This is Premier League star Steven Nzonzi speaking with police today yards from the spot where his car was involved in a smash with a cyclist. The Stoke City midfielder allegedly said: 'good luck finding me on foreign plates' before driving off last week, but the millionaire was spotted talking to an officer in Hale, Greater Manchester this afternoon. The crash led to an amazing . Twitter campaign backed by Sir Chris Hoy to identify the player, who . urged his 520,000 followers: 'please find him'. The star has so far been unavailable for comment but MailOnline can confirm he is the player involved. Speaking to police: An officer stopped Steven N'Zonzi by his car today less than 100 feet from where he was involved in a smash with a cylist . Incident: Rob Lockhart was cycling through Hale in Trafford at the time Nzonzi allegedly hit him last week . Olympic gold medal cyclist Sir Chris Hoy retweeted the image of the car driving off, and the above altercation between the motorist and Mr Lockhart, and urged the public to help detectives catch him . In question: Stoke midfielder Nzonzi is the Premier League player has been sought in connection with the incident . Today witnesses said the French . footballer was shopping and parked 100 yards from where the altercation . took place last week, and the officer waited next to his matt-black Audi Q7 for him to return. Greater . Manchester Police said they have identified the driver and plan to . speak to him at an appointment to be arranged for next week. It is understood the 24-year-old French . midfielder, who joined Stoke from Blackburn for £3million last summer, . has been advised by lawyers not to speak out in case it becomes a police . matter. Rob Lockhart said the driver refused to swap insurance details after the incident last week because 'it didn't apply' when an accident involves a bike and a car . Stoke manager Mark Hughes said today the player will play against Manchester City this weekend. He said: 'I spoke to Steven about it and he basically told me the situation. He doesn't feel he's done anything wrong and that's the top and bottom of it. 'I asked him about it and his explanation was clear, he was unequivocal about it. Will there be an investigation from the club? Absolutely not'. Greater Manchester Police have requested CCTV from a Hale bank so they can view the incident in detail . After hearing of the altercation, Olympic . legend Hoy retweeted a picture of the car and urged the public to help . detectives identify him. The cyclist, Rob Lockhart, claims the . player’s matt-black Audi Q7 braked suddenly in Hale, near Manchester, . last Thursday night and he bruised his face and damaged his bike after . smashing into the back. Mr Lockhart said: ‘He pulled away and . then pulled over sharply to park on double yellow lines outside a cash . point. It was dangerous. ‘I hit the back window with my head, helmet and face. I had mild concussion for two to three days afterwards. ‘He got out of his car and said, . “Sorry, I didn’t see you”. Then he just walked to the cashpoint. I . didn’t feel he had any regard for me and what had just happened. He . didn’t seem to care. ‘I was in shock, checking myself,  the . bike and the car to see what was damaged. When he walked back to his . car I said we need to exchange insurance details and he said “No”. He . said, “You’re on a bike and I’m in a car, it doesn’t matter”. He was . really laid back, not angry. He didn’t even check if his car was . damaged. ‘I tried to get my phone out to take a . picture and he laughed and said, “You won’t trace me because my plates . are foreign”. He then left the scene. ‘I called the police when I got home. I . don’t know who he was, he had a foreign accent. I don’t follow . football. I just want all this sorted out.’ Support: Olympic hero Sir Chris Hoy backed a Twitter campaign to identify the player . Message: Sir Chris Hoy retweeted the message and the attached pictures to his 529,000 followers . Two witnesses took photos of the car . and driver, which Lockhart shared on Twitter. Hoy was among thousands to . retweet the pictures and users soon responded by linking Nzonzi. Hoy retweeted: ‘This chap said “good . luck finding me on foreign plates” after knocking a cyclist over in . Hale. Please help find him.’ Stoke have refused to comment about Nzonzi’s involvement in the alleged incident. A spokesman for Greater Manchester . Police said: ‘On Thursday 5 September 2013, police received a report of a collision taking place at about 5.45pm, at the junction of Victoria Road and Ashley Road in Hale, Trafford. 'A cyclist had been in collision with an Audi Q7, but failed to give full details at the scene. The man suffered only minor injuries. 'The cyclist took a picture of the Audi, which was a matted black colour and was on French registration plates.

The IRS agent in charge of the Exempt Organizations Office in Cincinnati at a time when political groups were targeted for extra scrutiny has just received a promotion. Cindy Thomas, a 35-year IRS veteran, has been appointed to the senior technical adviser team for the Director of Exempt Organizations. The position became available after Sharon Light, who worked closely with Lois Lerner, left the organization. She was the sixth senior IRS official to leave since the scandal broke three months ago. New job: Cindy Thomas, pictured, was . the program manager of the IRS tax-exempt organizations determinations division and has now been promoted to the senior technical adviser team . Light left the job to take up a position with the American Cancer Society. Lerner is the embattled former head of the IRS Exemptions Office who has been called upon to testify before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. She is on administrative leave from the organization while investigations are ongoing, according to various media reports. Testify: Lois Lerner (pictured) who headed the division that oversees exempt organizations invoked the Fifth Amendment before Congress recently when questioned about IRS practices . Kenneth Corbin, who has taken up Lerner's position, wrote in an email to employees: . 'Cindy brings a strong background in EO Determinations and the history of the organization,' 'And, since she is located in Cincinnati, she will provide a voice for the process and challenges faced in determinations work.' According to a Fox News report, Thomas was the person in charge of IRS workers who dragged their feet on tax-exemption approvals. 'When an application for tax exempt status comes into the IRS, agents have 270 days to work through that application. If the application is not processed within those 270 days it automatically triggers flags in the system. 'So who in the chain of command would have received all these flags? The answer, according to the IRS directory, is one woman in Cincinnati, Cindy Thomas, the Program Manager of the Tax Exempt Division,' reported Fox News. Chain of command: Fox News created this graphic to show that Thomas was in charge of employees who sent probing letters to political groups . Death and taxes: The IRS has come under scrutiny over the past three months since it was revealed the organization may unfairly target political groups applying for tax exemptions . But the question of whether there was any type of political motivation for the IRS tax exemptions department's Be On The Lookout list has not yet been answered. According to Congressman Elijah Cummings, transcripts of an interview with an anonymous IRS manager who describes himself as a 'conservative Republican' reveal that the IRS agent told Congressional investigators he had initiated the targeted reviews without any instruction from the White House, and that they weren't politically motivated. On August 7, Representative Darrell Issa, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, requested documents, including emails between staff at the IRS and the Federal Electoral Commission, about the 'inappropriate coordination' of tax-exempt applications of various groups. So far, Cindy Thomas has not been called to appear before Congress. Share what you think . The comments below have not been moderated. ABritAbroad, . Monroe NC, United States, . 1 month ago .

Britain is the only major economy to have given far more than its ‘fair share’ of humanitarian aid to Syria, a report has found. This year, the UK has delivered close to £200million of aid to the region where the civil war has cost over 100,000 lives and left around 2million people homeless. It puts Britain’s contribution at 154 per cent of our ‘fair share’, which would be only £125million, according to an analysis by Oxfam of how much money countries are giving to the crisis, relative to their wealth. This year, the UK has delivered close to £200million of aid to the region where the civil war has cost over 100,000 lives . Despite having already exceeded this level by £68million, the amount delivered so far is only half the £400million the government has pledged to hand over since the conflict began two and a half years ago. The UK has paid a staggering 154 per cent of its 'fair share' towards aid in Syria . David Cameron, who lost a Commons vote on military strikes against the regime of dictator Bashar al-Assad, has promised the UK – the second largest donor to the conflict after the US - will ‘lead the world’ on getting food and medical aid to victims of the conflict. By contrast other major economies have fallen short – with France and Italy handing over just 47 per cent of their fair share, at £67million and £53million respectively. None of the rest of the G20 group of . countries – including the US, Canada, Japan and Germany – have met their . target except the UK and Saudi Arabia according to Oxfam. The US is the largest donor delivering . over £500million this year. But given its wealth and population this is . only 63 per cent of its fair share which was put at £800million. Russia . – a close ally of Assad – gave just 3 per cent of what would be . expected given the size of its economy, the report found. But . bottom of the list was New Zealand, whose economy has grown faster than . expected this year, but has given just £62,000– 1 per cent of its fair . share calculated at £6.7million. Mr . Cameron said earlier this month: ‘We are already the second largest aid . donor in delivering the humanitarian aid that is so needed both in . Syria and in the neighbouring countries like Jordan and Turkey. We’ll go . on doing that.’ Despite having already exceeded this level by £68million, the amount delivered so far is only half the £400million the government has pledged to hand over . He said the aid given so far had saved . ‘tens of thousands of lives’, and that he would push other countries to . do more at the recent G20 summit, however many have failed to act. Claire . Seaward, Oxfam’s campaigns manager for the Syria response, said: ‘The . crisis has got a lot worse this year and there are still a lot more . needs on the ground. Although our government has given 154 per cent, we . would still expect them to give more.’ David Cameron has promised the UK will 'lead the world' on getting food and medical aid to victims of the conflict . The . charity analysed each countries’ Gross National Income (GNI), which is . its wealth per head of population, and how much of the millions of . pounds it has pledged have actually been delivered to aid workers on the . ground. The list of nations includes . 28 traditional donor countries, and also Middle Eastern nations who have . donated to Syria mainly Gulf countries which support the rebels. Only . eight countries were gauged to be giving sufficient funds, with . oil-rich Kuwait the most generous at more than four and a half times its . fair share – at £200million. Other countries which exceeded their fair . share were Luxemburg, Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Oxfam’s . figures include all the aid given directly and via the United Nations, . European Union and charities such as the Red Cross and Oxfam so far this . year. The head of Oxfam’s . Syria programme, Colette Fearon, said: ‘While economic times are tough, . we are facing the largest man-made humanitarian disaster in two decades . and we have to seriously address it. ‘The . scale of this crisis is unprecedented and some countries must start to . show their concerns to the crisis in Syria by putting their hands in . their pockets. This is not the time for pledges. The situation demands . committed funds in order to save lives.’ International . development secretary Justine Greening visited Syrian refugees in .

Ed Balls sparked disbelief yesterday by claiming he had no idea Damian McBride was briefing against Labour colleagues . Ed Balls sparked disbelief yesterday by claiming he had no idea Damian McBride was briefing against Labour colleagues. The Shadow Chancellor insisted the former spin doctor was a ‘law unto himself’, saying he was horrified to learn what he was up to. Mr Balls worked side by side for years with Mr McBride helping plot Gordon Brown’s eventual path to Downing Street and his takeover from Tony Blair in 2007. In his book, Power Trip, the former spin doctor describes regular evenings out with Mr Balls and Mr Miliband. He, the Shadow Chancellor and Mr Brown shared a deep love of football and late night brainstorming sessions over pizza. Mr McBride even gives one whole chapter of his book to Mr Balls. BBC political editor Nick Robinson said a ‘collective eyebrow’ had been raised across Westminster when Mr Balls professed no knowledge of Mr McBride’s tactics. Even some of Mr Balls’s Shadow Cabinet colleagues were surprised at the vehemence of his denials. And Labour leader Ed Miliband has said he complained about Mr McBride’s behaviour to Mr Brown. But Mr Balls said: ‘Nobody ever came to me and complained about Damian McBride. I didn’t pass on those complaints to Gordon Brown. I didn’t complain about Damian McBride, because I don’t think until we saw the revelations in this book, we didn’t know what was going on. ‘I didn’t know that Damian McBride was doing personal briefings against ministers.’ Mr Balls said the first time he found out was when a ‘hideous’ email written by Mr McBride proposing to disseminate unfounded smears about the private lives of senior Conservatives was leaked in 2009. ‘I said to Damian “What have you done? How could it come to this?” I think it’s no way to do politics. I think Ed Miliband and I have moved politics and the Labour party a long way from those bad, bad times,’ he said. ‘It’s in the past. It’s irrelevant. It’s depressing. I’m happy to say that what I’ve seen in this book is shocking and despicable. It’s no way to do politics.’ Lola, aged two, looks on Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls pulls a face as he plays at the sandpit at the Roundabout Children's Centre in Brighton . Mr Balls later denied taking part in any negative briefing against colleagues. ‘That’s not something I’ve ever done,’ he said. ‘Damian McBride has come out and said he did some of those things. It was despicable. It was the wrong thing to do. Politics is tough. There have been times in the past where I’ve had strong arguments with Tony Blair on the euro, with Gordon Brown on different issues. But I’ve always done that in public and in an open way. ‘This kind of negative, nasty briefing is wrong, but also it’s a thing of the past. The Blair-Brown era is gone. There’s been none of it for the last three or four years. We’re in a better place now.’ When former No 10 spin doctor Alastair Campbell was asked by Channel 4 News if he shared the scepticism about the denial by Mr Balls, he replied: ‘You might say that, I couldn’t possibly comment.’ Mr Balls yesterday visited a children’s centre in Brighton on the second day of Labour’s conference in the town.

An Afghan Defense Ministry spokesman says the shooting took place on Saturday near the Pakistan border in the capital of eastern Paktia province, the city of Gardez. A security official there says the attack took place inside a base of the Afghan army in Gardez.So far this year, 11 foreign soldiers have been killed in such attacks, including the attack on Saturday. The surge in insider attacks is a sign of how security has deteriorated as NATO prepares its military exit from Afghanistan by the end of 2014. The U.S. will remain with about 68,000 troops at the end of September. NATO and U.S. forces are working with the Afghan government to tighten vetting procedures and increase security between the forces, but nothing has so far been able to stem the attacks on troops, which NATO frequently asserts are standing 'shoulder by shoulder.'In unusually blunt remarks to the Pentagon's own news service, the American Forces Press Service, Dempsey said the Afghan government needs to take the problem as seriously as do U.S. commanders and officials.","So far this year, 11 soldiers have been killed in insider attacks .

Each child needs a bedroom to themselves to fulfil their academic potential, the Education Secretary has said. Michael Gove said having a ‘room of one’s own’ provided space to learn and read. But he was immediately accused of hypocrisy as critics pointed out that new Government rules decree a child aged under 16 in a home receiving housing benefit has to share a room with a sibling of the same gender. Michael Gove said having a 'room of one's own' provided space to learn and read . The so-called ‘bedroom tax’ also means that brothers and sisters will have to share rooms until the age of ten. Mr Gove said more children will be able to enjoy having their own bedroom in future because of the Government’s planning reforms, which aim to encourage the building of larger properties. Developers have been urged to end the proliferation of ‘rabbit hutch’ estates and develop family-sized homes. The Education Secretary told an audience at the Policy Exchange think-tank: ‘My colleague, [planning minister] Nicholas Boles, is making changes to the planning regime. ‘These are changes which are social justice changes.

Gove was accused of hypocrisy as the Government's so-called bedroom tax means children aged under 16 in a home receiving housing benefit has to share a room with a sibling of the same gender . ‘There are schoolchildren who do not have rooms of their own in which to do their homework, in which to read, in which to achieve their full potential. Nick Boles’ planning reforms will make it easier for more homes of a larger size to be built for children.’ Mr Gove lashed out at ‘nimbys’ who tried to block the liberalisation of planning laws, adding: ‘When people oppose these planning reforms, I think they are actually standing in the way of helping our children to grow tall.’ But Liam Byrne, Labour’s work and pensions spokesman, seized on the Education Secretary’s remarks, saying: ‘Even Michael Gove now admits that the bedroom tax is a vicious policy that holds children back. ‘This hated policy should be dropped and dropped now.’ Mr Gove was supported yesterday by Mr Boles, who criticised councils which use protecting the greenbelt as an ‘excuse’ not to build new homes.","Michael Gove said a 'room of one's own' provides space to learn and read .

The popularity of smartphones means that children are taking an average of £120-worth of gadgets with them to school. One in 10 children aged between six and ten also takes a tablet device while 22 per cent of mothers say their child's items are worth more than those they carry in their handbag. Research has found that the contents of school bags across the country are worth almost £1billion. Go go gadget: The average school bag contains electronic devices worth more than £120, with more than half of 11 to 16 year olds carrying a smartphone in theirs . But less than a fifth of parents say that they have sufficient insurance to cover what's in their child's school bag even though 19 per cent of parents say they know the bag is left unattended in public. Around half of those that do have personal possessions insurance say that they do not understand their policy. Jane Symonds, spokesman for the Money Advice Service said: 'Electronic devices are so integral to our everyday lives now. 'It's incredible how quickly they have become ""must-have"" items - even for children as young as six years old. 'Given how attached we get to essential items such as smartphones or e-readers, it's worrying how many parents don't fully understand which valuables are covered by their insurance policies.'

"By . Ruth Styles . PUBLISHED: . 05:59 EST, 23 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:07 EST, 24 September 2013 . From Elisabeth Moss' monochrome gown to Christina Hendricks' typically glamorous all-black ensemble, this year's EMMYs was a vintage night for style fans - particularly those with a penchant for Mad Men. But for every Alyson Hannigan (uncharacteristically getting it spot on in purple Marchesa), there was a Lena Dunham showing off her tattoos in an unflattering gown. FEMAIL rounds up the fashion winners and losers from last night. Winners: Mad Men stars Christina Hendricks and Elisabeth Moss triumphed on the fashion front at the EMMYs . WINNERS . Mad Men star Elisabeth Moss looked wonderful in a on-trend monochrome gown with a daring textured skirt, which she teamed with newly blond locks and crimson lips. Also looking good was her Mad Men co-star Christina Hendricks whose curvaceous figure was set off beautifully by her classic black gown. Claire Danes, a big winner on the night, also took home a host of fashion plaudits thanks to her daring Armani Prive couture gown. Teamed with a crimson pout, low key jewels and a perfectly-groomed faux-bob, Danes offered a masterclass in red carpet dressing. Helen McCrory, wife of Dane's co-star Damien Lewis, was another who made red carpet dressing look easy courtesy of an elegant cream gown that showed off her toned arms and was accessorised with aplomb. Perfect: Zooey Deschanel stayed true to her quirky style while Christina Hendricks' gown flattered her curves . Beautiful: Kerry Washington in lavishly embroidered Marchesa . Glamour: January Jones made minimal work beautifully for her . Ruffled: Actress Julia Bowen was chic in Zac Posen . Looking good: Mad Men's Elisabeth Moss looked lovely in monochrome while Kelly Osbourne was pretty in red . Chic: Julianna Marguiles looked sensational in white while Rose Byrne daringly bared her toned midriff . Masterclass: Alison Hannigan was pretty in purple while Helen McCrory pulled off a difficult dress with aplomb . Elegant: Claire Danes won over the fashion crowd as well as TV fans with her Armani Prive dress . Another winner was Zooey Deschanel who stayed true to her style roots in a quirky sky blue dress by J Mendel. Complete with a huge, whimsical bow and split to the thigh, Deschanel's dress was a gamble that paid off in style. Minimal jewellery and a tiny box clutch completed the look without distracting attention from the show-stopping dress. January Jones and Kerry Washington, both in nude lace, channelled old-fashioned Hollywood glamour, particularly Washington whose lavishly embroidered Marchesa dress looked (and probably cost) a million dollars. Rose Byrne was elegant in pale pink floor-sweeping skirt and cropped shell top that offered a glimpse of her toned midriff. Other winners included Kelly Osbourne, who looked wonderful in crimson, Alyson Hannigan, who was pretty in purple, and Juliana Marguiles who was pretty in a monochrome strapless gown. LOSERS . Leading the losers was Girls actress Lena Dunham, who sported an unflattering floral tented frock by Prada that didn't fit properly and jarred with the tattoos covering her shoulders. Fellow Girls star Zosia Mamet also failed to impress fashion critics, plumping for a splotch-print gown that included a curious tiny leather bust patch. Tats not good! Lena's tattoos clashed with the pretty floral print and the shape did nothing for her figure . Equally baffling was Heidi Klum's choice of a maroon sequinned gown that managed to make her look a little frumpy and squat - no mean feat on a supermodel. Another who got it wrong was Game of Thrones star Lena Headey whose transparent black dress did absolutely nothing for her figure. Carrie Underwood was another star whose dress was sheer horror - compounded by the sickly green hue that left her looking sallow. Michelle Dockery's two-tone Prada gown also left critics confused, although the claret colour did provide a striking counterpoint to her pale complexion. While Dockery's dress divided opinion, there was no confusion over Paula Abdul. Her hideous gold lame dress left her looking like an extra from Star Wars. Lena, Zosia, Paula: it might be time to sack that stylist. Controversial: Michelle Dockery's Prada dress has divided opinion . Unflattering: Heidi Klum in a maroon sequinned dress . Ageing: Kaley Cuoco's claret gown made her look sallow . Ghastly: Zosia Mamet's dress included an odd leather bust patch while Paula Abdul's dress was truly dire .

The mother of missing toddler Ayla Reynolds has released new details from evidence photographs taken in the wake of her daughter's disappearance where she claims blood was spattered on a car seat and baby doll. Trista Reynolds, 25, is fighting to find out what happened to two-year-old Ayla, who vanished on December 17, 2011 . while staying at the home of her father Justin DiPietro in Waterville, . Maine. Her body has never been found. In a statement posted online on Monday, Reynolds provided previously unreleased details she said police investigators told her about her daughter's case. Reynolds says she wants the public to appeal to the state attorney general's office to file charges against DiPietro. Scroll down for video . Trista Reynolds, 25, pictured this month, holds a photo of her 20-month-old daughter Ayla as she reveals the details of new evidence photos shown to her by police in Westbrook, Maine . Ms Reynolds said in January this year, Maine State Police showed her a slideshow of evidence pictures of blood in different locations at her ex-boyfriend's home. In a statement posted to websites JusticeForAyla and United4Ayla on Monday, Ms Reynolds claims that Ayla’s blood was found in several rooms inside the house, on the sofa and on the little girl's car seat in DiPietro’s vehicle. According to Ms Reynolds, droplets were also found on Ayla's princess slippers and smeared across the face of a baby doll she played with. The mother said it looked as if her daughter had tried to wipe away the blood. Blood was also found on DiPietro's sneakers, according to the statement and on the mattress and sheets in the father's basement bedroom. Ms Reynolds also alleged that police showed her pictures of blood splashes on the floor and walls. Fighting for the truth: Trista Reynolds cradles her one-month-old son Anthony as she discusses the disappearance of her daughter Ayla two years ago . She told BangorDailyNews.com last . week: 'After seeing [the evidence], it has started to settle in my mind . that Ayla more than likely really is deceased and not coming back. I’m . not just able to close my eyes and not see her blood.' Copies of the photographs or other evidence were not given to Ms Reynolds. Maine Deputy Attorney General Bill Stokes says decisions on whether to file charges are based on evidence, not public pressure. Miss Reynolds also has two sons. She gave birth to Anthony last month and has a two-year-old son Raymond. By . revealing details of alleged evidence, Ms Reynolds intends to put pressure on the three people . who were at the home when Ayla disappeared on December 17 - her . ex-boyfriend Justin, his sister Elisha and Justin's girlfriend Courtney Roberts. No one has ever been charged in the case. Justin DiPietro told police that his daughter disappeared during the night. Miss Reynolds was attending a ten-day rehab program at the time her daughter disappeared. The mother also claims that police have failed to keep her up-to-date on developments in her daughter's case. Desperate: Trista Reynolds is coming forward with evidence against her ex that she hopes will reignite the search for her daughter Ayla who went missing in December 2011 . Mom: Ayla, right, was in her father's custody while her mother, Trista Reynolds, left, checked into a 10-day rehab programme . She . said that she doesn't know if releasing new information will be . detrimental to the case, she told BDN, but she wants to move things . forward. Maine investigators confirmed that they met with Ms Reynolds in January 2013 but re-iterated that they have 'no reaction' to her decision to speak publicly. The news of the bloodstains last weekend came several days after DiPietro's arrest for violating the conditions of his bail for a . different charge. DiPietro was charged with the domestic . violence assault of his ex-girlfriend Courtney Roberts in July and one . of his bail conditions was that he not use or possess alcohol. Earlier this month he was stopped by traffic police due to his car's expired . inspection sticker. The officer discovered alcohol in the car and he was . brought in. Father: Justin DiPietro, left, told cops he last saw Ayla, right, when . he put her to bed. He said she was wearing green . pyjamas with polka dots and the words ‘Daddy's Princess’ on them . Father and daughter: Ayla's blood was found in the partially finished basement that DiPietro used as his bedroom . Ms Reynolds says that police showed her pictures of her daughter's blood that was found in DiPietro's basement, room, and truck. A sample of the blood showed that the toddler's saliva was mixed with it, leading Ms Reynolds to believe that she suffered. Police have not arrested DiPietro . because there is no evidence to prove that he was the one who killed his . daughter but they have said that they do not think it is reasonable to . believe that she is still alive. Di Pietro has maintained his innocence. Mystery: Ayla Reynolds, of Waterville, Maine, . was reported missing in December 2011 by her father .

A daring duo took their lives in their hands to scale a spectacular frozen waterfall as it melted beneath their feet. The climb in Ouray, Colorado, was certainly not for the faint of heart, with one wrong step potentially sending them sliding nearly 100ft to almost certain death at the foot of the sheer ice sheet.

Ouray, Colorado . Slippery: One wrong step could have sent Mr Leblanc plunging nearly 100ft down the frozen waterfall to almost certain death at its frozen base . Don't look down! After the climb Mr Denis spoke . of the intoxicating mixture of adrenaline and fear that possessed him . and Mr Leblanc when they first saw the ice column . Adventure: The frozen waterfall dangling from the San Juan mountains, in a region nicknamed 'the Switzerland of America', was approximately 82ft tall . Adventure sport photographer Alain . Denis, 40, captured these spectacular images of his partner Calixte . Leblanc, 32, taking on the ascent. Using . ice tools, ice screws, crampons and a harness, brave Mr Denis and his . climbing compatriot were able to reach the top of the waterfall in a . mere twenty minutes. 'This . was the first time we were able to climb the frozen waterfall,' said Mr . Denis. 'In the previous years, the [ice] never got fat enough for us to . do it, or didn't reach all the way to the ground.

The . frozen waterfall dangling from the San Juan mountains, in a region . nicknamed 'the Switzerland of America', was approximately 82ft tall.

Talking about the climb, Mr Denis explained: 'Once we got back to the car park at the bottom of the mountain, a local told us that we had just completed the first accent of the frozen waterfall. 'We later found out that only a few more ascents were completed after us, and several weeks later the pillar fell down .

He was once the world's fattest man weighing in at a staggering 70 stone and consuming a mammoth 20,000 calories a day. But it seems that after losing 48 stone following NHS surgery, it's not just Paul Mason's health that has a more promising outlook - his weight loss may have also boosted his love life. Mr Mason has only known his new girlfriend Rebecca Mountain for a month and the pair are yet to meet, but already the 52-year old claims that Miss Mountain is the love of his life. Scroll down for video . Romance: Although they have never met, Paul Mason, pictured, says that Rebecca Mountain is the love of his love . New love: Paul Mason, pictured while at his heaviest, has a new American girlfriend after shedding almost 48 stone . The former postman, of Ipswich, Suffolk, said: 'I can't wait to spend the rest of our lives together. 'I can't think about anyone else and nor can she.' The pair met online last month when Miss Mountain, of Orange, near Boston, Massachusetts, saw a television documentary about Mr Mason's extreme obesity - the result, he says, of overeating when a previous relationship ended. She was so touched by his plight that Miss Mountain got in touch via Facebook keen to help Mr Mason in his bid to get the NHS to pay for a second operation to rid him of layers of excess skin. Mr Mason said: 'She watched my documentary and thought ""I want to help to find this chap help"".' 'She didn't really think anything romantically to start with, she just wanted to help me find someone who will operate. 'I was a bit cautious to start with but as soon as I met her on Skype I felt at ease. We talked for four-and-a-half hours.

'She felt the same and brought up the idea of us being boyfriend and girlfriend.' Mr Mason says that he doesn't go for looks and finds Miss Mountain's determined attitude particularly attractive.

'We became really close friends and now we are boyfriend and girlfriend. 'She really wants to come over and see me and I am just desperate to meet her face-to-face, I am so excited.

'It was hard for me to accept to start with because part of me is still trapped in this loose skin and I find it hard to understand how anyone can see through that.

New goal: Paul Mason hopes to have another operation to help him remove layers of excess skin after his weight loss, with the help of Rebecca, right . 'But since Rebecca's been in my life I've got a whole new sense of worth and excitement.' Mr Mason ballooned to his incredible . size by eating ten times the amount needed by a normal man due to a . compulsive eating disorder. He claimed his binge eating began in his 20s at the time of his father's death and a . deterioration in his mother's health. Mr Mason quit his job as a postman when his weight prevented him from completing his deliveries. As his weight soared he was left unable . to stand or walk before finally becoming bed-ridden and being looked . after full time by council carers.

For under $4million, a private island home off the coast of Connecticut can be yours along with the chance to discover a chest full of pirate's gold rumored to be buried underneath. One of history's most infamous swashbucklers, Captain Kidd, is said to have stashed a hefty treasure somewhere in the chain of rocky Thimble Islands in the Long Island Sound as he fled 17th century pirate hunters. If the 1-acre Belden Island happens to be where Kidd's X marked the spot, then the $3.95million asking price is nothing short of a steal. Scroll down for video . Gold in them thar islands: Belden Island is one of the Thimble Islands off the coast of Branford, Connecticut. Infamous pirate Captain Kidd is said to have stashed some of his treasure on one of the islands in the late 17th century . A steal: Belden Island, complete with its 4-bedroom, 100-year-old cottage is on sale for $3.95 million . The seven room cottage was built in 1912 and remains almost perfectly preserved, with floor-to-ceiling wainscoting that lends a maritime feel that would make Captain Kidd himself feel right at home. The cottage is designed in the colonial style and features a wraparound porch with stunning 360-degree water views. The island's current owner, Christine Svenningsen, purchased Belden as part of her late-90s and early 2000s buy up of nine islands in the Thimble chain. Svenningsen paid $2.66 million for Belden Island in 2006, reports Curbed. Verdant: Belden's 7-room summer cottage even has its own manicured lawn, making any suburban-dwelling treasure enthusiast feel right at home . Shiver me checkbook: A fanciful painting by Howard Pyle shows Kidd and his men burying a hefty treasure. Could it be beneath the cottage on Belden Island? Only $3.95 million will let you find out . Captain William Kidd was born around 1645, the callous corsair was a clergyman's son from Greenock, near Glasgow, who moved to New York for adventure. He started his seagoing career as a privateer - a mercenary licensed by William III to hunt Britain's enemies, usually the French or Spanish. The Crown was supposed to get ten per cent of privateers' plunder, but Kidd often kept all his loot. In 1695 he left London in the Adventure Galley, a 284-tonner with a crew of 150 and 34 cannon. Late in 1696, he attacked a British East India Company convoy and was declared a pirate. In 1698, he took his greatest prize, the Quedah Merchant. A 400-ton Moorish trader from Armenia, it was loaded with gold, silver and fine silks. The Adventure Galley was by now rotting and leaky. So he scuttled her, renamed the Quedah Merchant the Adventure Prize, and sailed for the Caribbean. Kidd then went north in a sloop. Sometime in 1699, the legend of the Connecticut treasure was born as Kidd arrived in the Long Island Sound, the location of the Thimble Islands. Here, he is said to have buried his considerable treasure while avoiding capture. That summer, his one-time backer, the Earl of Bellomont, lured him to Boston and Kidd was captured. After a trial said to have lasted just a single day, Kidd was found guilty of murder and piracy. On May 23, 1701, Kidd was hanged and the secret of his treasure's exact location in the Thimble Islands died along with him. Antique: The perfectly preserved cottage was built in 1912 and features original wainscoting throughout . Homey: The all-wood interior gives the four-bedroom summer cottage a maritime feel that would make Captain Kidd himself feel right at home . Scenic: The colonial-style cottage has a wrap-around porch and 360-degree views of Long Island Sound. In the background, the city of Branford, Connecticut can be seen . At some point in the cottage's 100-plus year existence, a professionally manicured lawn was installed, so even the most suburban of homeowners will feel comfortable. There is also a small sand beach and an expansive, rocky shore along with a new dock. The cottage has gas fireplaces and vintage gas lighting and water is pumped in from the nearby city of Branford, Connecticut. Heating for the four-bedroom vacation home is provided by a coal/wood stove and propane. Potential buyers should note that a boat for traveling to and from the island is not included. And to interested treasure seekers: neither is a shovel. The full listing of the island and cottage can be seen here. Roomy: The manicured lawn opens up onto expansive rock beaches and a small sand beach. All told, the island is just over 1 acre .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 11:17 EST, 24 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:21 EST, 24 September 2013 . Kasey Caron, 17, a student at Richland High School in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, was assigned as female at birth, but identifies and presents as male . A Pennsylvania school board has denied a request from a transgender student to run for homecoming king - putting him on the ballot for homecoming queen instead. Kasey Caron, 17, was born a girl, . but identifies as a boy - including in his daily life in high school. Richland, Pennsylvania, School Board solicitor Timothy Leventry says Pennsylvania law requires a person born female to have a physician certify a sex change operation and have their birth certificate changed to legally be considered male. As a result, the Richland board refused to recognize Kasey as a boy - even though the high school senior's classmates and teachers refer to Kasey as 'him.' The Kasey's family members said they were disappointed by the board's decision. 'My heart sunk a little,' Kasey's mother Kathy Caron said. Kasey was born with polycystic ovary syndrome, a condition that leads to a hormone imbalance where the ovaries make more androgens – sometimes called male hormones – than normal and has had to field the question ‘Are you a boy or . a girl?’ throughout his childhood. For the bulk of his four years at . Richland High School in Johnstown, Caron's teachers and classmates have . recognized him as male. When . a guidance counselor suggested he enter his name for homecoming king at . the beginning of the school year, Caron thought the school was finally . ready to accept his gender identity, reports The Johnstown . Tribune-Democrat. But . on the day the student body was scheduled to vote for the homecoming . court, administrators told Caron that their legal counsel had informed . them they were required to list Caron's name on the female ballot, . because he is legally identified as female on his driver's license. The school board at Richland High School agreed to discuss Caron's plight at a meeting on Monday night, but ultimately no final decision was taken . Even though Caron was listed as female on the ballot, Richland students voted him onto the homecoming court. Recognizing . Caron's 'unique situation,' administrators told him he could attend the . homecoming parade with a date of his choice, rather than automatically . pairing him with another male student running for homecoming king. While Caron was considering the school's offer, his mother, Kathy Caron, and her partner, Cindy Theys, got involved and contacted various groups to mount a defense of their son. 'There . is a legal side of this issue and there is a practical side,' school board solicitor Timothy Leventry told the Johnstown . Tribune-Democrat after hearing from Kasey and other supporters. Kasey Caron has the full support of his family, including his two moms, his father, his siblings, and his transgender godmother in Maryland . 'The . school board has looked at the legal side.

The Duchess of Cornwall has spoken of her pride at opening a new cancer support centre in Aberdeen today. Camilla was without her husband Prince Charles but was still in royal company as the Queen of Norway, Queen Sonja, also attended the opening of the Elizabeth Montgomerie Building, next to the city's Royal Infirmary hospital. The building is named after golfer Colin Montgomerie's mother and is a branch of the Maggie's Cancer Care charity which he set up in her memory after she died of cancer in 1991.

If you spend every single day in a zoo enclosure, you could be forgiven for wanting some privacy now and again. But this extrovert otter still went out of his way to wow the crowds by juggling with a pebble. He put on a show for visitors to the Sea Life Abenteuer Park in Oberhausen, Germany, to the delight of those around. Scroll down for video . Talented: An otter at the Sea Life Abenteuer Park in Oberhausen, Germany, picks up a pebble to show off his juggling skills to visitors .

After scrabbling about with the small . rock, he begins rolling it across his chest before he hits his stride . and begins tossing it higher and higher. But while his cute display may be amazing the humans, the otter laying right next to him barely seems to notice. The . other creature, potentially the juggler's partner, looks lazily over . out of one eye before deciding she has better ways to spend her time. The performing scamp is part of a family of Asian short-claws otters that live in the park, which also has penguins, sea turtles, jellyfish, sharks and giant Japanese Spider Crabs. 'Look what I've found': The otter grabs a pebble and looks around before his performance . Ready...: The otter gets ready to launch the rock, to the bemusement of his partner . Asian short-clawed otters are the smallest species of otter in the world, and weigh only 5kg. The furry animals live in water, but their fur is so thick that their bodies never actually get wet. They are often tamed and used as pest control to rid rice paddies of crabs. The mammals can live for up to 16 years and stay faithful to their mate for life. Otters have . many quirky habits, including banging rocks against clams and on their . tummies to crack shells. At night, sea otters hold hands with their mate while they sleep to stop them floating apart. Great catch!: He starts to throw the pebble back and forth .

A council leader who subjected his wife to a decade of abuse shot her dead then  killed himself when he found out she was considering leaving him, an inquest heard. Keith Johnson, 58, was described by 44-year-old Andrea as someone who would ‘change like the devil’ when they were alone. Details of her years of torment at his hands only emerged in a secret diary discovered after her death. Murder-suicide: Keith Johnson, left, shot his wife Andrea, right, dead outside their home before turning the gun on himself . Violent: A diary kept by Mrs Johnson and found by police after the couple had died, revealed that Mr Johnson subjected his wife to a decade of abuse . The couple, who had been together for more than 20 years, had an ‘open relationship’ and each had affairs. But . after learning she was considering ending their marriage Johnson, the . Tory leader of North Norfolk District Council and former mayor of . Cromer, wrote out wills and funeral instructions, before luring her to . her death outside their home. He was yesterday described as a ‘monster’ by her family. In . one diary entry, soon after they married in 2004, shop assistant Mrs . Johnson wrote: ‘He doesn’t seem bothered he is hurting me, said I either . like it or lump it.’ Later she described how he would ‘change like the devil’ and in another entry said: ‘He’s done it so often it doesn’t matter.’ Investigation: Police guard the scene at Compit Hills in Cromer, Norfolk, where Mr Johnson killed his wife and then himself in December last year . Deliberate: The inquest heard that Mr Johnson planned to kill his wife with her own shotgun after luring her back to the house telling her that he would not be violent . The . inquest in Norwich heard yesterday how she had been in ‘a close . relationship’ with cleaning  company director Robert Jeans, 62, in the . months before her death. Harrowing: Police only found Mrs Johnson's diary during a search of the house following her death . Johnson threw her out of their bungalow in Compit Hills, near Cromer, and she went to stay with Mr Jeans nearby. The next day Mr Jeans drove her back to her marital home after Johnson invited them for a chat and promised not to harm her. Mr . Jeans told the inquest how he did not get out of his car and drove . away, leaving Mrs Johnson talking to her husband on their driveway. Mrs . Johnson called 999 at 2.28pm to report that her husband was on the . driveway with a shotgun and the operator heard a gunshot and her . screams. Several minutes later Johnson went into the back garden and shot himself with one of his wife’s four licensed shotguns. Police . found a series of notes, including details of how to dispose of the . estate and how the couple should be buried, suggesting he had planned . the murder on  December 2 last year. Post mortems found Mrs Johnson died of a single shotgun wound to the chest and her husband from a shotgun wound to his neck. After . the inquest, a domestic violence homicide review was published . detailing how Johnson abused his spouse, who he saw as a ‘trophy wife’. It contained details of the diary which referred to the times when he . beat her while drunk and had sex with other women in front of her at . their home. Mrs Johnson’s . family told of their horror at the revelations. Outside court, her . sister Sharon Thorpe said: ‘We wish we had known you were suffering so . we could have helped you.

A teenager who shed almost six stone after seeing ‘horrendous’ prom photos of herself has been crowned Young Slimmer of the Year. The weightloss has given Paige Stoodley, 18, from Telford, the confidence to go to university to train to be a nurse. She has also been crowned Slimming World Young Slimmer of the Year 2013 after going from 16st 11lb to a svelte 11st, dropping five dress sizes. Scroll down for video . Weightloss Queen: Paige Stoodley is Slimming World Young Slimmer of the Year after losing 6 stone when she saw her prom dress pictures. Paige is now starting Keele University feeling more confident than ever . The 5ft 6in teenager says she had struggled with her weight for years and admitted she used to be a comfort eater. She said: 'For as long as I remember I've always been bigger than my friends. I was a very emotional eater, I used food as a reward for doing well or as a comforter if I’d had a bad day.' Paige unsuccessfully tried losing dieting for years but couldn't stick to cutting out her favourite calorific foods. However, weighing in at 17st and struggling to shop for her prom dress, Paige’s grandmother persuaded her to go to a Slimming World class with her in April 2012. She said: 'At the age of 17 I was almost 17st and I knew something had to change. 'Shopping for my prom dress was probably one of the worst experiences I've ever had. I was so excited and had all these ideas in my head of how I wanted to look, but the reality was that every dress I liked either didn't fit or looked horrendous. New woman: The 5ft 6in teenager from Telford says she had struggled with her weight for years and admitted she used to be a comfort eater . 'I felt so embarrassed that I ended up just wanting to go home. I did find a dress in the end but I didnt like any of the photos of me in it.' Paige found the Slimming World system of eating a balanced diet, rather than a restricted one, was easier for her to stick to and the pounds soon started to fall off. She said: 'Being able to eat pasta and potatoes without weighing and measuring them out seemed too good to be true, and I loved being able to have a treat like a bar of chocolate or a bag of crisps when I fancied one as well. The turning point: It was this photograph, left, that spurred Paige to lose weight and she's since dropped from a dress size 22 to 12 . 'It’s about learning how to balance your diet, not restricting yourself.' Attending the group each week, Paige learned about healthy eating. She swapped her unhealthy breakfast of pasties and sausage rolls for cereal with semi-skimmed milk topped with chopped banana or berries. She also started cooking her favourite meals - spaghetti bolognese and homemade beef burgers with potato wedges and salad - for herself and her parents, instead of having takeaways. The cooking skills she has picked up will serve her well when she starts her first term at Keele University later this month. New diet: The teen swapped her unhealthy breakfast of pasties and sausage rolls for cereal with semi-skimmed milk topped with chopped banana or berries and watched the weight drop off . She explained: 'What I liked is that the plan put me in control. I was given all the information, support and tools I needed but the choice - about what weight I wanted to be or what I wanted to eat - and the responsibility was mine. 'It makes me feel so proud of what I’ve achieved, more so than if I’d have just been doing as I was told or following some strict regime for a short period of time. 'I know I’ll have to live on a fairly tight budget at university but I think I’ve learned a lot about value for money and how to get healthy, tasty food without spending too much - I love big pasta dishes and jacket potatoes. Control: She says the diet plan put her in control and she can still eat some treats in moderation . 'I still manage to eat out with my friends and go on nights out too so I’m not worried about socialising either.' Since starting at Slimming World, Paige, who also walks regularly now instead of taking the bus, has dropped from a dress size 22 to a 12. It was after she started losing weight that she decided to apply to study the demanding course of mental health nursing at university, saying: 'I know nursing can be quite physical and you’re on your feet a lot so I was worried I wouldn’t have been able to cope with that side of things when I was bigger. 'I’m sure that my weight loss helped me get accepted onto my course too. I think I was able to get across my enthusiasm and passion for nursing because I feel better about myself. I feel like I make a better first impression, so I could focus on the interview itself.' New life: Now she has lost weight, she has the confidence to head to university to study mental health nursing . 'I feel better about myself. I feel like I make a better first impression, so I could focus on the interview itself' said Paige of gaining a place on the course . Share what you think .

US singer Kelly Clarkson has been thwarted in her bid to take a ring once owned by Jane Austen out of the UK. The American Idol winner bought the gold and turquoise ring for £150,000 but ministers moved to impose an export ban to block her taking it to the US in the hope of finding a British buyer. Donations from Austen fans from around the world, and TV gardener Alan Titchmarsh, flooded in and has now been bought by the Jane Austen's House Museum. Precious: The ring is one of only three surviving pieces of jewellery known to have belonged to Jane Austen . Thwarted: American Idol winner Kelly Clarkson has been told she can't take the ring out of the UK . The ring had been in the Austen family for around 200 years before it was sold at auction last year. Clarkson, the first winner of talent show American Idol, saw off seven bidders in an auction at Sotheby’s last year for the gold and turquoise ring. Still in its original box, it was sold for $235,596 despite being expected to fetch only $46,362. But when Clarkson applied for an export license, a reviewing committee recommended that the ring should be kept in the UK. The Jane Austen's House Museum in Chawton, Hampshire, where the writer spent the last eight years of her life and where she penned all of her six completed novels, launched its fundraising campaign in August. It has now raised £157,740 to secure the ring which is expected to go on display in the New Year. Donations included a single pledge of £100,000 from an anonymous donor. Jane's house: This house in Chawton, Hampshire, is where Jane Austen spent the last eight years of her life, and now houses the Jane Austen's House museum . Clarkson said that she was glad that the museum had acquired the item. ‘The ring is a beautiful national treasure and I am happy to know that so many Jane Austen fans will get to see it at Jane Austen's House Museum,’ she said. It is not known whether Austen bought or was given the ring - which contains the December turquoise birthstone (Austen's birth month) - and symbolises wisdom and spiritual journeys. Donor: TV gardener Alan Titchmarsh was among those to give money to the campaign to keep the ring in the UK . After the world-famous author's death in 1817 from an unknown illness, the ring was passed to her sister Cassandra who then gave it to her sister-in-law Eleanor Austen on her engagement to the Reverend Henry Thomas Austen. Mary Guyatt, curator of the museum, which celebrates the 200th anniversary of the publication of Pride And Prejudice this year, said: ‘The Museum has been stunned by the generosity and light-footedness of all those who have supported our campaign to meet the costs of acquiring Jane Austen’s ring for our permanent collection. ‘Visitors come from all around the world to see the house where she once lived and we will now take great pleasure in displaying this pretty ring for their appreciation. ‘The Government’s decision to decline an export licence reflects how rarely Austen’s personal effects turn up in today’s art market, and having missed out at auction in 2012 we are thrilled to have had this second chance to bring it home to Chawton.’ Culture Minister Ed Vaizey said: ‘The export licensing system provides us with a “last chance” to save treasures like these for the nation so they can be enjoyed by all of us. It’s clear from the number of people who gave generously to the campaign just how admired Jane Austen remains to this day.’ The museum, which has also raised enough cash to pay for costs associated with showing the ring, such as its display and insurance, already has two other pieces of jewellery owned by the author of Sense And Sensibility and Emma  - a turquoise bracelet and a topaz cross. Austen is set to appear on the new £10 banknote following a campaign to have a woman on the currency. Share what you think . The comments below have not been moderated. Lamour, . somewhere in USA, United States, . 1 day ago . I think Kelly Clarkson should sell the ring back at a higher price to the drama queens.

Henderson, . 1 day ago . Sorry, but Clarkson won the auction and should be able to do anything she wants with the ring.  The facts are: The UK government, after the auction, refused to let Clarkson take HER ring out of the UK.  Now if it were me and I put down all that money for a ring I would have sold it for double to whoever could come up with the cash.  I would have set the price after auction, not just accepted the price I paid.  This due to the fact that IT WAS MY RING, not the UK governments or anyone elses.  If the UK didn't want the ring to leave the country then the auction should have been limited to UK buyers prior to the auction beginning, but that makes too much sense. Elizabeth, . Seattle, . 1 day ago . The money has to be raised to much the price paid, so that the buyer will not lose money. This is the same with works of art. Relatively recently a Titian was going to be bought privately, but money was raised for it to be bought for the nation, and it is now split between the National Gallery and The National  Gallery of Scotland. This is essentially the same situation. I understand that Kelly Clarkson has been gracious about what has happened and understands that the ring will exhibited to the public. I agree that perhaps a replica could be made for her. mattprice1707, . S.Wales, United Kingdom, . 1 day ago .

This is a common situation, although it normally occurs with works of art, not jewellery. If could not get an export licence, she will not have to pay for the ring. I am glad it is staying in the UK.

A Georgia woman convicted of lying to investigators about the shooting death of her husband outside a preschool was today sentenced to four years in prison. A judge handed down a five-year sentence to Andrea Sneiderman but said she would get credit for time she's served in custody and under house arrest, trimming her time behind bars to four years. Sneiderman had begged through tears earlier today for the judge to be lenient for the sake of her children. Prosecutors had asked for a 20-year sentence after Sneiderman was convicted of perjury and other counts. Scroll down for verdict video . Tears: Andrea Sneiderman, pictured on Tuesday, sobbed as she asked the judge to be lenient in her sentencing . All ears: Andrea Sneiderman listens as her sentence is handed down by Judge Adams during her sentencing hearing . Sneiderman's former boss, who was also her alleged lover, was convicted of fatally shooting her husband outside a preschool in suburban Atlanta in 2010. She was initially charged with murder, but prosecutors dropped the murder case and instead went forward with perjury charges and other counts. On Monday, Sneiderman was found guilty on nine of 13 felony counts. Prosecutors accused the mother-of-two of making false statements to police investigating her husband's slaying and lying under oath during the trial of Hemy Neuman. The 13-count indictment included charges of making false statements, hindering an investigation and perjury. Hugs: Andrea Sneiderman hugs defense attorney Tom Clegg before her sentencing Tuesday and looks emotional, right, as she is dealt her fate . Disappointed: Andrea Sneiderman leaves court in handcuffs after her sentence was handed down by Judge Adams on Tuesday . Sneiderman, 37, was found guilty of . four counts of perjury, hindering the apprehension of a criminal, . concealment of material facts, and three counts of giving false . statements. She was found not guilty of three counts of perjury and one . count of giving a false statement. Jurors . got the case Thursday and deliberated all Friday before leaving without . a verdict. They returned for additional deliberations Monday and . delivered the verdict after more than three hours. Sneiderman's defense has said prosecutors had a weak case but were desperate to convict Sneiderman of something. Sneiderman's lover Hemy Neuman was . last year convicted of the murder of Rusty Sneiderman and sentenced to . life in prison. He told police an angel who looked like Olivia Newton John told him to do it. Guilty: Andrea Sneiderman, pictured in court Monday, was found guilty on . nine of 13 felony counts of lying to police and hindering the . investigation into the murder of her husband . Spared: Sneiderman had been facing murder charges, but those were dropped last month by the prosecution . The mother-of-two was initially accused of arranging her husband's murder but the charges were dropped last month. DeKalb County District Attorney Robert James cited his recent review of evidence the defense turned over as part of pre-trial discovery. Thomas Clegg, one of Sneiderman's lead attorneys, balked at the explanation. 'I believe they have known all along that they didn't have a murder case,' he said in open court. The judge granted James' request to drop the more serious charges before the start of jury selection and released Sneiderman from house arrest. Judge Gregory Adams set Sneiderman's sentencing for 9am Tuesday and said she had 30 days to file her notice of intent to appeal. Torn apart: Russell Sneiderman was murdered after dropping his children off at daycare . MyFox Atlanta reported . that jurors in the trial resumed their deliberations Monday morning . after taking a break over the weekend.

Miss Sneiderman showed . little emotion as she sat with her defense team, carefully writing down . the counts and the jury's findings. She was then led out of the . courtroom by deputies. Throughout . the trial, prosecutors played and replayed video and audio clips of . Sneiderman's interviews with police investigators and her testimony . during Neuman's trial. They contrasted that with witness testimony and documents that they said proved she had lied to police and the court.

They . also called experts to refute some of the documents and evidence . presented by the prosecution. During testimony earlier this month, Rusty's father Don . Sneiderman said his daughter-in-law called him and told him what . happened while she was on the way to the hospital. 'There are some calls you never forget,' he said. But Sneiderman herself testified at her lover's murder trial that she 'didn’t . know what happened to Rusty until I got to the emergency room. No one . told me what happened to Rusty', Fox Atlanta reported.

Sneiderman emerged during opening statements in her trial on charges of . lying under oath and hindering the investigation into her husband's . death. DeKalb County prosecutor Kellie Hill told the jury: 'The evidence will show a forbidden . romance that ends in murder, silence despite her suspicion, and lies to . conceal the truth from her family, from her friends, from the police and . from a jury.'

County prosecutor Kellie Hill told the jury that evidence in the case . will show that soon after Sneiderman took a job at General Electric, she . formed a friendship with Neuman that quickly blossomed into a romantic . relationship. But because she was married with young children, she felt conflicted about it and was hot and cold with Neuman, Hill said. Emails the state plans to present show 'she feels torn between her reality and her desires,' Hill said. Andrea . Sneiderman had willingly participated in a relationship with Neuman, . sharing deep personal secrets with him, sending him photos of her . children, and sharing kisses and other physical contact with him during . business trips, Hill said. But . she failed to tell police about her relationship with Neuman and failed . to tell them she suspected he might be involved, Hill said. 'If the police had known about the relationship, they would have known why someone wanted Rusty dead,' she said. Sneiderman also lied under oath . during Neuman's trial last year, denying the romantic relationship and . lying about when she found out her husband had been shot, Hill said. As . she was driving to the preschool after getting a call from an employee . there about an emergency, she called her father-in-law and told him his . son had been shot, even though no one had told her that yet, Hill said. Defense . attorney Tom Clegg told jurors that Sneiderman told police the day . after her husband's killing that Neuman had tried to break up her . family.

A schoolboy who raped a six-year-old girl twice has walked free from court despite telling a probation officer 'I don't care' when asked how his young victim felt following her ordeal. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, admitted forcing the girl to carry out a sex act on two occasions, Ipswich Youth Court heard. But during a meeting with a court official, who was compiling a pre-sentence report, the youth showed no remorse for his victim. No remorse: The 12-year-old boy walked free from Ipswich Youth Court, pictured, despite telling a probation officer 'I don't care how she feels' when asked about his victim . Prosecutor Simon Newell said the boy was asked what he felt about the impact of his crimes on his victim and replied: 'I don’t care how she feels.' District Judge Celia Dawson told him that she was not sending him to a secure youth offending unit because she did not want him to be in the company of ‘older and more sophisticated criminals’. The boy, who lives on the Suffolk and Norfolk border, was given a 12 month referral order and a 12 month restraining order banning him from contacting the victim or her family. He was also ordered to pay £300 in compensation to the girl, having admitted two counts of rape at an earlier hearing. The court heard that the boy’s parents took him to a police station when they heard about the sex attack allegations where he admitted what he had done straight away. 'I hope you are aware if you don’t change your attitude you may have very serious problems in the future.' District Judge Celia Dawson . Sentencing the boy, District Judge Dawson told him: 'I have read the report and of course it gives me some cause for concern because of your attitude to what you did. 'I hope in a way that is you trying to be brave and tough things out, and that when you start work with the Youth Offending Team you will begin to think about what you did, about how serious it was, and about how badly this has affected (the girl). 'I hope you are aware if you don’t change your attitude you may have very serious problems in the future. 'What you did was very, very wrong. Indeed you forced her to do something she did not want to do and didn’t understand.' A statement from the victim’s mother said the girl has been left frightened and very upset by what happened.

Claims: Former spin doctor Damian McBride leaves a Travelodge and heads to his news night interview . Damian McBride last night branded Labour critics of his sensational memoir as hypocrites. Gordon Brown’s former spin doctor said his accusers were ‘not entirely innocent themselves’ when it came to the party’s toxic culture of spin  and smear. And he said Labour’s leaders could have minimised the damage to their conference this week by responding better to the revelations in his book. The memoir, which is being serialised in the Daily Mail, has cast a long shadow over the Brighton gathering and lifted the lid on years of feuding, media manipulation and character assassination. Both Ed Miliband and Ed Balls, who were at the heart of the political operation run by Mr Brown, have scrambled to distance themselves from their former friend and colleague. Mr McBride told the Mail he was prepared to accept criticism of his misdeeds from new MPs such as Rachel Reeves and Chuka Umunna. But he added: ‘Other people were quite closely involved in these years – and are not entirely innocent themselves. It’s a bit hard to take. ‘Maybe it’s because some people have got old scores to settle that there’s a feeling that this is a chance to give me a kicking – and by extension give some old enemies a kicking.’ Mr McBride singled out Tony Blair’s former spin chief Alastair Campbell and shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander, whose allies he blames for leaking a damaging story that Mr Brown was snubbed five times by Barack Obama. Scroll down for video... Leadership: Ed Miliband and Ed Balls, pictured at their party conference in Brighton, have tried to distance themselves from their former colleague and friend since the revelations were published in McBride's memoirs . He . said he was surprised by the frenzy that greeted his revelations, and . risked further antagonising former colleagues  by criticising how they . have reacted to them. He . said the party should have adopted the same approach he ordered when . former Labour general secretary Peter Watt published a damaging book on . the eve of one of Mr Brown’s conferences. ‘The . line from day one should have been: “We’re not going to help Mr McBride . sell his book and we have far more important things to discuss”,’ he . said. ‘Why it wasn’t, I don’t know. They’re stoking it up . unnecessarily.’ He . attacked allies of Mr Miliband he believes were behind a lurid weekend . story saying he had once claimed to have had an alcohol-fuelled . one-night stand with a female minister. ‘All . I really made of that was “talk about holier than thou”. I’m not going . to complain about these things. 'But it’s interesting that the first . reaction of someone, somewhere, to my book was to try to do some . damaging story about my personal life,’ he said. Allegations: Mr McBride singled out Alastair Campbell and shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander, whose allies he blames for leaking a deeply story about how Mr Brown was snubbed when he requested a meeting with Barack Obama . Partnership: Ed Miliband congratulates Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls after his keynote speech to delegates while Mr McBride's allegations continue to cast a shadow over the party . He . repeated his warning to Mr Miliband about potentially damaging emails . the Labour leader is said to have sent to Derek Draper, a Labour . campaigner at the centre of the smear campaign against  senior Tories . that finally forced Mr McBride’s resignation in 2009. ‘Every time we think we’ve seen the last of the Draper emails, we see another one. I would be a little bit concerned,’ he said. Mr . McBride said he had not heard from Mr Brown, his former boss, since . extracts from his book began to be published. Yesterday, asked in New . York for his reaction, the former prime minister refused to comment. ‘He . will be both angry at some of the revelations and angry at the . assumption that there is guilt by association,’ Mr McBride said. 'I . regret that he will be feeling like that. But I don’t think there was a . way to tell my story without being open about this stuff. ‘Some . people said “Whatever you do, don’t own up to x, y, z”. But others said . if I didn’t admit the things I did, if I wasn’t honest about it, then . people would come out and destroy my credibility.’ Mr McBride . dismissed claims from Mr Campbell and others that his antics, and those . of Mr Brown’s other supporters, cost Labour the last general election. In . a separate interview for the BBC’s Newsnight programme, Mr McBride . warned that ‘any sense of disunity or disagreement between Mr Miliband . and Mr Balls – any repeat of the Blair-Brown feud – would be fatal to . Labour’s election chances’. ‘If anything, I hope my book will act as a . sobering reminder of those risks,’ he added. Mr . Campbell said: ‘A narrative was fed to the public, day in day out, that .

The victim of a savage dog attack condemned a magistrate who apologised to the pet’s owner as he reluctantly ordered its destruction. Christoph Egle had to have his face and arm rebuilt as the ferocious mastiff-staffy cross ‘tore chunks of meat’ from him. Surgeons reattached his thumb to his hand and the 56-year-old builder faces months before he can regain full use of it. Savaged: Christophe Egle, 56, shows the scars on his arm and face inflicted during a terrifying attack by a neighbour's dog . Owner Jordan Khan, 19, admitted failing to control his guard dog, called Gunner. But magistrate Rodger Livesey told him: 'It’s with a heavy heart that we have to agree to a destruction order. I know that he’s been a good friend to you and I’m sorry.' Furious Christoph said: 'Why are they apologising to him? It’s unbelievable - I almost lost my life. They need to focus on the real victim and think about what they’re saying. I thought I was doing to die and doctors have told me I’ll be scarred for life. 'In 18 months I still won’t be able to use my thumb, but Khan will have forgotten all about that dog. 'I can’t move my thumb and I’m exhausted all the time. 'I used to play piano and was in a band, but I can’t do that now. 'I’ll have to pay out for any further plastic surgery I need to have.' Mauled: The crazed mastiff-staffy cross clamped its jaws around the head of Christoph Egle during the ferocious attack in June . Surgery: Medics had to reattach parts of Christoph Egle's hand which was so badly injured during the dog attack in St Albans, Hertfordshire, in June . Mr Egle was attacked when he went to retrieve a set of his ladders from Khan’s house in St. Albans, Herts in June. He accused his neighbour of failing to ask permission to borrow them after he locked himself out of his flat. Gunner . mistook him for an intruder and knocked him to the ground and clamped . its jaws on Christoph’s head as he screamed for help. Pounced: The dog, called Gunner, similar to the one pictured, left, mistook Mr Egle for an intruder and launched a savage attack which left him needing extensive surgery, including stitched to his thumb, right . The attack was so vicious Khan and a friend struggled to pull the dog off before calling an ambulance. Christoph - whose wife Janet, 34, was pregnant at the time - was rushed to Watford General Hospital for emergency surgery. He later needed three operations to prevent permanent disfigurement. Mr . Egle told St. Albans Magistrates Court: 'I try not to think about the . events because it was the most traumatic moment of my life. All I . remember is the animal ripping chunks of meat from my body. 'I feel very strongly that this dog should be put down so that it can’t do this to anyone else.' Khan admitted allowing his pet to be dangerously out of control in a public place and causing injury. Mr Livesey, 69, imposed a four-week prison sentence, suspended for twelve months and ordered the destruction of the dog. Wounded: The savage mauling by his neighbour's dog left Christoph Egle with terrible injuries on his face, arm and leg which required emergency surgery . The . magistrate told Khan: 'To your credit you did your best to remove the . dog, you called the ambulance service and were cooperative with . assisting and you’ve pleaded guilty today. 'But . on the other hand we’ve looked at the facts and it was unfortunate that . the incident took place on someone else’s land and you were taking . someone else’s property.' Andrew Hobdell, defending, said: 'At the scene Mr Khan did as much as he could do to assist in removing the dog. 'He managed to get as much as he could do in first aid, and then called an ambulance.

""Time to introduce a £1,000 a year Dog-Owning Licence. Less dogs = less attacks on humans.- maggio, london, 23/9/2013 16:02"" I'm not sure why you have so many upvotes because that's a really stupid idea. Why punish everyone financially because of the 0.001% of owners who aren't fit to have an animal. The key here is in punishing the owners when their dog has attacked. If sentences were harsher then people would think a lot harder about the type of dog they bought and the amount of time they invested in it. For example if the law changed and the dog was treated as an extension of yourself, ie anything your dog does, be it GBH, murder or whatever, would then give you the same sentence as if you had actually done it yourself. This would act as a major deterrent without hitting people financially when most people and families love their dog and their dog loves them. Jane, . Ipswich, . 1 day ago .

The father of a four-year-old boy allegedly starved to death by his mother has told a court he contacted social services about his son but was told it was a 'private matter'. Aftab Khan told Bradford Crown Court he confronted Amanda Hutton about how she was looking after Hamzah Khan. But he said she told him to mind his own business and banned him from the house less than a year before the little boy died in December 2009. Aftab Khan (left) told Bradford Crown Court how he confronted Amanda Hutton (right) about how she was looking after Hamzah Khan . Mr Khan was giving evidence at the trial of Hutton, who is accused of the manslaughter of her son. The jury has been told Hamzah's mummified body was discovered in a cot in Hutton's Bradford home in September 2011. Mr Khan told the court how he had separated from Hutton after he was charged with assaulting her. He said he was initially stopped from visiting Hutton due to a court order but did start to go and see his son when they moved to a new home in Bradford in March 2009. Mr Khan told the jury his former partner was not looking after Hamzah properly. 'I said ""look at the state of him - you're not looking after him"" and she told me to get out,' he told the jury. The court has heard Hamzah Khan's mummified body was discovered in a cot in Hutton's Bradford home in September 2011 . The mechanic and taxi driver told the court that it was his concerns about his son that had led to the arguments resulting in his arrest in 2008 and eventual conviction for battery. He said: 'She wasn't bathing him. She wasn't changing him.' Mr Khan said he would only see Hutton feeding Hamzah milk. He said his former partner drank cider and vodka heavily, especially after the death of her mother. 'She'd be absolutely out of it,' he said. Hutton, who denies manslaughter, sat in the dock dressed in black, watching Mr Khan give his evidence. Mr Khan told the jury he contacted social services once about the condition of Hamzah but said he was ignored. Mr Khan was giving evidence at Bradford Crown Court (pictured) at the trial of Hutton, who is accused of the manslaughter of her son . The jury has heard how, when Mr Khan was arrested for attacking Hutton in 2008, he told police he was going to contact social services about his son. A senior police officer told the court there was no record he ever made the call. Yesterday, Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, asked Khan whether he did contact social services. He said: 'I remember ringing social services up. They said it was a private matter. 'Social services are never bothered about cases like this.' 'They weren't bothered. Social services are never bothered in cases like these. I'd given up at that time' - Aftab Khan . Pressed by Mr Greaney, he said: 'I clearly remember. There's no record of it. They weren't bothered, they weren't interested. I'd given up at that time.' Mr Greaney QC also asked Mr Khan about urging police to 'go and check' on Hamzah. 'Yes, so they could see the neglect for themselves,' he answered. Mr Greaney asked Mr Khan about a text message he sent to Hutton which read: . 'Don't worry it's not me who's going to land you in the s***, you're . going to do that yourself. You've turned into the biggest liar, stop . drinking.' The text also asked what Hamzah had 'had' and added: 'Think about what you're doing to everybody.' Mr Greaney asked him: 'What do you mean by ""had""?' Mr Khan answered: 'I meant what food, had he been fed properly?' Mr Khan rejected claims in court that he was a 'wife batterer'. Mr Khan said he was initially stopped from visiting Hutton (pictured) due to a court order but did start to go and see his son when they moved to a new home in Bradford in March 2009 . Stephen Meadowcroft QC, defending, asked him: 'You were a wife batterer and she was a battered wife, cowed by your violence.' Mr Khan said: 'If I was a wife batterer why am I not standing next to her (Hutton)?' Mr Meadowcroft replied: 'Perhaps you ought to be.' The defence barrister put it to Mr Khan that he had been violent towards his client throughout their 20-year relationship, but he denied this. 'I've come here to answer questions about my child,' he said. 'Everyone knows what happened. You've got damning evidence against Miss Hutton but you're still trying to point the finger at me. I'm not having it.' Mr Khan repeatedly insisted that he tried to alert police and social services to his son's plight but was not listened to. He said: 'A year down the line, what happened? A child died.' Mr Khan was asked again about the call he said he made to social services. He said: 'This country is run for women. A man's got no rights in this country.' Mr Meadowcroft told him: 'You were the father of the family. You were there. Had you actually thought that (Hamzah's neglect)? What did you do about it?' Mr Khan told the court: 'The police wouldn't believe me. No one would believe me. 'I know I made one phone call. If the police weren't going to believe me, who else is going to believe me? I gave up. 'The system failed my son. Did the school check up? Did social services check up? I lost my total confidence in the system.' Mr Khan said he even helped Hutton before the court case, giving her money to buy clothes for the trial. 'I've helped her a lot. If I was a violent man, I wouldn't have helped.' Mr Khan (pictured) rejected claims in court that he was a 'wife batterer' He told the court: 'She's done it all. Put me on one side. You've got so much evidence against her it's unbelievable.' Deepinder Kaur told the court Hamzah was small and did not eat very much in the months before his death. Miss Kaur, 24, a former girlfriend of Hutton's son Qaiser, 22, said the boy would eat half a cheese and onion pasty in the evening and half a banana in the morning. She said that during the day he would eat 'biscuits or whatever's lying around'. Miss Kaur said that despite being nearly four at the time, in February 2009, 'he looked like a baby' and would often wear a baby-gro. 'He was very light,' she said. 'He didn't weigh much.' Asked where Hamzah spent his days, Miss Kaur said he was either in front of the TV in the living room or locked in a bedroom with the light turned off. Asked whether Hutton explained why he was locked upstairs, she said: 'She said it was because he'd been naughty. But she didn't say exactly what he'd done.' Pc Maria Furness, of West Yorkshire Police, told the jury she attended Hutton's house to perform a welfare check but found Hamzah to be 'fed well, clean, healthy looking and there was an appropriate adult in the address'. The officer said that appropriate adult was Tariq, Hamzah's brother, who told her he was his uncle. Pc Furness said she was at the house for about 30 to 45 minutes when she made the visit about eight months before Hamzah's death. Hutton denies manslaughter. The case continues.

A British couple travelling home from France died in a crash when the husband suffered at heart attack while riding their motorcycle. Malcolm Hagan, 56, died instantly from the attack while Beverley, 53, was killed by the impact of the crash. The couple, from South Hylton, Sunderland, who 'fell in love at first sight,' were together for 37 years and had one daughter, Gemma Hagan-McGrandle, 32. Tragic: The couple were on their way home to South Hylton, Sunderland, from a motorbike event near Nancy, France. The crash happened shortly after their departure . Today, their family spoke of their heartbreak at the loss of the 'unique couple'. 'The only comfort that we can take from what happened is that they went quickly together,' said Malcolm’s sister Lynne Hagan, 59. 'There was no pain, no anguish, and that is what we are focusing on. 'Gemma was their only child and she has been amazingly strong in these difficult times. Now, we just want to protect her.' The keen bikers had been attending the annual Pan Gathering of The Northern Pan Riders, near Nancy in northern France, when they were killed. 'They were good friends to many,' said Lynne. 'Generous, kind and considerate. They will be missed.' Malcolm, a former squadron sergeant major, served in the Army for 25 years, including in Operation Desert Storm, in the Gulf War. 'The demands of military life place a strain on relationships and families,' said Lynne. 'Mal and Bev were blessed to have an enduring love. She was strong and caring.' Their time as a service couple inspired years of charity work, which saw the pair helping to raise tens of thousands of pounds for various causes, and taking part in Rides of Respect at Wootton Bassett. The couple died when returning home from the annual Pan Gathering of The Northern Pan Riders, near Nancy in eastern France, a meeting for bikers who ride Honda Pan European models, pictured . 'They were generous to many charities with their time and money,' Lynne said. 'They were an example to us all. 'They enjoyed dressing up for special charity events, even turning out as Father Christmas for Santa rides - such was Mal’s authenticity to the Santa persona that he started growing the beard in September. 'They attended the funerals of many fallen comrades, so a Just Giving page has been set up to raise money for Help for Heroes in their memory.' Scores of bikers and friends are expected to attend the funeral. Lynne said: 'We are expecting a huge turnout for both of them. They will be greatly missed.' Their joint funeral will be held on Thursday at Sunderland Crematorium with friends and fellow riders accompanying the hearses. In a break from tradition, Beverley will go first as 'she was the rock,' Lynne said. The Northern Pan Riders club posted a . message of condolence on its website saying both were 'enthusiastic . organisers and participants' in events at the club. 'Mal's razor sharp wit will leave many with humorous memories and Bev's caring and sharing will leave us with warm reflections.' The Foreign and Commonwealth Office confirmed the couple’s death.

The biggest union donor to Labour’s coffers declared last night ‘it’s our party’. Len McCluskey told a conference gathering in Brighton: ‘No one is pushing us out of our party. We are here this week to carry our voice into the political arena.’ His Unite union has given £8.4million since Ed Miliband became leader. Mr Miliband made a pitch to the Left at the weekend by promising a mansion tax, a higher minimum wage and monitoring of how many women appear on TV. Determined: Last night, Len McCluskey told a conference gathering in Brighton: ¿No one is pushing us out of our party. We are here this week to carry our voice into the political arena.¿ . And, asked when he would ‘bring back socialism’, he replied: ‘That’s what we are doing. It is about fighting the battle for economic equality, for social equality and for gender equality too. ‘That is a battle that is not yet won in our country.’ Mr Miliband said Labour would scrap the Tories’ free schools policy and force primaries to stay open for longer to offer ‘wraparound’ childcare from 8am to 6pm. However, his remarks did not appear to appease Labour’s union backers, who have clashed with him over his plans to reform their relationship with the party. ‘We are certainly not going to accept any advice on democracy and transparency from the people who brought us the cash for honours scandals,’ said GMB boss Paul Kenny. Promises: Mr Miliband made a pitch to the Left at the weekend by promising a mansion tax, a higher minimum wage and monitoring of how many women appear on TV . At a fringe event, Mr McCluskey suggested Labour must show it is following the unions’ agenda or his union would pull its support, saying: ‘My challenge to Ed Miliband is to make it clear that the Labour Party is the party of working people, is the party of organised labour. ‘Labour has no god-given right to exist – it can only exist if it speaks for ordinary working people. Demonstrate that you’re on our side.’ The Unite leader called on anti-austerity campaigners to rise up, drawing a bizarre parallel with the Arab Spring, which he said showed ‘people power can bring down dictators’. He also condemned ‘evil’ capitalism’ and Labour for backing the principle of flexible markets. Mr Kenny, meanwhile, said the union link would not be ‘washed away for an electoral gimmick’. He insisted that a dilution of  the unions’ collective voice in the Labour Party was simply ‘not on the agenda’. Mr Miliband is facing a further potential blow from the unions today when Unison attempts to overturn his policy on public sector pay. Mr Miliband has said a Labour government would keep the current cap in place. But Unison will attempt to reverse this today by forcing a conference vote on the issue, which looks likely to end in defeat for the leadership. Mr Miliband wants union members to opt into party membership rather than be automatically affiliated. Debate: GMB boss Paul Kenny has clashed with Mr Miliband over his attempts to appease Labour's union backers . But Mr Kenny, who announced plans this month to slash funding to Labour by £1million a year in protest at the reforms, said: ‘We can expand ad infinitum the number of people we bring into the tent, but if what they say is ignored, as has been the case in the past, in favour of dinner party babble, then why bother?’ Mr Kenny, who received a standing ovation from union leaders inside the hall, urged Mr Miliband to focus on bread-and-butter issues such as jobs and living standards, saying the public ‘do not give a fig’ about party funding. A special conference will be held next March on whether the planned reforms will be accepted. Share what you think . The comments below have not been moderated. petri, .

An Oscar-winning composer's son was sentenced Monday to 25 years to life in prison after being convicted of killing his fashion designer girlfriend in a swank hotel room. Nicholas Brooks, 27, was convicted in July of murdering 33-year-old Sylvie Cachay in December 2010. He was arrested while his father, Joseph Brooks, who wrote the 1970s touchstone torch song 'You Light Up My Life,' was himself facing criminal charges of mistreating women: allegations of raping or molesting 13 would-be actresses. The younger Brooks and Cachay had a tumultuous six-month relationship, bolstered by obvious affection and mutual attraction but hampered by differences in age, attitude and ambition. Prosecutors said he strangled her because she was dumping him. Nicholas Brooks, 26, was charged with murder after his girlfriend, Sylvie Cachay, was discovered dead at the Soho House in NYC in 2010. He is pictured here on June 11. Jittery: Nicholas Brooks, pictured at his 2010 . arraignment, was seen on SoHo House's CCTV footage pacing barefoot outside the room and biting his nails around the time Sylvie Cachay is believed to have been killed . 'The loss of Sylvie is the most . devastating thing that has ever occurred in my life,' Brooks told a . court Tuesday. 'I think about her every day, and it breaks my heart. I . loved her very much, and not a moment goes by where I do not miss her.' But . Cachay's relatives lashed out at Brooks as a craven killer — 'a . cowardly liar, a parasite to our society, an abuser of women and a . repulsive murderer,' in the words of one of Cachay's brothers, Patrick . Orlando. And Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Bonnie Wittner . lambasted him as a young man who squandered his education and his . privilege. Brooks looked down and seemed to give a slight shrug as Wittner announced he was getting the maximum sentence. When . the couple met, Brooks was a college dropout living largely off a trust . fund from his father. The son had a penchant for hiring escorts and . smoking marijuana, prosecutors said.

Death chamber: The bath tub Sylvie's half-naked body was found submerged in at the Soho House hotel .

The duo checked into the Soho House hotel after a small fire in Cachay's apartment. They are seen on a surveillance camera in the hotel's hallway wobbling into their room. Brooks comes and goes several times, at one point appearing frantic, before leaving for hours. Cachay's partially clothed body was discovered in an overflowing bathtub after it began leaking into the room below. Medical examiners later ruled that she had been forcibly drowned and strangled. 'Couples break up every day without one ending up in a gurney inside the coroner's office. He just had to walk away. That's all he had to do,' Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Joel Seidemann said. Nicholas Brooks is pictured in 2010 as he was being arrested for killing his girlfriend .

The number of new HIV infections has plummeted by a third since 2001 and more than halved among children, the United Nations has said. Globally, 2.3 million people contracted the AIDS virus last year - down 33 per cent from 2001, while 260,000 children became infected - 52 per cent less than in 2001. ‘The annual number of new HIV infections continues to decline with especially sharp reductions in the number of children newly infected with HIV,’ said UNAIDS executive director Michel Sidibe. The number of new HIV infections has plummeted by a third since 2001 and more than halved among children. UNAIDS executive director, Michel Sidibe (pictured), has put this down to the increasing availability of antiretroviral drugs . Hailing progress in distributing antiretroviral drugs that prevent the transmission of the virus from pregnant women to their unborn children, the UN body said it may be possible to slash new infections among children by 90 per cent in the next two years. In its annual report on the state of the global pandemic, the agency said the drugs had prevented more than 670,000 children contracting the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which causes AIDS between 2009 and 2012 alone. In sub-Saharan Africa - home to 90 per cent of the world's 3.3 million infected children - the decline was particularly striking. In Ghana, for instance, 90 per cent of pregnant, HIV-positive women had access to antiretroviral treatment last year, up from just 32 per cent three years earlier. As a result, the likelihood of women in the country infecting their unborn children dropped from 31 per cent in 2009 to just nine per cent last year, said UNAIDS. Increased access to the drug ‘cocktail’ which curtails HIV transmission but does not cure it, has helped reduce the number of AIDS-related deaths among all age groups by 30 per cent since they peaked in 2005, the report said. Globally, 2.3 million people contracted the AIDS virus (pictured) last year - down 33 per cent from 2001, while 260,000 children became infected - 52 per cent less than in 2001 . In a foreword to the 269-page report, Mr Sidibe hailed ‘continued progress towards the global vision of zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths’. Last year, 1.6 million people died AIDS-related deaths, down from 1.8 million in 2011 and 2.3 million in 2005. The report showed that 9.7 million people in low and middle-income countries, the bulk of those infected, had access to HIV drugs last year, compared to only 1.3 million seven years earlier. While the hike is impressive, it falls short of a UN target announced two years ago to reach 15 million people by 2015. The drugs prevented more than 670,000 children contracting HIV between 2009 and 2012 . And it represents only 34 per cent of the 28.3 million people who need the drugs, under new guidelines released by the World Health Organisation in June. The increased access to treatment also means that more people are living with HIV, according to UNAIDS. Some 35.3 million people were living with the virus last year -- about 70 per cent of them in sub-Saharan Africa - up from 30 million in 2001. Mr Sidibe insisted the 2015 target for global access to antiretrovirals remained in sight, but stressed the world must ‘have the vision and commitment to ensure no one is left behind’. Obviously, this will put a strain on world purse strings. UNAIDS said international donor contributions to combating HIV had remained flat since the global financial crisis began in 2008, and individual countries were increasingly picking up the tab to beat HIV at home. Last year, nations accounted for 53 per cent of the $18.9 billion set aside to fight the virus. The UN has set a target of $22-24 billion by 2015. Earlier this year, Mr Sidibe insisted the investment would pay off, pointing out that ‘fewer deaths, less sickness’ takes a burden off the healthcare system, allowing HIV-positive people to work and contribute to the economy for longer. ‘If we do not pay now, we will pay later, we'll pay forever,’ he said.

This is encouraging news, but there is a downside as it leads to public complacency, if they think there is less likelihood of catching HIV or that modern drugs will control it.

Scroll down for video . Flying high: The P12 machine can reach a height of up to 8,000ft and travel at 45mph. It has been designed to be more maneuverable than its predecessor due and could be used as a first response vehicle . New Zealander Glenn Martin has created extraordinary piece of machinery in which a 'pilot' stands on a platform at the front, using a console to control two vertical engines that mimic the behaviour of the jet engines. The P11 model is pictured . The firm is is currently focused on rolling the jetpack out as a first responder vehicle . While the company plans on launching the . jetpack as a recreational vehice in the future, it is currently focused . on rolling it out as a first responder vehicle for daring rescues and an . unmanned air vehicle for heavy lifting. The vehicle was inspired by childhood TV . shows such as Thunderbirds and Lost in Space, according to  New . Zealander Glenn Martin, who  began working in his Christchurch garage 30 . years ago on a device which he hoped would one day see a man speeding . through the air under his own power. It is expected the jetpack will go on sale for commercial use for the price of a British luxury car - £90,000 - while a specially-fitted unit, with communications equipment for military use demands an asking price of £127,000. The company recently modified its latest P12 prototype to  move the ducts lower and add a balance shaft to reduce vibration from the 200 hp engine. It said the P12 will be the basis for its pre-production model. Martin Aircraft Company’s CEO, Peter Coker, said that the P12 prototype was a 'huge step up' from the previous prototype.

'The jetpack continues to attract interest from potential customers and investors worldwide,' said Mr Coker. 'We are focussing initially on developing the jetpack for use as a first responder vehicle and heavy lift unmanned air vehicle'. The company is also developing a jetpack simulator that will be available for sale in the next few months. Bird's eye view: The futuristic jetpack jet engines can reach a height of up to 8,000ft and travel at 45mph . It is expected the jetpack will go on sale for commercial use for the price of a British luxury car - £90,000 - while a specially-fitted unit, with communications equipment for military use demands an asking price of £127,000 . The jetpack is officially registered as a 'Class One Microlight', standing 2.20m and with a width 2.14m. Its engines are 200hp and there is a 45litre fuel capacity. It can cover a distance of 18 miles for a period of around 30 minutes and runs on normal car petrol and two stroke oil. Its noise is the limit of a car - 90 decibels.Take off weight: 725lb. Pilot visibility: To be flown only by daylight and visually. Can be flown in light rain. The New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority confirmed that the jetpack had been issued with an experimental flight permit for development test flying, meaning that a person can be used to fly the device. A mixture of manned and unmanned test flights have been carried out, whereas previously the company used a dummy at the controls, while technicians on the ground have guided the jetpack by remote control. As part of the testing programme, engineers at the firm have made modifications to the machine's V4 engine to make it more durable and decrease the maintenance requirements. They hope to have made the final adjustments to the engine by the end of this year. Already some 30 budding James Bonds have put down deposits on the futuristic personal transport, inspired by the words of test pilot James Bowker who has flown the jetpack. 'It's a mixture of scary and just awesome,' said Mr Bowker after the indoor flight. 'Flying . it remotely means you can see the aircraft and so . you can see everything that happens, but when you're actually in it, . it's all behind you and you just get lifted off the ground. It's just . awesome.' He said there was still a 'little bit more work to do' before the jetpack is ready to be sold but there had been 'tremendous interest' from around the world. 'It's a really exciting time for us,' said Mr Peter Coker chief executive of Martin Aircraft whose company is working in partnership with Emirates to put the final touches to the futuristic machine. 'We have had manned flights on lots of the prototypes in varying forms but this is the first one that is totally manoeuvrable.' Some may think that the invention is just a toy for the wealthy but the machine could have life-saving implications. One idea is to mount the jetpack on the back of a fire engine so it could be used by a crew member to scout hazardous areas before firefighters moved in to quell the flames . He added that he was convinced that the jetpack is going to change the whole concept of light aircraft. 'This is the motorbike of the sky,' he said. He conceded that while the machine might seem like a toy for the wealthy as they zap from town house to country retreat, bosses at Martin believed their creation could have life-saving implications . One idea, said Mr Coker, was to mount the jetpack on the back of a fire engine so it could be used by a crew member to scout hazardous areas before firefighters moved in to quell the flames.

For most people, the thought of a bonus often goes hand in hand with dreams of acquiring the latest designer handbag or gadget. But new research suggests that giving it all away could in fact give you the biggest buzz of all. Scientists believe that individuals gain happiness and productivity at work as well as better team performance by sharing their bonus money. A series of studies found providing employees with a bonus to spend on charities or their co-workers also led to uplifted team sales. Researchers at Duke University believe individuals gain happiness and productivity at work as well as better team performance by sharing their work bonus . The research was conducted by Fuqua School of Business at Duke University and published in the PLOS ONE journal. In three studies where some employees at an Australian bank were given a $25 or $50 voucher to donate to charity on behalf of their company, employees who donated the larger amount . to charity reported enhanced happiness and job satisfaction, compared to . those who did not donate to charity or donated the smaller amount. In subsequent experiments, the researchers measured the performance of 11 sports teams in Canada and 14 pharmaceutical sales teams in Belgium after receiving bonuses. A third of each team was selected to receive $20 to spend either on themselves or on their teammates. In both experiments, the researchers found that when participants spent their bonuses on teammates, the whole team performed significantly better than when individuals spent their bonuses on themselves.

In the case of pharmaceutical sales, for every $10 given to a team member to spend on their colleagues, the team received $52 in sales. Lalin Anik from the university said: 'The results across three studies suggest that a minor adjustment to employee bonuses - shifting the focus from the self to others - can create more altruistic, satisfying, and productive workplace.' Recent research by the university into the relationship between job satisfaction and money found most people would pick a boring job over a stimulating one if they do not think they are being paid enough for the extra efforts, even if they claim otherwise. Marketing professor Peter Ubel explored the idea of 'effort aversion' or why people choose to put less effort into a task even if they do not again as much satisfaction from it. Another study by Duke University found most people would pick a boring job over a stimulating one if they do not think they are being paid enough for their extra efforts . He said:'We found even when an effortful job would be more interesting and . enjoyable than one requiring less effort, people might price themselves . out of the job market because they feel their effort needs to be . rewarded.' Together with researchers from Stirling University, Professor Ubel conducted studies that showed how wages impact a job seeker's willingness to take on more challenges. In the first experiment they asked 144 people which job they would choose from two on offer at a cultural festival. The usher role required considerably more effort than the monitor role. While 82 per cent of people preferred the job description of the usher role, only 36 per cent would take the job if it payed more than the less demanding monitor position. Share what you think .

From a remarkable meteor shower to stunning pictures of the swirling gases and galaxies in deep space, these are just a few of the phenomenal images entered into this year's Astronomy Photographer of the Year competition. Over a thousand amateur and professional photographers from around the world entered the competition, but Australian Mark Gee won the top prize for his beautiful image of the sky over the southern hemisphere, decorated with a number of astronomical highlights. The shot shows central regions of the Milky Way Galaxy - over 26,000 light years away - appearing as a tangle of dust and stars, lit up by a lighthouse on the Cape Palliser, New Zealand, shining out to sea. Winning shot: Mark Gee's image of the Milky Way came first in the Earth and Space Category as well as being voted overall winner . Stunning: Fredrik Broms from Norway was voted runner-up for this beautiful picture of the Aurora Borealis . Night sky: Fredrik Broms was also highly commended in the category for this image of the Comet Panstarrs over the mountains in his native Norway . Extraordinary: American David Kingham's image of a Perseid Meteor Shower over a mountain range was also highly commended . In the top left corner of the picture are two Magellanic Clouds, or small satellite galaxies in orbit around the Milky Way, which look like two round smudges in Mr Gee's image. Framing the photograph is the rugged landscape of the cape, which looks almost like the surface of a distant planet in itself. Mr Gee, who won £1,500 for his incredible picture, impressed the judges with the . depth and clarity of his winning shot. Judge and Royal . Observatory Public Astronomer, Dr. Marek Kukula said: 'I love the . tranquil combination of sea and sky in this beautiful image, along with . the comforting human element of the cliff-top lighthouse. Surreal: Spaniard Dani Caxete's image shows a quadruple lunar halo illuminating the landscape below . Far away: An image of the Celestial Impasto, a star formation composed off dust and gas, taken by American Adam Block . Deep space: Ivan Eder, from Hungary, took this wonderful shot of M81 and M82 galaxies - twelve million light years from Earth . Dust cloud: The Rho Ophiuchi and Antares Nebulae cloud complex - a dark nebula of gas - taken by Tom O'Donoghue . 'This view from . the shores of New Zealand makes me think of the long voyages the . Maori's ancestors made into unchartered oceans, guided by the stars. We're in a similar situation today, as we set out to explore the . Universe.' Mr Gee was crowned both overall winner and winner of the Earth and Space category. There were six other categories, including Deep Space, Our Solar System, People and Space, Robotic Scope Image of the Year, Young Astronomy Photographer of the Year and the Sir Patrick Moore prize for Best Newcomer. Runner-up in the Earth and Space category was a striking vision of a green Aurora Borealis captured by Fredrik Broms from Norway. Cluster: Omega Centauri - a spherical cloud containing several million stars taken by Ignacio Diaz Bobillo from Argentina . Haunting: A Corona Composite - or eclipse of the sun - taken in 2012 in Australia by Man-To Hui . Spectacular: Winning the Sir Partick Moore prize for Best Newcomer was Sam Cornwell for his image of the transit of Venus . The beautiful image clearly shows the shapes and forms of the Aurora Borealis as they are moulded by the Earth’s complex magnetic field above Grøtfjord in Norway. The photographer was also highly commended for his image of Comet Panstarrs over Norway's snow-topped mountains. A breath-taking total eclipse of the Sun, sometimes called a ‘cosmic coincidence’ due to the similar apparent sizes of the Sun and Moon, taken by Man-To Hui from China won the Our Solar System category. Adam Block won the Deep Space category for his image of star-formation Celestial Impasto with Ireland's Tom O'Donoghue winning runner up for his picture of gas and dust cloud complex Rho Ophiuchi and Antares Nebulae, appearing like spots of ink floating through water. Briton Sam Cornwell took first place in the newly renamed Sir Patrick Moor prize for Best Newcomer for his ghostly, visceral depiction of the 2012 Transit of Venus - which will not take place again until 2117. Double: Overall winner Mark Gee also won the People and Space Category for this image of a group of individuals silhouetted against the moon . Alight: Jia Hao's 'Ring of Fire Sequence' showing an 'annular eclipse' in which a ring of the sun remains visible . Teenager Jacob Marchio from the USA impressed the judges with two images. The first was a portrait of a waxing crescent Moon and the second a moody picture of the Milky Way Galaxy rendered with a dusky brown colour palette, which won the 14-year-old the accolade of Young Astronomy Photographer of the Year. From today, the best of these exceptional photographs will be showcased in a free . exhibition in the Royal Observatory’s Astronomy Centre. BBC Sky at Night Magazine’s Editor Chris Bramley, who is a judge for the competition, said of this year’s contest: 'With more entries than ever, and so many displaying superb compositions and a spectacular eye for detail, the judges faced a real challenge this year.

"By . Ryan Gorman . PUBLISHED: . 00:55 EST, 24 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:02 EST, 24 September 2013 . Two known gang members have been arrested for the shooting of 13 people at a Chicago, IL., basketball court Thursday night. Bryon Champ, 21, and Kewane Gatewood, 20, both of Chicago, have been charged with three counts each of attempted murder and aggravated battery with a firearm, officials said. Neither is suspected of pulling the trigger, but they are believed to have had significant roles in the shooting spree that shocked a city hardened by decades of senseless shootings. Scroll down for video . Known gang banger: Byron Champ is a known gang member with a previous felony weapons conviction . Mr Gatewood is believed by officials to have procured the assault rifle used in the shooting. Mr Champ is said by officials to have given the firearm to the shooter right before that person turned a basketball game into a war zone. A convicted felon found guilty of unlawful use of a weapon last summer, Mr Champ is ‘a documented gang member,’ officials said. He served no time in jail and instead went through a short stint in boot camp before being sent back out onto the streets. ‘Not only do we believe a military-grade weapon was used in this shooting, but one of the offenders charged tonight was convicted of Aggravated Unlawful Use of a Weapon/Possession of a firearm by a Felon little more than a year ago,’ Mr McCarthy said. ‘That is unacceptable. To truly address violence for the long-term we need state and federal laws that keep illegal guns out of our communities and provide real punishment for the criminals who use them,’ the irate superintendent added. War zone: Police investigate the scene Thursday in Cornell Square Park on the Southside where 13 people including a three-year-old child were shot . Believed to be retaliation for a previous gang shooting weeks earlier, according to WLS, a three-year-old boy was among 13 people shot while watching a basketball game in a dispute involving drugs and territory. Investigators are still questioning many people and plan to announce more arrests in the coming days, reports said. A press conference is scheduled for Tuesday morning, officials said. ‘These charges are just the beginning, and this investigation remains ongoing at this time,’ police superintendent Garry McCarthy said. Senseless violence: Deonta Howard, a 3-year-old boy affectionately called Tay Man by his family, had a bullet travel through his ear and exit his mouth in the mass shooting . Despite what appears to be out of control gun violence and almost daily reports of shooting incidents, city officials downplayed the need for assistance from the National Guard, and even said crime is down. ‘The National Guard is not a policing force,’ Mr McCarthy told NBC Chicago Monday shortly after swearing in 125 new police cadets, adding that ‘n comparison of where we are in comparison to where we were last year, in 2011, and compared to the 90s – let’s stop the hysteria.’ 25 people were shot over the weekend, five fatally.

The gallantry medal awarded to a bomb disposal novice blown up during the first weeks of the Blitz has sold at auction for £74,500. Ordinary Seaman Bennett Southwell had come to London to volunteer in a bomb disposal unit, but was tragically killed just a few weeks into the job. He was passing tools to this commanding officer Sub-lieutenant Jack Easton when he accidentally activated the bomb, giving them both 12 seconds to escape the explosion. Heroic: Ordinary Seaman Bennett Southwell (left) was killed trying to defuse a Nazi bomb, for which he was awarded the George Cross (right) Sale: OS Southwell's George Cross (left) sold for £74,500. His 1939-1945 War Medal (right) also sold in the same lot. While Sub-lieutenant Easton was able . to get behind a nearby bomb shelter, OS Southwell was caught up in the . blast and died immediately. He was awarded the George Cross, the nation's second-highest award for gallantry, just three months later. The original was sadly stolen in 1945, but the replacement medal had stayed in the family until it was sold by relatives at Dix Noonan Webb in London. David Erskine-Hill, of London . auctioneers Dix Noonan Webb, said: 'Direct wartime awards of the George . Cross are extremely rare, and few of them more evocative or poignant . than the example to Southwell Bennett. 'His . tragic death might normally have passed with no further comment beyond . the bland statement that announced the award of his decoration in the . London Gazette. 'Unusually, . however, his officer, though seriously injured, survived the incident, . as a result of which the full story behind Bennett’s gallantry later . emerged.' Careful: A bomb disposal officer handles the fuse of an unexploded bomb . Devastation: The Blitz ravaged London and tore huge holes in the streets, such as this one seen in front of the Royal Exchange . The bomb disposal units of the Second World War saved countless lives, and allowed Britain's war effort to continue unhindered. Their exploits were later commemorated in a 1970s TV series called Danger UXB - a reference to the warning signs which coated London to warn passers-by away from the bombs. The bomb which killed OS Southwell had . landed in the East End of London in the first weeks of the Blitz, when . Hitler turned his attention from British airfields to the capital. After . the parachute mine buried in a house in London’s East End began . whirring, he and Sub Lieutenant Jack Easton had 12 seconds to get clear . of it. The senior officer managed to dive behind a nearby surface air raid shelter and, despite being buried by rubble, survived. Deadly work: The Bomb Disposal units working in the Blitz put themselves at huge risk, as shown in this scene from 1970s series Danger UXB . OS Southwell, who only joined the bomb disposal team days before, ran down the street and was struck by flying debris and died instantly. He was posthumously awarded the George Cross which his relatives have now sold at auction for 74,500 pounds. OS Southwell, from Rotherham, South Yorks, was a married father of one when he was called up for the war in July 1940. He volunteered for mine and bomb disposal in September 1940 and died on October 17. Sub Lt Easton later wrote of how the two men were called to Hoxton in the East End to a UXB that hung suspended from a ceiling of a house just six inches from the floor. He said: 'I called my Rating (Southwell) into the hallway and explained the position. He would remain in the passage and pass me whatever tools I required. War effort: Bomb disposal officers stopped Britain coming to a standstill during German air raids . 'I had been working to detach the keep ring for about a minute when the bomb slipped in front of me. I heard the whirr of the bomb mechanism. Unless I got clear I had exactly 12 seconds to live. 'I pulled open the door against the weight of planks and I ran. I was through the hall in two leaps. 'I saw my Rating running down the street to what he, poor devil, thought was safety. 'I had no time to use distance for safety and ran across the roadway to a surface air raid shelter opposite. I flung myself on its far side, its bulk between me and the house.' Sub Lt Easton was pulled out from underneath the demolished shelter unconscious and with a broken back. He added: 'My Rating was killed. He was beheaded by the blast. The mine destroyed six streets and it was six weeks before his body was found among the rubble. 'He was a brave man and left behind a brave widow. I saw her receive her husband’s decoration from His Majesty the King.' The George Cross that sold was actually an official replacement after the original was stolen in 1945. OS Southwell’s War Medal 1939-45 also sold alongside it. Throughout the six years of the Second World War, the men and women of Bomb Disposal faced the continuous challenge of falling bombs - many of which were designed not to explode straight away in order to create more fear and devastation. When air raids over Britain began, the Army had very little idea of how to defuse the devices, but quickly developed tools and methods to make the explosives safe. Bombs were actually less deadly than expected - early estimates said the Blitz would kill almost 2million people, rather than the 55,000 it did - but the consequences were still devastating. In saving thousands of civilian lives, 750 of their own number were killed, more than half as many again as the tally of British aircrew who died during the Battle of Britain. Vital work: Bomb disposal experts tentatively lift a bomb out of the ground . Once air raids started against Britain in earnest, Churchill personally ordered that Bomb Disposal be given all the resources they needed to carry out their 'highly dangerous' work. By the time the Blitz ended in mid-1941, more than 40,000 civilians had been killed, half of them in London. More than 190,000 bombs had fallen, 20,000 of them UXBs. When peace was declared in May 1945, the men of Bomb Disposal had defused about 40,000 high explosive bombs, together with some 5,700 butterfly bombs and another 6,900 anti-aircraft shells and incendiaries. But their work was far from over. Between 1950 and 1958, another 140 UXBs were disposed of and 150 others discovered. The clear-up continues even today, with bombs regularly found on building sites.

If you thought that rendering unexploded German bombs safe was dead easy, a simple matter of removing the fuze from it, you'd be completely wrong. What most people don't know is that quite a few German bomb fuzes had integrated booby-trap mechanisms inside them. These were highly sensitive and would automatically trigger detonation if the bomb was moved even slightly, or if someone tried to remove the fuze from the bomb in an attempt to make it safe. In short, these bombs were specifically designed to kill the very men who were tasked with rendering them safe. It took great courage to kneel down next to an unexploded bomb knowing that it had been fitted with an anti-handling device that had been put there in the hope of blowing you to shreds. Some bombs had 2 fuzes fitted. One could be a booby-trap fuze and the other might be a clock-work delay, ticking away the seconds until detonation in the next 12 hours or 12 minutes. Very scary for the men who had to render them safe! The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.

Supermarkets Asda and Tesco have provided some autumn cheer for motorists by reducing their fuel prices. First, Asda announced that from today it would be knocking 2p a litre off the price of its petrol and 1p a litre off diesel. Then Tesco said it would be reducing its petrol 'by up to 2p per litre' and cutting its diesel by 1p a litre - also from today. Morrisons also said it would reduce prices, but would not specify by how much. Cuts in the price of petrol by major supermarket chains have been welcomed by the RAC . Asda said its reductions would mean no one will pay more than 131.7p a litre for its petrol, with diesel coming down to 137.7p a litre. The reductions follow a 2p cut in petrol and a 1p cut in diesel announced by Asda last week. The cuts were welcomed by the RAC and the AA. Pete Williams, the RAC's head of external affairs, said: 'This is exactly the action we wanted to see as a result of the drop in wholesale prices that has taken place over the past couple of weeks. 'We are now looking for other retailers to follow suit so that motorists benefit wherever they buy their fuel and we expect this to happen over the next few days.' The price of Brent North Sea oil has dropped following easing tensions in the Middle East sparked by Russian and US negotiations over Syria . He went on: 'Now more than ever, motorists are struggling to make ends meet on a daily basis due to the cost of running a car so every reduction in price at the pump makes a big difference. 'Current analysis of wholesale prices indicates there is still scope for retailers to pass on reductions of at least 5p a litre in petrol and 2p a litre in diesel over the next two weeks.' Petrol prices peaked this year at 140p on march 4, but the price of Brent North Sea oil has dropped following easing tensions in the Middle East sparked by Russian and US negotiations over Syria. Andy Peake, Asda's petrol trading director, said: 'Our national price cap on fuel benefits everyone across the country, meaning that no one filling up at Asda is forced to pay a premium for their fuel because of where they live.'

We are all selective in what prices we pay for food, clothes, holidays etc..but yet 90% of people just fuel up at the nearest station without even checking the prices!..no wonder supermarkets can charge the same as teh local shell garage.....people are dumb enough to use the supermarkets!....If supermarkets want MY business then they BETTER be cheaper!

Faithful fans thinking of copying Cheryl Cole's rose bottom tattoo should bear in mind that it could cost a down payment on small property to have it removed. Were you to change your mind about the design, ridding yourself of the giant inking could set you back £12,000 and 20 hours of laser removal sessions according to new research. A clinic search engine analysed the body art of 10 of the most tattooed celebrities and worked out how much it would cost to have it all removed. Cheryl Cole's giant inking would cost her - and anyone who wanted to copy her - £12,000 to remove . Cheryl Cole showed off her rose design at a Girls Aloud concert in February this year . The research shows that, should they ever regret their decision to go under the needle, these celebrities could end up paying tens of thousands of pounds to be tattoo free. Top of the league table of inked-up celebrities is American rapper Lil Wayne, who would need more than 500 sessions totaling 173 hours with a tattoo-removal specialist to erase all his artwork - at a hefty cost of almost £105,000. That's enough to buy a top-of-the-range Porsche or double the average deposit on a property put down by a first-time buyer in the UK last year. David Beckham's body is not just a temple, it is also adorned with tattoos from top to bottom, meaning a staggering bill of almost £40,000 - and the equivalent of 48 football matches in time under the needle - to be tattoo free again. David Beckham, pictured here in an ad for H&M, would have to play 48 football matches to afford removal . One Direction star Harry Styles may be just 19-years-old, but he's already an avid lover of body art. The cost to have them all removed would total almost £11,000. While the colossal cost may not be eye-watering for celebrities, for the millions of Britons who have tattoos wiping the slate clean is likely to put a strain on their finances, and in many cases may be unaffordable. Figures reveal there has been a 68 per cent increase in the number of people enquiring about tattoo removal in the past 12 months alone, with the cost of removing a small, black and white tattoo starting at £400. That fits with research showing that significant numbers of people end up regretting their tattoos. A recent poll by Harris Research showed that almost a fifth (19 per cent) of Britons with tattoos regretted having them done. Harry Styles showed off his tattooed body as he holidayed in the Caribbean in January . 17 BLACK: A reference to James Bond's lucky gambling number located on his left collarbone. CRUCIFIXES: Below '17 Black' are two crosses with the letters 'M' and 'K' under each. SWALLOWS: Two birds fly towards each other on the singer's chest. GEMMA: Written in Hebrew, refers to his sister's name with 'Can I cry?' inked . beneath. CITIES: 'LA', 'NY' and 'LDN' refer to the places where One Direction have performed. LOVEHEART: In pure black it sits on the front of his upper left arm. WARSHIP: Lord Nelson's HMS Victory inked on the side of his upper arm. BIRDCAGE: A traditional image sits under Harry's left arm, over his ribcage. THEATRE MASKS: Comedy and tragedy faces are inked below the birdcage. SMCL: Next to the theatre masks, according to fans the letters stand for 'Smile More, Cry Later'. STAR: The singer's first tattoo can be found on the inside of his left arm, towards the armpit. THINGS I CAN: Written on his right arm. THINGS I CAN'T: Written on left arm. MIGHT AS WELL: Inked above his left pelvic bone. PADLOCK: Sits on left wrist with the phrase, 'I can't change'. 99p: On left wrist with a shamrock leaf, a key and the Aquarius symbol. SCREW: All of One Direction have this design on their ankles .

'People decide to have tattoos removed for a number of reasons. Maybe they are starting a new job where visible tattoos would be inappropriate, or perhaps they had a tattoo with a partner and are no longer with that person,' says a spokesperson for Whatclinic.com, who commissioned the research. 'It could simply be that they had the tattoos when they were in their teens or early 20s and now they are older they have decided they would like to be tattoo free. 'Although having a tattoo removed is the last thing anyone will be thinking about when they actually get one, it is worth asking the tattooist about factors that would make removal more difficult like colour, position and size. That way, if they ever decide in the future that they want to have any tattoos removed, the process should be easier and less expensive.' Share what you think .

Just 24 hours earlier, she had rallied the faithful by proclaiming she would be 'more than a dress' in the battle for Number 10. But today Justine Miliband laid aside the austere black frock she picked for her address to the Labour party conference and slipped into something a little more feminine for husband Ed's keynote speech. The outfit, a £245 navy jacquard design by LK Bennett, exuded grown-up sophistication. It was a fitting choice for a high-flying barrister who until recently has been one of Britain’s more reticent political wives. Justine Miliband chose an eye-catching LK Bennett dress to watch her husband deliver his keynote speech in Brighton on Tuesday . On Monday the Labour wife claimed that she was more than just a dress as she spoke to Young Labour delegates . The high end High Street brand is also a favourite of Samantha Cameron and the Duchess of Cambridge, and the fitted floral dress is part of a slick new wardrobe that Justine has deployed for the annual event at a crucial time in her husband's political career. To give her Young Labour speech on Monday the mother-of-two chose a classic black flared dress worn with LK Bennett heels and statement jewellery. She told supporters: ‘I wanted to come along to say a few . words because I thought, “If I don't say anything to you guys tonight . probably all you'll know about me this year is the make of the dress I . wear for Ed's speech on Tuesday”. ‘That's . a side of me the media tend to focus on and I thought it was quite . important to reassure you that I am in fact more than a dress.’ Her carefully crafted words on the first day of . the conference were just one part of a plan to 'humanise' husband Ed . and rescue his plummeting poll ratings. Previously Justine has been one of the more reticent political WAGs but is stepping up her involvement as Ed's poll ratings plummet . Justine wore a cherry red mac to walk through Brighton city centre in one of several photo opportunities during the Labour conference and chose a simple flared dress to give her 'more than a dress' speech . Justine was also snapped in a vivid red mac and smart black trousers on a photo . opp tour of the city with husband Ed in his 'smart casual' best on . Friday. Although always a stylish dresser, previously the child actress-turned barrister has been one of the more reticent politcal WAGs, and Ed has repeatedly claimed he would not . copy David Cameron’s habit of eye-catching photo opportunities while . opposition leader, and would instead focus on policies. But party strategists plan to put Justine . on the political frontline in the run up to the 2015 election and this week the Justine and Ed show has been unleashed on the world. The decision to bring Mrs Miliband into the . political fray has drawn comparisons with failed attempts by Gordon . Brown and Iain Duncan Smith to use their other halves to rescue their . leadership. As Justine promises to speak out publicly about why her husband of nine years should be Prime Minister, the Milliband children too have been . wheeled out in front of the world's press, swinging arm in arm along . Brighton beach like a mini Boden campaign. Brothers Daniel, four, and Samuel, two, have even been labelled as the party's secret conference weapon. Party strategists plan to put Justine on the political frontline in the run up to the 2015 election and used the party conference to unleashed the Justine and Ed show . The couple have been snapped in a series of stage managed photo opportunities designed to humanise the Labour party leader . The couple met in 2004, but didn't get married until 2011 when Justine chose an understated Temperley dress with no veil. As well as revealing her plans to take to the 'barricades' in support of husband in 2015 the environmental lawyer also revealed the . moment she realised she had fallen for him – while rearranging . chairs in a hall in Doncaster. She told delegates: ‘In May 2005, Ed was the prospective parliamentary candidate for Doncaster North. I was his friend. ‘So . I went to Doncaster to help him campaign and I was moving chairs around . in a hall getting ready for a campaign meeting and I became aware there . were three long-standing party members watching me. ‘After . a while one of them said to me who was I, so I explained that I was a . friend of Ed's and I had come from London to help him campaign. Labour leader Ed Miliband and his wife Justine take their children Daniel (right) and Sam (left) for a walk along Brighton beach on the eve of the Labour Party annual conference . Lookalike: Mr Miliband's smart casual attire has been compared to the clothes worn by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg during a recent photo call . ‘There . was a pause and then the lady said to me, “That's a very long way to . come to move chairs, are you sure you're just friends?”. ‘She was clearly very astute and realised before we did I think.’ The . mother-of-two also told Young Labour members she is willing to help . them in the run-up to the 2015 general election before joking: ‘After . all you now know I can door-knock, I can move chairs although I guess . falling in love at the same time probably gave it a bit of a different . dimension. Nonetheless I am ready and willing.’ Ed Miliband was forced to defend the 'cheesy' family photographs, which contrast sharply with . Gordon Brown’s refusal to be photographed with his own young children . and the former Prime Minister’s accusation that David Cameron used his . own family as ‘props’ in photographs. Asked by the BBC’s Andrew Marr why he had . decided to bring them into the public eye ‘with 500 cameras’ present, . he said: ‘I love having my family here. It’s a great support and a great . thing for me to have them here.' Ed Miliband has defended the pictures of him and his family saying: ¿I love having my family here. It¿s a great support and a great thing for me to have them here.'","Leader's wife has vowed to speak out in run-up to 2015 general election .

This BMX biker has made the most of his Citi Bike rental - using the clunky cycle to do wheelies, tricks and grinds. In this amazing footage, professional rider and bike shop owner Tyrone Williams does several impressive tricks around the streets of New York City. After picking up his bicycle on South 3rd Street and Bedford Avenue, the biker does an almost impossibly long wheelie down a deserted street. Scroll down for video . Let's go! Tyrone picks up his bike on South 3rd Street and Bedford Avenue . Hot wheels: The BMX biker then does a wheelie on the heavy bike . Hop: Tyrone scales a ramp, then jumps down a series of steps . Messing around: The biker puts both feet on one pedal and rides along . Trick: The pro does a bunny hop down a street . Tyrone then drives the heavy blue bike up a ramp before jumping down a series of steps. Afterwards, he rides off along a road before doing a bunny hop. Later, the talented rider takes his feet off the pedals and places them on the handle bars, before reclining back with his arms outstretched. Tyrone can then be seen in a skate park doing jumps, spins and grinds. Relaxing: Tyrone strikes a pose on the Citi bike . Let the games begin: The pro rides around the edge of the skate park before jumping up onto a different level . Flying high: The biker gets some air off a ramp in a skate park . Nice moves! Tyrone performs a grind in a skate park . Impressive: In one particularly amazing clip, the pro jumps over a bench . Towards the end of the video, he is joined by fellow bikers on BMXs. But Tyrone doesn't let his clunky bike hinder him - speeding round steep corners and over bumps. Finally, he finishes by parking the bike back in the docking station where he started. In a comic twist, he then presses the 'service' button to make sure the bike is looked over after his ride. The footage has now been uploaded on several websites and has been shared several hundred times. Daredevil Tyrone was asked to test the bike out in the unusual way by online magazine, Animal New York. Fans of the video today reacted to the footage on Twitter, saying it was the 'coolest thing ever'. Keeping up: Tyrone is met by other BMX riders, who race around a dirt track . Round the bend: The biker scales some sharp turns on the track . Lift: The biker takes his feet of the pedals during one jump . One, Mike Rigg, said: 'Citi Bike + BMX Pro Tyrone Williams = the coolest thing that will ever happen to bikesharing' Another, Russ Bengtson, said: 'Tyrone Williams is the best' As well as being a professional rider, Tyrone owns Manhattan bike shop Dah Shop - the first BMX specific shop in the city with friend, Qian. Can't resist: Tyrone does another wheelie in front of some graffiti . Back to the start: The rider docks the bike before pressing the 'service' button . He also innovated a unique street style of riding called 'Rone', several videos of which are on YouTube. The Citi Bikes were launched in New York in May. They are usually used by tourists and locals to get them from A to B and can be hired for a day, week or a year from stations around the city. But, much like the so-called 'Boris Bikes' in London, they are heavy, clunky and slow - especially in comparison to the high-end BMXs Tyrone would usually perform tricks on.","Pro BMX rider Tyrone Williams rides a Citi Bike around New York City .

A young man risked his life to satisfy his thrills when he climbed an 84ft-high gas holder above a city centre to take a photo of the sunrise from the top. James Kingston, 23, sought to capture the entirety of the city in its best light, so climbed the Northam Gas Works in Southampton at 6am. Despite 8ft of barbed wire and several warning signs, Mr Kingston braved the heights, enraging authorities further by also completing two full laps of the red metal structure. Morning view: James Kingston, 23, climbed the Northam Gas Works in Southampton as the sun rose at 6am to capture the city . Police and safety experts slammed Mr Kingston after he posted a picture of himself on top of the Northam Gas Works. Mr Kingston from nearby Romsey, Hampshire said he had wanted to climb the structure for years. He said: ‘I had always wanted to scale the building - it is an impressive landmark in Southampton and I love the way it looks. ‘I have driven past there before many times and I finally had the time to do it so I thought why not? I walked around the rim twice. It was amazing. ‘The view was incredible, it was a really nice morning and seeing the sunrise there was amazing.’ Braving it: Mr Kingston stands on the 1ft-wide ledge with Southampton in the background . High risk: Authorities slammed Mr Kingston for his reckless behaviour, as he even did a few rounds around the circular construction . Rise above it: Standing on the narrow ledge, Mr Kingston takes in the view from the tower at his feet . He previously caused controversy when he dangled with one hand from a 300ft crane above the Ocean Village marina in Southampton. James, who has been a professional free runner for six years, added: ‘I don't do this to cause any trouble and I'm not looking to climb any more cranes in Southampton. ‘I just don't have a huge urge to do it again any time soon.’ Responding to criticisms that his antics encourage others to put their own lives in danger, he added: ‘I do not want people to join me, I just do it for myself. ‘Obviously this would be really dangerous if you didn't know what you were doing. ‘But I am happy that people are becoming more aware of what I do and opening their minds to it. ‘I live for adventure and putting myself in situations I have never been in.’ Hampshire police slammed James's latest actions and believe he is encouraging others to emulate his terrifying antics. A spokesman said: ‘James has put himself at considerable risk again and continues to do so.' Big climber: Mr Kingston snaps himself as he makes his way to the top of the 84ft construction . ‘He could have easily died if he'd fallen. People should not see these photos as inspiration to follow in James footsteps. ‘We would advise anyone to think long and hard before doing anything like this. ‘If they are not concerned for their own safety then they should think of the others, like their family or witnesses that could be affected if they were to fall.’ Southern Gas Networks, which own the gas works, said it would be launching a full investigation. A spokesman said: ‘It appears from the footage this individual has accessed some of our low-level equipment inside the site at Britannia Road in Southampton. ‘As we take security extremely seriously we are currently carrying out a full investigation. ‘We do everything reasonable to keep our sites secure and this is an extremely rare example of a member of the public trespassing on our land.’ In response, James offered to help Southern Gas make its site more secure in future. He added: ‘I actually found it really easy to get into this site. ‘I helped design a new anti-climb device for the crane I climbed at Ocean Village and I'll gladly help with this site's security.’","Daredevil defies the heights of gas holder to capture sunrise city .

"By . Aaron Sharp and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 02:59 EST, 23 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:28 EST, 23 September 2013 . Criminal history: Israel Alverez, 33, was arrested for family violence on September 11 and now police believe he shot his family before killing himself . A couple and their three children have been found dead inside their Texas home in what police now believe is an apparent murder-suicide. The father of the slain children, Israel Alvarez, was arrested on a domestic assault charge less than two weeks before his body and that of his wife Guadalupe Ronquillo-Ovalle and their three young children were discovered. Alvarez's father was the one to call police on Sunday night and report the slaying inside the family's home in Rice, a town about 40 miles south of Dallas. The five bodies were all found with gunshots in their abdomens, and police are still awaiting autopsies as they try to determine who fired the fatal shots. Navarro County Sheriff Elmer Tanner said a rifle was found at the home. Investigators were trying to determine when the shootings took place, Tanner said, saying the children, ages 4, 8 and 12, were in school Thursday afternoon but missed classes Friday. Given the nature of the crime scene and Alverez's criminal history, police do not believe that the killer is on the loose. 'We have not seen anything yet that makes us think we need to go outside this location,' Sheriff Tanner said early into the investigation. Alvarez was arrested September 11 on a misdemeanor family violence charge for pushing Ronquillo-Ovalle and taking away her phone because he thought she was talking to another man, she told deputies. Scene: Police found the bodies of Alverez, his wife and their three children with gunshot wounds to their torsos. Investigators also found a rifle in the house . According to a sheriff's office report released Monday, the woman went to her children's elementary school to call 911 because Alvarez took away her cell phone and removed the battery. She told a deputy that she was on the phone talking to her sister when Alvarez entered the room and pushed her. Alvarez was charged with family violence assault, a misdemeanor. He pleaded no contest, paid a $367 fine and was released after spending two days in jail, records show. No divorce filings or requests for a restraining order were filed, and Ronquillo-Ovalle did not ask for a protective order, according to records. When they got the call on Sunday night, police immediately recognized the address of the home because of the previous problems that had been reported. Next step: Navarro County Sheriff Elmer Tanner said they are waiting to get the autopsies back to determine when the shootings took place. The children missed school on Friday and their grandfather discovered the bodies on Sunday . 'I haven’t had an opportunity to confirm what those calls have been in the past. I’ve heard from the call center that over two or three years, officers have been to this location,' Sheriff Tanner said to the local NBC affiliate at the time. 'I don’t care where you are. Any time there’s five losses of lives in one location, that’s shocking and traumatic. 'It doesn’t make any difference where you are. It’s a horrible, horrible thing to see, witness or be a part of. 'As far as looking for a suspect, what I’m saying at this point in time is that we are concentrating our efforts on the investigation at the residence.' Share what you think .

Defense lawyers for three former US Naval academy football players accused of raping their female classmate spent an estimate of 30 hours over the course of a few days asking the victim inappropriate questions about her sex life. In addition to asking the victim whether or not she apologized to one of her classmates for being a 'ho,' they asked her if she was wearing a bra and underwear at the party and asked her how she opened her mouth to perform oral sex. The defense tried to argue that the victim's opening her mouth counted as 'active participation' and therefore qualified as sexual consent. The alleged assault took place in . April 2012 at an off-campus house in Annapolis referred to as 'the . football house.' The then 20-year-old Naval Academy Sophomore woke up . with bruises after a . night of heavy drinking and later learned from friends and social media . that three football players claimed to have had sex with her while she . was intoxicated .

The victim was at first hesitant to press charges against classmates Trav'es Bush, Eric Graham, and Joshua Tate. The Girl's attorney Susan Burke said that when the girl first reported allegations to Navy Criminal Investigators she was disciplined for drinking and the boys were allowed to continue playing. In early 2013, the female student decided to seek legal help and the Navy re-opened the investigation, Burke said. Now the girl's rape trial is an . Article 32 proceeding, a military hearing meant to determine whether or . not a case is trial material. According to The New York Times, Article 32 proceedings, 'permit questions not allowed in civilian courts and can include . cross-examinations of witnesses so intense that legal experts say they . frighten many victims from coming forward.' The 'football' house in Annapolis where the victim was allegedly raped by her classmates . Many military Legal experts want to get rid of Article 32 proceedings. Diane H. Mazur, a professor at The University of Florida said, 'What this case shows is that we think the military justice system can somehow solve the sexual assault problem, but it can’t.' Explicitly sexual questions like the one's asked by the defense in this trial would not be asked in a civilian case. Even though people like Mazur are against the proceedings, Defense Department Officials say the proceedings are meant to protect innocent victims and ensure that there is sufficient enough evidence to go to trial. Senator Kristen E. Gildebrand is currently working on a bill that would remove military assault cases from the chain of command. Susan Burke, the victim's lawyer filed a federal lawsuit to strip the Naval Academy's superintendent of authority over the case.","Defense attorneys tried to prove that the victim's opening her mouth counted as 'active participation'

A bedridden man who allegedly ordered cruel beatings of his eight-year-old daughter, made her drink her urine and forced her to be tied to his bed has been charged with her murder. Even though 28-year-old Andre Ford was himself unable to touch his daughter, prosecutors maintain that the man, who suffers from a degenerative skin disease, caused her death. The girl, Gizzell Ford, was found dead in the Austin, Illinois home she shared with her father, her two older brothers and her grandmother on July 12. Firefighters responded to a call saying the little girl was not breathing and found her body covered in bruises, scratches and lacerations. They also found maggots in a cut to her head. Accused: Andre Ford, left, has been accused of killing his 8-year-old daughter Gizzell, right, even though he is bedridden. He allegedly ordered her to be abused and watched as his mother tortured her . An autopsy revealed that the cause of death was strangulation and multiple blunt trauma injuries, and the death was ruled a homicide. Ford and his mother, 52-year-old Helen Ford, both stand accused of murder in the case. They were the only adults living at the home, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. Authorities allege that from his bed, Ford forced the little girl to suck up her urine after she wet herself, ordered her to be harnessed to his bed and simply watched as his mother tortured her. The Illinois Department of Children . and Family Services also completed a report indicating that both Andre . and Helen Ford abused, neglected and starved Gizzell and her two . brothers. Loss: Gizzell was strangled to death and found with multiple bruises and lacerations to her tiny body . Scene: Firefighters found her body at the apartment she shared with her brothers, father and grandmother, pictured, after they got a call she was no longer breathing. They also found maggots in her wounds . 'It doesn't . happen everyday but we do charge people on the theory of . accountability,' Sally Daly, a spokeswoman with the State's Attorney's . Office, told the Sun-Times. 'Abuser': Her grandmother, 52-year-old Helen Ford, is also accused in the murder . Prosecutors listed several other . injuries found on the girl's body at an earlier hearing. They found a . deep laceration on her buttocks, ligature marks on the girl's ankles and . wrists and circular marks which may have been cigarette burns. There were cuts on her face, ears and lips, as well as bruises and puncture wounds on her back, chest and abdomen, with bruising on the front and back of her neck. Investigators also recovered a pole, . twine and cables from the apartment - some of which had blood on them, . according to the prosecutor. Ford suffers from the chronic degenerative disease of scleroderma, which leaves his skin and tissues hard. It has led some to question how he could be responsible in the death. But Bruce Boyer, director of Civitas ChildLaw Clinic at Loyola University's Law School, said the fact he did not contact authorities implicated him. 'You don't have to physically wrestle the person who is swinging the club,' he said. 'Pick up the phone, tell a neighbor.' He initially told authorities that his daughter's wounds were self-inflicted because she was upset that her mother had not been visiting, but he later admitted he stopped her from going to a summer camp so others did not see her injuries, prosecutors said. Missed: A neighbor lays down a toy at a memorial for the girl outside the home after she was killed in July . He also allegedly told detectives he never contacted authorities as he feared he would be blamed for her injuries. Ford has been transferred to a local hospital for treatment and is now awaiting trial with his mother. The two other children, aged 12 and nine, have been since placed in foster care.","Andre Ford charged with murder even though he did not touch daughter .

A high-flying US investment banker accused of sexual assault admitted performing a sex act on his alleged victim today. But Ed Sappin continues to deny committing sexual assault, which is alleged to have taken place last October at a flat in Hampstead after a wedding. Giving evidence today at Blackfriars Crown Court in central London, Sappin claimed the woman 'put her head very directly in my lap which was rather surprising'. Sappin said: 'I thought it was very forward. She put her head basically right in my groin area, not just in my lap. 'I tried to get her up to bring her to the bedroom and let her rest.' Sappin, who is chief executive of renewable energy firm Willowbrook Company, said he decided to sleep next to the woman, as the bed was large enough for them both. 'At some point a few minutes later we started kissing each other - I honestly can't remember who first,' he said. 'We were kissing each other for a few minutes. I started putting my hands on her body.' With his mother and wife in the public gallery of the court, Sappin described how he started to perform a sex act over his alleged victim's clothing. He told the court she 'seemed to be enjoying it'. Sappin, 39, then said she 'suddenly from one moment to the next got extremely upset'. Sappin added: 'I . honestly had no idea what was going on. I was just very shocked and at . the same time I saw she was in distress and wanted to try and calm her . down. 'I was very upset. Number one, that she was upset, number two, that I am a married man and I shouldn't have been in that room.' The police quickly attended after a neighbour was disturbed by the woman's screams, the court heard. 'I saw a police officer which was very surprising to me,' Sappin continued. 'I . really was just surprised and didn't know exactly what was going on. I . thought I had basically just ruined their (his friends') wedding weekend so I felt . horrible.' Sappin said the whole encounter lasted around 20 minutes. Cross-examining the accused, Peter Nugent asked: 'You accept that during this 20-minute encounter you could not see whether her eyes were open or not?' 'Yes, that's true,' Sappin said. Allegation: US Investment banker Ed Sappin has gone on trial at Blackfriars Crown Court in central London . Sappin, who lives in Brooklyn, New . York, made his name as a finance expert holding senior posts in several . Fortune 50 companies in the US. He is known as an 'impact-oriented leader' in business circles, and lives with his wife Yanhua and son Nathaniel. He describes himself as an 'innovation junkie' and is a former director at BP Solar. The court heard the alleged victim also travelled from the United States . for the wedding on Saturday, . October 20 of last year. Zennon Kapron, another American guest who . had attended the after-party, gave evidence and was asked if he had . noticed any particular vibe between the alleged victim and Sappin by . prosecutor Peter Nugent. 'I wasn't particularly looking for it but no, I didn't,' Mr Kapron replied. After the woman fell asleep, Sappin volunteered to carry her to a spare bedroom, the court heard . 'What did you hear coming from the bedroom?,' Mr Nugent asked. Mr . Kapron said he had heard voices, which 'turned to screams as (the . alleged victim) came out of the bedroom and down the hall'. 'From what I can recall she said ""call the police, get me out of here, get me away from him,""' Mr Kapron added. The victim then noticed an item of her underwear in the hallway, the court heard. The woman screamed 'what is that, what is that?' before trying to hide in a cupboard, Mr Kapron said. At some point, Sappin emerged from the bedroom, telling the woman, 'I'm sorry'. Mr Kapron said: 'It was clear that him being close to her wasn't helping, so I told him to wait out back.' The woman seemed 'agitated' by any males approaching her, the witness said, while Sappin looked 'shocked and apologetic'. Michelle Zellers, another American party-goer, said: 'She kept asking where her Spanx were'. Mr Nugent asked: 'She was unable to talk through what had happened to her?' Ms Zellers replied: 'Yes. She was pretty hysterical. 'She . kept saying, ""I don't get it, he's married, everyone likes him?""' Miss . Eleanor Laws, defence counsel, asked in cross-examination. 'Yes,' replied Ms Zellers. The court also heard a statement from Alexander Brown, a neighbour who alerted police after being woken by the stir. 'I head the female screaming ""I can't get out, please help me, please stop,""' the statement read. In an interview under caution given the same night, Sappin maintained the woman had consented. 'After a couple of minutes we started kissing which she seemed to like,' he told police. 'She seemed to want to have sex.' Suddenly the woman began to scream and ran out of the room, leaving Sappin 'very surprised,' the court heard. 'I apologised immediately and stopped,' Sappin said. The trial continues.

An investment banker sexually assaulted a fellow  wedding guest after she fell asleep, a court heard yesterday. Ed Sappin, 39, allegedly targeted the woman at a party at the bride’s flat after the ceremony. When she woke up to find him kissing her intimately, she screamed so loudly that neighbours called police, jurors were told. Sappin, a married father-of-one, made his name as a finance expert after working for several leading US companies. The self-described ‘innovation junkie’, a former director at BP, is now chief executive of The Willowbrook Company, which focuses on renewable energy. Blackfriars Crown Court in central London heard his alleged victim travelled from the United States for a friend’s wedding in Hampstead, north London, last October. Prosecutor Peter Nugent said: ‘At the end of the reception, towards midnight, a few of the guests discussed where to go next. The bride suggested that because she and her husband would be staying in a hotel that night, they take the keys to her flat. ‘They arrived at around midnight. The group stayed mainly in the living room, chatting, drinking and listening to music. ‘We say she [the victim] was extremely tired. She had flown into London from San Francisco. Mr Sappin lifted her up from the sofa and ushered her into the bedroom. ‘Her next recollection is of lying on her side in the bed with Mr Sappin lying behind her.’ The alleged victim then felt him pressing against her bottom while he touched her legs and kissed her neck. Mr Nugent said ‘she no longer had her underwear on’ as the defendant then prepared to perform a sex act. The woman later told police: ‘I think what snapped me out of being asleep was... he started kissing me. I think that is when I snapped and thought “oh my God”. ‘I ran out of the bedroom into  the living room and I just started screaming.’ She said she had previously felt safe around Sappin. ‘I have never in my life had the slightest moment of interest or attraction to him,’ she added. ‘I thought he was gay... I was shocked when I found out he was married.’ The court heard that after the incident she was so hysterical that she tried to hide in a wardrobe. ‘Such were her screams that an occupant across the road at around 4am called the police’, Mr Nugent said. By the time officers arrived, she was ‘capable of speaking only in single words’, he added. In court: Jurors at Blackfriars Crown Court heard how the alleged victim was so distressed following the incident, she tried to hide in a wardrobe . ‘The prosecution say that in the small hours, after a wedding and wedding reception, the defendant ushered the victim into a bedroom and whilst she was asleep and tired and exhausted we say he proceeded to sexually assault her. ‘She was not in a position at  that point of time to consent to sexual relations.’ The woman admitted she had ‘definitely been drinking’ but denied being so inebriated that she could not control her faculties. Having declined the use of a screen to protect her identity in court, she began to cry as she watched footage of her original police interview. Sappin was accompanied by his wife and mother to court, but neither of them entered the public gallery to watch the start of the trial.

It could have been the perfect opportunity for gangster’s son Desmond Noonan to go straight. Instead he used his share of his mother’s £1million lottery win to bankroll a big heroin deal. The 27-year-old member of one of Britain’s most notorious crime families – which has twice been featured in TV documentaries – was caught with two other men with a haul of drugs worth almost £25,000 after being targeted in a police surveillance operation. Noonan, who has served jail terms for carjacking and assault, was given a ‘significant portion’ of the money when his mother Mandy Burgess got lucky on a special Euromillions draw last September. He immediately bought a £350,000 house and an Audi Q7. But he also put some of the cash towards a large amount of heroin, which he planned to sell to drug users in Wigan, Manchester Crown Court heard. Police arrested him with his two accomplices just moments after they had collected the drugs from a house in Oldham. A black plastic bag recovered from under the front passenger seat of their car was found to contain a third of a kilogram of heroin, valued at £24,700.

Consumers borrowed a record-breaking £8.4billion on their credit cards last month, official figures revealed yesterday. More than four million transactions a day are being processed in the UK, with some people using their card to pay their mortgage or weekly food shop. Experts warned the figures, from the British Bankers’ Association, raise fears that millions are ‘surviving day-to-day’ on credit. Overall, the figures show the total that Britons owe on their credit card, has reached an all-time high of £38.7billion. In August 2007 – the month the credit crunch began – £7.2billion was borrowed on credit cards and the total outstanding was £29.4billion. The BBA said the credit card boom is a sign of a ‘growing consumer confidence’ among Britons following a time when they were too scared about the future to take on debt. But debt experts warn spending on credit cards is a classic sign of financial distress because it is one of the easiest ways to obtain money. Unlike a personal loan, which must be approved by a bank or building society, it is easy to borrow money on a credit card, typically ‘maxing out’ the card by borrowing up to your credit limit. Mark Sands, head of bankruptcy at the accountants RSM Tenon, said ‘the more desperate type of borrowing’ is done on a credit card, rather than other types of borrowing. He said: ‘Those who are still struggling are using credit card debt as a way of surviving day-to-day.‘If you have kept a couple of credit cards in the bottom of your drawer, but you’ve now lost your job and your bills are going up, you can max out your credit cards. The credit card boom is not the only sign of millions of people being forced to rely on debt to survive.Wonga.com, the controversial pay day loan firm, is handing out 10,400 loans every single day, lending up to £1,000 which arrives in your bank account within minutes. Just six years since it launched in this country, the company provided 3.8million loans last year, a rise of nearly 60 per cent on the previous year, according to its latest financial figures. Around 60 per cent of people with a credit card pay off their balance in full every month, according to the UK Cards Association. The average person typically has two credit cards. More than four million transactions a day are being processed in the UK, with some people using their card to pay their mortgage or weekly food shop . But this leaves 40 per cent of people taking on debt which they cannot afford to repay until they have been charged a crippling interest bill. A spokesman for Step Change, the debt charity, said many people are ‘having to resort to using their credit card simply to cover their essential household bills.’ He added: ‘We know that people will often over-estimate their ability to repay borrowing and that this can leave them in a deeper financial hole. ‘Lenders need to ensure that credit is being lent safely and appropriately and that it does not exacerbate existing financial vulnerability.’ Dr Howard Archer, chief UK economist at the consultancy IHS, said the toxic combination of pay freezes or a lack of decent pay rises for many years leaves many with no option but to use their credit card. Around 60 per cent of people with a credit card pay off their balance in full every month, according to the UK Cards Association. The average person typically has two credit cards . He said: ‘It is likely that markedly improving consumer confidence means people have become more prepared to borrow in recent months. ‘It may also be that the squeeze on consumer spending coming from inflation running well above earnings growth means that some people are having to borrow more to finance any major spending.’ Mortgage lending continues to rise, with the number of loans handed out to buy a home last month [aug] jumping by a quarter, compared to the same month last year. In August, there were 38,228 house purchase loans, the largest number since the end of 2009, according to the BBA. Many are saddling themselves with super-size mortgages, with house prices reaching record highs in many parts of the country. The average mortgage to buy a home is £156,800, compared to the country’s average full-time salary of £25,600.","Some people use their card to pay mortgage or the weekly food shop .

Pop stars like Katy Perry might sport Grillz, but in the future humans could have diamond-encrusted teeth to improve oral health . Hip-hop legends and popstars might be known for sporting Grillz jewellery over their teeth, but in the future humans could have diamond-encrusted teeth to improve oral health and fight disease. Scientists have discovered that tiny spherical diamonds could be used to promote bone growth and improve the durability of dental implants. The miniscule gems, which are invisible to the human eye, could be used to combat forms of bone loss including osteonecrosis, which is a potentially debilitating disease in which bones break down due to reduced blood flow. Scientists from the UCLA and the NanoCarbon Research Institute in Japan discovered that nanodiamonds - by-products of conventional mining that are four to five nanometers in diameter - could be used as a delivery system for proteins in the mouth as an improved treatment for osteonecrosis. The disease affects the jaw and can prevent people from eating and speaking. Bone loss also occurs next to dental implants, which leads to them becoming loose and uncomfortable, while failure of implants leads to more painful and expensive procedures. Dean Ho, professor of oral biology and medicine at the UCLA School of Dentistry, led the study published in the Journal of Dental Research. Dr Ho explained that doctors performing bone repair operations, which are typically costly and time consuming, surgically inset a sponge to administer proteins that promote bone growth such asbone morphogenic protein. His team discovered that using nanodiamonds to deliver these proteins could be more effective in administering the proteins as they quickly bind to the bone. The unique surface of the diamonds allows the proteins to be delivered more slowly, which may allow the affected area to be treated for a longer period of time. Furthermore, the nanodiamonds can be administered non-invasively, such as by an injection or even an oral rinse. Scientists have discovered that tiny spherical diamonds could be used to promote bone growth and improve the durability of dental implants. The miniscule gems, which are invisible to the human eye, could be used to combat forms of bone loss including osteonecrosis . Laura Moore, a PhD student at Northwestern University, which was also involved in the study, said the scientists have conducted studies in cells and animals. She said: 'Initial studies indicate that they are well tolerated, which further increases their potential in dental and bone repair applications.' Dr Ho believes that nanodiamonds are versatile platforms. He said: 'Because they are useful for delivering such a broad range of therapies, nanodiamonds have the potential to impact several other facets of oral, maxillofacial and orthopedic surgery, as well as regenerative medicine.' His team previously showed that nanodiamonds are effective at treating multiple forms of cancer in pre-clinical models. Osteonecrosis can be a side effect of chemotherapy, which is why the group of scientists decided to examine whether nanodiamonds might help treat the bone loss as well. Results from the new study could pave the way for more research into how nanodiamonds could be used to address different challenges in drug delivery. Dr No-Hee Park, dean of the School of Dentistry at UCLA, said: 'This discovery serves as a foundation for the future of nanotechnology in dentistry, orthopedics and other domains in medicine.'","Scientists from UCLA and the NanoCarbon Research Institute in Japan discovered nanodiamonds could be used as a delivery system for proteins .
The diamonds measure just four to five nanometers in diameter and are invisible to the human eye .

A woman who collapsed with a seizure discovered she had been living with a tumour half the size of her brain. Donna McWhinnie, 26, had no idea she had the cancerous glioma tumour, which had been growing for 10 years, until she was rushed to hospital after a sudden seizure. The tumour was 10cm by 5cm - half the size of her brain. The young mum had never suffered any serious health problems before she fell ill suddenly on February 24. Donna McWhinnie (pictured with her son, Taylor), 26, was diagnosed with a brain tumour after she collapsed while staying with a friend. Doctors were amazed that she had not experienced any other symptoms . Ms McWhinnie, who lives in Wishaw, South Lanarkshire, had been staying at a friend's house when she collapsed in the bathroom. She said: 'I had been staying at my friends pub in Falkirk and I woke up the next morning feeling unwell but thought it might just be a hangover. 'I was numb all down my right side. Someone handed me a can of Irn Bru, I was holding it but I couldn't feel it in my hand. 'I hit my head on the bath but thankfully my friend Pamela was there. She saved my life.' Pamela, 25, who now lives with Ms McWhinnie, raised the alarm and put her friend in the recovery position. She said: 'It was really scary but I knew Donna needed me so I stayed really calm.' Ms McWhinnie's tumour is slow-growing but she has had to have radiotherapy and may also require chemotherapy . Ms McWhinnie was rushed to hospital in Larbert where she suffered two further seizures before being transferred to Edinburgh for an MRI scan which confirmed the tumour on the left side of her brain. She said: 'It is a glioma tumour which is slow growing and is grade two on a scale of one to four, four being the worst. 'The doctors couldn't believe that I have had no symptoms. I have been through childbirth but felt nothing in my head. 'The part of my brain affected is the area associated with emotions. 'I am not an emotional person and I never cry. So that makes a bit of sense.' Ms McWhinnie underwent a biopsy and then radiotherapy at the Beatson Cancer Centre, in Glasgow, which she attended five days a week for six weeks. The tumour caused epilepsy which left her unable to drive. Ms McWhinnie, who is mother to 21-month-old Taylor, has amazed her friends and family with her resolve in the face of serious illness and gruelling treatment. She said she is determined to keep her spirits up for the sake of her son and added: 'Taylor has no idea, he keeps me going. 'I have been told that it could flare up again in the next 10 to 20 years and I could need chemotherapy. 'But I don't want to know when that might happen and I am not waiting around for it.' Ms McWhinnie is now epileptic so is not allowed to drive. She gave up her job as a hair dresser to do charity work and to spend more time with Taylor . Ms McWhinnie was given good news when a scan revealed her tumour had not increased in size and the pressure in her head had reduced. She said: 'The tumour was never going to get any smaller but it is good to know that the pressure is reduced. 'The doctors told me that they are really surprised that I wasn't crippled with headaches because of the pressure in my brain. More than half of all primary brain tumours are gliomas. They develop from the glial cells in the brain and are malignant but slow-growing. Symptoms include headaches, nausea, vomiting, seizures and vision problems. Gliomas are rarely curable but the prognosis depends on the grade of the tumour - they are graded from one to four with grade one and two tumours counting as low-grade and grade three and four tumours counting as high-grade. The most common forms of treatment are radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Patients with high-grade gliomas only have a 50% chance of surviving for a year after diagnosis. People with low-grade gliomas have a 50% chance of living for ten years after their diagnosis. 'There is a chance that it will grow again in the future and I will need chemotherapy but for now I just have to monitor my symptoms and go for regular checkups. At the moment I feel fine.' Ms McWhinnie's positivity has amazed her proud family and her mother Lesley McWhinnie said of her daughter: 'Nobody could fill Donna's shoes - I don't know where she gets the strength.' Ms McWhinnie is determined to live her life to the full and has given up her hair salon in Wishaw to spend as much time as possible with her son. After discovering her tumour she has selflessly decided to dedicate her time to helping others. She organised an action-packed fundraising night in Wishaw recently and hundreds of friends and family members turned up to support her. She said: 'It was a great night and I would like to thank everyone who donated so generously. 'We raised £3,000 for The Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre and £3,000 for Brain Tumour Research. 'My target was £5,000 so I am really pleased that I managed to raise so much. 'Life is what you make it. If I lie down and let this tumour beat me then it will.'","Donna McWhinnie, 26, collapsed while visiting a friend .

An eight-year-old boy has been diagnosed with an incredibly rare genetic disorder which makes him look 'pregnant'. Aadam Asif is one of only 17 people in the UK to suffer from Niemann-Pick, Type B, which causes an enlarged liver and spleen. He was born with the condition, which caused his stomach to protrude, but doctors only discovered he had the disease last year. Aadam Asif, eight, has a rare genetic condition called Niemann-Pick, Type B, that causes his spleen and liver to be enlarged. He is also small for his age, bruises easily and lacks strength . Tragically, there is no cure for the disease and Aadam is not expected to live to see adulthood. His devastated father Mohammed, 36, had no idea he and his ex-wife were both carriers of the Niemann-Pick gene. Mr Asif, from Moseley, Birmingham, said: 'He has always had a slight belly but whenever we took him to the GP he said it was fine and nothing to worry about. 'Over the years his stomach has swelled which has given him the appearance of looking pregnant. 'When he started school I was determined to get answers. His tummy felt quite solid to touch.

He has had the condition since birth but he was only diagnosed last year . 'Aadam was also very small in size, the smallest in his class and he didn’t have the strength that other kids have. 'His breathing was heavy too. 'He was getting bruised very easily. I gave him a bath and he had a bruise on his arm after just washing. Tragically, there is no cure for the disease and Aadam (pictured at 10-months-old) is not expected to live to see adulthood . 'His co-ordination wasn’t what it should be for a boy of his age.' Mr Asif added: 'He finds the rough and tumble at school very difficult and he is very fearful. 'He has the innocence of a five-year-old, although he is eight. 'He is very self-disciplined and enthusiastic about life. It is good to see him getting up early and getting ready for the day.

Aadam was finally diagnosed with the disease when he was referred to Birmingham Children’s Hospital for blood tests and X-rays. Mr Asif, a part-time lorry driver who also has a daughter Alina, 10, who does not have the condition, said: 'When you are told that devastating news it doesn’t hit you straight away. 'It is such a shock. Aadam was seven-years-old by the time of his diagnosis and by then it was more noticeable that there was something wrong with him.

'There is no treatment and no cure - you just have to manage the condition and look after him. 'He is aware he has something wrong with him but he is so brave and is always smiling.

Mr Asif said: 'He is aware he has something wrong with him but he is so brave and is always smiling. I am incredibly proud of him' 'We don’t know what his life expectancy is but I am determined to give him the best life possible.' Mr Asif is now raising money for the charity Jeans for Genes. Jackie Imrie, clinical nurse practitioner specialising in Niemann-Pick, said: 'There is hope for the future as we have just started a three clinical trial involving adult patients. 'The trial involves replacing an enzyme which causes the swelling of the liver and spleen into the blood via a drip every two weeks. 'Hopefully this will produce positive results for the future.' Niemann-Pick, Type B is an inherited condition which affects lipid metabolism. People with the condition suffer a build up of lipids in the spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow and brain. Signs include an enlarged liver and spleen, slow growth and problems with lung function. Suffers also often have blood abnormalities such as elevated cholesterol levels and low platelet levels. The condition is caused by mutations in the SMPD1 gene. There is no cure and treatments are only able to manage the symptoms. Many people with the condition survive into their teens or even early adulthood.","Aadam Asif has Niemann-Pick, Type B, a genetic condition causes the liver and spleen to become enlarged - it causes his stomach to protrude .

Last week Sainsbury’s recalled its own-brand salads over fears that watercress had been contaminated with a rather nasty form of food poisoning – six people needed hospital treatment. Last year, we investigated the dangers of bugs in bagged salad and found that the food poisoning bacteria E.coli could be present in as many as one in 20 supermarket-bought salad leaves. Levels were enough to cause illness. Most people are careful when it comes to meat, fish and eggs but just throw salad from the bag to a bowl. Poisoned plants: One in 20 bagged salads bought in the supermarket could contain E.coli strain O157 . I know salad bags say ‘wash first’, but how  dangerous is it not to? E.coli is a harmless resident of our gut – what is often termed ‘friendly bacteria’. The strain that caused this current and other outbreaks is called E.coli O157 and it is highly toxic to humans. When this strain enters the gut, it causes severe gastroenteritis. Six per cent of people go on to develop a life-threatening kidney failure called haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Infections such as E.coli O157 are transmitted to humans by eating contaminated foods. For salad to be affected, it must have been contaminated directly by waste. Iceberg lettuces are often grown in soil-free environments, but even this is no protection. The risk is from water used for irrigation, for example. If there is E.coli lurking in salad, will a simple rinse  under the tap be enough to get rid of it? The Health Protection Agency advises that all salad should be washed thoroughly by immersing in cold water, and also must not be contaminated by raw meat. Storage  of vegetables is key: if salad bags are in the fridge and the temperature is less than four degrees, bacteria will not multiply as rapidly. Care to clean: Ensure that all bought salad leaves are washed thoroughly before you eat them . What about other foods you eat raw? Without scaremongering,  there are plenty of different  types of food poisoning from raw food, but hygienic practices and  food standards protect us most of  the time. Listeria is possible from  meat and salmonella is usually  picked up from eating contaminated raw meat, eggs or dairy produce.  The reason that these outbreaks make headlines is that thankfully they are not common. There are only about 200 cases a year of listeria in the UK. I’ve had an E.coli urine infection before. Is that anything to do with food? No it’s not. E.coli is the most common cause of bacterial  urine infections in women in the UK, accounting for more than 70 per  cent of cases. This is from self-contamination, as in women everything is rather close together anatomically. To be completely blunt, this is why little girls should always be told ‘wipe from front to back’. Fortunately, this strain is not related to O157 and is simple to treat . Are we becoming more prone to food poisoning as  our lives become more sterile? There is no evidence to suggest that this is the case. With the mass processing of food, the  supply chain is still susceptible to contamination, as supposedly happened with this watercress, and we can’t be blase about that. When you look at figures over the past few years for food poisoning, rates  of certain illnesses such as salmonella have steadily reduced, while O157 has increased. This is more to do with farming processes and contamination than our own immunity to these diseases.","One in 20 supermarket salads could contain E.coli strain O157 .

Mushrooms grown in Siberia could be used to create a new treatment for AIDS, Russian scientists claim. The researchers say that Chaga mushrooms growing on birch trees are a ‘promising’ subject for further research. Scientists at the Vector Institute, near Novosibirsk, say that they have three different mushrooms all of which could be used in antiretroviral medicines but that the Chaga mushroom is showing the most promise. Chaga mushrooms (pictured) grown in Siberia could be used to create a new treatment for AIDS, Russian scientists claim . 'Strains of these mushrooms demonstrated low toxicity and a strong antiviral effect,' a statement from the Institute said. They could be effective against influenza, smallpox and HIV, The Siberian Times reports. The mushrooms are thought to contain betulinic acid which has antiretroviral and anti-inflammatory properties. The mushrooms have been used by traditional healers in Siberia for centuries. Some people believe they also have cancer-combating properties. Chaga mushrooms are referenced as a treatment for cancer in Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s Cancer Ward which was published in 1967. The mushrooms could be effective against influenza, smallpox and HIV (pictured) However, experts at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre in New York said that no clinical trials have been carried out to establish whether Chaga is a safe or effective method of disease prevention. The Vector Institute - also known as the State Research Centre of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR - is one of just two official repositories for the now-eradicated smallpox virus.

A US study found people who take statins to fight heart disease could be 27 per cent more likely to develop cataracts . Millions of people who take  statins to fight heart disease could be 27 per cent more likely to develop cataracts, researchers warn. Older people are particularly susceptible because they make up the majority of statin users and patients with cataracts, which cloud the eye and require surgery to prevent blindness. US researchers checked the medical notes of 14,000 people over more than eight years, divided equally between those who had used statins for at least three months and those had never taken the drugs. The scientists found the increased risk of 27 per cent for statin users held up even after they accounted for other factors  that could explain the result, such as high blood pressure. They said cholesterol was necessary to maintain healthy cells in the eye and the transparency of the lens. More than eight million Britons take statins – the most widely prescribed drugs in the UK. GPs wrote out 61million prescriptions in England alone during 2011. The drugs are only given to patients with at least a 20 per cent risk of having a heart attack or stroke within ten years. Research from Oxford University looking at 27 statin trials involving 175,000 people, some of whom were at low risk of heart problems, found the drugs cut the risk of heart attacks, strokes and operations to unblock arteries by at least a third. The effects helped all patients, even those who started out with the highest cholesterol levels. Healthier people who were given statins also had lower overall death rates than those who were given a placebo. It concluded the benefits greatly exceeded any side-effects from taking the drugs. There have been calls for everyone over 50 to be offered statins because it would stop some from having their first heart attack.But in a report in the journal JAMA  Ophthalmology yesterday, the US researchers behind the latest study warned this could be counterproductive because of the increased raised cataract risk. Statins are only given to people with at least a 20 per cent risk of having a heart attack or stroke within ten years . Dr Jessica Leuschen, of San Antonio Military Medical Center, Texas, added: ‘This study found statin use to be associated with an increased risk for cataract. Weighing the benefit-risk ratio of statin use, specifically for primary prevention, should be carefully considered.’ Her thorough study follows mixed results from earlier research, with one report claiming statins make patients up to 50 per cent less likely to develop cataracts. Around one in three people over 65 develop cataracts, and 341,000 operations were carried out last year on the NHS. Clara Eaglen, of the Royal National Institute for Blind People, said: ‘Many people are prescribed statins to help lower their  cholesterol and if they have any concerns about their medication they should discuss this with their GP before taking any action. ‘Cataracts can prevent some people from driving, undertaking work that requires fine detail and recognising faces. ‘Any research which could help prevent unnecessary sight loss through eye conditions such as cataracts is a welcome step.’ As well as cataracts, research has linked statins to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, constipation, diarrhoea, headaches, loss of appetite and loss of sensation or pain in the nerve endings of the hands and feet. The Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Products Agency has also warned about the risk of sleep disturbances, memory loss, sexual dysfunction, depression and certain lung diseases.","US researchers checked medical notes of 14,000 people over eight years .

'I tried to pretend I was happy squeezing into a size 20 dress, but the truth is I was heartbroken. I never imagined I would be a fat bride. 'I had really horrible thoughts of me looking like a whale as I waddled down the aisle. 'So I went from eating around 3,500 calories a day to a much more balanced diet which helped me to exercise regularly.' Mrs McGinlay struggled to breathe during exercise - even walking on the beach with her son Aiden was a chore . Sam McGinlay and Brian McGinlay pictured shortly after they got together in 2005. 'I was convinced we looked weird together because Brian was so slim,' said Mrs McGinlay . Mrs McGinlay took on a largely sedentary office job when she was 17 and, after a year of desk snacks and little exercise, her weight had increased from her natural 11 stone to 15 stone. Mrs McGinlay struggled to control her eating impulses over the next decade. 'Crisps were one of my weaknesses. I ate packets and packets, but told myself I wasn’t doing myself any harm. 'I remember at age 18, weighing myself before a big night out with my best friend, and the scales tipped 17 stone. It was so embarrassing. 'I was bored and self-conscious and in need of cheering up, and that just made me crave fatty, sugary foods even more.' Mrs McGinlay underwent a gruelling exercise regime to fit into her size 12 dress for her wedding day . Mrs McGinlay and Mr McGinlay married on August 3rd at the Three Kings function centre near Falkirk, followed by a honeymoon to the Trossachs in Scotland. At this point, Mrs McGinlay had lost 11 stone . She met Brian McGinlay, 31, through friends in the year 2000 and they began dating in 2005. Mr McGinlay said: 'I didn’t care what size Sam was, it was her personality I was attracted to. 'But I could see she was unhappy. There were times I could not bear to see her so upset.' Mrs McGinlay, who works at an accountancy firm, said: 'I was 18 stone and convinced we looked weird together because Brian was so slim. 'I looked awful in holiday photographs. I was ashamed to look so overweight compared to my friends.' The birth of the couple’s son, Aiden, in December 2009, pushed Mrs McGinlay’s dieting plans down her list of priorities.

Aiden came first, and that was that. 'I’d lost a small amount of weight a year before giving birth, but around the time of our five-year anniversary, when Aiden was three months old, I was back to size 20.' Mr McGinlay proposed with a white gold ring set with a cluster of diamonds, and Mrs McGinlay knew it was time to take action. She said: 'I had tried losing weight before, but now I was truly determined. I knew I needed the support of other people, so I joined exercise classes and slimming groups. 'I began to enjoy high-intensity exercise like Metafit cross-training which involves springs, lunges, squats and plank holds, and Zumba. 'I spent at least two and half hours a week on my bike, and went for frequent 10 kilometer hill walks.' The couple pose for pictures after their wedding on August 3rd. Forklift driver Mr McGinlay also went on a reduced calorie diet in support and lost two stone . Before her weightloss revelation, Mrs McGinlay would tuck into a bacon roll and creamy coffee for breakfast, followed by a cheese and mayonnaise sandwich for lunch and, for dinner, huge portions of hearty meals like meat with patties and bread and butter. Snacks would include thick crisps and sweets. The new Mrs McGinlay enjoyed a cup of tea with rich tea biscuits and a banana for breakfast, a wafer-thin ham and light cream cheese sandwich on wholemeal bread with a yogurt for lunch and portion-controlled reduced-fat curry for dinner, with grapes for a snack. Forklift driver Mr McGinlay also went on a reduced calorie diet in support and lost two stone.

Injections of the anti-wrinkle jab Botox can now be used to treat bladder dysfunction in women. Drugs regulator the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has ruled that those with an overactive bladder, a common cause of incontinence, should have access to the drug if other methods of control prove ineffective. Up to one in five people in England and Wales suffers from the syndrome, with symptoms including a frequent urgent need to use the lavatory. Botox your bladder: The injection commonly used to treat frownlines has been given the green light as a treatment against an overactive bladder . ‘Botox gives dramatic improvements for many and allows them to resume a normal lifestyle,’ says Mr Andrew Hextall, a consultant urogynaecologist from Spire Bushey Hospital and St Albans City Hospital in Hertfordshire. Botox is a prescription-only medicine that contains tiny amounts of highly purified botulinum toxin. Injections directly into muscles cause them to become paralysed. Botox is best known as an anti-wrinkle treatment but now its success in clinical trials for urinary incontinence has led to its licence from NICE. Frozen faces: Botox contains tiny amounts of highly purified botulinum toxin which paralyses muscles . ‘Botox paralyses the bladder muscles and stops them squeezing when they shouldn’t,’ says Mr Hextall. ‘But the effects last only six to eight months so injections need repeating.’ It is recommended that lifestyle changes are tried first, such as cutting down on caffeine and alcohol, and introducing pelvic-floor exercises. Both men and women can develop an overactive bladder but it is twice as common in women, and most sufferers are over 40. he cause is unknown but the condition can be brought on by diabetes, infection, bladder stones or spinal injury.","Botox now licenced by National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence .

A little girl who was nearly suffocated by a birthmark is now beaming after surgeons rebuilt her disfigured nose. Despite being born prematurely at 27-weeks, Zoe Mitchell was a healthy baby and progressed well while in hospital. But within days, a small red mark across the bridge of her nose - thought to be as a result of an oxygen mask being too tight - developed into a huge, purple, blister which started to suffocate her.Doctors diagnosed a haemangioma, a birthmark caused by a benign tumour of the blood vessels in the skin. Zoe (pictured, left, at six-months-old and, right, now) had a haemangioma - a birthmark caused by a benign tumour of the blood vessels in the skin. It was so large that it made it impossible for her to breathe normally . It can grow rapidly and in severe cases, such as Zoe’s, it can block the airways. In a race against time, doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London had to fit a tracheostomy tube when Zoe was just eight-weeks-old to stop her suffocating. Since then, she has been on a long journey and now, at the age of nine, is all smiles again after surgeons reconstructed her nose using cartilage from her ear. Her mother, Caroline, 36, from Welling in Kent, said: ‘Zoe is so happy with it now. She is delighted with her new nose. It looks lovely. It is amazing.’ Zoe’s birthmark attracted cruel comments and stares until she had her first operation to remove the majority of it when she was four. Mrs Mitchell, a legal secretary, said: ‘We went ahead with the operation because we wanted her to look a bit “normal”. Going out every day and having people staring at you is not nice so we did it for her appearance. Zoe (pictured at two-weeks-old) was born prematurely at just 27-weeks. She had a red mark on her nose which was thought to have been caused by an oxygen mask . The mark grew quickly damaging Zoe's nose and putting her at risk of suffocation. Her parents say it was lucky that she was premature as it meant she was already in hospital when the growth started to affect her breathing. Zoe us pictured at five-weeks-old . ‘We have always been open with her about it. We told her that is her birthmark, her special nose. She got more aware of people staring as she has got older.’ Zoe also risked losing her eyesight as the tumour had got bigger and bigger and eventually took over her whole nose when she was just seven-weeks-old. Doctors put her on steroids in an attempt to shrink the growth but when that didn’t work Zoe, she started a 12-month course of chemotherapy in a bid to zap the tumour. When Zoe was just eight-weeks-old she had to be fitted with a tracheostomy tube to enable her to breathe. She is pictured at seven-months-old . Zoe was put on steroids but they failed to shrink the growth so she had a 12-month course of chemotherapy as well as surgery to remove most of the growth. She is pictured at 12-months-old . Recalling the ordeal, her mother said: ‘It was getting bigger and bigger and growing over the bridge of her nose, obscuring her eyes so rather than having round, football shaped eyes they were becoming shaped like a rugby ball from where the tumour was damaging them. ‘When they first said it was a birthmark I just thought it would be a little red mark. I’d never heard of them being raised tumours and had no idea they can do so much damage. ‘It was very daunting and stressful. It was constant hospital appointments in the first year so it was quite intense.’ The tracheostomy was removed when Zoe was 18-months-old but her nose remained disfigured so she had to have further surgery to rebuild it. She is pictured at the age of two . In July this year surgeons at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London operated to rebuild her nose. She said she is very happy with her new nose . It was only once the tumour had shrunk enough that Zoe was able to breathe unaided and the tracheostomy tube was removed after 18-months. But her nose was left disfigured and so Mrs Mitchell and her husband Dean, 36, consulted plastic surgeons at Great Ormond Street, who were able to re-build her nose. Mrs Mitchell, who also has a 12-year-old son, continued: ‘The damage it could have caused if it was not spotted straight away could have been fatal - it could have suffocated her. Zoe said: 'I think my new nose looks lovely now. I think my surgeon is very clever. I am very happy now' Zoe's mother, Caroline, said: 'We went ahead with the operation because we wanted her to look a bit ""normal"". Going out every day and having people staring at you is not nice so we did it for her appearance' ‘We were really lucky that she was born so prematurely in a way as we were already in the hospital when it was spotted so we were referred straight away. ‘The last operation was quite painful for her. She has got on so well. ‘She might have to have more surgery later on but not until she is about 16.’ Mrs Mitchell said: 'Zoe is so happy with it now. She is delighted with her new nose. It looks lovely. It is amazing' Zoe will probably need more surgery when she is 16. She is pictured with her mother Caroline, father Dean, and brother Callum, 12 . Zoe said: ‘People used to upset me when they stared at me and called me names. Now I am delighted that I had my operation. ‘I think my new nose looks lovely now. I think my surgeon is very clever. I am very happy now.’ David Dunaway, consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon and head of the craniofacial unit at Great Ormond Street Hospital, said: ‘Zoe has been a patient for many years. David Dunaway, consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon and head of the craniofacial unit at Great Ormond Street Hospital, said Zoe (pictured with her parents) has 'bravely coped' with her treatment . ‘Shortly after birth, she developed a large haemangioma on her nose which caused destruction of part of the nose and ulceration of the skin. ‘Zoe has had extensive treatment for her haemangioma and operations to reconstruct her nose. She has bravely coped with the condition and the treatment needed to reconstruct her nose. ‘Zoe is due to have more surgery in the future.’ For more information visit www.birthmarksupportgroup.org.uk . A haemangioma is the most common type of birthmark. It is a benign tumour of the cells which normally line the blood vessels. In these birthmarks, the cells multiply more rapidly than normal causing a collection of small blood vessels that form lumps in, or under, the skin. About one in every ten babies has a haemangioma and they are most common in girls and premature babies. They usually appear when the baby is about two-weeks-old and about 60 per cent develop on the head or neck. Most do not require any treatment but those near the eye, on the lips, or obstructing the airway do require treatment. Treatment options include pain relief, beta blockers, laser treatment, steroids and surgery.","Zoe Mitchell was born prematurely at 27 weeks but appeared healthy .

Homes and businesses could be built in national parks if developers pay to make up the damage elsewhere. In a speech on boosting the rural economy, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson backed the idea of developments in some of England’s most picturesque areas. In exchange construction firms would have to create new nature sites nearby to offset the damage caused. Recovery: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson claims more development in national parks would boost rural economies . The idea of increased development in England’s 10 National Parks including Exmoor, the Peak District, Dartmoor and the Lake District could be controversial. But Mr Paterson argued that it could play a part in wider government plans designed to help boost growth and revive the rural economy. He used a speech to the National Park Authorities Conference in Easingwold, York, to back the idea of ‘biodiversity offsetting’ in national parks. Where a new development damages the natural environment, then a new nature site must be created to cancel out the damage. Protections: National Parks including the Peak District could be open to more development under the plans . He said: ‘For too long we have allowed . the lazy assumption that the environment and growth are incompatible . objectives within the planning system. ‘I . believe that, with a bit of innovative thinking, in many cases it is . possible to have both. This is why I am particularly interested in . Biodiversity Offsetting. Offsetting gives us a chance to improve the way . our planning system works. ‘It gets round the long-running conundrum of how to grow the economy at the same time as improving the environment. ‘It . could provide real opportunities in our National Parks, where the . necessary extension of a farm building could result in the enhancement . of an existing habitat or the creation of a new one.’ Under . existing rules the National Park Authority has two statutory duties - . to conserve the countryside and its wildlife, and to allow people to . enjoy it. A spokesman . for the Campaign to Protect Rural England said: 'Exactly how would it be . possible for a developer to replace, for example, ancient hedgerows by . way of mitigation? 'Some . habitats, particularly sensitive ones, are irreplaceable and thoroughly . integral to the landscape's character because it's taken centuries to . evolve - you can't just order a new one to be delivered somewhere else . like it's an Amazon purchase. 'Offsetting . doesn't address the complex way in which wildlife systems are sustained . and thrive, and if it allows developers to push through damaging . schemes then it's just another way for money to win over protecting . nature.' Enbgland has 10 national parks including Lake District (left) and Dartmoor National Park in Devon . The government has launched a consultation on biodiversity offsetting, which is still open, Mr Paterson said. He stressed it was one of several policies which he thought could benefit national parks. He added: 'There are many opportunities for National Parks to seize upon. One of these is the opportunity to capitalise on and increase the 110 million people who visit the UK’s National Parks every year. 'Tourism is important because it provides people with new experiences.  It enables people to appreciate and put a value on wildlife and wild places. 'Tourism also helps grow the economy.  Tourists spend money in our National Parks and this supports 68,000 jobs. 'But also when tourists return home they are more likely to buy the products we export.  Great clothing, great food and great drink.'","Environment Secretary Owen Paterson backs 'biodiversity offsetting'

Labour has abandoned his flagship promise to cut VAT, Ed Miliband admitted today. The £12billion plan was the centrepiece of Labour’s so-called plan for jobs and growth and still features prominently on its website. But Mr Miliband was accused of ‘rank hypocrisy’ after claiming the economic circumstances have changed so he would not now promise to cut VAT at the next election. Reversal: Labour leader Ed Miliband admitted he would not cut VAT at the next election, despite it still being a promise on his party's website . Labour faced heavy criticism for the policy, after Mr Miliband admitted in April that it would lead to a rise in borrowing. VAT was increased from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent soon after the coalition was formed. On the Labour website the party boasts that is has a 'clear five-point plan for jobs, to help struggling families and support small businesses'. The plan also included a £2billion tax on bankers' bonuses, bringing forward investment projects, cutting VAT on home improvements to five per cent and a one-year national insurance tax break. It promises: 'Reversing the Tory-led Government's damaging VAT rise now for a temporary period - a £450 boost for a couple with children - immediate help for our high streets and for struggling families and pensioners.' Policy: Labour's plan for jobs still features prominently on the party's website but has been quietly ditched . Broken promise: Families were told a Labour government would make them £450 better off . But today Mr Miliband insisted it was not party policy. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ‘There isn't going to be a cut in VAT, that's not what we are proposing at the moment. ‘That's because the economic position has changed. We have always said as recovery took hold our focus would not be on a cut in VAT. ‘I think it would have been the right thing to do, it would have been a better approach in getting the deficit down. I would make the point the Government hasn't succeeded in getting the deficit down. ‘That's part of the issue we will have to be dealing with.’ Tory Treasury minister Sajid Javid seized on the admission, claiming it demolished Labour's credibility on the economy. 'This is the final nail in the coffin for Ed Miliband and Ed Balls’ economic policy,' he said. 'For the last three years a £12 billion VAT cut has been the central plank of Labour’s argument, and by abandoning it they are admitting that their argument has collapsed. 'All they are left with is unworkable and unfunded policies – meaning more spending, more borrowing and more debt. That’s exactly what got us into a mess in the first place. 'And it’s hardworking people who would pay the price through higher taxes and higher mortgage rates.' Mr Miliband said he was still committed to matching the coalition’s overall spending plans. ‘In 2015/16, we envisage cuts in public spending,’ he said. ‘That's what we've been clear about, by sticking to the Government's day-to-day spending plans. We have said we will make different choices on spending and revenue but sticking to that overall plan.’ But the reversal on the VAT cut was seized on by political opponents. Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Stephen Williams said: ‘Labour have spent the last three years aggressively attacking the Coalition for raising VAT. ‘Now they admit they won’t reduce it. This is rank hypocrisy from a party that has no answers to the big questions of the day – how to fix the economy, create jobs and help people with the cost of living. ‘Liberal Democrats have taken tough decisions in the national interest in order to clean up Labour’s mess, and Labour has called us every name under the sun for doing so. ‘They have been utterly shameless and deeply hypocritical.’","Party promised to reverse rise from 17.5% to 20% to boost jobs .

First-time parents Denise and Iain Page were told to expect the worst when their 13-month-old daughter suffered a stroke and three heart attacks in one go. Baby Willow 'died' three times in a hospital ward after contracting what doctors thought was a minor chest infection. The medical team said she would be lucky to survive - and if she did, she would be severely brain damaged. But the stunned surgeons have been forced to swallow their words after the fragile infant made a miracle recovery in just four weeks - and now she is as healthy as any other baby her age. Miracle: Willow Page's heart stopped three times in 12 days after she contracted heart disease . Beaten the odds: Days after a stroke that lasted 48 hours, the toddler made an almost full recovery . Terrified Denise, 34, and Iain, 39, from Spinney Hill, Northants, rushed their daughter to Northampton General Hospital on 23 June after she was repeatedly violently sick. After an initial scan, medics diagnosed Willow's heart attack as a chest infection. But her condition rapidly deteriorated and just three hours later she had another attack. Happy: Denise, a secretary, and Iain, a floor filler, were told their first-born would not make it - and if she did she would be severely brain damaged . Her heart stopped for four-and-a-half minutes - rendering her technically dead. Further tests showed Willow had contracted myocarditis - a severe form of heart disease. Most cases of myocarditis are contracted through a virus like mumps, the flu, or a common cold. The muscles of the heart inflame causing anything from a minor chest infection to life-threatening heart disease. Like all viruses, there is no clear treatment for the disease. Surviving against all odds, with only a quarter of her heart functioning, Willow was transferred to the specialist ward two hours' drive away at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester for a heart transplant. The fragile baby, unable to function independently, was put on life support as doctors plan their next step. But the medics changed tact when, after 12 days on an ECMO breathing machine, she seemed to have recovered, so they took her off. However, 45 minutes later, Willow's third heart attack hit, and she started having a stroke. For the next 48 hours she would suffer 25 violent fits, and 'die' twice. Doctors told Mr and Mrs Page their daughter had a bleed on the brain that could kill her or at least cause severe brain damage. Inexplicably, Willow made an almost complete recovery in just a few days. At the end of July - just four weeks after she was admitted - she was able to go . home. Mrs Page, who has two older children, said: 'The whole time Willow was in hospital just felt so surreal, we kept thinking that things like this don't happen to people like us. 'We were terrified. 'She went so quickly from a healthy, happy baby to fighting for her life. Relieved: Denise and Iain Page embrace their baby girl in hospital when doctors said she could go home . Misdiagnosis: Doctors told the couple their daughter had a chest infection after she had suffered a heart attack . 'When she had the first heart attack, . we thought that was the worst that could happen - but then to have . another two and a stroke was unthinkable. 'We started to worry what type of girl we would . end up with after all the trauma her body had faced. 'We didn't know whether she'd ever be able to walk, or even talk.' Two months later, she is still as healthy as any other 15-month-old baby. Home and healthy: Mr Page, 39, clutches his first-born, who is now as healthy as any 15-month-old baby . Recovered: Willow was on a life support machine for 12 days but incredibly fought her way back . Mr Page, 39, branded his first-born's recovery a 'miracle'. He said: 'My baby is back to the happy little girl she always was, she died three times but still managed to cling on to life - it's a miracle. 'She is a little fighter and amazed everyone by pulling through. We are so proud, and feel so happy to have her home.' The delighted couple have pledged to pay for a new £40,000 ECMO machine at Glenfield Hospital.","Willow Page, 13 months, suffered three heart attacks and a stroke in 12 days .

Corrupt court clerk David Kelly, 47, has been jailed for six years for helping more than 70 motorists to falsify their driving records and escape bans . A corrupt court official who helped more than 70 motorists to falsify their driving records and escape bans has been jailed for six years. David Kelly, 47, committed a 'gross breach of trust' in a betrayal of the criminal justice system, his colleagues and the general public, said a judge. Debt-ridden Kelly operated the scam from his workplace in the admin department at Liverpool Magistrates’ Court. He assisted 71 drivers in removing details of their convictions, disqualifications and penalty points on 110 occasions between 2004 and 2010. Preston Crown Court heard that drivers would pass on cash to 'middle men' who had contacts within the Liverpool underworld and their details would be handed to Kelly. The defendant then sent forms from the court to the DVLA to request the alterations. Sentencing him, Judge Graham Knowles QC said: 'Liverpool City Magistrates’ (Court) ran like every other magistrates’ court. 'The magistrates, the clerks and the office staff dealt with penalty points, so did the staff of the Central Ticketing Office. Civil servants in Swansea (at the DVLA) kept the drivers’ records. 'But unknown to all of these decent people, you, Kelly, were running a corrupt business at the court, bypassing justice after everyone thought it had been done.' It is understood that most of the corrupt payments from members of the public were made in pubs across Liverpool with £100 thought to be the going rate for erasing one penalty point. DVLA officers in Swansea first became suspicious of Kelly in September 2008 when he faxed a number of bogus forms, said the Crown. But Kelly, of Southern Crescent, Toxteth, was cleared to continue working after an internal investigation and was finally caught in April 2010 when court staff discovered bogus forms and driver details in a confidential waste sack. Yesterday, a jury found him guilty of conspiracy to pervert the court of justice. Three of his 'customers' who were in the dock with him - Shaun Robinson, Samantha Evans and Mark Camello - were convicted of perverting the course of justice. Camello, 33, of Nightingale Road, Toxteth, was jailed for 14 months, while Evans, 25, of Meldon Close, West Derby, and Robinson, 24, of Britannia Crescent, Toxteth, were each jailed for 12 months. Kelly had worked at the court for 20 years before he turned to corruption. Kelly ran the scam from Liverpool Magistrates' Court, pictured, where he worked . Judge Knowles told him: 'You perverted justice systematically and cunningly. You acted in gross breach of trust. 'You betrayed justice, the public, the magistrates and your decent, hard-working colleagues who like court staff everywhere are proud to play their part in justice.' He said Kelly continued the scam despite suspicion falling on him in September 2008, as he took on extra precautions such as changing his handwriting. Kelly also attempted to 'cast wholly unfounded suspicion' on former colleagues as his trial approached, the judge added. Addressing the other three defendants, Judge Knowles said: 'However much or little thought you gave to it that there had been a corrupt official to tamper with your records, there had to be make the scheme work. Three of Kelly's 'customers' (left to right) - Mark Camello, Samantha Evans and Shaun Robinson - were convicted of perverting the course of justice. Camello, 33, of Nightingale Road, Toxteth, was jailed for 14 months, while Evans, 25, of Meldon Close, West Derby, and Robinson, 24, of Britannia Crescent, Toxteth, were each jailed for 12 months . 'You knew that the corrupt official had an agent in the field - meeting you and many others in pubs and wherever else. 'You took your details and cash to hand them to the man you now know as David Kelly. 'Whether you were approached or you approached them, it is clear you were joining yourself to an ongoing and widespread crime and lining the pockets of a corrupt court official and a middle man. 'You thought what you was doing was easy and cheap at the price. That must be seen as wrong. 'It is my duty to deter other people from joining in this type of scheme and this type of offending. 'You thought you could buy off justice with corruption. That strikes at the heart of the system and makes a mockery of justice.' All four defendants had denied the charges. The court heard Camello had a previous conviction for conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm. He had wanted to avoid a second driving ban after a previous disqualification for drink driving. Robinson had only learned the day before yesterday’s conviction that he had earned his Bachelor of Science degree. This had now been 'sabotaged by his conviction', said the judge. A number of motorists involved in the scam have already been jailed for committing the same offence and Judge Knowles said he could not make an exception for Robinson. 'They include people with established families, careers, businesses, and people without those things,' he said. 'People of all ages, people in various states of health. Many will not have the opportunity you will have in time to start afresh.' Preston Crown Court, pictured, heard that drivers would pass on cash to 'middle men' who had contacts within the Liverpool underworld and their details would be handed to Kelly. Following sentencing, detective chief inspector Andy O’Connor said: 'The public quite rightly have high expectations of those who work within the criminal justice system. 'Public corruption is an extremely serious offence that undermines public faith in the integrity of those who work in the criminal justice system. 'Public servants are required to act with integrity, honesty, objectivity and impartiality but Kelly’s actions could not have been further from each of these. 'His actions have undermined the criminal justice system and the very laws which he was employed to uphold. 'We are quite clear, no one is above the law, Kelly abused his position and also let down his colleagues who day in, day out provide a professional and quality service to the people of Liverpool. 'The investigation into this matter took more than three years and I would like to thank all of those involved for their hard work in bringing this man to justice.' Fingerprint evidence and a handwriting expert proved that Kelly wrote and submitted numerous documents to the DVLA to request that points be removed from the licences . Dana Gledhill, senior crown prosecutor for CPS North West, said: 'Fingerprint evidence and a handwriting expert proved that Mr Kelly wrote and submitted numerous documents to the DVLA to request that points be removed from the licences. 'Computer evidence showed that he then checked the progress of these requests on the computer system which was linked with the DVLA. 'He was first caught out when points were removed from licences on cases which had not even been sentenced at Liverpool Magistrates’ Court; cases which he had no authority to deal with. 'He abused his position within the court system to commit these offences and his actions and subsequent conviction jeopardise the public’s faith and trust in the criminal justice system. 'The Crown Prosecution Service and the police will seek to bring before the courts all those who commit such offences.'","David Kelly, 47, ran scam from Liverpool Magistrates’ Court .

Mother-of-three Jess Gibbs, 22, gave birth to Alfie in the footwell of the speeding white Ford Transit. Floor layer Daniel, 26, said despite his best efforts to reach the hospital in time his son arrived at a roundabout minutes away from Furness General Hospital, Barrow, Cumbria. Father Daniel then managed to untangle the umbilical cord from around his neck, while still driving. Alfie arrived at 1.10am with the couple were just minutes away from the maternity unit. Baby Alfie Kerr with mother Jess Gibbs and father Daniel Kerr, in the van in which Alfie was dramatically delivered . Jess said that Alfie's rapid arrival caught them both by surprise and he was delivered in the footwell of the van as they sped towards the hospital. Mr Kerr was forced to act when the couple noticed the baby not breathing as the cord had become wrapped around his neck. Jess said: 'I looked at Alfie and he was just blue. I looked at his neck and realised the cord was still around it. 'Daniel managed to untangle it. We didn't have time to stop. It all happened so quickly.' The drama unfolded after Jess woke up at midnight on Wednesday last week with contractions. However she expected her labour to last many hours and did not think there was any rush to reach the hospital. 'It was completely different to how I planned it!' said Jess, of Langdale Crescent, Kendal. 'I keep saying it is one of those things you could never imagine happening to you. It was like something you see on television.' Jess, who had delivered two children before Alfie, had woken up abruptly at 12.05am at home, after feeling sharp, painful contractions, although she was not due to give birth for another two weeks. After ringing Helme Chase maternity unit in Kendal, the couple were told to head to Barrow. 'When they said to go to Barrow, I didn't think I would make it,' said Jess, also mother to Taylor, 6, and Abbey, 5. Despite Daniel's best efforts to reach the hospital in time, Alfie was delivered in the footwell of the moving van . The pains started getting worse. I was cupping myself, I told myself not to push. But then I felt the urge to push. I felt his head come out and then, within seconds, Alfie came out into my hands. My pyjama bottoms caught him.' Little Alfie was born somewhere near the junction between Park Road and Barrow Road. Mr Kerr, 26, a floor layer, said: 'I just keep thinking that it was quite a long way to get to Barrow. It was just mad. Alfie arrived at a roundabout minutes away from Furness General Hospital, Barrow, Cumbria (pictured) 'Jess kept saying ""I'm not going to make it"". I thought she was just exaggerating but then I heard her shouting: ""The baby's coming out, it's coming out!""' After Alfie was delivered and Mr Kerr had managed to unwrap the umbilical cord from round the baby's neck the couple arrived the hospital. Miss Gibbs said: 'I'm just happy everything ended okay.' The couple stayed in Furness General Hospital on Wednesday, being released later that evening, with little Alfie none the worse for his dramatic entrance to the world. Back at home, the family are now able to laugh about their ordeal. 'It's definitely something we can't wait to tell Alfie about when he's older,' said Jess. A white Ford transit van (pictured) is not the usual place for birth, but Alfie is healthy and the couple say they are happy it is all over . Share what you think .

"By . Daniel Martin, Whitehall Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 16:01 EST, 23 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:23 EST, 24 September 2013 . Public confidence in MPs has slumped following the expenses scandal that shook Westminster, with just a fifth now believing most politicians tell the truth. New research reveals that less than a third of the public see MPs as ‘competent’ or dedicated to doing a good job for the public, while almost a half say they are in it for personal gain. The grim picture emerged in the latest research on attitudes for the Committee on Standards in Public Life. Damning: Research has found that only one in five members of the public think most MPs tell the truth . The watchdog has been carrying out the polling every two years since 2004 - and while faith in the judiciary and police has remained solid, the ratings for the political class have slumped. In general, just 59 per cent of the public said they had positive views about standards in public life, compared to 82 per cent in 2008, the year before it emerged that dozens of MPs had misused their expenses. Nine years ago, 31 per cent of the public in England thought all or most MPs told the truth, but by 2010, after the parliamentary allowances crisis, the level had dropped to 20 per cent. It has not risen since. Only around third or 31 per cent thought the majority did not use power for personal gain, with 45 per cent believing they did. But nearly two-thirds said all or most politicians would not take bribes. Results: Latest research on public attitudes for the Committee on Standards in Public Life also showed that 45 per cent of the public thought MPs used their position of power for personal gain . Just 30 per cent of those surveyed believed most MPs were ‘competent’. Although this figure was up marginally from the 2010 figure, it is way down on the 40 per cent recorded in 2004. The survey found only 27 per cent believed MPs were ‘dedicated to doing a good job for the public’ - down from 46 per cent the year before the expenses scandal. Disgrace: The MPs expenses scandal - which saw Derek Conway, pictured, whose payments to his two sons first highlighted the abuse of the MPs expenses system - is the cause of the findings . The proportion convinced that all or most politicians make sure public money is spent wisely was anchored on 18 per cent last year - less than half its 2006 peak of 39 per cent, before the financial crash. In 2004, 42 per cent thought a large majority of MPs set a good example in their private lives, but that fell to 22 per cent in 2010 and 20 per cent in the most recent results. Liberal Democrat supporters tended to have significantly higher confidence in politicians than backers of the other parties. Some 56 per cent expressed trust in their local MP, compared to 46 per cent of potential Labour and Tory voters. But supporters of all parties were more likely to have confidence in their local MP than MPs in general. Dr Mark Philp, chairman of the Committee’s Research Advisory Board, said: ‘The dynamic nature of public perceptions of standards and trustworthiness has two important implications. 'One is that it is short sighted for commentators to dismiss these findings on the basis that “there will always be people who are disaffected or distrustful'. ‘The surveys provide evidence that public perceptions can improve in response to events in the public sphere, as was evident for the period 2004 to 2008. 'There is no reason to assume that individuals who are currently sceptical could not become more hopeful in their perception and evaluation of politics and governance.‘But it does require public officials to be seen as demonstrating the seven principles or public life - selflessness, integrity, objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership.’ Share what you think .

Probe: Lancashire PCC Clive Crunshaw is being investigated by the CPS over expense claims . A police and crime commissioner will have his expenses investigated after allegations he claimed twice as much money for mileage as he deserved. Clive Grunshaw, Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) for Lancashire could face criminal charges depending on the outcome of the probe by the Crown Prosecution Service. Details of Mr Grunshaw's expenses were passed to the CPS by the police watchdog after an internal investigation, and he was today suspended by the Labour Party. The claims relate to before his election as PPC when he was a Labour councillor for Lancashire County Council, and also chairman of Lancashire Police Authority’s resources committee. While holding the positions he is said to have claimed petrol costs between his Fleetwood home and meetings in Preston from both the police and the council, despite only making a single journey. Records allegedly show that 23 doubled-up claims were made, totalling £1,200 for mileage and a further £350 for 'subsistence'. Mr Grunshaw said today he did not ‘wilfully submit claims which I knew to be untrue’ and added that he would continue in his post until a final decision was made by prosecutors. In a statement issued today, Miranda Carruthers-Watt, chief executive and solicitor for the Office for the Police and Crime Commissioner (OPCC), said: ‘This investigation relates to claims made when Clive Grunshaw was subject to the Lancashire County Council expenses and allowance scheme as a Lancashire county councillor and a member of Lancashire Police Authority.

Paul Gascoigne's 'no-show' on This Morning has been denied by a representative who said 'nothing had been agreed' between the show's bosses and the star, who is now in Bournemouth. The 46-year-old, who is reportedly facing a 'daily battle' with alcoholism and has recently attended rehab, had been expected to appear on the ITV show to discuss a documentary about his life and drinking habits. This Morning host Phillip Schofield, 51, . told the show's viewers: ‘He was supposed to be here this morning, but . no one can find him.’ Scroll down for video . Candid: Paul Gascoigne speaks about his 15-year battle with alcoholism and addiction for an ITV documentary . But a representative for Paul Gascoigne . denied he had gone missing and told MailOnline that the star is . currently at home in Bournemouth. He said: 'There had been a . discussion with the This Morning Team on the prospect of Paul coming in . but nothing had formally been agreed and signed off and no transport had . been arranged. 'It was not a question of a no-show.' Sports fan: Paul is pictured with his step-daughter Bianca and ex-wife Sheryl at Windsor Race Course in the documentary . 'He . is now at home in Bournemouth. He's a recovering alcoholic so it's a . daily battle but he's doing fine and keeping in good shape.' An ITV insider told The Mirror that the star had failed to turn up to the show, saying: ‘It became apparent late on Monday he probably wasn’t going to be able to make it. ‘He . couldn’t be located in the morning, or there still would have been time . to get him on air. It’s fair to say he went Awol, which is a concern, . given his condition. 'No-show': Phillip Schofield (pictured with fellow This Morning host Holly Willoughby) told viewers that Paul Gascoigne failed to turn up for the programme . Home life: The documentary delves into the everyday life of the star, who become a global footballing legend and national treasure . ‘There were some fears he might have gone on another bender and not made it back home in time for the show.’ In the documentary, the former Spurs and England player admitted that he knew he ‘would drink again’. The Geordie player was rushed to hospital in February this year and almost died when he suffered a serious reaction after attempting to give up alcohol. He was readmitted to hospital in July after fans found him 'drunk and sick' outside a London hotel. Football star: In his heyday Paul Gascoigne scored Tottenham's first goal directly from a free kick . And Gascoigne was fined £1,000 for a drunken assault on a railway security guard last month. The former midfielder also said he thought he would be better off dead than living with addiction. He said: ‘At least if I did pass away, I wouldn’t be in this pain all the time.’ In the new ITV documentary Gascoigne, 46, is seen having Botox, which he began doing last year as he attempted to embark on a new healthy living regime. Under the syringe: Paul Gascoigne is seen getting botox as part of a new ITV documentary into his life . Over . a three-month period, Paul gave cameras unprecedented access to . his private life for the one-off, ITV documentary, which portrays the . real Paul Gascoigne through his own words and the words of the people . closest to him. The documentary called Being Paul Gascoigne, which aired on Monday night also showed the star rummaging through cupboards full of sweets as a substitute for his alcohol addiction. Gazza admitted on the ITV show that despite his well-publicised attempts at rehab, he . will hit the bottle again and that his alcoholism will kill him. 'I know probably in the future I am going to drink again... and that means a wooden box and six nails,' he tells film maker Jane Preston. Revealing documentary: In the ITV documentary Gascoigne described 'the pain' of knowing he might start drinking again even though he recognises it might kill him . Paul, affectionately known as Gazza, is followed around by cameras as he returns to the UK after being rushed into intensive care in America, after he was too unwell to receive medical care at the rehab centre where a reaction to the treatment nearly killed him. He also told the filmmaker: 'I didn’t ask to be an alcoholic. It’s like asking someone why he is a diabetic. I wish I wasn’t but I am. If I’m having a good day I’ll make the most of it because I don’t know what tomorrow brings, or even the next five minutes.' The film, which ITV admits it paid Gascoigne a fee for, features his family wife Sheryl and children Bianca and Regan and sees them gather together for the first time in years to celebrate his 46th birthday. Family affair: The documentary called Being Paul Gascoigne also features his children Regan Gascoigne and Bianca Gascoigne . A struggle: Paul Gascoigne's sister Anne Marie puts her hand over her mouth as she recalls the difficulties trying to help her brother .

Launch: The Duchess of Cambridge with Captain Tony Draper in Southampton this June during the ceremony where she named Princess Cruises' newest ship, Royal Princess . A cruise ship launched by the Duchess of Cambridge only four months ago has been cursed by severe electrical problems during a voyage around the Mediterranean. Kate named the new vessel ‘Royal Princess’ during a lavish ceremony at Southampton in June when she cut a rope that saw a bottle of champagne being smashed against its hull. But today the ship cut a sad figure as it limped towards Naples just a week into a twelve day £1,200 cruise carrying more than 3,000 passengers who had originally left from Venice on September 15. Passengers are expected to stay on the ship until Tuesday night and then disembark on Wednesday morning as arrangements are currently being made for them to be flown home to a variety of destinations. Today one passenger on the ill-fated cruise told the Daily Mail that problems began on Saturday afternoon when crew members were unable to lift the anchor in at the Greek island of Mykonos. ‘We were stranded there for about four hours until they sorted that out,’ she said. ‘We were told they had eventually repaired and then restarted the motor of the anchor winch. ‘Then on Sunday afternoon the engines just completely stopped which meant many of the lights and lifts did not work for long periods and the air conditioning also failed. ‘I have to add that the crew have been amazing and the restaurant staff have done everything they can to feed people. I think there are some emergency generators on board which have helped.' Today Princess Cruises who are owned by the United States Carnival Corporation and PLC - but who operate the Royal Princess - confirmed there had been a problem with their vessel and promised passengers a full refund and a 25 per cent discount of any future cruise they wish to book. The Royal Princess is the world’s sixth largest passenger ship and weighs in at 141,000 tons. The vessel was built in Italy and is 1,083 feet long and 217 feet high. It has 17 decks and a top speed on 22 knots. State of the art: The ship is the world's sixth largest passenger ship, at 217 feet high with 17 decks . Opulent: The company named Kate 'godmother' of the ship which has a gold-themed atrium off the deck . Carnival confirmed a ‘power outage’ but said power had been restored to the ship which was on its way to Naples, and added: . ‘During the power outrage an emergency back-up generator was used to provide essential services such as toilets. The Captain has been keeping passengers regularly informed about the situation. There are currently 3,594 passengers and 1,336 crew on board.’ The latest problem for the ship comes after Carnival had problems with engine room fires on their vessels Splendor and Triumph which saw both ships having to be towed back to US ports. In February the Carnival ship Triumph had a fire in the engine room which resulted in a loss of power and propulsion. There were no casualties or injuries to passengers or crew. That came after an incident in November 2010 when on the second day of a voyage from Long Beach to the Mexican Riviera the cruise liner also suffered an engine room fire which cut all electrical power. The duchess was heavily pregnant when she cut the ribbon of what was said to be one of the greatest ships . Elaborate prototype images showed high-powered lighting and a dream swimming pool scene in the sunset . Today one passenger on the Royal Princess posted on a Facebook page: ‘The ship had many other problems in the past eight days - plumbing, electrical, air-conditioning and we were delayed leaving Mykonos for over four hours because they couldn’t get the anchor up.’ Another posted a message on the Princess Cruise Facebook page which read: ‘My friends who are currently on board and texting me are not painting as rosy a picture. They said limited power, major repair work required, ship underway max 10 knots, and just got stuck in an elevator when power failed after the power was restored.’ The problems for the ship come after Carnival boasted how the launch ritual involving the Duchess of Cambridge marked ‘the birth of a vessel, and asks for a blessing of good fortune and safety for the ship and its passengers and crew.’ The company added that the most ‘important element of the naming tradition is the Godmother selected to christen a ship. ‘In the mid-19th century it became customary for a woman of distinction to be selected for this honour. A godmother is the symbolic patron, or sponsor, of the ship through its entire life and symbolizes the spirit of the vessel.’ Previous ‘Godmothers’ for Princess Cruise vessel have included the late Diana Princess of Wales - who named the first Royal Princess in 1984 - along with Audrey Hepburn, Sophia Loren, Margaret Thatcher and Olivia de Havilland. Today passengers complained about their ordeal on Facebook after their trip was cut short by five days . Following the ship’s maiden voyage to Barcelona on June 16 the Royal Princess had conducted a further nine cruises this Summer and was due to begin visits to the Eastern Caribbean later this year. This evening a statement from Princess Cruises said: ‘Passengers will be provided with a full refund of their cruise fare, along with a 25 per cent future cruise credit. Princess is making homeward air arrangements for passengers. ‘We have dispatched a care team to Naples to ensure that all our passengers are provided with any assistance they may require. ‘The impact of the repairs on the next Royal Princess cruise, scheduled to depart from Barcelona on September 27, is not yet known and we will keep passengers fully advised as details become known. Once again, we are deeply sorry for this unanticipated disruption of our passengers’ holiday plans, and we appreciate their patience and understanding of these circumstances.’ Carnival’s Italian subsidiary operated the ill-fated Costa Concordia which ran aground off the island of Giglio in January 2012 and was only winched upright last week.","Plumbing and electrical problems forced captain to cut 12-day trip short after just one week .

When it came to chucking-out time at Downing Street parties, it was my job to make sure all the guests actually left. No matter how many glasses they’d had, you didn’t want people walking past desks with confidential papers and taking a peek. On occasion, though, I had the opposite role, standing at the exit holding back furious journalists and civil servants trying to make last orders at the Red Lion on the grounds that Newsnight was still broadcasting live outside and half of them couldn’t stand up. Champagne time: A social gathering on the Commons Terrace; but for others it can spiral out of control . Alcohol is integral to the culture of Westminster and Whitehall, McBride claims . Westminster is the binge-drinking . capital of Britain. Compared with now, I look back at the way I lived . then with disbelief. At the time, though, I couldn’t believe my luck. By . the age of 25, when I was working as a civil servant for Customs before . being taken on by Gordon, I was already — by any measure — an . alcoholic. I used to walk past Smithfield Market in London at 7 am and . often conclude that it made perfect sense for me to do my paperwork in . one of the 24-hour bars rather than at my desk. When I landed a job at the Treasury, life became more complicated. I had to be on call for ministers at any time, and the day was usually so busy with meetings that I couldn’t just slope off to the pub. So my daily routine became a quick two pints while going out ‘to get a sandwich’ at lunchtime, two hours in the pub with colleagues straight after work, then back to the Treasury with a six-pack to do another three hours’ work. I’d have a can on the Tube and another four at home, before falling asleep on the sofa. Occasionally, I’d arrive at the Treasury knowing I’d done three hours’ work the previous night — but not remembering what it was. As time went on, my choice of alcohol was largely unchanged — lager and white wine, usually at the same time — but my levels of consumption grew ever worse. It certainly didn’t help that my role as Gordon’s spin doctor only really required me to be at the end of a phone both to him and the media. Or that I was practically encouraged to take journalists for boozy lunches, long afternoons in the pub and late-night karaoke sessions. The occasions when I couldn’t remember the previous night’s events became more frequent and more worrying. Once, I tried to obtain entry to the Treasury at 2 am and had a rambling row with the custodian — only for his supervisor to come down and tell me I was outside the Foreign Office. In September 2003, on one of my first overseas trips as the Treasury’s head of communications, we all gathered at the end of the day in the recreation room at the British embassy in Dubai to watch Arsenal v Manchester United. I sat down with 15 cans of beer and started drinking at a ridiculous pace. When Ruud Van Nistelrooy missed a penalty, I jumped up and yelled at the screen: ‘Have that, you ****** ********! You cheating ******!’  It was only then that I realised quite how many children were in the room, as well as the ambassador and his family. There was one man who always resisted alcohol, one politician who exemplified dipso-discipline ¿ and that was Gordon Brown, his former spin doctor says . Gordon looked horrified, Ed Balls rather amused. And yet I can barely remember anyone in my entire time in the civil service or politics taking me to one side and telling me to take it easy. That’s partly because alcohol is so integral to the culture of Westminster and Whitehall, that while I was seen as a big drinker, I wasn’t totally beyond the norm. When Freddie Flintoff famously peed in the flowerbeds at a No. 10 reception for the 2005 Ashes victors, the reaction of many hardened Westminster drinkers was: ‘Sounds a bit tame.’ Indeed, it’s no exaggeration to say that I’d still be an alcoholic if I’d remained in my job. Who could avoid the summer and Christmas parties when politicians and government departments always bought far more booze than was necessary? Booze that, naturally, everyone felt they had to finish off. But there was one man who always resisted, one politician who exemplified dipso-discipline — and that was Gordon. He was quite capable of nursing the same glass of wine for two hours at a Downing Street reception. Despite this, he showed tremendous tolerance when I missed morning meetings or flights to Brussels, and fell over or dropped glasses at receptions. Once, in front of half the Treasury staff, I’d had a one-sided physical altercation with a civil servant during a quiz night, and Gordon was told to speak to me about it. Power Trip, the book by former Labour spin doctor Damian McBride, reveals all in his new book . Bashfully, he addressed me about controlling my temper — but mentioned nothing about the fact I was drunk. On the odd occasion when he came into my office late at night, he’d even manage to ignore the eight empty cans of lager on the desk. But that was because no matter how far gone I might be, I retained the ability to talk to him coherently and authoritatively about what was in tomorrow’s papers and what our line should be. Except once, in 2006. I’d just returned from a friend’s stag do in Riga, which had ended with a Sunday football match at Old Trafford — so I’d been drinking for 36 hours. Gordon called at the end of the game and asked me what was going to be in the papers. I barely knew what day it was. Staggering through a beer garden, I rambled incoherently and then shouted: ‘It’s words. It’s words. Just words. Written in ink. It’s just ink, Gordon.’ My friends from the stag do were sitting on the wall of the pub, killing themselves laughing. ‘Mm-hmm, I see,’ said Gordon. Then he added gently: ‘And, erm, what will be in the Telegraph?’ He kept up the conversation for ten minutes, working his way through every paper and letting me dig myself ever deeper into the hole. Finally, he said: ‘Well, thank you, Damian. Get back to your . . . ah . . . celebrations.’ Gordon wasn’t averse to some reflected glory when it suited him. In 2009, the celebrities who’d climbed Mount Kilimanjaro for Comic Relief were invited to a No 10 reception with local schoolchildren and, while there was a great cast list due to attend, the real star was Cheryl Cole. Cheryl and Girls Aloud bandmate Kimberley Walsh were very late to the event, meaning Gordon Brown - and a very annoyed Gary Barlow - had to wait . There was an art to timing Gordon’s . arrival at these things. We’d keep all the celebrities who arrived early . in a holding room and tell them they’d be going into the main reception . just as soon as Gordon had finished his phone call with the Israeli . Prime Minister — always our default excuse when we wanted to say he was . busy.

Especially Gary Barlow. Eventually, the back gates of Downing Street swung open, a swanky car pulled in and one of the guards gave a thumbs-up. We got Gordon down straight away and he marched into the holding room, apologising profusely to the other celebrities for the wait and just giving time for Cheryl magically to arrive right on cue behind him. Except she didn’t. There was still no Cheryl. ‘Can we just hold on, everyone,’ I said. ‘We just need to warn the kids upstairs that you’re coming up.’ We didn’t really. They were getting almost as bored of waiting as the celebrities, but we needed some excuse for the extra delay. Colleagues went running all round the building looking for where Cheryl and Kimberley had got to, and one eventually rushed up and whispered that they were on their way. One of our most star-struck special advisers had intercepted them at the back door and taken them for a quick look round the Cabinet room. I mentally started revving up my chainsaw, but said calmly: ‘Oh Gordon, apparently two other guests have just arrived — so let’s just hold on for them.’ The eventual moment of Gordon walking in with Cheryl to the screams of the kids was great — apart, that is, from Gary Barlow scowling in the background.

Nurses at a Cleveland hospital have surprised a lung transplant patient and his fiancee by organizing them a wedding - a month after the couple was forced to cancel their nuptials when a donor became available. Doug Smith, a police officer with life-threatening pulmonary fibrosis, was just a week from marrying girlfriend Susan when they got the call that the hospital had a lung for him. They canceled the church wedding and left their Zanesville, Ohio home for the Cleveland Clinic's Transplant Center, where 42-year-old Smith underwent the life-saving surgery just days later. But exactly a month after he was given his new lung, hospital staff gave him another gift: A surprise wedding on the rooftop in front of relatives and staff members. Special day: Hospital staff provided Doug and Susan Smith with a veil, flowers, food and a cake so that they could get married. A month earlier, they had called off their wedding so he could undergo a transplant . Susan had cleared the on-site wedding with the hospital chaplain as the marriage license was about to expire - but they had no idea about the rest of the plans, or the lengths the nurses had gone to. 'The next thing you know there was a . roomful of nurses with pen and paper, running in and out of the room, . deciding among themselves that they would take care of everything,' she told ABC News. 'It was amazing - they were so excited. It . was very emotional.' Nurses gave the couple a bouquet of . daisies, one even gave them her own veil to use and another, who was a consultant for the cosmetics company Mary Kay, . brought in a case of make-up. They provided food that had been donated by Starbucks and Au Bon Pain and bought a cake. Staff also created a sign for the back of Smith's wheelchair reading: 'He got his lungs, she got his heart.' Susan added that she wore a white dress she already had, which she wore with flip flops after her daughter forgot to bring her shoes. Scene: They were married on the roof of the Cleveland Clinic, pictured, surrounded by family and staff . Smith, who has never smoked, first knew something was wrong in 2011 when he started suffer asthma-like symptoms that left him tired and struggling to breathe. He was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis, which scars the tissues on the lungs, and placed on the lung transplant list on June 18. As his condition was so severe, he was placed in the top 10 per cent of patients and got a call just three days later. People suffering from pulmonary fibrosis often live between two to five years after they are diagnosed, but medical staff told ABC the transplant means he could live for 20 more years. Dr. Marie Budev, medical director of Cleveland Clinic's Lung Transplantation Program, said that his operation had not been easy and he still had a lot of recovering to do, but that she was hopeful he would recover well due to his age. 'If they are younger and their other . organs are younger, they are able to sustain a lot of the toxic effects . from the immune suppressive drugs they are on for the rest of their . life,' she told ABC. She added that the wedding had lifted everyone's spirits. 'We had never had a wedding after a . transplant like this - it was special for us,' she said. 'Despite the . terrible things that happen, life goes on.' The couple, who have been together for five years, have three teenage children between them. His wife has returned to work at Home Depot and her new husband is hopeful he will also go back to work one day. They are also planning a benefit to help pay for medical bills.","Doug and Susan Smith, from Zanesville, Ohio, called off their wedding just a week before they were supposed to walk down the aisle .

Basil the African Grey parrot should have been a prized exotic addition to any pet lover's home. However, his new owners' pride soon turned to shock after he began hurling swear words at them - in a Welsh accent. Sarah Fisk, 34, was thrilled when she brought Basil back to her house in Bristol and he greeted her with a polite 'hello'. That was where the niceties ended, . however, as the bird began chirruping a string of expletives before . telling her, 'I'm in the Valleys.' Sarah and Adam Fisk were left stunned when Basil the African Grey Parrot began swearing at them in a Welsh accent just hours after arriving at their home in Bristol . The care worker said: 'It was quite shocking the first time he did it. I didn’t quite believe my ears. He settled in so quickly and was obviously making himself at home. ‘His accent is so strong sometimes that we aren’t sure what he is saying, but it definitely sounds Welsh. And when he says the swear words, that is in a distinctive Welsh accent.’ Basil had previously lived in the Vale of Glamorgan, and his owners had admitted to Mrs Fisk that he had picked up some colourful language. Proud Polly: Basil the parrot remained true to his Welsh roots by declaring to his new owners: 'I'm in the Valleys' The mother-of-three adds: 'His previous owners had said he had sworn in the past, but I thought that a change of scenery would leave that behind - not a chance.' The parrot, originally native to the rainforests of West and Central Africa, then caused Sarah and her husband Adam, 39, even more trouble when he escaped out of a window while they were cleaning his cage. After launching a missing poster campaign, the couple found Basil safe and well three days later at a nearby vets, where he had a new target for his foul-mouthed rants. Mandy Stone, veterinary manager at the RSPCA Bristol Clinic, said: ‘He kept calling the nurses t*****s and there were a few other phrases he used that I won’t repeat. It was quite shocking. The bolshy bird caused more trouble for his new owners after escaping. He turned up at a nearby vets, where he had also targeted nurses with his foul mouth . ‘He was very quiet and shy for the first day, but then all of a sudden he started talking and rather surprised us with his adult vocabulary. ‘He also whistled the McDonalds tune and he danced for us when we asked him to, so we forgave his bad manners.’ Despite the nurses eventually coming round to Basil's lewd ways, Mrs Fisk admits the debacle left her red-faced. She adds: 'I had to apologise for his bad manners when I collected him. It seems that when he is being left on his own away from humans he gets quite angry and swears even more. ‘He doesn’t like to be ignored, especially if you are eating something he likes, like chocolate. He just says ‘chocolate, chocolate, chocolate’ over and over until you give him some. He loves the stuff. ‘He gets quite upset if you say no. He really can be a diva.’","Basil the parrot began hurling expletives hours after moving into his new home in Bristol .

Tim Rice has said he may no longer vote for the Tories because of David Cameron’s enthusiasm for ‘hideous’ wind farms. The lyricist said that he could have made more than £1million from offers to put turbines on his Scottish estate, but believes green energy schemes are a ‘scam’. Sir Tim, 68, who was once a high profile support of the Conservative Party, said its wind-farm policy has made him unsure how he will vote. ‘Wind farms are one of the most dishonest scams perpetuated by any organisation ever,’ he told Country Life. Sir Tim Rice (left) has admitted he is unsure if he will vote for the Tories in the future due to Prime Minister David Cameron's wind-farm policy . ‘They don’t work, are hideous to look at, destroy birds and bats, are bad for people’s health and put up people’s bills. He added: ‘We have some land in Scotland and we were asked to put wind turbines on it. I could have made £1million or more out of it with all the grants and so forth- it is an absolute racket.’ The UK is currently signed up to a legally binding European Union renewable energy target requiring it to produce about 15 per of its energy from renewable sources by 2020. Sir Tim’s criticism came as a Church of England bishop said no more wind farms should be allowed in the countryside as they are a ‘blot’ on ‘God’s creation’. Scam: Sir Tim reveals he could have made £1 million from wind turbines on his land in Scotland, but has dismissed the renewable energy initiative as an 'absolute racket' Bishop of Newcastle the Right Reverend Martin Wharton said he has a Christian duty to protect the beautiful landscapes in his diocese from ‘becoming marred and disfigured’. Breaking ranks with an unofficial consensus within the Church strongly favouring wind energy, the 69-year-old said there are ‘critical questions’ about if turbines will even reduce carbon emissions. In a letter to a local newspaper, the bishop said that having spent time touring his diocese, which included Northumberland, he had been unable not to notice the growing number of wind farms. ‘It is a basic Christian truth that we all have a duty and a responsibility to care for and exercise wise stewardship over God’s creation, which has been entrusted to us,’ he wrote. Fan: Prime Minister David Cameron put his money where his mouth is by having a wind turbine erected at his West London home in 2007 . ‘Our countryside needs to be protected and preserved for ourselves, for our children and for our grandchildren as a place of refreshment and renewal for the spiritual health and wellbeing of us all. ‘The danger is that in parts of Northumberland, our landscape is becoming marred and disfigured and turned into one industrial site after another.’ Referencing the Northumbrian saints such as Bede, Cuthbert and Hilda in his letter to the Newcastle Journal, he continued: ‘We are blessed to live in an area of outstanding natural beauty. ‘We enjoy a wonderful physical and spiritual heritage in this land of the Northern Saints. ‘Is now not the time to say “enough” to any further blots on our landscape? Please remember above all that “The earth is the Lord’s, and all that fills it” Psalm 24.’ He added: ‘Whilst we all recognise the need for a greater reliance on sources of renewable energy, there are critical questions to be asked not only about the efficiency of wind turbines in general but also about the massive environmental impact that the significant growth and cumulative effect that wind farms are having in Northumberland. ‘There is no evidence that I have seen that suggests that wind farms will ever provide the reliable, controllable energy that is required by our society, however many there might be. ‘Furthermore some studies have even suggested that far from reducing CO2 emissions, wind farms actually increase them.’ Sir Tim, who co-wrote Jesus Christ Superstar, Evita and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat with Andrew Lloyd Webber, owns the 33,000-acre Dundonnell estate in Wester Ross on the west coast of Scotland. The Oscar-winning songwriter is worth £149million according the Sunday Times Rich List.","Sir Tim slammed Conservative's wind-farm policy as 'an absolute racket'

A mountain climber was left stunned when he reached the summit of Mount Snowdon to see an incredible circular rainbow. Sam Clack, 33, had spent four hours scaling the highest peak in Wales when he saw the stunning sight. He looked over the ridge and saw the Brocken spectre - the name given to the rare phenomenon. Ghostly glow: The Brocken spectre shone around hiker Sam Clack at the top of Mount Snowdon . Brocken spectres appear when the sun shines behind a person in a way that causes their shadow to be cast on the upper surfaces of clouds that appear opposite the sun. Depth perception is affected by the mist and the resulting optical illusion means the person's shadow appears magnified. Light diffracts in the mist surrounding them - causing the rainbow effect. Brocken spectres get their name from the Brocken, a peak in the Harz mountain range in Germany where the phenomenon was first identified, and where it is particularly common due to the frequent fogs there - and the popularity of the region among hikers. It can only occur when the sun is directly behind the observer's back, and when the fog behind them is thick enough and contains enough water droplets to make the effect visible. Shadow man: Diffracted light in the mist and a low sun formed the essential conditions for the optical illusion to occur . Stunned: A retired physics teacher explained to Mr Clack (pictured above) what had made his shadow seem so ethereal . This means they are only seen in mists at high altitude when the sun is low - although aeroplanes also often create Brocken spectres when they fly over sheets of cloud at sun-level. In Mr Clack's case, the sun was behind him and projected his down onto the thick fog, creating the colourful, halo-like mane. Mr Clack, a radio journalist from Manchester, said a retired physics teacher he met at the top of the mountain when he climbed it this weekend explained to him that he had caused a Brocken spectre - though only 'when he'd lifted his jaw from the floor', Mr Clack said. 'I have never seen one before and may never see another. It was definitely a privilege to have witnessed it,' he said. Rare treat: Mr Clack was lucky to see the phenomenon, which can only occur if the conditions are exactly right .","Amateur climber Sam Clack sees rare optical illusion in mist .

For anyone who dreams of a life changing lottery win, heed the words of recent syndicate winner ‘Wild’ Willie Seeley from Manahawkin, New Jersey. ‘The drama is nonstop,’ warns Willie, who has revealed that he and wife Donna long for their older, simpler lives back. Back in August, he and 15 co-workers from the Ocean County Vehicle Maintenance Center shared one of three winning tickets for a $450 million Powerball jackpot prize. Scroll down for video . 'Wild' Willie Seeley from Manahawkin, New Jersey, was one of the 'Ocean's 13' who shared part of a $450 million Powerball jackpot prize last month - he now he says he regrets being so public about the win . The ‘Ocean's 16’ celebrated their win at a press conference where Willie was the star of the show. Sporting a floppy straw hat covered in fishing lures, a T-shirt promoting the popular A&E reality show Duck Dynasty, camouflage pants, sun glasses and a long beard, Willie gleefully proclaimed that he and his co-workers were ‘very happy, happy, happy.’ ‘This is my best outfit,’ he jokingly said of his casual getup. Willie’s natural charm caught the eye of the TV networks and the next morning he and Donna appeared on the TODAY show, where he pledged he was going to spend his days fishing, hunting and generally do whatever he pleased. He now admits that all that TV exposure was a big mistake as his high profile meant he was quickly inundated with visits not only from long-lost relatives and beggars, but also from what felt like every reality TV producer in the country. Leave me alone! 'Wild' Willie Seeley says he has been hounded by long-lost relatives, beggars and reality TV producers since winning the lottery last month . Willie said he had to buy a .357 magnum shotgun ‘for protection’ and pointed it at the last people who came knocking on his door. The visits have since stopped, but Willie says his phone hasn’t stopped ringing with offers from the likes of National Geographic, A&E and Ryan Seacrest Productions - all keen to follow his every move with their cameras. ‘Would you want a camera following you around all day when you finally have the time to go hunting and fishing and do all the things you wanted to do?’ he told NBC News. ‘They put me in the National Enquirer, next to Faith Hill and Tim McGraw. I mean I ain’t into all that.’ ‘There are days I wish we were back to just getting paid every two weeks,’ he said. ‘You have to change your whole way of life, but we didn’t want to change the way we lived. We liked the way we lived.’ Wife Donna has gone as far as to call their lottery win-fall as ‘the curse,’ but the couple wouldn’t be giving the money back and have already spent much of it. After taxes, Seeley’s share amounted to just under $4 million, which, he said ‘ain’t s*** in today’s economy.’ That didn't stop both him and his wife from leaving their jobs and buying new cars. They’ve also paid off their mortgage and put a new roof on their home which had been battered by Hurricane Sandy last year. Seeley has also been sure to help other family members. He funded a second round of chemotherapy for his father who is now recovering, he helped one son buy a house and another to start a master’s degree. Back at the press conference in August Willie also said that he was going to buy ‘a log cabin on multiple acres of land.’ 'Just disappear': Willie plans to move to a remote log cabin next month, full-time, so he can spent more time pursuing his passion for hunting and fishing - and also avoid people hounding him . He plans to move to his remote cabin next month, full-time, so he can spent more time pursuing his passion for hunting and fishing - and conveniently avoiding people. Last week a South Carolina man won $400 million on the Powerball at a Lexington gas station after only going in to buy hot dog buns. ‘Just disappear,’ is Willie's advice. ‘Get lost while you still can.’ Perhaps wisely in view of Willie’s experience, that lucky winner has chosen to remain anonymous.","'Wild' Willie Seeley was part of the 'Ocean's 13' syndicate which won a share of a $450 Powerball jackpot last month .

Arrested: Mariano Barbosa Jr., pictured, has been accused of lighting eight fires at two celebrity-filled Manhattan hotels he worked at in a bid to make the venues less busy . A security guard has been accused of lighting eight fires at two celebrity-filled Manhattan hotels he worked at in a bid to make the venues less busy. Mariano Barbosa Jr. allegedly lit the fires over four years at the SoHo Grand on West Broadway, where past guests include Reece Witherspoon, George Clooney and Kirsten Dunst, and the Yotel on 10th Avenue and 42nd Street. The 30-year-old married father-of-three was arrested on Saturday and appeared in Manhattan Criminal Court that evening on arson, reckless endangerment and criminal mischief charges. Fire marshalls said Barbosa, of New Jersey, set the fires in an attempt to make the hotels less popular and his job more manageable. To maximize potential damage, he allegedly started the fires in hallways, in stairwells and in front of exit doors when he was on duty between 10:11 p.m. and 5:09 a.m. All fires were quickly extinguished. No one was seriously hurt in any of the eight fires, though two firefighters sustained minor injuries in a fire in February, according to the Fire Department's director of public information Jim Long. For the first blaze, in February 2009, he set fire to bedding while working at the SoHo Grand. At the Yotel, Barbosa used a towel in three separate incidents and bed sheets in two others from October 2011 to this month, according to court documents. Long said Barbosa was arrested after he submitted to voluntary questioning and information he gave suggested he was the likely culprit. SoHo Grand: Barbosa Jr. allegedly lit the fires at the SoHo Grand, pictured, on West Broadway, where past guests include Reece Witherspoon, George Clooney and Kirsten Dunst . Yotel: He also set fires at the Yotel on 10th Avenue and 42nd Street, pictured, where he worked as director of security . An unnamed official told The New York Times it appeared Barbosa had grown tired of patrons at the hotels' bars and parties. 'He desired that the incidents would be blamed on the clientele, and if that was the case maybe they would curtail the parties, and the venues would be more manageable,' the official said. Yotel said in was cooperating with the Fire Department and the police while the Soho Grand declined to comment to The Times. In a statement, fire commissioner Salvatore J. Cassano said: 'It's disturbing that an individual charged with the safety of hotel occupants would callously endanger their lives — and the lives of firefighters — for personal gain.' Famous faces: Past guests at the SoHo Grand include George Clooney, right, and Kirsten Dunst, left . The security guard's wife, Leslie Martinez, 27, said she was shocked by the charges. She said her husband worked hard for Yotel, which gave him a service award last year that included a four-day trip to Las Vegas. She said he often slept in complimentary rooms, so he could be there for his next shift. 'This is a slap in the face,' Martinez told The Times. 'I don't understand how all of the sudden he's the bad guy.' The couple have been married 12 years and have three young sons, two of them autistic. 'For them to turn this around on him is completely unfair,' Martinez said.","Mariano Barbosa Jr. allegedly lit the fires over four years at the SoHo Grand on West Broadway, where past guests include Reece Witherspoon and George Clooney .

The actor who plays Gordon on Sesame Street has been ordered to continue paying palimony to the mother of his four children after he made an unwritten promise to provide for her for the rest of her life. Roscoe Orman, 71, split with Sharon Joiner-Orman, 61, in March 2010 after 39 years together and married another woman two years later. At that point he cut off the $3,600 in monthly support he had been paying her. When her landlord threatened to evict her from the Montclair home they previously shared, Joiner-Orman sued Orman, claiming he vowed to support her for life after she sacrificed her own career so he could become a 'Sesame Street' fixture for nearly four decades. Forced to pay: Roscoe Orman, 71, pictured, split with Sharon Joiner-Orman, 61, in March 2010 after 39 years together and has been ordered to continue paying support . Last month, Superior Court Judge Ned Rosenberg in Newark ruled in Joiner-Orman's favor, in what appears to be the first ruling of its kind, the New Jersey Star-Ledger reported. Rosenberg said Orman must continue paying palimony even though the unmarried couple had never agreed to anything in writing. A hearing next week will determine how much Orman owes. 'The court finds the plaintiff (Joiner) has fully performed her end of the bargain,' Rosenberg wrote, according to the newspaper. 'In addition, there is no way to qualify the value of the services plaintiff provided over the course of 39 years much less the value of foregone educational and work related opportunities. What is more, the defendant does not deny the agreement and even acknowledged the obligation by deeds and words.' On the Sesame Street website, Orman's character Gordon is described as 'a strong male role model' who is married to Susan and father of Miles. 'Susan and Gordon have been happily married for many year, providing a good example of a successful and united family.' Gordon: On the Sesame Street website, Orman's character Gordon, pictured with Elmo, is described as 'a strong male role model' and his relationship with wife Susan provides 'a good example of a successful family' But Orman left his real-life partner in 2010, moving out of their four-bedroom home. He continued paying Joiner-Orman $3,600 in monthly support payments, while encouraging her to move into a smaller place, Rosenberg wrote in his ruling. Orman paid her other support, including $5,000 in legal fees in October 2012. But in late December 2012, he cut off support when he married, the ruling states. Joiner-Orman’s attorney, Charles Cohen, says the couple, while unmarried, had made a lifelong commitment to one another. 'They were in all respects husband and wife,' Cohen said. Orman even refered to Joiner-Orman as his wife in a memoir he dedicated to her called 'Sesame Street Dad: Evolution of an Actor.' 'To my wife, Sharon Joiner-Orman, thanks for providing this story and my life with true meaning,' he wrote. New wife: Orman, pictured wit new wife Kimberley LaMarque Orman, cut off payments to Joiner-Orman in later December 2012, after he was married . But Orman's attorney, Thomas McDonough, said he would appeal the decision, claiming it 'violates the purpose and language' of a 2010 amendment to state law that requires palimony agreements be agreed in writing under the advice of attorneys. Rosenberg's ruling is believed to be the first of its kind in New Jersey. 'Where it is found that an oral agreement was made, and one party has performed, the contract will be enforced if to do otherwise would work an inequity on the party who has performed,' the judge wrote. Brian Schwartz of The New Jersey State Bar Association, which opposed the amendment when it was introduced, welcomed the ruling. 'To think that some amendment is going to nullify 39 years together, that does not seem fair' he said. 'It's not fair to the person who relied on that promise.' Joiner-Orman has moved out of the Montclair home and is living with her daughter, her lawyer told the Star-Ledger.","New Jersey actor Roscoe Orman, 71, who is best known as Gordon on the kids show, split with Sharon Joiner-Orman, 61, in March 2010 .

Epstein served 13 months of an 18 month sentence for soliciting a 14-year-old for prostitution. In court papers, the victim was only identified as 'Jane Doe.' At one point, Epstein was facing 10 years to life on multiple sex offenses, The Post reported. Court documents in that case claimed he routinely sought out underage girls and paid them $200 to $1,000 for sexual massages in his homes in Palm Beach, Florida, and Manhattan. But the financier avoided a longer possible sentence after he signed a secret non-prosecution deal under which the government agreed to drop its investigation into the string of sex-crime allegations if Epstein confessed to prostitution felonies in Florida state court. Epstein settled more than a dozen lawsuits brought by underage girls since his sentence, with many recieving payouts in excess of $1 million. In 2011, a New York judge ruled Epstein should be listed as a level 3 sex-offender - the highest and most dangerous level. This was despite the millionaire joking to The Post that his crimes were comparable to 'stealing a bagel.'","The former hedgefunder was 'hugging (Allen) and taking close to his ear' in Manhattan on Sunday, a source told The New York Post .

A refused signature and political allegiances have reportedly led to former Vice President Dick Cheney’s wife telling a former Senator to ‘shut up’. Former Wyoming Senator Alan Simpson said that he believes Lynne Cheney snapped at him because he previously denied her granddaughter his signature on a football that was going to be used to raise money for cancer organizations. The Cheneys' daughter, Liz Cheney, has galvanized Wyoming's political scene by seeking the seat of U.S. Senator Mike Enzi, a Republican favored by his party's establishment. Simpson supports Enzi. Petty: Former Wyoming Senator Alan Simpson said Lynne Cheney snapped at him . Power couple: Lynne is married to Dick Cheney, who served as George W. Bush's vice president . Simpson told the Casper Star-Tribune on Tuesday that the disagreement with Lynne Cheney began a couple of weeks ago, at a fundraising event in Laramie for the University of Wyoming Art Museum. Simpson said the Cheneys overheard his wife say during the event that the couple was backing Enzi. At the same event, Liz Cheney's daughter presented a football to dignitaries and asked them to sign it. Lynne Cheney says the football was to be used to raise money for cancer patients but Simpson said he declined to sign it after the teen said she didn't know if it was going to be used for campaign purposes. 'And that's when Lynne and (Liz's staffer) said, “Do you think we would use it for a political fundraiser?” I said, “I don't know. That has happened several times in my life.” And that obviously set off something,' Simpson said. Splitting support: Liz Cheney (pictured) is running to oust current Republican Senator Mike Enzi . The latest exchange took place before a fundraiser for the Buffalo Bill Center of the West where both Simpson and Dick Cheney serve as board members. 'She just said, 'Shut up,'' Simpson said Tuesday of Lynne Cheney. 'You can just read into it what you want to. I don't know what she meant. She was very intense.' Liz Cheney's campaign staff emailed a statement Tuesday night from Lynne Cheney, saying her exchange with Simpson was not about Enzi. 'It was about Al's blowup ... in Laramie, when my 15-year-old granddaughter asked him to sign a football to be used to raise money for cancer patients in Rock Springs,' Lynne Cheney said in the statement. 'Al was rude to my granddaughter, and I told him he was out of line. The topic was not Mike Enzi.' Liz Cheney's campaign, coming just a year after she and her family moved to Wyoming from Virginia, has struck some in this heavily Republican state as a presumptuous attempt to cash in on her famous name. Taking after dad: Liz has worked in the State Department and as a political pundit before launching her bid to oust the sitting Republican Senator from Wyoming Mike Enzi . Many in the Republican establishment have publicly sided with Enzi, the state's senior senator now running for his fourth term. Enzi, the former mayor of Gillette and a former Wyoming legislator, succeeded Simpson in the U.S. Senate. Simpson said he didn't know if he would do any stumping for Enzi on the campaign trail. 'It's a deep-, deep-, deep-rooted friendship,' Simpson said. 'I didn't have that friendship with Liz.' But Simpson also said he's been friends with Dick Cheney for 45 years. 'I'm not out to hurt anyone,' Simpson said. 'That's not who I am. But I am a guy who states his case. And when I was asked about this, I said, “I am sad, and I remain sad.”'","Lynne Cheney, the wife of former Vice President Dick Cheney, insulted former Senator Alan Simpson .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 15:44 EST, 25 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:51 EST, 25 September 2013 . Government agents acting without authorization conducted dozens of undercover investigations of illegal tobacco sales, misused some of $162 million in profits from the stings and lost track of at least 420 million cigarettes, the Justice Department's inspector general said Wednesday. In one case, agents for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives sold $15 million in cigarettes and later turned over $4.9 million in profits from the sales to a confidential informant — even though the agency did not properly account for the transaction. The ATF's newly-appointed director, B. Todd Jones, said the audit covered only selected, 'historical' ATF investigations between 2006 and 2011, and said the agency had tightened its internal guidelines since then. Misuse: The ATF says the agency misused some of $162 million in profits from stings including overpaying an informant by millions of dollars and lost track of at least 420 million cigarettes. Questions to answer: B. Todd Jones, director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The organization mounted dozens of undercover investigations into illicit cigarette sales without proper approval . The audit described widespread lack of ATF oversight and inadequate paperwork in the agency's 'churning investigations,' undercover operations that use proceeds from illicit cigarette sales to pay for the ATF's costs. The audit came as a new blow to a beleaguered agency still reeling from congressional inquiries into the ATF's flawed handling of the Operation Fast and Furious weapons tracking probes in Mexico. 'ATF's guidance regarding churning investigations lacked breadth and specificity, and managers at ATF headquarters as well as managers and special agents at ATF field offices often disregarded it,' Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz wrote in the 53-page audit. The inspector general recommended tightened ATF procedures for documenting, tracking and reviewing proceeds from its undercover tobacco stings. Change for the better: The ATF says it has instituted more stringent controls and restrictions' on how money is used . Jones said the agency has adopted most of those guidelines. While accepting responsibility for 'management and oversight lapses that allowed those deficiencies to develop,' he insisted that 'the report's findings do not reflect current ATF policy or practice in this area.' In a written response, Horowitz approved the ATF's moves in April 2013 to tighten its standards. Horowitz cautioned that his office 'has not been provided evidence to verify the sufficiency of actions taken.' Reviewing three-dozen ATF undercover cigarette stings between 2006 and 2011, the inspector general found that none of those income-generating probes had been given proper prior approval by an internal ATF review committee, as required by agency policy. In the past: The ATF's new director, B. Todd Jones, said the audit covered only selected ATF investigations between 2006 and 2011, and that the agency had tightened its internal guidelines since then . One of those sting operations did not have any approval, either from the ATF or the Justice Department. In that 2009 case, ATF officials allowed a tobacco distributor working as an ATF confidential informant to keep $4.9 million in profits from cigarette sales to criminal suspects. ATF officials justified the move by explaining the $4.9 million covered the informant's expenses. But the inspector general said the agency failed to 'require the informant to provide adequate documentation to support or justify those expenses.' The remaining profits were used by agency officials to pay for a separate ATF cigarette smuggling sting — which the inspector general said violated ATF rules that profits from a 'churning investigation' could only be used to fund that specific operation, not other cases. The inspector general said shoddy documentation and inventory controls made it impossible to account for more than 2.1 million cartons of cigarettes — totaling 420 million cigarettes — during at least 20 separate ATF sting operations. The watchdog estimated the retail value of those items at $127 million.","Inspector general faulted ATF for 'a serious lack' of management .

Starbucks could soon be adding an extra fizz to its customers' drinks as it files a trademark name for the range of carbonated drinks it has been testing. The experiment with carbonated beverages is a bit like giving customers the chance to have their order put through a Soda Stream. Zack Hutson, a Starbucks spokesman, said the application is related to a new range it started experimenting with at stores in Atlanta and Austin in June. Refreshing change: Starbucks has been experimenting with carbonated drinks . The Seattle-based coffee company is registering the name Fizzio, which would apply to drinks machines and the beverages they provide, it said in its U.S. Patent and Trademark Office application. Three fizzy flavors - Lemon Ale, Original Ginger Ale and Spiced Root Beer - have been on offer to customers, who were also given the chance to carbonate iced teas and coffees for no extra charge, the Huffington Post reported. 'So far the response from customers in the test markets has been positive,' Mr Hutson said. Melody, a coffee lover in Seattle who writes blogs about new drinks products, visited one of the shops testing the carbonated drinks and liked what she saw. 'This was crazy good. Since I knew I wasn’t going to be able to easily return to this Starbucks, I drank two Venti Starbucks root beers! I just couldn’t stop,' she wrote on Starbucks Melody. 'It’s sweet, refreshing, and a lovely distinctive root beer flavor ... Starbucks root beer solidly gets two thumbs up from me!' Trial: The Seattle coffee chain has been offering the new beverages at a few stores to test customer reaction . However, when Jason Jepson tested all three for CNBC he found them lacking in flavor. 'The flavor was OK, but you can really tell that the mix comes from a box,' he said. Starbucks spokesman Linda Mills said in response: 'This is a test, and that's part of it.' She added that many customers had requested to have their regular iced beverages carbonated. The new test range is the latest in a series of moves by Starbucks, which has more than 19,000 branches around the world, to expand beyond coffee. The company has also started to move into premium juices with its Evolution Fresh range and, with tea becoming a growth opportunity, it acquired a chain of shops called Teavana. New look: Starbucks also runs the Teavana chain as tea grows in popularity . The move into the soft drinks market is a shrewd decision by Starbucks, which could find itself part of a $77 billion carbonated beverage category. 'Starbucks is ... smart to test these products,' John Sicher, editor of trade magazine Beverage Digest, told USA Today. 'This may help bring in customers who want something other than coffee.' Each of the three drinks in its test range are described as handcrafted and are made with no preservatives or artificial colors, and contain no high-fructose syrup.","Coffee chain tested handcrafted beverages in selection of stores .

A retired businessman who once enjoyed all the perks that came with his six figure salary job is being forced to make ends meet in his retirement by working two lowly paid part-time jobs. Former high flying marketing executive Tom Palome, 77, now fills his days making $10 an hour to demonstrate food at Sam's Club and $8 an hour flipping burgers and serving drinks at a golf club in Tampa, Florida. ‘I earn in a week what I used to earn in an hour,’ Palome, who used to fly first class on business trips to Europe, told Bloomberg. Former high flying marketing executive Tom Palome now fills his days demonstrating food at Sam's Club and flipping burgers and serving drinks at a golf club in Tampa, Florida . While Palome worked hard his entire career, paid off his mortgage and put his kids through college, like most Americans he didn’t save enough for retirement. In addition, his savings more than halved to $40,000 after the financial crisis struck in 2008. In need of cash to maintain his lifestyle and with years if not decades of life ahead of him, Palome took the first job he could find – not easy to find for someone at his stage in life. Palome’s reduced circumstances are part of a much the larger trend in America in which workers from all wage brackets are being forced to stay on in the workforce as they both live longer and have fewer retirement savings to rely on. Palome says he isn't bitter about his reduced circumstances and is grateful for his health and that he can work . At the Rogers Golf Club in Tampa, Palome is constantly on his feet manning the takeout counter, cash register and grill - all for $8 an hour plus tips . Last year 7.2 million Americans aged 65 and older were employed - a 67 percent increase on a decade ago . Half of the respondents - aged 50 to 64 - don't think they'll ever have enough money to retire (2011 AARP survey) The official unemployment rate for Americans 55 and over is 5.1 percent (Bureau of Labor) That doesn't include the 1.4 million Americans forced into early retirement during the financial crisis . 59 percent of households headed by people 65 and older currently have no retirement account assets (National Institute on Retirement Security) Even many affluent baby boomers who are approaching the end of their careers haven’t come close to saving the 10 to 20 times their annual working income that investment experts say they’ll need to maintain their standard of living in old age. The situation is also getting worse. The baby boomer generation, who began turning 65 in 2011 and are reaching that age at a rate of about 8,000 a day, are the first generation expected to fund their own retirements, even as they live longer lives. Company-paid pensions are mostly a thing of the past now, replaced in the last three decades by 401(k) accounts primarily funded and managed by employees. The median 401(k) balance for households headed by people aged 55 to 64 who had retirement accounts at work was $120,000 in 2011, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. ‘The current retirement savings systems isn’t working, and that’s becoming a crisis as Americans who make it to 65 in good health are now living at least two more decades,’ said Larry Fink, chief executive officer of BlackRock Inc. (BLK), the world’s largest asset manager. In the 1970s, Palome was a vice president of marketing for the pharmaceutical company, The Cooper Companies, he helped secure an endorsement for the Oral-B toothbrush from the U.S. Olympic Committee.

Now he's expected to sell at least two . boxes of crackers during his seven-hour shift at Sam’s Club. At the . Rogers Golf Club in Tampa, he’s constantly on his feet manning the . takeout counter, cash register and grill. Rather than focus about what he used to have, Palome prefers to be optimistic about his situation. He is in good health, lives independently and he in gainful employment. ‘I tell people I demonstrate food and I do short-order cooking. I don't mind saying it. What's important is that I can work today,’ he told Bloomberg. Palome receives $1,200 from Social Security and a $600 a month pension from his last corporate job. Still, his $1,400 in monthly wages allows him to bolster his savings and provides for some extras. He goes to the theater, pays for plane tickets to visit his children and grandsons and takes occasional vacations. Two years ago Palome met Maxine Haynes, left, from the AARP Senior Community Service Employment Program who helped him find work . ‘I know seniors like me who hardly ever leave their homes because they don’t have money to do anything,’ Palome said. ‘They could work, but won’t take a lesser job.’ Two years ago, Palome saw an advertisement in a local paper for the AARP Senior Community Service Employment Program. He met with Maxine Haynes, the program’s Tampa project director, who helped him get an interview at Advantage Sales & Marketing LLC, which runs food demonstrations for Sam’s Club and other stores. To stretch his income, Palome runs his dishwasher once a week and turns off his hot water heater every morning after he showers. He buys airline tickets six months in advance, booking rental cars for as little as $13.80 a day. If Palome has one regret, it’s that he didn’t get better retirement investing advice somewhere along the line. “I thought I could do it on my own,' he said.

As summer ends and the air turns colder, the skies are filled with birds flying south for the winter - and this year they were joined by another winged creature of a more ethereal nature. But the eagle that appeared over Filton in Bristol this morning was not there to prey on the smaller swallows and swifts on their annual migration. Bird-lover Andrew Winter, 54, had taken a break from the office when he spotted the cloud formation that resembled a bird hovering over an industrial estate. Swooping: The wispy cirrus cloud that resembled a bird was photographed over Filton in Bristol this morning . Mr Winter, 34, said: 'It was uncanny. I'd popped outside for a quick cigarette break and looked up and there it was. 'I ran back into the office and told everyone, but they didn't believe me. 'One joker asked me if I was cirrus - which of course I was.' Cirrus clouds form at very high levels in the atmosphere - above 20,000ft. The extremely cold temperatures at these levels mean the clouds are made up of ice crystals, meaning they appear thin, wispy and white. Birds including swallows and swifts usually migrate from the UK in September and October, travelling thousands of miles to Africa, Arabia and the Indian sub-continent. They can travel more than 200 miles in a day at a maximum flight speed of 17-22mph. Icarus wings: The 'bird' appeared to be on a final descent like the figure from Greek legends who died when the wax holding together his home-made wings melted when he flew too close to the sun . Flight of fancy: Andrew Winter rushed back to the office to tell his colleagues - many of whom did not believe him . The bird-shaped cloud was just one of several amazing formations that have been spotted by keen photographers and cloud-spotters. Clouds shaped like continents have been seen in recent months, as have others looking like animals such as dolphins. Thanks to smartphones, more people are able to snap the beautiful images before they disappear. Meanwhile, flocks of birds are also known to form themselves into cloud-like formations. The annual murmuration of starlings in the skies over Scotland involves thousands of the birds taking to wing to perform a mating ritual. In the display that only occurs during winter months, the starlings use their amazing sense of spatial awareness to fly in a way that deflects predators.

The ceremony was the 23rd annual event for awards that celebrate the weirdest and funniest scientific discoveries in fields including psychology, biology and physics. The winners come from all over the world and Nobel laureates handed out the prizes during a ceremony at Harvard University on Thursday, sponsored by science magazine Annals of Improbable Research. Scroll down for video . The IG Nobel Prize for psychology went to an experiment that found people who are drunk also think they are attractive. Researchers from Ohio found that the higher a person's blood alcohol level, the higher their attractiveness rating. They also found this was the case when people drank alcohol-free placebos .

Dung beetles travel in straight lines by taking cues from light released by the sun, during the day, and the moon at night. They do this to make sure they can push any dung piles to safety quickly, using the most direct course, to avoid going over old ground and running into predators or rival beetles. Yet the insects' ability to stay on course overnight when the moon wasn't visible led the researchers to discover the beetles can also use the location and light from stars in the Milky Way as a guide. Masanori Niimi, from Teikyo University in Tokyo, won the medicine prize for his work into mice with heart transplants. He discovered that a mice with a heart transplant will survive longer if they listen to particular music. For example, a control group of mice survived an average of seven days after a transplant, although those that listened to Verdi's opera La Traviata survived for an average of 27 days. Bert Tolkamp and his team from research centres in the UK, the Netherlands and Canada discovered that the longer a cow has been lying down, the more likely that cow will soon stand up.

Intensive farming, pesticides and garden decking sent their numbers plummeting, but Britain's house sparrows seem to have pulled out of the dive. Ornithologists say that the number of house sparrows appears to have stabilised after years of decline. While it is not clear what is behind the reversal in fortunes, wilder gardens may play a part. Ornithologists say that the number of house sparrows (pictured) appears to have stabilised after years of decline. While it is not clear what is behind the reversal in fortunes, wilder gardens may play a part . Pesticides, changes in farming practice, birds of prey and even the fashion for replacing lawns with decking were all blamed for numbers halving from around 12 million pairs in the 1970s to just six or seven million today. But a survey of garden birdlife by almost 15,000 members of the British public suggests that that numbers have stabilised at last. A spokesman for the British Trust for Ornithology, said: ‘The decline has levelled off.’ The encouraging news from the Garden BirdWatch survey is reflected in data from the wider countryside, the BTO said. Pesticides, changes in farming practice, birds of prey and even the fashion for replacing lawns with decking (pictured) were all blamed for numbers halving from around 12 million pairs in the 1970s to just six or seven million today . The charity said the gregarious birds may have benefited from gardeners being increasingly reluctant to use powerful pesticides that kill the caterpillars they use to feed their young. With sparrows enjoying hiding in hedges and ivy, the trend for leaving patches of garden untended to allow nature take its course may also have helped. In contrast, the fad for covering over green space with decking may have been partly responsible for the decline. Clare Simm, of the BTO’s garden ecology team, said: ‘We are a nation of wildlife lovers and more people are now managing their gardens for wildlife, which will be benefiting our house sparrows. ‘There is also a greater awareness of clean feeding stations and in reducing garden pesticide use. The charity said the gregarious birds may have benefited from gardeners being increasingly reluctant to use powerful pesticides. With sparrows enjoying hiding in hedges and ivy, the trend for leaving patches of garden untended to allow nature take its course may also have helped . 'The combination of these factors could be helping the house sparrow to maintain its population.’ To ensure numbers don’t drop again, she advises those with bird feeders to keep them clean and free of mouldy food that can spread disease. Other tips include letting a patch of garden go wild to encourage insects and planting species such as hawthorn and ivy which provide thick vegetation for house sparrows to hide in. Having the biggest playlist doesn't make a male songbird the brainiest of the bunch. Researchers found that the best singers among a group of sparrows were the worst at food-finding puzzles. The study is the first to find that birds with an impressive selection of songs struggle in other areas. 'For songbirds, singing a lot of songs indicates a bird is smart, but that signal is not necessarily indicative of intelligence for everything,' said Duke biologist Steve Nowicki, who led the research. In a series of problem-solving tests with the birds, he and his colleagues found that the male song sparrows that sang the most songs learned to solve food-finding puzzles more slowly than the birds singing fewer songs. The researchers think that female song sparrows may use potential mates' songs to gauge both mental strengths and weaknesses. Nowicki and collaborators first measured the number of songs 14 male song sparrows sang. They then taught the birds to identify where a mealworm was hidden in one of 12 shallow wells on a wooden rectangle. The scientists put plastic caps over six wells so that the birds had to learn and remember spatially where the worm was on the wooden block. The birds that learned to solve the food puzzle more quickly sang fewer songs -- an observation opposite of what the scientists expected.","Ornithologists say that the number of house sparrows appears to have stabilised after years of decline .

The huge divide in Britain’s house price boom was revealed today, with only London leaving the regions far behind. The capital saw rises of almost 10 per cent in July, but prices fell in Scotland, Wales and the north of England. To add to the pain, house prices are rising faster for first-time buyers than for those who already own a home. Ministers played down talk of a new ‘housing bubble’ as experts warned the recovery was far below historic trends. Average house prices rose by almost 10 per cent in London in the year to July, but fell in Wales, Scotland and northern England . Struggle: House prices for first-time buyers are rising faster than those who already own a home . The latest House Price Index showed values in England have now exceeded the peak in January 2008. But it is almost entirely fuelled by a sharp rise in prices in London and the South East. The Office for National Statistics said that UK house prices in July were 3.3 per cent higher than in 2012, up from a 3.1 per cent rise in June. But when London and the South East are removed, prices are only up 0.8 per cent. Last week, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) suggested that a 5 per cent cap should be placed on annual house price growth to stop any future house price bubble and borrowers taking on too much debt for fear of missing out on a boom. ‘House price growth remains stable across most of the UK, although prices in London are increasing faster than the UK average,’ the ONS said. ‘The year-on-year increase reflected growth of 3.7 per cent in England and 1.8 per cent in Northern Ireland, offset by falls of 2 per cent in Scotland and 0.7 per cent in Wales.’ In July prices paid by first-time buyers were 4 per cent higher than a year earlier. By comparison for existing owners prices were only 3 per cent up. Chancellor George Osborne has announced plans for the government to guarantee 95 per cent mortgages under the Help to Buy scheme. But Business Secretary Vince Cable has warned the plans risk fuelling a new housing boom in areas where property prices are already soaring while pricing first-time buyers out of the market. London's house prices are now double those in many areas, and rising faster . The House Price Index in England is now higher than the peak in January 2008, but other parts of the UK are still struggling . Help to Buy was launched by the government in the 2013 Budget to support £113billion worth of mortgages in England. You will only need a deposit of at least 5 per cent on properties worth up to £600,000. The Help to Buy scheme has two parts. The first, which is already live, provides a 20 per cent initially-interest free equity loan from the government, topped up with a 5 per cent deposit from the borrower so you could put down 25 per cent towards a mortgage. This is the bit that is running now and relates to NewBuy. The second part, launching in January 2014, and running for three years, will provide an indemnity on up to 15 per cent of a mortgage, giving banks and building societies more confidence to lend to those with a small deposit. by also indicating . that he has private ‘red lines’ that would prompt him to walk out of the . Cabinet. Row: Chief . Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander defended the Help to Buy scheme from criticism from  Vince Cable that it could fuel a new property bubble . Mr Cable has raised concerns about the second part of the scheme, and has proposed it being limited to regions outside London. But today Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander rebuffed the concerns. ‘I don’t see any sign of a housing bubble - far from it, at the moment,’ he said. ‘The problem we have at the moment is twofold - one is we’re not building enough houses as a country, we want to see more construction activity as part of that economic recovery. ‘And secondly that there are vast numbers now of young families who have a steady job who can afford the monthly repayments on a mortgage but simply don’t have the resources to make a big deposit that banks now require. ‘I think it’s a good role for the Government to step in with a guarantee to help those people be able to get started - fulfil their aspiration to own a home. ‘But of course there will be safeguards in place: the scheme is time-limited for three years, and the Bank of England will have the chance to have a say if any government in future wants to continue it. But I think for the circumstances we have now, it’s the right thing to be doing.’","UK price rises fuelled by new boom in London and the South East .

Scientists now claim that the moon is around 4.4 and 4.45 billion years old, rather than the 4.56 billion years previously thought. Despite being the nearest body to the Earth, astronomers are still not sure precisely how or when it formed. Scroll down for video... One theory suggests the moon formed when a planet, around the size of Mars, collided with Earth around 4.56 billion years ago. This collision divided Earth into two unequal parts. The smaller of these condensed into the Moon . One theory suggests the moon formed when a planet, around the size of Mars, collided with Earth around 4.56 billion years ago. This collision divided Earth into two unequal parts. The smaller of these condensed into the moon. The best simulations of this process suggest that about 80 per cent of moon ought to have come from the impactor and 20 per cent from the Earth. Scientists have long studied the moon’s crustal rocks to try and estimate its age. VIDEO: The evolution of the moon . As methods have improved, the most precisely determined age for the lunar rocks that arose is 4.360 billion years, the researchers said. Meanwhile on Earth, scientists have found signs of a major melting event that occurred around 4.45 billion years ago. From this, researchers have drawn the conclusion that the catastrophic collision that formed the moon occurred around 100 million years or so before. ‘There are several important implications of this late moon formation that have not yet been worked out,’ said Richard Carlson, of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington. ‘For example, if the Earth was already differentiated prior to the giant impact, would the impact have blown off the primordial atmosphere that formed from this earlier epoch of Earth history?’ The results were presented yesterday at a meeting organised by the Royal Society in London called ‘Origin of the moon.’ Researchers have drawn the conclusion that the catastrophic collision that formed the moon occurred around 100 million years or so before . A controversial new theory has been proposed that a giant explosion equivalent to 40 billion atomic bombs originating from the Earth's core somehow led to the formation of the moon. Planetary scientist Wim van Westrenen believes this violent event took place approximately four-and-a-half billion years ago and could answer the hotly contested question of where our moon comes from. The scientist, from VU University in Amsterdam, told New Scientist magazine that previous explanations about how the moon came to be simply do not add up.Chemical analysis of the rocks last year by the University of Chicago found that they shared identical oxygen, silicon and potassium isotopes with Earth, hinting that the Moon shares its origin with the Earth. Van Westeren said that taken at face value, the findings suggest that the moon was once part of the Earth that was blasted into space by an enormous explosion from the Earth's fiery core. To do this, he believes that there must have been a 'massive energy kick' delivered quickly and he calculates that the explosion was the strength of 40 billion atomic bombs the size of those dropped on Hiroshima.","Scientists claim that the moon formed around 4.4 and 4.45 billion years ago -rather than the 4.56 billion years previously thought .

A bitter row has erupted over the planned tomb of Richard III after a historical society announced it is withdrawing £40,000 in funding because members are unhappy with the design of the tomb. Leicester Cathedral announced proposals for the £1.3m raised tomb last week, which the Richard III Society has branded 'too modern and stylised'. The Cathedral, which is set to be the final resting place for the king, responded by saying it will not change the plans for the tomb to secure the donation.

Members of the Richard III Society have now withdrawn their £40,000 funding for the tomb because they are unhappy with the design . Under the current plans, the raised tomb will feature a deep carved cross and lie on a floor inlaid with a large Yorkist white rose if planning officials approve the project. The name of the King, his date of birth and death, along with his personal motto Loyaulte me Lie (Loyalty binds Me) and his boar badge will also be carved into a dark circular band around the tomb. Philippa Langley, of the Richard III Society, said: 'Members feel it is a very difficult design. They think it has been designed with the cathedral in mind, and not for a medieval warrior king. 'What they say, and fear, is that it won't stand the test of time. I pretty much agree with that.

The society thinks the tomb has been designed with the cathedral in mind, and not for a medieval warrior king (pictured) However, the cathedral has hit back, saying it will not be 'held hostage' by the society. Canon Peter Hobson said: 'We have never banked on that money. 'Let's be clear - the money has never come to Leicester Cathedral. We didn't ask for it, it was attached as a 'You give us the tomb we want, and we'll give you £40,000'. 'Of course we would be very grateful for any donation from the members but we can't make our design hostage to their money.' 'Philippa, and those writing to her, bring just a particular perspective. We understand it but we don't think it can be the last word. 'We would rather have their support, but I suppose if you put it that way I would have to say not at any price.' The plans unveiled last Friday revealed a raised limestone tomb with a deeply carved cross, on a floor inlaid with a large Yorkist white rose. The tomb will be crafted from limestone quarried in Swaledale, Yorkshire, near to where Richard III underwent his boyhood training in knighthood and later made his home. The design is now set to be submitted to church planning officials before a final decision is made next month. Set within the cathedral's chancel, the £1.3 million pound proposals also includes changes to the Cathedral's internal layout, windows and lighting.

'This is our best iPhone launch yet―more than nine million new iPhones sold―a new record for first weekend sales,' said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. 'The demand for the new iPhones has been incredible, and while we’ve sold out of our initial supply of iPhone 5s, stores continue to receive new iPhone shipments regularly. 'We appreciate everyone’s patience and are working hard to build enough new iPhones for everyone.' An Apple statement added that remaining iPhone 5S orders will shipped 'in the coming weeks.'

Reports then came in that the official Apple store, as well as a number of third-party retailers, had sold out of the high-end iPhone 5S model. Before the launch, the BBC discovered several networks admitted stock 'was severely limited in the UK', and predicted many customers would be disappointed. The handset will cost £469 for 16GB and £549 for 32GB when bought outright. 4-inch Retina display. Five colours: green, blue, yellow, pink, white. A6 processor - same as the iPhone 5.

Three colours: gold, silver and slate. A7 chip is twice as fast as the iPhone 5. Built-in fingerprint scanner with Touch ID  unlocks the phone and can be used for purchases. Dual-flash LED camera with 28-megapixel panoramic photos. The iPhone 5S has 10 hours of talk time and 250 hours of standby. Although pre-orders for the 5C model began on 13 September, Apple did not allow the 5S to be reserved in advance. An . unidentified network spokesman told the BBC they had been sent 'crates . and crates' of the 5C, but were being 'drip fed' the more expensive 5S. O2 is only selling the phones online, although customers can test demo models in stores. A spokesman said this is the first time O2 has had to put its stock completely online because of the shortage. Vodafone admitted not all of its stores across the country would have the phone on the day of launch. An employee shows the the backside of a new Apple iPhone 5c, right, and iPhone 5s, which launched today and saw thousands of people waiting in line to buy them outside Apple stores across the globe . Sources at U.S. networks added that they have received significantly fewer handsets than expected, too. One told AllThingsD: 'We will have grotesquely unavailable inventory'. Another . complained of 'extremely disappointing shipments from Apple, ' yet . didn't think it would be a problem in the States because the iPhone 5C . will be more popular.' Reviews of Apple's new handsets have been mostly positive, but the prices of both were criticised before the launch for not being low enough to attract new customers. Critics also claimed the addition of the fingerprint scanner was merely a gimmick, yet this was not enough to put customers off from buying them.","More than nine million handsets were sold during the first three days .

Richard III will be buried under a raised tomb made out of Yorkshire limestone, cathedral chiefs have announced. Leicester Cathedral said it wanted the tomb to have links that would reflect the last of England's Yorkist kings and the stone will be quarried close to where the king grew up. The news comes amid a legal challenge by distant relatives of the King, who have questioned the decision to make Leicester the final resting place for his remains. The Dean of Leicester, the Very Reverend David Monteith (centre) and The Bishop of Leicester Tim Stevens (right) pose with plans for the tomb of King Richard III in Leicester Cathedral . Plans for the raised tomb, which will be carved out of finely worked Swaledale fossil limestone and feature a deep carved cross, will now be submitted to planning officials for a final decision. The limestone is quarried in Swaledale, Yorkshire, near to Middleham, where Richard III underwent his boyhood training in knighthood and later made his home. Set within the cathedral's chancel, the £1.3 million project will see the tomb placed on a floor inlaid with a large Yorkist white rose. The name of the King, his date of birth and death, along with his personal motto Loyaulte me Lie (Loyalty binds Me) and his boar badge will also be carved into a dark circular band around the tomb. The project will also see changes to internal layout, windows and lighting in the cathedral. Flowers are laid on the planned site for the tomb of the king in Leicester Cathedral. The news of the design for the tomb comes amid a legal challenge by distant relatives of the king, who have questioned the decision to make Leicester the final resting place for his remains . King Richard III (pictured) was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 bringing to a close the period of English history known as the Wars of the Roses . The plans revealed today will now be reviewed by the Cathedral Fabric Commission for England, with a decision expected later this month. If all goes to plan, the cathedral hopes the king's remains can be re-interred in a ceremony full of pomp next year. But the plans also rely on the outcome of a legal challenge from a group of distant relatives of the king, who call themselves the Plantagenet Alliance. They have applied to the High Court for a judicial review into the decision to grant the city cathedral licence as the final resting place for the King's remains and want to see the remains placed in York, where Richard had strong links. Richard's remains were discovered by archaeologists from the University of Leicester after a dig in a city centre car park following a campaign by the Richard III Society and with the permission of Leicester City Council, which owned the plot of ground. The Dean of Leicester, The Very Rev David . Monteith, said: 'We fully respect the process of the Judicial Review . which will ensure the procedure leading to the re-interment is correct. 'While this takes its course, we must, as . would any Cathedral in this position, seek planning permission for the . detailed and costly changes which need to be made to the building. Richard's remains (pictured) were discovered by archaeologists from the University of Leicester after a dig in a city centre car park following a campaign by the Richard III Society and with the permission of Leicester City Council, which owned the plot of ground . 'The overall concept is regal and respectful in its elegant simplicity, as befits the final resting place of a king of England. 'By placing the tomb in our chancel, we are giving king Richard the same honour as did those friars more than 500 years ago.' Richard III was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 bringing to a close the tumultuous period of English history known as the Wars of the Roses. Richard III not only had a hunchback but he also suffered from roundworm infection, research recently revealed. Scientists found roundworm eggs in a soil sample taken from the pelvis of the skeleton of the king. Since the body of King Richard III was found, scientists have been undertaking careful analysis of the remains, in an attempt to shed further light on the attributes and history of the controversial king. A team of researchers led by Dr Piers Mitchell, of the Department of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Cambridge, used a powerful microscope to examine soil samples taken from the skeleton’s pelvis and skull, as well as from the soil surrounding the grave. The microscope revealed multiple roundworm eggs in the soil sample taken from the pelvis, where the intestines would have been situated in life. However, there was no sign of eggs in soil from the skull and very few eggs in the soil that surrounded the grave, suggesting that the eggs found in the pelvis area resulted from a genuine roundworm infection during his life, rather than from external contamination by the later dumping of human waste in the area. Dr Mitchell said: 'We would expect nobles of this period to have eaten meats such as beef, pork and fish regularly, but there was no evidence for the eggs of the beef, pork or fish tapeworm. This may suggest that his food was cooked thoroughly, which would have prevented the transmission of these parasites.' Dr Jo Appleby, lecturer in human bioarchaeology at the University of Leicester, said: 'Despite Richard’s noble background, it appears that his lifestyle did not completely protect him from intestinal parasite infection, which would have been very common at the time.'","Leicester Cathedral designed the tomb to reflect the last of England's Yorkist kings as the stone will be quarried close to where the king grew up .

French scientists have taken the first steps to reversing the effects of dwarfism and believe the treatment could be used to treat humans. Actor Warwick Davis is pictured . French scientists have taken the first steps to reverse the effects of dwarfism and believe the treatment could be used on humans as early as in three years' time. They think the dramatic effects of dwarfism, which can be caused by over 200 distinct medical conditions and can include painful complications, could be treated with injections of protein. The researchers made their 'breakthrough' by injecting a protein molecule into mice with dwarfism for three months, which allowed them to grow fully. Elvire Gouze, a researcher at the Mediterranean Centre for Molecular Research in Nice, told The Local: 'The treatment is so simple – it’s just the injection of a protein and the results show it really helped.' 'This is a first and although there are more steps we need to take before trials on humans, nothing so far has indicated it couldn’t also work for people with dwarfism.' Scientists injected the mice (which had the condition achondroplasia, which is a genetic mutation that causes the vast majority of human cases of dwarfism) with protein twice a week over a period of three weeks. Dr Gouze said that as three weeks is roughly equivalent to 15 human years for mice, a similar treatment could work on children with achondroplasia without needing daily injections. The researchers think the dramatic effects of dwarfism, which can be caused by over 200 distinct medical conditions and can include painful complications, could be treated with injections of protein . However, the treatment would not suit people past puberty, according to the study, which was published in the journal Science Translational Medicine. The researchers have more tests to conduct on mice to see if the treatment can be delayed, or whether it has to be started straight after birth, before testing it on a larger animal, which could be a primate. She said: 'We could be ready within three to five years to treat humans with this technique.' Dr Gouze also believes the molecule injection relieved conditions associated with dwarfism, which can include lumbar and cervical pain as well as respiratory problems and muscular weakness. Patrick Petit-Jean, vice-president of the French Association for People of Small Stature, told The Local cautiously welcomed the advance in the research, but that the goal should not be to eradicate dwarfism, which effects between 8,000 and 10,000 people in France alone.

A hungry baboon shows it's a cheeky monkey by stealing vegetables from a woman carrying her shopping. The chacma baboon bides its time and waits to pounce on the oblivious shopper who is the victim of a daylight robbery. It patiently waits for people to leave the farmers' market where fresh vegetables are on sale. The moment a hungry and fearless chacma baboon pounces on an oblivious shopper in Cape Town, South Africa, highlights just how bold these primates are becoming living side by side with people in the city . After spotting its target, it ambushes the woman, tugging on her large sticks of rhubarb. The adult male monkey managed to get a firm grip on the plant to snatch it from her box of fresh vegetables. But the greedy baboon wasn't finished and still had an appetite as it grabs a ripe avocado from the woman. Cyril Ruoso from Lailly in Burgundy, . France, travelled to Cape Town, South Africa, to take photographs of the . famous baboons in the area. The . 43-year-old said: 'I travelled to the city to cover the story of the . baboons as their presence is a big issue in that part of Cape Town. Making his move: The baboon had been waiting patiently by the side of the road until he finally spotted an easy target . Score: The baboon tugged hard at the shopper's rhubarb until he pulled it out from the helpless shopper's box of fruit and vegetables . 'In the past, Chacma Baboons were trapped here in large numbers, for use in medial research facilities. 'Thanks to the work of local animal rights activists, this practice has been discontinued. 'As a result, the baboon population has increased and without any natural predators, the animals have become comfortable around humans.' The baboons, who sleep in vacated homes and on roofs of buildings, raid the farmers market and houses for food. Mr Ruoso added: 'They even stake out the local farmers markets, mugging shoppers as they return to their cars. 'Baboons know the market days and what time they start and finish, so they are around at the right moment ready for ambushes. Fussy eater: After successfully robbing the shopper of her rhubarb, and what looks like a bag of mushrooms, the giant primate appears to have a sniff and turn its nose up at its haul . So the shopper bravely returns to retrieve her stolen fruit, presenting another opportunity for the baboon. This time it grabs a ripe avocado - apparently a far more appealing reward for its efforts . 'The monkey keeps a distance, observing until a good opportunity arises to strike at the right time - it is like a guerrilla strategy. 'Baboons are very strong and can be aggressive, and when they want something it's a good idea to let them have it.' While some people find the coexistence of baboons and people entertaining, for others it is turning into a nightmare, . The species has been protected since 1999 and there are now 500 baboons living in 16 groups, increasingly cut off from their native habitats by the sprawling city. Some estates are now plagued with the primates, which scale blocks of flats pillaging anything they can get their hands on from homes with open windows. Those who choose to fight back are limited to sticks, pepper sprays and paintball guns. They have the momentary effect of driving the baboons away, but hunger and sheer nerve always bring them back. Baboons are now a common sighting in the sprawling city, seen trawling through waste bins, loitering at rubbish dumps, stealing from shops and markets and prowling around picnic sites.","The baboon sat and waited patiently for an easy target leaving a farmers' market in Cape Town, South Africa .

A mother yesterday described the moment she kissed her son goodbye but suppressed the urge to go back and give him a second hug – moments before he threw himself in front of a high-speed train. Sarah Pirie, 50, had driven her son Jake to the station after a weekend break at home so he could return to boarding school, an inquest heard. She stood on tiptoes to kiss her 6ft 6in son and went back to the car. ‘I thought about going back to give him another hug,’ she said. ‘But I thought: “No. He’s 17 now. He’s grown up.”’ Suicide: Jake Pirie killed himself on the way back to boarding school in February this year at the age of 17 . Star pupil: Jake was a top student at Uppingham School and was set to continue to university this year . The teenager had been worrying about getting behind with his English A-level coursework and a virus had stopped him playing sport all term. But his mother said she thought he ‘seemed better’ – and after saying goodbye on the platform she returned home to email his housemaster that he was getting back to his normal self. Sadly the sixth-former, a pupil at the £30,000-a-year Uppingham School in Rutland, was already dead by the time she sent the email. The inquest was told that when his mother asked if he wanted to buy a return ticket, Jake replied: . Shocked: Those who knew the teenager said there was no indication that he was feeling suicidal at the time of his death . ‘No, just get a single. I don’t know when I’m next going home or what is going on.’ She added: ‘He told me that he loved me as well. But that was quite normal.’ The tragedy happened 14 years after Jake’s father James Pirie also committed suicide when he was 39. Mrs Pirie told the inquest Jake was a small boy when he witnessed his father try to kill himself in 1998. He succeeded a year later and four-year-old Jake was with his mother when they discovered the body. Asked how this affected her son, Mrs Pirie replied: ‘He had been starting to ask more questions about his father and what he was like.’ She also told the hearing Jake’s grandmother suffered from clinical depression and was being treated in a psychiatric unit. The inquest in Northallerton heard Jake was a ‘talented pupil’ who had offers from three universities. He was worried about English coursework that was due to be handed in and had asked for the deadline to be extended after losing a memory stick he needed to complete it. Mrs Pirie said her son had been allowed home to Thornton Steward, North Yorkshire, on the weekend that he died in February this year because his grandmother had become unwell. She said they had a ‘peaceful weekend’ although he had ‘not eaten as much as he normally did’. Grieving: Jake's friends took to Facebook to pay tribute to him in the aftermath of the tragedy . Jake seemed in good spirits when she drove him to the station late on Sunday afternoon to return to school. He called a friend to discuss sharing a taxi from Peterborough station to school. Describing the incident, train driver John Ashby said he sounded the horn as a warning when he saw the young man close to the platform edge. ‘The person seemed to hesitate and step back – then jumped turning his back to the train,’ he said. He applied the emergency brake but couldn’t avoid hitting the teenager, who died from multiple injuries. Mrs Pirie said her son usually played for the school rugby team but had not felt well enough to join in all term because of an undiagnosed virus, which she thought might have been glandular fever. Unexpected: Northallerton Station, where Jake killed himself after being dropped off by his mother . Jake's . house master Jonathan Lee said the 17-year-old had obtained nine GCSEs . and four AS-levels, and had three university offers. 'He . appeared to be suffering from flu and had got behind with his studies,' he said. 'His mother was concerned about Jake's motivation and . lethargy. She also mentioned he had strained his back. 'I didn't think he was not motivated. But he did appear tired.' Deputy head Karl Wilding said: ‘Although Jake had anxieties about his schoolwork they were not above and beyond any other pupil at that stage of his school career. 'He rarely spoke about his father. There was genuine surprise and shock at Jake's death.' Recording . a verdict of suicide, coroner Michael Oakley said: 'He placed himself . with his back to an oncoming train which he would have known was . literally on top of him when he did this. 'There . is no real suggestion as to why he should have done that. He had been . ill. He had some sort of virus and was concerned about getting behind . with his work and some work due to be handed in.

Women who have had mastectomies to decrease their risk of developing breast cancer have dared to bare by posing naked for a charity calendar. Many of the 25 women involved in the photo shoot are confirmed carriers of a faulty gene - BRCA - putting them at greater risk of hereditary breast cancer. Carly Perkins, 28, from Crawley, is one of the women who agreed to strip off to raise funds for the National Hereditary Breast Cancer Helpline. Confidence boost: Carly Perkins had a preventative mastectomy in March and said posing for the charity calendar helped her post-op self-esteem . Calendar girls: Rachael Staff from Cornwall, left, and Helen Smith from Essex dared to bare to raise money for the National Hereditary Breast Cancer Helpline . The mother-of-one told the MailOnline earlier this year how she had taken the decision to have a mastectomy after finding out she is a carrier of the deadly BRCA1 gene. Her mother had developed breast cancer when she was a teenager (she since recovered after treatment) and her aunt died last year in her fifties after contracting ovarian cancer. Raising awareness: Most of the women involved in the calendar are carriers of the BRCA gene . Shattering the taboo: Helen Greaves from Birmingham, left, and Becky Measures from Chesterfield want to show women with a family history of breast cancer that they are not alone . After seeing what her mother and aunt went through, Carly said she would hate for her own daughter, Tilly, 22 months, to see her battling cancer. She said: 'I saw my mum suffer from cancer growing up, it's really hard to see someone you love like that. 'I don't want my daughter to see me suffering. As soon as I found out I carried the gene, it was a not a case of 'if' but 'when' I would have a mastectomy. Having it now means Tilly will be too young to remember any of it.' With the support of her family, friends and partner, Damian, Carly had the operation in March and chose to have implants fitted at the same time. Women from all over the country, including Dawn Anderson from Rotherham, pictured, took part in the shoot . Brave: Amanda Burroughes from Hove, left, and Michelle Gracey from Stoke On Trent stripped off for charity . She said it took her five weeks to recover and at first she felt self-conscious about her new body. But when she found out the Breast Cancer Helpline were looking for models to pose in their calendar, she decided to volunteer. She was supported by the construction company ISG who sponsored her to take part so that all proceeds of the production of the calendar can go to charity. Carly said it wasn't easy baring all in front of the cameras. She said: 'I was so nervous. It was really nerve-racking but the team at Model Mentor were great at putting us at ease. Taking part has really boosted my confidence and it was great to meet the other women who have been through the same experience as me. Inspirational: Abi from Wales and Fran from London feature in the £10 calendar . 'Having a mastectomy can be a taboo subject and a lot of people still don't understand why women do it if they carry the BRCA gene. I hope this calendar proves having a mastectomy doesn't make you less of a woman or less beautiful.' The 24 hour National Hereditary Breast Cancer Helpline was founded 20 years ago by Wendy Watson, who was one of the first women in the . country to have preventative surgery after discovering nine out of 12 women . in her family had suffered from breast cancer.

Gene faults are extremely rare with only about 1 in 20 cases of breast cancer associated with a faulty inherited gene . If women have concerns about their family history of breast cancer, they should go see their GP.  If their family history suggests they might be at increased risk of developing breast cancer, the GP may refer them on to a specialist family history or genetics service where their options for genetic testing and/or managing their risk can be discussed .","Models are carriers of a faulty gene BRCA .

Mum told me the other kids would catch up but they never did. 'I'd get get called ""fatty"" and other awful names but I'd just console myself with a biscuit.' By the age of 18 Emma who is 5ft 8ins had grown to a size 20. As time passed she got bigger and bigger and reached a massive size 32. Once Emma got invited to a BBQ and after she piled her plate with sausages she sat down - only for her bottom to get stuck in a plastic chair.

I feel like a different person. I guess I am because I've lost the weight of a whole human being! 'I love wearing feminine dresses and heels. I could never wear lovely shoes before because it was just too painful because of the weight of my body. 'I want to lose 15 stone in total and then I will be happy.

'It's great to have both games available to players and to have drawings four nights a week. I think that the two games complement each other,' Otto said. The Iowa-based Multi-State Lottery Association is operated by 33 state lotteries that help oversee Powerball. Mega Millions has no central office and is run by individual state lotteries that handle their own accounting matters. 'I applaud them for looking at changes,' said Iowa Lottery CEO Terry Rich. 'You need to revise, you need to refresh. Any good, big company knows that you need to revitalize your product.' Here are some things to keep in mind ahead of Wednesday night's Powerball jackpot drawing. 1. THE ODDS . Remember, a person's odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 175 million. That's how many combinations are possible with the game's five white balls and one red ball. In this case, there have been 11 drawings since August 10 without a winner. 2. BIG JACKPOTS . A major revamp in January 2012 increased the cost of a Powerball ticket from $1 to $2. It also led to larger jackpots in smaller amounts of time. Of the top 10 Powerball jackpots of all time, nearly half have been recorded after the game change. 3. CONSOLATION PRIZE . Since the revamp, a secondary $1 million prize has made some losers happy anyway. More than 730 people have won $1 million, and more than 120 people have won $2 million through the Power Play option. 4. WHY WAIT FOR THE HYPE? There's technically no need to wait for a larger jackpot. Whether the jackpot is $40 million or $400 million, your odds of winning the top prize are the same. Whether you buy 1 ticket or 10 tickets, your odds are pretty much the same. A higher jackpot just means there's a higher chance there will be more than one winning ticket. 5. SOMEONE IS GOING TO WIN . The chance of a person's combination being selected remains astronomically high, though the chance that some set of six numbers will be selected is 1. That means even though your chances of winning are slim, the chances that someone else will win are high. Ronald Wasserstein, executive director of the American Statistical Association, said that's what makes people think it could be them. When it's probably not. 6. AGAIN, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WIN . Remember, you're probably not going to win. Wasserstein said it's hard for people to grasp how small their chances actually are, since no one can really see 175 million of anything. Wasserstein tries to break it down. Take 175 million one-dollar bills and lay them out. Pick one lucky dollar bill that will win you all $175 million. You can line up those dollar bills twice along the edges of the continental United States. Or you can cover 380 football fields. Imagine picking the one lucky dollar bill from those fields, and that's your chance of winning the Powerball jackpot on a single ticket.","A $400 million winning ticket in the latest Powerball drawing was sold in Lexington, South Carolina .

The South Carolina man was actually just at the store to buy hot dog buns. The lucky guy has chosen to remain anonymous, but lottery officials say the newly minted millionaire was sent out to bye the buns by his wife and when the Lexington gas station didn’t have what he wanted, he bought $20 worth of lottery tickets instead. It was only the man’s second time ever playing the lottery. And the first person he told as he danced around his kitchen: the family dog. Scroll down for video... Frenzy: Reporters swarmed the Murphy Express gas stationi n Lexington, South Carolina Thursday after it was revealed to be the point of sale of the fourth largest winning Powerball ticket in history . The winner cashed in South Carolina’s biggest jackpot ticket ever on Monday and has told lottery officials that he wants to remain anonymous, something a handful of states allow. The lottery released a few details about last week's winner, who lives in Columbia. He stopped to get gas at a Murphy Express gas station outside Columbia in Lexington, South Carolina the day of the drawing last Wednesday. His wife had sent him out to buy some hot dog buns, but the store didn't sell buns. After seeing the $400 million prize advertised, he bought lottery tickets instead. Cha-ching! The Murphy Express is the second of the chain to sell a giant Powerball jackpot ticket. The other one was across town on the other side of Columbia, South Carolina where a reverend bought a ticket worth $260M in 2009 . Just make it out to cash: The unnamed South Carolina winner who will pocket $400M from Wednesday's Powerball jackpot bought the winning ticket only after the store was out of hot dog buns . It was only his second time playing the lottery. The winner checked his ticket Thursday at his home and realized he was a winner. He told the only creature around, his dog. His dog, his wife and lottery officials may be the only people who know the winner for certain. South Carolina is one of only six Powerball states that allow winners to refuse to let their identities to be released. The others are Delaware, Kansas, Maryland, North Dakota and Ohio. Lottery officials aren't saying whether the man took the $399.4 million payout over 30 years or the direct cash option of $233 million. The jackpot was the fourth largest in the history of the game and the South Carolina man was the only winner. Meanwhile, the jackpots have grown . exponentially since the ticket price doubled from $1 to $2 in January . and after California, America’s most populous state, joined the fray in . April. Lucky dog: The man claims it was only his second time ever playing the lottery and that he told his dog before anyone else . An 84-year-old . Florida woman became the winner of the largest Powerball jackpot ever in . May. Gloria C. MacKenzie hit all the numbers for a $590 million . jackpot.

They were . selected by the computer as a ‘quick-pick.’ ODDS . Miracles happen: Balloons and a sign announcing a winner of the Powerball drawing are set up in front of Murphy Express store on Thursday. The winner eventually came forward, though anonymously . A person's odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 175 million. Your odds of picking the winning numbers remain the same regardless of how many people play or how big the jackpot gets. And with so many number combinations, your odds pretty much remain the same whether you buy 1 ticket or 10 tickets. BIG JACKPOTS . In January 2012, Powerball tickets went from $1 to $2, which led to larger jackpots in smaller amounts of time. Of the top 10 Powerball jackpots of all time, nearly half have been recorded since the game change. CONSOLATION PRIZE . Since the revamp, a secondary $1 million prize has made for some happy losers. More than 730 people have won $1 million, and more than 120 people have won $2 million through the Power Play option. SOMEONE IS GOING TO WIN - BUT PROBABLY NOT YOU . A six-number combination will always be chosen, so even though the odds of your combination winning are astronomically low, the chances are high that someone, somewhere, will win. It's math: Don't plan on winning. It's hard for people to grasp how small their chances actually are, since no one can really see 175 million of anything. If you lined up 175 dollar bills, the line would twice stretch along the edges of the continental United States. Or cover 380 football fields. Yet only one of those bills would have the winning numbers. The . winning ticket was bought at a Murphy Express just off Interstate 20 . west of Columbia, the state capital. The store will get a $50,000 bonus . for selling the winning ticket. State officials said the winner will pay South Carolina about $15 million in taxes. ‘I . can't tell you what it feels like to know someone has been that . fortunate and that lucky,’ said Paula Harper Bethea, executive director . of the South Carolina Educational Lottery.

Court documents reveal a huge network of drug dealers that included outlaw bikers, the Canadian Mafia and a Mexican drug cartel responsible for supplying New York City with nearly a billion dollars in marijuana was taken down by the Drug Enforcement Agency and Canadian authorities. The illicit network’s ringleader is French Canadian drug kingpin Jimmy ‘Cosmo’ Cournoyer, authorities say. Cournoyer was caught last spring after stepping off a jet in Mexico. Alleged accomplice: Jimmy Cournoyer's model girlfriend Amelia Racine reportedly let him use her Porsche Cayenne to dodge police surveillance . A five-year probe carried out by the DEA and police from Laval, Quebec, where Cournoyer once lived, shows that his network allegedly specialized in growing and distributing potent hydroponic marijuana harvested in British Columbia, according to the New York Post. The supply of marijuana under his authority was transported in motor homes and trucks across Canada with aid from the Hells Angels, authorities said. The biker gang and the Montreal mob then smuggled the marihuana from Quebec into upstate New York, where trucks delivered it to a warehouse in Brooklyn, authorities and sources said. Cournoyer, 33, reportedly earned enough from his illegal operations to fund a lavish lifestyle, including model girlfriend, Amelia Racine, and extravagant parties that attracted unknowing celebrities, Leonardo DiCaprio among them. Cournoyer is now awaiting trial in Brooklyn federal court for organizing the ‘vast international drug-trafficking enterprise that has been in existence for more than a decade,’ prosecutor Steven Tiscione wrote in recent court papers. ‘The illegal narcotics distributed worldwide by members of the criminal enterprise have a retail value of more than $1 billion, conservatively,’ Tiscione wrote. Unwitting patron: Leonardo diCaprio was one of several unknowing celebrities to attend Cournoyer's parties . The Canadian kingpin had attempted to throw off surveillance teams in Quebec by hiding his expensive Bugatti Veyron in a garage and driving around in a Porsche Cayenne owned by his girlfriend Racine, a Canadian-Brazilian brunette who has worked modelling gigs in Europe, sources told the Post. Cournoyer’s gal pal’s jailed brother, Mario Racine, was allegedly acting as the kingpin’s trusted lieutenant. Mario Racine is now awaiting extradition to stand trial with his boss in Brooklyn, officials say. After his arrest last spring, Cournoyer reportedly refused to board a U.S.-bound commercial airplane to the states while throwing a series of tantrums. Those tantrums forced a total of four plane changes over two days before Cournoyer was finally flown to New York City to await his trial. One of the Canadian kingpin’s biggest clients in New York was reputed Bonanno crime-family member John ‘Big Man’ Venizelos, who is now out on bail in the case, according to sources and court documents. Millions of dollars generated from Cournoyer’s marijuana sales were used to buy cocaine from Joaquin Guzmán Loera, the leader of the notorious Sinaloa drug cartel, according to federal authorities. The alleged sale of the cocaine supplied by Guzmán then further financed Cournoyer’s marijuana operations in Canada.

For the past decade, scientists studying radiation left after the Big Bang have suspected that our universe is lopsided. Now, cosmologists in Edinburgh believe the data actually shows that the universe is curved in a saddle-like shape. If their theory is correct, it could overturn long-held views that anything travelling through spacetime does so in straight lines along a flat universe. Planck's skymap shows that one half of the microwave background is brighter than the other, and the universe has a large cold spot. Scientists believe this provides evidence that the universe is curved . The study, reported by Charles Choi on Inside Science, suggests that in a saddle-shaped universe, objects travelling in parallel with eventually veer away from each other at huge distances. Changes in the light emitted when the Universe was just 400,000 years old - also known as the cosmic microwave background - have helped scientists understand the structure and evolution of the universe. Measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by Nasa’s Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe provided the first clues of a lopsided universe in 2004. Nasa's 2004 results on radiation after the Big Bang were later confirmed by the European Space Agency¿s Planck spacecraft (pictured), which mapped it with greater precision .

The curved shape contradicts the view that moments after the Big Bang, the universe grew massively in size, causing the universe to even out in every direction. Next year, the European Space Agency hopes its Planck satellite will reveal whether the anomaly in CMB data was a fluke by releasing its most detailed analysis yet.

Cold War warrior: Ferguson Smith, a spycatcher who brought down some of the USSR's deadliest spies . A decorated Second World War pilot who went on to hunt Soviet spies selling nuclear secrets during the Cold War has died at the age of 98. Ferguson Smith, a former Bomber Command flight lieutenant, spent 36 years in the Special Branch, tirelessly rooting out agents who stole the nation's nuclear secrets during the paranoid and fearful 1950s and 60s. During his incredible career he was also a bodyguard to the Duke of Windsor, the former king, when he visited the UK following his abdication. His most high profile scalp was George Blake, a double agent who worked for the British Secret Intelligence Service and in 1955 and gave British secrets and details of agents to the KGB, crippling MI6's operation behind the Iron Curtain. He was also instrumental in breaking the Portland Spy Ring, which was selling British nuclear sub secrets to the USSR, as well as capturing traitorous naval attache John Vassall and Klaus Fuchs, the German physicist who exchanged details of Britain and America’s atomic weapons programme to Moscow. Neil Root, an espionage expert, said the British public owe a debt of gratitude to Smith, who would have had to be 'brutal' to achieve his aims. 'There was a real fear of Communist spies in the 50s and 60s. 'At the time espionage and counter espionage were about face to face contact, it was all meeting in dirty macs on park benches. It was much more psychological, you had to be able to read people. 'The things you see in James Bond now, that was the kind of stuff happening then. It was much more brutal, people were killed much more quickly,' he told the Daily Mirror. Mr Root said George Blake was a deadly adversary who employed violence and bloodshed to achieve his nefarious aims. Hundreds of spies were killed in the line of duty thanks to Blake breaking their cover. It was a sting orchestrated by Smith in 1961 that led to Blake's capture. He was jailed for 42 years but escaped and fled to the USSR in 1966. Dangerous prey: George Blake (left), considered the most deadly of Russia's agents in Britain. Klaus Fuchs (right), who was sentenced to ten years in prison in 1950 for passing the secret of the atom bomb to the Russians . Smith was born in 1914 in Aberdeen and was the son a grocer. He joined the police and moved to the Special branch in 1936. He joined the RAF in 1941 and flew Lancasters equipped with radar-jamming equipment - a perilous role as the aerial made the aircraft a favourite target of the Luftwaffe. In an assignment that did not reward failure, he survived 30 missions. He was awarded a medal for rescuing two fellow airmen from fighters over Berlin despite being heavily injured. Ferguson Smith (left), with Detective Superintendent George Gordon Smith after the Portland Spy Ring was dismantled . Red menace: John Vassall, a former Admiralty clerk who was jailed for 18 years for spying. He was a British civil servant who, under pressure of blackmail, spied for the Soviet Union . Upon rejoining the Special Branch in the aftermath of the war, he spied on radicals like fascist leader Oswald Mosley and the explorer Laurens van der Post. Smith also protected VIPs, including the former king, who he once bluntly turned down a cash reward from, stating: 'I don't take tips'. In 1996 he was Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police and running Special Branch. As well as Blake, the Portland Spy Ring and Fuchs, he also caught John Vassall, who worked as an aide to a Civil Lord of the Admiralty. He was gay and Russian agents used this to blackmail him into stealing thousands of classified documents. After retiring in 1972 Smith, a poetry lover, lived quietly with his wife, Margaret, until her death in 2003. The Portland Spy Ring was a group of Soviet spies operating in England from the late 1950s until 1961 when the five main members of the network were arrested by the British security services. The spy ring was caught after MI5 launched an undercover investigation after being tipped off by the CIA that information was being leaked to the Russians from the Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment at Portland, England, where the Royal Navy tested equipment for undersea warfare. Suspicion fell on Harry Houghton, a former sailor who was a civil service clerk at the base, as his extravagant living expenses were far beyond his meagre salary. MI5 was tipped off by the CIA that information was being leaked to . the Russians from the Admiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment, pictured, at . Portland, England . MI5 put Houghton under surveillance and also watched his mistress, Ethel Gee, a filing clerk who handled documents Houghton himself did not have access to. They often went to London, where they would meet a man identified as Gordon Lonsdale, a Canadian businessman. During these meetings Lonsdale and Houghton exchanged packages and MI5 also put Lonsdale under surveillance. They discovered Lonsdale often went to visit antiquarian bookseller Peter Kroger and his wife Helen at their home in Ruislip, northwest London, and the couple were also put under close but discreet watch. In January 1961, Houghton, Gee and Lonsdale were arrested by Special Branch Detective Superintendent George Gordon Smith — as MI5 officers are not authorised to make arrests. Gee's shopping bag contained huge amounts of film and photographs of classified material, including details of HMS Dreadnought, Britain's first nuclear submarine, and the stalling speed specifications of the Borg Warner torque converter. Smith and two colleagues then went to Ruislip to see the Krogers. They found microdots, the photographic reduction of documents in order to make them small enough to be smuggled more easily, hidden inside Mrs Kroger's handbag. The microdots found at the Krogers' home were letters between Lonsdale and his wife, who lived in the USSR with their children.

A severe weather warning has been issued across Britain tomorrow, as temperatures are set to plummet to -88C tomorrow - followed by a leap of 177C to 88C later in the day. Or at least that's the forecast according this morning's BBC Breakfast - which flashed up the somewhat extreme conditions on a satellite map during this morning's show.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Cold front: BBC Breakfast's Carol Kirkwood confidently predicted a rainy spell for northern parts of the UK... but the map behind her warned of more extreme conditions . The next screen then showed a sizzling 88C for Stornoway, Aberdeen, the Channel Islands and the Shetland Islands for later in the day at 4pm. 'The rest of Scotland is under the influence of a weather front...' Ms Kirkwood began - as the technical blunder was noticed. A temperature of 88C would have put Britain at the top of the weather record map - the hottest confirmed temperature on earth being a comparatively cool 56.7C in Death Valley, California . The freak conditions would be fairly isolated, the map suggested, as the rest of the country was forecast to enjoy normal to pleasantly warm temperatures for the time of year, ranging from 11C in the morning to 20C later in the day. Ms Kirkwood's colleagues were quick to point out the technical blunder. Presenter Bill Turnbull said: '88C is well above average, I don’t know what clothes to wear now.' Co-presenter Susanna Reid joked: 'When you said changeable, I didn’t know quite what you meant.' Ms Kirkwood tried to explain the slip-up, saying: 'The new data must be coming into the system.'

"PUBLISHED: . 22:13 EST, 22 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:42 EST, 23 September 2013 . A young boy with stunning good looks has become Britain's first Romeo Beckham lookalike. Evan Taws, 11, has signed to a professional lookalike agency after he was constantly told by family and friends how much he looked like Victoria and David's eldest son. Mother Claire, from Blythe, Northumberland, started looking through pictures and matching up hairstyles of Evan's with those of Romeo - and before long even his teachers started noticing the similarities. Uncanny: Evan Taws, 11, has signed to a professional lookalike agency as a Rome Beckham impersonator . Model: Romeo Beckham featured in the Burberry Spring Summer 2013 campaign . His similarities don't end at just his looks though with him being only 15 days older than the famous footballer' son. Now Mrs Taws, 39, has signed him up to a lookalike agency and he is believed to be the only Romeo lookalike in Britain. She said: 'I spotted the resemblance after a friend of mine pointed it out one day. 'I always thought he looked like Justin Bieber but then I realised he looked much more like Romeo Beckham. 'I started matching up pictures of Romeo and Evan and realised the similarity was uncanny. 'When I searched lookalike agencies there was only a David, Victoria and Harper lookalike but no Romeo so I realised Evan must be the only one.' His mother has signed him up to a lookalike agency and he is believed to be the only Romeo lookalike in Britain . He even managed to bag himself one of the classic Burberry trench coats after his mum scoured the internet for one. Mrs Taws said: 'Romeo is known for the iconic Burberry modelling and I thought the best photos of Evan would be of him posing similarly to that shoot. 'Finding the coat was just complete luck but I knew I had to get it as people would always want the iconic looks recreated. 'As it is a high end brand I'm hoping the coat lasts him a decent amount of time but I'm sure he will grow out of it pretty quickly.' Evan's mother now hopes that he continues to grow up looking similar to Romeo so that he can always keep his famous looks . She had always thought the similarity was just a joke shared between family and friends but when strangers started noticing she realised that there was a chance for Evan to do something about it. This was when she had the idea to put him forward for a lookalike agency. 'Evan thinks it's a good bit of fun and I would make sure it wouldn't get in the way of school or his hobbies. 'He plays football for our local team and thoroughly enjoys it. 'His sister also plays football and the two of them get on really well, even if she does make fun of him for looking so much like Romeo. 'He used to get really embarrassed about it but now he loves it and says he is a hit with the ladies.' Victoria Beckham and Mrs Taws were pregnant at the same time but little did she know that this wouldn't be where the similarities would end. She now hopes that he continues to grow up looking similar to Romeo so that he can always keep his famous looks. Evan said: 'When my mum made a joke about it at first I didn't even know who he was. 'My sister said I looked like Justin Bieber but I didn't like being compared to him too much. 'When I realised who Romeo Beckham was I was really happy as I love football and his dad is such an amazing football legend. 'I was hoping I could fool people into thinking my dad was David Beckham and see what they say.'His mother added: 'I just wish his dad looked a bit more like David.' Evan said: 'When my mum made a joke about it at first I didn't even know who he was'","Evan Taws, 11, is the spitting image of David Beckham's son .

"By . Suzannah Hills . PUBLISHED: . 05:27 EST, 24 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:27 EST, 24 September 2013 . Michael Hirrell, 48, was found dead in his flat after trying to keep warm using a petrol generator when his electricity was cut off . A man was poisoned by fumes from a petrol generator he was forced to put in his flat after his electricity was disconnected during freezing weather, an inquest heard. Michael Hirrell, 48, turned on the machine in his kitchen after npower wrongly cut off his electricity as temperatures plunged to -10C. He was overcome by carbon monoxide from the generator and was found dead in home in Belgrave, Leicester, by his son and a friend. An inquest at the city’s Town Hall was told Mr Hirrell’s body was found on January 25 - eight days after energy supplier npower cut off his supply. Coroner Lydia Brown said Mr Hirrell’s electricity was disconnected when temperatures dropped below zero. She added: 'The wrong decision was made with catastrophic consequences.' The hearing was told the rented flat’s power supply came from a shop below which had been vacated with unpaid bills. Mr . Hirrell was not a registered npower customer and was unaware of the . arrears when company officials turned up to disconnect the supply. The inquest heard he explained he would be left without power. But . despite npower staffs' concerns, caused by the poor weather and him . looking unwell, a decision was eventually taken to cut him off. As a result, Mr Hirrell borrowed the generator from a friend - with fatal consequences. Tests showed fatal levels of carbon monoxide in Mr Hirrell’s body. The hearing was told that under the Energy UK Safety Net Voluntary Agreement, which npower had signed, domestic customers such as the elderly, disabled, and those on benefits should not be cut off. Tragedy: Michael Hirrell, 48, was found dead from carbon monoxide emitted from a generator inside his flat on Cross Street, Belgrave, Leicester, pictured, eight days after npower cut off his electricity . However, as Mr Hirrell was getting . his supply from a commercial premises, he was not recognised as a . customer or deemed to be vulnerable, despite being on housing benefits. Npower’s risk and debt manager Karen Kelsey told the inquest: 'It didn’t happen here because the meter was a commercial meter.' Many of Britain's hard-pressed families will struggle to afford the rising cost of energy this winter as it emerged gas bills have risen by 119 per cent and electricity bills by 47 per cent since 2000. Utility firms have been accused of raking in massive profits as customers struggle to make ends meet. In the past two years alone, gas bills surged by 19 per cent and electricity by 11 per cent. The worst offenders are British Gas and the former regional electricity monopolies, according to a study by the House of Commons Library published earlier this month. More than 20 years after privatisation, they are still charging far more than their rivals, it says. British Gas charges eight per cent more for gas than the average bill from their newer rivals, researchers said. The figures came as it emerged the firm was planning another price rise before winter. High energy prices are particularly devastating for older people, who often live off modest pensions. In recent years, hypothermia cases have been on the rise as the worst-off are forced to choose between heating or eating. Mrs Brown criticised the company for failing to establish whether he was vulnerable before cutting the power. She said: 'It was a rather stark outcome. Nobody made any common sense decision that here was a man about to be cut off. 'All the excuses I have heard about him not being a customer are nonsense.' Kevin Elliott, representing the power supplier, said: 'Plainly, from npower’s perspective this is a deep tragedy and measures have been taken to make sure it doesn’t happen again.' The court heard the company now carries out additional checks before disconnection and, as part of a trial, no customers would be disconnected between October and March. Mrs Brown recorded a narrative verdict and said she would write to npower, energy watchdog Ofgem and suppliers’ trade organisation Energy UK to raise her concerns about the case to try to prevent similar tragedies in the future. After the hearing, Mr Hirrell’s sister Bridie Hirrell said: 'We are angry. Npower should not have cut him off. 'He was clearly vulnerable. I am glad the coroner is going to send them a letter but it will not bring Mick back. We have lost a brother, a son, a father and a grandad.' An npower spokesman said: 'We were saddened to hear about the death of Mr Hirrell and our condolences go out to his family and friends. 'We have co-operated fully and openly with the coroner’s investigation and have since reviewed and strengthened our processes.'

A couple who launched a multi-million pound cannabis empire following the deaths of their two young daughters have been jailed for a total of eight years. Darren and Debra Wright, from Herne Bay in Kent, were devastated when Chloe, four, died in 2004 and then their elder daughter Ella, nine, passed away in 2007. The couple spiralled into depression and, with echoes of Walter White, who produced methamphetamine to pay for medical bills after he was diagnosed with cancer in the TV series Breaking Bad, Wright, 47, turned to cannabis and then began producing it himself. Drugs: Debra Wright, 48, left, and her husband Darren, 48, have been jailed for conspiracy to produce cannabis . The Wrights began producing cannabis after two of their daughters died - and were soon making millions . Family tragedy: The Wrights lost their daughter Chloe, pictured, to a rare form of cancer when she was four . Within a year Wright and his wife headed a multi-million pound empire using Vietnamese illegal immigrants as cheap labour. Over five years they produced cannabis worth £4m at seven factories across Kent, but their luck ran out in April this year when police became suspicious and they fled to a Spanish villa bought with their drug money. Two months later they were extradited back to the UK and yesterday they were jailed at Maidstone Crown Court. Debra Wright, 48, was jailed for three years and her husband was sentenced to five years and eight months behind bars after admitting conspiracy to produce cannabis between April 2008 and April this year. Judge Michael Carroll told Wright he had 'tailored' her sentence so she would be back with their remaining daughter, who is 17, 'before not too long.' The court heard how the couple lost their daughter Chloe to an aggressive form of cancer in July 2004. Police discovered a number of cannabis factories and linked them to the Wrights, who had fled to Spain . After her diagnosis with the rare form of cancer called rhabdomysarcoma, and being told by doctors at Great Ormond Street that there was no more they could do, the Wrights re-mortgaged their Kent home. With help from supporters including actor Shaun Williamson, who played Barry in EastEnders,and former cricketer Phil Tufnell, who is married to one of Chloe's cousins, they raised more than £260,000 to send the child 8,000 miles to doctors in Texas for experimental therapy. But the treatment failed and Chloe died. Three years later, the couple were plunged further into grief when their daughter Ella, nine, died, after a routine operation to remove teeth led to her becoming infected with staphylococcus bacteria. She died as she was being driven home from school after she became ill on her first day back from the operation. Drugs factory: The Wrights have now been jailed, leaving a 17-year-old daughter to cope without them . A year later, Mr Wright's addiction to cannabis had engulfed him, and he enlisted his wife to launch a series of cannabis factories. John Kearney, mitigating for Wright, told Maidstone Crown Court the tragedy of his second daughter's death sent him 'off the rails'. He said: 'Mr Wright became angry and bitter and went off the rails.  A long investigation began into the death. She died from toxic shock due to infection. 'He started smoking cannabis to a great extent... He feels very culpable for what he has done to her. 'The only shining light is their daughter's education. She has been given a place at university in Belfast.' 'Mr Wright became angry and bitter and went off the rails [after his second daughter died].  He started smoking cannabis to a great extent.' - John Kearney, mitigating for Darren Wright . Ben Lloyd, for Mrs Wright, a housewife, said she played a lesser role in the operation and 'buried her head in the sand'. He said: 'She should have asked more questions. After the loss of their two children she was fit for nothing else than grieving. 'It is powerful mitigation.' He added: 'She has to be separated from her only surviving daughter who will have to struggle on without her parents for support.' Judge Carroll, sentencing, told Debra Wright that she had experienced a 'tragedy' but her criminal activity was 'widespread'. He told her: 'You were a willing lieutenant to your husband's activities.  Clearly, you acted enthusiastically when called upon to do so, living off the proceeds of crime... 'I take into account the tragedies you have suffered. I do accept it might well have clouded your judgement.' He added: 'You have a future. You have a daughter. This is also something I can take into account - I will tailor the sentence accordingly so that before long you will able to rejoin her.' The Wrights' story had echoes of the TV series Breaking Bad, in which Walter White, pictured, turns to drugs to make money after he is diagnosed with lung cancer . Sentencing Darren Wright to five . years and eight months behind bars, Judge Carroll said: 'After the . tragedy of your daughters' death you went off the rails and became a . cannabis user but I cannot accept it is the main reason for your . involvement. 'It may have affected your judgement and made you more vulnerable but you were an extremely active and involved conspirator.' Detective Constable Donna Hopper said: 'It was a sophisticated set up managed by Vietnamese illegal immigrants who had to live in cramped and dangerous conditions. 'Evidence of the Wrights' involvement came as a result of extensive enquiries following the discovery of a number of individual factories.' Police linked the factories to a man who was imprisoned for 10 years in 2011, and 11 others have been convicted in relation to the makeshift factories.","Darren and Debra Wright, from Herne Bay in Kent, suffered double tragedy .

The Prince of Wales has revealed that his sons the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry have inherited an essential quality from their father - a love of dancing. Charles joked about his prowess on the dance floor and how William and Harry have picked up the skill during a wide-ranging interview with the magazine Australian Women's Weekly. The heir to the throne also spoke of his joy at the warm reception the Duchess of Cornwall received from Australians last year. The Prince of Wales, pictured here in a disco dancing session in Derby in 1992, claims that sons William and Harry inherited their dancing skills from him . Charles hit the Dance-O-Mat with Lisa Shannon during a visit to Christchurch, New Zealand last year, but says at his age he dances less . Prince Harry showed off his moves when he was invited to dance by Chantol Dormer, when he visited Rise Life, a youth charity project in Kingston, Jamaica last year . Charles and Camilla made their first official visit to the country as a couple last November, and the royal described his delight after wellwishers realised she was 'an incredibly good sort'. The royal was first interviewed by the magazine in 1974 when, aged 26, he declared, 'If I hear rhythmic music, I just want to get up and dance.' The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited Tuvalu and danced with the ladies at the Vaiku Falekaupule . Asked by the publication's deputy editor Juliet Rieden if he still felt the beat, Charles, who became a grandfather for the first time in July, repled: 'Perhaps, it's slightly less becoming once you get to my age.' He added: 'I think given half a chance though, the old one-two and the two-step can come in handy. I'm glad to say that both my sons have inherited it, I think. 'They're very good. They do make me laugh when they get going.' The Duke clearly amused his wife as he demonstrated his 'swagger' dance moves with Vanessa Boateng during a reception at Centrepoint's Camberwell Foyer in London in 2011 . It is easy to see why Prince Harry makes his father laugh when he 'gets going' on the dance floor when you see him dancing with local women during a walkabout at a 'block party' in Belmopan, Belize, central America during the Diamond Jubilee world tour . Harry was spotted dancing numerous times during his Diamond Jubilee tour of the Caribbean last year - especially in Kingston when he visited a charity. And when Charles and Camilla travelled to New Zealand at the end of their Diamond Jubilee tour, they both strutted their stuff with different partners on a pop-up dancefloor in Christchurch. Asked if he was passing his wisdom on to William and Harry, Charles suggested his sons had learnt from him - but wanted to keep it a secret. Charles, seen here trying his hand at Latin dancing at a state banquet in 1999 in Buenos Aires, says even nowadays 'the old one-two and the two-step can come in handy' He said: 'Well, I don't know. I hope so. How do you know? You can try, but no, I've always believed I just do what I do and I hope that they might notice something. 'I mean, funnily enough, I don't see what they're up to when I'm not there, but sometimes I hear back from others that they're surprisingly similar in some ways (to me). So maybe some things rub off ... which they wouldn't want me to know.' Speaking about last year's Australian visit, which marked the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, the prince told the women's magazine: 'Before you go, you wonder what is the reaction going to be - it's always the same. But it was wonderful that they took to her and saw her for what she is - an incredibly good sort. The Prince and Princess of Wales dance together in 1985 at the Lady Mayoress's Committee Dance in Melbourne. Diana made a lasting impression on Australians during numerous visits . 'She loved it and has such incredibly happy memories of her experience and, obviously, I was thrilled, as you can imagine, for Australians to discover just how special she is ... because she's got the most wonderful sense of humour and has some very good jokes.' Charles' first wife Diana, Princess of Wales made a lasting impression on Australians during numerous visits and the Duchess appears to have also won the affections of many people in the country. The first stop for the royals during their tour was the remote outback settlement of Longreach and Camilla endeared herself to the locals by cuddling a 12-month-old kangaroo. The prince still has fond memories of his first visit to Australia, made in 1966 when he was aged 17. When the royal couple visited the outback settlement of Longreach and Camilla endeared herself to the locals by cuddling a 12-month-old kangaroo, called Ruby Blue . The royal spent two terms in the Australian outback at Timbertop, an off-shoot of Geelong Grammar School in Melbourne, on a private exchange from Gordonstoun. During the visit the prince said he plucked up the courage to really talk to the public and learnt to communicate with wellwishers. Speaking about the crowds that had come out to see him Charles said: 'Then, of course, finally, I took the plunge and went over and talked to people, and that suddenly unlocked a completely different feeling and I was then able to communicate and talk to people so much more.' While at Timbertop, 100 miles from Melbourne, the prince joined the other pupils who had to fend for themselves and complete expeditions into the surrounding hills. He said: 'There were leeches and snakes, and those enormous bull ants and funnel web spiders I've never forgotten. And then waking up in your tent and you're frozen stiff in the frost. 'I never imagined that would happen in that part of the world - or all these strange creepy crawlies wanting to do you mischief. But it was jolly good for the character and, in many ways, I loved it and I learnt a lot from it. And I certainly discovered what good value the Australians are.' Speaking about the issues that motivate him the royal said that we had created a 'throwaway society'. He stressed that nations had to look after the natural world: 'What I'm trying to say is there is another way of looking at this if we're going to hand over to our children and grandchildren a planet that isn't totally degraded and compromised. You can't push nature beyond a certain limit. We have to look after it.' Charles and Camilla made their first official visit to Australia as a couple last November, and the royal described his delight after wellwishers realised she was 'an incredibly good sort' Speaking about his views on balancing conventional medicine with complimentary treatments he said: 'I know lots of people who find they aren't benefited in every case by just the conventional, orthodox drug and finally discover that actually an approach - whether it's herbal medicine or acupuncture or various other forms of complementary medicine - actually does benefit them. 'There's a lot that can be done on the preventative side. There's an enormous amount we can do by looking at the whole person.' Charles also stressed that he wanted to see if some of his UK charities could link up with Australian counterparts to tackle issues. One project already off the ground will see the Prince's Foundation for Building Community develop the 'Prince's Australian Terrace' in Melbourne. The development will be an update to the popular Australian terraced house, combining 21st century Australian lifestyle demands with the technology of today which aims to create a sustainable and eco-friendly living solution.","Charles spoke to Australian Women's Weekly following his visit .

A soldier who was stabbed when he tried to stop two thieves was saved by his Help For Heroes hoody which was slung over his shoulders. Lance Corporal Gareth Barton survived after the knife became stuck in the garment’s thick material. Lance Cpl Barton, 35, spotted a man attempting to break into a Royal Mail van in the early hours of the morning while he was out getting fresh air. Protection: Lance Corporal Gareth Barton was saved by his Help For Heroes hoody when he was stabbed after he tried to stop an alleged thief . Injury: The soldier has said his hoody reduced the impact of the knife when he was stabbed in the side . Service: Lance Cpl Barton has served two seven month spells in Afghanistan and is currently on medical leave . But as he grabbed the offender, another appeared and assaulted him, punching him and stabbing him in his side. However, the soldier's hoody reduced the impact of the knife as it stopped the blade from penetrating too deep. Lance Cpl Barton, is a combat medical technician based at the Field Hospital near Normandy Barracks in Aldershot, Hampshire. Having served two seven month spells in Afghanistan, he is now on medical leave and is taking medication for a back injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. His medication gives him trouble sleeping as a side effect causes him to heat up - so he decided to talk a walk for some fresh air and a cool down. The father-of-one said: 'I was out getting some fresh air near a little duck pond - which is by the car park where I found the thieves. Treatment: Lance Cpl Barton, who has served in Afghanistan and Kenya, had the minor puncture wound near his rib-cage patched up at hospital, where he was kept overnight . 'I was starting to sweat a little bit because of the medication I’m on so I took my hoody off and slung it over my shoulders with the arms tied at the front. 'When I confronted the attacker I had my headphones in my right ear listening to music so I didn’t notice the other attacker who was carrying a blade. 'Fortunately, the hoody is quite thick and heavy duty so it definitely prevented the blade going in further than it did. 'I’m always wearing it - it’s my favourite hoody. 'I didn’t even realise I had been stabbed until I ran back to the army base with my hand on my side. Duty: Lance Cpl Barton said he 'couldn't believe' someone tried to stab him in a British street after he had survived two tours of Afghanistan . 'The stab wound was just short of an inch in depth but if it had gone any further it could have required surgery. 'I feel like I did the right thing though and if you asked me if I would do it again I would say yes.' The soldier, who has also served in Kenya, had the minor puncture wound near his rib-cage patched up at hospital, where he was kept overnight. He said: 'I can’t believe I survived two tours of Afghanistan and then someone tried to stab me in a British street. 'If it wasn’t for the hoody the injury would have been much worse - I might not be alive today.' Hampshire police are appealing for information to help catch the suspects. The first is described as a white man in his late teens to early 20s, of slim build, around 5ft 10in tall and wearing dark clothing and baseball cap. The second is a white man of the same height, of average build and wearing dark clothing. A police spokesman said: 'The victim was incredibly brave and this could have been much worse.'","Lance Corporal Gareth Barton was stabbed after grabbing an alleged thief .

Protests have erupted in France after a decision to charge a jeweller with voluntary homicide because he shot and killed an escaping robber. Stephan Turk, 67, has been held under house arrest after shooting Anthony Asli, 19, last week in the French Riviera city of Nice. An accomplice escaped on a motorbike as Asli's body lay in the street outside the shop. Stephan Turk (back seat left), has been charged with voluntary murder after killing a thief who broke into his jewellery store . In a country where gun violence is rare but armed robbery is increasingly common, the shooting - and the formal charges of voluntary homicide - have placed the government in a difficult position. 'Even when faced with the unbearable, we have to let justice prevail,' Interior Minister Manuel Valls said today in Nice, where he was sent by the president a day after a protest by hundreds of Turk's supporters. Jewellers in southern France say they're being targeted like never before and lack the resources to protect themselves. Yan Turk, the son of the jeweller, told the Nice Matin newspaper: 'It was a difficult situation. I don't know how I would have reacted myself. 'I don't endorse what he did, but he had been beaten and threatened with death.' Yahya Turk, the son of Stephan Turk (left) and Franck de Vita, lawyer of Stephan Turk (right) 'We've had it with being targeted by robbers.' Asli had been in trouble as a juvenile and was freed about a month ago from his most recent stint in detention, shedding his own electronic bracelet and moving in with a longtime girlfriend who is pregnant with their child. Asli's family described him as impressionable and immature. Olivier Castellacci, Asli's family lawyer, said: 'The family's not condoning the robbery. They're not condoning it and they're not excusing it. It was Anthony's fault. But did he deserve to die in these conditions?' 'We don't have, in France, the notion of taking justice into your own hands. The family is revolted by that.' France has seen a spate of high-profile jewellery thefts recently and Castellacci said the mobilisation in support of the jeweller is a reflection of unease with increasing violence. Protestors in Nice hold a banner campaigning against the charge brought against Stephan Turk . The robbery was carried out with a shotgun, he said. It wasn't clear whether Asli and the accomplice both had firearms. A single gunman in the southern city of Cannes made off with millions cache this summer. That was followed by another armed robbery days later in the same city. In Paris' wealthy Place Vendome on September 9, thieves drove a sport utility vehicle into a jewellery store, snatching two million euros worth of loot, then set the vehicle on fire and escaped. 'The number of jewelry store robberies has been climbing for years. There's one robbery a day in France,' Christine Boquet, president of the union of jewellers and watchmakers, told the Nice Matin. 'This creates enormous stress for the merchants. They live with this fear and insecurity every day.' Yet the sister of the 19-year-old who was killed says Turk shot him in the back and deserves prison. Mayor of Nice Christian Estrosi, third from the right, and Yann Turk the son of Nice jeweller Stephan Turk, take part in a demonstration . 'He shot a kid in the back. He's a traitor, he's a coward,' said Alexandra Asli, his older sister. Asli, who was shot dead in the street outside the jewelry store, had been convicted 14 times in juvenile court, according to Eric Bedos, the Nice prosecutor. Bedos defended his decision to bring preliminary charges Friday against Turk, whose gun he said was not legal. The voluntary homicide charge is similar to a second-degree murder charge or voluntary manslaughter. 'After he was threatened, the jeweler grabbed his firearm, moved toward the metal shutters, crouched and fired three times. Mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, left, and Yann Turk, son of Nice jeweller Stephan Turk . 'He said he fired twice to immobilise the scooter and a third time he fired because he said he felt threatened,' Bedos told the media. 'I'm convinced that he fired to kill his aggressor. When he fired, his life was no longer in danger,' the prosecutor said. Valls acknowledged the frustration of jewellers, saying armed robberies of their businesses had been climbing steadily for years. 'We understand the exasperation and anger of the merchants,' he said. 'Those who rob must know that there is no impunity and they will be pursued relentlessly.' Castellacci said the Asli family would be satisfied if the jeweller was jailed ahead of trial, justice was done, and people stopped gloating over the 19-year-old's death. 'They don't understand how people can react this way. They haven't yet buried Anthony, and there's this protest. And the jeweller is still free.'","Stephan Turk, 67, charged after shooting Anthony Asli, 19, in Nice .

The LTA’s Roehampton headquarters sits next door to the sports ground of the Bank of England and now they have something else in common — they are both to be run by Canadians. For Mark Carney at one sometimes strife-ridden British institution read Michael Downey at another, albeit slightly less important one. Downey, the 56-year-old chief executive of Tennis Canada, was yesterday brought in to run the Lawn Tennis Association, his mission to try to build the sport up to a level befitting the country which hosts its most prestigious tournament. New man: Michael Downey has been named the new chief executive of the Lawn Tennis Association . Men                            Women . Canada . Milos Raonic (11)         Eugenie Bouchard (46)Vasek Pospisil (40) Great Britain . Andy Murray (3)           Laura Robson (38) Heather Watson (76) Taking over from the polarising and . well-rewarded figure of Roger Draper, no time was wasted in declaring a . break from certain aspects associated with the seven-year reign that is . about to end. Firstly, LTA . chairman David Gregson volunteered that Downey would be paid a salary of . £300,000, less than half the package that Draper took home last year, . which included a bonus of £200,000 and £40,000 in pension payments. Secondly, . Downey, who will take charge in January, emphasised that his vision for . the LTA was a broad church. No more would the governing body regard . outside constituencies of the sport — be they maverick coaches, parents . or private academies — as a potential threat but as partners to help the . game grow. Over and out: Roger Draper has been replaced as chief executive of the LTA by Canadian Downey . 1995-1999 - VP, Sales and Marketing at Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment . Jan 2000 –  Aug 2003-  President of Canada's largest brewery, Molson Canada . May 2004 - President and CEO of Tennis Canada . In 2008, the Rogers Cup tournaments set a record for combined sales and rank among the top global events in terms of attendance and profitability. 'We can’t do it . all ourselves,’ was among the many encouraging statements the new man . made when unveiled at the end of a prolonged search that saw 350 . applications and nearly 30 interviews. He . will, of course, be judged by actions rather than words, but he has . been turned to after a successful nine years in Canada which has seen a . combination of increased grass-roots participation and improved elite . performance. Although not a . high-profile figure in the world game, he has built up a good . reputation, albeit in a country where the pressure to deliver is not the . same. It could hardly be otherwise with Wimbledon just down the road . and more than £30million being pumped into the game from that event’s . profits alone. Mixed: Heather Watson (left) and Laura Robson are on the up but Andy Murray is the only leading British man . While some . will regret the fact the successful candidate is not British, Downey’s . lack of baggage and outsider status may make it easier to make the tough . decisions needed to change the culture of the organisation. The . downside is that it will take time for him to understand some of the . sport’s nuances here. Downey pledged to change the image of the LTA. 'I . wouldn’t have joined this organisation if I thought it was useless,’ he . said. He pledged to learn . fast and travel outside the M25, similar to what he has done in Canada, . where strong relationships in the outlying provinces of that vast . country have been developed.

Murray — recuperating from what is initially said to have been a . successful back operation — has put a spring in the step of British . tennis since his triumph at Wimbledon. 'That . inspires people. Andy’s greatest contribution to tennis in Great . Britain is winning,' said Downey.

In just a few days’ time the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will be moving into their new home at Kensington Palace following a £1.5 million overhaul. Filled with priceless antiques from the Royal Collection, the elegant 20-room apartment will be the centrepiece of the couple’s new court and a family home for their baby son, Prince George. Decorated in shades of cream and eau du nil, it is said to be the epitome of ‘Style Anglaise’ –encapsulating the classic look of an English country house with a modern twist. And it couldn’t be more of a contrast to the relatively modest four-bedroom farmhouse William and Kate quit on Anglesey earlier this month when the prince left his job as a Search and Rescue pilot. One of Kate's favourite shopping destinations during her three years living on Anglesey was the decidedly unglamorous Homebase DIY store . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will move into Kensington Palace with baby George in a few days . In fact, the Mail can reveal, one of Kate’s favourite shopping destinations during her three years living on the island was the decidedly unglamorous Homebase DIY store on the Penrhos Industrial Estate in Holyhead. According to staff, the royal would spend up to an hour browsing, particularly in the lighting and bathroom department, and couldn’t resist purchasing a few nick-nacks for her home. Among her purchases was a three-tier chocolate brown ‘faux leather’ letter tray costing £22.99. ‘You’ll never lose a document again’ the store boasts of this ‘polyurethane and MDF’ bargain. Perhaps William and Kate kept treasured pictures on this cork memo board, which she bought for £12.99 . The Duchess snapped up this faux leather magazine file in brown for just £10.99 . This three-tier letter tray, made of faux leather, £22.99, will undoubtedly have been useful for storing Royal correspondence . Kate apparently purchased this 'Love' cushion for £9.99, which the Homebase website says 'features applique stitched detail, and instantly updates any room' The Duchess also bought a matching ‘faux leatherette’ magazine file for just £10.99.She also snapped up a  £12.99 cork memo board that is clearly popular amongst Homebase clientele, scoring an impressive four out of five star rating on the firm’s website. It also seems as if the couple ensured they dined royally, using pillar box-red House of Style Colourama Round plate coasters, a snip at £1.49 (a reduction of 50p). The website says helpfully that they will ‘protect your tables as well as adding a splash of colour to the room) The piece de resistance, however, has to be the shop’s red felt cushion with the word ‘Love’ emblazoned on it – which first hit the shelves costing £9.99 but can now be snapped up for just £3.99. Called the Home of Style Love Cushion, it is said to ‘instantly update any room’ – although it is not clear whether that includes one in an historic royal palace. The 20-room Kensington Palace apartment has undergone a £1.5 million overhaul and is said to be decorated in neutral shades and to be filled with priceless antiques from the Royal Collection . Whether any of her Homebase bargains will find their way into the Cambridges’ new home at Kensington Palace remains to be seen (although if they did, the Queen, who has a keen eye for a bargain herself and is a regular user of cheap Tupperware, would be sure to approve). The couple are due to move into Apartment 1A, which once belonged to Princess Margaret, in the next few days. The apartment is actually a spacious four-storey, 20-room property with its own large south-facing walled garden, which takes up half the Clock Tower wing originally designed by Sir Christopher Wren for King William and Queen Mary. It boasts generous living space, including five reception rooms, three main bedrooms, dressing rooms and bathrooms, a night and day nursery, staff bedrooms and ‘ancillary’ rooms. The previous resident of the young couple's apartment was Princess Margaret, and her husband, Lord Snowdon . Former residents include Princess Louise, Queen Victoria’s daughter, and the late monarch’s grandson, the Marquess of Carisbrooke, followed by, most recently, the Queen’s sister, Princess Margaret, and her husband, Lord Snowdon. The couple, who moved in following a £1.5 million programme of refurbishment in 1963, famously installed a ‘futuristic’ new kitchen (which has since been ripped out) complete with sleek Formica and teak units. It has been barely touched since the death of the Queen’s sister in 2002, however, and in recent years has been managed by the charity Historic Royal Palaces (HRP), which used the apartment as office and exhibition space. As HRP has already spent a substantial amount of its own money on remedial work, the Queen was last year forced to compensate it for handing the building over to William and Kate. This was met by taxpayers and while it has been described by palace sources as ‘fair’, it is believed to be more than £100,000. It has since emerged that a further £1 million-worth of public money has been lavished so far this year on the transforming apartment into a home fit for a future king and queen. While William and Kate are footing the bill for decoration and other ‘soft furnishings’ personally (and it is understood that this will include a state-of-the-art new kitchen) all structural work, rewiring, re-plastering and the installation of new environmentally-friendly heating and hot water systems, is being met by the government. So far the bill is £600,000 and rising, much of which is down to the discovery of potentially lethal asbestos. A further £400,000 of taxpayer funds has also been spent on a new roof. The Duchess, we can also reveal, is being given her pick of priceless antiques from the Royal Collection, one of the largest art collections in the world which is held in trust by the Queen for the nation, with which to furnish her new home. The Collection is comprised of more than a million objects d’art collated by successive kings and queens over the past 500 years. Although it is a charitable institution whose objective is to preserve and display these items in trust for the nation, one of the perks of being a member of the royal family is that they are also permitted to ‘borrow’ items to furnish their private homes. Kate is said to be having great fun in using her history of art degree to pick out some really special pieces – paintings in particular - but also display cases, dining tables and chairs. The Duchess is being given her pick of priceless antiques from the Royal Collection to furnish her new apartment . A palace source argued: ‘It is the same for the Queen and other Members of the Royal Family with regards to both their private residences and their offices. The alternative is [that] everything sits in storage. ‘ . Contrary to reports that she has employed an interior designer, Kate has eschewed offers of professional help and is, it can be revealed, overseeing the work herself with the help of her private office. The Duchess, who has a history of art degree, is said to have ‘a real interest in design’ and has been encouraged by her father-in-law, Prince Charles, to ‘stamp her personality’ on the project, albeit using British-sourced, environmentally-friendly products as much as possible, naturally. She has been seen perusing fabrics in the upmarket Chelsea Design Centre in London but has also been seen shopping in department stores such as Peter Jones and John Lewis. ‘It’s a big task but she’s confident enough to know exactly what she wants and how she wants to do it,’ said a source. Although aides working for the Duke and Duchess admit the works being carried out at Kensington Palace are ‘extensive’, they insist that costs will be kept to a ‘bare minimum’ and maintain much of the outlay will fall to the couple privately. ‘Currently, the apartment is totally uninhabitable without major structural works being carried out and the only public money being used is for remedial work to turn the apartment back into living accommodation,’  said one. ‘The cost of any interior decorating and soft furnishings beyond basic re-plastering and painting and the like will be met by the Royal Family privately. ‘The couple are insistent that any costs to the public must be kept to the bare minimum.’ The spokesman added:  ‘It is important to note that the last major works in the apartment took place around the time that Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon moved into the apartment, following their marriage in 1960. ‘ .","Kate loved shopping at Homebase while William was on RAF patrol .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . PUBLISHED: . 19:54 EST, 23 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:57 EST, 24 September 2013 . An abortion doctor who is serving consecutive life sentences for performing countless grisly and unorthodox late-term abortions at his Philadelphia clinic is speaking out in defense of his heinous crimes. Kermit Gosnell, 72, whose crimes include snipping the spinal cords of live, partially birthed infants, says he was on a mission to help eradicate poverty. A new interview with Gosnell, who was handed a third life sentence this past May, portrays the killer physician as unrepentant and even proud of his work as 'a soldier at war with poverty.' Unrepentant: Gosnell is pictured leaving the Criminal Justice Center after he was found guilty in May. The abortionist ran a gore-filled clinic of horrors for decades but says it was part of his crusade against poverty . Philadelphia reporter Steve Volk sat with Gosnell in prison. His exclusive interview with the man who he says comes off as charismatic and intelligent appears Tuesday in Philadelphia magazine article. ‘He believes himself to be innocent,’ Volk told ABC News. ‘In this larger spiritual sense. He believes he was performing a service for people that asked him. He believes he was a soldier at war with poverty. He has a sense of righteousness, that whatever rule he broke, it was worth it.’ Volk believes Gosnell sees abortion as sinful but that alleviating patients' poverty--compounded by the financial burdens of parenthood--outweighed that sin. 'It's not as if he feels guilty about what he did. He sees the world is a dark place. He sees himself as having performed a noble function in society. For him, in a perfect, idealized world, it wouldn't be necessary,' Volk told ABC. 'House of Horrors': Testimony from workers and other witnesses portrayed Gosnell's clinic in an impoverished Philadelphia neighborhood as a horrifying, filthy place filled with the body parts of aborted babies . War against poverty: Gosnell is serving consecutive life sentences. He maintains in an interview from jail that hits news stands Tuesday that he was working for good and that abortion, though sinful, was less so than living in poverty . Gosnell has been imprisoned since 2011. ABC News reports that since then he’s been studying the Bible, learning Spanish, and exercising. He’s even been reaching out to charities like the Bill And Melinda Gates Foundation to speak out about prison issues. ‘He believes that he gained insight into what it's like to be pushed into the system, without the capacity to explain himself,’ Volk told ABC. ‘He believes if he could have spoken about his rationale for doing things, he wouldn't be in jail.’ Volk's article Gosnell's Babies hits newstands September 24. Gosnell's trial revealed atrocities that shook pro-choice and anti-abortion Americans alike. Authorities alleged he used scissors to sever partially-birthed infant’s spinal cords. Plastic bags full of body parts were found in a refrigerator at the Philadelphia practice. He and his staff brought about the deaths of an untold number of birthed and partially birthed children in medically unsafe and grisly ways in his 30 years as a practicing physician. In court testimony, the jury heard how a clinic employee had photographed a baby after Dr Gosnell had joked: 'He's big enough to walk you to the bus stop.' Clinic workers also testified that they had another a little baby girl move her arm before her neck was snipped, killing her. And yet another infant was born in the . clinic's bathroom and was seen struggling to get out of the toilet . before a worker snipped that child’s spine as well. Gosnell's . grotesque business was discovered more than two years ago when . authorities went to investigate prescription drug trafficking at . Gosnell's clinic in a low-income area of West Philadelphia. Unfathomable: A grand jury photograph shows what police say are plastic bags hiding body parts in a refrigerator inside the Philadelphia practice . Sickening: The jury saw another photo of bags of body parts. One witness said a sink was plunged and a baby's arm came out. Another report said a toilet had to be removed when a baby became lodged in a pipe . They came across blood-splattered operating tables, bags of body parts, unsanitary instruments, jars of severed feet and the stink of cat urine, according to a 2011 grand jury report. The tiny fetuses and many of their bodyparts were piled high throughout Gosnell’s clinic in cabinets and freezers, in plastic bags, bottles, even cat-food containers. The report added that dozens of women were injured at Gosnell's clinic over the past 30 years, calling it a 'house of horrors'. Some left with torn wombs or bowels, some . with venereal disease contracted through the reuse of non-sterilized . equipment, and some left with fetal remains still inside them, the . report alleged. Employees at the clinic confirmed that babies were often expelled from their mothers into the toilet. On at least one occasion the toilet had to be removed from the floor to 'get the fetuses out of the pipes.' Former staffers testified that patients received heavy sedatives and painkillers from untrained workers while Gosnell was offsite, and were then left in waiting rooms for hours, often unattended. Gosnell is also serving time for a large-scale drug distribution outfit. He pleaded guilty to federal drug distribution charges in July. The dual businesses apparently made Gosnell a fortune over the 30 years he was carrying out abortions. Authorities said that the medical practice netted him about $1.8 million a year, and found $250,000 hidden in a bedroom when they searched one of his numerous properties.","Kermit Gosnell was found guilty on three murder counts, one manslaughter count, and many other crimes in May .

Charged: Donald Sachtleben was arrested for making the leak of classified information to an Associated Press journalist as well as the distribution of child pornography . A former FBI explosives expert has been charged with leaking the classified information about an upgraded underwear bomb involved in a foiled terrorist plot in Yemen. The leak led to a second controversy as it was revealed that the Attorney General’s office seized the Associated Press’ phone records when they were trying to discover the reporter’s source. Donald Sachtleben has plead guilty of revealing the information. He was also charged with distributing child pornography and now faces a total of 11 years and eight months behind bars for the two crimes. The Justice Department said in a statement that its pursuit of Sachtleben was made easier by the child pornography investigation, but that Sachtleben was not identified as a suspect in the leaks case until after investigators had analyzed the AP phone records and compared them to other evidence in their possession. The deal is the latest legal action in the Obama administration's aggressive pursuit of people it believes have revealed government secrets, including seeking records and even testimony of journalists who prosecutors believe were given classified information and then published stories about it. The information Sachtleben gave to the AP revealed that American intelligence agencies had learned that al Qaeda’s  branch in Yemen hoped to launch a spectacular attack using a new, nearly undetectable bomb aboard a U.S.-bound airliner around the anniversary of Osama bin Laden's death. The AP's May 7, 2012, story attributed details of the operation, including that the FBI had the bomb in its possession, to unnamed government officials. Tracked: The appearance of Sachtleben's email on a child pornography site helped investigators look into him but so did the fact that he appeared on AP call logs that were seized by the Attorney General's office . CIA Director John Brennan has called the leak 'irresponsible and damaging,' while Attorney General Eric Holder said the story was the result of 'a very serious leak, a very grave leak.' The intelligence officials argue that even though the terror plot had already been thwarted, by leaking the information it prevented the agencies from pursuing their leads further an potentially disrupting other planned attacks. Just over a year after the story appeared, on May 10, the Justice Department informed AP that it had secretly obtained nearly two months of call records for more than 20 telephone lines used by AP reporters and editors, including some who worked on the story. The news cooperative protested the government's actions as chilling to investigative journalism and the company and its reporters did not cooperate in the investigation. AP chief executive Gary Pruitt called the records' seizure a 'massive and unprecedented intrusion' into how news organizations gather the news. The court records do not identify AP or name the reporter who communicated with Sachtleben. Controversial: Attorney General Eric Holder's office approved the seizure of a widespread collection of Associated Press and other news organization's phone records in searches for leaks by government agents . Sachtleben spent 25 years as an FBI special agent bomb technician and worked on major cases involving terrorist attacks, the government said. He retired in 2008, but was rehired as an FBI contractor and kept his 'top secret' security clearance and access to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia. In court papers, Sachtleben said he visited the FBI lab on the morning of May 2, 2012, at the very time that FBI experts were examining the bomb. Sachtleben shared that information with a reporter the same morning, the government said. The AP story ran five days later, on May 7, 2012. The news organization had initially agreed, for several days, to the Obama administration's requests to hold off on publishing it. The child pornography investigation did not become public until May 11, when the FBI searched Sachtleben's home and seized a Sony laptop from his truck in the driveway. The FBI said it found 30 photos and videos of child pornography on the computer and Sachtleben was arrested the same day. The government said it began investigating Sachtleben for child pornography after an email address linked to him popped up on a known child-porn web site. Admitting guilt: Sachtleben entered a guilty plea on Monday for both the leaking and child porn charges and he will face 11 years and 8 months in prison . Sachtleben apologized in a brief, three-sentence statement that his attorneys released on his behalf Monday afternoon. 'I am deeply sorry for my actions,' he said. 'While I never intended harm to the United States or to any individuals, I do not make excuses for myself.' The Justice Department said it had already had in its possession, as part of the child pornography investigation, Sachtleben's cell phone, computer and other electronic media, including a CD/DVD containing classified information. But the department said in a statement that it was able to link Sachtleben to the unauthorized disclosures about the Yemen plot only after investigators had analyzed the seized AP phone records and compared them to other evidence already in their possession. Based on the analysis, they were able to get a search warrant for a new and more thorough look at his phone and computer, the department said. Around the same time that the government told AP its phone records had been obtained secretly, court records were made public that showed that prosecutors had obtained a search warrant for the emails of Fox News reporter James Rosen. The government says Rosen received secret information about North Korea from State Department adviser Stephen Kim, who faces criminal charges over the alleged disclosure. Kim's case is among seven the administration has brought against people suspected of providing classified information, more than under all previous presidents combined.","Donald Sachtleben was arrested and charged with leaking classified information and distribution of child pornography .

A seven-year-old girl was tragically killed in a ‘freak accident’ at a car hopping competition on Sunday night at the warehouse about 14 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. Mia Chapman was attending the event in Santa Fe Springs, California, along with her father, Jay, and an estimated 200 other people. Police haven’t confirmed that exact circumstances leading to Mia’s death, but according to eyewitnesses the event a car was exiting the warehouse when it lost control. Scroll down for video . Mia Chapman was tragically killed at a car hopping competition on Sunday night at the warehouse about 14 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles . Footage posted online of the car hopping event where Mia Chapman was killed on Sunday . ‘It was totally a freak accident. The car throttle got stuck when it was being moved to the trailer. It was not hopping. It was not performing in any shape or form,’ Andre Pierson of the National Lowrider Association told NBC4. To avoid a large group of spectators, the driver swerved and hit a stack of water bottles on pallets, estimated at 12 feet high and 500 pounds in weight. The pallets fell on Mia crushing her and she was pronounced dead at the scene. ‘It appeared there was a vehicle accident or a vehicle had struck a pallet rack inside that held several pallets of bottled water,’ Brent Hayward, a division chief for the Santa Fe Springs Fire Department, told Press-Telegram. Car hopping is when so-called low-rider cars show off their customized hydraulics systems - which can make the vehicles jump several feet in the air, often above the heads of surrounding audience members.

Car hopping is when so-called low-rider cars show off their customized hydraulics systems - which can make the vehicles jump several feet in the air, often above the heads of surrounding audience members . The event was held at a property belonging to CBM Hydros, formerly known as KoolAid Hydraulics, that installs the suspension systems required for hopping.

The heavily pregnant mother of a baby whose body was found buried in a yard in January was released from jail yesterday so she could give birth to her fourth child. Brittney Sierra, 22, from South Florida, was jailed in January for child neglect resulting in bodily harm after police found the skeletal reamins of her five-month-old son Dontrell Melvin buried in the back yard of her former home. The charges were downgraded yesterday to simple child neglect. She faces ten years in prison if convicted. Despite visiting the family's home up to 30 times, child welfare officials did not notice Dontrell was missing for 18 months. Scroll down for video . Release: Britney Sierra appeared in court yesterday handcuffed and heavily pregnant as a judge lifted her $100,000 bail . Brittney Sierra and Calvin Melvin Jr. both blamed each other for the death of their five-month-old son, Dontrell, whose skeletal remains were found buried in the back yard of their former home . Victim: Records show that a child welfare investigator visiting a South Florida home did not notice that five-month-old Dontrell Melvin was missing . Eventually, Sierra led them to the . baby's grave. The baby's father Calvin Melvin, 28, was also arrested on . child neglect charges. The judge yesterday agreed to reduce Sierra's $100,000 bail  to nothing. The conditions of her bail are that she remains confined to the house, wears a . GPS monitor, has no contact with Melvin or any unsupervised visits with . children under the age of 18, the Miami Herald reports. Sierra will stay with a woman who heard she was about to give birth, took pity on her and offered to take her in. Yolande Georges, was in court on Monday to assure the judge that Sierra was going to her Fort Lauderdale home. Defense lawyer H. Dohn Williams said Ms Georges passed a background check . and is able to provide Sierra with a stable and secure environment as . she awaits trial. But, according to the Miami Herald, she had a change of heart after the court hearing once she heard what Sierra has been accused of and said she only took her in as a favor to her mother Renee Menendez. 'I’m not involved in this at all anymore,' she said. 'I’m a servant of God, but no one told me what this was all about. I don’t want anyone to trick me.' She said she met Menendez three times before in recent months. When the two women talked, Menendez pleaded with Georges to let her daughter live with her upon release from jail, saying only that Sierra is not guilty of 'the accusation'. Smiles: The conditions of her bail are that she remains confined to the house, wears a GPS monitor, has no contact with Melvin or any unsupervised visits with children under the age of 18 . Sierra has two other children who have been taken into the custody of the Department of Children and Families. A child welfare investigator from the . sheriff's department in Broward County, where Dontrelle lived, went to . Sierra's home in September 2012 after a woman complained to the state abuse . hotline that the children were dirty and smelled, living in ‘horrible’ conditions, and that Sierra's younger sister brought a pornographic . magazine to school and drew male genitalia. Sierra and her two other children lived with her mother, Renee Menendez, and Sierra's four younger siblings, officials said. The investigator also visited the . children at school, interviewed them and determined there were no signs . of abuse or neglect, only that the house did smell a bit. The children . said they were fed and well cared for, according to DCF records. Documents released by the agency included a transcript of a call describing the deplorable . conditions at the house in Hallandale Beach — Menendez’s boyfriend . called the children ‘mother-----s’ and ‘bitches,’ the caller said, and . screamed that he would ‘knock them around.’ But DCF caseworkers reported time and again that there was no need for the agency to interfere. Although up to seven kids were . supposed to live at the house, an investigator who visited . the residence in September 2012 saw only the older children. The . official never set eyes on Dontrell, who was born in February 2011. Child welfare officials said the . agency had no interaction with the family while the baby was missing and . never received an abuse allegation about him. Grim task: Miramar Police investigate the crime scene in Hallandale Beach more than a year after a child went missing . Gruesome find: Remains that are believed to be those of Dontrell Melvin were unearthed in the backyard of the parents' former home . In Dontrell Melvin's case, records also indicate the agency had 30 prior contacts with the family. In 2011, a caller complained that . several of the children were riding a city bus alone to school each . morning, although they were picked up in the afternoon by their mother. Another hotline call last week . prompted the investigation that eventually led to the discovery of the . remains. That caller told hotline operators that people in the home . smoked drugs in front of the children and that a two-year-old was . running down the road naked and without shoes. The unidentified caller said the . mother's boyfriends were always around the house and that one hit the . children, according to the call. An investigator visited the home after . that and asked where baby Dontrell was. The father said the baby had . been living with his parents in Pompano Beach about 20 minutes away, but the parents . later said that was not true. Each parent has reportedly blamed the other in the disappearance of their son, Dontrell Melvin. Tragic: Dontrell Melvin was last seen in July 2011 his father left with him, but returned home alone . State child welfare officials have taken the other two children into custody. Each was born after Dontrell went missing. Police were still uncertain why relatives hadn't come forward before. 'Perhaps the parents were able to spin stories to different segments of . the family, that they believed the child was possibly being taken care . of by another segment of the family,' Flournoy said.

An Italian con man man who romanced Anne Hathaway before spending 4-1/2 years in federal prison for fraud was knee-deep in the world of Bill and Hillary Clinton before his arrest and a catastrophic downfall, a new report reveals. Raffaello Follieri, whom federal prosecutors sent to prison in 2008 for defrauding his backers, accepted a $50 million investment three years earlier from the Yucaipa Group, where Bill Clinton was the senior adviser, The New Republic reports. While the money was earmarked for buying properties from the Roman Catholic Church and converting them into commercial developments, Follieri spent much of it on himself and Hathaway. He also claimed to be the Vatican's chief financial officer at one point. Follieri's personal receipts later included $37,000 per month for an apartment complete with an executive chef and a private dog-walker, and at least one $107,000 jet rental for him and Hathaway to join the Clintons for New Year's Eve at Oscar de la Renta’s Dominican Republic estate. Happier times: Raffaello Follieri and Anne Hathaway were a pair in 2008 at the Oscars, but a few months later the fraudster was in handcuffs with a $21 million bail order . Band (R) rose from a White House internship to become the ultimate gatekeeper to Bill Clinton . Politico: Among Follieri's well-connected friends were Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain (L) and Terry McAuliffe (R), the Democrats' candidate for Virginia governor . 'In his recently published autobiography,' The Wall Street Journal reported in 2007, 'Terry McAuliffe, a Democratic Party leader who is now chairman of Sen. [Hillary] Clinton's presidential campaign, includes a group photo from a January 2006 party in the Dominican Republic resort of Punta Cana. It shows Mr. and Mrs. McAuliffe, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Ms. Hathaway and Mr. Follieri.' McAuliffe is now locked in a neck-and-neck Virginia gubernatorial election battle with the state 's Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli. Doug Band, Clinton's 41-year-old former 'body man,' became super-rich from his association with the former president and now owns a trio of adjoining New York City apartments valued at $10.3 million. Band's entree to the jet set came through Follieri, whose meteoric rise into New York's financial elite was fueled, prosecutors later found, by lies. 'Follieri courted Band by playing on his taste for the high life,' according to The New Republic. The fraudster invited Band and his then-girlfriend to fancy dinners and introduced them to the rich and famous. 'Band was exposed to another universe,' former Follieri publicist Melanie Bonvicino told the magazine. 'The cosmetics of it worked for everybody.' Band, who was -- and still is -- Bill Clinton's gatekeeper, reciprocated by bringing Follieri to meet the super-wealthy in the former president's inner circle, some of whom later invested with the con man. Once firmly inside the Bill Clinton Orbit, Follieri brought Hathaway within arm's reach of the former Oval Office charmer . Bill Clinton and his longtime pal billionaire Ron Burkle (R) put $50 million into Follieri's fabricated plan to buy up church properties, based on an introduction from Clinton 'body man' Doug Band . 'With Band’s help,' according to the lengthy article, 'Follieri got meetings with, among others, Clinton himself, Burkle, and Carlos Slim, the richest man in the world, aboard Slim’s yacht in the Sea of Cortez.' 'Slim declined to invest, but another introduction paid off: Through another Clinton contact, Keith Stein, Band hooked Follieri up with Michael Cooper, the head of Toronto-based Dundee Realty Corporation, who kicked in $6 million.' Burkle, a billionaire and long-time 'Friend Of Bill,' took a meeting with Follieri in 2005 and inked a deal to buy the church properties, based on the grifter's promise that he had special access at the Vatican. One year later, Yucaipa was suing for breach of contract. When that money came in, Follieri paid $400,000 to a shell company that Band had set up to allow businesses, including Yucaipa, to supplement his income so he could afford to work for Clinton on a relatively modest $110,000 salary. With that money in hand, Band and his brother Gregory made $4,600 contributions -- the maximum allowed at the time -- to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Band told The New Republic that he eventually repaid the $400,000 payoff, sending it to Cooper directly. But that development came in 2007, after Yucaipa sued Follieri and press inquiries began to percolate. In 2006, Follieri was also wooing at least one prominent Republican at the time: Arizona Sen. John McCain. A photograph published by the liberal magazine The Nation shows Follieri greeting guests while the senator walks up the gangplank of a yacht on his 70th birthday in 2006. Follieri had rented the boat for a month to sail the Adriatic Sea. McCain was in Montenegro as part of a congressional-delegation trip. Follieri once took Hathaway for an audience with Pope John Paul II, cementing his contrived image as a Vatican insider . 'A few months after McCain's yacht party,' The Nation reported, 'Follieri strengthened his ties to McCain's orbit by retaining Rick Davis's well-connected Washington lobbying firm, Davis Manafort, and offering Davis both an investment deal and help in securing the Catholic vote for McCain's presidential bid.' Once, at an annual meeting of the then-one-year-old Clinton Global Initiative, the former president seemed to give Follieri his own public imprimatur with an on-stage embrace. The rub: As former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton girds up for a 2016 presidential campaign, she can ill afford any hints of financial impropriety surrounding her famous political family . At the September 21, 2006 event, Clinton called the swindler to the stage and thanked him for a $50 million pledge, which was earmarked for vaccinating Honduran children against hepatitis A. That money never materialized. 'Why anyone would allow him to get close to Clinton and be on a stage saying he’s going to give $50 million away?' one Clinton insider told Vanity Fair two years later, speaking of Band. 'It’s absolutely nuts.' Band largely traded on his access to Clinton, The New Republic reported. In one case a company hoping for a Clinton speech at a conference approached Band for guidance. In addition to recommending a sizable donation to the Clinton Global Initiative, he also reportedly said the company should 'also pay you for having made that happen' 'Doug has always been reasonably commercial, let’s just say,' a former White House colleague said. 'He was a gatekeeper who charged tolls.' Follieri is now back in Italy, with his felony convictions for wire fraud, money laundering and conspiracy behind him. A spokesman for Hillary Clinton, the former U.S. senator who is now exploring a presidential run, did not respond to e-mailed questions about Band's role in her previous campaigns, and whether she ever benefited from Follieri's short-lived financial connections. Doug Band also has not responded to a phone message seeking comment.","Raffaelo Follieri, Hathaway's ex, spent 4-1/2 years in federal prison for defrauding investors .

The unprecedented trove of documents dating back to the start of the American civil rights movement is being sold by Dr King's former secretary Maude Ballou. The collection boasts handwritten notes from the 1959 speech Dr King gave at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Alabama announcing he was leaving to take up the equality fight in Atlanta. Write stuff: The collection includes a page from Martin Luther King's famous 'I Have a Dream' speech .

Inspirational: Final page of the 'I have a dream speech' Among the boxed up documents was a typed final page of the seminal ‘I Have a Dream’ speech. It was posted to Mrs Ballou, Dr King's secretary from 1955 to 1960, just weeks before he was assassinated on April 4, 1968, by sniper James Earl Ray in Memphis, Tennessee.

A woman whose bludgeoned body was found in the burning home of a family friend who allegedly killed her son and abducted her 16-year-old daughter died from at least a dozen blows to the head, according to an autopsy report released Monday. Christina Anderson, 44, was found with duct tape wrapped around her neck and mouth several times and her ankles tied with a plastic cable, the San Diego County Medical Examiner's Office said. Anderson had cuts in her neck that were likely inflicted through the tape after she died. The coroner said she died from blunt head trauma. The cause of death was undetermined for Anderson's 8-year-old son, Ethan, whose charred remains were found in the rubble. A family destroyed: Christina Anderson, left, and Ethan Anderson, right, are believed by authorities to have been killed by James DiMaggio . Investigators said they couldn't determine how Ethan died due to extensive burns and tissue loss. They said gunshot wounds, asphyxiation or burns from the house fire were all possibilities. James DiMaggio, 40, was killed by FBI agents in the Idaho wilderness Aug. 10, one week after he allegedly abducted 16-year-old Hannah Anderson and killed Christina and Ethan Anderson at his home in Boulevard, 65 miles east of San Diego. Hannah Anderson was rescued and returned safely to California. Christina Anderson asked DiMaggio to take Hannah to cheerleading camp Aug. 3 because she was at Ethan's football practice and unable to take her, San Diego County Sheriff's Detective Troy DuGal said in the autopsy report. Hannah's disappearance triggered a massive search spanning much of the western United States and parts of Canada and Mexico. Authorities have said DiMaggio set fire to his home with a timer, giving him a 20-hour jump on them.

"By . Peter Allen and Aaron Sharp . PUBLISHED: . 08:41 EST, 24 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:50 EST, 24 September 2013 . The French appeals court has ruled that an investigation into allegations that former president Nicolas Sarkozy duped L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt into donating election campaign funds can proceed. The decision, which could lead to a trial in the long-running scandal, complicates any political comeback by Sarkozy, who has been dogged for years by the 'Bettencourt affair' in which he denies any misconduct. Sarkozy is the French conservative voters' favourite to take on Socialist President Francois Hollande in 2017 after losing to him last year. Worried: Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, centre, is pictured leaving Bordeaux' courthouse . But he could suffer if he is tried over allegations of exploiting the mental frailty of France's richest woman. 'There is more chance of a trial on the horizon for Sarkozy, and as for his eventual return to politics, it's obviously a lot more complicated for him' political analyst Christophe Barbier told iTele. 'He is no longer master of his own calendar.' A lawyer for one of the 12 people investigated in the case said the decision would be appealed to the Cour de Cassation, the country's highest appeals court. Sarkozy's lawyers, who did not comment on Tuesday's decision, have five days to join that appeal.A final judgment by that court could take many months, but Sarkozy could be called to face trial at any time. Sarkozy was placed under formal . investigation in March for ""abuse of weakness"" of Bettencourt after she . was declared in a state of dementia. He was allegedly seeking funds for . his 2007 election campaign. Under . French law, a formal investigation means there is 'serious or . consistent evidence' pointing to likely implication of a suspect in a . crime. It often but not always leads to trial. The public prosecutor handling the case recommended in June that it be dropped for lack of evidence. Accused: Nicolas Sarkozy, left, was been told that charges of allegedly ‘abusing the weakness’ of the richest woman in the world, Liliane Bettencourt , right, can be investigated . In France, investigating magistrates can proceed with a formal inquiry over the objections of a prosecutor. The . appeal court's decision on Tuesday to proceed with the investigation . was announced to reporters outside the court in the southwest city of . Bordeaux by Nicolas Huc-Morel, the Bettencourt family lawyer. It . was prompted by a challenge mounted in July by lawyers for Sarkozy and . 11 others placed under investigation. They contested a 2011 medical . report that determined Bettencourt had been suffering from dementia . since 2006. Lawyers argued . the formal inquiry could not be viewed as impartial because one of the . doctors involved in the report was a friend of the judge who placed . Sarkozy under investigation, Jean-Michel Gentil. Defeat: Sarkozy and his third wife Carla Bruni leave the Elysee Palace . as current French president Francois Hollande and his partner Valerie . Trierweiler look on . 'Were . the (medical) expertise to have fallen through, it would have weakened . the case and the formal investigation could have caved in' Barbier said. 'In short, the main pillar in the Bettencourt case would have . collapsed.' Sarkozy has . largely stayed out of the limelight since his defeat to Hollande last . year, but has dropped hints this year that he is mulling a re-election . bid. Any comeback would . hinge on the outcome of the Bettencourt case and a series of other legal . cases involving people close to him, including alleged political . rigging in an arbitration payout to a high-profile businessman. When the charges were first brough, Sarkozy was said to be in a 'state of incomprehension'. The former French president has been charged with taking financial advantage of frail l'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt, 90. With his political career in ruins, Mr Sarkozy now faces a criminal trial and the possibility of going to prison. Nicolas Sarkozy's wife the model and singer Carla Bruni-Sarkozy performs at the Echo Music Awards in Berlin, Germany . Deapite his legal team was preparing to . appeal against the decision, political allies made it clear that he was . shell shocked as he returned from Bordeaux - where he was charged - to . the Paris home he shares with his third wife, former supermodel Carla . Bruni. 'As you can imagine he is in a state . of incomprehension,' said Jean-Francois Cope, president of Mr Sarkozy's . conservative UMP party. Francois Fillon, Mr Sarkozy's former . prime minister, went on to Twitter to say the decision was 'unfair' and . said 'the truth will triumph'. Mr Sarkozy's lawyer Thierry Herzog . also attacked the indictment as 'legally incoherent and unfair' saying . his client was being treated 'scandalously.' Mr Sarkzoy was unexpectedly summoned on Thursday to the Bordeaux offices of Jean-Michel Gentil, the judge in charge of the case. There he met at least four former . members of Bettencourt's staff, who said Mr Sarkozy regularly turned up . at the Bettencourt mansion in Paris to accept cash to help fund his 2007 . election campaign. Mrs Bettencourt's doctors say her . mental capacity began to deteriorate from the autumn of 2006, meaning . she would have been particularly vulnerable to people asking her for . money. The principal allegation is that Mr . Sarkozy obtained up to 4 million euros from her, breaching electoral . spending limits and taking advantage of a person weakened by ill health. Jean-Michel Gentil, the judge in . charge, hoped to establish today how many times Mr Sarkozy actually . visited Mrs Bettencourt’s luxury Paris home in the months before he was . elected. Mr Sarkozy insists that it was only once, despite many former Bettencourt staff members saying he was always popping round. Troubadour: Carla Bruni seen arrives back at home in Paris today. She has recently completed a new album called Little French Songs . The . principal allegation against Mr Sarkozy is that he took advantage of . the frail state of the aged widow to take money from her. Claire Thibout, Mrs Bettencourt’s . former accountant, told police in 2010 that she had handed cash-filled . envelopes to Bettencourt's financial manager, Patrice de Maistre, who . subsequently passed them on to Mr Sarkozy's campaign treasurer, Eric . Woerth. Mr Sarkozy is also said to have collected money in person. While Mr Sarkozy was being charged with the offences in Bordeaux, his wife Carla Bruni was in Berlin where she was performing at the Echo music awards. She is about to make a return to modelling starring in a campaign for Italian fashion house Bulgari. Top fashion photographer Terry Richardson reportedly photographed Bruni in Rome for the campaign this week. Ms Bruni has also recently completed a new album called Little French Songs in which she allegedly mocks current French Prime Minister Francois Hollande by referring to him as a penguin. Mr Sarkozy lost his immunity from . prosecution when he lost the 2012 presidential election to his Socialist . rival Francois Hollande. Within a few weeks, the home he shares with Ms Bruni was raided by anti-corruption police. In 2011, Mr Sarkozy's predecessor, . Jacque Chirac, was found guilty on corruption charges related to his . time as mayor of Paris, and received a two-year suspended prison . sentence. Since losing to Mr Hollande, Mr . Sarkozy had been trying to make money on the international conference . circuit, but he also hinted that he might return to power in 2017. But he faces numerous other . corruption enquiries, including claims that he took cash from Colonel . Gaddafi, the late Libyan dictator. Despite all this, Sarkozy has . regularly hinted that he may still make a bid to return to the Elysee . Palace in 2017. This now looks an impossibility. Mrs Bettencourt was recently listed as the richest woman in the world by Forbes magazine.","Former French president now faces possible prison sentence .

Witnesses to the April 18 shooting said they saw a masked gunman flee in a burgundy Peugeot 308 after killing Mr Eren, who had a month-old baby. Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh said: 'Today we need the public to help us trace and arrest Jamie Marsh-Smith. We are keen to speak to him in connection with the murder of Zafer Eren. 'We know that allegiances shift over time and now months on from Zafer's murder, people may have the confidence to talk to us.'

Two other shootings are being investigated as part of the same inquiry - one on April 22 in Tottenham, north London, where the victim managed to escape; and the other on December 30 2012 in Lower Edmonton, north London. Scotland Yard believes that Mr Eren's murder was part of violent tensions between the Tottenham Boys and the Bombacilar (Bombers) for control of the heroin trade in north London. So far a 20-year-old man has already been charged with the murder of Mr Efren and is due to stand trial at the Old Bailey on November 11.

Perelman has accused her uncle of stealing millions in inheritance from . her late grandfather, the newsstand millionaire Robert Cohen. Lawyers . for Samantha Perelman told a New Jersey probate court that James Cohen, . her late mother's brother, had tricked his father into cutting her out of his will. In . opening statements Paul Rowe, for Miss Perelman, claimed that there was . 'overwhelming' evidence that Mr Cohen took advantage of his ailing . father to seize control of the $800million Hudson News Company. Daddy's girl: Samantha Perelman, seen here at this year's Costume . Institute Gala with her billionaire father Ron Perelman, is suing her uncle James Cohen over a $600 million legacy left by her grandfather . Mr . Cohen denies the claims. His lawyer contended yesterday that Miss . Cohen, who at 23 is already a multimillionairess in her own right, was . scheming to deny Robert Cohen's only living child out of his . inheritance. The elder . Cohen, who died last year aged 86 after a 13-year battle with . Parkinson's built Hudson News into a retail empire starting with a . Newark, New Jersey news stand. After his death last year he left the company to his son James, who then sold it and collected $600million from the deal. Miss . Perelman is the daughter of former New York Daily News gossip columnist . Claudia Cohen, James Cohen's sister, who died in 2007 leaving her child . a $60million fortune. Meanwhile, . her father, Ron Perelman, is worth an estimated $12billion, made . through leveraged buyouts of companies and his stake in Revlon . cosmetics. Heiresses: Miss Perelman with her late mother, gossip columnist Claudia Cohen, in 2005. She claims that her mother's brother schemed to exclude her from her grandfather's will as he suffered from Parkinson's . Benjamin Clarke, . for James Cohen, told the court that his client's media mogul father . was 'not the kind of person you told what to do,' the New York Daily News reported. 'Robert . Cohen was the kind of person who told you what to do,' the lawyer said, . adding that the only possible exception to that was his 'little . cupcake' granddaughter, Miss Perelman. He . portrayed the plaintiff as greedy and selfish, claiming that she did . not even bother to see her grandfather in the final years of his life. 'She . wants to believe that she, the daughter of one of the wealthiest people . in the world, should [inherit] hundreds of millions of dollars . generated by the sale of a company that James Cohen, not Robert Cohen, . owned,' Mr Clarke told the court. Miss . Perelman's lawyer argued that it was Mr Cohen who was the greedy one, . alleging that he had taken advantage of his father's deteriorating . mental state to exclude his niece from her rightful inheritance. Robert . Cohen's decline began in 1999, said Mr Rowe, when the tycoon was . diagnosed with Parkinson's. In 2004 he was battling liver cancer and . that year also lost control of his limbs and bodily functions. By . 2009, the year he wrote his last will naming his son James as sole . beneficiary, the businessman was so incapacitated that he was unable . even to blink. A spokesman . for Miss Perelman has claimed that she was prevented from seeing her . ailing grandfather in the final years of his life. Family drama: James Cohen, seen here with his . wife, is battling niece Miss Perelman over millions she claims he . cheated her out of by coercing his late father to change his will. Mr Cohen denies the claim . Mr . Rowe has asked the court to throw out that will and reinstate one . written in 2004, which had left Claudia Perelman, Miss Perelman's late . mother, valuables including a 30-carat diamond ring worth $10million and . his private jet, as well as $25million in cash. Since Miss Perelman was the main beneficiary of her mother's estate she stands to inherit most of that fortune. Mr . Clarke countered that Robert Cohen had transferred Hudson News to his . son in a bit of nifty estate planning that helped avoid a big tax bill. He . also contended that the elder Cohen had been upset with his . granddaughter for challenging his mental competency in a previous case. Furthermore, he added, even under the 2009 will, Miss Perelman still stands to inherit the £10million ring. The case continues.","Samantha Perelman claims uncle coerced his father into changing his will to leave him the entire $800million Hudson News Company .

Anthony Howard, 46, allegedly told an underage boy he would give him hundreds of pounds a month if their relationship changed, a court heard today . A primary school head teacher fondled a teenage boy and offered him hundreds of pounds if their ‘relationship changed’, a court heard today. Andrew Howard, 46, is alleged to have showered him with presents and outings and asked the schoolboy to say he loved him, Winchester Crown heard. The offences were said to have taken . place at Howard’s home in Basingstoke, Hampshire, and in a car after Howard . was said to have confided in the boy, then under 16, that he was gay, the jury . heard. Howard, who was in charge of Velmead . Junior School in Fleet, Hampshire, but is now suspended, took the . youngster to football, cricket and tennis games and even bought Olympic . tickets. The headteacher, dressed in a black suit, checked shirt and tie, bowed his head in the dock as details of the allegations were revealed. Matthew Jewell, prosecuting, told the court that Howard, from Chineham, Hampshire, spent 'quite a lot of money' on treats and days out for the boy, but he crossed the line by touching the child in his car and on his sofa at his two-bedroom house during what he called 'sofa time'. He also offered to give the boy a monthly allowance if their relationship changed, the jury was told. The distressed child, then aged 14-15, told police the headteacher’s unwanted advances - including hugging him and not letting go - made him feel ‘uncomfortable’. The alleged victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons but who is not a past or present pupil at Velmead, is now 18 and is due to give evidence in court from behind a screen. Parts of his two-and-a-half hour police interview have been played to the jury of five men and seven women on DVD. Referring to a night in late 2010, the boy said Howard had told him he wanted an important chat. The alleged victim said: 'He said he was gay and in a relationship with a guy called Ian in Southampton for the last few years... Justice: A jury at Winchester Crown Court heard that the head-teacher denied the charges against him . 'Howard said he had to make a choice between staying with Ian and me.  He said he was attracted to me and was prepared to give me more money if the relationship between me and him changed. 'He also said because he was not with Ian any more, he wanted to hug me and kiss me.  He also said he didn’t want me to tell my parents and that was a fair thing to ask. 'I said ""Yes, that was fair"" because I felt uncomfortable.' Later that week, Howard offered to give the boy three different amounts of money a month ‘depending on what he decided’, the boy said. The boy added: 'He said he was prepared to give me  £150, £200 or £400 a month depending on what I decided. 'I said I didn’t want to talk about it because I didn’t want to find out what which option entailed.' The boy first made a complaint about Howard at the end of 2011 but no prosecution resulted from it. He claims Howard put his hand on his thigh and touched him sexually in the car and on the sofa.  In the car in June 2010, he alleges Howard told him he loved him and wanted him to ‘say that back’. 'When he was driving his hand would be on my thigh and touching my private bits and I expressed that I did not like that happening but he would carry on and say we would need to compromise over it' - the alleged victim in his police interview . He recalled how Howard would make him sit down and look through gifts he had bought him. The alleged victim said: 'He would want me to look through what he had got me and he called that ‘sofa time’. 'I did not like it but he just said it was what we had to do.' He added: 'There was a lot of feeling and touching which I did not like and expressed that. 'Where he was driving his hand would be on my thigh and touching my private bits and I expressed that I did not like that happening but he would carry on and say we would need to compromise over it.' As well as giving him cash for sweets and presents, Howard would ring him after 10pm at night, the trial heard. The child said: 'He was saying not to tell anyone and if I wanted anything to email him the [internet] links and he would get it for me and give it to me the next time he saw me.' Howard bought him a Samsung LG mobile phone on a rolling contract and then a Blackberry in August 2011, but cancelled this in August 2012, the court heard. He would sign off his text messages 'A' or 'MC2', which stood for the nickname 'Midnight Chum'. Howard was again interviewed by police last November when he made another complaint and the defendant was arrested and made a statement. Howard, who denies two charges of sexual activity with a child, was formally suspended from his post when the accusations came to light. The trial continues.

A 63-year-old fell runner died of hypothermia after he plunged 1,000ft in the Lake District after race officials lost count of the entrants, an inquest has heard. Brian Belfield, 63, disappeared while competing in the gruelling Buttermere Sailbeck Fell Run on April 28, 2012. But race officials only realised he had failed to finish the race when Mr Belfield’s wife Sandra, who was waiting for him at a guest house in Keswick, alerted them. An inquest at Cockermouth Coroners . Court heard a total of 133 runners entered the 9.5 mile race but a . mix-up meant organisers assumed only 132 runners had taken part. By . the time rescue crews began searching the mountainside weather . conditions were too bad and his body was found the next morning. Despite . falling down the mountainside, Mr Belfield suffered no broken bones but . died from exposure after landing in a freezing puddle. Cumbria . Deputy Coroner Robert Chapman said: 'The post-mortem was clear in . stating a number of cuts, bruises and abrasions to his body which . indicated injuries from sliding rather than a fall. 'There . were no broken bones. It may be that he was unconscious which explains . why he did not attempt to get out of the pool of water.' The . inquest heard Mr Belfield - a member of Staffordshire Moorlands . Athletics Club - had set off wearing a thermal top and also had a . whistle and a compass. Three runners abandoned the arduous mountain run, including one early withdrawal. Delay: A search party wasn't launched for Mr Belfield until his wife alerted race organisers that he hadn't returned to their hotel in Kewsick in the Lake District (stock image pictured) Race organiser Michael Robinson told the inquest he used his radio to tell marshals about the early withdrawal and then asked a spectator to relay the message to volunteer marshals at the fifth and final checkpoint. He then went to the finishing line before heading off to organise the prize-giving while participants still crossed the line. Mr Robinson said: 'With hindsight I think that with one dropping out so early the figure of 132 has stuck with some people.' Mrs Belfield, from Leek, Staffordshire, attended the inquest with the couple’s children Tracy and Andrew. She said her husband had started running about 15 years ago. She said: 'He always did it as a hobby and wasn’t one of the elite racers. The last time I saw him was about 11.40am when he went off to the race. I usually expected him back after about four hours but he never returned.' The inquest continues.","Brian Belfield entered the Buttermere Sailbeck Fell Run in April 2012 .

During the winter months, the path to Tobermory is impassable, making the cottage accessible only by boat.

Remote: The lighthouse is a mile away from the nearest town, but estate agents say its isolation is made up for by the stunning views . Views: The cottage is one mile north of Tobermory, Scotland and has views over the Sound of Mull and the old lighthouse . The cottage has four bedrooms, a sitting room, study, parlour, WC, washroom and seven storerooms, and when the weather is at its worst, the occupant requires a boat to come and go. The only water supply is from a private spring on the estate, while heat is provided by solid fuel fires or stoves and light by paraffin lamps or gas lamps. The home, which has not been lived in . for years, boasts 80 acres of surrounding land and a mile of untouched . shore front which includes the Rubha nan Gall lighthouse.It was put on the market for £225,000 with property agents Bell Ingram. Limited resources: The cottage does not have mains electricity and the only available water is from a spring located on the 80-acre estate . Surroundings: The cottage, which looks out onto the lighthouse, is only accessible by boat during the winter because the path leading to it becomes flooded and freezes over . Keeper: The Rubha nan Gall cottage still contains the keys to the lighthouse, but the buyers access to the landmark would be restricted . A spokesperson for the estate agency’s Oban office said: 'This is definitely a unique property which offers superb potential for a buyer who is really looking for the ultimate get-away-from-it-all property, or the buyer who is looking for a property in a stunning setting that can be developed into a luxury home.'The house in its current state offers a . real back-to-basics living experience - and while this may be appealing . to some buyers, there is potential for the property to be extensively . modernised.

Beautiful: The lighthouse one mile north of Tobermory on the Ardnamurchan Peninsula is inaccessible in winter but has spectacular views out over the Sound of Mull . 'In winter the pathway is either turned into mud or ice and becomes impassable. The only way to travel to and from the cottage in winter months is by boat via the landing jetty.' The spokesman insisted the price tag is all worth it for the stunning views and wildlife in the area.He added: 'Mull is famed across the UK and further afield for its rugged natural beauty and awe-inspiring coastline. 'To accompany the scenery, Mull has an incredible variety of wildlife including golden eagles, herds of red deer, and otters can occasionally be seen basking in the sheltered bays and dining on brown trout.'

From the little girl playing on the pier at Ramsgate to the suited and booted sunbather, his eyes covered in a tissue, late photographer Tony Ray-Jones was an expert at capturing the English on film in all their eccentric glory. Now the work of the Somerset-born shutterbug will go on display for the first time in London in an exhibition at the Science Museum. Among the 118 images to feature, most of which date from the 1960s, are 55 rarely seen snaps, including one that shows holidaymakers posing with their caravan in Morecambe and another that features day-trippers relaxing by their car in Worthing. Suited for sunbathing: This 1968 shot shows a smartly dressed holidaymaker on the beach in Blackpool . Happy holiday: A group of men with their caravan on the cliffs near Morecambe in Lancashire in 1967 . Between 1966 and 1969, Ray-Jones created a body of work documenting English customs and identity. 'Tony Ray-Jones' pictures were about England,' says Martin Parr, a contemporary whose work, dating from the 1970s, also features in the exhibition. 'They had . that contrast, that seedy eccentricity, but they showed it in a very . subtle way. They have an ambiguity, a visual anarchy. They showed me . what was possible.' They quickly attracted the attention of the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, where they were exhibited in 1969. But Ray-Jones' career was cut tragically short when he died from Leukaemia aged just 30 in 1972.

Captain Walter Barrie was shot dead by a rogue member of the Afghan army as he played football on Remembrance Day . A British soldier was shot dead at close range by a rogue member of the Afghan army while playing a football match on Remembrance Day, an inquest has heard. Captain Walter Barrie was playing alongside members from the Afghan National Army (ANA) at his base when he was killed in the Nad-e Ali district of Helmand province. The gunman, named as Mohammad Ashraf, was dressed in full ANA uniform when he approached the pitch and fired nine shots towards Capt Barrie using an M16 rifle. As the other soldiers fled, the gunman moved towards a welfare tent for British troops and continued firing, the hearing at Oxford Coroner’s Court was told. The attack on November 11 last year was stopped when the Afghan soldier, described as being in his late teens or early 20s and of slim build with a beard, was shot dead by Isaf (International Security Assistance Force) soldiers, the inquest heard. Intelligence officers had warned . British troops of insider attacks after a similar incident in western . Afghanistan on November 10. Sixty per cent of insider attacks are followed by another within 72 hours, the hearing was told. Information which emerged in the days after . Capt. Barrie’s death suggested that the gunman’s brother had been shot by the . Spanish Army in Badghis province in the north west of Afghanistan just . 24 hours before the killing at FOB Shawqat. It is speculated that Ashraf may have carried out his attack in revenge for his brother getting wounded. Capt Barrie, from Penicuik in Midlothian, had been mentoring and advising a brigade of the ANA to take over security in an area of southern Afghanistan before he was killed in the 'green-on-blue' attack. The 41-year-old, of The Royal Scots Borderers, 1st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, had served for 25 years, including tours of Iraq, Bosnia, Kosovo, Northern Ireland and Afghanistan in 2008. A post mortem examination revealed he died from a gunshot wound to the chest. In a statement read to the court, consultant forensic pathologist Dr Nicholas Hunt said the injury had caused 'extremely rapid loss of consciousness and death'. Unsuspecting: Captain Barrie was participating in a football match with Afghan soldiers in Helmand (stock image of a match in Afghanistan pictured) when the lone gunman launched his attack . Private Ryan Houston, who was on duty as a 'Guardian Angel' to patrol the base, told the hearing that he was alerted to the attack when he heard 'a burst of fire'. 'I turned in the direction of the football pitch but I did not see the person holding the weapon,' he said. 'Capt Barrie was not moving and appeared motionless. I think I shouted ""man down"".' A smoke grenade was thrown onto the pitch to conceal Capt Barrie’s body from the killer and allow medics to reach him, the inquest heard. Colour Sergeant George Parker told the inquest that, after hearing the shots, he exchanged fire with the Afghan soldier who then turned and ran off. Col Sgt Parker and Pte Houston later approached the soldier as he lay on the floor with a gunshot wound to the head. 'I could see he was injured,' Pte Houston said. 'He was alive, he was making gasping sounds.' Andrew Lumley, Officer Commanding D . Company, 1 Scots, told the inquest that the shooter had been based at a check . point 150 metres from the base and had gained access by an entrance . controlled by the ANA. He revealed the shooting came just 24 hours after a similar attack in Badghis - in which the gunman's brother may have been injured. Maj Lumley said: 'It had been briefed on . that day on November 10 about a green-on-blue in Badghis provice in . North West Afghanistan where the Spanish Army is the ISAF force. 'There was no intelligence as such that linked the individual in that green-on-blue with anyone in Helmand.' Tragic: . Captain Walter Barrie, pictured with son Callum, had served with the . army for 25 years - including tours of Iraq, Bosnia, Kosovo, Northern . Ireland and Afghanistan - when he was killed . He went on: 'Over the days that came after Capt Barrie’s death, more information came out about the individual involved. 'As far as we know, it eventually transpired the individual in Badghis was related to Mohammed Ashraf. I believe he had been wounded.' Col Sgt Parker said relations with members of the ANA on the base were 'generally very good' and they would play football with British troops on an almost daily basis. Since Capt Barrie’s death, two Guardian Angels and a Guard Commander are now employed at the base and improvements have been made to communications, he added. Recording his verdict, Oxfordshire coroner Darren Salter said Capt Barrie was unlawfully killed while on active service. 'It does appear the individual acted alone and there has been no evidence linked to insurgents or the Taliban,' he said. Mr Salter said finding the motive behind the killing involved 'a degree of speculation', although it was thought to have been linked to an earlier insider attack on Spanish troops in Afghanistan in which the rogue soldier’s brother was wounded. 'It may be Mohammad Ashraf was concerned and motivated by that, although we’ll never know for sure,' he added. The fatal shot was most likely to have been inflicted while Capt Barrie was lying face down on the ground, causing an “extremely rapid loss of consciousness” which led to his death, the coroner said. Mr Salter described Capt Barrie as a 'highly experienced' soldier who was 'held in high degree' by the Afghan troops he trained, and offered his condolences to Capt Barrie’s wife Sonia and teenage son Callum.","Captain Walter Barrie served with the Royal Scots Borderers for 25 years - including tours of Iraq, Bosnia, Kosovo, Northern Ireland and Afghanistan .

"By . Steve Nolan . PUBLISHED: . 11:41 EST, 24 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:25 EST, 24 September 2013 . A couple whose day-old baby died at a scandal hit maternity unit almost a decade ago have accused hospital staff of an 'unforgiveable cover-up' of failings that led to her death. Elleanor Bennett was just 27 hours old when she died at the Furness General Hospital in February 2004. Though her death certificate stated she died of natural causes, the case was referred to the South Cumbria Coroner in March of this year after a police investigation into a number of baby and mother deaths at the hospital. Devastated: Lesley and Gary Bennett have accused staff at Furness General Hospital of an 'unforgiveable cover-up' over the death of their baby daughter Elleanor . An inquest held almost nine years after her death found that she died of 'as a consequence of complications during the birthing process.' The hearing at Barrow Town Hall heard that a midwife failed to take Elleanor's heartbeat for 43 minutes during labour and that she had to be resuscitated when she was finally born. She suffered continuous fits and was transferred to Liverpool Women’s Hospital but died in her father’s arms the next day. Although an internal investigation into Elleanor's death found failings by midwife Marie Ratcliffe, the Bennett family were never informed. Coroner Ian Smith today criticised the actions of University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay Trust for failing to 'bite the bullet' and not explaining to Lesley and Gary Bennett how their daughter died. Eleanor's parents today called for the NHS to ensure a robust duty of candour is implemented so that the same mistakes don't happen again. The two-day inquest was told that Mrs Bennett’s third pregnancy went smoothly before she went into labour a week overdue. She had been classified as high risk because of her high body mass index and scans had showed it was anticipated to be a large baby. 'Cover up': Coroner Ian Smith was critical of the failure of Furness General Hospital, pictured, to tell Mr and Mrs Bennett how their baby died following a damning internal investigation . Her waters were broken by a male registrar at 8.05pm on February 25 but he did not enter the maternity room again. Ten minutes later, Elleanor's heartbeat was noted as being 'perfectly satisfactory. But despite national guidelines ruling that a baby's heart rate must be checked every five minutes, Elleanor's was not monitored again by Ms Ratcliffe for the next 43 minutes. When the midwife was unable to find a heartbeat via a cardiotocography (CTG) machine and a hand-held sonic aid device at around 8.45pm, she asked for help from a senior midwifery colleague. 'An opportunity to get Elleanor out quicker was missed and obviously that was crucial to what happened.' Coroner Ian Smith . The baby was born 13 minutes later, weighing 10lbs 10ozs, but had turned blue by the time she was placed on her mother's stomach. Coroner Mr Smith criticised the staff for not immediately contacting the duty doctor and missing an opportunity to potentially save Elleanor's life. Mr Smith said it was not as if the doctor was unavailable to assess the situation. He said: 'That would have given them the opportunity to get the baby out as soon as possible by whatever means you can whether through forceps delivery or caesarean. 'That opportunity to get Elleanor out quicker was missed and obviously that was crucial to what happened.' He said it was 'most likely' that Elleanor was starved of oxygen and suffered brain damage during the 43-minute period she went unchecked. Failings: An internal review carried out by the hospital's then head of midwifery was 'thorough' and 'pulled no punches' according to the coroner, but Mr and Mrs Bennett were left in the dark . The hearing was told that an internal review was carried out by the health trust in 2004 and criticised the actions of Ms Ratcliffe, who was sent on a two-day training course, but the Bennetts were unaware of the investigation. The investigation, carried out by the hospital's then head of midwifery Denise Fish was 'thorough' and 'pulled no punches', said Mr Smith. A memo written by Miss Fish as part of the review stated if the case went to litigation then expert witnesses would certainly query the 43-minute gap in the heart rate measurement. It went on that if she did not know that Ms Ratcliffe was a competent and experienced staff member then she would have concluded 'there was negligence by omission'. 'The consequence of all of that is we are . all here today nearly 10 years later carrying out an investigation that . should have happened eight or so years ago.' Coroner Ian Smith . The coroner remarked: 'That is a very straight and damning piece of evidence which said there was a delay and there should not have been.' He added: 'I think someone should have bit the bullet and said (to the Bennetts) ""we really need to level with you and let you know why Elleanor did not survive"" and they did not do that. 'The consequence of all of that is we are all here today nearly 10 years later carrying out an investigation that should have happened eight or so years ago.' The police probe into Elleanor's death was launched three months after an inquest in June 2011 held by the same coroner into the death of baby Joshua Titcombe. Mr Smith ruled Joshua died of natural causes nine days after his birth at the hospital in October 2008 but that midwives had repeatedly missed opportunities to spot and treat a serious infection. Speaking after the hearing, the Bennetts, from Dalton-in-Furness, said: 'We were told that her death was one of those things and that no procedures could be changed to prevent it from happening again. Scandal hit hospital: The police investigation into Elleanor's death begun after an inquest into the death of another baby, Joshua Titcombe (pictured with sister Emily), who also died at Furness . 'With the help of family and friends we tried to rebuild our lives for the sake of our other children. 'In October 2011, the police came to our door to tell us that they were investigating a number of deaths at Furness General Hospital, and that Elleanor’s was one of those cases. 'Since then, we have found out so much that was never revealed to us and this has totally devastated our entire family. We have had to restart the grieving process all over again. 'We now have the truth about what went wrong that night and this means we can try again to move on as a family and Elleanor can now rest in peace. 'We hope that lessons can be learned and that her death will not have been in vain. We urge the Government to ensure that the duty of candour is implemented and robustly enforced within the NHS. 'Our wish is that no family should have to go through what we have. 'We understand that nobody meant for this to happen, but to lie, cover up the mistakes and fail to learn from them is unforgiveable.' George Nasmyth, Medical Director of University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust apologised to the family following the inquest and said that lessons had been learned. He said: 'We extend our sincere condolences to baby Elleanor Bennett's family. For any family to lose a loved one is an absolute tragedy and having to revisit a very painful time from 2004 is extremely difficult. 'We understand that nobody meant for this . to happen, but to lie, cover up the mistakes and fail to learn from . them is unforgiveable.' Lesley and Gary Bennett . 'Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to them. 'We acknowledge that full information wasn't shared with the family at the time of Elleanor's death and we apologise for this. 'We have now improved our systems to ensure that in similar circumstances, information is shared with the family concerned as soon as possible. 'We have accepted that some of the care provided to Mrs Bennett in 2004 during the course of her labour and delivery was inappropriate and that steps should have been taken to deliver Elleanor sooner. 'We fully accept the Coroner's conclusion that Elleanor died as a result of complications during the birthing process, and we are sincerely sorry for this.' 'During the last 12 months significant progress has been made with a new Trust Board in place and clinicians leading changes in the way we operate. 'A new clinical leadership team for our maternity services has a clear vision of providing safe and excellent care which will meet the needs and expectations of mothers and babies.'","Elleanor Bennett died 27 hours after her birth in February 2004 .

A third of people have no idea who wrote Great Expectations, a worrying survey of reading habits has revealed. One in six were also unable to name the genius behind Hamlet. Dickens and Shakespeare are not the only major authors to fall out of favour with large sections of the population - 28 per cent of adults admitted never having read one of the classics. One in seven revealed they hadn’t read a single book over the past 12 months. The findings suggest not only that many people have managed to complete their education without study any classical literature in detail but that the habit continues into adulthood. Just 12 per cent have read Much Ado About Nothing, 18 per cent Catcher in the Rye and only 26 per cent have picked up Pride and Prejudice - despite its enormous popularity as prime time television drama and in the cinema. A quarter of adults have read fewer than five books over the past year and the average gets through seven, according to the survey of 2,000 people. Half of those who complete fewer than ten books every year blamed lack of time and a quarter said they had more interesting things to do. Around one in eight said they were a slow reader and a similar proportion simply said they didn’t like reading. Bedtime is when most people pick up a book, with just under half finding time when they’re between the sheets. A third catch up on reading while on holiday. Only a quarter said they flick through a few pages whenever they get a chance. The favourite genre is thrillers (30 per cent), followed by crime novels (26 per cent). Romance novels are favoured by 16 per cent - although this comprises 29 per cent of women and just two per cent of men. The most popular book from contemporary literature is the Da Vinci Code, which 36 per cent of people have read. The Harry Potter series came second with 28 per cent. James Endersby, managing director of Opinium Research, which carried out the survey, said: ‘Unfortunately for many people, reading is now a luxury and something which they cannot commit a great deal of time to. ‘Over the summer, many will have taken the opportunity to relax with a good book and have hopefully reminded themselves how much they enjoy reading. What would be great is if everyone decided to pick one classic book to read during the winter months.’ Just 18 per cent have read Catcher in the Rye and only . 26 per cent have picked up Pride and Prejudice - despite its enormous . popularity as prime time television drama and in the cinema . Modular exams have allowed pupils to read sections of books instead of the entire work.

Secondary school pupils will be required to study at least two Shakespeare plays and a 19th-century novel at GCSE and cover the works of two authors in depth each year.

The mites spread through the school and jumped across tables - leaving staff and pupils with sore and itchy bites. Infestation: Walney School in Barrow-in-Furness has been forced to close for a second time after its first attempt to rid its £6million grass eco-roof (above) of a mite infestation has failed to stop them biting children . Ongoing issue: The mites have spread through the 700-pupil secondary school in Cumbria - leaving staff and pupils with sore and itchy bites . The 700-pupil Cumbria secondary school reopened on Monday after a full-scale fumigation was thought to have cleared up the problem. However, students have now been sent home for a second time after it became apparent that the bugs - believed to be harvest mites - were still biting children. Katherine Turner, whose daughter attends the school, said she felt its duty of care to students had been 'breached'. She said: 'They knew about this a week ago. Parents should have been told earlier. It shouldn't have reopened until it was sorted.' Irritable: Harvest mites sink in a small feeding barb to their victims and secrete a fluid into the wound. Their bites cause extremely irritating heat lumps which can last up to fourteen days . The influx of mites is believed to have emerged from the school's £6million eco extension, which comprises of ten classrooms and a new sports hall. It opened 12 months ago, featuring ‘natural ventilation’ and a sedum grass roof. The school's chairman of governors Dennis Laird said: 'On Friday afternoon, the interior of the building was treated by our contractor. The effect of this was assessed on Saturday afternoon and again on Sunday. 'These mites are extremely small and as far as could be discerned it appeared that the issue had been dealt with. 'However, upon reopening it became apparent that pupils were still being affected and the problem remained. Unfortunately we had to make the decision to reclose the school.'

Their aim is to promote sustainable and environmentally friendly development - but not all parents are fans of so-called 'eco-schools'. This month, families have voiced their concerns about a £7million 'eco primary school' that, despite opening only three years ago, has started leaking so badly pupils have been forced to go into temporary classrooms for two years. Controversial: Dartington Primary School (above) has started leaking so badly that pupils have been forced to go into temporary classrooms for two years . When Dartington Primary School in Devon opened its timber doors in 2010, it was applauded for its environmentally friendly credentials. It was heated by solar power and its plumbing system relied on rain collected from the roof, which was made of locally-grown sweet chestnut. However, the zero-carbon building turned out to be not quite as sustainable as the designers had hoped. Now, a series of water leaks and mouldy walls have left pupils having to be taught in tents erected in the school grounds. Tania Mountney, whose son attends the school, near Totnes, said: ‘There’s been leaking there ever since it opened. Last year we could see the roof was starting to warp. 'I went to a parents’ lunch and you could see these large patches of mould. My ex-partner is a builder and he couldn’t understand how it could get that bad.’ Meanwhile, a South Wales 'eco primary school' has banned pupils from bringing their bikes through the gates because of health and safety concerns. Students at Risca Primary School in Newport have been told they must chain their bikes up off its premises amid plans to demolish cycle racks to make way for more staff parking. Mother Ceri Jeffries, 32, has three 10-year-olds at the school and admitted she was surprised staff had taken the decision considering its 'eco' status. 'The school is an eco-friendly school but has decided that children are no longer allowed to cycle to and from school, even though children have been doing this for years, including myself as a child,' said the mother, whose children normally cycle together with four others, cutting their twenty minute walk down to a five-minute bike ride. 'This has upset a lot of children and their parents. Childhood obesity is on the rise and promoting healthy eating and exercise is a must.' Last month, the 'eco-schools' initiative had been implemented in 55 countries, with more than 46,000 schools taking part. Its aim is to raise students' awareness of sustainable and environmentally friendly development through classroom study and community action.","Walney School in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, was closed on Friday due to an infestation of mites .

Too much: Michael Mansfield QC, pictured, was told to calm down his questioning of a witness at the Mark Duggan inquest . A top barrister was told to calm down after he was accused of being ‘too combative and aggressive’ during his questioning of a witness yesterday. In a highly unusual move, the 11 jury members passed a note to the judge expressing their alarm over the conduct of Michael Mansfield, QC, at the inquest into Mark Duggan. Judge Keith Cutler interrupted Mr Mansfield during his aggressive questioning of a senior police officer and told him to calm down. The judge said: ‘I’m concerned that you are getting much too combative and much too aggressive. That is the note I’ve got from the jury. ‘I think that it would be better if we had a very calm, considered investigation.’ Mr Mansfield, a leading Left-wing barrister who has represented a string of high-profile clients, spent several hours yesterday questioning Acting Superintendent Michael Foote about his role in Duggan’s shooting, which sparked the 2011 summer riots. In scenes reminiscent of a TV courtroom drama, Mr Mansfield often shouted his questions at the officer when he failed to get the response he was looking for. During the hostile interrogation, Hugo Keith, the QC representing the Metropolitan Police, repeatedly rose to his feet to object to the style of questioning. Judge Cutler also interrupted Mr Mansfield on several occasions before finally warning him to calm down. The aggressive line of questioning directed towards Mr Foote - an officer with 29 years of experience - was continued by human rights barrister Leslie Thomas, who also represents Duggan’s family. During his questioning Mr Thomas told the court that police have to take heed of Article 2 of the Human Rights legislation which states that everyone has a right to life. Unprecedented: Judge Keith Cutler, pictured, was passed a note by the jury regarding the QC's questioning . He told Mr Foote: ‘Even criminals have rights. You know that each subject has a right to life.’ Judge Cutler then admonished Mr Thomas for ‘giving a speech on the law’ instead of asking relevant questions. The aggressive cross examination by both Mr Mansfield and Mr Thomas focused on the three days leading up to the fatal shooting of Duggan in Tottenham, north London, on August 4, 2011. The father-of-four, who had taken the party drug Ecstasy, was shot twice by a police marksman as he ran out of a Toyota minicab. Inquest: The cross examination focused on the three days leading up to the fatal shooting of Duggan, pictured, in August 2011 . Officers who confronted Duggan claim he was holding a gun when he was shot. A pistol was later recovered up to 20 feet away from Duggan’s body. Duggan, a member of the notorious Tottenham ManDem gang, is alleged to have picked up a handgun from Kevin Hutchinson-Foster in Leyton, east London, 15 minutes before he was shot. Mr Foote, who was in charge of the Met’s gang unit in north-west London, was repeatedly asked why his team did not seize the gun off Hutchinson-Foster before he passed it to Duggan. The officer told the Royal Courts of Justice that the reason officers did not intervene earlier was because they did not know where the gun was being stored. He added: ‘If we knew [Hutchinson-Foster] had it in his possession then we would have [taken action], but we didn’t have that type of specific intelligence.’ Mr Foote said the reason it was so important to get guns off the streets was to . prevent ‘innocent members of the public from being caught up in gang feuds’. He highlighted the shooting of Thusha Kamaleswaran, who was five years old when she was left paralysed by a bullet fired a gangster as she danced in a grocery store aisle in front of her parents in Stockwell, south London. He added: ‘They are the sort of incidents that we are trying to prevent.’ At one point Mr Mansfield claimed the Duggan operation was badly planned and inadequately supervised. Mr Foote said: ‘In my view the operation was properly planned. This is something we do on a regular basis. In these type of operations, subjects that are under observation lead chaotic lifestyles. ‘Sometimes they don’t do what you expect them to do. We are reacting to spontaneous events.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Jury passed a note to Judge Keith Cutler about Michael Mansfield QC .

Critical: Johnson said well-off Britons should give their wealth to charity rather than passing large homes on to their children . Boris Johnson yesterday criticised well-off Britons who buy large houses to pass on to their children instead of giving their wealth to charity. He said the country needed to adopt a culture of philanthropy like that of the US, where there is a ‘culture of giving and being recognised as givers’. Despite owning a large house in Henley, Oxfordshire, and a £2.3million home in a fashionable part of North London, the father-of-five criticised those who ‘desperately’ aimed to amass property wealth to pass on to their offspring ‘for some unknown reason’. The former Conservative MP earns £143,911 as London Mayor, and four years ago described the £250,000 he is paid for writing a column in a national newspaper as ‘chicken feed’. He has also written several books, from which he earns an income. Critics last night claimed his comments were hypocritical, given the Eton-educated mayor’s privileged upbringing. Labour MP Simon Danczuk said: ‘I’m sure lots of people who’ve worked hard and want to pass on something to their children will not take kindly to being lectured by an over-privileged politician like Boris who’s been living pretty high on the hog his whole life. The way to encourage philanthropy is certainly not by going around insulting people. Boris really should know better.’ Mr Johnson was speaking in London alongside philanthropic New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, who was launching a competition to offer £4.2million to any European city that comes up with innovative ideas to solve urban problems. Asked what he believed the barriers were to philanthropy in Britain, Mr Johnson said wealthy Britons just wanted to buy the largest ‘schloss’ – a castle or manor house – they could, adding: ‘It’s a cultural thing. The trouble with the people in this country is – and I’ll get myself in terrible trouble here – is that what they really want to do when they’ve amassed colossal wealth in Britain, is buy the biggest possible house they can with the most colossal grouse moorland they can find and then try in some desperate way to perpetuate it and to pass it on to their children, for some unknown reason. Nice place: One of two properties owned by Boris Johnson - a north London town house . ‘In America they have a very different attitude in that they believe that if you have made a lot of money you should do something for society. ‘There’s still something in Britain which regards giving on a huge scale as somehow ostentatious – that is absolutely ridiculous. ‘The sooner people get over their lust to buy great schlosses in the home counties – or indeed grouse moors – and give to great causes in London, the better.’ The three-times New York mayor Mr Bloomberg, who is a multi-billionaire media mogul, has given much of his wealth to good causes. He said: ‘Some places in Europe look down on private philanthropy, arguing it takes away the responsibility of the Government. ‘That’s misguided because the government should do conventional things with the public’s money, but society needs innovation and risk-takers and that’s where private philanthropy fits in.’","Mayor of London said Britain must adopt a culture of philanthropy, like US .

By . this time he was in a £750 navy blue suit from British designer label . Spencer Hart – whose fans include rapper P Diddy, David Bowie, Jimmy . Carr and Benedict Cumberbatch. The high end High Street brand is also a favourite of Samantha Cameron and the Duchess of Cambridge, and the fitted floral dress is part of a slick new wardrobe that Justine has deployed for the annual event at a crucial time in her husband's political career. To give her Young Labour speech on Monday the mother-of-two chose a classic black flared dress worn with LK Bennett heels and statement jewellery. Earlier in the week, she took to the stage telling Labour activists how the couple met, and why she thought he should run for the leadership, as party bosses admitted she ‘comes across better than him’. On the first day of the Labour conference the couple took their sons Daniel, four, and Samuel, two, to play on the beach in front of the cameras. Gordon Brown never posed for pictures with his children and, according to the memoirs of Damian McBride, even criticised David Cameron. Mr Brown thought the Tory leader used his family as ‘props’. Previously Justine has been one of the more reticent political WAGs but is stepping up her involvement as Ed's poll ratings plummet . Justine wore a cherry red mac to walk through Brighton city centre in one of several photo opportunities during the Labour conference and chose a simple flared dress to give her 'more than a dress' speech . Justine was also snapped in a vivid red mac and smart black trousers on a photo . opp tour of the city with husband Ed in his 'smart casual' best on . Friday. Although always a stylish dresser, previously the child actress-turned barrister has been one of the more reticent politcal WAGs, and Ed has repeatedly claimed he would not . copy David Cameron’s habit of eye-catching photo opportunities while . opposition leader, and would instead focus on policies. But party strategists plan to put Justine . on the political frontline in the run up to the 2015 election and this week the Justine and Ed show has been unleashed on the world. The decision to bring Mrs Miliband into the . political fray has drawn comparisons with failed attempts by Gordon . Brown and Iain Duncan Smith to use their other halves to rescue their . leadership. As Justine promises to speak out publicly about why her husband of nine years should be Prime Minister, the Milliband children too have been . wheeled out in front of the world's press, swinging arm in arm along . Brighton beach like a mini Boden campaign. Brothers Daniel, four, and Samuel, two, have even been labelled as the party's secret conference weapon.

The couple have been snapped in a series of stage managed photo opportunities designed to humanise the Labour party leader . The couple met in 2004, but didn't get married until 2011 when Justine chose an understated Temperley dress with no veil. As well as revealing her plans to take to the 'barricades' in support of husband in 2015 the environmental lawyer also revealed the . moment she realised she had fallen for him – while rearranging . chairs in a hall in Doncaster. She told delegates: ‘In May 2005, Ed was the prospective parliamentary candidate for Doncaster North. I was his friend. ‘So . I went to Doncaster to help him campaign and I was moving chairs around . in a hall getting ready for a campaign meeting and I became aware there . were three long-standing party members watching me. ‘After . a while one of them said to me who was I, so I explained that I was a . friend of Ed's and I had come from London to help him campaign.

Gordon Brown’s refusal to be photographed with his own young children . and the former Prime Minister’s accusation that David Cameron used his . own family as ‘props’ in photographs. Asked by the BBC’s Andrew Marr why he had . decided to bring them into the public eye ‘with 500 cameras’ present, . he said: ‘I love having my family here.

Of the many dramatic storylines featured in Downton Abbey to keep Sunday night viewers hooked - the most prevalent has always been what will happen to the house and whether it will stay in the family. So perhaps it is somewhat fitting that the owner of Highclere Castle, the setting for the period drama, fears the estate could be broken up and sold - because of changing inheritance laws. In an interview with The Lady magazine, the 8th Earl of Carnarvon said changes in the law of royal succession, which now allow first-born daughters to accede to the throne ahead of their younger brothers, could put estates across the country in jeopardy. Fears: The Earl of Carnarvon fears his estate - the setting for Downton Abbey - is in danger of being sold because of changing inheritance laws . He said the change, which has prompted some to argue for an abolition of male primogeniture when it comes to aristocratic titles and estates, was a step towards the French Napoleonic Code - which decreed property should be split equally among offspring. The idea has never gained traction in this country, but some in certain circles fear it may only be a matter of time before it becomes law. The Earl of Carnarvon said: 'There's obviously a reason for these things, which was to keep the place intact with the same name attached to it. 'If you go further down that road, you are going to be heading towards the Napoleonic Code, which would break up all the great British places and that would be the end of them. It would mean selling them all, which probably wouldn't be the best idea.' The concern echoes one of season one's main plotlines - when the title and inheritance of Downton when to distance cousin Matthew Crawley. The Carnarvon family have come close . to losing their 50-bedroom, 6,000 acre estate before over the past 100 years – as Lady . Carnarvon reveals in her new biography, Lady Catherine And The Real . Downton Abbey. She said: 'After doing my research, I am amazed we are still here. 'The title dies or slips to a cousin then that's it - there's no point worrying about it.' Storyline: Inheritance was a main plot in the first series of the drama - the fourth series of which is due to return to our screens this weekend . Other families have been stung in the past by such laws - including the daughters of David Carnegie, the 14th Earl of Northesk, who failed to prevent the title from passing to someone he had never met. Patrick Carnegy, 72, claimed the title based on Carnegy's descent from a junior line of the family that split off in 1654. The latter case has been used by pressure groups who are trying to seek gender equality in line with changes to the royal succession. The Countess of Clancarty, a member of one group of more 100 noble families, told The Times: 'The Northesk case shows quite clearly how ridiculous, unfair and iniquitous the current system of inheritance is. The Countess did however accept that things had moved on from the world portrayed in Downton Abbey. She added: 'In today's world these houses are not personal assets anyway. This is not our personal asset. 'It is our personal passion and our home for the time being, but it's a shared treasure. 'We can only pass it on in as good a nick as possible ad then it is up to the next generation.'","The 8th Earl of Carnarvon owns Highclere Castle - the setting for Downton .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . PUBLISHED: . 19:38 EST, 19 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:48 EST, 20 September 2013 . Only 12 homes have been fitted with energy-saving measures under the Government’s flagship ‘Green Deal’, it emerged yesterday. The figure falls farcically short of the target ministers had set of 10,000 by the end of the year. The measures, which include double glazing, loft insulation and efficient boilers, are aimed at lowering bills and cutting the nation’s carbon emissions. The Green Deal, pictured being launched in 2011 by Nick Clegg and former Energy Secretary Chris Huhne, has only led to work being carried out 12 times . But property owners have proved reluctant to take out long-term loans to fund the work recommended by assessors. Even the knowledge that the loan repayments would be offset by lower bills has not convinced householders. One problem is that any loan would pass to the new owner of the property if it is sold – potentially putting off buyers. The scheme has also been brought into disrepute by hard-sell marketing firms who are cold-calling people at home, trying to arrange for Green Deal assessors to call. Two companies have been fined by the Information Commissioner’s Office for making nuisance calls associated with the scheme. There is also a question mark over the credentials of the army of hundreds of Green Deal assessors, who charge £100 to £300 to decide what energy-saving measures might be installed in a property. The policy was intended to encourage energy-saving measures at home, including double glazing, loft insulation and efficient boilers . The latest figures from the Department for Energy and Climate Change, which is running the policy, show 71,210 home assessments have been carried out since the scheme went live at the beginning of the year. Of these just 12 have led to the improvement work actually being carried out. Age UK, which has campaigned to protect elderly people who struggle to pay for heat and light, described the official figures as ‘hugely disappointing’. Caroline Abrahams, a director at  the charity, said: ‘With the cold weather nearly upon us, it is hugely disappointing that these latest statistics show painfully slow progress with the Green Deal. ‘With projections showing that fuel poverty rates are likely to rise, the Government must seriously explore using new carbon tax revenues to insulate fuel-poor homes against the spiralling cost of energy. ‘In the run-up to the next election all the main parties need to show they have a clear plan to deal with fuel poverty once and for all.’ The Government published research this week showing that people found the Green Deal assessments were useful. However, the reality is that only a tiny number have decided to get work done under the scheme. The survey reported that 78 per cent of people said their assessment was highly useful and 82 per cent of people expressed confidence in the recommendations made by their assessor. Ed Davey, Liberal Democrat energy and climate change secretary, said: ‘Green Deal assessments are proving to be extremely valuable and are leading to householders investing in energy saving measures. ‘Some people are using Green Deal finance; others are paying in different ways. And of course people should do whatever works best for them.’ Greg Barker, Tory energy and climate change minister, said: ‘The Green Deal is a long-term programme but the evidence is already showing that people are increasingly acting to improve their homes.’","Flagship policy was supposed to reach 10,000 homes .

When the best restaurants in the world battle it out for rave reviews, it's normally what's on the plate that counts. But a new list of the world's most stylish food establishments is judging fine dining not on the food, but on the furnishings. Architecture and interior website 'DesignCurial' has compiled a list of some of the most stunning environments in which to sit down to dinner, and the result is a real feast for the eyes. Sci-fi theme: The interior of TOY in New York is reminiscent of Ridley Scott's classic film Blade Runner . Mood lighting: Projectors inside the dining hall of the NYC restaurant can cast different lighting and images onto the walls meaning the room can change ambiance at the flick of a switch . The online compilation shows how much impetus leading chefs are placing on the ambiance of their restaurants, with some buildings in the list standing alone as architectural triumphs. The collection has brought together the simple and classic designs of Switzerland with the ultramodern invention of Japan. Spain and Thailand also have representatives in the run down of inspirational eating places. Eastern fusion: Kaiseki Yoshiyuki's Horse's Mouth, is a Japanese fine dining in a speakeasy style bar . Japanese flower: The interior of the Horse's Mouth feature tiled walls and cut-out windows displaying some 3000 origami flowers amid leather seating and dark wooden tables. Underground chic: The dining room of the Horse's Mouth, above, may look like a secret lair, but it's actually in the basement of a shopping centre . A compilation of such decadence and style would not, of course, be complete with out an entry from New York. The ultra chic restaurant TOY in the Big Apple is given credit for its sci-fi styled theme. The interior of the restaurant is lit with projectors which can rotate between images and hues. The bar and restaurant has strong style links with the Harrison Ford classic movie Blade Runner. Swiss cabin: The interior of Union, in Basel, Switzerland features a copper bar, copper light shades and even copper vases on the tables make this restaurant interior glow with sophistication . Classic twist: Union, above, also features lots of green, a design choice inspired by the Basel tradition of painting the front doors of houses green . It is often said that the appreciation of far eastern cuisine begins with the eyes, and that is certainly the case with the Horse's Mouth in Singapore. The exotic looking eatery is actually located beneath a huge shopping mall, but there is no sign of bland marble in the dramatically lit restaurant which is based on a speakeasy. One room has over 3,000 origami flowers as backdrop to sultry leather seating and dark wooden tables. Food with a view: Hoto Fudo, on Honshu Island, Japan sits in the shadow of the spectacular Mount Fuji . Function and form: Hoto Fudo's beautiful design, which leaves the restaurant open to the outside world, means the interior can be naturally air conditioned by the breeze . In the lead for outstanding exterior design is Hoto Fudo, which stands under the shadow of Mount Fuji, Japan. Designer Takeshi Hosaka left their white igloo open to the elements, to give the diners the feeling of being both outside and inside at the same time. In Paris, designer Odile Decq has created an undulating structure for 'Phantom L'opera' cleverly designed so it doesn't touch the walls of the Belle Epoque historic building. Instead the red floors, seating, furniture and fittings create a theatrical space weaving around at Mezzanine level within a glass wall isolating the restaurant from the building itself. Dramatic: Phantom L'opÈra, Paris, . is the ultra modern restaurant inside Palais Garnier opera house . Made to measure: The undulating roof of Phantom L'opÈra, Paris, above, is made so that it never touches the walls of the historic building behind . The list is completed by restaurants A Cantina in Santiago de Compostela, and Switzerland's Union, in Basel. The Swiss restaurant is a warming environment of copper surfaces and deep green wood which is influenced by the tradition of painting doors green in the local towns. A Cantina, with its minimalist structure is designed to bring the feeling of the outdoors in. Its simple wood structures are said to give diners the feeling of being at a Spanish summer food festival. Keeping it simple: A Cantina, in Santiago de Compostela, Spain has a minimalist design constructed from tree-like structures of blonde wood .

Planning: Nick Ross and his wife, Sarah Caplin, (pictured) will update their historic property making it into six storeys with five bedrooms . Former Crimewatch presenter Nick Ross has won planning permission to 'substantially demolish' his £17m Grade II listed home and replace it with a new six-storey, five-bedroom home. The 66-year-old television presenter was at the Westminster Council planning meeting himself last night to hear his extensive and controversial plans for the historic building described as being like Marmite - with people either loving it or hating it. But he was given permission to go ahead with his £10m building project on the elegant house between Notting Hill and Hyde Park in west London. Apart from a few tweaks in the . exterior design, the plans were agreed by Westminster . Council’s Planning Sub-Committee last night, with chairman Robert Davis praising the design. He said the design of the house was 'one of those things, you either like it or you don't like it, a bit like Marmite. 'I am afraid that I really like it.' The . new property, which will keep its Georgian facade, will boast a garage, . a two-storey basement, swimming pool, gym, projection room, staff . quarters and a wine cellar, and could be worth up to £40m once it is . finished. Proposals also include transforming . the exterior by adding a series of pergolas to the garden and a set of . balconies to the house itself, giving views over Orme Square in leafy . Bayswater. As it stands: this is what the Grade II listed Georgian Villa looks like at the moment . Planning officers had received 19 objections from local residents, and just four letters of support for the transformation of the property which Mr Ross and his wife Sarah Caplin paid £17m for last November. Last year it emerged that Nick Ross and . his wife Sarah Caplin had sold another luxury property for £35m - more than 40 times . what they paid for it 20 years ago. The . value of that house, which was bought by Saudi businessman Wafic Said, . had been significantly raised by extensive renovations. They bought the 1908 town house in Notting Hill, west London in 1993 for £950,000. They stold it to the financier Khaled Said and his wife Diane Elisabeth for about £35million. The TV presenter, who co-founded Childline, split the proceeds among his three grown-up sons and a charity. Christopher Wright, secretary of Bayswater Residents Association, had told planners: 'We do not consider that introducing a modern style of design needs to be out of keeping with the architectural style of the houses in the square, but the scale of the extension is very large and we feel will be obtrusive.' Mr Davis granted approval on the conditions that one of the proposed pergolas be removed, the roof be pulled back slightly to prevent overlooking into neighbours’ homes, and that the gates be made of railings. He said: 'It is also very important to bring this building back into use.' The proposal had been opposed by angry local residents who claimed Ross and his wife’s plans for the Georgian villa, which dates back to 1826, were 'out of character' with the area. Ross, who stepped down from presenting Crimewatch five years ago, was co-host for many years to Jill Dando, who was shot dead in 1999 . Speaking . after the meeting he said: 'I am sorry we have lost the pergola, it . doesn’t cause any problems with the adjoining premises. 'But yes, overall .

Criminal history: Israel Alverez, 33, was arrested for family violence on September 11 and now police believe he shot his family before killing himself . Police have revealed that a Texas mother was the one to kill herself, her husband and their three young children and not her abusive husband as initially suspected. On Tuesday the Navarro County Sheriff's office announced that it was Guadalupe Ronquillo-Ovalle who shot dead her husband Israel Alvarez and their children on Thursday in their home in Rice, a town about 40 miles south of Dallas. Investigators are still trying to determine why the 33-year-old mother fired the fatal shots. Alvarez and his sons had all been shot in the upper torso. Tanner said there was no indication that Alvarez fired any shots. He was arrested on a domestic assault charge less than two weeks before the family-of-five's bodies were found. Maria Franco, a family friend, said the couple came to her home on Sept. 16, asking for advice about keeping their relationship together. The couple talked about 'normal problems' they were having, she said. 'I didn't hear anything dangerous,' Franco said. Alvarez's father was the one to call police on Sunday night and report the slaying inside the family's home. In an audio recording released Tuesday of a 911 call made by Alvarez's father after he found the bodies, Manuel Alvarez said he thought the deaths were due to suicide from natural gas being left on in the home. He had to use a ladder to enter the home through a second-story balcony. Scene: Police found the bodies of Alverez, his wife and their three children with gunshot wounds to their torsos. Investigators also found a rifle in the house . Franco said the couple's 10-year-old . son was best friends with one of her sons. She had to tell her son that . his friend was now in heaven. 'I don't want to think about it,' Franco said. 'It breaks my heart.' Navarro County Sheriff Elmer Tanner said a rifle was found at the home. Investigators . were trying to determine when the shootings took place, Tanner said, . saying the children, ages 4, 8 and 12, were in school Thursday afternoon . but missed classes Friday. The police never suspected an outside individual, and always thought that it was an inside job. 'We have not seen anything yet that . makes us think we need to go outside this location,' Sheriff Tanner said . early into the investigation. Alvarez . was arrested September 11 on a misdemeanor family violence charge for . pushing Ronquillo-Ovalle and taking away her phone because he thought . she was talking to another man, she told deputies. According to a sheriff's office report released Monday, the woman went to her children's elementary school to call 911 because Alvarez took away her cell phone and removed the battery. Next step: Navarro County Sheriff Elmer Tanner said they are waiting to get the autopsies back to determine when the shootings took place. The children missed school on Friday and their grandfather discovered the bodies on Sunday . She told a deputy that she was on the phone talking to her sister when Alvarez entered the room and pushed her. Alvarez was charged with family violence assault, a misdemeanor. He pleaded no contest, paid a $367 fine and was released after spending two days in jail, records show. No . divorce filings or requests for a restraining order were filed, and . Ronquillo-Ovalle did not ask for a protective order, according to . records. When they got the . call on Sunday night, police immediately recognized the address of the . home because of the previous problems that had been reported. 'I don’t care where you are. Any time there’s five losses of lives in one location, that’s shocking and traumatic,' Sheriff Tanner said to the local NBC affiliate at the time. 'It doesn’t make any difference where you are.

Spitzer spent $10.3million on his failed bid to become New York City's next comptroller, while billionaire grocery store magnate John Catsimatidis spent $10.4million on his race to win the Republican primary vote for the city's mayoral race. The Wall Street Journal today cited the latest round of campaign disclosure statements that revealed how much the losses hurt the men’s respective wallets. Last minute bid: Disgraced former governor Eliot Spitzer made a late- and costly- entry to the city's race for comptroller that ended up costing him $10.3million . Spitzer's late entry to the comptroller race caused a stir, not only because it put his prostitution scandal back in the headlines five years after he resigned from office, but also because of the sheer amount of money that he was willing to spend. Apparently it wasn't enough as he ended up losing 48-52 to Scott Stringer, who spent about $6million. 'All along we knew it was going to be a close race,' Spitzer campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith told MailOnline at his party on the night of the primary. 'Yes people know Eliot and he has name recognition but Scott Stringer has the entire political establishment behind him- every union, every business.' The breakdown between how much he actually contributed to his campaign and how much of the $10.3m came from public donations was not publicly available, but it is safe to assume that a good portion came from his own bank account. Spitzer's net worth is not known, but the years since leaving the governor's mansion have been profitable ones for the Spitzers as Eliot and his wife Silda made a combined total of $4.27million in 2012 alone. Big spender: John Catsimatidis spent $10.4million on his failed bid to become the Republican nominee for the New York City mayoral race, and he has an estimated net worth of about $3.1billion . While Spitzer's family is very wealthy and his father Bernard is thought to have a net worth of around $500million, that is nothing compared to the Catsimatidis fortune. The 65-year-old Greek-American grocery tycoon was pegged by Forbes as being worth $3.1billion though that may be on the low end of the spectrum. Deep pockets: Billionaire Michael Bloomberg spent a whopping total of $265million on all three of his mayoral campaigns . His campaign to become the Republican mayoral candidate ended up costing $10.4million. The wasted money apparently doesn't bother Catsimitidis, even though his rival Joe Lhota ended up beating him by 12 points after having only spent $3.8million on his campaign. 'You know how much it bothers me that my opponent said that I was trying to buy the election? Zero. Cause when people met me, they loved me. And I loved them,' Mr Catsimatidis told The Wall Street Journal. In spite of the seven-figure sums that both Spitzer and Catsimatidis put up for their respective failures, both pale in comparison to the amounts that current mayor Michael Bloomberg spent on his three campaigns. When the self-made billionaire first ran for office in 2001, he spent $73million on the campaign and entered himself into the record books for being the costliest non-presidential campaign in U.S. history up until that point. He outdid himself in 2005 when he spent a further $84million to get re-elected and then a staggering $108million after the term limits restrictions were overturned, allowing him to hold on to the title of ‘Hizzoner’ until this November. The whopping total of $265million that Bloomberg spent on his races- not to mention additional millions covering transition costs and other expenses- is a drop in the bucket for him, however, as his net worth is estimated to be around $31billion. While he spent a fortune on the races, he didn’t cost the city very much himself as he took a salary of $1-per-year in office and opted to live in his own Upper East Side apartment so that Gracie Mansion, the building traditionally used to house the City’s mayor, could be rented out for events.","The disgraced former governor made a late entry to the comptroller's race that ended with him out $10.3million and shy four points of winning .

Miss Piggy is finally joining her love, Kermit the Frog, in the Smithsonian Institution's collection of legendary puppeteer Jim Henson's Muppets. Henson's family donated more than 20 puppets and props Tuesday to the National Museum of American History to accompany the earlier donations of Kermit, Oscar the Grouch and early Henson creations. The newest donation includes Miss Piggy and some of her co-stars from The Muppet Show, including Fozzie Bear, Rowlf the piano-playing dog, Scooter and the Swedish Chef. Puppets from Sesame Street joining the museum collection include Bert and Ernie, Elmo, Cookie Monster, Grover and Count Von Count, among others. Scroll down for video . Moi? Miss Piggy was welcomed into the Smithsonian's Museum of American History on Tuesday, finally joining her amphibian beau Kermit the Frog . Donation: The Miss Piggy puppet was gifted to the museum by Muppet creator Jim Henson's daughter Cheryl Henson (left) in a Tuesday ceremony . The food and frog loving Miss Piggy began as a minor character on the Jim Henson's The Muppet Show (1976). Miss Piggy's first television appearance was on a Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass Band special. As her story goes, Miss Piggy is a native Iowan, though she occasionally takes on a slight French accent. Miss Piggy's big break from background character to starring role came when a 'starlet character' was needed on an episode of The Muppet Show. Bonnie Erickson, who designed many of the famous Muppets and now serves as executive director of the Jim Henson Legacy explained to Smithsonian Magazine how Miss Piggy became star. 'We quickly ran to the eye drawer, got some very big eyes with long eyelashes and changed her wig,' he said, 'and I draped some fabric for a dress and put some pearls around her neck.' Many of the puppets are among the first constructions of the characters. Smithsonian . magazine welcomed Miss Piggy, dressed in a silver evening gown and . holding a red rose, with a photo shoot. The museum allowed her to pose . with Dorothy's ruby slippers from ‘The Wizard of Oz’ and to wear the . real 45-carat Hope Diamond from the National Museum of Natural History. ‘She . was very well-behaved, considering she wanted to take it home with . her,’ said Bonnie Erickson, who created the Miss Piggy puppet with . Henson and now is executive director of the Jim Henson Legacy . foundation. The gift was made on what would have been Henson's 77th birthday and shortly after his wife, Jane Henson, died in April. Since . she was diagnosed with cancer four years ago, Jane Henson spent years . planning to find permanent homes for each puppet character, Cheryl . Henson said. Other puppets will be donated to the Museum of the Moving . Image in Astoria, New York, and to the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta. ‘Many . of these puppets have been in boxes for years. They've been tucked away . in boxes, and we don't want them to stay in boxes. We want people to . see them and to appreciate them,’ Cheryl Henson said. ‘There's something . about puppets. They're not animated. ... They are actual, physical . things.’ Roommates: Sesame Street denizens Bert and Ernie will also join Miss Piggy at the Museum of American history . Cookie Monster and Grover were were also among the Muppets donated to the Smithsonian on Tuesday. 'They've been tucked away in boxes, and we don't want them to stay in boxes,' said Cheryl Henson .

The original Kermit and Cookie Monster will go on view in . November in a special display case, and a puppetry exhibit in early 2014 . will likely feature Bert and Ernie, among others, curators said. The Hensons have a longtime connection to Washington. Jim and Jane Henson met as students at the nearby University of Maryland and became performing partners before they married. They made early television commercials with their puppets and created a local TV show, ‘Sam and Friends,’ which included the first Kermit creation. The original Kermit, made from an old coat and pingpong balls for eyes, was donated to the Smithsonian in 2010, along with other characters from ‘Sam and Friends.’ Priceless: Along with Miss Piggy are Muppets Fozzie Bear, Scooter (2nd L), Rowlf (on piano) and Swedish Chef (right). The puppets are among 20 newly donated Jim Henson objects . Forgotten relatives: The Muppet named Wilkins was created by Henson in 1957 for the Wilkins Coffee commercials. He now appears his more famous Muppet cousins at the Museum of American History . The newest donation includes Boober Fraggle, Red Fraggle and Travelling Matt from the 1980s show ‘Fraggle Rock.’ The Hensons also donated a 1957 puppet called Wilkins that was made for Wilkins Coffee commercials. Erickson and others who worked with Henson gathered Tuesday at the museum for a donation ceremony and said the Muppets will have a new life among the relics of history. The puppets were never meant to be made for posterity, Erickson said, but ‘considering that they're retired, they're looking absolutely wonderful.’ Fran Brill, the first woman puppeteer Henson hired for ‘Sesame Street,’ who created the characters of Zoe and Prairie Dawn, said Henson had created a puppet family with his many collaborators. ‘I'm just looking at all of these characters and thinking this is the puppet family, and yet, I feel like they're all my relatives,’ she said. Curator Dwight Blocker Bowers said the puppets represent the creativity of ‘one of America's great innovators.’ He said Henson had extended the boundaries of puppetry, using film and television. ‘I love these puppets' eyes. You can't walk near them without making eye contact,’ Blocker Bowers said. ‘They're very much like an oil painting. And they have such an innocence.’ Big leagues: The famously histrionic Miss Piggy will appear as part of the permanent American Stories exhibit starting in March alongside such famous showbiz relics as Dorthy's ruby slippers from the Wizard of Oz .

In court: Amanda Hutton denies the manslaughter of her four-year-old son Hamzah Khan . The mummified body of a four-year-old boy was found in his mother’s bedroom after a police community support officer (PCSO) noticed the 'vile smell of filth' coming from the house, a court has been told. Hamzah Khan's mummified body was discovered in a cot in his mother Amanda Hutton's Bradford home in September 2011. The little boy died on 14 December 2009. PCSO Jodie Dunsmore told a jury today she knew 'something was definitely not right' at Hutton’s house when he visited in September 2011. Mrs Dunsmore, now a police officer, said she was only on her second day as a full PCSO when she began investigating a neighbour’s complaint about the house. The officer told the jury at Bradford Crown Court how she continually returned to the house over a number of days but got no reply. Pc Dunsmore said she became even more suspicious when she noticed large quantities of flies on the window ledge and a terrible smell coming through the letter box. She said that after at least five visits, she and a colleague threatened to kick in the door, despite having no such legal power to as PCSOs. The officer said that at that point Hutton opened the door and looked 'deadful'. She said: 'Her hair was all matted and she was looking very unkempt. She had a woollen jumper on and it appeared flies were coming off her jumper.' 'She looked like she was going to throw up. She had a look of fear on her face.” The officer said Hutton would not let her in. She continued: 'There was a vile smell of filth radiating from the door. I’d not even got to the end of the path before I’d rung social services. Something was definitely not right.' The jury was then told how Hamzah Khan was found in a cot in Amanda Hutton’s bedroom later that day when police officers arrived. He had been dead for almost two years. Prosecutors told the court that Hamzah died because he was starved to death . The court has heard Hamzah Khan's mummified body was discovered in a cot in Hutton's Bradford home in September 2011 . Hutton, who told police he died of natural causes, denies manslaughter. A retired police domestic violence . officer who had frequent contact with Hutton because she claims she was . abused by her long-term partner - Hamzah’s father, Aftab Khan - also . spoke in court today. Virginia Whittaker said . Hutton received the highest level response from the . multi-agency domestic violence team, including attempts to rehouse her. But . Ms Whittaker said Hutton was reluctant to engage with health visitors because 'she lost faith in the health service . after her mum died'. The former officer said her unit helped with fitting panic alarms and anti-arson letterboxes to Hutton’s house. Maria . Hodgson - a friend of Hutton’s family who knew her for more than 20 . years - said the defendant changed after her mother died at the end of . 2005. Mrs Hodgson was asked about a phone call lasting more than 30 minutes between her and Hutton on December 14 2009. Paul . Greaney QC, prosecuting, asked Mrs Hodgson whether the defendant . mentioned anything about Hamzah being ill during that conversation. Mrs Hodgson said she did not. Aftab Khan, pictured, told Bradford Crown Court how he confronted Hutton about how she was looking after Hamzah Khan . Hutton's neighbour said the woman was often drunk and tearful. Christine Latz said she lived next door to Amanda Hutton and got to know her after she moved into her street in Bradford, in March 2009. She said the defendant talked to her about the abusive relationship she had moved away from. Asked . whether there was any 'common feature' she noticed about Hutton, Mrs . Latz said: 'She just smelt of alcohol. She appeared to be drunk quite . often, tearful. 'She told me she’d come out of an abusive relationship to make a fresh start down here.' Hamzah Khan's father Aftab Khan was also in court today. He told the court how he confronted Hutton about how she was looking after his son. But he said she told him to mind his own business and banned him from the house less than a year before the little boy died. Mr Khan told the court how he had separated from Hutton after he was charged with assaulting her. He said he was initially stopped from visiting Hutton due to a court order, but did start to go and see his son when they moved. Mr Khan told the jury his former partner was not looking after Hamzah properly. 'I said ""look at the state of him - you're not looking after him"" and she told me to get out,' he told the jury. The mechanic and taxi driver told the court that it was his concerns about his son that had led to the arguments resulting in his arrest in 2008 and eventual conviction for battery. He said: 'She wasn't bathing him. She wasn't changing him.' Mr Khan said he would only see Hutton feeding Hamzah milk. He said his former partner drank cider and vodka heavily, especially after the death of her mother. 'She'd be absolutely out of it,' he said. Hutton today sat in the dock dressed in black, watching Mr Khan give his evidence. Mr Khan told the jury he contacted social services once about the condition of Hamzah but said he was ignored. A senior police officer told the court there was no record he ever made the call. Yesterday, Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, asked Khan whether he did contact social services. He said: 'I remember ringing social services up. They said it was a private matter. Claims: The jury heard how Khan, left, was charged with assaulting Hutton, right, in 2008 . Pressed by Mr Greaney, he said: 'I clearly remember. There's no record of it. They weren't bothered, they weren't interested. I'd given up at that time.' Mr Greaney QC also asked Mr Khan about urging police to 'go and check' on Hamzah. 'Yes, so they could see the neglect for themselves,' he answered. Mr Greaney asked Mr Khan about a text message he sent to Hutton which read: . 'Don't worry it's not me who's going to land you in the s***, you're . going to do that yourself. You've turned into the biggest liar, stop . drinking.' The text also asked what Hamzah had 'had' and added: 'Think about what you're doing to everybody.' Mr Greaney asked him: 'What do you mean by ""had""?' Mr Khan answered: 'I meant what food, had he been fed properly?' Mr Khan rejected claims in court that he was a 'wife batterer'. Stephen Meadowcroft QC, defending, asked him: 'You were a wife batterer and she was a battered wife, cowed by your violence.' Mr Khan said: 'If I was a wife batterer why am I not standing next to her (Hutton)?' Mr Meadowcroft replied: 'Perhaps you ought to be.' The . defence barrister put it to Mr Khan that he had been violent towards . his client throughout their 20-year relationship, but he denied this. 'I've come here to answer questions about my child,' he said. On going: The case continues at Bradford Crown Court, pictured . 'Everyone knows what happened. You've got damning evidence against Miss Hutton but you're still trying to point the finger at me. I'm not having it.' Mr Meadowcroft told him: 'You were the father of the family. You were there. Had you actually thought that (Hamzah's neglect)? What did you do about it?' Mr Khan told the court: 'The police wouldn't believe me. No one would believe me. 'I know I made one phone call. If the police weren't going to believe me, who else is going to believe me? I gave up. 'The system failed my son. Did the school check up? Did social services check up? I lost my total confidence in the system.' Mr Khan said he helped Hutton before the court case, giving her money to buy clothes for the trial. 'I've helped her a lot. If I was a violent man, I wouldn't have helped.' Pc Maria Furness, of West Yorkshire Police, told the jury she attended Hutton's house to perform a welfare check but found Hamzah to be 'fed well, clean, healthy looking and there was an appropriate adult in the address'. Pc Furness said she was at the house for about 30 to 45 minutes when she made the visit about eight months before Hamzah's death. The case continues.

Encouraged by TV chefs such as Nigella Lawson and Gordon Ramsay, Britons are eating more halloumi than any other nation besides the Cypriots who make it. Some 3,030 tonnes of the cheese were imported into the UK last year. This was more than the next top European importers – Sweden, at 1,280 tonnes, Germany (870) and Austria (510) – put together. Craze: Brits are scrambling for the cheese, made of goats or ewes milk, instead of the usual cheddar . Tesco’s sales of its own-brand halloumi are up by 132 per cent. More is also being sold at restaurants, with Nando’s recording a rise of 138 per cent since 2010. Halloumi is made from a mixture of goat’s and sheep’s milk and its high melting point means it can be fried, grilled or barbecued. It is also packaged in brine, which means it can be stored unopened in the fridge for up to a year whilst giving it a unique salty taste. Greek cheese is flying off the shelves in UK supermarkets. 3,030 tonnes of halloumi were imported last year . Popular: The cheese is so popular, Cypriots want to impose regulations to stop makers wrongly using cows milk . Cheese specialist Neil Burchell said: ‘It’s easy to see why halloumi has done so well – it’s delicious fried, grilled or barbecued.’ To accomodate for the rise, Tesco has doubled their range of Greek cheese. They now stock and sell six different varieties and sales of feta cheese are also soaring in the UK. Tesco cheese buyer Ashleigh MacFarlane said: 'We started selling one type of feta and one type of halloumi about 10 years ago in our larger stores. 'The majority of sales would come during the summer months as they were then mainly bought to go in salads. The high melting point of the Greek cheese makes it perfect for grilling, frying and barbecuing . Fried cheese, or saganaki, with shrimps is a traditional Greek dish that is making its way across Europe . 'But demand has really been boosted by celebrity chefs such as Nigella Lawson, Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsay who have featured these cheeses on their TV shows and in their recipe books. 'These programmes have helped demonstrate the versatility of these cheeses which are now often used in cooking to make pizzas, pies and lasagne as well as making great toppings for pasta dishes.' With rising demand, Cyprus is seeking ‘protected designation of origin’ status for halloumi in Europe. This would lay down criteria a cheese would have to meet to be labelled halloumi. However the process has so far failed, resulting in big clashes as to how to make the cheese. Traditional Halloumi is made from a mixture of goat’s and sheep’s milk, but with no PDO to regulate its creation many varieties can also contain cow’s milk.","Tesco has doubled Greek cheese stock as halloumi sales are up 132 per cent .

Tragic: Gloria Knowles, who was savaged to death by her daughter's dogs, pictured at Harrington's pie and mash shop, Tooting, where she worked . A pack of four family dogs which mauled a pensioner to death had savaged her grandchildren and attacked other animals before the fatal attack, an inquest heard today. Gloria Knowles, 71, was set upon by two ‘giant’ Bordeaux French mastiffs, which weighed between seven and nine-and-a-half stones (40-60 kilograms), and two American bulldog-type dogs as she went to feed them in her daughter’s garden on October 30 last year. She was so badly injured one of her arms was almost severed in the attack. A fifth dog, who the family were looking after for a friend, may also have been involved in the attack. Mrs Knowles’ daughter Beverley said one of the bulldogs, a male Alapaha blue blood, had attacked two other dogs in the months before her mum was savaged and she had wanted it put down. She said: 'He had a fight with one of my friend’s dogs in the park and then he attacked our female bulldog as well. 'I didn’t trust him very much if I’m honest. After he attacked the other two dogs it really scared me and I wanted him put down.' The mother-of-three, of Morden, Surrey, added: 'There was another incident in about May last year where the same dog killed our family cat.' Beverley’s ex Dylan Mason said there were also two incidents involving the former couple’s sons last summer. He . said: 'My older son, who was 16 at the time, was chased by the four . dogs in the park. They just kept jumping up at him and trying to grab . him. Brutal: The court heard how all of the dogs, including two French Mastiffs, two American bulldogs and a small mongrel (all pictured), have been put down after all their bite marks were found on Mrs Knowles' body . 'And a couple of months later they attacked my 10-year-old son and he had quite severe bite marks on his arm.' It also emerged the dogs had also savaged Mrs Knowles the previous summer. But instead of putting it down the . family, who had six dogs at that time, got rid of two other dogs, . leaving them with four in their home in Morden, Surrey. Recording a narrative verdict, . Westminster Coroner Fiona Wilcox, said: 'It would appear that all four . dogs had a history of behaving in ways that were inappropriate. 'In . the summer before this incident both of the French Mastiffs were . involved in chasing and running down Beverley’s eldest son and her . youngest, who was 10 at the time, received severe bites to his arm. 'The Alapaha bulldog had also attacked another dog in the park and then attacked one of her other dogs within two weeks. Dog attack: Mrs Knowles (centre) with daughters Jasmine-Jade Knowles (left), and Beverley Knowles (right) Daughter Beverley Knowles, left, said she was scared of one of her dogs after it attacked another in a park. The inquest heard how Gloria Knowles, right, was apparently afraid of the dogs she was going to feed . 'This disturbed her to the point she wanted the dog put down.' Ms Wilcox said Mrs Knowles apparently didn't trust the Alapaha as it had previously jumped up and bit her hand. She . said the series of attacks suggested that all the dogs were 'out of . control' having all shown evidence of 'behaving aggressively before this . incident'. 'I think it is . very, very sad the dogs that chased Beverley’s son and had bitten Mrs . Knowles before unfortunately acted in the way that they did the day of . the attack and took Mrs Knowles' life.' Beverley’s . ex-husband Dylan Mason told the coroner he didn’t have the dogs put . down because he 'believed they needed some more time spent on training . them'. On . the day of the attack widow Mrs Knowles, who had lived next door to her . daughter since her husband Victor died of cancer in 2007, was looking . after her grandchildren. At around 5pm she went next door to feed her daughter’s dogs. Neighbours reported hearing shrieks but thought it was the kids playing. Scene: The back garden of Gloria Knowles' daughter Beverley where it is believed the five dogs attacked her . Mr Mason returned from work to his home in Rutland Drive an hour later and discovered the body. He said: 'The mongrel was really excited to see me when I came in. The other four dogs were behind the stair gate in the conservatory. 'I noticed a pile of clothes in the garden. I thought the dogs had pulled the washing off the line then I saw it was Mrs Knowles. It was only then I saw blood around the dogs mouths and two of the dogs were covered in blood.' Mrs Knowles was pronounced dead at 6.24pm. A post mortem found she died of shock and blood loss. Pathologist Dr Ashley Fegan-Earl said she received multiple bite wounds, most of them to her arms, head and neck. Detective Sergeant Danny Taylor said he believed all of the dogs were involved in the attack. He . said: 'There is evidence from a surgeon who examined Mrs Knowles body . that given the measurements of the dental casts taken from the dogs that . all the dogs had at some stage bitten her.' Animals removed: Police have seized the two French Mastiffs, the American bulldogs and the mongrel and are in police-approved kennels pending the post-mortem . Tragedy: Dog baskets and food bowls can be seen in the garden at the scene where Gloria Knowles may have been mauled to death by the animals . The dogs have since been destroyed after police ruled they were a danger to the public. Mrs Knowles, who was described as a ‘very placid person who was always on the go doing housework or gardening’ had helped run a family pie shop in Tooting, south London, for several generations. Beverley wiped away a tear as the coroner spoke of her mother as a ‘popular and well known figure in the area where she lived and worked for many years.’ Two years ago Barbara Williams, 52, was mauled to death by an eight stone Neapolitan mastiff in Wallington, south London. The dog had been kept in a cage seven inches shorter than its body. Earlier this year its owner Alex Blackburn-Smith, 35, admitted failing to ensure the dog's welfare and was ordered to do 150 hours' unpaid work and pay costs of £3,300 at Croydon Magistrates' Court. In January Leslie Trotman, 83, died after he was mauled by a 'pitbull-type' dog that had broken out of his neighbour's garden in Brentford, West London.","Gloria Knowles, 71, went next door to feed animals but was mauled to death .

The service, which will be trialled before Christmas, will allow eBay users to ‘click and collect’ from more than 150 Argos shops across Britain. The auction site hopes this will solve the problem of its customers waiting at home for parcels or having to pick them up after missing the postman. New deal: eBay users will be able to 'click and collect' from 150 Argos stores in the run up to Christmas . Amazon, eBay’s biggest online rival, already has deals with newsagents across the UK, letting shoppers pick up packages in their own time. Currently more than 18million people in Britain use eBay. Although it began as an auction site for private sellers, more than 100 household names – from the Superdry clothing brand to House of Fraser – now use it to sell their wares. Initially only the top 50 eBay sellers, all large brands, will be able to offer the ‘click and collect’ service, for which there will be no extra charge. If the six-month trial is successful, it could be expanded to all of Argos’s 735 UK stores. The service will eventually  also become available to the millions of ordinary eBay users who auction off everything from second-hand clothes and unwanted gadgets to spare concert tickets. Buying online and collecting  in store has become the fastest growing aspect of the high street, with Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Asda all already offering  the service. More than 40 per cent of British shoppers . used some form of click and collect last Christmas, according to . figures from research group Econsultancy.

Devin Wenig, president of eBay, said: ‘The distinction between offline and online shopping continues to blur. This exciting pilot takes us one step nearer to our goal of offering a seamless shopping experience.’ Argos began its own collection service in 2000 which now accounts for a third of its business. The company is expecting to also benefit from the deal with eBay because it will increase the number of shoppers coming through its doors. Dr Scott Dacko of Warwick Business School said: ‘It is likely to be a win-win-win arrangement. ‘I am sure it will prompt a host of competitors to look into similar partnerships. Integration in online and off-line sales is the future for retail.’ But Maureen Hinton, of research group Verdict, warned that Argos risked setting itself  up as a ‘warehouse for its rivals’ if it rolled out the scheme too quickly.","More than 150 Argos shops will trial the service .

The grandfather of eight, who lives with his wife Pam in Llangefni, Anglesey, North Wales, said: 'I’ve . no regrets. I helped start the biggest rock band in the world and it . enabled me to hang out with the likes of Jimi Hendrix - that’s enough . for me.' By the time Mr Dennis had returned to the UK from Bahrain, . Pink Floyd’s first album Piper At The Gates Of Dawn had been released. He said: 'When I first picked up . Floyd’s first record in a store, I felt nothing but proud of them. I was . so pleased and happy that they had made it.' He added: 'To be honest, I didn’t . even like the sort of music Pink Floyd were playing at the time - so . they probably wouldn’t have had the success they’ve had if I had . continued to play in the band. 'I’m not bitter or jealous . at all of the success of the other guys - that doesn’t even come into . it. The band was a bit of fun back then and I was a bit of a joker. 'My only regret was I only wish I’d . taken more photographs of the guys then. I was never really a fan of . their music, but the stuff they do now is just wonderful.'

A year later he recorded with the band alongside Roger Waters, Richard Wright, drummer Nick Mason and Barrett. He said: 'I was in a music shop in . Soho looking for a guitar and I saw Bob and he introduced me to Roger . Waters. 'They explained they were looking for a singer for their band . and said: ""We’ll put you in"". Of course I said yes. 'I had been in bands since I was a . 16-year-old lad, playing in various skiffle bands and I knew Bob from . the gig circuits in Cambridge when I was posted there. He used to come . round and jam with my band.' Mr Dennis rehearsed regularly with the band before becoming the frontman for their first set of gigs. He said: 'We would rehearse in the . house they shared. We at that time we didn’t even have a name - and . believe me, it was a dispute. 'We were rehearsing blues songs for . our first gig at a private party in Surrey. It was mostly covers we did . back then, we’d practice at the house two or three times a week. 'On the night of the gig, Syd ran . through and said, ""I’ve got a name, it’s going to be called Pink Floyd."" Well, I didn’t like it at the time because it didn’t make sense.' He left a year later when he was . posted to Bahrain but said he was going to leave anyway because he did . not like Pink Floyd's music.

No regrets: Mr Dennis, pictured with one of his guitars, set up his own studio after quitting Pink Floyd . 'He liked the traditional blues music . like Muddy Waters, where I was more into the more up-beat blues you . could dance too - like the Stones and Chuck Berry. 'He wouldn’t like if we didn’t play it exactly right - I was getting a bit fed up and I didn’t think it was going anywhere. 'I was planning on leaving anyway because . I wasn’t into the music they were playing - I wanted to play blues music. 'And when I came back they never asked . me back in the band. They had a completely different sound anyway, they . had changed their style. 'I’d finished with it. The band was a six month . blip in my life. It was good but I had moved on from it.' Mr Dennis pursued a career in music after leaving the RAF in 1973. He set up his own studio in Cambridge and laid down tracks for the likes of Dave Berry, The Glitter Band's Tony Leonard and members of Shakin Stevens. He has also built up a collection of 20 guitars - three of which he recently put up for auction. The Sunburst Stratocaster and Fender Squire Stagemaster sold for almost £500 but a Gretch Eddie Cochrane worth £600 failed to sell. Mr Dennis has continued to play but admits he is more likely to play to a group of friend's at a party than thousands of people in an arena. He said: 'I speak to Nick two or three times a year . and maybe Roger once a year - but I have to say they do move in . different circles to me now.'

Elizabeth Cowhig, 22, has won nearly £13,000 in damages after being sexually harassed at Digital Maintenance Ltd by sales manager Owen Kennard . A young woman had her bottom slapped in the office by her boss, who told her: ‘Sorry I couldn’t resist,’ an employment tribunal heard. Married Owen Kennard, 41, told 22-year-old Elizabeth Cowhig she had ‘the best legs’ of all his staff and repeatedly made inappropriate remarks about her being ‘fit’ and ‘sexy’. He pestered her over the course of five months, but after it became clear that she was never going to give in to his advances he sacked her without any warning. Yesterday Miss Cowhig, from Aughton in Lancashire, spoke of her relief after being awarded £13,000 in compensation for sexual harassment. She said: ‘I was treated in a disgusting and despicable manner. I felt embarrassed and humiliated by Mr Kennard’s behaviour and comments but was afraid of losing my job if I complained. ‘I kept telling him I wasn’t interested – he was old enough to be my father – but he refused to take no for an answer.’ She added: ‘It was never about the money, but about making sure that he couldn’t get away with treating other women the same way. Now I’m just relieved it is all over.’ Miss Cowhig’s ordeal began in August 2011 only a few weeks after she started working in a call centre for Digital Maintenance Ltd – an electronic sales firm in Liverpool. After a few weeks Mr Kennard started ‘lingering’ at her desk, rubbing her shoulders and even kissed her forehead. On one occasion he asked her to spend the night with him in the luxury Malmaison hotel. He also told her: ‘You’ve got the best legs in DML.’ In December 2011 he slapped her on the bottom, saying: ‘Sorry, I couldn’t resist that.’ Owen Kennard , 41, told Miss Cowhig she had 'the best legs' of all his staff and repeatedly made inappropriate remarks, a court heard . Miss Cowhig, who said the case had left her depressed and anxious said: ‘I was shocked and angry. He did it in full view of my colleagues, which was humiliating. ‘It was totally inappropriate and left me feeling violated.' The sales assistant also claimed she attempted to phone the firm’s managing director to complain, but was reprimanded by Mr Kennard for trying to make the call. 'Violated': Elizabeth Cowhig's legal advisor said they hoped the case would inspire other women who suffer sexual harassment to come forward . In January 2012, Mr Kennard called her into his office and sacked her without giving her any warning. During the tribunal the father of two denied all the allegations, claiming her poor performance was behind his decision to let her go. But an employment panel rejected his claims and found in Miss Cowhig’s favour. In . a written judgement, they concluded: ‘Mr Kennard took the decision to . dismiss the claimant because she had refused to accede to his sexual . attention. ‘The suggestions that were made by Mr Kennard were sufficiently serious to constitute sexual harassment.’ Miss . Cowhig’s legal advisor Michael McDonough said: ‘We are very pleased to . have been able to obtain some justice for Elizabeth’s appalling and . distressing treatment. ‘We . hope that this case is going to provide some inspiration to other women . who are suffering sexual harassment to take action and not to tolerate . this behaviour.’","Elizabeth Cowhig, 21, claims Owen Kennard harassed her over five months .

Prediction: Some rain and cloud is expected to arrive by tomorrow, although it is believed it will turn sunny again by Friday . Temperatures tomorrow should remain similar to today, while Friday is looking like it could be sunny again across the country, apart from the south west. The weekend however could be unsettled with the possibility of some heavy showers. Ms Mears said: 'It's just above average for this time of year really, so it does feel warmer than it should be.

Dr Drew Pinsky, host of Dr Drew On Call, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2011 and has written about his experience . Putting off going to the doctor to avoid a prostate exam is an experience known to many middle-aged men. You might have though that middle-aged doctors might be better at getting themselves a check-up, but as the testimony of one man shows, that's not always the case. Dr Drew Pinsky, host of HLN show Dr Drew On Call, has revealed in a post on the TV network's website that he had his prostate removed after suffering from cancer for two years. He is speaking out for the first time in a bid to raise awareness of the disease which will affect more than half of all men who live until they're 80. In the heartfelt piece, he writes: 'I want you to hear it from me. Not from the Internet. Not from a gossip column. Not from someone who doesn’t know me. 'And I want to make you aware. Men, you are likely to get prostate cancer. The odds are you will if you live long enough. When you do, don’t freak out. You don’t need to take action today. In many cases, time is on your side.' In the confessional article he explains how, despite being a doctor himself, it was actually his wife that convinced him to get tested. Once the signs of cancer were detected, Pinsky's doctor decided to order a biopsy despite the TV star insisting that nothing was wrong. Speaking about the biopsy, he says: 'It was awful. They don’t put you under. They take a prostate tissue sample through the anus. Dr Drew has revealed he was back at work 10 days after his operation, is now back to working out, is eating well and feels good . 'What they discovered was a low-grade tumor. What I discovered is that my own intuition and judgment were telling me that I had nothing to fear. But I had prostate cancer, for sure.' According . to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 200,000 men in the US . will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year, and 25,000 will die . from it. It . is most common in men over 65, and by the time men reach 80 there is . more than a 50 per cent chance they will have developed it. It has very few outward signs and can often remain undetected for years before sufferers develop symptoms. However . research has found that, if carefully monitored, only a third of cases will . get worse. One third will remain unchanged, and one third will get . better. Risks . associated with surgery include loss of sensation in the penis, . incontinence and infertility, meaning men are reluctant to get tested in . case they need the procedure. Together he and his physician decided to watch and wait, knowing that there was only a 30 per cent chance of the tumour getting worse. But after a year of observation and two more biopsies there was evidence that the tumour had grown and become unpredictable. The decision was made to remove it. The surgery involved a four-armed robot, operated by a surgeon, making its way into his pelvis via four incisions to remove the kiwi-sized gland. However, when it was taken out, and despite the pain of recovery, Pinsky was glad he had opted for surgery. The tumour had grown a 'finger', meaning it was about to spread to other areas of his body had it not been removed. It took him 10 days to return to work following the operation, though he says that in hindsight his jobs - presenting his HLN show alongside the Dr Drew Podcast - could have waited longer. He recommends that other men get screened for the disease, though he admits the PSA test is complicated and controversial, and says not to avoid a biopsy just because it affects a sensitive area of the body. He also thanks his wife, Susan, for making him go to the doctor. Dr Drew is a practicing physician, Board Certified in Internal Medicine, Board Certified in Addiction Medicine and a member of the staff at Huntington Memorial Hospital. Pinsky is also Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the Keck USC School of Medicine.","Despite being a practicing physician he was reluctant to get tested .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . PUBLISHED: . 03:59 EST, 24 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:25 EST, 24 September 2013 . Troubled smartphone maker BlackBerry has agreed a deal that will see it sold to a consortium led by its largest shareholder for $4.7 billion (£2.85 billion). The Canadian firm said it had signed a letter of intent agreement with Fairfax Financial over a $9 per share cash deal. It comes days after BlackBerry, one of the pioneers of the smartphone industry, revealed it expected to make a loss of a billion dollars (£606 million) after disastrous sales of its new handsets, and would lay off 4,500 staff. Blackberry President and CEO Thorsten Heins, pictured, attempted to boost the Canadian firm's poor sales over the past year through a series of releases, including the Q10, pictured. But it wasn't enough and the company has now agreed a deal with its largest shareholder, Fairfax Financial, to be bought for $4.7 billion . Ailing phone group BlackBerry bought a private jet worth over $20 million just months before it laid off 4,500 workers and  reported a nearly $1 billion second-quarter loss, it was revealed on Sunday. Ill-timed . executives had the second-hand Bombardier Global Express delivered in . July and explained the decision as a cost-cutting exercise as the plane . replaced two older aircraft. The company later announced it will now sell the latest addition to their fleet and will no . longer own any private jets. Blackberry . said last week it will lay off thousands of employees, or 40 per . cent of its global workforce, as it reported a nearly $1 billion . second-quarter loss. Canadian billionaire investor Prem Watsa, Fairfax's chairman and chief executive, said: 'We believe this transaction will open an exciting new private chapter for BlackBerry, its customers, carriers and employees. 'We can deliver immediate value to shareholders, while we continue the execution of a long-term strategy in a private company with a focus on delivering superior and secure enterprise solutions to BlackBerry customers around the world.' Sales of shares in the Nasdaq-listed company, which plunged after Friday's announcement, were halted after the news of the deal which would take it private. BlackBerry began trading in 1999 as an arm of Candian firm Research in Motion. The company changed its name to BlackBerry earlier this year. It carried out a high profile launch of two new handsets at the start of the year - the much delayed Z10 touchscreen and Q10 with a qwerty keyboard. A new phone, the touchscreen Z30, was unveiled last week. BlackBerry announced its new Z30 handset, pictured, last week before announcing losses of a billion dollars and laying off 4,500 - or 40 per cent - of its workforce. The Canadian firm said it had signed a letter of intent agreement with Fairfax Financial over a $9 per share cash deal . Since 2007, BlackBerry has lost 93 per cent of its market share, with half going in the past year alone . They were designed to see it catch up with Apple, Samsung and other smartphone makers after falling behind in terms of new technology after the launch of the iPhone in 2007. But the new handsets failed to win over critics and sales were far below what the firm was hoping for. Its market share in the first quarter of this year was 2.9 per cent, according to analysts, down from 41 per cent in 2007. BlackBerry said it had set up a special committee in August to look at the financial alternatives for the company in the face of its poor trading figures. The agreement with Fairfax allows it to 'go shop' for alternative offers for the firm should they become available during the due diligence process, which is expected to take until 4 November. Chairwoman Barbara Stymiest said: 'The special committee is seeking the best available outcome for the Company's constituents, including for shareholders. 'Importantly, the go-shop process provides an opportunity to determine if there are alternatives superior to the present proposal from the Fairfax consortium.' More bad luck plagued the firm earlier this week after it announced it would be making its BlackBerry Messenger service available on Android and iOS devices. However, an unofficial app was leaked which led BlackBerry to postpone the release.

The discovery of a meth lab near your home can have a devastating effect on property prices with a 10.5 percent decline in sale prices for homes sold within an eighth of a mile of a lab, according to recent research. The Department of Economics at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, also found that the negative impact of 'The Breaking Bad effect' can last at least two years after a lab is busted by the cops. Consider the plight of the neighbors of drug kingpin Walter White in the hit TV show. 'The Breaking Bad effect': Living near a busted meth lab can cause serious harm to the price of your property . In last week’s episode of the series which ends this Sunday, the White family home was put up for sale by police auction. Although the home was never used as a meth lab in the series, on the open market it would be viewed as guilty by association and White’s neighbors could expect to see their house prices plummet as a consequence. Exterior shots on the show are filmed in the Loma Del Rey neighborhood of Albuquerque. Based on the median home price of $265,000 for that area, homes on the same block as the White residence could expect to drop to $237,175 as a result of his drugs bust, reports Business Insider. Holy Cross econ professor Joshua Congdon-Hohman first calculated how much damage meth labs cause to surrounding home values in his 2011 paper: 'The Lasting . Effects of Crime: The Relationship of Discovered Methamphetamine . Laboratories and Home Values.' The discovery of a meth lab in an area can have a very damaging impact on house prices within up to a quarter of a mile of the lab . Using housing sales data from Akron, Ohio, which has that state's largest concentration of meth labs, he found:•    A 10.5 percent decline in sales prices for homes sold within an eighth of a mile after a lab is discovered. •    The decline can be as much as 19 percent within the first year after a lab is discovered.•    There is a 4.5 percent decline for homes sold within a quarter of a mile.•    The decline persists for at least two years afterwards.•    Just a single busted meth lab site can be enough to take down several blocks in a neighborhood.

He said: 'And as soon as he got to the bar door, it made a left and walked in like he wanted to have a beer.

He has compiled an impressive photo album showing himself posing alongside more than 200 graves across six continents. Scroll down for video . Historic: Nurse Mark Dabbs pictured in London's Highgate Cemetery at the grave of Karl Marx, one of more than 200 prominent figures whose final resting places he has visited . Significant: The grave of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, whose assassination sparked the First World War, in Austria . Power: Mr Dabbs next to the grave of U.S. president Grover Cleveland in New Jersey . Mr Dabbs, from Walsall in the West Midlands, has visited the tombs of men as influential as U.S. president Grover Cleveland, in New Jersey, and Archduke Franz Ferdinand, in Austria. The 48-year-old also travelled to Switzerland, where Charlie Chaplin is buried, and to Napoleon Bonaparte's tomb in Paris. To hunt down stars from the showbiz past he has been to the U.S., to see Bruce Lee in Seattle, Dean Martin in Las Vegas and Johnny Ramone in Los Angeles. Mr Dabbs has a special interest in the pioneer outlaws of the Wild West, as shown by his visits to the graves of Buffalo Bill in North Dakota and Calamity Jane in Arizona.

Outlaw: Buffalo Bill, whose towering statue is in North Dakota, is another leading figure for the Wild West . Closer to home, a trip to Highgate Cemetery allowed him to capture photos of the final resting places of Karl Marx and entertainer Jeremy Beadle. And he was particularly excited to visit the town of Tombstone, Arizona, which got its unusual name from being the site of the Gunfight at the OK Corral. He says that one inspiration for his bizarre hobby is a desire to educate himself about important figures from the past. 'I wasn't very good at history at school and I didn't learn very much,' he said. Bonanza: The grave-hopper has paid a trip to Tombstone, Arizona, named for the Gunfight at the OK Corral .

Will not return to Italy: Amanda Knox today defended her decision not to return to Italy to a face a retrial over the murder of Meredith Kercher in an interview on ITV's Daybreak . Victim: Amanda Knox told Lorraine Kelly that she had been 'hunted down' over the murder of Meredith Kercher in November 2007 . 'I've been hunted. I'm being hunted down,' she told ITV’s Daybreak, adding: 'I'm trying to fight back now that I have the opportunity.' Asked if she would be willing to take a . lie detector test, Ms Knox said: 'I would do anything to prove my . innocence. I don’t think that is necessary, but like I said, I am doing . everything I can to prove my innocence. 'I am not afraid of anything. I have been put through a tremendous gauntlet.' Ms Knox has denied any involvement in the killing of Ms Kercher, who was found with her throat slashed in the bedroom of the house they shared in Perugia, central Italy. She was convicted along with her Italian former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito following a high-profile trial, but the pair were later cleared in 2011 after an appeal court found the prosecution lacking and criticised large swathes of the case against them. Innocent: Ms Knox today said she would take a lie detector test to prove her innocence over the murder . Starting again: Ms Knox, who now lives in Seattle, said she is trying to rebuild her life since being acquitted of the murder . Italy’s supreme court has ordered a new trial but Miss Knox, who now lives in Seattle, has said she will not attend. She said: 'I have plenty to fear because I was already imprisoned wrongfully, I was already convicted wrongfully and this is everything to fear, this, as an innocent person, is the ultimate nightmare, this does not make sense.' Ms Knox added that she is unable to afford to travel to Italy and remain in the country for the duration of a retrial. Mr Sollecito, 29, has denied any involvement in the killing and has appealed for money to fund his new court battle. He is due to face a retrial next Monday. Explaining her reasons for not returning . to Italy for the retrial, Miss Knox said: 'There are many reasons why I . have made the decision. Loss: British student Meredith Kercher was found killed in the apartment the girls shared in Perugia . 'One of the major reasons is because I have done this, I have given testimony ... I can’t financially afford to be going back and forth to Italy. 'I am in school, I am trying to rebuild my life. Then there is the very real fact that I was imprisoned wrongfully and I cannot reconcile that experience with the choice of going back. It doesn’t make sense. 'This isn’t a complicated case. It has been resolved and for people to hold on to circumstantial things that have been proven wrong... At the very beginning, I never had a chance to defend myself. Over the course of the trial, it was shown that I wasn’t the monster that was being made of me.' She added: 'There is proof of my innocence in there being no trace of me in the room where my friend was murdered. 'There was no reason for me to have done this, there is nothing that is a part of me that would ever do something like this. 'It is so scary to have go to through this again, I did not expect this to happen. 'And now I am not sure what to expect because I have two different experiences - I was wrongfully convicted and rightly acquitted for being innocent and now I have to hope that the next court is able to look at this without prejudice and realise that there is proof of my innocence here. 'This isn’t a case about a character, this isn’t a case about a femme fatale, this is a case about my friend who was brutally murdered as she just happened to be home that night.' Ms Knox said she would like Ms Kercher's family to take her to visit her grave and believes that they can help one another with the grieving. 'The greatest closure is for them to . be willing to take me to her grave. I never had a chance to see them . before I was already called the murderer,' she said. Refusal: Speaking on the Today show, Amanda Knox said it was 'common sense' that she will not return to Italy for the re-trial in the murder of her British roommate in 2007. Knox was freed in 2010 . Hitting back: Raffaele Sollecito, who was accused of murdering Meredith Kercher, says the police's handling of his case was 'incompetent'. He claims he was blackmailed into framing Amanda Knox for the crime . Ms . Knox said she understood why Ms Kercher's family might believe she was . involved in her death but insisted the prosecution was wrong and asked . them to consider her innocence. 'I can understand where they're coming from. I know that they think that I had some sort of involvement with Meredith's death. 'I would hope that they would eventually take into consideration even the possibility of my innocence. They need to understand that the prosecution is simply wrong and that their lawyers are wrong. 'I also want them to understand that Meredith really was my friend. She was very kind to me and I had nothing to do with her murder. And I am truly innocent. And I truly believe that the only way that any of us are going to be able to heal from all of this is if we come together and acknowledge the pain that we have all gone through.'

The apparent sweetheart deal with the Google men was made possible under a so-called Nasa Space Agreement allowing their planes to be kept at Moffett Field since 2007. The site happens to be less than three miles from Google's global headquarters. H211 initially agreed to pay the space agency $113,365.74 a month in rent - a price subsequently slashed to $108,938.62 a month after it allowed Nasa to borrow the planes for experiments. But figures seen by NBC in May last year showed that of the 1,039 flights to date, only 155 were used for science. Meanwhile, the planes, which include five Gulfstream Vs, a Boeing 757 and a Boeing 767,  used below-market-rate fuel to travel to such exotic destinations as London, Paris, Cancun, Scotland, Puerto Vallarta, Hawaii, Liberia and Tahiti. Keeping the jets at Moffett Field also gives H211 a tax break. Property kept on federal sites is exempt from the tallying for local property taxes, which means the company pays no county taxes on the aircraft kept there. Santa Clara County Assessor Lawrence Stone told NBC that the exemption means that local government is losing out on between  $400,000 and $500,000 in property taxes per plane per year. Hangar One at Moffett Field: Keeping the planes . at the federal site has enabled the owners to avoid hefty property . taxes, potentially amounting to $500,000 per plane per year, the . investigation has found . Jamie Court, the president and chairman of Consumer Watchdog, called the arrangement 'the greatest sweetheart deal in the history of Nasa'. 'There’s no reason these billionaires should be getting cheaper gas, like the Army, when they’re not doing anything for the government,' he told NBC. 'This is all a ruse to have a landing strip to go party around the world at some of the nicest resorts and the nicest parties with rock stars and celebrities. 'And it’s all being financed by the taxpayer.' Conveniently located: The site happens to be less than three miles from Google's global headquarters . A spokesman for Nasa said the arrangement gave the agency a 'unique component of support' for its earth science missions to measure ozone and greenhouse gases. Google referred NBC's enquiries to H211, whose vice president, Ken Ambrose, said that the company pays the full retail cost for hangar space 'that includes none of the ground support typically included' elsewhere. He furthermore said that, far from the taxpayer losing out, Nasa were in fact $2million better off thanks to the deal. Following enquiries from NBC Bay Area's journalists, the Department of Defense announced that the government will stop selling jet fuel to H211 from August 31, 2013.","Investigation finds firm owned by Google execs keeps jets at Nasa facility .

With tattoos that curl up his arms and around his neck and a burly muscled body, Duncan, a bodybuilder from Swindon, looks every inch the ink fan. But there's a twist. For Duncan, tattoos are an expression of the things that are most important to him and right now, that's his dog, Thor. Thor, who died last year, is to be the subject of Duncan's latest inking: a portrait of the dog, complete with angel wings created from a mixture of tattoo ink - and Thor's ashes. Tearful: Bodybuilder Duncan brushes away a tear as he contemplates the loss of his beloved pet dog Thor . Ashes and ink: Duncan proffers a small packet that contains the remains of his deceased pet dog Thor . Portrait of a pet: Duncan is filmed having angel wings added to this tattooed portrait of Thor on his thigh . Duncan is one of the stars of new Channel 4 documentary, My Tattoo Addiction, which follows the bodybuilder and fellow tattoo fans Paul and Batman-obsessive Chris as they go under the needle for the umpteenth time. For Duncan, that means his memorial portrait of his pet. 'It is hard... I do miss him,' reveals the Swindon tattoo fan, who already has the pets name tattooed across his knuckles. He adds: 'I think it'll be a nice finish to his story... on my skin. It'll be nice to have him with me, to make him part of me. It's going to be a last gesture of ink to the mighty Thor.' Equally enamoured with body art is Duncan's friend Paul, a father of six with more than 70 tattoos - including several that curl around his face. Over the last three years, Paul has gone from clean-skinned to tattooed from head to foot and, incredibly, says that having the etchings has made him more confident. 'I just want to be the most tattooed man in Swindon, really,' he says when asked why he's chosen to have so many inkings. 'I want to beat everyone else out there. I want to be the man with the most tattoos.Some people might just have one tattoo and be done with it but me, I can't stop. I want to get as covered as I can - from head to foot - that's what I want to do.' But having so many tattoos does come with a downside. Paul, who now works piercing ears and other body parts in a local tattoo parlour, was unemployed for two years before being given his current role. 'People look at it and think ""oh, he should be part of the gang and go round beating people up"" - they treat me like scum,' says Paul of people's reactions to his tattooed and pierced visage. And it isn't just people in the street - it's Job Centre staff as well. 'One . of them said in the past, ""don't you think it's your own fault you can't . get a job because of your facial tattoos?""' he revealed. 'It shouldn't make a . difference whether I've got facial tattoos or not,' he complains. 'To me that was a form . of discrimination.' But not everyone gets tattoos because, like Paul, they want to stand out. For some, getting a tattoo is a way of blending in. Man's best friend: Duncan takes his two remaining pet dogs for a walk in the Wiltshire countryside . Full face: Piercing specialist Paul has more than 70 tattoos and has covered his entire head in etchings . Among them is Helen, 43, from . Bedfordshire, who is seen having nipples tattooed onto her reconstructed . breasts which were removed following cancer treatment. 'We went away and I was topless on the . beach,' she reveals. '[My lack of nipples] was a bit obvious walking about on the beach and I just want to be a normal . person like everyone else.' Helen, however, is a rarity. Many more, reveals the documentary, get their tattoos while under the influence - and what the majority get are names. 'A good 60 per cent of customers get a . name on them,' reveals Lancashire tattooist Lee. 'They always think, ""yeah, well we've been together less . than 24 hours now and we love each other so, yeah, lets have a crack at . getting the names"". It never lasts!' Hard time: Because of his body art, Paul found getting a job difficult but now works in a tattoo parlour . In the Spanish resort of Magaluf, a stream of drunken revellers are filmed going into beachside tattoo parlours and having names, symbols and, in one case, a swastika tattooed on their rear ends. Many are bizarre, including the one that reads 'Ginge' in Arabic. 'Most people want three things when they get drunk,' explains Taylor, a club rep based in the resort. 'A kebab, a bird and a tattoo!' It makes Duncan and his doggy tribute seem rather touching, particularly when he rather sweetly adds: 'It's been a year since he passed now and it's still raw, very . raw. I miss him a lot. It's just comforting.' On seeing his completed new tattoo for the first time, he adds: 'People . just see it as tattoos or as artwork. I don't do it for people to ask . me about it. He's [Thor] up there, up there watching over all of us. It's perfect [the tattoo]. I couldn't ask for a better end for the . little man. He's got his little wings attached and he . can flap about happily in heaven.' That surely beats having the name of a one-night wonder tattooed on your backside.

A housemaid who killed her employer's baby girl to spite a colleague has been sentenced to death. The maid, whose name has not been released, was handed the sentence at Abu Dhabi Criminal Court in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The Indonesian woman was found guilty after the court heard she picked up four-month-old baby Malak  from her cot, threw her to the floor and hit her head against a wall repeatedly before putting her back. Murder: The Indonesian maid was convicted of murder in Abu Dhabi in the UAE . It was said she carried out the extraordinary attack on Malak - whose name means 'angel' - to get at a colleague, according to The National. The child's nanny, a Filipino woman, was in the shower at the time and came back to the sight of the injured baby struggling to breathe. She was rushed to the Sheikh Khalifa Hospital in the city, where doctors disagnosed her with a fractured skull and sever brain damage. She died on 28 April this year - two weeks after the attack. In an attempt to frame her, the maid initially blamed Malak's nanny, for the death, but admitted her guilt when she was presented with video footage of her actions. Prosecutors said that she resented her colleague because it was her job to care for Malak and her brother, while the convicted woman had to care for a sick grandmother. Attack: The woman initially tried to blame a colleague for the attack, but admitted her guilt when confronted with video footage. In a previous hearing the nanny said she did not realise how much the maid hated her. Prosecutors said: 'The maid was caught on camera as she lifted the baby from her . bed, threw her on the floor and hit her head against a wall repeatedly'. They have been aggressive in their calls for the death penalty to be given, and rejected offers of blood money - which in the Emirati legal system can allow people to receive reduced sentences in return for a payment. The maid’s defence lawyer Ali Al Abadi told the court in a previous hearing . that his client was suffering from psychological problems that caused . her to attack the child. All death sentences in the UAE are subject to two rounds of appeals, but if these fails the maid will be killed by a firing squad.","Indonesian woman, who had not been named, threw four-month-old baby Malak from her crib and hit her against a wall .

A mother-of-one dropped nearly eight stone in weight through a 'foodtography' diet inspired by the internet craze which sees social network users share photographs of what they are eating. Gillian Gray, 41, from Fife, was fed up of squeezing into size 24 jeans, so vowed to transform her eating habits with a status update on Facebook. She was so touched by the encouraging comments from friends and family that she began regularly posting pictures of the new low-calorie meals. They were all cooked by her supportive husband Steven, with whom she has a 12-year-old daughter, Chloe. Before her Facebook diet, Gillian weighed 17 stone. This picture of her on holiday inspired her to finally lose weight (l). She posted this pictured to her online supporters after losing six-and-a-half stone (r) She said: 'I think it's great when people post pictures of their meals on Facebook so when Steven first made me a healthy dinner - a plate of delicious chilli prawns - I posted a picture because I was so impressed something healthy could taste so good. 'Friends and family posted so many lovely comments about my diet, which really motivated me. 'When the weight started coming off I began posting pictures of myself as I got smaller and smaller.' In just over a year, Gillian shrunk seven dress sizes and dropped to a healthy ten stone, having previously weighed nearly 18 stone. Gillian, pictured with husband Steven before embarking on her Facebook diet . Gillian's weight began to creep up when Steven, then her boyfriend, moved into the family home in 1992 and began cooking for her and her mum, Barbara, now 60, and sister, Val, now 39. The pair wed in 1994 and moved into their own house in Dunfermline, Fife, but Steven continued to cook meals fit for four. Gorging on Steven's lasagne and home baking, Gillian piled on the pounds and was already a size 18 by the time she fell pregnant with daughter Chloe in 2000. Reality only hit home when saw a picture of herself on a caravan holiday in Wales in August 2011. She said: 'I knew I had got bigger, but Steven always told me I looked lovely so I convinced myself I wasn't bothered. The sixth and seventh meals Gillian posted on Facebook, salmon (l) and chicken and apricot meatloaf (r) Gillian posted this picture to her online supporters after losing one stone . 'But when I saw that picture, I was horrified. I knew I had to go on a diet and joined a slimming club.'Stepping on the scales, I couldn't believe I was 17st 10lbs.' To combat her nerves, Gillian posted the first meal in her new regime of low-fat, portion-controlled diet on Facebook, and received dozens of supportive messages and 'likes'. Enormously encouraged, she posted updates and pictures of her meals every evening. Word of her online diet diary spread and soon she was receiving Facebook friend requests from people she had never met, desperate for tips on healthy eating. She said: 'The effect on my confidence was amazing. Within a week of posting the picture of my first meal, I'd lost nearly 4lbs. Gillian posted this picture after losing four-and-a-half stone . Gillian, pictured recently before a glamorous night out, as she approached her target weight . 'I was also inspired to start exercising and I was soon walking everywhere. 'Friends of friends who wanted to lose weight also added me on Facebook so they could see the meals Steven was making for me.' Four months later, Gillian was already three stone lighter. Before beginning her reduced-calorie diet, breakfast for Gillian would typically involve a full cooked meal of sausage, bacon, eggs, potato scone and black pudding, followed by a mid-morning snack of crisps or chocolate with a glass of cola. Lunch would be a Big Mac Meal and, in the evening, she would tuck into lasagna and chips, with crisps and dips to nibble on before bedtime. The new, health-conscious Gillian enjoys fibre-rich cereal or a poached egg for breakfast and fruit during the morning, with soup and pitta bread for lunch. Dinner typically involves low-calorie noodles and seafood, with low fat yogurt for a snack. But as she got closer to her target, she found it harder to shift the last few pounds - and it was the support from Facebook friends that kept her going. She said: 'I was only losing a few pounds a week towards the end and it felt like I would never get there. 'But people were still amazing. They kept posting messages of support, telling me I was nearly there.'Even if I had just lost a few pounds, they would spur me on by reminding me that I hadn't put any weight back on.' Gillian pictured recently, weighing a healthy ten stone, almost eight stone less than her heaviest . Gillian hit her target just a few days before Christmas last year and celebrated by showing off her new size 10 jeans. She said: 'The best thing was seeing the look on Steven's face. Hearing your husband tell you you're a knockout is amazing.' Even though Gillian has reached her target, she has not abandoned her Facebook supporters.She said: 'Lots of people who have followed my journey on Facebook now want to lose weight themselves, and I'm right behind them. 'For me, social media was a brilliant motivator and I know that other people can achieve what I have by sharing their journey. 'We're still posting pictures of our dinners and now people are asking for the recipes. 'I never thought Facebook would help me lose that much weight. Now I tell people, if I can do it, they can too.'","Gillian Gray, 41, of Fife, started posting her healthy meals on Facebook .

"By . Reuters Reporter and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:04 EST, 25 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:26 EST, 25 September 2013 . At least 350 federal background checks for security clearances have been faked by corrupt employees in the last eight years, a shocking new report reveals. Authorities have arrested 21 contractors and special agents working for the Office of Personnel Management from 2004 to 2012 for lying about thoroughly researching candidates for 'secret' and 'top secret' government security clearances. Seven of those employees worked for USIS, a Virginia-based company that has come under scrutiny for its role in . vetting former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden and . more recently, Washington Navy Yard shooter Aaron Alexis. Questions: Navy Yard shooter Aaron Alexis, left, and to NSA leaker Edward Snowden, right, were both granted government security clearances - leading to questions about whether background checking is too lax . Last week, Alexis - who had 'secret' security clearance despite a history of run-ins with the police and reports of mental instability - killed 13 people and wounded three others in a rampage at the Navy Yard. In one case corruption case, a private contractor investigator, who pleaded guilty to . making a false statement, reported interviewing a person who had died . more than a decade earlier. Another investigator was found guilty . of making false statements in checks for applicants seeking 'top . secret' clearances for jobs in the Air Force, Army, Navy and U.S. Treasury. Reuters discovered the 350 known cases of background check fraud by reviewing court documents and press releases from prosecutors for 21 cases resulting in convictions that involved the making of false statements from December 2004 to March 2012. These are the cases government officials have cited to assert that action is taken against investigators who falsely claim to have reviewed records or done interviews for background checks submitted to OPM. Not all the cases identified a specific number of fabrications. Investigated: USIS, a government contractor who does the bulk of the government background screening for security clearances, is under investigation for its ties to both Snowden and Alexis . The 350 falsified reports represent only a small percentage of the number of background investigations conducted each year, either by OPM's own investigators or a handful of private contractors it uses for most of the work. The Government Accountability Office testified to a congressional committee in June that OPM received over $1 billion to conduct more than 2 million background investigations for government employees in fiscal 2011. But the details of the cases show how cracks in the system may allow employees to obtain clearances without proper vetting. The highest number of convictions, 11, involved special agents for OPM. Another seven convictions were of employees of USIS, . Two of those USIS investigators had the highest number - more than four dozen each - of flawed background check reports sent to OPM, court documents showed. USIS faces an ongoing investigation by OPM's inspector general. The company declined to comment for this story and OPM's inspector general's office would not comment on its probe. Tragic: Alexis killed 13 people after waltzing past security at the Washington Navy Yard because he had been granted 'secret' clearance . The most severe punishment was given to an investigator who did not take a plea agreement and instead went to trial. This investigator was found guilty of six counts of making false statements and sentenced to 27 months in prison. Those who entered plea agreements generally received sentences of probation and community service, courts records show. ALEXIS, SNOWDEN CLEARANCES . In a statement last week after 13 people died in shootings at the Navy Yard, including shooter Alexis, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia said, 'In light of recent events, we plan to step up our efforts to investigate and prosecute the individuals and companies who risk our security by cutting corners and falsifying information in background checks.' In pressing the cases, prosecutors have required defendants to pay more than $1.5 million in restitution to the U.S. government to recover the costs of redoing improper background investigations. The screening process for security clearances has came under heightened scrutiny this year since Snowden, working as a contract employee assigned to the National Security Agency, used his 'top-secret' clearance to access documents on the agency's electronic eavesdropping that he later gave to the news media. The issue resurfaced last week with reports that Alexis held a 'secret' security clearance despite violent episodes before and after he received it. A secret clearance generally lasts 10 years. Ongoing checks are needed because 'in five to 10 years stuff happens and people change,' a Senate aide said on condition of anonymity. The Navy Yard shooting has led lawmakers to call for a review of the background check process and a re-examination of the way employees are granted clearance . OPM contracts out for most of the background check work. But the decision to grant security clearances rests with the government agency that intends to employ the individual. USIS conducts about 65 percent of the background checks done by private contractors, and more than half of all the investigations conducted by the OPM, according to a statement issued last week by the office of Senator Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat who is a co-sponsor of legislation aimed at boosting oversight of the security clearance process. Investigators for other government contractors, including CACI International Inc, were also convicted of making false statements in reports for security clearance background checks. CACI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Senate aide said the USIS investigation by OPM's inspector general revolves around systemic problems in the company's procedures and does not focus on individual investigators. The inspector general also is investigating the background check done for Alexis before he received clearance to work for the Navy. In 2012, there were 3.5 million federal employees and 1.1 million contractors who held a 'secret' or 'top secret' clearance and OPM's security clearance and background investigations cost about $1 billion, McCaskill's office said. The OPM inspector general's office told Reuters it has 68 open cases related to OPM's background investigations program. It did not say how many of those involve report falsifications. The inspector general's office said it has referred 22 former background investigators for debarment, but no decisions have been reached by OPM. A debarment is usually for a specific time period and means the person cannot contract with another federal agency. The Senate Homeland Security Committee has scheduled an October 1 hearing on government clearances and background checks.","Federal prosecutors have charged 21 federal employees and contractors with lying about vetting candidates for 'secret' or 'top secret' clearance .

The Obama administration on Tuesday sought dismissal of a lawsuit by the businesswoman whose complaint to the FBI led to General David Petraeus' ouster as CIA director. If a federal judge allows the lawsuit by Jill Kelley to proceed, the case could delve into the roles played in the Petraeus scandal by the FBI, the Pentagon and other parts of the Obama administration. Kelley wants to find out who in the U.S. government leaked her name and some of her emails to the media amid the uproar over Petraeus' affair with Paula Broadwell, author of a biography on Petraeus called All In. Jill Kelley, right, and her husband Scott Kelley, left, are seeking an apology and financial compensation from the government for allegedly leaking her name in the scandal that brought down Gen. David Petraeus . The leaks placed the socialite in . the middle of an avalanche of unfavorable publicity and as a result, she . shouldered the blame as the villain in the downfall of Petraeus and . General John Allen, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, the lawsuit . states. The suit claims the leaks violated . the Privacy Act, which was enacted in 1974 after revelations of illegal . surveillance by federal agencies in the Watergate scandal. The law seeks to protect individuals . from unwarranted invasions of privacy by federal agencies that maintain . sensitive information about them. The Justice Department said in a . court filing that Kelley has failed to present any facts suggesting that . the FBI and the Pentagon flagrantly disregarded her privacy rights. 'A bare allegation' that information . was retrieved from government files is insufficient to sustain a claim . that the government engaged in an unlawful disclosure about Kelley, the . Justice Department said. The FBI and the Pentagon have . exempted several of their record systems from the requirements of the . Privacy Act and Kelley and her husband, who also is a plaintiff in the . case, fail to say whether the leaked information was in a system of . records that was subject to the Privacy Act's requirements, the court . filing states. Allegations: The suit says the FBI did not provide Kelley the security protection a victim is entitled to because the bureau wanted to avoid attention before the upcoming presidential election . The Justice Department does not deny . the government leaked adverse information about the Kelleys, or that the . Kelleys were damaged, one of their lawyers, Alan Raul, said Tuesday . night. Rather, the Justice Department relies . on the supposed fact that the FBI and Defense Department have opted . their records out of Privacy Act protections, said Raul. In an act that triggered the criminal . probe resulting in Petraeus' forced resignation, Kelley told the FBI . she and several U.S. top military officers had been the recipients of . anonymous harassing emails. Kelley and her husband 'sought to do the right thing by reporting the facts' to the FBI, the lawsuit alleges. But 'rather than protect the Kelleys' privacy interests as the law and their duty required, defendants . instead willfully and maliciously thrust the Kelleys into the maw of . public scrutiny concerning one of the most widely reported sex scandals . to rock the United States government'. Some of the anonymous emails ultimately traced to Broadwell were sent to Allen. The messages included notes on the general's plans to see Kelley in Washington the following week. Allen was concerned about how anyone else would know about his personal plans. Former CIA Director David Petraeus shakes hands with author Paula Broadwell. It was later revealed that the two were having an affair . One email mentioned Petraeus and an . upcoming social event and military and intelligence meeting with NATO . leaders in Washington. The emails to the generals claimed Kelley was up to no good and impugned her motives for befriending the military leaders. The lawsuit says the U.S. government . 'unforgivably transformed Mrs Kelley's reputation from that of a . respected business and community leader'. According to the lawsuit, the FBI . Washington cyber division and FBI Deputy Director Sean Joyce directed . agents in the Tampa Field office to treat the Kelleys' case differently . than normal criminal investigations. For example, the suit says, the FBI . did not provide Kelley with security protection to which a victim is . entitled because the bureau wanted to avoid attention before the . upcoming presidential election. The lawsuit also says the FBI in . Washington directed investigating agents not to proceed with a scheduled . effort to interview Broadwell once the agents had determined she was . the stalker. Government officials violated the . Constitution's ban on unreasonable searches in its review of Kelley's . emails, the suit claims. It alleges they have suffered . financial losses because of the government's actions. They are seeking . monetary damages and an apology, among other things. Former CIA director and retired general David H. Petraeus speaks at the University of Southern California after an affair with author Paula Broadwell ended his distinguished career in the military . In the fallout from the scandal, Kelley was stripped of her role as a honorary consul for South Korea. She was forced to return her vanity car registration plates and banned from MacDill Airforce Base.","Kelley is seeking both an apology and financial compensation after she claims her identity was leaked to the media by people at the FBI and the Department of Defense .

Audrionna Rhoads, 21, appeared upset during her arraignment for second degree murder and child negligent abuse, which carry a life sentence and a 15 year sentence respectively. She was arrested yesterday after the body of her son James Nelson was found still buckled in to his car seat at 6pm on Tuesday, September 3rd.

But authorities believe she put the toddler in the car at 8.30am before driving another car off to work, meaning he was trapped for between 10 and 11 hours.

Jail cell footage has been released showing a couple who allegedly kidnapped their toddler sons and fled to Cuba on a sailboat discussing the plot - and desperately urging each other to stay quiet. Joshua and Sharyn Hakken, from Tampa, Florida, are seen embracing, kissing and apparently talking about what they will say about the kidnapping on the video released by prosecutors. Among other documents released this week, prosecutors have also shared a bizarre love letter Sharyn Hakken sent to a 26-year-old woman whom she met in prison, in which she tells the former inmate she is '100% committed to you and our relationship'. The Hakkens were charged with kidnapping, interference with child custody and neglect in April after they allegedly kidnapped two-year-old Chase and four-year-old Cole from the boys' grandparents, who had been granted custody of them just a week earlier. Caught on camera: Joshua Hakken embraces his wife Sharyn in jail shortly after they are arrested for kidnapping their two toddler sons and fleeing to Cuba. The video shows them discussing the plot . Keeping quiet: Joshua Hakken urges his wife not to speak to her cellmates about the kidnapping as he comforts her in the cell. The footage could be used as evidence in their kidnapping trial . After the couple were tracked down in Cuba and returned to the U.S., they were held in a Hillsborough County jail, where surveillance cameras filmed their conversations on April 10. 'Be careful what you say to your cellmates,' Joshua Hakken, 45, says to his wife. 'No one can know about this.' 'I know, I know, I know,' responds Sharyn Hakken, 34, later adding, 'I said too much on the plane', as her husband comforts her, ABC News reported. The couple, who have both pleaded not guilty to the kidnapping charges, also apparently discussed their release from jail. Arrest: Sharyn Hakken, left, and her husband Joshua, right, allegedly kidnapped their sons, aged two and four, a week after Sharyn's mother had been granted custody of the boys . Affair: Lacrecia White, pictured, said that she met Sharyn Hakken in prison and they continue to write to each other. Prosecutors have released the letters, in which Hakken tells White she loves her . Devotion: The letters called White her 'soul mate' and tell her she is 100% committed to their relationship . As part of the documents prosecutors released this week in the Hakken case, they shared a letter written from Sharyn Hakken to a woman. The woman, Lacrecia White, told ABC Action News that they had met in prison in July before she was released. Here are some excerpts from the letter from Hakken: . 'I hope I dream about you tonight. I need to see you and feel you. I love you. Ugh I so badly wish we could hold each other right now. I wanna play with your hair! 'I am so super excited about our future together... 'I want to talk to you and hear your . voice sooo bad... So how are you my beautiful girl? I miss you so much. 'I love you so much. I hope you really do know that by now... I am 100% fully committed to you and our relationship! 'Let's get married!

I don't think I'd be able to!' 'When everything goes down I'll come . find you,' Joshua Hakken said, with his wife adding: 'If I get out . before you, I promise I'll wait for you.' Prosecutors plan to present the footage as evidence at a trial later this year. They also released photographs taken inside the Hakken's sailboat that show two child car seats, a gun and ammunition. Other documents included love letters Sharyn Hakken sent to a 26-year-old woman. The woman, Lacrecia White, gave an interview to ABC Action News and explained that they had hit it off while playing cards together in jail in July. One . letter from Hakken reads: 'I want to talk to you and hear your voice . sooo bad. So how are you my beautiful girl? I miss you so much. I'm glad . I stayed up so late writing to you last night. 'I love you so much. I hope you really do know that by now... I am 100% fully committed to you and our relationship!' White, who has since been released on probation and is training to become an electrician, said that Hakken spends her days doing yoga and missing her children. 'I know that her overall goal is to get her kids back. She says that when she gets out of jail, she wants to start in with a case plan, if that's even possible,” said White. 'We'll definitely keep writing each other. I need her support and she needs a friend right now.' Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames.

A World War II veteran who faced eviction because he smokes cigarettes in his building's breezeway rather than the designated smoking area has been allowed to continue living in the complex. Andy Nowicki and his wife, who are both 90-years-old, were informed that they would have to move out of their Newington, Connecticut apartment over his smoking habit but the case caused an immediate backlash. Now the Housing Authority in Newington has ruled that the Nowickis will be able to stay in their home after coming to a settlement with their landlords. War hero: Andy Nowicki enjoys a cigarette in front of the apartment from which he and his wife faced eviction, but now they have struck a deal with administrators to allow them to stay . Habit: Nowicki started smoking while fighting the Nazis. He says he's tried to quit but can't . The agreement stipulates that the . apartment complex must be made more handicap-accessible so that Mr . Nowicki, who uses a motorized wheelchair, can smoke under an awning in . the designated smoking area. 'I . think today common sense prevailed. This should have happened months . ago. This guy is a true American hero,' said state senator Paul Doyle who . represented Mr Nowicki's case free of charge. Mr . Nowicki won a Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts during the war, was a . combat infantryman fighting the Nazis in Africa, Italy, France and . Germany. The Army is where . he picked up his smoking habit 70 years ago, as Uncle Sam provided . soldiers with free cigarettes during the war. New Policy: The smoking restrictions were put in place at Cedar Village apartments in January 2012 . His . daughter Janet had no idea where her parents would go if they are . forced from their $714-a-month apartment as the couple lives on a small, . fixed income. Additionally, . Mr. Nowicki's wife, Leona, is in the very late stages of Alzheimer's - . most of the time, she barely even recognizes her husband of nearly 70 . years. 'Personally, I couldn't sleep at night evicting a 90-year-old war hero from government-subsidized housing,' Doyle said. 'It's . just totally incredible to me that we can't find an exception to the . rules. I think common sense should prevail and let Mr. Nowicki live out . his life because of what he did for all of us.' A change had to be made no matter what, as Mr Nowicki's health was at risk- and not just from his smoking habit. Compromise: State Senator Paul Doyle is acting as the Nowicki's attorney helped them reach a compromise . His family says that he broke two of his ribs two weeks ago when he was returning to his apartment from smoking. Adding to that, his previous attempts at quitting have failed. 'Are you kidding? I got the best doctor in the world. He gave me gum. He gave me the patch,' Mr Nowicki said. The . Housing Authority in charge of the complex eventually agreed, with . their lawyer telling The Hartford Courant that in the end both parties . were able to settle on the agreement. 'We were happy to accommodate him to make the apartment more handicapped accessible,' lawyer Elliot Lane told the paper.","Andy Nowicki started smoking in the Army when the U.S. government gave him free cigarettes as he fought the Nazis in Europe and Africa .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 09:56 EST, 24 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:19 EST, 25 September 2013 . A White House official said Tuesday that while it would welcome 'an encounter' between President Barack Obama and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in . New York, Iranian officials have turned them down. Obama told the United Nations General . Assembly on Tuesday that the United States is primarily focusing its diplomatic efforts . on Iran's nuclear program and the Israel-Palestinian conflict. The . U.S., he said, will support Iran's use of nuclear energy, and will . attempt to negotiate directly with Rouhani. 'Americans see an Iranian government that has declared the United States an enemy,' he said, 'and directly – or through proxies – taken Americans hostage, killed U.S. troops and civilians, and threatened our ally Israel with destruction.' 'I don’t believe this difficult history can be overcome overnight – the suspicion runs too deep. But I do believe that if we can resolve the issue of Iran’s nuclear program, that can serve as a major step down a long road towards a different relationship – one based on mutual interests and mutual respect. That phrase – mutual respect – is one that Iran has used lately to demonstrate its eagerness for acceptance in the West. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Obama told the UN that 'the world is more stable than it was 5 years ago,' but then spoke of the shopping mall massacre in Kenya and suicide bombings in Pakistan . Bashar al-Assad has been pleading his case on television in country after country -- in this case, Monday on Chinese state CCTV. He cautioned that rebels might block inspectors from reaching some of the locations where chemical weapons are stored . 'The Iranians have an internal dynamic that they have to manage and the relationship with the United States is clearly quite different than the relationship that Iran has with other Western nations,"" a senior administration official told Politico. Obama said he had instructed Secretary of State John Kerry to talk directly with Iran. He . also demanded a UN Security Council resolution on Tuesday that would . hold Syrian President Bashar al-Assad responsible for an August 21 . chemical weapons attack that killed more than 1,400, saying 'the evidence is overwhelming' that the Syrian dictator was behind the action. 'It's an insult to human reason ... to suggest that anyone other than the regime carried out this attack,' Obama said. And in a defense of the United States, Obama claimed American exceptionalism is alive and well. 'Some may disagree, but I believe America is exceptional,' he told the General Assembly, standing up 'for the interests of all.' In . a New York Times op-ed earlier this month, Russian President Vladimir . Putin wrote that it is 'extremely dangerous to encourage people to see . themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation.' U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (R) and UN Ambassador Samantha Power (L) listened to Obama with rapt attention Tuesday . Obama (on screen) addressed the 68th United Nations General Assembly at the UN in New York . Noting that Assad has 'given an . accounting' of its chemical weapons stockpiles and promised to have them . dismantled, Obama told diplomats that 'there must be a strong Security . Council resolution to verify that the Assad regime is keeping its . commitments.' 'There must . be consequences if they fail to do so,' the president added. 'If we . cannot agree even on this, then it will show that the United Nations is . incapable of enforcing the most basic of international laws.' Obama said Tuesday that he had written a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, emphasizing that he wants a diplomatic solution to Iran's growing nuclear program . 'Our . response has not matched the scale of the challenge' in Syria, Obama . said, where 'peaceful protests against an authoritarian regime were met . with oppression and slaughter.' While . Obama demanded a Security Council resolution that provides a penalty if . Syria renegs on its commitment, he reiterated that his preference 'has . always been a diplomatic resolution to this issue' And, he said, he has no desire to determine who leads Syria, whether it's Assad or a replacement. 'That's . for the Syrian people to decide,' he said, noting that U.S.-led regime . change in other parts of the world have been fraught with unintended . consequences. 'The United States has a hard-earned . humility when it comes to our ability to determine events inside other . people's countries,' Obama conceded. But, he insisted, the U.S. must remain engaged in Syria for its own national security reasons. The White House said after Obama's . speech that the United States will provide $339 million in new Syrian . humanitarian aid, bringing the U.S. funding total to nearly $1.4 . billion. That humanitarian . assistance, the administration said, includes food, clean water, . shelter, medical care, and relief supplies to over 4.2 million people . inside Syria and more than two million refugees. At a luncheon event Tuesday, Obama thanked the UN for providing the weapons inspectors who determined the scale of the Aug. 21 chemical weapons attack in a Damascus suburb and collected evidence of who was to blame. 'The dedicated U.N. inspectors in Damascus,' he said, 'set out into battlefield conditions.  They braved sniper fire. They worked diligently with great professionalism. They uncovered the truth, and they have the thanks of the world.' Obama sat high on the dais and far apart from the diplomats in New York, before his 40-minute address . Rep. Ed Royce said the U.S. should 'double down' on sanctions against Iran in order to avoid repeating the mistakes made with North Korea . Iranian President Hassan Rouhani continues to pursue his country's nuclear program, while Obama cautions against the development of atomic weapons . John Bolton, the former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, was critical of both the Security Council and the General Assembly, writing on Tuesday that its usefulness is limited. 'There is no such thing as the United Nations,' Bolton wrote in The Washington Times. 'It is simply a collection of nations pursuing their respective interests, from time to time led by the United States.' Rep. Ed Royce, the California Republican who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told Fox News that in dealing with Iran, the U.S. should look at 'the mistake we made in 2005 or 2006' in lifting sanctions against North Korea, allowing then-president Kim Jong-Il to drag out negotiations while he built a nuclear weapons program. 'Instead,' he said, 'we should double down' on Iranian sanctions and force President Rouhani's hand. Speaking of Iran, the president said that he had written both Rouhani and Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei to say 'that America prefers to resolve our concerns over Iran’s nuclear program peacefully, but that we are determined to prevent them from developing a nuclear weapon.' 'We are not seeking regime change, and we respect the right of the Iranian people to access peaceful nuclear energy,' he insisted.","Obama has told Secretary of State John Kerry to talk directly with Iran's diplomats for the first time .

Another House staffer found the gun and reported it to police. A gun safety group today called for Evans to be fired after he left the gun in the basement bathroom in Jefferson City, Missouri. Danger: Dave Evans (left), a legislative assistant to House Speaker Tim Jones (pictured right), left a loaded handgun in a bathroom at the State Capitol building in Missouri on Friday . A gun safety group is calling for a Missouri House staffer to be fired after he left a loaded handgun unattended in a Capitol bathroom in Jefferson Ci . Rebecca Morgan, spokeswoman for the Missouri chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, said: 'Any child could’ve found that gun, or someone could’ve found it and resold it.' According to the police report, Evans has a concealed-carry permit. Police returned the gun to him, and no charges were filed. A 2011 law allows legislative staff with concealed-carry permits to bring firearms into the Capitol. Tom Smith, Jones’ chief of staff, said in a statement on Tuesday that Evans will take a gun safety course in the next few weeks as a result of the incident. 'He is extremely remorseful about this unfortunate incident and willing to take full accountability for his mistake,' Mr Smith said. Ms Morgan said the Missouri chapter of Moms Demand Action has asked Jones to issue an apology and to fire Evans. The . organization is also calling schools and asking them to cancel their . planned field trips to the Capitol, which houses the Missouri State . Museum. Dave Evans, left a Kahr CM9 9 mm gun, in a public bathroom stall at the Capitol building in Missouri (stock image) The museum received more than 470,000 visitors last year, according to its website. Of those, 30,000 were children on guided tours, according to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. Morgan said that just as mothers call their children’s friends’ houses before play dates to make sure all firearms are secured, parents and schools should be aware of safety risks within the Capitol building. 'My son is supposed to go later in the school year, and I don’t feel safe sending him to the Capitol,' she said. The Moms Demand Action group hopes its effort will help change the 2011 concealed-carry law. 'If (Evans) can have his fully loaded, ready-to-shoot, unattended gun in a restroom and there’s no law against it, the law needs to change,' Morgan said. She said the organization received no direct response from the Capitol. Moms Demand Action describes itself as a grassroots organization that formed nationwide after the December 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. 'It’s just a crying shame,' Morgan said of the unattended gun. 'It’s our responsibility as parents and as legislators to make sure that it doesn’t take losing a child’s life to change this law.'","Dave Evans, legislative assistant .

A morbidly obese bus inspector who tipped the scales at 31st 7lb has shed more than half his body weight after being shamed for taking up multiple seats on the tube. Philip Kettle, 52, from Romford, was carrying around the equivalent of 128 bags of sugar in weight after eating unhealthily for almost two decades. But after warnings from doctors and daily angry stares from commuters, Philip decided to overhaul his diet and now weighs a trim 14st 7lb. Slimline: Bus conductor Philip Kettle poses in one of his old XXXXXL blazers after losing a colossal 17st . Big change: Philip now weighs just 14st 7lb but used to weigh a mighty 31st 7lb and was morbidly obese . 'When you are that size you become . withdrawn, withdrawn from society, you don't want to go out to things . because people will look at you,' Phillip revealed. 'You . become very self conscious that you are being scrutinised. Looks are . one thing but the emotional side also takes a right pounding. 'I was ashamed. I was not proud of what I had done to myself over the years.' At his biggest, Philip had a 60in waist and struggled with simple activities such as climbing the stairs and keeping up with his five-year-old grandson. 'I was eating chocolate bars and various junk food all the time - I have a very sweet tooth,' he added. 'But my health started to deteriorate. I had very high blood pressure. It was quite a shock to hear what the GP said. I was at that point in my life that I realised I had put my family through a lot by being this way.' Particularly hard for Philip was the realisation that he might not live to see his grandson grow up, which made him increasingly desperate to shed the pounds. 'I was very overweight throughout my daughter's lives but now I have a grandson,' he said. 'I . didn't want him remembering his grandfather like that. I couldn't do . anything about the past but I could so something about the future. Relieved: Wife Denise, 52, is thrilled that her husband has finally managed to shift the pounds . Unhealthy: Philip was warned that he might not see his grandson grow up unless he lost weight . 'I . had just carried on and put off doing something about it for years. But . it got to a point where I could not carry on. It was becoming too much.' Philip's solution was to join Weightwatcher's where he was swiftly put on a programme that replaced daily English breakfasts and carb-laden sandwiches with healthy salads, fruit and vegetables. Snacking was banned, while weekly weigh-ins helped to keep him on track as the pounds slowly but surely dropped off. He also started walking everywhere and two years later, he now weighs just 14st 7lb and has a trim 34in waist. 'My . blood pressure is back to normal, I am physically fit and I'm off all . my medication - the doctor said I have got my health back,' said Philip. 'I used to go . everywhere in the car, even short journeys, but now I walk everywhere. I . walk to work and as much as I can and only use the car once a week. 'I'm even doing a 26-mile walk for charity, which before was something I could never of imagined doing. 'Everything has changed now.

In a highlighted reel from this week's episode of 'Under Wild Skies,' host Tony Makris - who is a lobbyist for the National Rifle Association - is filmed hunting an elephant in Botswana with a guide. Makris and the guide hide behind brush about 20 feet away from the animal and talk about shooting it in the face, before Makris fires a couple shots. Scroll down for video .

Makris, pictured, hits the animal - but does not kill it. The elephant shrieks in pain and runs off, but doesn't get far enough away to escape its fate. 'I'm bent over literally shootin' through a hole in the trees,' he says to the guide, just before firing the two shots. He hits the animal, but does not kill it. The elephant cries out in pain and runs off, but doesn't get far enough away to escape its fate. Makris fires another shot and the animal lets out a long, loud groan. Then Makris begins chuckling. 'Somebody got a little cheeky there,' he says breathlessly, apparently referring to the elephant's struggle to stay alive. 'Can we shoot some birds this afternoon, or...?' he adds. In the next shot, Makris and the hunting guide are standing next to the lifeless elephant. The elephant that was killed during the filming of 'Under Wild Skies' is pictured while still alive .

Afterwards, the men celebrate by drinking champagne. Deadspin, which first reported on the show, points out that a ban on hunting elephants is set to go into effect in Botswana in 2014. Some NBC Sports viewers are now calling on the network to cancel the show. Twitter user Mike Potter called NBC's airing of the show 'outrageous, obscene, unforgivable and just plain wrong.' Another user added: 'Shame on you for ""Under Wild Skies."" Elephants are endangered and this is NOT a sport. I will no longer watch NBC Sports.' Makris is the chairman of Mercury Group, a public relations agency that is largely responsible for transforming the NRA from a sportsman's group into one of Washington's most powerful lobbying organizations .

Victim: Marvin Samuels, 31, allegedly raped a lone dog walker because she looked like his ex-girlfriend Sharlana Diedrick (pictured), whom he stabbed to death hours later . A man raped a lone dog walker because she looked like his ex-girlfriend, whom he went on to kill hours later, a court has heard. Marvin Samuels attacked the 43-year-old woman as . she walked her chihuahua around Welsh Harp reservoir in Brent, London, it is claimed. The heavily-built, tattooed 31-year-old dragged her into the undergrowth, before ordering her to strip naked and raping her, a jury heard. He then allegedly tried to strangle her with her scarf, before repeatedly beating her over the head with a bottle and tree branch and leaving her for dead. Just hours later, Samuels stabbed to death his ex-girlfriend and mother of his child Sharlana Diedrick, 32, as she sat in her car near his home in Stonebridge, the Old Bailey heard. He allegedly knifed the mother-of-four 16 times in the chest and abdomen at about 11.10pm on September 29 last year, before calmly walking away. Neighbours reported hearing the mother-of-four screaming: 'Help, somebody help, he's stabbing me'. Maureen . Jones, who rushed to help, said: 'As I got to the car, I saw her . eyes were open and blood was around her neck - I could see cuts on her . arm. 'She took a gasp of air, and to me, it was like her last breath.' Within minutes of the frenzied attack, shaven-headed Samuels sent his mother a text message with just a kiss in it and was later spotted on CCTV sprinting down Argenta Way in Neasden. He was then seen creeping into the back entrance of a nearby Travelodge at 12.10am - only emerging again at 2.29am. Wearing fresh clothes and a bandage around his hand, he handed himself into police at 3,30am, and confessed he had dumped his blood-stained clothes and changed at a friend's house. The woman he allegedly raped was found naked and badly beaten by her husband and . his friends the next day. Crime scene: The 43-year-old woman was attacked as she walked her chihuahua around Welsh Harp reservoir - also known as the Brent reservoir - in north-west London . She was taken to hospital, but has not been able to give an account of what happened to her. Duncan Atkinson, prosecuting, said: 'She and the defendant were complete . strangers to each other. She simply was in the wrong place at the wrong . time. She had a resemblance to a second woman who was attacked.' He said that Samuels had claimed he had been 'stressed' about his relationship with Miss Diedrick at the time of the assault. 'He attacked the woman while stressed . about his relationship with Sharlana Diedrick. He said he knew what he . was doing,' said Mr Atkinson. 'He encountered the women when when he was about to leave the . reservoir, started to talk to her, pulled her into the undergrowth and . hit her. Trial: Samuels has admitted raping the lone dog walker, but had denied her attempted murder and the murder of Miss Diedrick at the Old Bailey (pictured) 'He then directed her to undress and then raped her. He then . started to choke her with her scarf and struck her head first with a . bottle and then a branch. 'Having left her for dead, only a few hours later . the defendant stabbed Sharlana Diedrick as she sat . in her car using a knife which he had armed himself with in advance.' He told the jury Samuels and Miss Diedrick had been in an on-off relationship which was marred by violence. Before her death, the court heard Miss Diedrick had picked up Samuels in Watford and they had started arguing over their son's childcare arrangements. She had agreed to drive him to his mother's home in Conduit Way, parking around the corner to avoid being seen together. It is then that they argued again and he launched the frenzied stabbing attack, the jury heard. Samuels . surrendered to police in the early hours of the following morning and . told detectives he was responsible for the assault on Miss Diedrick. He claimed to have not been in the right frame of mind, but is yet to formally enter a defense of diminished responsibility. Describing the stabbing, he told police: 'I was feeling unusual. I was different that day, I wasn't in my right mind. I was awful crazy.' Mr . Atkinson said: 'The defendant admitted . he had lost it completely. He further admitted stabbing Miss . Diedrick in the car during the argument. 'He described feeling not . quite right in his mind. Miss Diedrick had not been violent to him and . it was all him. 'He would have stabbed her more had he not hurt his hand . during the attack.' Samuels told officers that his ex-girlfriend had begged him to stop, but he only relented when he realised he had suffered deep wounds to two of his fingers in the attack. He also admitted raping the lone dog walker, and causing her grievous bodily harm, after forensics linked him to the assault. However, he has denied her attempted murder and the murder of Miss Diedrick. Mr Atkinson told the jury that they had to decide what Samuels’ mental state was at the time of both attacks. The trial continues.

"By . Gerri Peev . PUBLISHED: . 19:10 EST, 25 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:03 EST, 26 September 2013 . More access: Lord Younger told MPs that Google had better access to Number 10 than him . A Tory minister has complained that he has less access to Downing Street than Google’s executives. Viscount Younger of Leckie’s admission is the latest demonstration of the internet firm’s political clout. It emerged in a report from the Committee for Culture, Media and Sport, which lambasted Google for its ‘flimsy excuses’ for not tackling online piracy. It also slammed the company for directing users to websites where they can illegally download material. The committee said it has proved exceedingly difficult to introduce tougher sanctions for internet pirates, in the face of reluctance from web giants such as Google. ‘We have also heard complaints from across the creative spectrum about the perceived power and influence of Google in the Government’s inner, policy-making sanctum,’ the report said. It went on to quote Lord Younger, the Intellectual Property Minister, who had given evidence to the committee. ‘The minister hardly dispelled this impression: “Google is one of several search engines,” he told us. “I am very aware of their power, put it that way. I am also very aware, I think, that they have access, for whatever reason, to higher levels than me in No. 10, I understand.”’ The Daily Mail revealed last year that Tory ministers had held meetings with Google an average of once a month since the General Election. David Cameron has also been criticised for surrounding himself with Google cronies. Rachel Whetstone, the company’s global head of communications, worked with Mr Cameron at Carlton Television and the Prime Minister is godfather to her youngest son. She is married to Steve Hilton, Mr Cameron’s former policy guru. Tory MP John Whittingdale, the CMS committee chairman, said it could not be ‘beyond the wit’ of Google engineers to block websites which offered illegal downloads of music, film and video games. Illegal downloads cost the creative industries an estimated £400million a year. Creative industries worth more than £36billion to Britain would be ‘put at risk’ if creators could not rely on intellectual property rights being ‘robustly enforced’, Mr Whittingdale added. The Daily Mail's story from May 19, 2012, which highlighted the internet giant's influence on the Government's policy . ‘We are unimpressed by Google’s . failure to stop directing consumers to illegal, copyright-infringing . material on the flimsy excuse that some of the sites may also host some . legal content. ‘The . continuing promotion of illegal content through search engines is simply . unacceptable, and efforts to stop it have so far been derisory. Insider: Google's head of communications Rachel Whetsone, pictured, worked with David Cameron at Carlton Television . ‘There . is no reason why they cannot demote and ultimately remove sites hosting . large amounts of illegal material from search engine results.Google and . others already work with international law enforcement to block for . example child porn from search results, and it has provided no coherent, . responsible reason why it can’t do the same for illegal, pirated . content. Copyright infringement is a serious crime that threatens our economic future.’ The committee called for those guilty of online piracy to face up to ten years in prison, a five-fold increase on the two-year limit they currently face. A Google spokesman said: ‘We removed more than 20million links to pirated content from our search results in the last month alone. ‘But search is not the problem – according to Ofcom just 8 per cent of infringers in the UK use Google to find unlicensed films and 13 per cent to find unlicensed music. ‘Google works harder than anyone to help the film and music industry protect their content online.’ The company aims to remove pirated content from the web in less than six hours. In total, it received 57million notices from copyright owners and agents last year, demanding that it remove pirated content. The internet giant also changed its computer code last year to recognise sites which had legal action taken against them for copyright infringement.","Comments by Lord Younger emerged in a report published by the Committee for Culture, Media and Sport .

Discovery: Amanda Hutton, pictured outside court today, says she 'panicked' when she found her son Hamzah dead . The mother of a four-year-old boy found ‘mummified’ in her bedroom claimed he was a fussy eater who had starved himself, a court heard. Amanda Hutton told police Hamzah Khan ‘would refuse point blank to eat’. Hutton, 43, who denies manslaughter, is accused of starving her son to death and hiding his body for almost two years. He was found in a mummified state by police investigating the stench at her Bradford home. Hutton told police she had tried in vain to revive Hamzah on the day he died in December 2009. ‘I didn’t know what to do,’ she said. Hamzah was found in September 2011, wearing clothing for a child of nine months. Hutton continued to claim child benefit for her dead son, Bradford Crown Court heard. The trial continues. The court earlier heard Hutton told police she held her son Hamzah Khan after he starved to death - but did not tell the authorities about the tragedy because she felt 'numb' and was scared of doctors. The 43-year-old denies starving the boy, and said that she had repeatedly tried to make the four-year-old eat properly but he would only eat bananas and milk. A jury at Bradford Crown Court also heard yesterday how the police officer who found Hamzah's body in September 2011 started shaking and had to leave the room when he made the horrific discovery. Today the court heard transcripts from a series of police interviews with Hutton, from Bradford, when she was first arrested two years ago. She told detectives that Hamzah had always been unusually small and said that it was impossible to make him eat properly. 'He stopped eating even more over time,' she said. 'I was worried about him. I didn't know what to do about him. 'I was at my wit's end. He had really, really started to lose weight. I started to panic even more. Then he stopped eating altogether.' Hutton told officers that her son had fallen ill the day before he died, adding that she stayed up all night with him as he said: 'I love you mum. Are you alright mum?' In the morning she went to a supermarket intending to talk to a chemist about Hamzah, but her adult son Tariq phoned her while she was at the store, telling her that the four-year-old's eyes were rolling back into his head. She said she rushed home and gave the boy mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on a bed, adding: 'I just panicked. 'I held him for quite a long time. I put him in the cot until I could think about what to do.' Hutton added that she had tried massaging his heart for 10 minutes, saying that when that failed, 'I picked him up and cried.' After Hamzah's death, she said, 'I was completely, completely numb. As each day went by, I just found it harder and harder to do anything about it.' Scroll down for video . Dead: The four-year-old boy's body was left to 'mummify' for two years before it was recovered by police . Asked by interviewing officers why she did not seek medical assistance, Hutton said: 'I'm not a doctor person. I have a fear of doctors and things like that.' She said that after her son's death she had begun to drink up to a litre of vodka every day and allowed her house to fall into a squalid state. In one of the interviews, she said: 'He wasn't being starved, he would starve himself. He would not eat. He would refuse point blank to eat.' 'Ever since he's been born he's been fussy with eating. I just thought I could make him OK. I always worried about him. I worried about him from the day he was born.' Shocked: Sergeant Richard Dove told the court he started shaking when he found Hamzah's body . She added: 'He was never a very happy child. He was quite a miserable child - that was just the way he was.' Hutton admitted that in his last few months, Hamzah would mainly eat only bananas and milk, saying that although it was not a proper diet, 'It was all he would eat. At least it was something.' Hutton said she tried to feed him the nourishment drink Complan to build him up. Asked if it worked, she told detectives: 'Not really, otherwise he would be here wouldn't he?' The jury was told calls were made to Pizza Hut and the Spicy Delight takeaway in the hours after Hamzah's death. The court also heard Hutton continued to claim Hamzah's child benefit after his death. Earlier today, the policeman who found the boy's body told the court of his shock and disgust at discovering the corpse buried under layers of bedding, clothing and shoes. Acting Sergeant Richard Dove said: 'I believe I can deal with any situation. But my right hand started shaking. I had to grab my hand to calm myself down. So I went downstairs.' He said he made the discovery after going in to the bedroom for a second time, adding: 'I felt as though there was something wrong.' Sgt Dove said: 'There was like clothing and shoes and bedding piled up in the cot. I started to take shoes and bedding off and working my way down through the layers.' Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, asked the officer: 'What did you find?' Sgt Dove said: 'The body of a small child - Asian in origin.' He said the boy was wearing a white baby-gro and his head was tilted towards the right hand side. 'For a split second I thought, ""Is that real?"", doubting myself,' he added. The officer described to the court how skin from the child's face stuck to the final cover as he pulled it back. He said the face was 'mouldy' and 'to me, it was mummified'. Accused: Hutton, pictured at an earlier hearing, denies killing her son by starving him to death . Sgt Dove said he was struck by the right hand of the body. 'It was a bit like a stump, like a fibrous stump - dried out.' The officer told the court he was 'transfixed' at that point by what he saw and felt he had to leave the house. Sgt Dove also described the terrible state of the house before he made his grim discovery. He said there was a smell he said was 'rubbish mixed with sweat mixed with urine' and rubbish piled everywhere. The officer said he found beds soaked in urine but eventually became 'acclimatised' to the stench. Hamzah's father, Aftab Khan, has told the court he confronted his ex-partner about their son's care, and tried to get social services involved. The trial continues.
