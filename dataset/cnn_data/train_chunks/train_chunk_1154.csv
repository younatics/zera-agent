"Bed bug outbreaks have soared over the past six years, with overseas travellers blamed for the increase in infestations. London and the South East have been the hardest hit, with pest controllers reporting a 108 per cent increase in call-outs. Hotels and hostels are notorious hotspots and experts say Britons travelling to Asia and South America, as well as foreign visitors from those areas, have helped to spread the bugs. Bed bug outbreaks have soared over the past six years, with overseas travellers blamed for the increase in infestations . Pest control company Rentokil says the rise could in part be blamed on the 2008 financial crisis, which left hotels with smaller budgets to tackle pests. The problem has become so bad that Rentokil has launched a new service called ‘Bed Bug Monitor’ - an early detection programme for bed bug activity. The monitoring service uses a food-based lure which actively attracts bed bugs onto a sticky pad, providing an early warning of infestation. The lures are placed discreetly around the bedroom, such as under the bed or in suitcase storage areas where the creatures may have hitched a ride in baggge. The firm says the initiative will enable housekeeping staff to be the “first line of defence” in detecting an infestation. Bed bugs can lay 200 to 500 eggs over a two-month period, and are often difficult to spot - after hatching they take six to eight weeks to mature and they survive by feeding on blood . Spokesman Colm More said: ‘Contrary to popular belief, bed bugs are not a sign of poor hygiene – unfortunately, they’re a pest that can be inadvertently introduced anywhere which has a regular turnover of people and luggage. ‘The answer to preventing widespread infestations is early detection and dealing with an outbreak as soon as possible. ‘Bed bugs can pose serious risks to an organisation’s reputation and profitability and the longer you leave it, the more expensive it becomes to bring under control and eradicate.’ Bed bugs can lay 200 to 500 eggs over a two-month period, and are often difficult to spot. After hatching they take six to eight weeks to mature. Although the bugs survive by feeding on blood, they can go for a year without it.","Experts say Brits travelling to Asia and South America bring back the bugs .

"Just after 6pm most weekdays, Christian Nanetti counts his tips and rushes out the door of the new Soho eaterie Estado. Nanetti is a waiter now, blending into the London crowds as he heads for the Tube station to make his way out to Ashford, Kent, to train with his new club Dover Athletic. Four years ago Nanetti was an internet sensation, beating Raheem Sterling in Soccer AM’s iconic Skill Skool challenge in their battle over three rounds at QPR’s Harlington training centre. A young Raheem Sterling poses for the camera during Soccer AM's Skill Skool in 2010 . His QPR youth team-mate Christian Nanetti readies himself for action at Harlington training centre . Nanetti currently plays for Conference side Dover . The YouTube clip of their duel has attracted 384,000 views so far and watching it is like something out of the console game FIFA. Both were blessed with exceptional talent and yet they both ended up at very different ends of the football spectrum? This, then, is a cautionary tale. Nanetti’s good friend Raheem, now 19, is regarded as the brightest young talent in English football by Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers and the national team’s head coach Roy Hodgson. ‘If I text him, he more or less texts me back straight away,’ reveals Nanetti. ‘Before the World Cup, when he was about to play Italy I sent him a text to say I was supporting him, not my country. I meant it.’ Back in the day there was little to choose between the pair, both wingers and working hard at their game in QPR’s academy teams. ‘When we heard Sky were coming, there was always a good chance we could be chosen because we were two of the most skilful players at the club,’ revealed Nanetti. They learned their tricks by peeking over the fence to watch Adel Taarabt, then on loan from Tottenham, turn it on in first team training sessions. Sterling is now one of England's hottest talents at the age of just 19 having moved to Liverpool . Sterling (right) performs the tricks as his academy pals and Nanetti (left) look on . From there, they practised until the round the world trick that Sterling and Nanetti routinely perform in the Skill Skool became second nature. At 14, Sterling was so technically advanced that sometimes he was moved up a few levels to train with the first team. ‘He was that good,’ concedes Nanetti. Watching that Skill Skool clip, battled over three rounds, it appears that the world is at their feet as they perform clever tricks and flicks in front of their team-mates. Round by round they become more adventurous, encouraged by their team-mates and playing up to the camera crew. It’s good fun to watch. Sterling walks out at St George's Park ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifiers with San Marino and Estonia . Nanetti (left) is now a waiter and plays for Dover Athletic, while Sterling has nine England cap . Nanetti left his native Italy, where he was playing for a local side in Bologna, to sign a scholarship for QPR when he was 16. He was a clever player, but he couldn’t convince the coaches - Steve Brown, Steve Garland, Marc Bircham and Keith Ryan - to give him a professional contract at the end of his two-year spell at Loftus Road. By then, Sterling was on his way to Liverpool, but Nanetti couldn’t handle the rejection. The dream of making it professional was over. Nanetti eventually won the Skill Skool competition after three rounds, but lost his place at QPR's academy . Sterling and Nanetti were considered as the most skillful players in the QPR academy at that time . He was offered a short-term deal with Brighton, but he told them he wasn’t interested. ‘I lost my head, I was all over the place,’ Nanetti admits. ‘I didn’t do anything bad, nothing stupid, I come from a good family and my dad has always been there to guide me. ‘But I wanted to be a pro footballer, that’s all I wanted to do.’ When he went to Bradford City on trial for a week, he played well enough against Sheffield Wednesday in a practice match to be asked back for a second week. ‘I refused.’ He returned to Italy, to be with his family and friends for a few weeks while he worked it all out in his head. ‘I thought I was done with English football at first.’ In 2010, at the age of 18, he returned, playing for Raith Rovers in a Scottish FA Cup tie. He left, abruptly, when the club told him they couldn’t afford his wages. Liverpool's Sterling trains with Mario Balotelli, and has now created a superb platform on which to build . Nanetti is one of the most exciting players outside the Football League having forced his way back in . Then came the turning point, finding some focus in his football career for the first time since he was a happy-go-lucky teenager at QPR. He hooked up with Jamie Lawrence’s football academy in Wandsworth, south London, putting in the hours again and was backed by the former Bradford and Leicester midfielder. Few worked harder on the pitch than Lawrence in his day. Nanetti’s journey has taken him into non-League football, establishing himself as one of the most exciting players to watch outside the pro game. Since he knuckled down and worked at his game, he has played for Ashford Town in Middlesex, Lewes and Havant & Waterlooville before his summer move to Dover. Rodgers sees Sterling as England's hottest prospect, and his performances this year have been superb . VIDEO Sterling's a star anywhere in the world - Rodgers . Last week, when Sterling was in Basle preparing for a Champions League group game with Liverpool, Nanetti scored against Aldershot in a 3-0 victory at Crabble Stadium. ‘I still believe I can become a professional, why else would I spend six years away from my friends and family?’ He was in the squad on Tuesday night in the Vanarama Conference Premier, travelling to Nuneaton Borough as his new club attempt to move away from the relegation zone. To play on the same pitch as Sterling again seems fanciful, but Nanetti is determined to make it happen. If he does, the days of waiting on tables will be over.

"Standup comedian and former Saturday Night Live writer Hannibal Buress unleashed a violent tirade about Bill Cosby, calling him a 'rapist' and a sanctimonious hypocrite during a performance last week. 'Bill Cosby has the f***ing smuggest old black man public persona that I hate,' Buress declared from the stage Thursday night at the Trocadero Theater in Cosby's hometown of Philadelphia. Mocking America’s beloved dad from The Cosby Show, Buress said: '""Pull your pants up, black people. I was on TV in the '80s. I can talk down to you because I had a successful sitcom."" Yeah, but you raped women, Bill Cosby. So, brings you down a couple notches.' Scroll down for video . Comedy fight: Stand-up Hannibal Buress (left) hit out at Bill Cosby (right) during a performance, accusing him of being a rapist . No laughing matter: Buress delivered the rant dredging up past allegations against Cosby from the stage of the Trocadero Theater in Philadelphia . In his own words: Buress, 31, alluded to the controversy his performance had sparked on Twitter . 'I don't curse on stage. But yeah, you're a rapist,' Philadelphia Magazine reported. The 77-year-old Emmy - and Grammy-winning actor and comedian, who has been married for 50 years and has five children, has been battling accusations of sex assault for more than three decades. According to published reports, between the 1970s and early 2000s, as many as 13 women have come forward accusing Cosby of sexual assault. In 2006, the legendary comic, actor and activist reached a settlement with a woman who claimed that Cosby drugged and assaulted her at his home in a Philadelphia suburb, reported The Wrap. Cosby, however, has never been publicly accused of, or charged with, rape. Buress, 31, delivered his excoriating critique of Dr Cosby during the Philadelphia leg of his multi-city Comedy Camisado Tour. 'I want to just at least make it weird for you to watch Cosby Show reruns,' Buress said to the audience Thursday night. 'If you don't know about it, trust me. When you leave here, Google ""Bill Cosby rape."" That s*** has more results than Hannibal Buress.' America's favorite dad: Cosby, center, is best known for portraying Dr Heathcliff Huxtable, the patriarch of a middle-class New York family, on the long-running sitcom The Cosby Show . Cosby, best known for portraying the sweater-wearing, wise-cracking Dr Heathcliff Huxtable on the long-running Cosby Show, has become a polarizing figure in recent years for urging young black men to change their way of dress in order to be more successful in life. Cosby also has been critical of some of his fellow comedians, most famously Eddie Murphy, for using foul language in their routines. Hannibal Buress, a regular on Comedy Central’s Broad Street, appeared last year in the R-rated comedy Neighbors starring Zac Ephron and Seth Rogen. Earlier this month, he was cast as a voice actor in the upcoming animated feature Angry Birds based on the popular game. In August, it was revealed by Deadline that Bill Cosby was on the verge of signing a deal with NBC to develop a new family comedy starring the 77-year-old actor in a familiar role of a patriarch of a multi-generational clan. Not mincing words: Buress, a former SNL writer, described Cosby as a hypocrite for urging young black men to 'pull up their pants' and for criticizing fellow comedians for using foul language on stage . If all goes according to plan, the show will premiere sometime in the summer or fall of 2015. As of Tuesday evening, Dr Cosby has not responded to Hannibal Buress' rant accusing him of being a rapist. Buress, on his part, alluded to the controversy he had sparked on Twitter this morning, writing to his nearly 300,000 fans: 'Boy, that escalated quickly. I mean that really got out of hand fast.'","Buress, a former SNL writer and voice star of Angry Birds, brought up allegations of sexual assault against Cosby in his hometown of Philadelphia .

"Tory backbenchers have accused ‘teenage spin doctors’ in Downing Street of pressurising ministers to retract ‘truthful’ comments on immigration. It comes after Defence Secretary Michael Fallon was apparently slapped down for remarks he made on immigration during a TV interview. He said some communities felt ‘swamped’ and ‘under siege’ by European migrants. But hours after making the comments on Sunday he retracted them – seemingly following an intervention from Number 10. Defence secretary Michael Fallon (left) and skills minister Nick Boles (right) both retracted outspoken comments they made about immigration - something which has been criticised by Tory backbenchers . And on Tuesday, skills minister Nick Boles suggested that Britain would never have full control over its borders so long as we are a member of the EU. He also told Total Politics that Britons need to get used to the fact that there will be a ‘very large amount of immigration every year’. Later he also sent out a retraction, saying he did not believe the UK cannot seek to change the way immigration works within the Union. Downing Street sources insisted that the ministers had decided themselves to issue their own clarifications, but some Conservative backbenchers remained unconvinced. Stewart Jackson, MP for Peterborough, tweeted: ‘Fallon absolutely right to use the word “swamped” about “some” immigration hotspots despite what teenage spin doctors at No 10 might say.’ Yesterday, Mr Jackson said: ‘I think it was unfair on Michael Fallon because there are significant parts of the country where people are feeling what he said. ‘It was poor form to cut the legs from under him in hours over one word. He spoke the truth and it was unnecessary for them to exacerbate the situation by undermining him.’ He added: ‘The public don’t want to be told what the problem is – they want to be told the solution. ‘The reason the public is impatient on immigration is that they keep being told the problems but not the solutions. I think the solution is leaving the EU if we can’t get control of our borders back.’ Philip Davies, MP for Shipley, said: ‘What Nick Boles said wasn’t anything controversial – he was merely stating a fact. The Prime Minister knows that well – that’s why the immigration figures are so high. Why he has been slapped down for telling the truth is beyond me. ‘If Number 10 think these retractions will prove anything to the public, then they’re living in cloud cuckoo land.’ He added: ‘This has now happened to two ministers. After the debacle of making Michael Fallon issue a retraction after making sensible comments, you’d have thought they would have learned their lesson – but what happened to Nick Boles shows they haven’t.’ Several hours after Mr Fallon told Sky News that he believed some communities were ‘swamped’ by European migrants, a government ‘source’ sent round a quote saying: ‘He accepts he should have chosen his words better. He should have said under pressure.’ And Mr Boles’ retraction read: ‘I do not believe and did not say that we cannot seek changes to the way immigration works within the EU. Quite the contrary, I think it is essential that we do so.’","Defence Secretary Michael Fallon was reportedly slapped down remarks .

"Judging by Britain’s dismal Eurovision performance in recent years, we’ve been holding out for a hero. But fans hope all that could be about to change – after it was announced that Bonnie Tyler will be representing the UK in the song contest in May. Tyler, who is best known for 1980s hits such as Total Eclipse of the Heart, It’s a Heartache and Holding Out for a Hero, has described being chosen to perform for the country as ‘an honour’. Hope: Welsh-born singer Bonnie Tyler, pictured (left) this year and (right) in her 80s heyday, has been chosen to represent the UK at this year's Eurovision Song Contest . However, the 61-year-old will be hoping to fare better than the last veteran singer who represented the UK. Last year Engelbert Humperdinck was Britain’s entrant into the contest, held in Baku, Azerbaijan. Despite being one of the better-known names to represent the country in recent years, the 76-year-old finished in 25th place with only 12 points. Whether or not Tyler will achieve a better score in this year’s contest, held in Malmo, Sweden, remains to be seen. It is widely believed  that many countries vote for each other for ‘political’ reasons rather than for the quality of their songs. The Welsh-born singer will be performing a track called Believe in Me, written for her by Desmond Child. Honoured: The 61-year-old singer described being chosen as 'an honour' He has previously penned hits for chart toppers including Bon Jovi, Robbie Williams and Aerosmith. Tyler, whose husky voice has led to her being described as ‘the female Rod Stewart’, said: ‘It is an honour to represent my country and is also a wonderful way to ensure that my song Believe in Me reaches the widest possible audience. ‘It is a very strong, catchy and melodic song that appeals to a wide range of people. Desmond Child partially wrote this song at the dinner table at his house in Nashville whilst we were all eating together.’ Tyler, who was born Gaynor Hopkins, credits her remarkably youthful looks to Botox injections, which she has had twice a year for 15 years. Disappointing: Engelbert Humperdinck was Britain's entrant into the contest, held in Baku, Azerbaijan, but finished in 25th place with only 12 points . Last year she also showed off her slimmer figure after losing more than a stone and half in three months. And despite her last big hit in the UK being almost 30 years ago, Tyler has enjoyed continued success on the continent and hopes this will help her in the competition. She said: ‘I do believe that God blessed me in life with a wonderful family, a successful career and a loving marriage, and remain thankful for that blessing.’ Describing almost four decades of marriage to property developer Robert Sullivan, she added: ‘It’s simple, we still love each other.’","Total Eclipse of the Heart singer described being chosen as 'an honour'

"From clouds dancing across the Milky Way to a stunning solar eclipse over Kenya, the annual competition showcasing the mysterious depths of our universe has revealed some incredible images. West Midlands-based photographer James Woodend beat over a thousand amateur and professional photographers from around the world to win the title of Astronomy Photographer of the Year 2014. As well as securing the £1,500 ($2,440) top prize, his image takes pride of place in the exhibition of winning photographs opening today at the Royal Observatory Greenwich. Scroll down for video . The winning image by James Woodend was of a green aurora pictured in Iceland's Vatnajokull National Park. The light reflected almost symetrically in Jokulsrlon Glacier lagoon. A complete lack of wind and currrent combine in this sheltered lagoon scene to create an arresting mirror effect giving the image a sensation of utter stillness . The judges were mesmerised by Woodend's shot portraying a vivid green aurora dancing across the Icelandic night sky and reflected symmetrically in the glacial Jökulsarlon lagoon of Vatnajökull National Park. Competition judge and Royal Observatory Public Astronomer, Dr Marek Kukula said: 'I love the combination of whites and blue in the glacier with the chilly green of the aurora in this wonderfully icy picture. 'We've had some amazing aurora pictures in the competition over the last six years, but this is the first time a photo of the Northern Lights has actually won the Astronomy Photographer of the Year prize. 'We were all completely in awe of the colours and symmetry of James' shot.' Highly commended images in the other categories and special prizes include a breathtaking view of the Earth taken from the brink of space, with the help of a high altitude balloon launched from Boulder, Colorado by Patrick Cullis. The Horsehead Nebula is one of the most photographed objects in the night sky, but this image portrays it in a brand new light. The photographer draws the eye down to the creased and folded landscape of gas and dust at its base rather than focusing solely on the silhouette of the horsehead itself.  Bill Snyder also includes the glowing cavity surrounding a bright star situated to the lower left of the horsehead . Rock formation in the Wairarapa district of New Zealand create a stark foreground and  contrast to the dusty clouds dancing acorss the Milky Way. No light pollution and a clear, crisp night afford the photographer a fantastic opportunity for this superb image . IC 1340 is part of the Veil Nebula, a supernova remnant in constellation Cygnus at distance of about 1470 light years.  The shock front formed by the material ejected from giant explosion, the super nova, can be seen in this image. The image was taken by J.P. Metsävainio in Finland . In 2012, O Chul Kwon succeeded in his goal of photographing a Venus- Lunar Occulation with this stunning time-lapse image over Mount Hamkaek in South Korea; an ambition he had held since seeing the phenomenon in 1989. The photograph shows us what happens when the moon and Venus appear the occupy the same position in the sky. Venus becomes temporarly hiddend by the moon, only to re-emerge in less than an hour . Astronomy Photographer of the Year is run by the Royal Observatory Greenwich and BBC Sky at Night Magazine. Now in its sixth year, the competition received a record number of over 2500 entries from 51 countries. The best of these exceptional photographs are showcased in a free exhibition in the Royal Observatory's Astronomy Centre which is open to the public from 18 September 2014 until 22 February 2015. Another image shows the snaking swirls of super-heated gas on the boiling surface of the sun captured by Alexandra Hart. Judges were also impressive by a figure silhouetted against the backdrop of a Kenyan savannah skyline and a rarely seen hybrid solar eclipse, taken by Eugen Kamenew from Germany. A stark yet opulent portrayal of the rock formations of the Wairarapa district in New Zealand, contrasting with the dusty clouds dancing across the Milky Way photographed by Chris Murphy won Sir Patrick Moore prize for Best Newcomer. The entrants in the Young Astronomy Photographer of the Year category impressed the judges again this year, with 15 year old twins Shishir and Shashank Dholakia from the US being crowned winners. Their image showed the Horsehead Nebula standing out against the red glow of the background emission nebula, 1500 light-years from Earth. 'This year two things stood out for me while judging: the record-breaking number of 2,500 entries from a truly global community of astrophotographers, and the staggering quality of the images,' said BBC Sky at Night Magazine's Editor Chris Bramley, who is a judge for the competition, said of this year's contest. 'It was regularly hard to believe that many were taken from the surface of the Earth and not a space telescope orbiting our planet.'

The sun's boiling surface curves away beneath us in this evocative shot that conveys the scale and violence of our star. The region of solar activity on the left could engulf the Earth several times over with room to spare. The sun's outer layers behave as a fluid, as alluded to in the image's title, and are constantly twisted . The zodiacal light seems to rise from the horizon like a pyramid with the brilliant point of Venus at its apex. Comprised of sunlight scattered and diffused by tiny grains of dust that drift between the planets, this pale feature marks out the plane of the solar system. The stillness of the skies contrasts with the transience of the scene below, with its shifting human figures reflected in the temporary waters of Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre . Resembling a giant eye looking across 700 light years of space, the Helix Nebula is one of the closest planetary nebula to Earth. The image reveals intricate details in the glowing gas that comprises the nebula including the tadpole-like 'cometary knots' that appear to stream from the inner edge of the gaseous ring . Poised on the brink of space, this astonishing shot shows the curvature of the Earth with the towering Rocky Mountains reduced to tiny wrinkles on the surface below. Taken with the aid of a high altitude balloon, launched from Boulder, Colorado, the photographer captures the breath-taking view of the Earth. The tiny dot of the moon pictured in the distance highlights the vast expanse between our planet and its nearest cosmic neighbour . The image on the left was taken in Australia near the town of Bungendore. It captures the Capital Wind Farm on the shore of Lake George. On the right is view of one of nature's greatest spectacles, a total solar eclipse, taken from an airplane above Turkana Kenya . This image is centred on NGC 1999, an area situated below Orion’s Belt and oft overlooked due to its proximity to a number of popular targets in one of the richest constellations of the sky. The photograph serves to remind us that there is often much more happening in our galaxy than meets the eye and that the space between the stars is rarely empty. The scatter of the bright blue stars illuminates the billowing dust and gas clouds dancing across the image .","Overall winner was photographer James Woodend who took an image of aurora in Iceland's Vatnajokull Park .

"Brighton have been hit with a £90,000 fine by the Football Association and warned over their future conduct for admitting breaches of the governing body's agent regulations. The charges relate to the Seagulls' acquisition of midfielder Dale Stephens from fellow Sky Bet Championship side Charlton at the end of January 2014. Three authorised agents have also been sanctioned and warned to their future conduct for their roles in the same case. Brighton have been punished by the FA after breaching agent regulations during a transfer last year . Dale Stephens joined Brighton in January 2014 . In explaining the decisions, the regulatory commission decreed Brighton had 'in the events which have happened, benefited from the non-payment of most of the commission'. It was revealed the south-coast club were charged under rule C.2, which states that a club 'must not so arrange matters as to conceal or misrepresent the reality and/or substance of any matters in relation to a transaction or contract negotiations' They were also charged under rule F.1, which states 'an authorised agent, club and player shall ensure that the name, signature and licence or registration number of each and every authorised agent or exempt solicitor carrying out any agency activity in relation to a transaction or contract negotiation (whether directly or indirectly) is shown on all relevant contracts and documents as is required from time to time.' Stephens, 25, has played 18 times for the Seagulls, with only four appearances coming this season. Agents Alex Levack and Matthew Kleinman have been fined £7,500 and banned from all agency activity and intermediary activity for 14 months, with half of that suspended. Ali Rahnama has been suspended from all agency activity and intermediary activity for a period of nine months, with six months suspended.","Brighton & Hove Albion admitted breaches of FA's agent regulations .

She said: 'There are no words to explain the way . I felt. The tiredness was like no other. I lost my job as a teaching assistant and the ability . to care for my family. My husband Nigel had to become my carer, helping . me get out of bed, get dressed, eat and do all the things I used to do . on my own. 'I had always done the cooking; cleaning and taking care of the family, but my illness meant I couldn't do that anymore.' As time went on the family's diet started to change and takeaways and processed food fast became the norm. Self-esteem boost: Hannah had less confidence when she was a size 16, left, but now she's a slim size 12 . Nigel, a train driver and also a crew . manager for North Yorkshire fire and rescue service, said: 'It was . easier for me to grab a takeaway on the way home from . work, but the more often this happened the more the whole family relied . on quick fix takeaways and snacks to keep them going.' Samantha's weight rose to 14 stone 6lbs, dress size 20, while Nigel was 23 stone 9lb. Meanwhile, their daughters Hannah and Katie weighed 13 stone 2lbs and 14 stone respectively and were dress sizes 16-18. Hannah, who is studying a business degree, admitted her diet was 'dreadful'. She said: 'I would always skip . breakfast, not eat much during the day then eat badly in the evenings.' Media apprentice Katie's eating habits were similar. She said: 'I . did the same thing. Rarely having breakfast and skipping lunch left me . starving in the evening and I'd end up eating into the late hours. I'd . snack as well, eating chocolate, crisps, chips, pasta and cereal. I . hated exercise and spent most of my time in front of the television when . I wasn't at college.' Happier: Katie, pictured before dieting left, said she loves being able to shop for smaller clothes now she dropped two dress sizes, right . The sisters said their weight affected their confidence and happiness. Hannah said: 'I . would also skip nights out with friends. The truth is when you hate . yourself so much; you struggle with social situations and your lack of . confidence makes you just want to hide away.' Katie agreed: 'Because I was overweight, I didn't . want to go out with my friends, they were all skinnier than me and I . felt uncomfortable around them. I didn't feel good in anything I wore, I . felt very unhappy.' The turning point came when Nigel was told his obesity could send him to an early grave. He explains: 'Our weight and . waistlines obviously increased, but that wasn't the only thing. I . started to suffer with general aches and pains and was experiencing . headaches and heartburn. It actually turned out to be much more serious . than that and my GP told me that I was at high risk of having a heart . attack if I didn't change my diet and lifestyle.' Samantha said they knew they had to do something to change their ways. 'I hated seeing my girls sad and not . wanting to go out and enjoy themselves and certainly didn't want Nigel . having a heart attack', she said. Concerned about her father's health after his warning from his GP, Hannah called a family meeting where they all agreed to stick to a diet programme. Nigel has whittled his waist from 48 to 44 inches and said it was all thanks to the family working together to achieve their goal . Hannah had heard about the 'Body by Vi Challenge' from a friend and the family decided to try it. Nigel was initially reluctant but agreed to give it a go. He said: 'When the girls came . home and told me all about Body by Vi Challenge, I was a little skeptical. I hate . diets and all the fuss and organising you have to do. Plus with my work . patterns nothing seemed to actually work. I either ate too much or not . enough. 'As a . dutiful husband I listened and a lot of what Samantha said . began to appeal. I was very overweight and my health was suffering and I . agreed to join the Challenge.' The family started with the 90 day challenge that involves replacing two meals a day with Vi-Shape shakes, only having filling snacks from their range and a home made low fat meal in the evening. After three months sticking to the programme, Samantha has lost 2st 1lb, Nigel 3st 9lb, Hannah 2st 2lb and Katie 2st 3lb. Samantha, who now weighs 12st 5lbs and has dropped to a dress size 16, said they all feel better for the diet. She said: 'But the biggest thing for me personally is how I . feel and how it's improved my health. 'Almost instantly I began to feel . more energised not just physically but mentally. I feel more alert and . as the pounds began to melt away I started to feel more confident and . positive.' Nigel, who now weighs 20 stone and has whittled his waist from 48 to 44 inches, said doing the challenge together made all the difference. He said: 'Doing the challenge as a family has . been great. We have encouraged and supported each other through the . highs and lows. We are all on the same wavelength.' Samantha, pictured side on before, left, and after the family diet said: 'Our weight-loss has given us all new found confidence' Samantha Before: 14st 6lbs, dress size 20After: 12st 5lbs, dress size 16NigelBefore: 23st 9lbAfter: 20stHannahBefore: 13st 2lbs, dress size 16After: 11st 2lbs, dress size 12KatieBefore: 14st, dress size 18After: 11st 11lbs, dress size 14 . Total weightloss: 9st 13lb . He added: 'I feel so much better. All the symptoms I was suffering have eased tremendously; I can even tie my shoe laces again.' Hannah, now 11st 2lbs, dress size 12, and Katie, 11st 11lbs, dress size 14, said they feel so much more confident after slimming down. Katie said: 'I'm enjoying shopping . for smaller clothes and beginning to like what I see in the mirror, . even my skin and my hair look and feel healthier. It's so nice when . people give me compliments.' The family are now determined to stick to their new lifestyle by maintaining a healthy diet and exercising by joining a gym. Samantha explained: 'We all are a lot more thoughtful as to what we eat. We do have treats but actually our food is so much better. We still eat well but healthier versions of previous meals. A family favourite is fajitas – the chicken is baked with no fat and the vegetables are roasted with a spray of low cal fry light. We have a tortilla each or Hannah and I like to use romaine lettuce as a wrap for a healthier choice. Then top with salsa or I make a low cal yoghurt dressing with chopped mint. 'We also make curries from scratch instead of a sauce from a jar. And we have brown rice instead of white and we portion control our meals. 'We don't add fat to food, we roast , bake or grill the meat, the same with vegetables. If we have a sauce it's tomato based as they are less fattening. 'We've cut out bread and have very few potatoes but as a treat we still have our roast dinners. We've found just making these small changes have helped.' Vi Challenge were so impressed with their combined weightloss of 9st 13Ib they named them winners of the family weightloss competition. Samantha said they were delighted by the recognition but added: 'The best prize of all is having my family back to the way we used to be.

"From just six-months old, Ben Evison has suffered from a muscle-wasting condition that has stopped him from playing with other children, . The schoolboy, now seven, has struggled to make friends as a result of the devastating illness. But his life has been turned around after being introduced to the perfect companion - a 12-week-old support dog called Rosie. Best friends: Ben Evison, who has spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1, has formed an inseparable bond with his support dog Rosie . Turn around: The seven-year-old schoolboy has struggled to make friends at school because of his debilitating condition . Ben from Whitchurch, Shropshire, was told he had spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1, or SMARD1 in February this year and is believed to affect just eight people around the world. The genetic mutation leaves Ben unable to eat, sleep or play like normal children as it affects his respiratory system. But everyday tasks he finds difficult have been made easier by the chocolate Labrador, who has helped aid him in his treatment. The animal is now being trained to help Ben get dressed, pick things up and will also be able to monitor his breathing. And after meeting adorable, the pair have formed an inseparable relationship as she aids Ben with everyday tasks and has already had a life-changing impact. His mother Catherine, 39, a part-time administrator, said: 'Although Ben goes to mainstream school, he struggles to make friends with the kids there. 'Now he has Rosie it means the world to him. Not only will she be trained to help him get dressed and monitor him, but she'll also be his best friend. 'The condition is extremely rare, and Ben has a different form that no-one else in the world is listed as having. Diagnosis: Ben first developed symptoms of the condition when he was just six months old, but it was first mistaken for club foot and then for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease . Family support: Ben's mother Catherine and his father Paul were determined to get a dog to help Ben . 'We just don't know what the future holds for Ben. As parents it's very scary but we take each day as it comes. 'Doctors have told us to carry on as normal and obviously that can be difficult, but Ben is so determined to live so we will carry on as best as we can and Rosie will help with that.' Ben first developed symptoms of the condition when he was just six months old, but it was first mistaken for club foot and then for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. It was not until just a few weeks ago that Catherine and Paul finally got the correct diagnosis. SMARD1 is caused by a genetic mutation. It attacks the respiratory system and children with the condition rarely live past two years old. Catherine said: 'When we thought it was CMT it was bearable because at least we knew what to expect and it is not life threatening. 'The diagnosis of SMARD1 completely turned us upside down. Health: Ben is underweight because of his condition, and has a feeding tube and pump at night time . 'By rights he should not be here, he shouldn't have survived past two years old. 'Doctors think the only reason he has done is because of his sheer stubbornness to live.' Ben is underweight because of his condition, and has a feeding tube and pump at night time. He has splints on his legs and struggles with walking, but he now has little Rosie his life has been transformed. Care support worker Paul, 47, said: 'Me and Catherine get up in the night to check he is still breathing. He has a feeding tube and although he is still underweight the tube keeps him stable. 'We go into his room and his breathing is so quiet that we can't help but check that he is okay. 'Once trained, Rosie will be able to help monitor Ben's breathing in the night, as well as helping him get changed and go out.' Unfortunately, charities were unable to supply Ben with a support dog either because he is outside the catchment area or because Ben is too young. Expensive: Rosie's training is costing the family £31 an hour so they have started fundraising to cover the costs . But Catherine and Paul were determined to get a dog to help Ben. Catherine said: 'You can see the difference in him already. 'Ben has a brother Luke, nine, and a sister Bethany, six, who also love having Rosie around. 'They don't treat Ben any differently. They help him, but to them he is just a brother. It's really lovely. 'Rosie will help Ben get some independence as he gets older. 'The charities said they couldn't give him a dog until he was 15, as that's when he'd start going out on his own, but we don't even know if he'll still be here then so we wanted to act now.' Rosie's training is costing the family £31 an hour so they have started fundraising to cover the costs. Paul said: 'It's not that charities won't help us, they have said they will assist in any way they can. 'We had to buy Rosie and I asked my boss for more hours because of the cost of training her. 'Ben suggested we do some fundraising so we are going to do a car wash and he also wants to do a raffle. Wait: The family have said charities would not give Ben a dog until he was 15 . 'We would be so grateful for any money that we raise, Ben is so full of determination so we are just keeping positive for him and taking it one day at a time.' A spokesman for specialist genetic research centre GeneticEx said: 'SMARD1 appears to be a rare condition, but its prevalence is unknown. 'There are just 60 cases reported in the history of scientific literature, with estimates as low as under ten sufferers currently living. 'It is an inherited condition that causes muscle weakness and respiratory failure typically beginning in infancy. 'Normally, the diaphragm contracts and moves downward during inhalation to allow the lungs to expand. 'With diaphragm paralysis, affected individuals require life-long support with a machine to help them breathe (mechanical ventilation). 'It is common that sufferers do not reach the later stages of childhood.' To donate to Ben and Rosie.

"Jordan Henderson and Amir Khan met up for an interview this week - in which the Liverpool vice-captain told the champion boxer that he wants his own rumble with Diego Costa. Henderson clashed with the Chelsea striker  during a Capital One Cup semi-final last month as the two players stared each other down at Anfield. And the 24-year-old told Khan in an interview which ranged from dietary habits to favourite stadiums, that Costa was the man who he would most like to beat in a 50/50 tackle.

Khan and Henderson chat in the ring as duo spoke about several topics, from football to food . When asked the question by Bolton-born fighter Khan in the MaxiNutrition feature, Henderson laughed and replied:  'At the minute Diego Costa, we had a little tiff the other day so it would probably be him.' The England international also revealed that Reds captain Steven Gerrard was his idol as he came through the youth ranks at Sunderland before his £16m switch to Anfield back in 2011. ‘It’s hard to say who my sporting hero is because I play with him every week, but obviously Gerrard was one of my idols.’ added Henderson. ‘[Playing with him] was a bit strange at first, and going to meet him in training for the first time, but he’s just a normal guy.’ During the interview, Henderson was also captured practicing free-kicks with Khan. And it's fair to say the boxer should focus his energy on earning a fight with Floyd Mayweather Jr. Khan tries his hand at some free-kicks - but may want to stick to the day job .

"The SFA on Wednesday took the unprecedented step of announcing they are to appeal the decision to hit Rangers goalkeeper Steve Simonsen with only a one-match ban for betting on matches. Hampden compliance officer Tony McGlennan made the surprise move after deciding the suspension — which included a one-match suspended ban — was ‘unduly lenient’. And, as the appeal was announced, former Hampden compliance officer Vincent Lunny called the punishment ‘light’, insisting tough sanctions against footballers who gamble were necessary to help stave off the rising threat of match-fixing. However, Simonsen’s legal team believe the original sentence was fair, given the keeper gambled just £202 over a 12-month period on a total of 55 matches. Rangers goalkeeper Steve SImonsen was handed a one match ban for breaching betting rules . The Englishman’s modest bets were mainly placed on games played in England and Europe. He bet only once on a Scottish match — a Premiership fixture — and never on games involving his own team. The 35-year-old former Everton, Stoke and Sheffield United keeper argued in front of the SFA- convened independent judicial panel earlier this month that he believed Scottish football followed the same rules as the FA down south when he moved north of the border in 2013. In England, players were forbidden from betting on matches involving their own teams and on competitions in which they feature. The FA have since updated their rulebook to follow the Scottish FA’s own zero- tolerance approach, which outlaws betting on any professional football game in the world. The SFA believe the ban handed out by an independent judicial panel is too lenient and will appeal against it . The one-match ban handed down on February 12 saw Simonsen sit out of a 2-0 home defeat against Championship rivals Hibs at Ibrox 24 hours later. This is the first time since the right of appeal on judicial panel judgments was introduced at the start of this season that the SFA have exercised their option to challenge a verdict. The appeal date has yet to be set. Last night an SFA statement read: ‘The SFA can confirm that the compliance officer has appealed against the sanction imposed on Steve Simonsen. ‘An appellate tribunal will convene in due course to consider the appeal on the basis that the sanction imposed was unduly lenient.’ Ironically for Rangers, a key driving force behind the SFA pushing to introduce the power of appeal in judicial panel cases was the sentence handed out to Ibrox midfielder Ian Black. Simonsen gambled just £202 over a 12-month period on a total of 55 matches mostly in England and Europe . In September 2013, Black was banned for 10 games — with seven of those suspended until the end of that season — and fined £7,500 after admitting betting on 160 matches over a seven-year period, including, crucially, laying three wagers against his own club winning. In another case last year, Michael Moffat of Ayr United, was last year given a four-game ban — with two suspended — after placing 150 bets, including seven bets on six matches involving his own team. Last night Lunny told BBC Sportsound: ‘Taking a tough stance now is the way to stop that (match-fixing) coming into the game. ‘For Simonsen to miss one match is perhaps light when you consider what else gets you a one-match ban, for example two yellow cards.’","Steve Simonsen was banned for one game for betting on football matches .

"Kenny McDowall has urged Rangers supporters not to let the club down again — with police set to enforce a ‘zero-tolerance’ approach to criminal behaviour when the Ibrox side play at Falkirk on Friday night. Elements of the club’s fanbase have come under fire after a re-emergence of sectarian singing at the recent League Cup semi-final with Celtic and at last Friday’s Championship game with Raith Rovers in Kirkcaldy. The SPFL announced on Wednesday that they are to examine their rules covering such matters, with the absence of ‘strict liability’ allowing fans to shame their clubs with impunity. Rangers supporters engaged in sectarian songs during the recent cup defeat by rivals Celtic . Rangers reacted with condemnation to the singing of ‘inappropriate’ songs, telling fans attending Friday's match that additional police resources will be on site to ensure there is no repeat of the recent embarrassments. Falkirk have also pledged support to Police Scotland in their bid to tackle the problem and revealed a rigorous search regime will be in force at all turnstiles, with a ‘zero-tolerance approach to anyone who is intoxicated’ also in place. But McDowall is hopeful that Friday’s game passes without fresh controversy. ‘The club does not condone that kind of behaviour at all — and we’ve issued a statement on it,’ he said. ‘We’re very hopeful there will be no incidents at the Falkirk game. ‘I think there has been enough said this week. But it is not just our club.’ Police have warned they will be enforcing a zero tolerance approach to criminal behaviour at Falkirk match . Manager Kenny McDowall has urged Rangers supporters not to let the club down again . The SFA have also pledged to help the SPFL lay down more robust regulations to help tackle inappropriate behaviour at matches. President Campbell Ogilvie said: ‘The Scottish FA welcomes yesterday’s statement from the SPFL confirming regulations regarding supporter misconduct will be reviewed and discussed next month. ‘It is important that the game takes a collective stance against the kind of unacceptable behaviour that depicts Scottish football in a negative light. ‘While jurisdiction for league competitions rests with the SPFL, the Scottish FA is happy to assist in the creation of more robust regulations.’ Meanwhile, McDowall hit out at the SFA decision to appeal against Steve Simonsen’s one-match ban for betting on football matches. Club have warned their fans about the police approach for Friday's game with Falkirk . The 35-year-old gambled just £202 over a 12-month period on a total of 55 matches, mainly in England and Europe.

The one-match ban — with another match suspended — handed down by the judicial panel on February 12 saw Simonsen sit out a 2-0 home loss to Hibs at Ibrox 24 hours later. Now he faces a sweat to see if he will miss further matches after the unprecedented decision to appeal by the SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan. McDowall said: ‘I just find it unbelievable that someone from the SFA can bring it back up again after they have appointed a panel who have made a decision on it. ‘Now (the compliance officer) isn’t happy with that decision.

"Plea deal: Jared Loughner is expected to plead guilty to the 2011 shooting that left six people dead and 13 others injured . Jared Lee Loughner is expected to plead guilty on Tuesday in the 2011 shooting attack that left six people dead and 13 others, including Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, injured in Tucson, Arizona, according to  sources familiar with the case. During the hearing, a court-appointed psychiatrist will testify that despite drastic swings in his mental capacity, Loughner, 23, is competent to enter a plea at this time as he comprehends what happened and acknowledges the gravity of the charges. The source, speaking on condition of anonymity about upcoming events in the criminal case, said the plan is for Loughner to enter a guilty plea in the murders and attempted murders that would result in a sentence of life imprisonment. The plan is contingent on the judge in the case allowing Loughner to enter the plea. Loughner pleaded not guilty to 49 charges stemming from the January 8, 2011, shooting rampage outside a Tucson supermarket where Giffords was meeting with constituents. Authorities said he shot Giffords, opened fire on the crowd and was subdued by bystanders. Giffords was struck in the head and subsequently left Congress to devote her time to rehabilitation. An Arizona college that Loughner attended released numerous emails about him that painted a picture of a struggling student with emotional problems who disturbed others with his strange behavior. U.S. District Judge Larry Burns had ruled that Loughner isn't psychologically fit to stand trial, but that he could eventually be made ready for trial after treatment. Experts had concluded that Loughner suffers from schizophrenia. Allegations: Prosecutors said Loughner, left, had a plan to kill then-Congresswoman Giffords, right, during a meeting with constituents in Tuscon . Prison officials in Missouri, where Loughner has been held, have forcibly medicated him with psychotropic drugs to make him fit to stand trial. Even though psychologists have said Loughner's condition is improving, his lawyers have vigorously fought the government's efforts to medicate him. At one point, a federal appeals court halted the forced medication, but resumed it once mental health experts at the prison concluded that Loughner's condition was deteriorating further. Loughner has demonstrated bizarre behavior since his arrest. He was removed from a May 25, 2011, court hearing when he lowered his head to within inches of the courtroom table, then lifted his head and began a loud and angry rant. His psychologist has said that since . Loughner has been forcibly medicated, his condition has improved. He sat . still and expressionless for seven hours at a hearing in September . 2011. The terms of the plea . deal remained vague Saturday on whether Loughner would admit guilt to . all or some of the charges rather than face trial and face a potential . death penalty verdict. Innocent victims: Christina-Taylor Green, 9, right, and U.S. District Judge John M. Roll, left, were among the six people killed in the attack . Capital punishment initially was within the realm of possibility when federal prosecutors obtained a grand jury indictment against Loughner, and they announced the case as one with ‘potential death penalty charges,’ the Los Angeles Times reported. According to the indictment, a search of Loughner’s home yielded a letter stashed in a safe in which Giffords thanked him for attending an earlier Congress On Your Corner event. Also in the safe was an envelope with handwriting that said, ‘I planned ahead’ and ‘My assassination’ and Giffords’ name, ‘along with what appears to be Loughner’s signature,’ the indictment said. Prosecutors pointed to that as evidence that Loughner coldly calculated the attack. But shortly after his arrest, the 23-year-old’s mental fitness to stand trial has been called into question by his defense team. Courage: The 41-year-old has resigned her Arizona seat to concentrate on recovering from her injuries after she was shot in the head in January last year . His friends said he consumed alcohol and occasionally smoked marijuana;  while attending a local community college, he videotaped a rant in September of 2010 on the campus in which he screamed that the school was not following the U.S. Constitution. According to the indictment, Loughner bought the Glock used in the shooting from a Tucson vendor in November of 2010 and the ammunition at a Wal-Mart store on the morning of the incident. He took a taxi to the Safeway supermarket  where Giffords was holding her constituent meeting. Among those killed were 9-year-old Christina-Taylor Green and U.S. District Judge John M. Roll, the presiding federal judge in Tucson. While he was in jail, more details came out about Loughner’s  troubled mental state. In July 2011, a prison doctor reported that the 23-year-old was depressed and was insisting that ‘the radio was talking to him and inserting thoughts into his mind.’ Saved: Mrs Giffords, in a red jacket and with a compress pressed to her head, is rushed to hospital last year. Doctors say her swift arrival at the hospital may have saved her life . He was placed under suicide watch and often paced in circles about his cell, according to court records and pretrial testimony. He screamed and cried. He remained convinced that Giffords was dead, and became angry when told she survived. When he was told at one point that he might face the death penalty, Loughner wept for nearly an hour. ‘I want to die,’ he said. ‘Give me the injection now. Kill me now.’ During a hearing last May, federal marshals forcibly removed Loughner from the courtroom after he began shouting  incoherently about ‘kill free’ or ‘kill shot.’ Then he yelled, ‘She died in front of me!’","Jared Loughner, 23, is accused of shooting six people dead and injuring 13 .

"A Mickey Mouse loving couple visited a total of three Disney theme parks in one day, taking them on an incredible whistle stop tour of the globe. Michael, 49, and Diane Greening, 51, from San Diego, spent 28 hours travelling  7,900-miles to Tokyo, California and Orlando. Beginning at 9.50am in Tokyo Disneyland, the pair, who celebrate their wedding anniversary at the theme park every year, managed a quick snap in front of Sleeping Beauty castle, then boarded a 10-hour flight to Los Angeles. Michael and Diane Greening spent 28 hours travelling 7,900-miles to Tokyo, California and Orlando . They had struggled to decide between visiting Tokyo Disneyland and Walt Disney World, in Florida, so they chose to do both - stopping at Disneyland, in California, in between. The mission could only be accomplished on days when the Magic Kingdom in Orlando was open until midnight. And even though they arrived in Florida an hour later than expected, the Greenings reached Disneyland just after noon, posed for a picture and raced to Orange County's John Wayne Airport. But tension mounted when they missed their flight to Florida and the pair thought they'd never make it in time to see all three parks. Thankfully they were ushered onto the next available flight and made it to Disney World, Florida at 11.40pm - just twenty minutes before their deadline.

The club's website released a statement confirming both arrests occurred during the match at the Amex Stadium,with the racist chanting suspected to be from a Seagulls fan. While the smoke bomb was allegedly thrown by an away fan during Birmingham's defeat to Chris Hughton's side, which moved the Seagulls three points clear of relegation. Inigo Calderon celebrates his second during a crucial 4-3 win over Birmingham in the Championship . 'Brighton & Hove Albion can confirm two arrests were made at yesterday's match against Birmingham City: one on suspicion of use of racist language, in relation to an historic offence; and one for throwing a smoke bomb onto the pitch from the away end,' said the club's statement. 'The arrest on suspicion of use of racist language was made after a complaint and subsequent statement was made to the club on Saturday morning that racist language was used prior to a previous home match, by an individual watching a televised match in the stadium concourse. 'The suspect was identified by the club's CCTV staff and stewards, before being ejected from the stadium and handed over to Sussex Police. Calderon scored in the 85th minute to confirm the vital three points for Chris Hughton's side . Clayton Donaldson runs off in celebration having equalised early in the first-half at the Amex Stadium . 'The club has a zero tolerance approach on all forms of discrimination and fans found guilty of such offences at home matches, away matches, when travelling to and from our fixtures or any club event, can expect a lengthy or indefinite ban from all Albion fixtures. Chief executive Paul Barber had his say on the matter: 'We pride ourselves on welcoming everyone at Brighton & Hove Albion and we simply will not tolerate any kind of xenophobic behaviour. 'We expect our fans to conduct themselves in a manner befitting to our club - and I am pleased that the vast majority are a credit to us,' added Barber.

'I applaud the supporter who came forward to report the incident, and would encourage any fan witnessing this type of behaviour to do likewise. Supporters can rest assured their information will be treated with the utmost discretion, that we will fully investigate all complaints of this nature and we will act accordingly. 'I also applaud our safety and stewarding team for the swift actions, following yesterday's complaint, in identifying the suspected individual; they will continue to assist Sussex Police in their investigation.'

"It is July 23. Liverpool have just played the first game of their North American tour in Boston and Brendan Rodgers is fulfilling his media duties. Less than 48 hours earlier, Steven Gerrard had revealed that he was retiring from international football. After 114 caps he felt he owed it to Liverpool to give them his undivided attention. So Rodgers was asked how he saw Gerrard’s future. ‘I am very happy that Steven is going to commit to Liverpool and I am sure that (his contract) is something we will look at,’ said Rodgers. ‘I know he can continue to play beyond this season. I have always said that. Steven Gerrard is a Liverpool legend and he deserves to be offered a new contract at Anfield soon . The midfielder's contract is up at the end of the season and he can speak to foreign clubs from January 1 . ‘Now he doesn’t have international football, he will have that freshness. I am sure he will want it sorted out. You never want to leave players with not too long to go on their contracts.’ The esteem in which Rodgers holds Gerrard is beyond question. Luis Suarez was the headline act but in those final, high-pressurised months, nobody did more than Gerrard to try to drag Liverpool to the title. Yet here we are, on November 1, and Gerrard’s future is still not ‘sorted’. It is a puzzling state of affairs. In 61 days, clubs around Europe will be free to talk to the 34-year-old about signing a contract with them. They will be forming a queue. Liverpool looked set to win the Premier League until they lost 2-0 against Chelsea at Anfield last season . Gerrard is the key link between the fans on the terraces and the players on the pitch at Liverpool Football Club . A lot has been made of Gerrard’s form this season but it hasn’t been anything like some have made it out to be. He is Liverpool’s joint-leading scorer and has played every minute of every Barclays Premier League and Champions League game. If Gerrard were to come on the market, there would be many courting him. Clubs in America, for example, and the Middle East. More than that, though, how many Champions League managers would take the chance to let their interest be known? The rampaging box-to-box bursts of his youth may have been phased out but the way Gerrard passes and strikes a ball remain as sweet as ever. There will come a day when he no longer wears Liverpool red, but that should not be next season. And it is not just about what he does on a match day. A young Gerrard making his Liverpool debut against Blackburn Rovers in November 1998 . The Anfield icon has a very specific fitness regime to keep himself in shape throughout the season . ‘Steven is a brilliant role model for me,’ said Jordan Rossiter, one of the brightest hopes at Liverpool’s academy. ‘Just watching him train helps me loads.’ Gerrard continues to set an example, to lead the club. There has been talk of him becoming an ambassador when he retires but he has been doing ambassadorial work for Liverpool throughout his career. Last week, his programme notes against Hull City signed off with a mention that his cousin Jon-Paul Gilhooley, one of the 96 who lost their lives at Hillsborough, would have been 36. ‘He and they are never far from our thoughts,’ Gerrard wrote. Gerrard, laughing in training, is Liverpool's joint-top scorer this season and has played continuously . Gerrard, challenged by Stewart Downing, was man-marked in defeats by West Ham and Aston Villa . Since Jamie Carragher retired, Gerrard has been the link between the pitch and the terraces. That Liverpool’s owners have let it get to this point suggests they do not quite appreciate Gerrard’s importance to this club. Allowing the situation to drift has been ham-fisted, and not telling the club captain of their plans lacks courtesy. Clubs tend to take older players for granted. Think of Chelsea with Frank Lampard, Manchester United with Rio Ferdinand. Yes, it makes business sense not to offer those in their 30s long-term deals but it does not mean they should be cast to one side and dealt with last. Of course, all this may be resolved before the new year but the dithering has resulted in Gerrard raising the prospect that he may play elsewhere next season. It should not have come to this. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers is a huge fan of Gerrard but the midfielder has not yet signed a new deal .","Steven Gerrard is Liverpool's joint-top scorer and has played continuously .
Contract expires at end of season and can talk to foreign clubs in January .
It is ridiculous that it has come to this because he deserves so much more .
He is the connection between the terraces and the pitch at Anfield ."
"Floyd Mayweather has hit back at Amir Khan after he claimed that the American's hotly anticipated fight with Manny Pacquiao could turn out to be 'boring' and 'dull'. Khan has criticised Mayweather's decision to finally fight Pacquiao instead of taking him on, describing the 38-year-old's choice as 'the easy route'. He also took aim at the timing of the fight, stating that it should have when both boxers were in top condition and not getting towards the end of their careers. Floyd Mayweather has disputed a claim from Amir Khan that his fight with Manny Pacquiao will be 'boring' Khan had hoped to secure a fight with either Mayweather or Pacquiao but he has been left disappointed . Pacquiao, pictured working out in Mindanao, has already started preparing for his fight with Mayweather . Khan told The Sun: 'The thing is when they were both at their peak - which was six years ago - this fight was talked about then and it should have happened then. 'That's when it would have been a great fight because they were both explosive. They were both at their peak and the fight would have been massive. They both seemed unbeatable back then. 'Six years later Manny Pacquiao has had two defeats and been knocked out. Mayweather has had some good fights but he is getting old and he's showing signs of ageing now. He is getting caught a lot more frequently. 'For me, this fight isn't going to be as explosive or as good as it would have been five or six years ago. Who knows, styles make fights. 'They're both very experienced but it could turn out to be a boring fight because there is just so much expectation on it.' Mayweather laughs while watching the Los Angeles Lakers take on the Boston Celtics on Sunday evening . Khan believes Mayweather is scared to face him after his impressive performance against Devon Alexander . Pacquiao was last in action when he dominated Chris Algieri over 12 rounds in Macau on November 23, 2014 . But Mayweather has disputed Khan's claims, instead promising that the Las Vegas bout on May 2 will live up to the hype. 'I am touched that Amir is concerned about the fight, and that it might be boring for the fans,' said Mayweather. 'He doesn't need to worry, the fact this has taken so long to happen only makes the anticipation and build up of the fight that much greater. 'I can even get him a ticket if he wants - so he can see what the biggest fight in the history of boxing looks like - and to appease any fears he might have about a boring fight.' Khan claims he was close to agreeing fights with both Mayweather and Pacquiao, but the unbeaten American believes the boxing world was not interested in seeing himself or Pacquiao take on the Bolton-born fighter. Mayweather posed with actor Rob Lowe at the LA Clippers game on Monday night . Mayweather last fought when he beat Marcos Maidana in the pair's rematch on September 13, 2014 . 'Of course he wanted to fight me, of course he wanted to fight Manny, I get that, I really do,' added Mayweather. 'The reality is that this is only fight the public were demanding and we had no choice but to give it to them. 'The world was not calling for Mayweather vs Khan or Pacquiao vs Khan. He knows that, he is a smart kid. He knows this fight had to happen. 'He (Amir) is a good fighter, I've got a lot of time for what he does in the ring. He is going to get big fights I am sure of that, but nothing or nobody was going to stand in the way of this fight - we are going to make history.'","Amir Khan believes Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao could be dull .

"Every cat owner likes to think they share a special bond with their feline friend, but experts believe that many people might be missing the chance to communicate effectively. Britain's leading cat charity has produced a video guide to cat behaviour after a study found many owners struggle to understand their pet. The Cats Protection video dispels popular myths such as cats licking their lips when they are hungry or wanting their tummies scratched when they roll over. Scroll down for video . Three quarters of cat owners polled by the Cats Protection charity did not know an upright tail means a moggy is pleased to see them and is trying to say hello . Animal lovers are often at a loss to explain why their cat extends its tail upwards or rubs against them. Three quarters of cat owners did not know an upright tail means a moggy is pleased to see them and is trying to say hello, while one in three thought a cat lies on its back when it wants its tummy tickled like a dog. In fact, it actually means cats are relaxed and trust you - and want their head rubbed briefly instead. Cat behaviour expert Nicky Trevorrow, . who works at the charity, said it is likely that owners may be being . scratched and bitten when they try to rub their cat's tummy - but cats see . the action as an abuse of the trust they are exhibiting and would . rather have their heads stroked. A third of owners thought their cat lies on its back when it wants its tummy tickled like a dog, but it actually means cats are relaxed and trust you - and want their head rubbed briefly instead . The charity's experts hope their 3 minute video guide will help people notice when their pet is happy or stressed. A third of the 1,100 cat owners surveyed failed to recognise a slow-blinking cat shows a calm, contented moggy, while two in three think a purring cat is always a happy one, when it could actually mean they are in pain. Four in ten puzzled owners did not realise a feline with flattened ears meant it is scared and in need of somewhere to hide. Pulling a frightened cat out of a hiding place in order to ""comfort it, could actually add to its stress, the guide reveals.

Half of owners were unaware cats signal stress by licking their lips, with three in ten thinking it means a cat is hungry or has dry lips .

Ms Trevorrow admitted cats' subtle' facial expressions can be difficult to read. 'Unlike . dogs and humans, cats have not evolved the complex facial muscles that . allow them to make obvious expressions,' she said. One in 20 people thought their cat was rubbing against furniture or walls because it had an itchy face but according to Ms Trevorrow, cats rub against things - usually with their cheeks or sides of their bodies - to deposit scent . 'They are more subtle and can be difficult to read, so owners also need to look for non-facial signals that can indicate how their cat is feeling. 'Many cat owners treat their pet like a human friend and think they are being kind when they lavish it with long, affectionate hugs. 'However, cats are quite solitary creatures and generally find this over the top - instead preferring frequent but brief attention.' Ms Trevorrow said owners can simply take more notice of their cat's behaviour to work out if it is being sociable or wants some time alone. Four in ten puzzled owners did not realise a feline with flattened ears meant it is scared and in need of somewhere to hide.

"Islamic State militants fighting in Syria and Iraq have released a sickening video of a young woman being stoned to death by a group of men - including her own father. The shocking footage is understood to have been filmed in the city of Hama and shows a bearded cleric ranting at the woman in Arabic and accusing her adultery while she pleads for her life. The woman turns to her father and begs his forgiveness but he coldly rejects her, saying he would rather please God. He then turns to the men to give the signal for his daughter's murder to begin. Minutes later, as the men rain rocks down upon the helpless woman, her father steps forward with a large stone and the video fades to black. It is believed he had been granted the barbaric 'honour' of being allowed end the life of the daughter he felt had betrayed both him and her religion. Scroll down for video . Terror: The bearded ISIS militant orders the woman to be 'content and happy' that she is about to be stoned to death because, he says, her death has been ordered by God. Her father (left) stands next to the extremist . Sickening: The woman is seen pleading for her life before being stoned to death by men - including her father . In a separate incident a man was executed in Idlib province in an area controlled by Islamist groups including the Nusra Front, al Qaeda's official affiliate in Syria, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which tracks violence on all sides of Syria's civil war. It is the first documented case of a man being stoned to death for adultery since Syria descended into civil war in 2011 and hardline Islamic groups emerged as powerful players in areas that slipped from government control, the Observatory said. The sickening five-minute video emerged on ISIS-affiliated social media pages this morning. It is not clear when the footage was actually shot and has not been independently verified. The exact accusations against the woman remain sketchy, although the cleric who appears at the start of mobile phone-filmed clip accuses her of committing adultery. The militant orders her to be 'content and happy' that she is about to be stoned to death because, he says, her death has been ordered by God and is therefore required under Islamic law. Asking her is she is now willing to 'submit to God' and be stoned to death, the young woman replies 'yes', before pleading with her father to forgive her. After initially ignoring her, the man is eventually prompted into responding by the militant. 'Don't call me father,' he tells his daughter, who responds by asking him to pray for her. At this point her father turns to the ISIS fighters, who help him tie a rope around her neck and drag her to a pit, where the stoning begins. Shocking: As the militants rain down rocks on the defenseless woman, her father (left) steps forward and picks up the largest rock before using it to strike and kill his daughter . The exact accusations against the woman remain sketchy, although the cleric who appears at the start of mobile phone-filmed clip accuses her of committing adultery. As the militants rain down rocks on the defenseless woman, her father steps forward and picks up the largest rock before using it to strike and kill his daughter. The exact moment of her death is not caught on camera as the footage fades to black moments before her father strikes her. ISIS militants often use stoning to murder women they accuse of committing adultery. Earlier this year the extremists stoned two women to death in Raqqa after accusing them of having sex outside marriage.  Both were placed in holes in the ground before a lorry arrived to dump large rocks for the men to use to brutally murder the women. A young Yazidi woman forced into sex slavery by the Islamic State begged the West to bomb the brothel where she was being held after militants raped her 30 times in just a few hours, it is claimed. The unidentified woman is understood to have been kept as a prisoner of the jihadists somewhere in western Iraq having been captured by ISIS during the Sinjar massacre in early August. A group raising awareness of ISIS' persecution of women in the vast swathes of the Middle East under its control said the woman had contacted Kurdish peshmerga fighters by telephone to plead for the brothel to be bombed to put the women held as sex slaves out of their misery. Horror: The woman said she had been raped so many times by ISIS militants (pictured) that she could no longer use the toilet, adding that the ordeal has been so harrowing that she plans to commit suicide even if freed . She allegedly told the fighters she had been raped so frequently that she could no longer use the toilet, adding that the ordeal has been so harrowing that she plans to commit suicide even if freed. Details of the woman's brutal experience at the hands of the Islamic State emerged during an interview with Kurdish activists staging demonstrations in London to raise awareness of the plight of women in the Middle East. During an interview with BBC World Service, a man identified as Karam described how a friend embedded with the peshmerga took a phone call from the Yazidi woman. Describing the woman as crying on the phone, Karam quoted her as saying: 'If you know where we are please bomb us... There is no life after this. I'm going to kill myself anyway - others have killed themselves this morning.' 'I've been raped 30 times and it's not even lunchtime. I can't go to the toilet. Please bomb us,' he claimed the woman added.","Shocking footage understood to have been filmed in Syrian city of Hama .

"Eurozone leaders must prepare for the break up of the single currency, the Finnish foreign minister has said. In an attack on the faltering Euro, Erkki Tuomioja said the that other countries were planning for a collapse. The senior politician warned that there was only a limited amount of time that rich smaller countries such as Finland could continue paying for profligate southern neighbours. Criticism: Finnish foreign minister Erkki Tuomioja, left, said he does not trust Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB) And in a stinging personal attack on ECB boss Mario Draghi, he said he 'did not trust' the clique of leaders pushing for fiscal union. The incendiary comments will stoke tensions with other eurozone leaders who will meet in October to consider Greece's finances. And British politicians whose calls for independence from the European Union are likely to seize on the calls from a leading figure for a break up. Mr Tuomioja told the Daily Telegraph that Finnish officials have prepared for the break up of the single currency with an 'operational plan for any eventuality.' 'It is not something that anybody - even the True Finns (a Eurosceptic opposition party) - are advocating in Finland, let alone the government. But we have to be prepared,' Tuomioja said. He said that it was 'only a matter of time' before a break up. Greece's Prime Minister is to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande next week to discuss the country's parlous finances . Mr Tuomioja said that Finnish officials have put in place a plan for the break-up. He added that 'this is what people everywhere' are thinking. And he slammed those who believe that the cost of a break up would cost more in the short and medium term than the billions being spent to keep the ailing single curreny on its feet. He said: 'Our officials, like everybody else and like every general staff, have some sort of operational plan for any eventuality. 'This is what people are thinking about everywhere. But there is a consensus that a euro zone break-up would cost more in the short-run or medium-run than managing the crisis.' City observers believe that Britain might experience a drop in output of just two per cent. The comments come ahead of a meeting with Greek officials in October when EU and IMF inspectors will report back on the parlous state of the indebted countries public finances. Greece is pleading with more time to ram through austerity measures against fierce resistance from politicians and voters, but its lenders want to see sweeping reform. Prime Minister Antonis Samaras is set to demand a two-year extension to the timetable for cuts required as a condition of the country’s bailouts when he meets German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande next week. The ECB headquarters in Germany. A break-up of the eurozone would have a knock-on effect on Britain . The Greek government is struggling to find another £9billion of cuts – around 5 per cent of its GDP – for 2013 and 2014. The austerity measures are required under the deal thrashed out with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, which have bailed out Greece. The country has two colossal bailouts, including a £100billion handout as recently as March. German officials have made  it clear that they have no intention of giving extra money to Athens since German taxpayers are furious that they keep being expected to bail out a nation where workers are less productive and retire earlier. Mr Tuomioja said that Eurozone countries could cut off lending which would lead to a default. But he added that ultimately it was down to Greece whether they left the currency. Mr Tuomioja is part of a coalition government of six parties. But taxpayers disillusioned with paying out large amounts to prop up the eurozone are becoming increasingly restless and turning to eurosceptic parties. Timo Soini, head of the Finns Party which won 19 per cent of votes at the last election, said voters were 'angry'. He added: 'Either the south or the north will . break away because this currency straitjacket is causing misery for . millions and destroying Europe’s future, . 'It is a total catastrophe. We are . going to run out of money the way we are going. But nobody in Europe . wants to be first to get out of the euro and take all the blame.' Meanwhile, Miapetra Kumpula-Natri, . chairman of the Finnish parliament’s Grand Committee on Europe, said . that there was a time limit to how long bailouts could continue. 'There is a feeling on the street that . there has to be a limit. I can’t say whether it is 10pc of GDP, or . what. It’s not written. But it is obvious that a small country can’t . help big countries eternally.' With Britain's economy tied to the plight of the eurozone - its biggest trading partner - any changes are likely to have significant knock-on effect.

An Australian National University team has successfully replicated a protein, which captures energy from sunlight in order to create biological systems, the same way plants do. Researchers found the protein had displayed 'electrical heartbeat', which is the key to photosynthesis - a process used by plants to convert sunlight into oxygen and energy used to power their systems. Scroll down for video . Dr Kastoori Hingorani and Professor Ron Pace hope the research will open up  possibilities for manufacturing hydrogen as a cheap and clean source of fuel . ARC Centre of Excellence for Translational Photosynthesis in the ANU Research School of Biology Dr Kastoori Hingorani said in a statement that 'water is abundant and so is sunlight.' 'It is an exciting prospect to use them to create hydrogen, and do it cheaply and safely,' Dr Kastoori Hingorani said. The study found hydrogen offers potential as a zero-carbon replacement for petroleum products, and is already used for launching space craft. However, until this work, the way that plants produce hydrogen by splitting water has been poorly understood. 'The system uses a naturally-occurring protein and does not need batteries or expensive metals, meaning it could be affordable in developing countries,' Dr Hingorani said. The way of the future: Australian scientists are one step closer from turning water and sunlight into cheap fuel . Co-researcher Professor Ron Pace said the research opened up new possibilities for manufacturing hydrogen as a cheap and clean source of fuel. 'This is the first time we have replicated the primary capture of energy from sunlight,' Professor Pace said. 'It’s the beginning of a whole suite of possibilities, such as creating a highly efficient fuel, or to trapping atmospheric carbon.' Professor Pace said large amounts of hydrogen fuel produced by artificial photosynthesis could transform the economy. 'That carbon-free cycle is essentially indefinitely sustainable. Sunlight is extraordinarily abundant, water is everywhere – the raw materials we need to make the fuel. And at the end of the usage cycle it goes back to water,' he said. The team found the protein had displayed 'electrical heartbeat' after sunlight exposure that is the key to photosynthesis . Scientists used a protein called ferritin, which is usually found in almost all living organisms and often stores iron but the team removed the iron and replaced it with the abundant metal, manganese, to closely resemble the water splitting site in photosynthesis. The researchers also replaced the protein with a light-sensitive pigment, Zinc Chlorin. When scientists shone light onto the modified ferritin, there was a clear indication of charge transfer just like in natural photosynthesis. The possibilities inspired visionary researcher Associate Professor Warwick Hillier, who led the research group until his death from brain cancer, earlier this year. 'Associate Professor Hillier imagined modifying E. coli so that it expresses the gene to create ready-made artificial photosynthetic proteins. It would be a self-replicating system – all you need to do is shine light on it,' Dr Hingorani said.","Australian scientists have  successfully replicated one of the crucial steps in photosynthesis .

"Newcastle United legend Alan Shearer has revealed his first ever experience of St James' Park was enough to convince him his future lay in professional football. Shearer scored 206 times in 404 appearances for the club, but it was a Kevin Keegan effort against Queens Park Rangers that first ignited his love of the game. 'I remember my first game like it was yesterday,' said Shearer. 'It was August 1982 and Newcastle were facing Queens Park Rangers.We took the metro and got there especially early to soak up the atmosphere, I bought a scarf on the way and couldn’t believe my dad when he told me he’d kept it to this day. Alan Shearer revealed the first game he ever went to at St James' Park was a 1-0 win over QPR in 1982 . After joining in 1996, Shearer scored 206 times in 404 appearances for the club . 'I’ll never forget the feeling of entering the Gallowgate, I couldn’t really see much of the game, but when we scored I got lifted in the air and felt total adulation. 'The atmosphere was unbelievable, we won 1-0 and I’d never felt anything like it before.' 'Seeing us win on my first game was special, but what made it even better was Kevin Keegan making his debut that day and scoring the winning goal. Seeing him run over to us with his arms held aloft was pure ecstasy, it was then that I knew I had to become a professional footballer. Shearer described the feeling of 'pure ecstasy' after Newcastle legend Kevin Keegan scored the winner . Keegan, right, was instrumental in bringing Shearer to Newcastle in 1996 . He added: 'The story continued when I was a ball boy at his final match for Newcastle, before he eventually signed me in 1996 and gave me the chance to represent my boyhood club and live out the best years of my career. I’ll always appreciate his role in helping me get to where I am today.' And now Premier League sponsors Barclays have launched a new initiative to ensure that other young supporters get their chance to fall in love with the game. The scheme will give away thousands of Premier League tickets to fans over the remainder of the 2014-15 season. Shearer said: 'The fact that Barclays are giving more and more young people the chance to experience football for the first time can only benefit the game for the future.' Shearer has teamed up with Barclays for a new ticketing initiative aimed at young fans . Shearer hopes that the more fans who can get along to games, the brighter the future of the sport will be .

"Theo Walcott has admitted he grew up fearing Gareth Bale during their time at Southampton - but more for his off-the-pitch activities rather than anything he did on the training field. The duo often roomed together when coming through the Saints' famed youth system and Walcott revealed that Bale was always trying to play pranks on him. 'I roomed with Gareth and shared digs with him right up to the day I moved to Arsenal,' Walcott said. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch .

'He was good company but you were always grateful to if you got back to your room unscathed when Gareth was around as he was a bit of a prankster. 'I had to be wary. He would do stunts like putting water on top of your door to try and soak you as you walked in, and silly things like that.' Walcott also revealed he had the option to join Chelsea when he was a youngster, but rejected the chance because he found Stamford Bridge 'daunting', and chose to move to the south coast instead. Walcott said that Real Madrid man Bale (left with another ex-Saint, Adam Lallana) was  'a bit of a prankster' Walcott turned down the opportunity to join Chelsea as youngster, preferring Southampton's 'family nature' 'It was the family nature of Southampton that made me turn down Chelsea as a kid,' Walcott said. 'Stamford Bridge was daunting.' Walcott could make his first start for Arsenal since January at Swansea on Sunday. He tore a ligament in an FA Cup tie at Tottenham at the start of the year and has only just returned.

"Harry Kane has been awarded the Barclays Premier League Player of the Month award for January after his impressive season continued with a blistering start to 2015. The forward has scored five goals in all competitions, including a double against Chelsea during a 5-3 victory. The 21-year-old is now being touted for an England call-up and has impressed the watching Roy Hodgson in recent months, who has now hinted Kane could be included in the next squad. Harry Kane has been awarded the Barclays Premier League Player of the Month award . Kane (left) scored against Liverpool but was unable to help his side gain all three points at Anfield . 'Is he worth a place in the squad now? Of course he is,' said Hodgson. Kane has helped propel Spurs into Champions League contention and bagged against Liverpool on Tuesday but couldn't help them gain three points. Having scored 23 goals this season and impressing throughout the busy Christmas period, it would have been hard to look at anyone else for the award. Queen Park Rangers' Charlie Austin won the award in December and Kane has now made it two English winners in a row. This is the Spurs forward's first award as he beat a number of his rivals to the prestigious prize. The 21-year-old (centre) has grabbed the attention of England boss Roy Hodgson who has hinted at a call-up . Oscar was another player in contention after his impressive month for Chelsea, which included three goals and two assists. Dwight Gayle was nominated after he helped Alan Pardew settle into life at Crystal Palace with three goals - including a double against Burnley. Makeshift centre back Emre Can of Liverpool also made the shortlist, with his solid performances helping his side to three clean sheets.

"Roger Federer made light work of Milos Raonic in his opening match of the ATP World Tour Finals in London with a straight sets victory (6-1, 7-6) over the Canadian. The world No 2, who lost his long-standing unbeaten record against Raonic in a 7-6, 7-5 defeat at last month's Paris Masters, produced a near faultless display in the first set as he cruised into a one-set lead. The Swiss broke Raonic on two occasions during the opening set, with the 23-year-old unable to deal with anything the seven-times Wimbledon champion put before him. Roger Federer returns a forehand in his opening ATP World Tour Finals match against Milos Raonic in London . The Canadian seventh seed attempts to make a return during a difficult first set for the 23-year-old . The No 2 seed shows his flexibility as he looks to return a shot from his opponent . Federer celebrates winning a point during the opening set while Raonic puts the work in to make a return . Raonic was unable to use his big serve to his advantage, with the 33-year-old returning every one of the serves the Croatian hit at him, as Federer easily won the first set 6-1. The second set was a lot more competitive to say the least, with Federer forced into saving two break points in his second service game, but he showed his class as he pegged back Raonic, before making it 2-2 with a sumptuous ace. And in his next service game he was put under pressure from Raonic again, but unsurprisingly the Swiss recovered well to win the game and make it 3-3. Raonic looks frustrated after falling to the ground when attempting to play a return to Federer . The 33-year-old acknowledges the crowd after sealing a straight sets win over Raonic in London . The Swiss No 1 is all smiles after receiving the Sportsmanship and Fan's Favourite award after his match . After just two forehand winners from Raonic in the entirety of the first set, the 23-year-old already had seven by the end of his five service games in the second set, proving more than a match for the experienced Swiss. The second set eventually went to a tie-break after no slip-ups from either player on the serve, but not before Raonic had a set point on Federer's service, with the imperious veteran hitting a brilliant first serve to yet again deny the Canadian. Federer started the tie-break confidently, breezing into a 3-0 lead after forcing Raonic into two unforced errors. And Raonic was unable to pull back that lead, as a double fault, as well as another unforced error, ensured Federer won the tie-break in devastating fashion (7-0), as he leapt ahead of Andy Murray and to the top of  Group B with the win.","Roger Federer lost in straight sets to Milos Raonic at the Paris Masters .

"Secret agent: U.S. country star Jerry Naylor has revealed he used his international fame as cover to run missions for the CIA . Ageing U.S. country star Jerry Naylor has sensationally revealed today he used his international fame as cover to work as a secret agent for the CIA. Naylor, 74, who replaced Buddy Holly in the Crickets, says he was recruited on more than 100 occasions to spy for America under his guise as a touring singer. He says he was first hired by American spooks in Japan in 1968 and asked to use his tour as cover to collect a briefcase from Taiwan. The singer, who enjoyed international success in the 1960s, agreed to help his country which was in the midst of the Vietnam war. During one six-month mission, Naylor then helped the U.S. government derail the presidential campaign of one of Colonel Gaddafi's close allies. He was also asked to use Chinese money to set up a bank on Marshall Island before handing ownership back over to the island's president. In another daring ploy, similar to Hollywood blockbuster Argo, Naylor was part of a film crew that monitored the training of terrorists in Lebanon's Baqaa Valley in the late 70s. The singer claimed other U.S. stars must have been recruited into similar roles. Jerry, of Oregon, in the USA, said: 'My work with the government started in 1968 while I was in tour in Japan. 'This man came up to me - and it was during the Vietnam War - and he just said that he was going to pick me up and send me to Taiwan. 'I had already been denied a visa there because of the war and I thought I was just going over there to do a few more performances. Well connected: Jerry Naylor meets President Ronald Reagan in the Oval Office in 1986. The musician says he was recruited on more than 100 occasions to spy for America under his guise as a touring singer . Spook: Jerry (pictured with Nancy and Ronald Reagan) said he also helped the U.S. government de-rail the presidential campaign of one of Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi's close allies . 'We got on a plane, went over to Taiwan, I got off, went over to this man, took his briefcase and then took him back to the mainland. 'I don't know what my wife and kids would think if anything happened to me or if I got blown up by a mortar. 'I got back to America and just carried on with whatever it was I was supposed to be doing. I still don't know what that whole meeting was about. I didn't get told any of the details. 'Because I was over there doing a solo tour it must have been easy to use me as cover.' International fame: Jerry (right) joined Sonny Curtis, Bobby Vee and Glen D Hardin in the Crickets after replacing Buddy Holly . Success: Jerry (second right), who dueted with Elvis and Jonny Cash, was brought in to replace Buddy Holly in The Crickets after the original singer died in a plane crash in 1959 . He added: 'It wasn't a formal arrangement. I would get a call and they would lay out what it was I would have to do. 'Sometimes it could be something small like charter a plane to somewhere. 'I think using celebrities from Los Angeles and Hollywood for covert operations is probably something that the CIA liked to do. I doubt I was the only one.' Jerry claims his biggest use has been as a cover for CIA agents who needed private jets booking without drawing attention to their movements. Double life: Jerry (pictured with American singer and actor Kris Kristofferson) says he was first hired by American spies in Japan in 1968 and asked to use his tour as cover to collect a briefcase from Taiwan . But he also saw action closer to the 'frontline'. In 1973, Jerry claims he was seconds from death when terrorists targeted an airport in Athens and killed 34 people. Rock n' roll icon: Buddy Holly died in 1959 at the age of just 22 . Between 1978 and 1982, Jerry worked on . the research and production of a film called 'The Bounty Hunter', which . he now claims was cover for monitoring terrorists in the Lebanon. And in 1991 he claims to have been recruited to help de-rail the presidential campaign of Colonel Rashid, one of Colonel Gaddafi's close allies in the volatile state of Bangladesh. Naylor spent six months helping Rashid promote his campaign and held numerous meetings with the tyrant in Switzerland and the Netherlands. But all the while he was feeding vital campaign information to Rashid's political opponent to ensure the extremist didn't win. The singer, who dueted with Elvis and Jonny Cash, was brought in to replace Buddy Holly in The Crickets after the original singer died in a plane crash in 1959. He spent five years touring the world with the band and charting top ten hits in countless countries around the globe. But when the band split in 1965 he decided to launch his own solo career, gaining three Grammy nominations for his single 'But For Love' in 1970. Jerry revealed his surprise past ahead of the release of his 50th anniversary tribute album 'The Rocabilly Legends'. The CIA declined to comment.","Naylor, 74, was first hired to collect briefcase from Taiwan on tour in 1968 .

"The common perception of purebred dogs is that they are more striking, beautiful animals than they would be without human intervention. However, that notion has been thrown to the dogs. Strong photographic evidence has emerged that shows how 100 years of breeding has actually warped the good looks of the original hounds. Scroll down for video . Ear we go: The basset hound has been transformed . Dog blogger Mus Musculus has published photographs of breeds taken in 1915, from Breeds Of All Nations by W E Mason, alongside photographs of the same variety taken recently to illustrate how their physical forms have been altered – and not necessarily for the better. He explained: ‘To be able to make an honest comparison, I’ve chosen pictures with similar poses and in a couple of cases flipped the picture to get them both aligned in the same direction. I had to skip some breeds I wanted to include because of the lack of detail in the older photographs.’ The modern boxer now has a shorter face and slightly upturned nose . His comparison shows how the Basset Hound has become lower and now has ‘excessively large ears’. The modern Boxer, he says, now has even more difficulty controlling temperature because its face is shorter and the muzzle is now slightly upturned. Size matters? The English bulldog is now a hefty animal compared to 100 years ago . The English bulldog – the star of the Churchill insurance ads – has become a real brute thanks to breeding. Musculus said: ‘The bulldog’s monstrous proportions make them virtually incapable of mating or birthing without medical intervention.’ How low can you go? The dachshund's legs are now much shorter . The Bull Terrier, meanwhile, now has a ‘mutated skull’ and is nowhere near as handsome as it used to be, according to Musculus. Photographs of the Dachshund show how its legs and body are no longer in proportion, meaning that it’s now more prone to intervertebral disc disease. Bigger and better? The St Bernard is now much stockier . The German Shepherd Dog has also gone downhill, according to the blogger. He says that they used to be able to clear an 8.5ft wall, but are now ‘angulated and barrel-chested’, meaning that such a feat would no longer be possible. Verdict: The dog blogger claims that the modern-day German shepherd would not be able to match its predecessor's athletic ability . Pugs have had a double-curl tail bred into them, but Musculus says that this can lead to paralysis. And its folded skin can lead to overheating. One of the most striking transformations is the St Bernard, which used to be a sturdy athletic breed but now have lots of overheating problems and are more prone to disease. Face facts: The bull terrier now has a different-shaped skull . Curly: The pug now has a tail that can lead to paralysis, the dog blogger explained . Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club Secretary, points out that there are both good and bad examples of dog breeding, partly because of the way it's organised. She told MailOnline: 'Dog breeding is a relatively unregulated industry, and for every responsible breeder producing healthy animals there is somebody breeding dogs for money and to achieve a certain fashionable look, who has no need to adhere to the health rules in the Breed Standards or to any other criteria. 'There are clear rules and vet checks in place at dog shows to ensure unhealthy and exaggerated dogs do not win prizes and the Kennel Club Assured Breeder Scheme is the only scheme in the country that sets standards for and monitors breeders, but outside of this there is no regulation to protect dogs or guide puppy buyers. 'Puppy buyers should always see the pup with its mother and avoid any puppies that come from parents with overly exaggerated features, which might include excessive wrinkling, overly short snouts or being overweight.'","Blogger Mus Musculus published old and modern dog photos side by side .

"Slurpee Australia hosted it's annual 'BYO Cup Day' at 7-11 stores nationwide on Monday, where anyone could fill up a cup brought from home for only $2.60 all day. If you had been looking for a use for your 'Most Improved Ping Pong Player for 1996' trophy or a sun-bleached P&O pina colada cup you bought on that cruise five years ago, then this was it. Slurpee enthusiasts came out in force, taking advantage of the generosity of the company and putting their creative talents to the test. One eager Slurpee fan decided a crock pot was his container of choice, filling it up with icy goodness today . Why not use a hollowed out rockmelon for your Slurpee?

From trick-or-treat buckets to popcorn containers, these Slurpee lovers tried it all! Will four litres of Slurpee be enough to satisfy this thirsty customer? Slurpee lovers stepped up to the BYO Cup Day challenge and posted hundreds of pictures of themselves . Monday saw every receptacle imaginable used as a container for multi-coloured, multi-flavoured, and brain-freeze inducing Slurpees. For every standard water jug, giant saucepan and old mop bucket, there wass an unexpected fish tank, hollowed out rockmelon and garbage-bin-lined wicker basket. For those wanting to join in the fun, there were only a few rules to keep in mind when pursuing that often elusive but now readily available Slurpee bang for your buck. Number one, no holes. There's nothing worse than the precious nectar flowing from the Slurpee machine escaping out of your well-chosen vessel. Olympian swimmer Emily Seebohm showed her appreciation, tweeting 'Best Day Ever!' A P&O cuo and a water jug- perfect container for the challenge! No more protein needed- just litres of multi-coloured icy fun! KFC buckets might just do the trick for these girls . A straw isn't good enough for this fan- a ladle is the only way to go! Number two, said container must not exceed 230mm by 260mm. This rule seems to be enforced more loosely than the first, perhaps because the novelty of seeing someone drag a kiddie pool into a convenience store far outweighs any monetary losses suffered. Fans ranging from everyday Australians to athletes such as Emily Seebohm showed their appreciation for the iced treat, with the Olympian swimmer tweeting a photo of herself and her Slurpee with the caption 'Bring your own cup day! Best day of the year!' The company also launched a competition encouraging customers to post their weird and wonderful Slurpee vessels. By posting a picture of their containers, they could win their 'head as a cup', and well as a year's supply of free Slurpee. Slurpee's photo competition has seen fans posting weird and wonderful BYO cups to their Facebook and Instagram pages since the early hours of Tuesday . Why not use an esky to keep your Slurpee cool all day? It's large and practical for slurping that icy treat . How about a novelty skull to drink from? Cereal containers have no better use- ditch the Special K and fill them up with Slurpee! Even an old plastic tray might just do the trick for some Slurpee fans .

"When a hungry hippo opened its jaws in a display of aggression to ward off a family of ravenous lions they quickly took the decision to retreat. The intimidating display was captured in set of pictures taken on the Chobe River in Botswana and they show the lone hippo baring its teeth for the prize of a young elephant's carcass. Despite being outnumbered, the large animal stares down the lioness and her cubs in order to secure the chance to feast on the remains. When a hungry hippo opened its jaws in a display of aggression to ward off a family of ravenous lions they quickly took the decision to retreat . Grant Atkinson, 46, a guide and wildlife photographer from South Africa who witnessed the spectacle, said: 'The lioness was feeding on a dead subadult elephant, that had died alongside the river of natural causes. 'Her cubs were feeding alongside. 'A solitary hippo approached, causing the cubs to leave the scene and hide, dragging off a bone with them.

"Sunny Islam, 23, has been jailed indefinitely because of the dangers he poses to women . A Muslim man who raped women to 'teach . them a lesson' for being on the streets at night was jailed indefinitely today . because of the danger he poses to women. Sunny Islam, 23, who comes from a strict . Muslim family, dragged his terrified victims - including a 15-year-old - from . the street at knifepoint, bound and assaulted them during a two-month reign of . terror. Police fear that Islam may have attacked many more. Three of the assaults took place close to his home in Barking, east London, while a fourth occurred in nearby Forest Gate. Judge Patricia Lees, sentencing him to a . minimum of 11 years, said: 'The . harm you have done to your victims is incalculable. 'The nature and extent of these offences . drives me to the conclusion that you represent an extreme and continuing danger . to women, particularly those out at night.' He was traced through the number plate of . his girlfriend's car after he kidnapped and raped the 15-year-old in September . 2010. He grabbed her from behind as she walked . home with a friend and bundled her into the car at knifepoint before driving to a . secluded spot where he raped her twice despite her claiming she was only 11 . years old. Judge Lees said: 'You told her you were . going to ""teach her a lesson"", and similar things were said to the other women. 'Those words are a chilling indictment of your very troubling attitude towards . all of these victims. 'You seem to observe women out at night as . not deserving respect or protection. After his arrest, Islam's DNA was linked with three other attacks near his home in Barking, east London . 'I have no doubt that you were out that . night looking for a victim, as you were on each of these occasions.' The teen, who feared she would be . murdered, was in court and smiled as her attacker was jailed. In a victim . impact statement read to the court, she said: 'No one will ever understand the . flashbacks - they are so real. At night, I lay in my bed and it is like I am . there. 'It is like a screen in my mind forcing me . to relive that night again and again. 'People will say time will heal, but I . think time has helped me accept the truth - that I will never escape what has . happened to me.' After his arrest, Islam's DNA was linked . with three other attacks near his home in Barking, prosecutor Sara Lawson told . Woolwich Crown Court. The judge said on July 8, 2010 he subjected . a 20-year-old prostitute to 'his trademark double rape' and then tied her up, . repeatedly punched her in the face and stole her wallet. She said: 'He . treated me like an animal and made me feel worthless - I thought I was going to . die.' Six days later, in Forest Gate, he struck again on a . 28-year-old when he dragged her into his car and forced her to commit a sex . act. She managed to kick out the back window of his car and escape despite . being throttled. His fourth victim, also attacked in . September, did not come forward until police found the 31-year-old's blood in . the back of the car along with a knife he used to threaten his victims and . plastic ties he bound them with. She was repeatedly repeatedly punched in . the face until she was bleeding and then tied up and raped twice. Islam, who told the jury he was a practising Muslim, was convicted of seven charges of rape, one of sexual assault and one of kidnap at Woolwich Crown Court . Islam, who told the jury he was a . practising Muslim, was convicted of seven charges of rape, one of sexual assault . and one of kidnap. Tana Adkin, defending, said: 'The only . piece of mitigation is his age. He was 21 at the time of these offences and . comes from something of a strict background.' His mother, in religious dress, sat with . her covered head bowed throughout and wept as her son was jailed. Judge Lees said: 'The fact that you have . attacked these women not withstanding your background must represent your own . wholly warped personality.' After the trial, Det Chief Insp John . Sandlin, of the Homicide and Serious Crime Command who investigated the . offences, said they believed there may be other victims who had not come . forward, but Islam has not been charged with any further offences.","Sunny Islam, 23, kidnapped and raped girl, 15 .

"The three Tornado jet crew lost in a crash in the Moray Firth this week were named for the first time today as Defence Secretary Philip Hammond today paid tribute to the pilots. Mr Hammond said Flight Lieutenant Hywel Poole had been killed, and Squadron Leader Samuel Bailey and Flight Lieutenant Adam Sanders were still missing presumed dead. 'My thoughts - and, I am sure, those of the entire House - are with their loved ones at this difficult time, and with the fourth member of the squadron involved in the incident, who is currently in a serious but stable condition in hospital,' he told MPs. The fatal mid-air crash off the north-east coast of Scotland between the two RAF Tornados may have been caused by fog, it was claimed earlier this week. Flight Lieutenant Hywel Poole, left, was killed in the RAF warplane crash while Squadron Leader Samuel Bailey, right, is missing presumed dead . Flight Lieutenant Adam Sanders is also missing presumed dead after the RAF Tornado crash in the Moray Firth north-east coast of Scotland in 'thick fog' The two planes – each carrying a . pilot and navigator – were not flying together but somehow collided at . high speed in bad weather. The pilots would not have spotted each other on their radar because it covers the ground and not the surrounding airspace. This raises the possibility they simply flew into each other in fog thick enough to hamper the rescue operation. Grieving: A family lays flowers at Lossiemouth airbase following the announcement that two airman are presumed dead and one confirmed dead following the collision between war planes . One line of inquiry will be whether either crew asked ground radar stations if other aircraft were nearby. Another . is tiredness. Families of military personnel at RAF Lossiemouth say . their loved ones were overworked and exhausted because of cutbacks. RAF sources say these claims are 'wrong and appalling'. Crash investigators will also explore the possibilities of mechanical failure, a bird strike and human error. Recovery: A member of the rescue team on a lifeboat with some of the plane wreckage after it was salvaged . Wreckage: A RNLI lifeboat carries parts of a crashed Tornado back to shore after two of the aircraft collided in mid-air over north-eastern Scotland . And . independent experts from the Military Aviation Authority will look at . the experience levels of the airmen at the controls of the planes. The . jets plunged into the Moray Firth about 25 miles south of Wick on . Tuesday after completing a practice bombing raid on a Ministry of . Defence firing range. Two . of the four airmen were plucked from the water and airlifted to . hospital. It is understood they had tried to eject from their stricken . warplane before it hit the water. One was pronounced dead but the other . is in intensive care at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. The search for the two . missing airmen was terminated last night by the Maritime and Coastguard . Agency, ending any hope of finding them alive. Tragedy: More wreckage from one of the crashed . planes is carried from the lifeboat after it arrived back in Buckie, a . town close to where the incident happened. Two airmen were rescued and . two are still missing . Mangled: Teams of volunteers pick through the wreckage gathered yesterday . Operation: One of the RNLI lifeboats which assisted with yesterday's search and rescue mission . Group . Captain Ian Gale, the Lossiemouth station commander, said the officer . confirmed dead was from 15 (Reserve) Squadron, which trains pilots and . weapon systems operators to fly the £40million Tornados. 'Two . additional personnel remain unaccounted for. We must be realistic,' he . added. 'Given the length of time that has elapsed since the accident, . there is no expectation of recovering missing personnel alive. 'It . is important that we establish the facts of what happened and it  is . vital that the investigation is allowed to take its course. 'But the priority now is to ensure . that the families of those involved receive the support they need at . this most difficult of times.' Crash: The two RAF planes crashed in the Moray Firth off the Scottish coast. It is understood they were on a training exercise and the crash happened in thick fog. It is not known if a technical fault is responsible . Speaking . in the House of Commons, David Cameron paid tribute to the airmen. The . Prime Minister said the incident was a reminder of the risks military . personnel took in training as well as on operations. 'It's clearly a very serious incident,' he added. Last . night a relative of a serviceman at Lossiemouth said: 'The reason that . these crashes are happening is because everybody is undermanned, the . engineers are overworked. 'The planes are too old. They can no longer fix them properly. 'It's having a massive impact [on safety] because when they're flying, they're knackered. 'There's . so much going round in their heads when they're flying now that it's . very, very difficult to concentrate on flying. Somebody really high in . the RAF is not saying to the Government, “We can't do that”.' The claims were vehemently rejected by military sources. Base: The pair rescued were based at RAF Lossiemouth, pictured, and have been taken to hospital in Inverness . A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: 'A full investigation into this incident will carried out by the Military Aviation Authority, which will be an independent investigation looking at all the possibilities of what might have happened.' Wreckage from the planes has been found and the fuselages are likely to be salvaged this weekend. The Tornados were understood to be on a low-flying exercise at the time of the accident. Military sources said that the two jets had collided during the exercise but investigators will also look at whether either plane suffered a technical malfunction or accidentally ditched into the sea. The fact that two crewmen had been recovered with dinghys and parachutes indicated they had managed to bail out of the doomed aircraft before it struck the water. First Minister Alex Salmond said: 'This is clearly a very serious incident and my thoughts are with the loved ones of those affected. 'I understand rescue services have done all they can to help with the situation and offer my thanks to all those involved. The Scottish Government stands ready to offer any necessary assistance, and we will make a further statement once more details are confirmed.' Moray MP Angus Robertson, the SNP’s defence spokesman, said: 'My first thoughts are with the crew, their families and colleagues. Everyone in Moray has a connection with the RAF and this incident will be felt right across the community. 'The priority must now be for the . support of the affected families and for the authorities to investigate . the causes of this incident and ensure the future safety of flying . operations and personnel.' RAF . Lossiemouth is home to 617 Squadron - currently serving in Afghanistan - . 12 (Bomber) Squadron and 15 (Reserve) Squadron, which trains up to 40 . Tornado pilots and crew. The . Tornado GR4 is a two-seat attack aircraft which is capable of . delivering a variety of bombs and missiles, including Brimstone, Paveway . and Storm Shadow, has a maximum altitude of 50,000ft and a top speed of . Mach 1.3. The Tornado has . been in service with the RAF since 1979 and the frontline squadrons are . veterans of a string of conflicts with hundreds of hours flying . experience. It first saw combat in Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War and has since been deployed in Kosovo in 1999, the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Afghanistan since 2009, and last year enforcing the no-fly zone over Libya. Tornado aircraft have been involved in crashes in Scotland in recent years. In January last year two RAF crew were rescued after their Tornado GR4 jet came down in the sea off the west coast of Scotland. The crew, from RAF Lossiemouth, ejected from the plane before it landed in the waters at Loch Ewe, near Gairloch, Wester Ross. In July 2009 an RAF pilot and navigator were killed when their Tornado jet crashed into a hillside in Argyll. Flight Lieutenant Kenneth Thompson, 27, and Flight Lieutenant Nigel Morton, 43, died in the crash near the village of Arrochar. The aircraft was a RAF Leuchars-based Tornado F3 on a routine flight. Warplane: The two-seater Tornado GR4 is a versatile and heavily-armed attack aircraft capable of supersonic speeds . The two-seater Tornado GR4 is a versatile and heavily-armed attack aircraft capable of supersonic speeds. It has been flown in thousands of sorties during military operations since 1990, including Iraq, Kosovo, Afghanistan, and most recently, Libya. RAF Lossiemouth in north Scotland is home to three of the six squadrons based in the UK - 12 (Bomber) Squadron, 617 Squadron and 15 (Reserve) Squadron. The other three, 9 (Bomber) Squadron, 31 Squadron, and 2 (Army Co-operation) Squadron are based at RAF Marham in Norfolk. According to the RAF website: 'The Tornado GR4 is a variable geometry, two-seat, day or night, all-weather attack aircraft, capable of delivering a wide variety of weapons.' Its two RR RB199 Mk103 turbofan engines each produce 16,000lbs of thrust. It is 56.5ft (17.2m) long, has a span of 28.1ft (8.6m) and has a maximum altitude of 50,000ft (15 240m). Tornado GR4s are capable of flying at Mach 1.3, which is around 990mph. 'The aircraft can fly automatically at low level using Terrain Following Radar (TFR) when poor weather prevents visual flight. The aircraft is also equipped with Forward Looking InfraRed (FLIR) and is Night Vision Goggle (NVG) compatible,' the RAF website said. The GR4 typically carries up to five Paveway IV smart weapons or two Storm Shadow cruise missiles. It is also equipped with the Storm Shadow missile and two variants of the Brimstone missile, and can be configured to carry other various weapons, targeting pods and reconnaissance pods. All GR4 aircraft can carry the Air Launched Anti-Radiation Missile (ALARM), which homes on to the emitted radiation of enemy radar systems and can be used in the Suppression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD) role. It is also equipped with an integral 27mm Mauser cannon capable of firing 1,700 rounds per minute.","The planes, based at RAF Lossiemouth, collided mid-air off the north-east coast of Scotland yesterday .

For women, 75-year-olds who smoke, drink, eat little fruit and avoid exercise had a 45 per cent chance of living another decade - compared to 74 per cent for the healthiest women. The long-term study of almost 17,000 people was carried out by researchers at the University of Zurich in Switzerland. They asked participants key questions about four of life's biggest 'risk factors': whether they drank, smoked, did exercise and ate fruit. The scientists' findings revealed a 75-year-old with a healthy lifestyle can have a better life expectancy than a 65-year-old with unhealthy habits. And their figures were used to create a fascinating 'health calculator' - claimed to be the first of its kind - which the researchers say could become a vital tool for GPs.

'They can also . be important for the political discussion of prevention strategies for . non-communicable diseases.' Smoking had a far larger impact than the other three factors put together, the researchers found. They said smokers in their group raised their risk of dying early by 57 per cent. Poor nutrition, lack of exercise and alcohol abuse, meanwhile, raised the risk of early death by about 15 per cent. The influence of the four factors 'remained visible when biological risk factors such as body weight and blood pressure were taken into account', the study said. The research comes after a University of Essex study found pensioners could gain their exercise in unexpected ways - including the Nintendo Wii.

"Victoria avoids all eye contact. Her gaze alternates between boring into the ground and scouring the horizon out the window. Her right foot taps nervously on the wooden floor. She is one of the 55 female trafficking victims helped each year at the crisis intervention centre run by the International Organisation for Migration and the Ministry of Labour in the Moldovan capital, Chisinau. Her story is shocking. 'A childhood friend told me she worked in a boutique in Dubai and could help me get a similar job,' she explains. 'She put me in touch with a guy who arranged my trip to Odessa [in Ukraine] and onward from Kiev to Dubai. Haunted: One of the women currently being helped by in the IMO's Chisinau anti-trafficking centre . 'In Dubai I was met by a Russian speaking woman, Oxana, who took me to a flat with six other girls from Eastern Europe. 'Oxana told me I’d been sold and took my passport away. I refused to see clients and as a result, was denied food. My cries and pleas were met with blows and kicks.' Appalling though it is, Victoria is by no means alone. She's just one of an estimated 800,000 women and children tricked and trafficked into a life of beatings, rape and torture every year. In Moldova, the country that she - and I - once called home, human trafficking is a huge problem, with an estimated 25,000 Moldovans trafficked abroad in 2008 according to Moldova’s national Bureau of Statistics. Men are taken to work on building sites and farms, while women like Victoria are mostly sold into the sex trade in Turkey, Russia, Cyprus, the UAE, and elsewhere. Tragic: Victoria is just one of an estimated 800,000 women sold into sex slavery abroad each year . Hell: Many of those taken abroad suffer extreme violence and are beaten and raped by their 'owners' Speaking out: Stela Brinzeanu's new novel Bessarabian Nights focuses on trafficking . Victims can be as young as . 12-years-old, with the International Organisation for Migration . estimating that 10 per cent of the Moldovans taken are children. I met Victoria while researching my . novel, Bessarabian Nights, which follows two friends as they attempt to . save a third from the trafficking gangs still common in Eastern Europe. Shockingly, many of the women I spoke to had been sold into prostitution by people they knew and told me that many of recruiters were women. Some of the girls didn't even think of themselves as victims: Having previously been abused . by family members, they considered violence to be normal. One . girl who certainly thought that way was Irina, a girl brutalised and left . pregnant by her violent father before being trafficked to Turkey. ‘There is nothing extraordinary or . unusual about my story. Or I don’t think so,' she told me. 'Like many other families in . Moldova, ours was very poor – so poor we fed our dog dried corn. 'After my mother died of breast cancer and father went to prison for raping me, I was left alone and pregnant. 'My godmother offered to help with the abortion and arranged for me to go . to Turkey. ""The conditions are much better there and they’ll look after . you,"" she told me. 'At the airport in Istanbul I was met by two men who . drove me to a property where there were three other girls, Moldovan and . Ukrainian, and told me I was to serve their clients. 'I told them I was . pregnant but the men raped me in the next room that same day.' Frightening: Most of the women and children trafficked endure months if not years of torture before rescue . For rural girls like Irina, high . unemployment, widespread domestic violence and rife alcoholism further . exacerbate the problem and make them more vulnerable to human . trafficking than their city dwelling counterparts. Over half the victims I met were from the . Moldovan countryside, where a patriarchal mentality and religious . traditions still uphold discrimination against women. The recruiters exploit the fact that . these people are less knowledgeable about the process and risks of . moving abroad for work, and as in Irina's case, tell them they'll be well treated when, in fact, the reality is quite different. Although many do eventually escape their captors, the impact of being forced into slavery can have severe emotional consequences as Victoria makes plain. 'Locked up and under constant security, I saw no way out,' she continues. 'Weak from starvation and abuse, I agreed to seeing clients. 'There was no choice but work the streets and nightclubs every day, sometimes serving up to a dozen men or even more.

'My captors took all the money on the . pretext I owed them for flights and accommodation. The security guy who . drove me everywhere raped me every time I refused his advances, which . was almost daily. 'My bruises and cuts were habitually covered with cheap make-up. After a few weeks I managed to use the phone of one of my clients and called a friend I knew in Dubai. 'She . helped me run away and report my circumstances to a charity . organisation there. I was promptly returned to Moldova.' Others, such as Irina, find ways to adapt - even if that means overcoming repeatedly being raped when dealing with the aftermath of an abortion. 'I . cried and pleaded them to spare me the ordeal [of being prostituted] but was told they had . paid good money for me, which I had to return,' continues Irina. 'I was driven to various . hotels and houses to see men for two weeks before I had the abortion. Days after, I was taken to see clients again. 'It . was dreadful at the beginning and I was frightened. But the living . conditions there were a lot better than at home and they gave us plenty . of food too. 'I worked in Turkey for a year before we were arrested . following a police raid and sent back to Moldova and Ukraine, . penniless.' Although for Irina and Victoria the nightmare is, for now at least, over, while poverty and unemployment in Moldova remain rampant, the problem is likely to continue. Warning girls of . the risks abroad is not enough. Viable alternatives such as skills . training, employment opportunities and investment in human potential, . needs to be more widely available. Otherwise, regardless of the . potential risks, men, women and children will continue to be trafficked out of Moldova. Ignorance, as much as . desperation, is what sends them abroad.

"Brave: Malala Yousafzai, 14, publicly condemned the Taliban's brutal atrocities and campaigned like mad for girls' education. She is now fighting for her life after being shot in the neck and head at close range . Malala Yousafzai is 14 years old. In the past three years, she has become Pakistan’s most famous schoolgirl, the winner of numerous peace prizes and a national award for bravery, as well as an international symbol of resistance against the Taliban. Because as they tortured and slaughtered their way through her home town of Mingora in the Swat Valley of north-west Pakistan, Malala dared to do what so few others did. She publicly condemned the Taliban’s brutal atrocities and campaigned like mad for girls’ education — first in an anonymous blog and later, when her cover was blown, in newspaper interviews and on national and international television. Today, she is fighting for her life after being shot in the neck and head at close range while she sat with classmates on a bus in the school grounds in Mingora, waiting for a lift home after morning classes. Witnesses said a bearded man asked for Malala by name before opening fire. Another girl on the bus was also wounded. The Tehreek-iTaliban Pakistan (TTP) accepted responsibility and promised that if Malala survives their bullets, they will target her again. And again. Malala, meanwhile, was whisked away by military helicopter, first to an intensive care ward in Peshawar — where doctors operated for three hours to remove the bullet and reduce the dangerous swelling in her head. Yesterday, as she recuperated and the international community was united in revulsion at the Taliban’s latest atrocity, speculation was mounting that Malala’s next destination will be Britain. Malala was just 11 when she started writing a blog for the BBC Urdu service in January 2009. Two years earlier, the Taliban had begun infiltrating the beautiful Swat Valley — known as the Switzerland of Pakistan and popular with honeymooners — and by 2009 they’d assumed almost total control of the previously peaceful valley, imposing Sharia law with monstrous force. All women had to wear the burka and were banned from shopping and going to market. More than 400 schools were closed overnight. Dissenters were flogged in the streets. Militants controlled all checkpoints. Discipline was ruthless and brutal. Men and women deemed un-Islamic were slaughtered and their decapitated bodies left hanging in the squares of Mingora as warnings. Scroll down for video . Heartbreaking: Hospital staff assists Malala after she was wounded in a gun attack. Taliban gunmen in Pakistan took responsibility for the shooting . But Malala, a shy and obedient girl . with dimples and huge, dark eyes — and encouraged by her father . Ziauddin, a school owner, poet and fellow educational activist — wasn’t . afraid to speak out. ‘I was . scared enough to see the pictures of bodies hanging in Swat,’ she said . in an interview earlier this year. ‘But the decision to ban girls from . going to school was choking me and I decided to stand against the force . of backwardness.’ So she . started blogging — under the pseudonym Gul Makai, which means cornflower . in her local Pashto language and which she much prefers to her own . name, which translates as ‘grief stricken’. Malala said the blog was ‘like a mirror’ that described everything that happened to her and her friends during the occupation — how they were forced to hide books under their shawls and lived in fear of having acid thrown in their faces. How the Taliban flogged women in public and killed dissenters. She wrote of the terrible dreams she had of military helicopters and the Taliban, and of her scarily shrinking class, as friends were too terrified to turn up at school. Wounded: Hospital staff assist Malala Yousafzai . as she arrives at Saidu Sharif Teaching Hospital after the attack in the . Swat Valley region in northwest Pakistan . Help: Crowds gathered around the hospital as news quickly spread about the attempted assassination of the young peace activist . ‘My mother made me breakfast and I . went off to school,’ she wrote on January 3, 2009. ‘I was afraid going . to school because the Taliban had issued an edict banning all girls from . attending schools. Only 11 students attended the class out of 27. ‘On . my way home I heard a man saying: ‘I will kill you.’ I hastened my pace . and after a while I looked back. But to my utter relief he was on his . mobile and must have been threatening someone else.’ The . following day, she continued: ‘Today is a holiday and I woke up later, . around 10am. I heard my father talking about another three bodies lying . at Green Chowk (crossing). I felt bad on hearing this . . . we all used . to go to Marghazar, Fiza Ghat and Kanju for picnics on Sundays. But we . haven’t been out on a picnic for over a year and a half.’ Every day produced a new, humbling entry. Friday, . January 9: ‘I switched on the TV in the evening and heard about the . blasts in Lahore. I said to myself: “Why do these blasts keep happening . in Pakistan?” ’ Support: Hundreds of people gathered outside the hospital willing to give blood to save Malala Yousafzai . Wednesday, . January 14: ‘I may not go to school again. Since today was the last day . of our school, we decided to play in the playground a bit longer. I am . of the view that the school will one day reopen but while leaving I . looked up at the building as if I would not come here again.’ The next day her school had been . closed down and she wrote: ‘The night was filled with the noise of . artillery fire and I woke up three times. But since there was no school I . got up later at 10am. Afterwards, my friend came over and we discussed our homework.’ The . simplicity and the honesty of her writing propelled her on to the . international stage: ‘Some people are afraid of ghosts, some people are . afraid of spiders. In Swat we are afraid of humans. But not humans like . us — these were barbarians.’ Her . father — who received death threats himself — was aware of the dangers . she faced. ‘It was a risk, but not talking was a greater  risk than . that,’ he said. ‘A couple of times, letters were thrown in our house . warning that Malala should stop doing what she is doing or the outcome . will be very bad. ‘But Malala was never fearful. She would frequently say: “I am satisfied. I am doing good work for my people so nobody can do anything to me.” ’ Attacked: Malala Yousafzai was shot on her way home from school . Malala continued writing and campaigning even when her friends recognised her from the diaries and her cover was blown. ‘I kept going because it was the only mission I had,’ she said. ‘It was risky, but we wanted to go to school and it was our mission. We thought the Taliban did not have access to the internet and they were backward and they came from the mountains.’ She didn’t even stop when Pakistani troops arrived to launch an attack against the militants and she and her young brothers had to flee their beloved city, not knowing if they would return. Or if there would be anything to return to. For months, the war displaced and separated her family. It was agony for Malala. ‘Leaving our home was like growing apart from our heart,’ she said. ‘Our home is our heart. It was a very difficult and bad time.’ Once the Taliban had been driven from the lush plains of the Swat Valley and the family returned, the first thing Malala did was to check that her school books and notes were intact. Her campaigning gathered more momentum and she became bolder and bolder. She pleaded with President Obama’s special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, to intervene. She hosted foreign diplomats in Swat, held news conferences on peace and education and won a host of peace awards, national and international, and Pakistan’s highest civilian prize. She even started work on the Malala Education Foundation — to ensure all poor girls in Swat could go to school — and planned her future as a politician. ‘I will carry on my work for the girls and I will speak out for their rights,’ she said. Most importantly, she went back to school, where classmates called her ‘the life of the class’. Outrage: Activists carry photographs of Malala . Yousafzai during a protest rally against her assassination attempt in . Lahore . United: Women hold banners demanding education rights during a protest in Islamabad . With all she’s achieved so far in her . desperately short life, it is easy to forget that, as well as being a . ‘steady, calming force’, Malala is a teenager who likes shopping and . jewellery and giggling with her friends and, given half the chance, . watching trashy American sitcoms on television. Let’s hope she gets to do all of those things once again. Yesterday, . her father — who turned down offers of protection from security forces . because he believed that not even the Taliban would stoop so low as to . target a school girl — was insisting the shooting would stop neither him . nor his daughter from their work. He can’t allow the Taliban to think . for a moment that it has won. But as a British visa was obtained for Malala and surgeons in the UK were fully briefed about her condition, there was every indication she and her family could be planning to come here for medical help and refuge. And with Taliban death threats hanging over her, Malala will not be able to return to her beloved Swat, and perhaps even Pakistan, for a long time to come. In a recent interview, her desperately proud father said of Malala: ‘She is very committed to life. She values life.’ Let’s just hope that after all she’s been through, she has the strength to build herself a new one.","Malala Yousafzai, 14, publicly condemned the Taliban's brutal atrocities .

"This is the moment a BBC film crew were held by security teams at the notoriously secretive Area 51 - where conspiracy theorists believe the American government is hiding a flying saucer. Irish comedian Andrew Maxwell and UFO . expert Darren Perks sneaked past the border at the site  - and were forced to lie on the . ground at gunpoint for three hours while the FBI checked their . credentials. It is the same 'documentary' team that caused outrage in Britain last week when they suggested that the 7/7 London bombings were part of a government conspiracy to boost support for the Iraq war. Do not enter: The moment the team sneak into Area 51 - and security teams immediately step in to arrest them . A member of Area 51's security team can be seen (second from left) talking to the group . The 'UFO: Conspiracy Road Trip' documentary, airing next Monday, will show how the BBC film crew were arrested at gunpoint. They were forced to lie on the ground for three hours as guards surrounded them armed with M16 assault rifles. The . crew, 12 people in total, were investigating Area 51 in Nevada - where . the U.S. military allegedly hold the bodies of aliens and the remnants . of ships which crashed in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. As they crossed the border, military officers arrested them, confiscating their phones, wallets and identification. Darren told the Mail Online: 'Basically the concept . of the trip was to tour across California, Arizona and Nevada with . comedian presenter Andrew Maxwell and four people who had an interest in . the UFO phenomena. 'We went to Area 51 in Nevada firstly . because it’s related to the UFO phenomena and secondly so we could do a . night time sky watch to see if we could spot anything unusual. 'On May 14 we arrived there at approximately 5pm.' Getting ready to cross: The team of 12 hesitate at the gates - and then decide to cross over . All quiet... The team were able to hang around on the border for 30 minutes without interruption . 'We drove to the nearby township of . Rachel which is the closet public residency to Area 51 base and drove . down a dirt road to the ‘Back Gate’ of Area 51 officially known as . ‘Rachel Gate NT TR Boundary North’. 'We stopped the tour bus approx 50 metres from the restricted area barriers and started to film. 'There was no one around, no guards, no vehicles - nothing. 'We filmed for approximately 30 minutes and tried to call the guards but there was no one there and no sign of them. 'So we all decided to walk past the . barriers onto the restricted area past the security huts and basically . onto Area 51. Nothing happened....' Taken within the base: The team managed a few images before they were captured, showing some of the out-houses of the base . The back gate of Area 51: The team risked six months in jail by entering . He continued: 'We filmed again for another 30 minutes and even messed around doing a silly dance, but still no guards. 'Then . one of the other stars of the trip pointed out that on looking through . one of the security hut windows, she could see the guards all sitting . down eating dinner and watching the basketball game on TV. They did . nothing. 'So after a few . more minutes and a few more picture taking and filming, one of the crew . decided to speak to the guards and knocked on their hut door. All hell . broke loose.' 'The guards rushed out with their weapons and forced us all to lay face down at gunpoint in the tarmac. 'We were all searched, had our phones, wallets and IDs taken and the film equipment taken. This was at approx 6:15pm. 'For three hours we lay face down until the Lincoln County Sheriffs arrived on scene. 'Things then eased off a bit and we were all then taken one by one off the restricted area to the sheriffs who issued us with a ticket and grilled us about what we were doing. We all got fined £375 each. 'We were told that this incident was so serious that Washington had to call London to advise that 12 'Brits' had just breached security at America's most top-secret military base and that we all were at one point going to jail for six months. 'Luckily whoever it was in Washington was kind enough to just fine us.' Strange lights in the sky: It took three hours until the team could resume filming again (...and the strange light is just a searchlight!) The team spent three hours lying on the ground while their identities were checked - then Darren was allowed back to his car, where he took more sneaky images . Written order: This warning was given to the team as they left . He continued: 'As time went on into . the evening at approximately 11pm we were allowed to stand around together . while things were signed off to let us go. 'At this point I managed to talk to . the guards a bit and one told me how they could 'make you disappear and . your body will never be found'. UFO expert: Darren Perks is a believer that Earth has visitors . 'He also pointed out that an Apache . attack helicopter had been scrambled and had been monitoring us from two . miles away and that over 20 military guards had driven up from the . actual base to deal with the incident. There were quite a few of them . there with guns! 'One guard I quizzed let slip that . there are sensors in the ground that can detect approaching vehicles and . walkers up in the nearby mountains, so they know if people are getting . too close as they cannot put fences up because the area is so big. 'Then at about 11:30pm we were allowed to leave on the bus and we went back to our hotel at the nearby town of Alamo Nevada. 'Because the film equipment had been . taken by the FBI we had to wait to get new kit from Vegas so we had a . day of rest but we were followed everywhere by unmarked Government . vehicles. 'They stuck out like a sore thumb to . me. It was myself that pointed this out to the others otherwise they . would not have been aware of being followed. 'The following night I conducted a . sky watch at the famous ‘mailbox’ which is really close to the Area 51 . boundary and base, to see if we could see anything unusual or UFOs. 'I used a night vision device from a . company called Scott Country International and we were able to view the . training area and nearby mountains. 'It was probably the most messed-up day of my life so far - but I don’t regret it at all.' The infamous white letter-box: This signpost is often listed on visitor guides as a sign that you are within 20 miles of the infamous base . The road leading past the base became known - colloquially and then formally - as the Extraterrestrial Highway: Darren Perks is pictured at the site . The Roswell crash has gone down in conspiracy theory circles as a U.S. government cover up. Believers say that aliens in a flying saucer crashed in Roswell, New Mexico with badly injured aliens on board in June or July 1947. At the time spokesmen from Roswell army air base said that a 'flying disc' was found - but just hours later retracted the statement insisting instead that it was a weather balloon. The story took an interesting twist three years ago. Lieutenant Walter Haut was the public relations officer at the base in 1947. He was the man who issued the original and subsequent press releases after the crash on the orders of the base commander, Colonel William Blanchard. Haut died in 2006, but left a sworn affidavit to be opened only after his death. The text asserts that the weather balloon claim was a cover story, and that the real object had been recovered by the military and stored in a hangar. He described seeing not just the craft, but alien bodies. Infamous: Iconic image of the alien autopsy footage said to have been carried out after a UFO crash in 1947 . Video: 'Alien autopsy' footage 'leaked from Area 51 .

"Protests spread across Pakistan today in response to the shooting of 14-year-old Malala Yousafzai by a Taliban assassin which left her fighting for life. Surgeons today said they have successfully removed a bullet from the teenager, who was shot in front of her classmates on board her school bus yesterday. Malala was waiting to leave the grounds of her school in Mingora, in Pakistan’s Swat Valley, when a bearded man entered the bus and shot her and another girl. Scroll down for video . Outrage: Activists carry photographs of Malala Yousafzai during a protest rally against her assassination attempt . The 14-year-old is widely known and . respected for her work to promote the schooling of girls and denouncing the atrocities committed by the Taliban. Fury over the attack has spread across . the country, with demonstrators protesting in Lahore, Peshawar, . Islamabad and Mingora earlier today. Attacked: Malala Yousafzai was shot on her way home from school . Many schools in Swat Valley closed their doors in protest over the shooting, and the country's army chief vowed to fight on against militants as anger erupted across the nation. The Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) have taken responsibility for the assassination attempt and told a Pakistani newspaper they will target her again if she survives. Malala suffered wounds to her . head and neck in the attack yesterday afternoon. The other shot girl is in a stable condition. A man approached the school bus and . asked which one of the girls was Malala, Rasool Shah, Mingora police . chief said. Malala was pointed out by a girl near her, but after the young activist lied about her identity the gunman shot both of them. A spokesman for the TTP told Pakistani . newspaper The Express Tribune that Malala was shot because she was a . ’secular-minded lady’ and that this should serve as a warning for other . young people like her. The country's top military officer, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, issued a strongly-worded statement condemning the attack. Support: Demonstrators in Mingora hold banners reading 'we want peace on our motherland' and 'attack on Malala Yousafzai is an unsuccessful attempt to destroy peace in the valley' Anger: Banners condemning the attack are held up in Peshawar yesterday . United: Women hold banners demanding education rights during a protest in Islamabad . The powerful army chief rarely makes such public pronouncements, even when it comes to military matters. Referring . to the 2009 military operation that saved Swat Valley from Taliban . control, he said: 'In attacking Malala, the terrorists . have failed to grasp that she is not only an individual, but an icon of . courage and hope who vindicates the great sacrifices that the people of . Swat and the nation gave, for wresting the valley from the scourge of . terrorism.' As well as . the closure of schools, flags in front of the Mingora government . headquarters were at half-mast, and police officers stood guard outside . Malala's family's house in case they were also targeted by Taliban . assassins. Speaking from an undisclosed location, Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan said that Malala would not be safe if she survives. Recovering: A 'stable' Malala Yousafzai, is moved to a helicopter to be taken to Peshawar for treatment . Wounded: Hospital staff assist Malala Yousafzai as she arrives at Saidu Sharif Teaching Hospital after the attack in the Swat Valley region in northwest Pakistan . Help: Crowds gathered around the hospital as news quickly spread about the attempted assassination of the young peace activist . Malala was still said to be . unconscious after her surgery and she may need to be taken to a foreign . hospital for further specialist treatment. But doctors were happy she . was out of danger. She won the Pakistani National Youth Peace Prize last year. She and her family have previously . been threatened by the Taliban for her campaigns and authorities must now decide how they can protect her from future attack. The failed assassination displayed . the viciousness of Islamic militants in Swat Valley, an area which has struggled . with militant insurgent influence despite military operations. At . one time the picturesque region - nicknamed the Switzerland of Pakistan . - was a popular tourist destination for Pakistanis. Honeymooners . vacationed along the river. Stable: Malala being transported between hospital wards. The teenage Pakistani children's rights activist was shot in the head on a school bus in the former Taliban stronghold of Swat . Attempt: A Pakistani Taliban organisation have taken responsibility for the shooting which also injured another girl on the bus leaving their school in Mingora . Then the Taliban in 2007 began infiltrating the valley, eventually assuming near-total control of the region before being ejected in a massive Pakistani military operation in 2009. A . recent court case highlights the issues facing young women in Pakistan . after the high court ordered a probe into an alleged barter of seven . girls to settle a blood feud in the Dera Bugti district of Baluchistan . province. A tribal council . of the prominent Bugi tribe ordered the barter in early September, the . district deputy commissioner, Saeed Faisal, told the court. The ages of . the girls have not been confirmed but local media reported they were . between 4 and 13 years old.

"October and November are usually the months when British women breathe a sigh of relief. The colder months and lack of beach time mean we can reach for that extra chocolate hobnob and hang up the razor. But sadly, the Gillette Venus won't be going into retirement just yet - there's a new trend for wearing bare legs all of the way through the winter months. Cara Delevingne and Victoria Beckham are pioneering the AW/14 fashion of tight-less legs, no matter how cold the weather gets. Here is Cara at The Face of an Angel' film premiere in London on October 18 . Stars like Victoria Beckham, Cara Delevingne and Suki Waterhouse are pioneering the new fashion for naked pins. Despite the weather taking a drastic dip in the last couple of weeks, there has barely been a single pair of opaque tights spotted on the legs of A-Listers in London and New York. It's a brave decision and not one to be made at the last minute - bare legs in late autumn require a number of preparations. They include round-the-clock taxis, streak-free tan, a spare pair of emergency socks and leggings and totally fuzz-free calves. Suki Waterhouse wore a warm leather jacket to walk the red carpet at the Love, Rosie film premiere in London on October 6, but decided against tights . The Femail desk are divided on the trend, so here two of the team give their reasons for and against in the battle of the winter hosiery: . 'It's all very well for models like Suki Waterhouse and Cara Delevingne to be wandering around London in November with their pins out, but this isn't an easy trend for us mere mortals. 'It's hard enough already to get out of bed on a November morning - a fifteen-minute trek to the tube with my calves bared to the wind and rain would mean the alarm clock never moved off snooze. 'It isn't just the comfort though, nothing slims the leg faster than some black hosiery, in fact, it favours curvier girls over stick insects. 'On top of that, they allow a girl to wear short skirts that would look extremely tarty if accompanied with acres of fleshy thigh. 'This is definitely a trend that is best left to stars and their monthly holidays abroad for tan top-ups, Dukan diets and chauffeur-driven limos. 'Finally, if it's good enough for the Duchess Of Cambridge, it's good enough for me.' 'Of course I wear tights. They are very practical. A cheap and easy way to stay warm and – more importantly – hide winter legs. 'And this is my problem with them. As well as being entirely unsexy, tights are lazy. They are the sartorial equivalent of scraping your hair back when you know you should have washed it but ran out of time. 'Which is fine every once in a while but they absolutely shouldn’t be a key part of your wardrobe in autumn/winter/whenever. 'Women with bare legs look more put together and definitely more stylish. You wouldn’t find Carine Roitfeld, Angelina Jolie or SJP rocking a bobbly opaque. 'The good news: going tightless doesn’t have to mean acres of bare legs for those of us without supermodel pins. Trousers, jeans, midi skirts = all acceptable non-tarty ways to not wear tights when the temperatures dip a bit. 'So there’s really no excuse to choose the easy (lazy) option every day of winter.' Alexa Chung has long been a fan of the bare leg. Here she is pictured at the Chanel fashion show on September 30 in Paris . Model Poppy Delevingne shares her sister Cara's penchant for a bare leg. Here she is at the A String of Naked Lightbulbs film premiere in London on October 28 . Taylor Swift has some of the longest legs in Showbiz and she likes to show them off. Here she is in New York on October 30 . Victoria Beckham shunned tights at a party in the Burberry shop in London last night . Model Hannah Dodd also wore a naked leg to last night's Burberry party, despite temperatures in the capital dropping to as low as five degrees . Jo Whiley also wore a naked leg last night - to the Music Industry Trust Awards . British model Charlotte Wiggins wore no tights to the Burberry party, along with a flat ankle boot. It is considered one of the hardest naked leg looks to pull off. Scarlett Johansson skipped the tights to join Eddie Redmayne for a private screening of 'The Theory Of Everything' in New York last night .","Cara Delevingne and Victoria Beckham are pioneering the AW/14 fashion .

"Thousands of people are being paid sickness benefits because they are too fat to work – at a cost to the taxpayer of £54million. Shocking figures show welfare payments for claimants with obesity-related illnesses have more than doubled in five years – highlighting the crisis blighting Britain. Almost 12,000 people received Disability Living Allowance last year because they have metabolic disease - the medical term for a combination of obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure. Too fat to work: Almost 12,000 people receive disability benefits because of metabolic disease -  a combination of obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure . The Department for Work and Pensions statistics show that the number of claimants with the condition has more than doubled from ariound 5,500 five years ago. Obesity is also a massive burden on the NHS and costs the health service more than £9billion a year. Ministers have been accused of failing to take proper action against the food industry to help the public by cutting calories in food and drink, and to help people make healthier choices. Some DLA claimants have jobs but the vast majority are out of work. Recipients can receive up to £138 a week. Tam Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘Successive governments have made life too easy for too many obese people. Jog on: Welfare payments for claimants with obesity-related illnesses have more than doubled in five years . ‘If the obese have a legitimate cause for their fatness - and there may be medical or genetic reasons - benefits should not be denied to them. But getting long-term benefits simply for over-eating is an insult to society.’ Andy Silvester, from the Taxpayers’ Alliance campaign group, said: ‘It’s crucial that every one of these claims is investigated to ensure it’s necessary.’ Julia Manning, from the think tank 2020health, said: ‘This obesity crisis in the West is a far worse health catastrophe than Ebola but there has been no government urgent action, even though we see the benefits bill spiralling.’ Chubby numbers: Obesity costs the NHS more than £9billion a year . But Jill Tipping, of the obesity support charity HOOP UK, said: ‘Obese people have an addiction to food. It’s an illness.’ Nearly one in five British secondary school pupils and a quarter of adults are obese, according to officials figures. Health experts predict that by 2050 the annual bill for obestity-related illnessed will have risen to £50billion a year, with almost two-thirds of the population obese. In one extreme case, Paul Mason, 51, who was once known as the fattest man in the world, had to give up his job as a postman when he became too huge to complete his delivery rounds. Mr Mason, of Ipswich, used to weigh 70 stone but shed a whopping 48 stone after gastric band surgery and now tips the scales at 22 stone . At the height of his weight problems he ate about 20,000 calories a day, weighed 70 stone, and needed a specially-built bungalow provided for him by the council. When Mr Mason became ill, firefighters had to knock down a wall in his house and use a forklift truck to get him to hospital. The Government has vowed to cut the welfare bill and began phasing out Disability Living Allowance in April and replacing it with the new Personal Independence Payment. Ministers also launched a Call to Action campaign in October 2011 in a bid to tackle obesity and reduce the nation’s calorie intake by 2020. The drive has called on the food and drink industry to play a key role in slashing the nation’s calorie consumption and encouraging families to eat healthily and enjoy active lifestyles. But senior doctors and academics want the Government to force food manufacturers to cut sugar levels, ensure products are clearly labelled and impose a tax on soft drinks. Public Health England, the Department of Health agency responsible for tackling obesity, has said it would ‘consider’ the ideas as part of a nine-month consultation process that will eventually report to ministers next spring. A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: ‘Just having a metabolic disease in itself is unlikely to qualify for DLA. But they could qualify if they have a physical or mental disability caused or made worse by it.’","Benefits claimants who are 'too fat to work' more than double in five years .

"Australian scientists appear to have solved one of the great mysteries of human biology - exactly what triggers labour after about 40 weeks of pregnancy. They cannot explain how the timing works or predict a child's birthday with greater accuracy. But they know that, when it's time, the body produces a protein, which releases a safety switch that allows the uterus to contract in a way that any stretched muscle should. Australian scientists have discovered a protein that triggers child birth at about 40 weeks of pregnancy . This could lead to new drugs to induce labour in overweight or obese women, as well as a way to prevent pre-term births, says Professor Shaun Brennecke from the University of Melbourne and Royal Women's Hospital. 'For decades, we have been looking at what might start human labour. This is the first clear-cut identification of that. 'Rather than all the hormonal changes which have been talked about in the past, this is the actual switch that starts labour,' said Prof Brennecke, who worked with colleagues at Monash University and the Hunter Medical Research Institute in Newcastle on the project. The study, which is published in the journal Nature Communications, is aimed at finding alternatives to the dangerous caesarean sections that are common among overweight and obese mothers. The finding could lead to the development of new drugs to induce labour in overweight or obese women and also to prevent pre-term births . Overweight mothers do not produce enough of the protein molecule to start the chain reaction, said study leader Professor Helena Parkington of Monash University. 'These women also respond poorly to our current methods of induction.' The study gives two potential options for improving the labour of obese women, says Prof Brennecke. There could be an existing drug that can switch off the safety mechanism, or there might be one that increases the amount of protein produced. A team from Monash University, pictured, worked with a team at Hunter Medical Research Institute in Newcastle on the project .","Australian scientists have determined a trigger for labour at 40 weeks .

"With Thibaut Courtois establishing himself as Jose Mourinho's No 1 at Chelsea, Petr Cech has had a bit more time on his hands recently. And the Czech Republic stopper seems to be using his spare hours to practice drumming along to his favourite bands. Cech, who has shown off his talent on the drums in the past, posted a video of himself playing along to the Foo Fighters 'Walk' to YouTube. Cech posted the video to his YouTube channel, playing along to a song by his favourite band the Foo Fighters . The Chelsea keeper is yet to start a Premier League games this season, after the arrival of Thibaut Courtois . Cech wrote: 'Drum cover of my favourite band ... it is not perfect but i wanted to do it in one take without correcting it.' The 32-year-old keeper, who played in a Czech music festival last summer, has said he would consider taking up music professionally when he retires from football. And, if this video is anything to go by, the Chelsea stopper has a real chance of making it once he decides to hang up his gloves. Cech has been limited to appearances in the Capital One Cup as Courtois has become Jose Mourinho's No 1 .

"The Midlands were wracked by an earthquake today - the biggest the region has felt in 13 years. The quake, rated 3.2 out of 10 on the Richter scale, hit at 7.07am and was felt up to 28 miles from the epicentre in the Melton Mowbray area of Rutland. However, it was not powerful enough to cause any damage. The earthquake hit at Melton Mowbray shortly after 7am this morning but could be felt as far afield as Wellingborough, 27 miles away . British Geological Survey (BGS) seismologist Davie Galloway said: 'It was quite widely felt but we probably get about three of these at this size somewhere in the UK each year. 'There was a 4.1 in Melton Mowbray in October 2001 - so this is the biggest in the region for 13 years.' Within half an hour of the quake striking, the BGS had received around 140 calls from people who had felt the tremors. According to the BGS, an earthquake has to reach a magnitude of 4.5 before it can be expected to do any damage. Emergency services have not reported any casualties or damage to property. Among . those who felt the tremor was former English rugby union player Austin . Healey. He tweeted: 'We've just had an earthquake in Oakham. The house . was shaking for about 10 secs.' Louise Warren, 40, was getting four year-old son Adam ready for school when it struck. Ms Warrwen, . of Stamford, Lincolnshire, said: 'The shaking sound started quite . suddenly and my electric toothbrush fell from the shelf into my sink. A British Geological Survey chart, showing the tremors as they hit Rutland, shortly after 7am . The spike can clearly be seen when the earthquake hits . 'It felt like a lorry going past my house but about ten times louder. There was a second shake soon after the first one stopped. 'I wasn't too scared because I remember when we had a tremor here about eight years ago. 'My . son was a bit frightened because he'd never felt anything like it . before. But he's a boy, so he did think it was pretty cool.' Sara Dodd, who is in Whissendine, tweeted that it 'felt like an explosion but without any sound.' Another resident - identified as Ali W - wrote on Twitter: 'It was different to the last one... A massive bang rather than a shake.' She added: 'I even thought a train had crashed at the back of us.' Dr John Park wrote: 'What the hell was that. Whole house shook about 7.07am! It was either an explosion or earthquake in Rutland. Anyone else feel it?' Special scientific equipment which measured the earthquake installed by the British Geological Survey . Kerry Rough tweeted: 'Woke me up. I thought the house was falling down.' Mr Galloway said: 'It has nothing to do with fracking. We record about 200 earthquakes and it is to do with the earth's dynamic plates moving, probably about the pace of the growth of a fingernail. 'The most common reports we have had is that houses shook, windows rattled for quite a few seconds, people were quite alarmed. Another comment was that it felt like a lorry was trundling along the road or there had been a crash but no one has reported cracking in their houses. 'We do not get the big earthquakes like they would get in places like Japan.' Police and the emergency services have reported no damage or casualties. The biggest earthquake in the UK was the 5.4-magnitude tremor which hit the Lleyn Peninsula in Wales in July 1984. In a close second place is the 2008 quake that shook Market Rasen, Lincolnshire and was measured at 5.2 .","3.2-magnitude quake hit Rutland at 7am and could be felt 27 miles away .

"Dakota Johnson got the job: She is to play Anastasia Steele in the film adaptation of the best-selling erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey . For most actresses, their next major role happens after a screen test in a Hollywood studio. For Dakota Johnson, it was all about what happened in a Los Angeles hotel room with a hunky British male star. The daughter of Hollywood royalty was there to try to win the role of protagonist Anastasia Steele in the film adaptation of the best-selling erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey. She was auditioning with Charlie Hunnam, 33, an actor better known for action roles, who had won the part of Ana’s love interest Christian Grey, a handsome young billionaire who whips women in his Red Room of Pain. According to reports Universal Studios had already filmed the 6ft 1in Hunnam with a series of young actresses, talking, kissing and according to one executive, ‘squeezing’ them. All the candidates were judged too passive. But Miss Johnson left the Los Angeles hotel room ten days ago with flying colours and appears to have passed what was demurely described as a ‘chemistry test’ set by Fifty Shades author EL James who was given a veto on all casting choices. What took place between Johnson and Hunnam in the hotel room remains a mystery, but British director Sam Taylor-Johnson is said to have pushed them to their limits ‘in every sense’. According to reports James had insisted the two actors should not only bring her characters to life  but should kindle the mutual passion that has helped to sell 70m copies of the Fifty Shades books worldwide. Miss James insists her trilogy is more about romance that the sadomasochistic antics of the protagonists which the books are now associated with. In recent months the roles of Ana and Christian have become the most sought-after in Hollywood and the $60m film is forecast to be the next year’s biggest adult film and act as a springboard to the A-List for its stars. However it has emerged that Miss Johnson’s family are said to be concerned that she is the only American in what is a very British affair – the director, writer and scriptwriter are all from London. Dakota Johnson, daughter of 'Miami Vice' star Don Johnson and Melanie Griffiths, left the hotel room after her 'chemistry test' with British actor Charlie Hunnam (right) When James announced the cast on Twitter last Monday it provoked fury. More than 50,000 people supported a petition demanding that both actors be sacked. Johnson was mocked as too edgy, bland, too fat, too thin and a ‘scavenger’ building a career on her family name. Her father is Don Johnson and mother is Melanie Griffiths who are both successful Hollywood stars. Miss Johnson, 23, is also a model and appeared in Facebook film The Social Network. She has said: ‘I’d watch my parents at work and say, yeah, this is what I want to do. ‘Maybe it is all I can do. I want to make people laugh and cry. And make my family happy. I know people will say that I have got it easy because of my family, but I have to prove myself every day. I am not going to go all Hollywood. I know what that is like.’ Hunnam, 33, from Newcastle, is known for shedding his clothes in controversial Channel 4 drama Queer as Folk. He was in sci-fi film Pacific Rim and also appeared on BBC children’s series Byker Grove. The Fifty Shades trilogy has made Miss James one of the world’s richest writer, with more than £60million according to Forbes.","Universal Studios had already filmed Hunnam with a series of young actresses .

"Jurgen Klinsmann watched this shambles play out from a comfy seat in the directors’ box at White Hart Lane. The temptation at half-time, when his beloved Tottenham trooped off 2-0 down to a chorus of boos, was to ask him to take charge after the break. Why wait? These days Klinsmann, who turned down the Spurs job last year in the build-up to the World Cup, is the USA’s head coach. That side, playing catch-up on Tottenham’s 132-year history, get the game better than the group of players allotted to Mauricio Pochettino. There will be another inquest at the training ground on Monday after Pochettino’s team slumped to their fourth home defeat in five Barclays Premier League matches. Tottenham legend and current USA manager Jurgen Klinsmann watched Sunday's clash at White Hart Lane . Erik Lamela (left) and Harry Kane (centre) show their despair as a chance goes begging near the final whistle . Bojan Krkic looks focused as he strikes the ball after six minutes to give visitors Stoke the lead against Spurs . Stoke were streets ahead: slick, organised, disciplined and focused — all the things Tottenham want to be. Doesn’t it hurt to be booed off at half-time? Isn’t it humiliating to be dragged off, as Christian Eriksen and Andros Townsend were, after just 45 minutes? ‘Tactical reasons,’ claimed Pochettino. Code for dreadful. Pochettino, who is struggling to make an impact at Spurs, added: ‘We need to find the solution and I need to change the mentality of the players. They know my feelings like I know their feelings. We feel the same, very disappointed and frustrated, and not happy because our performance wasn’t good enough. ‘It’s clear we need to improve a lot, and quickly. This is my challenge in the next few weeks.’ Stoke were rampant in the first half, taking the lead through the wriggling figure of Bojan Krkic and doubling their advantage when Jonathan Walters scored with a simple tap-in. The Spanish striker celebrates breaking his Stoke duck but Pochettino preferred to focus on the second goal . Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino (centre) looks apprehensive during another disappointing display . Chadli celebrates after his volley with 12 minutes to go halved Stoke's lead and gave Tottenham hope . Bar Nacer Chadli’s glorious volley at the back post 13 minutes from time, this was dreadful. There is no pattern to Tottenham’s play. We were promised one of the best coaches in world football, one of the most innovative in the Premier League, when Pochettino was head-hunted from Southampton. He doesn’t have the answers. To watch Emmanuel Adebayor delay his arrival as a substitute when his team were 2-0 down by changing his boots makes you feel sick. That is what the half-hour warm-up is for and the weather conditions hadn’t changed. Instead, the storm clouds are gathering at Spurs again. When they were chasing the game seven minutes from time, right back Kyle Naughton was dismissed for a foolish nudge on Victor Moses. So, to Stoke, and this glitzy performance. Bojan’s first goal in English football was excellent, coasting past Tottenham’s defence to lash the ball beyond Hugo Lloris. Can Bojan, once tipped to be better than Lionel Messi at Barcelona, do it on a wet, windy night in Stoke? That’s not so clear cut, but what we do know is that the little Spanish forward found White Hart Lane to his liking. The beauty of playing Tottenham is that they always give you a chance sooner or later. Referee Jones (second right) waves the red card and Naughton (left) is off down the tunnel . Stoke manager Mark Hughes admitted he had to be patient with Bojan, saying: ‘We are really pleased that he is finally coming to the fore. He started off like a house on fire when he joined us in pre-season, and people got a little bit carried away because we all felt it was going to take him time to adjust. ‘He has had the benefit of three or four months’ training at the intensity he needs and he looks a very accomplished player again.’ Even when Stoke were forced into a defensive reshuffle, they were untroubled throughout a first half dominated by Hughes’s side. Phil Bardsley succumbed to injury after nine minutes and was replaced by Geoff Cameron. Marc Wilson was substituted for Marc Muniesa after 26. Moments later, Stoke scored again. This Spurs defence needs sorting out because the goal Walters scored was too easy. Mame Diouf bounced through unchallenged into the danger zone and placed the ball into the path of Walters for the Stoke forward to finish the job. It was borderline embarrassing. Jon Walters makes it 2-0, but Pochettino complained 'it is not possible to make these mistakes' Mark Hughes celebrates his side's win at White Hart Lane after keeping faith in Bojan, and being rewarded . There are rumblings of discontent around these parts and it is becoming increasingly difficult to defend Pochettino. Even Harry Kane — ‘He’s one of our own,’ the Spurs fans sing — couldn’t get going as Stoke’s giant centre half Ryan Shawcross handled him impeccably. The kid hardly got a kick. Chadli gave Spurs hope when he picked the ball out of the air to beat Begovic with an angled volley, but the dismissal of Naughton confirmed the worst. Kane’s desperate late attempt to repeat his last-minute free-kick against Aston Villa last week was drilled straight at the wall. That was enough for Klinsmann and the rest of the US Soccer delegation, who made their excuses and left. Whether the German can face returning is another matter.","Tottenham legend Jurgen Klinsmann saw his former club lose to Stoke .

"A senior Conservative MP has helped fund a female lawyer who is suing a top City firm for £22 million after it fired her for writing a ‘bonkbuster’ novel based on her hedonistic lifestyle. Deidre Clark, who was sacked from her £130,000-a-year job after publishing the thinly veiled account of her escapades in Allen & Overy’s Moscow office, has been bankrolled by Tory MP David Mowat – who has also being asked to testify on her behalf as a character witness. Mr Mowat, a Commons aide to Treasury Minister Greg Clark, gave nearly £2,000 to Ms Clark to help her with the cost of leaving Russia after she was sacked for writing the book. Loan: Lawyer Deidre Clark, pictured left, has been given nearly £2,000 by Tory MP David Mowat, pictured right, to help her leave Russia after she was sacked from her £130,000-a-year job for writing a 'bonkbuster' about her escapades in teh Moscow office of City firm Allen & Overy . Allen & Overy – part of the ‘magic circle’ of top UK law firms – dismissed Ms Clark, 47, four years ago for ‘bringing the company into disrepute’ by publishing Expat, an explicit online account of champagne parties and sexual exploits among Westerners in Moscow. The romp, written under the name Deidre Dare and soon dubbed ‘Sexpat’, told the story of ‘Dasha’ as she snorted cocaine, compared the sexual performances of numerous men and turned up to work with crippling hangovers after nights spent in strip clubs. Ms Clark has countered by bringing an action against the company in New York for sexual harassment, discrimination and breach of contract, demanding damages of £22 million as compensation for  ‘20 lost years’ of future work. Mr Mowat, 55, MP for Warrington South, first met US citizen Ms Clark a decade ago when she was staying in London for a year as part of a round-the-world trip. Last night, Ms Clark said: ‘I am delighted to have such an eminent person backing me.’ Mr Mowat, a former partner with managing consultant Accenture, said: ‘I was quite matey with Ms Clark and her partner Mike, so I lent her some money to help her out. I hope she wins the case.’ He said he had been asked to act as a character witness in her legal action, but ‘in the circumstances’ had decided against doing so. A spokesman for Allen & Overy declined to comment.","Deidre Clark wrote about her .

"One Direction's Harry Styles has been having facials made of bird excrement in a bid to clear up his spotty skin before the band's world tour. The 20-year-old singer is said to have signed up for an intensive course of the anti-wrinkle and acne treatment - in which clients pay £180 to have nightingale droppings smeared on to their skin. The unusual 'Geisha facial' is already popular in Hollywood, with Tom Cruise and Victoria Beckham among those who swear by its effectiveness. One Direction's Harry Styles has been having facials made of bird excrement in a bid to clear up his spotty skin before the band's world tour . A source said that Harry fears that the heavy make-up and hot lights used on tour could take their toll on his young skin - which is already prone to spots . Unusual: The anti-ageing treatment made from nightingale droppings . A new anti-wrinkle treatment is on the market in which clients pay £180 to have nightingale droppings smeared on to their skin . The Daily Star reports that Harry fears that the heavy make-up and hot lights used on tour could take their toll on his young skin - which is already prone to spots. A source told the paper that his skin was already looking better after he embarked on the daily course of facials. Tom Cruise, 51, started the treatments two years ago, and also believes they have dramatically improved his complexion. Other fans include Victoria Beckham, 40, who began having the facials after a visit to Japan. Billed as an alternative to Botox injections, the droppings – which are collected on the Japanese island of Kyushu – are mixed with rice bran and water before being applied as a mask and left to soak into the pores for an hour. They contain enzymes which are said to break down dead skin – restoring complexions that have been damaged by ageing and sun exposure – and were traditionally used to help Japanese geisha remove the thick white make-up they were expected to wear. Hollywood actor Tom Cruise is among those who swear by its effectiveness . The mixture apparently does not smell of excrement, but is said to have a musty odour  - similar to hay. Emma Hu, director of the Spa to You centre at the Hilton Hotel on London's Park Lane, which has recently started offering the treatment,  said: 'The nightingales were fed on caterpillars that eat from plum trees. 'Clients are intrigued, but after the hour-long treatment users say it gives a shimmery, iridescent effect to the skin.'","Unusual facial popular in Hollywood - actor Tom Cruise swears by it .

He almost single-handedly led Argentina to the World Cup in 1986 in Mexico and lifted the trophy proudly . 'I thank you for what you did with mine... Happy Birthday Diego !!!' Widely considered to rank alongside Brazilian Pele in the list of all-time greats, Maradona almost single-handedly won the 1986 World Cup for Argentina and two Serie A titles for un-fancied Italian side Napoli. In a glittering playing career, Maradona appeared in a second World Cup final in 1990 - when Argentina lost to West Germany - and scored 34 goals in 91 appearances for his nation between 1977 and 1994. He also won the Argentina Primera Division with both Argentinos Juniors and Boca Juniors, as well as the UEFA Cup with Napoli and a Copa del Rey with Barcelona. With an incredible 312 goals in 588 club games, Maradona was so much more than an archetypal No 10. Maradona coached his compatriot Osvaldo when he was Argentina manager between 2008 and 2010 .

He was also sent home from the 1994 World Cup in the USA after failing a drugs test for ephedrine doping and he was addicted to cocaine for more than 20 years.

"For a team who only narrowly missed out on the Premier League title last May and spent more than £100million on new players in the summer, sitting 11th in the table after 11 games of the season is simply unacceptable. That's the situation facing Liverpool and manager Brendan Rodgers after a 2-1 defeat against Chelsea on Saturday - already their fifth loss of the campaign - left the Reds in the bottom half below Everton and Manchester United. But far more concerning than sitting underneath their great rivals is the gap between themselves and league leaders Chelsea. Victory for Jose Mourinho's men at Anfield took them 15 points clear of Steven Gerrard and Co and the gap looks certain to increase. Liverpool stars (from left to right) Joe Allen, Rickie Lambert and Steven Gerrard look dejected against Chelsea . Manager Brendan Rodgers shakes hands with Emre Can during his side's 2-1 defeat by Chelsea on Saturday . Chelsea striker Diego Costa (second from right) blasts home his side's winner at Anfield . Games played (all competitions): 17 . Wins: 7 (One on penalties) Draws: 2 . Defeats: 8 . Goals conceded: 24 . Goals scored: 20 . At the same stage last season, Rodgers had led his side to second place in the table, had beaten David Moyes' United side and had seven wins. But having already lost to the likes of Newcastle and West Ham this time around, Liverpool are nine points off the pace they set last term. Perhaps even more worrying for fans of a red persuasion is an unwelcome comparison to Roy Hodgson's unsuccessful spell as boss during the 2010-11 season. After working wonders at Fulham, Hodgson arrived to oversee an Anfield revolution but ended up being sacked just over six months into his three-year contract. Despite his failings - both in the transfer market and on the pitch - the ex-Inter Milan manager actually managed to accumulate more points after 11 fixtures than Rodgers has now. Hodgson masterminded a 2-0 win over Chelsea and respectable 1-1 draw with Arsenal during Liverpool's start to the 2010-11 campaign, earning 15 points, leaving them in ninth spot in the table.

Liverpool players react after Gary Cahill's equaliser in front of the Kop at Anfield on Saturday . Liverpool had a better record under Roy Hodgson in the 2010-11 season than they do under Rodgers this term . But having failed to win any of their last three top-flight clashes, Rodgers' side have only 14 points and are below West Ham, Stoke, Swansea and high-flying Southampton. They haven't fared much better in Europe either, having made their return to Champions League action following a five-year absence brought about by below-par performances in the Premier League. Two defeats by Real Madrid - the second of which came at the Bernabeu after Rodgers decided to rest seven first-team players - and another away at Basle means Liverpool have now lost eight games in all competitions this season - the same amount as in the whole 2013-14 season (43 games). Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema (right) celebrates after scoring his side's winning goal against Liverpool . Steven Gerrard, Glen Johnson and Jordan Henderson (left to right) started on the bench at the Bernabeu . Their soft defence and lacklustre attack has left their hopes of reaching the knockout stages hanging by a thread, with wins against the Swiss side and Bulgarians Ludogorets almost certainly required if they're to reach the last 16. As well as needing his back four to tighten-up considerably, Rodgers also needs his attack to become more potent - and fast - if Liverpool are to turn around their nightmare start. The Reds have scored just three goals in their last six games in all competitions, with Emre Can's strike against Chelsea coming courtesy of a hefty deflection. They failed to find the back of the net in four of those games. Injured striker Daniel Sturridge watches from the stands at Anfield as Liverpool lose to Chelsea .

Sturridge is set to return against Crystal Palace after the international break as Rodgers' men aim to gain a measure of revenge on the Eagles following their capitulation at Selhurst Park at the end of last season. Fail to take three points in south London and Rodgers' record this season will be even worse than Hodgson's was four years ago. Time will tell if the same fate befalls him.","Liverpool lost 2-1 to Chelsea on Saturday and are now 11th in the table .

"The fighter who calls himself ‘The Alien’ is human after all. Two months shy of his 50th birthday, Bernard Hopkins was well beaten by Sergey Kovalev who later advised the ring legend to call a halt to his illustrious 26-year career. Hopkins was knocked down in the first round and lost every subsequent session of this light-heavyweight unification clash. Scroll down for video . Sergey Kovalev knocked down Bernard Hopkins in the first round on his way to a comprehensive victory . Hopkins falls to the canvas in the opening stages after being caught by a right hand to the top of the head . Hopkins hits the canvas in the opening session but withstood some tough moments to hear the final bell . Hopkins, nicknamed 'The Alien' made his typical entrance to the ring, but it may well have been his last . ‘He had a good game plan, he was nice and rangy,’ said Hopkins. ‘He fought a great technical fight. He has patience and every time he got hit he did the right thing and stepped back. ‘He’s going to be around a long time and I’ve got respect for someone who wants to fight the best. 'I really don't want to say anything [about his future]. It's been 50-50 for the last nine years.' Hopkins, 18 years his opponent’s senior, won his first world title when Kovalev was just 12. By the time the Russian turned professional 14 years later, Hopkins had already ruled the middleweight division for a decade. Prior to Saturday night, Hopkins had boxed 494 rounds, more than five times as many as Kovalev. And Father Time finally caught up with the Philadelphia native who clung on during a torrid final round to avoid the first stoppage defeat of his career. ‘He was a really tough opponent,’ said Kovalev. He is very good at keeping the distance. I have a lot of respect for him but he needs to stop his career. ‘He needs to give opportunities to younger guys to be champions. ‘I wanted to show my fans that I can box; I tried to knock him out but he has great defence.’ Kovalev hit the deck but only after a shove from Hopkins who struggled to cope against the younger man . Hopkins ships a right hand from Kovalev, a pattern that was quickly established and continued throughout . Kovalev controlled the distance well, not allowing Hopkins on to the front foot and nullifying his attack . Hopkins lands a rare punch on Kovalev who was able to keep himself out of range over the 12 rounds . More than 8,000 fans packed into the famed Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, just a four-minute drive from the venue for Hopkins’ first professional fight – a defeat – in 1988. Since then, Hopkins has proved himself a master at picking the right opponent at the right time to become the sport's oldest-ever world champion. That followed a four-year stint as the undisputed middleweight king and a decade-long reign as the holder of at least one of the multiple belts. Felix Trinidad, Oscar De La Hoya, Antonio Tarver, Roy Jones Jnr and Kelly Pavlik were among those swept aside. Our own Joe Calzaghe’s Las Vegas triumph over the Executioner-cum-Alien in 2008 looked more impressive with every subsequent win. But on this occasion, Hopkins’ timing was out. Kovalev, who grew up in poverty in north-east Russia, was one step too far. Hopkins looked composed between rounds despite the fact he was being comprehensively beaten . Towards the end, Hopkins looked resigned to defeat as he sat slumped on his stool inbetween rounds . Fifteen months ago, he destroyed Welshman Nathan Cleverly in four brutal rounds in Cardiff to win the WBO title. It was a particularly sweet victory given the three years he spent at the beginning of his career fighting for free as he tried to make his way in America. He will be paid handsomely for this victory which adds the IBF and WBA belts to his collection. The tone was set from the first bell as Hopkins was backed up on the ropes. He took a right to the top of the head which, along with a slight slip, sent him to the canvas. From then on, Kovalev controlled the contest, proving he is more than a knock-out artist. It wasn’t until the seventh round that Hopkins landed anything of significance but even that didn’t win him the session on the judges’ cards which read 120-107 twice and 120-106. And the concluding three minutes were hard to watch. Kovalev set about trying to finish off the elder statesman while the referee hovered, perhaps a little too keen to preserve Hopkins’ record of always hearing the final bell. Thirty eight punches reigned in, more than in any round of any of Hopkins' previous 41 fights tracked by data analysts CompuBox. But make it he did. Perhaps for the final, final time. Kovalev went on the attack in the final round in an attempt to be the first man to stop Hopkins . Hopkins came under incredible pressure towards the end of the fight but managed to take Kovalev the distance .

'But when the time is right we, as a team and a club, will give the man the tribute and recognition he deserves; I know the supporters will want to say thank you to someone who has served them with such distinction for so long.' And Roy Hodgson paid tribute to the 'model professional', backing him to be among the coaching ranks soon. 'Having worked with Jamie Carragher, it was always evident that he was a model professional who gave everything he had for club and country,' said the England boss, who had a brief spell at Anfield in 2010. 'He has had a fantastic career and will always be looked on very fondly by everyone associated with Liverpool Football Club. 'It was good to see him back in the team recently. I hope that between now and the end of the season he is able to add to his great total of appearances for the club. 'After retirement, I am sure he will march quickly up the coaching ladder and become one of the country's top young coaches.' Liverpool managing director also heaped praise on the 2005 European champion, adding: 'It . speaks volumes about Jamie's selfless nature that even the manner of . this announcement is putting the team and the club before himself. It's . what he's done throughout his entire career. 'He told me he didn't want the manager . or myself fending off questions regarding his future when he had already . made his decision.

Liver legends: Carragher (right) with Gerarrd watching Liverpool in  Champions League action in 2007 . 'In line with Jamie's wishes we will wait until the season concludes before giving him the true recognition he deserves. We will also wait until that time to comment further regarding what involvement he may have with the club going forward.' England boss Roy Hodgson, who has worked with Carragher at Anfield, also praised the departing defender. He said: 'Having worked with Jamie Carragher it was always evident that he was a model professional who gave everything he had for club and country,” said Hodgson. 'He has had a fantastic career and will always be looked on very fondly by everyone associated with Liverpool Football Club. 'It was good to see him back in the team recently, I hope that between now and the end of the season he is able to add to his great total of appearances for the club. 'After retirement I am sure he will march quickly up the coaching ladder and become one of the country’s top young coaches.' Sportsmail columnist and former team-mate of Carragher, Jamie Redknapp, described the Liverpool defender as an 'icon of the Premier League'. 'People always talk about you being a long time retired, but Jamie must know it's the right time to do it for his family and we have to respect that,' Redknapp said. 'Jamie's been thinking about this for a while now and his career and when is the right time to decide. The career that he's had, he's an absolute icon of the Premier League and for Liverpool and they are going to miss him. 'Only Jamie knows his body. He's the only person who knows what it's like day-in, day-out, how he recovers after a game. He'll be looking at it and think the right time is the end of the season and then he will look at his options. 'Maybe management, in the media - when he did the World Cup coverage he was exceptional. He's a real student of the game and watches every single football match on television so that's something he might want to do. He has many, many options. Speaking to Sky Sports News, Redknapp added: 'He's worked so hard at his game and the extra training he did behind the scenes and in the gym. The young players now look at all the trimmings but he is a good person to analyse for the dedication he's put in and the rewards he's got now. 'He won't want any fuss whatsoever, that's the last thing he likes. Brendan Rodgers will know he will get him 100 per cent until the end of the season.'

"Spiders are growing far larger in the city than in rural environments, researchers have said. They found that rather than thriving in areas with lots of vegetation, golden orb weaver spiders living in urban areas of Sydney, Australia, were larger and had more babies. The say city an abundance of food and city lights could be to blame. City-dwelling orb-weaving spiders grow larger and could produce more offspring than their country cousins, researchers say. Golden orb weaver spiders, known as Nephila plumipes, are found in Queensland in Australia, Indonesia and some Pacific islands. They are characterised by bright, vibrantly coloured abdomens and produce webs up to one metre, which appear a golden colour. Females are often three or four times larger than males and, although they do have venom. they are usually harmless. 'City-dwelling orb-weaving spiders grow larger and could produce more offspring than their country cousins our research shows,' said Elizabeth Lowe of the University of Sydney, who led the research. This study shows invertebrates are sensitive to urbanisation but that not all species are negatively affected by living in cities. 'Our findings show the impact urbanisation can have on local wildlife. 'While many species do not survive encroaching urbanisation and the consequent loss of native habitat, others have a more complex relationship with man-made changes to the landscape.' The researchers collected golden orb-weaving spiders (Nephila plumipes) from across the Sydney city region. The spiders are abundant on Australia's coast in both urban and natural environments and, once matured, remain in the same location for the rest of their lives. 'We quantified the degree of urbanisation of 20 sites then looked at changes in the spiders' body size, fat reserves and ovary weight,' Ms Lowe said. The results show spiders in areas with more vegetation cover had smaller bodies and larger bodies when located in urbanised areas, characterised by increased housing and population density and hard surfaces such as roads and buildings. The authors also found that the spiders' reproductive ability, measured by increased ovary weight, appeared to increase in urban areas. The spiders are particularly fond of Tamarama Beach, Sydney's eastern suburbs, just a km away from Bondi . 'Two reasons likely to explain the differences between these spiders in urban and non-urban environments are temperature and prey availability. 'Hard surfaces and lack of vegetation lead to the well-known 'urban heat island' effect with more heat retained than in areas with continuous vegetation. Higher temperature is associated with increased growth and size in invertebrates. University of Sydney ecologist Lizzy Lowe found that spiders thrive in Sydney's rich suburbs . 'Urban lighting also may be a contributing factor as it attracts insects and means more food for spiders in those environments. 'This increase in prey would result in bigger, heavier, more fecund spiders. The study, published in the journal PLOS One, examined 222 spiders collected between April and June 2012. Researchers wrote: 'Habitat modifications significantly alter species distributions and can result in increased abundance of select species which are able to exploit novel ecosystems. 'Spider size was negatively associated with vegetation cover at a landscape level, and positively associated with hard surfaces and anthropogenic disturbance on a local and microhabitat scale. 'The larger size and increased reproductive capacity of the spider in urban areas show that some species benefit from the habitat changes associated with urbanisation.' The research found the largest golden orb weighed three grams, and their webs can measure up to three metres. The smaller spiders were found in rural sites such as the Brisbane Waters National Park, near the Central Coast - north of Sydney, where the smallest measured 0.5 grams.","The research was conducted by PhD student Lizzie Lowe from the University of Sydney .

"England's players were treated to a feature of life in Australia as a kangaroo hopped past them on their way to training. Steve McNamara's side are preparing to take on Australia in Sunday's Four Nations clash, and as they headed down for a training session on the Gold Coast the marsupial skipped past them on the path. Former Great Britain winger Martin Offiah, meanwhile, believes England's next opponents are 'there for the taking'. The Kangaroo skips past England's players on the path as they headed down for a training session . The Kangaroos are on the brink of failing to reach the final of a major international tournament for the first time since 1954 following their surprise 30-12 defeat by New Zealand in Brisbane and Offiah says England will go into Sunday's crunch clash in Melbourne full of confidence following their hard-fought 32-26 win over Samoa. England are looking to emulate the Great Britain team of 1992 that beat the Australians in the Victorian capital and Offiah, who scored the try that wrapped up a 33-10 victory at Melbourne's Princes Park, is excited by their prospects. 'I think if anything England will go into this game on a higher note than we went into that game,' said Offiah, the former Widnes and Wigan flier who won 33 caps from 1988-94. 'We had lost the first Test and, although we had played well in Sydney, no one would have predicted that we would have beaten the Australians by a record score. 'That team had some fantastic players in it and it was a great night for British and English rugby league, even if I scored the final try from a forward pass from Garry Schofield. South Sydney Rabbitohs' Tom Burgess and Catalan Dragons' Elliot Whitehead wrestle during training . 'But Steve McNamara's team will go into Sunday's game with a bit more confidence I believe. I thought they were pretty good against Samoa.' McNamara, who was a player on that 1992 Lions tour, is still hoping to have skipper Sean O'Loughlin back for Sunday's match despite naming a team without him and Offiah says his availability would add to England's strength. 'I was very impressed by the big English pack on Saturday,' Offiah said. 'I thought James Graham led from the front as he always does and the Burgess brothers had fantastic games and showed there is life after Sam Burgess. 'Michael Shenton has resurrected his Super League and international career after things didn't go well for him at St Helens. I thought he played well and I thought the two hookers were impressive but it's probably easy to play well when you've got such a big pack to lead you around the field. England's players look during a training session at Sanctuary Cove, they face Australia on Sunday . 'I also thought Matty Smith played like a world-class half-back. He got rave reviews from all the Aussie commentators. You wouldn't think this was a guy making his international debut at the ripe old age of 27.' By their own admission, England will need to improve defensively from their opening game and Offiah would also like to see more attacking flair from their outside backs. 'I'd like to see a bit more of our back three, that's where we've been strong in recent years, with the likes of Josh Charnley, Ryan Hall and Sam Tomkins,' Offiah said. 'They call Ryan Hall the world's best winger but he's turning into the world's biggest winger at the moment. I wouldn't like to see him get any bigger than he actually is now. If he gets the ball close to the line, he's going to be pretty hard to stop.' James Graham stretches as he warms up for the training session on Australia's Gold Coast . Australia, forced to field five debutants against the Kiwis, will have to make further changes following the injury to half-back Daly Cherry-Evans and Offiah believes they are under mounting pressure to avoid another defeat. 'They lost quite handsomely to New Zealand, who played fantastically well,' he said. 'Admittedly, there were about 11 changes from the team that won the Anzac Test so they're doing it a little bit tough. 'This Australian team are there for the taking. I don't know the last time they last lost back-to-back Test matches against different nations but I think the statisticians are saying the last time they failed to appear in a final was back in the fifties so there is a lot of pressure on Australia. 'I'm sure that the press are making them well aware of the fact they need to beat England.'","England face Australia on November 2 in Four Nations clash .

"Customers could soon design their own items, go into a supermarket and have them printed in 3D, if an ambitious major project by Tesco succeeds. The high street retail giant is working on developing new technology for a variety of products in its stores. Ideas include digitally making clothing, furniture, personal gifts and even food in their shops. The supermarket giant is keen to use new technologies to offer a wider range of products to consumers. Company researchers believe 3D printers are a natural progression given that they already offer photo and poster printing . The project could also see Tesco stores repair broken items or print spare parts for a product that has already been purchased. Paul Wilkinson, a lead research specialist with Tesco, revealed the retail giant’s ambitions writing a blog post on tesco.com about the potential of 3D printing. He said: '3D printing] could revolutionise the way we view stores and what we can get from them.' Wilkinson, who is heading on a fact-finding mission to San Francisco with a team from Tesco, added in The Grocer magazine: 'We already print photos and posters in many of our larger stores, so why not other gifts and personalised items? 'How about letting kids design their own toys and then actually being able to get them made? What if we had a digital catalogue of spare parts for items that you’d bought? 3D printing is burgeoning industry with all manner of objects, such as this gun, now being created. 'They could be printed on demand and ready for you by the time you’d finished your shopping. You could even take a broken item into store; we could scan it in 3D, repair it digitally and make you a new one. 'There’s been a lot of buzz recently. It’s great that we have one of the machines to test out and to be able to look at how they might change the way stores work.' He said the Tesco team would be meeting “some of the big names and getting together with lots of start-ups and trying to find that idea or product that might just change the retail world.' This is not the first time 3D technology has attracted headlines after it was revealed recently a printed gun had been digitally made.  The blueprints for the gun were then posted on a website and downloaded over 100,000 times. The Mail on Sunday also printed their own gun and demonstrated how easy it was to get it through immigration and security.","Paul Wilkinson, a lead research specialist with the supermarket, revealed 3D printing ambitions on a blog post for tesco.com .

"Emmanuel Adebayor has launched an extraordinary attack on Tottenham supporters and claimed the players are no longer made to feel welcome at White Hart Lane. Adebayor, who took an extra minute to come on as a substitute in the 2-1 defeat by Stoke because he decided to change his boots when he was waiting to get on, insists the atmosphere is negative. The Tottenham forward, who went on to say that the fans should show him more respect for everything he has done in his career, said: ‘When you are playing in front of your own crowd you want them to support you, but now it is like going through a sad moment and your family not welcoming you home. Striker Emmanuel Adebayor has launched a scathing attack on the Tottenham Hotspur supporters . Adebayor said players would rather be away from home after fans opted to boo during the defeat by Stoke . Mauricio Pochettino's Spurs were embarrassed by Ryan Shawcross (No 17) and Stoke at White Hart Lane . During the defeat by Stoke on Sunday, misplaced passes after 20 minutes were met with jeers as the Spurs faithful made their dissatisfaction known. On their way to a fourth home defeat of the season, the players were booed off at half-time and fans had a few choice words for chairman Daniel Levy and technical director Franco Baldini. And on Mike Jones' final whistle, music blasted out of the stadium speakers in an attempt to mask the full-time boos. It didn't work. ‘That’s the worst thing ever because you have nowhere to go. At the moment I don’t know whether we should play at home or whether we should play away. ‘(At Hull their next game) At least you know I am going to be having the majority of opposition fans booing me rather than our own fans booing me. And I am not just talking about me, I am speaking on behalf of all the players. ‘I think it might be better to play away from home at the moment because at least we know beforehand we are guaranteed to be booed because they want their home club to win. ‘But when you are playing at home and your own fans start booing you after a few minutes then it is harder. ‘So instead of booing people, which will make it even worse, I think it is sometimes better to support them and give them what they need to perform on the pitch. ‘And right now, to tell you the truth, I think a lot of players when they put on the shirt and go out on to the pitch, are finding it hard in the head. Obviously I have been through a lot in life so I am used to it. The Tottenham supporters (pictured observing a minute's silence) turned up in their droves to watch the defeat . Central defender Younes Kaboul leads out his Tottenham team at White Hart Lane ahead of Hugo Lloris . ‘Obviously I was on the bench against Stoke and, though I could not see everything as clear as night, I could see that nobody wanted the ball. It’s hard for the players. ‘It’s not their fault and it’s not the fans’ fault either because the fans want to see a result, the fans want to see a response and things are not going our way at the moment. We just have to fight as a team and as a club to find a solution. The quicker the better.’ The players were booed off the pitch at half-time when Mauricio Pochettino’s team were 2-0 down against Mark Hughes’ side. Adebayor tried his luck with a late header against Stoke but it wasn't to be for the Tottenham striker . Pochettino has struggled for results since taking over from Tim Sherwood in the summer . Adebayor, axed for the clash with Stoke after his half-hearted performance against Aston Villa the previous weekend, added: ‘To be honest, I don’t know where to start from. At the moment, and I’m not going to exclude myself, we are not playing good. We have to take it from there. ‘I want some of the players to be confident starting with me. Obviously when I am trying my best and making runs and things are not happening and I am not making things happen like I used to, the criticism comes so quickly. ‘I think in football too many people forget so quickly what you have done. ‘It’s kind of hard when you know the first bad ball you make, the fans are going to boo you. For 13 years now I’ve been a professional and I’ve had to deal with that stick everywhere I’ve been to. ‘If I make a mistake it doesn't mean I’m lazy. I will always try my best. ‘But the funny thing in football is, when you score two goals everyone is like “Wow, he’s back on form and back to his best”. But that’s not the point. Even when things aren’t going my way I am still trying the same, running around, wanting the ball, jumping to head it and looking to play my football. ‘But now because I have missed a couple of chances, people are like “Whoa, he is not trying and shouldn't be in the first team”. ‘As a footballer you have to deal with those things, but it does make you laugh.' Adebayor insists Pochettino has the backing of the players inside the dressing room, despite their fourth defeat at White Hart Lane in the Barclays Premier League. Pochettino has admitted he is under pressure to get results after a disastrous start to his career in charge of the club. The Tottenham Hotspur players jump in unison during the warm up, but were beaten by the Potters . The home support had something to cheer when Nacer Chadli pulled a goal back for Tottenham . Adebayor wasn’t exactly primed for battle when Mauricio Pochettino called on him to fire up Spurs’ strikeforce against Stoke. The substitute took an extra minute to get on the pitch because he decided to change his boots. Still only five goals in his last 22 games ... Adebayor added: ‘Obviously all managers bring their own philosophies, the way they see football, the way they see games and everything. ‘But come on, this is the third or fourth manager in two or three years so we just have to stop it now being about the manager. He’s a good manager and we just have to find a way so that we can try to understand what he wants to tell us and how he wants us to play and put that on the pitch. ‘If every player could do what the manager wants then we would win the Champions League. But at the moment we are not getting the message. To me, he is a good manager and a good man – we just have to get what he is telling us. ‘We have to get used to him. He is the new manager and it is tough. Tactically, he is working hard, he is trying to make us understand what the opponents will try to do and what we have to do to score goals and win the games. Bojan Krkic scored the opening goal for Stoke as they went away to Tottenham and beat Pochettino's side . Jon Walters added a second for the Potters as they clinched all three points in north London . Spurs have lost four Premier League home matches in five for the first time since May-October 2008 (Juande Ramos’ last five home PL games as manager). Spurs 0-3 Liverpool; Spurs 0-1 West Brom; Spurs 1-2 Newcastle; Spurs 1-2 Stoke . ‘But at the moment there is a blockage somewhere. Hopefully we can overcome that. Football is a funny game, like I said. You play one game and score one goal and everybody says ""Hey, things have changed for you"". ‘Maybe we can go out and win the next game 3-0 or 4-0 and that will be it – the fans will be back enjoying Tottenham again and we will have it like it was when I first came here on loan. ‘Then every weekend I was happy to come in and play for the club because I knew I was going to have fun and enjoy it. Now it is not fun anymore. ‘The critics are there and I welcome them – I take them in a good way and hopefully I will do my talking on the pitch. At the moment things are not going our way, but it cannot go any lower than this. Things can only get better. ‘Of course. We have a new manager and I think he is a good manager. Hopefully his preparations and message will come across quickly. We as players are trying to do what he tells us. ‘If we do this then I think we will be a good team because he loves playing from the back and attacking but now we are going through a difficult moment, which everyone should respect. That’s all I will say.'","Mauricio Pochettino's Spurs lost against Stoke City on Sunday .

"The woman who was dramatically photographed as she was beaten stripped and beaten senseless by Egyptian soldiers does not want to come forward because she is ashamed by her treatment. Footage and stills of the woman being beaten to the ground, kicked and stamped on as her hijab was torn off in Tahrir Square have made front page news around the world. Moments earlier, she had been struck countless times on the head and body with metal batons by a ten-strong mob before losing consciousness and slumping to the floor. Shocking: The defenceless woman had her hijab virtually torn off as she was kicked and stamped on by Egyptian military police . Soldiers then continued the assault, revealing her bra after her abaya was virtually pulled off during the assault. Hassan Mahmoud, a journalist for the newspaper Al Badeel, was near the woman as she stumbled and was then set upon by military police. He told The Guardian: 'They wanted to take her away from us but then a few brave protesters came in and started hurling stones and that was the one thing that saved her from their hands.' The unnamed woman was treated for hand and leg injuries, before she was taken home where she is said to have been left feeling wretched after her ordeal. Veteran: A soldier shoves a wooden baton towards the throat of Khadiga al-Hennawy during protests in the capital . Violence: She is then drag along by her arm before being kicked and beaten with the batons . Mr Mahmoud said she told him: 'It doesn't matter if I talk [to the media] or not, their stripping me is enough to reveal them and tell enough to those who still believe them.' Mohamed Zeidan, who filmed the shocking beating from a balcony overlooking Tahrir Square, said he stopped recording out of fear of being discovered. 'The army were like vultures who found a prey,' he said. 'The soldiers even beat an older couple who tried to help her up.' Another video shows soldiers assaulting an old woman as clashes erupted between protesters and security forces. Khadiga al-Hennawy can be seen being dragged by the hair by two officers, before being kicked and beaten around the arms and back with batons. Known as the 'mother of revolutionaries' because she has taken part in several protests against the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. Crackdown: A young protesters receives treatment to a head wound near Tahrir Square, Cairo, yesterday . Clashes: Protesters brave water cannons during a stand off in the square. A total of 14 people have been killed in four days of violent demonstrations . Hundreds of soldiers wearing riot gear have today carried out further sweeps through Cairo's Tahrir Square and opened fire on protesters demanding an end to military rule. The Health Ministry said at least three people were killed - bringing the death toll for four days of violent clashes to 14. Clashes have been raging in the capital since Friday, when military forces guarding the Cabinet building near the square cracked down on a three-week sit-in to demand ruling generals immediately hand over power to a civilian authority. The raid may have been an attempt by the military to keep protesters away from key government buildings near the square, including parliament and the Interior Ministry - in charged of the police force. Uprising: Protesters are demanding the the military council in Egypt hands over power to a civilian authority amid concerns they could refuse to cede control . Victims: Two boys show ammunition, including bullets and tear gas canisters, used during the clashes . A member of the ruling military council defended the use of force, and argued the events amounted to an attempt to 'topple the state'. Major General Adel Emara said: 'There is a methodical and prepared plot to topple the state, but Egypt will not fall. 'What are we supposed to do when protesters break the law? Should we invite people from abroad to govern our nation?' The military council took power 10 months ago after the popular uprising forced longtime president Hosni Mubarak to step down. It has routinely denied the use of excessive force by its troops against protesters, including clashes last month that left more than 40 people dead. Islamist parties won the largest share of the vote in the first round of parliament elections. Stricken: A blood-soaked protesters is carried away by comrades during clashes.

"When Kolo Toure's name was included on the Liverpool team-sheet, their supporters could have been forgiven for being apprehensive. After all, the increasingly error-prone centre half was up against Cristiano Ronaldo, one goal away from becoming the joint-highest Champions League scorer ever, Karim Benzema and James Rodriguez. And despite a couple of wobbles, Toure coped excellently, throwing himself in front of the ball and denying Ronaldo his moment of glory (or, as Twitter put it, having the Portugal star 'in his pocket'). Kolo Toure gets away from James Rodriguez and goes on a barnstorming run down the wing . Toure throws himself in the way of a Cristiano Ronaldo shot as he nullified the Real Madrid star's threat . The highlight of his performance was a barnstorming run down the left wing which brought back memories of his time as one of Arsenal's Invincibles. After the game, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers praised his defender,saying: 'Kolo Toure was excellent. Tonight gives me great food for thought.' Twitter predictably went wild with virals after Toure's performance and here,Sportsmail have compiled the 10 best reactions. One tweet mocked James Rodriguez's performance against Toure, using a picture from the World Cup . This tweet insinuated that Cristiano Ronaldo was in Toure's back pocket for the match . Carlo Ancelotti is supposedly asking the question, 'Where is Ronaldo?'... needless to say, Toure answers . One tweet (misspelling Bernabeu) likened Toure's performance to that of a tank, not letting anything past him . After this 'competition' was tweeted, there were predictably thousands more retweets than favourites . A Twitter account dedicated to Yaya Toure took a night to support his brother Kolo . The Sport Bible's Twitter account compared Toure to a brick wall . This funny picture noted that Ronaldo is currently lost in Toure's back pocket . Toure celebrates as yet another tweet claims that Ronaldo is missing, last seen in his back pocket . This picture uses a famous clip from a Simpsons episode to depict Toure's successful night .

'The memorial at the Tower of London was pretty amazing, we couldn’t believe it when we saw it, so to be just a few steps away from there and doing your part was pretty humbling. 'I think I made the most money on the day because I’m so tall – and everyone was attracted to my smile of course – and it was fun to meet with people from London and the UK, do some good work and get to tell them about ourselves a bit as well.' Marks added: 'We had a good time out there, getting out in the sun and meeting the public. It was funny getting asked by so people who we were and what we were doing but we got a lot of love. 'And it was fantastic when we had people coming up to us and saying ‘good luck Sunday’ and things like that. We weren’t expecting that but it is a great feeling to know we are building fans in London as well.

"The celebration in San Francisco's streets following the Giants' World Series victory turned raucous and violent, with two people shot and two stabbed. Police got pelted with bottles as they tried to disperse crowds. The  Giants beat the Kansas City Royals 3-2 on Wednesday behind a stunning performance by Madison Bumgarner to win their third World Series title in five seasons. With the victory, the Giants completed a 4-3 series win over the Royals in the best-of-seven Major League Baseball championship, adding another crown to their brilliant every-other-year pattern of post-season success dating back to 2010.

'I was just thinking about getting outs until I couldn't get them anymore,' said Bumgarner. 'Fortunately I was able to get some quick innings and I was able to stay in there.

At first, the partying unfolded peacefully Wednesday night with fans gathering in the streets and uncorking champagne, dancing and hugging strangers after their team won its third championship in five years with a 3-2 victory over Kansas City in the winner-take-all seventh game. 'I knew they were going to win. It's the Giants. They do this all the time,' San Francisco native Barbra Norris, 54, said of the team's odds-defying victory in Kansas City the night after a 10-0 loss. But in some areas, the atmosphere grew rowdier as the night wore on. Fans climbed onto buses and smashed the windows on a police car. Violence left four people injured in separate incidents, but it was not yet known if the shootings and stabbings were linked to World Series revelry, police said. San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr will hold a news conference Thursday morning about the violence. Authorities said 54-year-old man and a 19-year-old woman were stabbed in separate incidents in the city's Mission district late Wednesday and early Thursday, respectively. Both were expected to live. A 19-year-old man was shot in the arm in the same neighborhood, and another person walked into a hospital with a non-life-threatening gunshot wound, police said. No arrests had been made yet.

Celebrations became more raucous as the evening drew on with police making a 'handful of arrests' Riot police walk down the streets as a shower of bottles are thrown at them by celebrating fans . Shortly after the celebrating began, Officer Gordon Shyy, police spokesman, said officers made 'a handful of arrests' as fans filled the streets and blocked traffic around the Civic Center, in the Mission District and on Market Street within walking distance of AT&T Park. Bottles were hurled at police as they attempted to disperse crowds and help firefighters put out bonfires, Shyy said. Multiple officers suffered minor injuries, but Shyy did not yet have an exact number. He also said one was treated at a hospital. The San Francisco Chronicle reported that the region around Third and King streets was especially raucous with thousands of fans spraying beer, smashing bottles, lighting fires and setting off fireworks. Police in riot gear lined up three rows deep, and revelers began tossing bottles at them, the newspaper reported. The wild street scenes lasted into the early hours Thursday. Shyy said crowds were still in the streets in some areas and stoking bonfires shortly after midnight. But by early Thursday morning, he said crowds had dispersed. Earlier in the night, across from San Francisco City Hall, where the exterior lights had been glowing Giants orange all week, more than 9,000 people gathered in an outdoor plaza. The city set up a Jumbotron for viewing the game and a vendor sold hot dogs - but no beer. 'You come out here to feel the pulse of the city. When it's the seventh game, you want to get the vibe,' said Geoff Goselin, 61. Armed police appear apprehensive as they walk through the smoke filled streets surrounded by revellers .

'Bumgarner is the beast, the man,' Aden Bacus, 41, shouted after the exhausted pitcher secured the final out with the potential tying run on third base. 'I'd be lying if I told you I wasn't nervous there at the end.'

"Luke Shaw might be a £31million Manchester United star and England defender but that did not stop him being turned away from the X Factor's live show in London on Sunday after arriving late. The 19-year-old, who was voted man of the match by the United fans for his performance in their 1-0 win over Crystal Palace on Saturday, travelled down to Wembley for the show, only to be turned away by security after turning up five minutes late.

On the field things have certainly been improving for Shaw though - he has started United's last four league games, with Louis van Gaal's side losing just once in that time.

"Barcelona gave Jeremy Mathieu and Marc-Andre ter Stegen their first starts but it was the wise old head of Xavi who rescued them against Nice. The Spaniard came on in the second half to pull the strings and converted a penalty to make the score 1-1. Xavi came extremely close to leaving Barcelona this summer, having been linked with moves to both the United States and Qatar, but eventually decided to see out the last year of his Barcelona deal - and having that experience around while the squad deals with huge changes could prove vital. Eye on the ball: Pedro controls the ball with the outside of his left foot as a Nice player tries to tackle him . Masterful: Andres Iniesta holds off Jeremy Pied during Barcelona's second pre-season friendly . Shouting instructions: Luis Enrique signals to his players during Barcelona's 1-1 friendly draw with Nice . Luis Enrique's side had flown to France on Saturday morning after a week's training at St George's Park, to face opponents who are ready for the new season. Nice kick off their Ligue 1 campaign next weekend, but the Catalans still have three weeks to go before La Liga begins. Nice: Hassen (Cardinale 62): Puel (Palun 77), Genevois, Bodmer, Amavi; Mendy, Eysseric (Rafetraniaina 59), Hult (Benrahma 77); Pied (Honorat 59), Cvitanich (Maupay 59), Bautheac (Bosetti 76). Goal: Cvitanich pen 21. Booked: Pied. Barcelona: Ter Stegen; Montoya (Patric 39), Pique (Bartra 46), Mathieu (Ie 61), Alba (Grimaldo 61); Busquets (Xavi 46), Iniesta (Rakitic 46), Sergi Roberto (Samper 46); Adama (Halilovic 46), Rafinha (Munir 46 (Sandro 76)), Pedro (Deulofeu 46). Booked: Iniesta. Goal: Xavi pen 67. They were without Lionel Messi, Neymar, Javier Mascherano and Dani Alves for this clash, all of whom return to the fold on August 5. Barcelona's second pre-season friendly, following their 1-0 win over Recreativo Huelva, featured a lot more of their stars with the Spanish players returning to action. Alex Song is still absent for family reasons, while star signing Luis Suarez is suspended. Instead, it was some of the other summer purchases who got the chance to appear at the Allianz Riviera. Mathieu had a shaky start to his Barcelona career, with a couple of misplaced passes and then a foul on the edge of his own box. The Frenchman has plenty to prove at Barcelona with a €20million fee on his shoulders, a baffling amount for someone about to turn 31. There is pressure on Ter Stegen too, who is expected to be the long-term successor to Victor Valdes. He remained calm, palming a low free-kick away and gathering a long shot with ease early on. However, there was little he could do about the opening goal, when Gerard Pique gave away a penalty. The defender is coming off the back of a poor season and a worse World Cup and shoved over Dario Cvitanich in the box. It was a soft decision to give, but the player picked himself up and rifled it past Ter Stegen. The goalkeeper dived low to his right and got a hand to Cvitanich's effort but it was not enough. Cool finish: Dario Cvitanich made no mistake with his spot-kick, sweeping a shop past Marc-Andre ter Stegen . Applause: Nice forward Cvitanich is congratulated by his team-mates after putting the French side in front . Rafinha - brother of Thiago Alcantara - is also looking to impress this season, but started up front in an unfamiliar false nine role. He made way at half-time along with several of his team-mates as a new look side entered the fray. Sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta hailed Mathieu for his immense pace when he was presented, but the defender was caught out by Valentin Eysseric and had to bring the midfielder down on the right. However it was also Mathieu who headed the resultant free-kick away - his extra height will be a boost for Barca at the back this season. Barcelona were sloppy in the first-half, creating little until the minutes before the interval. Pedro hit the bar with a mis-hit cross, while a surging run from highly-rated youngster Adama Traore was rudely ended with a trip. Pedro cut the free-kick back to Jordi Alba, whose low drive was beaten away by Mouez Hassen. Connection: Nice goalkeeper Johan Cardinale punches the ball away from Barcelona centre-back Marc Bartra . Flawless technique: Andres Iniesta controls the ball brilliantly in front of Jeremy Pied in midfield . Sergio Busqets, having taken to the field for the first time in the No 5 shirt he inherited from retired captain Carles Puyol, made way for Xavi, Ivan Rakitic made his debut, replacing Iniesta. Barcelona should have been level five minutes after the re-start, when Gerard Deulofeu pressured Nice into an error, but Munir El Haddadi fired straight at the goalkeeper when clean through. The game began to open up more in the second half, with Barcelona looking a lot more incisive thanks to veteran midfielder Xavi. He played three sublime passes shortly after coming on, helping Barcelona look significantly more threatening. It was the 34-year-old who pulled Barcelona level, after Munir was taken down in the box by Romain Genevois and the game's second penalty was awarded. Xavi sent Yoann Cardinale the wrong way from the spot, dispatching it into the left-hand side of the net. Young guns: Sergi Roberto, left, and Rafa Alcantara, right, were both given playing time by Barca boss Enrique . They could have added a second a few minutes later, but Deulofeu was selfish and ended up being tackled at the end of a fantastic run. His decision making was the one aspect of his game which was lacking at Everton and he should have squared the ball to Munir. Instead Genevois stole in to sweep the ball away. Sandro had an opportunity late on, curling the ball against the left-hand post in the 82nd minute from close range after Edgar Ie's sliced shot landed at his feet. Enrique won't be too disappointed with the result, with his players still some time away from being fully fit and also without their star names. However, he will hope that the injury which forced Martin Montoya off in the first half is not too serious, and that the side have more fluency on Wednesday night. Next up for Barcelona are Italy's Napoli, who will be a far tougher proposition than Nice.","Veteran midfielder scored late penalty to level the scores in friendly match .

"Carlos Tevez scored a stunning goal to help Juventus crush Parma 7-0 and move provisionally six points clear at the top of the Serie A table on Sunday. Tevez ran most of the length of the field and beat four men to score Juventus' fourth before doubling his tally minutes later. 'We had a great game,' said the forward, who was recently called up to the Argentina squad for the first time in nearly three-and-a-half years.

Fiorentina host Napoli and Inter Milan entertain Hellas Verona later on Sunday. Former Arsenal target Alvaro Morata netted a double to send Juve six points clear at the top of the table . Fernando Llorente was also on target twice as Parma suffered their heaviest defeat in Serie A history . Parma travelled to Turin hoping they had kickstarted their season after last week's surprise 2-0 win over Inter Milan ended a club record run of six consecutive defeats. Juventus, who were coming off the back of a 3-2 victory over Olympiacos in the Champions League, took the lead in the 24th minute when Llorente rushed in to tap home the rebound after Paul Pogba's shot was parried by Antonio Mirante. Lichsteiner doubled Juve's advantage five minutes later with a scorching 25-yard strike into the top right corner and the Switzerland defender then unselfishly crossed for Llorente to volley home his third goal in as many games. Tevez scored twice during the game before leaving to a standing ovation from the Juventus fans . Juventus defender Stephan Lichsteiner weighed in with a goal of his own in Turn .

Parma are bottom of the table again as half-time substitute Sergio Pellissier scored his first two goals of the season for Chievo, heading in the winner moments after Milan Djuric's equaliser two minutes from time. Lazio were looking for a sixth win in seven matches, while Empoli hoped to avoid a fourth successive defeat.

"Manchester United star Ryan Giggs has given a tour of his new Hotel Football - and admits he couldn't resist being the first to have a kick-about on the rooftop pitch. The Reds' assistant manager was one of the first to stay overnight at the venue on Tuesday, as staff prepare for its public opening day on March 2. Giggs and ex-teammate and now Sky Sports pundit and England coach Gary Neville launched a joint hospitality company – GG Hospitality – with ambitions of developing a worldwide football-themed hotel and restaurant empire. The hotel officially opens on March 2, but is holding 'soft launches' at the restaurant for the next couple of weeks . Ryan Giggs has gone into business with former teammate Gary Neville to open Hotel Football in the shadow of Old Trafford . And Giggs took advantage of all of the hotel facilities, including the rooftop where he famously had a kickabout with his fellow former United legends Paul Scholes, Gary and Phil Neville and Nicky Butt, when the area was still a building site. He said: 'I think Cafe Football is my favourite part of the hotel, but what is great is there are so many different elements to the offering here. 'It's great to have the five-a-side pitch on the rooftop with fantastic views of Manchester United, Salford Quays and the city in the background. 'Me and the kids had a kick-about up there last night. But what is great is you could go up there and get married, or have a kids' party, or it could be a Ministry of Sound club night.' Giggs said he and the GG Hospitality team have been delighted with how the hotel has now come together after years in the planning. Ryan Giggs tested out the food offerings in the restaurant and was impressed with his pizza and fish and chips . Former Manchester United footballer and now assistant manager Ryan Giggs is opening Hotel Football, only a stone's throw from Old Trafford . He said: 'It's been four or five years in the making so it's nice to experience it and see it finally coming to fruition. 'Obviously here it's right in the shadow of Old Trafford, but Hotel Football is something we hope to take around the UK and eventually around the world, so it's more a celebration of football in general.' Meanwhile Giggs couldn't resist tasting a whole host of Cafe Football's menu. The restaurant and cafe areas have a relaxed feel and the sport of football is certainly not thrust in your face . As well as being a tribute to the beautiful game, there are other sports or activities to amuse guests . He added: 'You can tell I've retired now. I had a little pizza to start, then fish and chips and finished it off with Vimto trifle. 'A lot of the menu is stuff from your childhood, like bubble gum ice cream.'. Talking about the new development, Gary Neville said: 'Ryan and I have spent so much of our lives playing at Old Trafford and appreciate everyone who supported us there over the years. 'To make sure that the hotel appeals to everyone, not just football fans, we are working with some of the most talented people in the industry to create something unique and inviting – with a focus on excellent customer service.' Reminiscent of the Manchester United Tunnel, Ryan Giggs' love for the Red Devils is portrayed beautifully . Guests will be able to test their football skills out on the rooftop pitch, which Ryan Giggs has already given his seal of approval . The hotel officially opens on March 2, but is holding 'soft launches' at the restaurant for the next couple of weeks, with 50 per cent off in the restaurant, and rooms available from £50 a night. The 10-storey building will also house a supporters club, and Neville has previously said it will play host to up to 1,250 fans before matches. Giggs and Neville were on site and pictured talking to the builders who are working on the project. The hotel will also hold conferencing and other events, such as the sporting memorabilia show currently on, with signed photos of ex-players . According to 'Caterer and Hotelkeeper', Hotel Football is costing £20million as the players link up with two Singaporean businessmen - Kiam Ho and Andy Yun - as the major shareholders. Friends of the footballers as well as some fellow players are also reported to be involved in the project. It is unknown how much money that Neville and Giggs are committing themselves to the company GG Hospitality. It will be the parent company of Cafe Football, with the first restaurant outlet open in the Westfield Centre in Stratford. It is expected to seat around 120 people and will be offering affordable food, with two courses available for £16-per-head.","Giggs was one of the first to spend the night at the venue as he stayed over with his family on Tuesday .

"Defending champion Rafael Nadal has pulled out of the US Open after failing to recover from a  wrist injury. Nadal was in a race to be fit for the final Grand Slam of the year, which begins on August 25, after injuring his right wrist during a training session in Majorca last month. And the Spaniard has had to admit defeat, which is good news for Andy Murray who will now be moved up one place in the seedings to No 8. Out: Defending champion Rafael Nadal will not be playing at the US Open this year because of injury . It means the Brit will face an easier draw at Flushing Meadows should he make the last 16, facing an opponent seeded between No 9 and 12. In an announcement on Monday afternoon, Nadal said: 'I am very sorry to announce I won't be able to play at this year's US Open, a tournament on which I've played three consecutive finals in my last participations. VIDEO Injury forces Nadal out of year's final grand slam . Doubling up: Nadal won the US Open for the second time last year - the first coming in 2010 . Murray's potential last-16 opponents: . No 9 seed - Jo-Wilfried Tsonga (Fra) No 10 - Kei Nishikori (Jpn) No 11 - Ernests Gulbis (Lat) No 12 - Richard Gasquet (Fra) 'I am sure you understand that it is a very tough moment for me since it is a tournament I love and where I have great memories from fans, the night matches, so many things. 'Not much more I can do right now, other than accept the situation and, as always in my case, work hard in order to be able to compete at the highest level once I am back.' As a result, Roger Federer is bumped up to the No 2 seed which is a boost to the 33-year-old's hopes of winning his first Grand Slam since Wimbledon 2012. If Federer - who won his first Masters title for two years in Cincinnati on Sunday - was to win the tournament, he would move above rival Nadal in the rankings to No 2. King of New York: Nadal beat Novak Djokovic in the final at Flushing Meadows last year . It has not been the best of years for 14-time Grand Slam champion Nadal, whose last match was a shock last-16 defeat to 19-year-old Australian Nick Kyrgios at the start of July. Nadal, 28, did win the French Open in June for a ninth time but struggled during the early part of the clay-court season and suffered a back problem during his defeat in the Australian Open final to Stanislas Wawrinka.

"A new television series has shed light on the bizarre Japanese trend for 'bagel heads'. The extraordinary look, which is created by injecting saline into the forehead, then pressing in the centre of the swollen area with a thumb, is a hit on the country's underground body modification scene. The dramatic results of the two-hour treatment last just 16-24 hours, after which the saline is absorbed by the body and the forehead reduces back to its normal size. Bagel heads: John (left), Marin (centre) and Scorpion (right) pose after having saline injected into their foreheads to create the bizarre body modfication . The process is revealed on National Geographic's Taboo, where three people are seen undergoing the treatment in Tokyo. It shows John, Marin and Scorpion having a large needle, attached to a saline drip, inserted into their foreheads. The practitioner administering the . treatment, Asami, is heard saying: 'You really need to do it the right . way, to reduce the risks.' The sensation is evidently . uncomfortable. As it punctures the skin, John says: 'Ooh... That's a . needle going into my head... Ooh.' Breakfast chic? Marin poses with her new 'bagel head'. The effects are temporary and the saline will be absorbed by her body after 16-24 hours . Once fully inserted, the outline of the . needle is clearly visible under the surface of the skin, and the saline . slowly begins filling the forehead. At this point, John describes . feeling 'a slight stinging sensation'. 'It's a relaxing sensation, kind of tingly, and also a building pressure that's kind of slow and steady that kind of . feels like it's putting me to sleep' He then reports a trickling feeling . so intense, he is convinced that the liquid is falling down the outside . of his face, asking the room: 'Is there . something dripping down my head? ... I can really feel it in there, . trickling down.' After an . hour or so, the brave trio's foreheads look significantly swollen, and . they appear to have become accustomed to the needle in his head. 'Right now it's kind of a relaxing sensation, kind of tingly, and also a . kind of building pressure that's kind of slow and steady that kind of . feels like it's putting me to sleep,' John says. Over the course of two hours, around . 400cc of saline is transfused into each forehead. Once it has reached . the desired size, the practitioner removes the needle, and presses his . thumb into the centre of the swelling. Extreme procedure: Practitioner Asami pinches Marin's forehead to insert the needle for her saline transfusion . When the thumb on his forehead is removed John looks stunned, and the room breaks into a round of applause. 'Oh sweet buttery bagels - I'm impressed!' he exclaims. 'I look delicious!' 'Oh sweet buttery bagels - I'm impressed! I look delicious!' The finished look is deemed 'cute' by . Marin, who sits beside him. Once she and Scorpion, have also had their . needles removed and thumbprint made, the trio admire their new looks . with delight. The trend was initially sparked by the artist Keroppy, according to an interview in Vice last year. He told the magazine how he came across it in Toronto, Canada, at the extreme body modification convention Modcon in 1999. 'I . happened to meet Jerome, who was the person who pioneered saline . infusions,' he explained. 'We stayed in contact, then eventually I . experienced saline with him in 2003 and he gave me permission to bring . it to Japan. Waiting game: John, Marin and Scorpion must allow two hours for their foreheads to fill with saline . 'I set up a team in Tokyo to administer infusions for other people. That’s been going since 2007.' He said fans of the procedure enjoy 'saline parties' about twice a year, though some people will take their 'bagel head' to clubs and fetish parties. The saline injections can be done on any part of the body - some people have even had 'scrotal infusions', he revealed - but for the most part, it is just the forehead. On its (thankfully) short-term effects, Keroppy joked: 'We enjoy being freaks for the night!' Taboo airs Sundays at 10pm ET/PT on the National Geographic Channel and will premiere in the UK in January 2013.","National Geographic's Taboo shows three people having saline infusions to create the look, inspired by the breakfast favourite ."
"Paul Scholes has questioned Manchester United's transfer policy this summer following their opening day Premier League defeat at home to Swansea. United have made two signings in Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw but Scholes insists the club should have done better in recruiting more talent to Old Trafford. Speaking as pundit on BT Sport, the Red Devils legend insisted Louis van Gaal's side lack of midfield quality was to blame for their 2-1 defeat to the Swans. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Van Gaal: Our confidence will be smashed down with result . Shrewd business: Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has questioned their transfer policy this summer . Maestro: Club legend Scholes (second right) enjoyed a trophy-laden spell in the heart of United's midfield . Down and out: Scholes has insisted United boss Louis van Gaal to spend money on their midfield area . Cesc Fabregas, Toni Kroos and Arturo Vidal were all top class targets but United have watched the Spaniard join Chelsea for £30million, the German move to Champions League winners Real Madrid for £24m while the Chilean is still at Juventus. Herrera started Saturday's encounter but Scholes is worried United may not attract the quality of players in the middle of the park who can supply captain Wayne Rooney and co up front before the transfer window closes on September 1. Talent: Ander Herrera (left) made his Manchester United debut in their Premier League defeat to Swansea . 'We need more players,' Scholes said. 'They miss the likes of [Patrice] Evra, [Nemanja] Vidic, Rio [Ferdinand] and you saw they were inexperienced and got caught. 'But the big thing for me was the quality just wasn’t there in the midfield. '[Wayne] Rooney and [Juan] Mata couldn't feed off anything. They looked better in the first 20 minutes of the second half and when United got the goal you expected them to kick on and get the crowd going but you didnt see it coming. 'The big thing about Louis van Gaal spending big money now is – who comes in? Is the quality there? The two big players haven’t come – Toni Kross and Cesc Fabregas.' On the ball: Toni Kroos left Bayern Munich to join Champions League winners Real Madrid . Blue is the colour: Cesc Fabregas (centre) swapped Barcelona for Chelsea in a £30million deal . Scholes also questioned Van Gaal's decision to employ a 3-5-2 formation at Old Trafford, where United's teams have traditionally played more orthodox 4-4-2 formations. He said: 'When you look at United the last 20 years its been 4-4-2 or 4-4-1-1 and that where we had all our success. 3-5-2 may be some LVG is a little obsessed with because it worked in the World Cup for him – there’s no doubt about that. 'But this crowd need a little bit of excitement and for me 3-5-2 is not a boring way of playing but it is a very slow way of playing, all about possession rather than having that thrust and ability to score goals.'","Paul Scholes questions Manchester United transfer policy .

"House Speaker John Boehner blasted Attorney General Eric Holder on Thursday for suggesting that Republicans only attack him because he's black. 'There is no issue of race here,' he told a reporter during his weekly press briefing on Capitol Hill. Holder went off-script Wednesday during a . speech to Al Sharpton's National Action Network, slammed Republicans . for consistently attacking him and Barack Obama because they are the . first African-Americans to hold their jobs. 'What attorney general has ever had to . deal with that kind of treatment?' he said, alluding to his status as the only African-American ever to hold that post. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . WASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 10:  U.S. Speaker of the House John Boehner insisted that AG Eric Holder's race-based complaints were without merit, but his office left out that part of his remarks on its website . Angry: Attorney General Eric Holder spoke in front of a backdrop decorated with the slogan 'No Justice, No Peace,' complaining that Republicans have treated him with disrespect because he's black . Sharpton's . group is a 23-year-old organization comprised of black civil rights . activists, making Holder's comments appear to be a statement about his . race, and President Obama's. Decorations on the stage backdrop where he spoke included the slogan 'No Justice, No Peace.' The backdrop to the growing feud is GOP . legislators being at their wits' end waiting for the Justice Department to . turn over tens of thousands of pages that are under subpoena, some for . as long as three years. The . House of Representatives held Holder in contempt of Congress in June . 2012 because of his failure to comply with subpoenas for documents. Boehner responded to Holder's comments: 'There is no issue of race here,' Boehner said. 'The frustration is that the American people have not been . told the truth about what happened at the IRS. The American people have . not been told the truth about what happened in Fast and Furious. The . administration has not told the American people about Benghazi.' 'We . have been going through all of these hearings, having to hold people in . contempt because they have made it impossible to get to the documents. They have not been forthcoming; they owe the American people the truth.' 'When . it comes to Benghazi we’ve got four Americans who are dead,' the Ohio . politician concluded. 'Their families deserve the truth about what . happened and the administration refuses to tell them the truth.' A day before, Texas Republican Rep. Blake Farenthold said in a Capitol Hill hearing that he shouldn't be asking Holder any questions because he should be 'in jail' for contempt of Congress . Holder famously claimed in 2009, and again in 2014, that America has historically been 'a nation of cowards' on racial issues. On Wednesday he appeared to lay that burden at Republicans' feet. 'The . last five years have been defined by significant strides and by lasting . reforms even in the face, even in the face of unprecedented, . unwarranted, ugly and divisive adversity,' Holder said. 'If . you don’t believe that, you look at the way – forget about me, forget . about me – you look at the way the attorney general of the United States . was treated yesterday by a House committee. It . 'has nothing to do with me, forget that,' he said. 'What attorney . general has ever had to deal with that kind of treatment? What president . has ever had to deal with that kind of treatment?' The Justice Department's website includes a copy of his prepared remarks, showing that a flustered Holder improvised his complaint about Tuesday's House Judiciary Committee hearing. 'The last five years have been defined by significant strides and lasting reforms – even in the face of unprecedented adversity,' he was supposed to say. 'Last summer, after a narrowly split but divided Supreme Court struck down a key part of the historic Voting Rights Act of 1965, my colleagues and I took action.' During Tuesday's hearing, two Republicans slammed Holder about his failure to comply with document subpoenas related to the Operation Fast and Furious gun-walking scandal. Fast . and Furious involved a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and . Explosives program that sent more than 2,000 guns across the U.S.-Mexico . border in the hope of tracking them to drug cartels. Barely one-third . of the firearms were recovered, with some of the lost weapons later . being linked to more than 200 deaths – including the murder of a U.S. Border Patrol agent. Al Sharpton (R) has made his career about addressing racism -- often aided by substantial payments from companies his organization targets -- providing Holder with a perfect forum to complain that the GOP targeted him because he's black . Lashing out: When Texas Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert brought up Congress' criminal contempt citation against Holder onTuesday, the attorney general snapped, 'You don't want to go there, buddy!' Following years of stonewalling over subpoenaed documents related to the scandal, the House took a vote and found Holder in criminal and civil contempt of Congress. Rep. Blake Fahrenthold, a Texas Republican, refused to ask Holder any questions during the hearing Tuesday, saying that Holder would be 'in jail' if he were an ordinary American who ignored a subpoena from the DOJ. And when Rep. Louis Gohmert, another Texas GOP member, brought up the contempt resolution and suggested that Holder hadn't taken it seriously, the attorney general snapped. 'You don't want to go there, buddy!' he carped. Holder was expected in some corners to cancel his speech following revelations earlier in the week that Sharpton, now an MSNBC host, became a mob informant in the 1980s following a police sting operation in which he was caught trying to buy large amounts of illegal drugs from an undercover officer.","House Speaker John Boehner insisted that attacks on Attorney General Eric Holder have nothing to do with the color of his skin .

I felt awful, because I was psyched up about playing and I really wanted to play.

"If the NFL is really serious about getting London to embrace the American game, it may want to consider sending over the Cowboys Cheerleaders whether Dallas is playing at Wembley or not. As American as apple pie, bourbon, Marilyn Monroe and Elvis, the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders have been an institution for decades and they are just as recognisable, if not more so, than their NFL team’s distinctive star logo. After getting in early on Tuesday morning, the ladies have been busy promoting Sunday’s game at Wembley against the Jacksonville Jaguars, participating in community events, exploring London, and of course, finding time to practice. With only a short amount of time to get a lot of things done, the team has been attempting to operate with the speed and efficiency of a two-minute drill in the fourth quarter. The Cowboys cheerleaders wrap up warm and jump for joy outside Wembley's world famous arch . ‘We keep saying “You’re only in London once,” so that’s our new phrase for YOLO this week,’ two-year DCC member Jennifer Kathryne said. ‘We just keep telling ourselves we want to take in as much as we can. We’ve foregone a few extra-precious hours of sleep to go see Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey and do some shopping. We’ve definitely done our best to get out there and see the city.’ ‘My favourite part about sightseeing was Parliament and going into the House of Commons,’ Angela Rena, a sports massage therapist who hails from Australia, said. ‘We witnessed a debate going on about England and Iran. That was an experience we wouldn’t have otherwise been able to have.’ The differences in language have also been somewhat of a change from the US. ‘I think our favourite word is rubbish,’ Emma Mary, a four-year DCC member who enjoys National Public Radio and iBooks, said. ‘We can’t stop talking about the rubbish. We haven’t been here long enough to start saying “loo,” but if we were here a few more days I could totally see some of us picking up on that.’ The cheerleaders visited Marylebone Station during their sightseeing tour of the capital . The difference between chips, French fries, crisps and potato chips is still a bit confusing. ‘We went to a fish and chips place around the corner and then they had actual potato chips on the table for us,’ Nicole Bulcher, who holds degrees in history, justice studies and sociology, said. ‘When we told the woman the chips were good, she told us they were crisps. Okay… crisps, chips, French fries, fried potatoes, they’re all good.’ Although they’ve enjoyed eating fish and chips, lamb, toffee pudding and other English dishes, the ladies are calling for ‘some queso’ in London as they’ve been missing one particular taste from home: . ‘Mexican food. I was born, bred and raised on Mexican food and I’ve been craving it,’ Miss Kathryne said. ‘It’s only been a few days, but I’m ready for some spicy, southern, Tex-Mex food.’ The comfort food of Dallas may be across the pond, but the members of the cheerleading squad anticipate feeling right at home on Wembley even though the Cowboys will technically be the away team on Sunday. ‘The Cowboys are an international brand,’ Miss Rena said. ‘We saw people wearing Dallas jerseys near Buckingham Palace and I think even though we are the away team, our fans will be loud. We’ll just own it like it’s our home stadium.’ The Cowboys cheerleaders run through their routine at Arlington . Kathryne added: ‘We could see Broncos jerseys. We could see Redskins jerseys. It will kind of be a melting pot. It’s going to make the atmosphere very exciting because people will be rooting for big plays and whatever else is exciting during the game. The crowd is going to be lively and I’m hoping to see the same intensity that they bring to a soccer match. If they bring that, it’s going to be a loud, energetic and awesome experience.’ Although the Cowboys won’t be returning to Wembley next season, the ladies are hopeful they’ll be back for a future International Series game or if the NFL installs a team in London permanently. ‘I think that would be amazing,’ Miss Bulcher said. ‘Making the NFL a more international interest would make sense. This would be the best away game to go to.’ One thing many people don’t realise when they see the boots, pom-poms and blue and white outfits is how much work cheering for the Dallas Cowboys requires, the DCC members said. Although the ladies all have other jobs, their responsibilities for the team are full-time and there is no offseason. ‘Practises and games are only 50 per cent of the job,’ Miss Kathryne said. ‘We have a lot of appearances, a lot of shows, a lot of radio spots and a lot of TV productions. Every day of the week at least one of us is doing something. It’s a full-time commitment. You’re in uniform a lot more during the week than just at the games.’ ‘Who you are really matters,’ Miss Mary added. ‘We truly are America’s sweethearts. We’re representing the Dallas Cowboys wherever we go whether it’s at our job, at our church or in London. We don’t have an offseason. Maybe two weeks in January – unless we get booked. We’re constantly performing, but we love it that way.’ The Cowbys face the Jaguars at Wembley and can count on some familiar support across the pond . Much like in the NFL, tryouts for the team are held each year and it’s not uncommon to see veterans get cut and replaced. The competition is stressful, but it also ensures that the squad is always showcasing the best possible talent on gamedays. That talent will be on full display at Wembley on Sunday and Jacie Veronica, a Louisiana native who skipped fifth grade and aspires to write for Sports Illustrated, has a message for anyone and everyone who’ll be attending the international event: . ‘We’re not just America’s team.’ Executives with dreams of establishing a permanent NFL club at Wembley should hope Londoners feel the same way. The presence of America’s sweethearts in the UK will certainly help the cause.","Five team members - Emma, Angela, Nicole, Jennifer and Jacie - speak to Sportsmail .

"The Manchester derby could have a little extra spice for Argentina team-mates Sergio Aguero and Marcos Rojo. The two World Cup finalists were said to have exchanged angry words during this summer’s tournament after Rojo - who completed his £16million move to Manchester United from Sporting Lisbon on Wednesday - invited his pal, Argentinian pop star El Polaco, into the dressing room after a group game. Unfortunately, El Polaco is the former partner of City star Aguero’s girlfriend - another Argentinian pop star, Karina Tejeda. VIDEO Scroll down for Rojo likes to have a hit from range as this compilation shows . Fallout: Argentina Sergio Aguero and Marcos Rojo fell out after an angry exchange during the World Cup .

The singers, who are stars of cumbia, a popular Latin style, have a four-year-old daughter but split acrimoniously last year. According to newspaper La Gaceta, Aguero was unimpressed with Rojo inviting the singer into the dressing room. Aguero and Rojo seemed to have managed their differences through the rest of the World Cup, with both appearing in the semi-final and final together once Aguero had recovered from injury. But there may be a degree of extra interest in the handshake between them when the Manchester teams meet on November 2. As part of the deal which sees Rojo move to Old Trafford, Nani has returned to Sporting, although United will pay the 27-year-old’s £4.8million wages for the duration of his season-long loan.

Thumbs up: She was previously in a relationship with El Polaco, another Argentine pop star, and a friend of Rojo . Sealed and signed: Rojo arrives in Manchester for his medical after signing from Sporting Lisbon . Meanwhile, United have rejected reports that they were interested in signing Germany’s attacking midfielders Thomas Muller and Marco Reus this summer. Marouane Fellaini appears destined to remain at United after he suffered suspected ankle ligament damage in training. The £27.5million midfielder was ph otographed outside a Manchester hospital on Tuesday, where he was seen hobbling on crutches and wearing a protective boot, although Sportsmail understands the Belgian has not broken his ankle. Manager Louis van Gaal signalled his intention to sell Fellaini at the beginning of the summer but United’s attempts to move him on may be doomed following this latest setback. However, the injury may not be as bad as first feared after Fellaini posted a picture of himself on Twitter last night, taking part in the ‘ice bucket challenge’ without the boot on. Napoli are interested in the 26-year-old but are looking at a loan, rather than the permanent deal that United had hoped for. Out: Midfielder Marouane Fellaini is set for a spell on the sidelines after injuring his ankle in training . With Michael Carrick ruled out until the beginning of October, Van Gaal has only Ander Herrera, Darren Fletcher and Tom Cleverley to choose from in central midfield, so he is keen to find a high-quality recruit before the transfer window closes. United continue to deny they have any interest in Arturo Vidal of Juventus, but Ajax’s Daley Blind - who can operate at left back or in holding midfield - remains a target and Roma’s Kevin Strootman could be on the agenda in January. Fellaini is still to score a competitive goal and made only 16 starts amid poor form and injury problems in his first campaign at the club. He joins a host of United players on the injury list - Carrick, Jonny Evans, Danny Welbeck, Tom Cleverley, Luke Shaw and Antonio Valencia all missed the opening day defeat by Swansea. Robin van Persie, however, is edging closer to a return and could be involved at Sunderland on Sunday.

Yet still in his short time on the pitch after being brought on for Rickie Lambert in the 79th minute, he still managed to be at the centre of a blow-up with Swansea's Jonjo Shelvey. Both formidable figures on the pitch, the Italian and the Englishman squared up, pointed, poked and had what appeared to be harsh words with each other on the pitch, and met again at the end of game. It was an encounter that required team-mates and officials to step in, with Jordan Henderson appearing to escort his team-mate from the pitch to help avoid any further dramas.

While not appearing to be a major incident, with Shelvey extending what seemed to be an olive branch with a handshake at the end, Balotelli continues to be a problem child for Reds boss Brendan Rodgers. He offended fans and team-mates when he capped off a poor performance in the Champions League against Real Madrid by swapping shirts with Pepe in the tunnel as the pair left the pitch at half-time. Balotelli was subbed at the break by Rodgers, but was not impressed when told by the media of the shirt swap after the match. Balotelli then attracted more unwanted attention amid claims he used 'threatening behaviour' against a woman trying to take pictures of his Ferrari.

"Liverpool are revving up their attempts to keep Raheem Sterling from Real Madrid's clutches by offering the wonderkid a bumper new contract. The Anfield club are set to offer the 19-year-old a new contract that will include a sharp increase on his current £30,000-per-week deal as a reward for his excellent displays this year. His current deal still has three years left to run, but Liverpool want to lock the talented youngster down to a longer contact. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Raheem Sterling freestyle with Wayne Rooney . New deal: Sterling will be offered a new contract, despite having three years left to run on his current one . Sterling has established himself as one of Europe's best emerging talents, and was one of only a few England players to enhance his reputation during the World Cup. His performances have not escaped Real Madrid, who are known to be keeping a close eye on the youngster. But Liverpool are anxious to avoid any uncertainty over their whizzkid's future and will look to ward off the Champions League holders' interest. Luis Suarez' departure means even more focus will be thrust upon Sterling's young shoulders during the forthcoming season. Transfer: Rodgers hopes to fend off Real Madrid by offering Sterling significantly more money . But there is a growing feeling at the Anfield club that Sterling is showing the maturity needed to take the added responsibility in his stride. Speaking this week, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said: 'This kid is only going to get better. He’s way above the level from when he first came in. 'Tactically, technically, and what has been beautiful to watch with Raheem has been his maturity. 'He’s turning into a beautiful young man, with all the responsibility.

"Two games, two managers, two defeats, two goals conceded to Kenwyne Jones. The Championship has not been terribly kind to Huddersfield Town in the first steps of this season. It’s been a strange old week for the Terriers, who seem to have lost a little of their yap, not to mention Mark Robins. Mark Lillis, the club’s caretaker for a third time in three years, probably put it best when he said ‘losing a manager after one game is a new one for me’. Match winner: Kenwyne Jones scored twice for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side against Huddersfield . Cardiff (4-4-2): Marshall; Brayford, Hudson, Connolly, Fabio; Bergstaller (Gunnarsson 55), Adeyemi, Whittingham, Daehli (Eikrem 81); Jones (Guerra 68), Le Fondre . Subs not used: Moore, Kim, Maynard, Morrison . Huddersfield (4-1-3-2): Smithies; Smith, Wallace, Lynch, Dixon; Coady; Hogg (Hammill 61), Majewski (Ward 61), Butterfield; Stead (Bunn 76), Wells . Subs not used: Murphy, Scannell, Crooks, Sinnott . Booked: Hogg, Wallace, Lynch . MOM: Kenwyne Jones . Referee: Keith Hill . Attendance: 20,749 . The circumstances of Robins’ departure are still not terribly clear, except that it followed a 4-0 opening-day defeat against Bournemouth, during which he was loudly jeered by his own fans and felt the players had ‘gone’. The club initially said it was in the ‘interests of all parties’; the chairman, Dean Hoyle, later revealed Robins had, in fact, walked. The shame for Lillis is that his squad seemed to be walking as well for the first 45 minutes of this fixture. By the time they found their stride they were already two down against a club that would view another Championship season as a failure. They got better and, more impressively, continued to fight for Lillis after going 3-1 down. But praise is not the same as points, and endeavour is not necessarily a match for a striker like Jones, who is not yet fully fit and has already scored three goals this season. His scruffy first came on 35 minutes, six after Peter Whittingham’s 30-yard strike put Cardiff in front. Murray Wallace pulled one back in first-half stoppage time before Jones wrapped it up with a powerful drive 10 minutes after the restart. ‘Kenwyne has worked hard this summer,’ said Cardiff manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who subbed off the Trinidadian after 68 minutes. ‘He is still not fit enough to play 90 minutes - we are working on him.’ It seems to be working. Jones was a disappointment after joining last January, scoring only once as they went down. He remains infuriatingly inconsistent, missing the ball completely when a great chance came his way in the first half. But his power and finishing have been proven over time in the Premier League and, on current evidence, he will thrive at the lower level. Celebration: Jones jumps in the air after scoring Cardiff's third goal at the Cardiff City Stadium . ‘He came to us in January having played not much football,’ Solskjaer said. ‘He played a couple of games on adrenaline and the fitness caught up with him. It is an important season for him.’ The same can be said of Solskjaer. For Huddersfield, the ambitions are lower but no less intense. ‘It’s our third season in the Championship and we want to stay there,’ said Lillis. Things will have to improve under their third manager of the season.","Huddersfield are bottom of the Championship after two big defeats .

"If selling his World Cup medal gets Jimmy Greaves £50,000, good luck to him . Brendan Rodgers' Real Madrid gamble spectacularly backfired . Football is a results business. The end justifies the means. Seeing that Brendan Rodgers switched his team around, lost to Real Madrid and was then beaten at home by Chelsea, his gamble was not a success. Liverpool are now in the bottom half of the table, a point better off than West Bromwich Albion. That is worrying, too, no matter the mitigation of injuries. Nobody at Liverpool expected to be one-season wonders in Europe having returned to the Champions League in such style. The controversy in Madrid could prove damaging to Rodgers’ personal ambitions, too. The big European clubs do not forget.

Rodgers (right) on the bench at the Bernabeu where his decision to omit Steven Gerrard and Co backfired . Rodgers' gamble in European's premier competition didn't go as planned and he paid for it . In 1985-86 Juventus were drawn to play Barcelona in the quarter-finals of the European Cup. Despite not having their influential playmaker, Bernd Schuster, Barcelona progressed 2-1 on aggregate. They won 1-0 at home, scored the away goal in Turin and then defended it, Italian-style. Juventus were a good team that year. Michel Platini was still in his prime and they won Serie A losing just three games. And as a result of those matches, on odd occasions, Terry Venables would receive a call from Turin asking if he might be interested in the Juventus job. The timing was never right and the move didn’t happen, but on the back of two resilient performances — Barcelona were underdogs, but the better team over two legs — the Agnelli family kept his name on file. By contrast, how will Rodgers be recalled in Spain? As the man who sent the second team out at the Bernabeu. They will not look beyond the team sheet or regard his decision as brave or pragmatic.

"Ian Holloway launched an assault on elements of his own supporters last night after a large number of Millwall fans mocked the travelling Leeds contingent over the Jimmy Savile scandal. Holloway was left appalled by crass and disgusting chants relating to the sex crimes committed by the late entertainer in Leeds and, unprompted, demanded an end to vile chanting at matches. He said: ‘I didn’t like the banter to be honest. I don’t think it was respectful, I really don’t. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Millwall boss Ian Holloway wants his team to enjoy playing . Disrespect: Holloway criticised the Millwall supporters who mocked Leeds fans about Jimmy Savile . ‘I don’t think [Savile chants] are right. I don’t care where he is from — that [Savile’s actions] is an absolute disgrace. Let’s stop and think about what he has actually done. That’s the most important thing and we don’t see that. “Oh, it is a bit of banter”. It isn’t funny, is it? I don’t think so. ‘Nobody likes a laugh more than me but I’m respectful — and that’s what I’m trying to show to Leeds United. ‘Until we make a stand the world ain’t right. How often do we turn a blind eye to things? I want to look after our people. Some of the stewards aren’t as big as me. Why can’t people in the stand say, “Chuck this guy out?” Coming into a ground doesn’t give you the right to say those things.’ Millwall have worked hard in recent years to tidy their unruly image, with Holloway highlighting the fact that they were rated as having the most improved family experience last season. Banter? The Millwall manager is known for his quirky sense of humour but said that the chants were not funny . He added: ‘I am bursting with pride about my club, but I will ask my fans if they think that is right. It is disrespectful.’ The fans’ behaviour took the shine of an impressive Millwall win that exposed the weaknesses of Leeds’s playing staff at a time when their off-field antics are drawing scrutiny. For Dave Hockaday, this defeat — inflicted by goals from Mark Beevers and Shaun Williams — was bad. The only consolation was that the second half was not as bad as the first and, perhaps, the man known as the manager eater will have no appetite for head coaches. Hockaday was quick to make the distinction in terminology as he attempted to explain a performance that will not have escaped Massimo Cellino’s attention. How could it when the Italian goes where the team goes. He was in the dugout before the game, and briefly on the touchline ahead of kick-off to talk to the groundsman. Showing the way: Holloway is trying to make Millwall a better place for fans to go to watch football . He was also in the dressing room and exchanged a handshake with his head coach. But there were no words, even if there was, presumably, a lot to say after a showing as weak as this. Hockaday said: ‘I will talk to the owner tomorrow. I saw him before the game, I shook his hand afterwards. He was talking to the Millwall groundsman about I don’t know what — he wants to learn about English football.’ He won’t have liked much of what he learned here. Beevers was left unmarked for the opener, Noel Hunt blew a great chance to equalise early in the second half and Williams secured the points for Millwall with a late penalty. ‘First half we didn’t perform, didn’t stick to the game plan,’ Hockaday said. ‘Second half we got their attention and made a fist of it. We responded well. But football is about moments.’ At this moment, Leeds have a lot to work on.","Holloway calls out Millwall fans chanting about paedophile .

"Dylan Adams, 26, the brother of murder suspect Zachary Adams was arrested on Wednesday after Tennessee Bureau of Investigation agents accused him of tampering with evidence tied to the Holly Bobo investigation . The brother of a man accused of kidnapping and killing a 20-year-old nursing student has been charged with tampering with evidence in the case. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said in a news release Thursday that on April 13, 2011, the day Holly Bobo disappeared in West Tennessee, 26-year-old John Dylan Adams of Decatur County disposed of items he knew could be evidence in the case. Adams is the brother of Zachary Adams. He was charged with murder in March and his family has property about 6 miles from where Bobo's remains were found by ginseng hunters this month. Another man, Jason Autry, faces the same charges as Zachary Adams. Both men have pleaded not guilty. The TBI said John Dylan Adams was in jail without bond. The brother of murder suspect Zachary Adams was arrested on Wednesday after Tennessee Bureau of Investigation agents accused him of tampering with evidence tied to the Holly Bobo investigation. TBI agents believe that on April 13, 2011, John Dylan Adams disposed of items he knew to be of evidentiary value to the case, according to the release. 'Our investigation is by no means complete with this arrest and with this charge,' Jodh DeVine said. 'We're continuing to follow leads, continuing to work evidence and continuing to do everything we can to bring justice for the family and friends of Holly Bobo.' District Attorney Matt Stowe said that the latest arrest is part of the ongoing effort to bring to justice everyone involved in Bobo's disappearance. 'Everything right now is part of our comprehensive plan to find everyone responsible in this case,' Stowe said. On April 2, Zach Adams was charged with coercion of a witness. The warrant in that incident states Zach Adams asked an unnamed inmate to 'Tell my brother he is the one who started this (expletive), and if he don't shut his mouth he will be in the hole beside her.' Adams is tentatively scheduled to appear in court in Decatur County at 9 a.m. on Monday.

In the wake of Miss Bobo's . disappearance her brother told police that he saw a man dressed in . camouflage leading her away into the woods. She had been preparing to go to class at nursing school on the morning of her disappearance. The . director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) said the Bobo . investigation has been the most expensive and exhaustive in TBI history, . and it's not over yet. Since . she disappeared, the small town of Parsons and surrounding areas in . West Tennessee tried to support the family, putting up pink ribbons on . lamp posts, mailboxes and storefronts. Miss Bobo was wearing a pink . shirt and carrying a pink purse before she disappeared. Two . men found a skull earlier this month Sunday not far from property owned by the family of . Zachary Adams, who has been charged with Bobo's kidnapping and murder. He has pleaded not guilty. The area near his family's property was searched in March. Another man facing murder and kidnapping charges, Jason Autry, also has pleaded not guilty. Recently . elected District Attorney Matt Stowe said his office was preparing to . seek a possible death penalty in the case. A decision is expected in . coming weeks, after he consults with the Bobo family, he said. 'The . evidence is voluminous,' Stowe said.

May, brothers Jeffrey Pearcy and Mark Pearcy were both charged . with accessory after the fact and tampering with evidence. Like Autry and Adams, they have pleaded not guilty. Jeffrey Pearcy, left, and Mark Pearcy, right, have both been charged with accessory after the fact and tampering with evidence . TBI . director Mark Gwyn previously said the agency has sworn statements from . witnesses who claim to have seen Bobo alive with Autry and Adams after . she had been reported missing. Gwynn added that they also had physical evidence being analyzed at two crime laboratories, and several witnesses.

"Yahoo's second-in-command Henrique de Castro has been fired by CEO Marissa Mayer after just 15 months on the job - but his severance package should help sweeten the surprise dismissal.

Mayer cut her top lieutenant in a . possible sign that the Internet company's efforts to revive its . long-slumping advertising sales aren't paying off. Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer has fired COO Henrique De Castro (right) after just 15 months at the Internet giant . De Castro's massive payout was estimated by Equilar Inc, a compensation researcher, Bloomberg reported. Wednesday's . surprise announcement of the departure of Yahoo's chief operating . officer, represents a setback for Mayer, who signed him to a $58 million contract just 15 months ago. Henrique de Castro, 48, who is originally from Portugal, received his first business degree from the University of Lisbon. He went on to study for an MBA in Switzerland before becoming a consultant at McKinsey. He later worked with ex-boss Marissa Mayer at Google. De Castro sits on the boards of several major companies including Target which he joined in 2013. According to a 2012 Business Insider profile of de Castro, the executive was not well-liked by people under him. Former Google colleagues described him as a 'difficult personality'. Another told BI: 'Henrique wants to be The Most Interesting Man In The World from those Dos Equis commercials.' De Castro's hire was planned by Mayer . to help her lure more advertisers to a company that has been struggling . to compete against Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. in the race for online . marketing dollars. Yahoo Inc. declined to comment on the reasons for de Castro's abrupt exit. Mayer didn't name his replacement. In a terse memo, leaked to Recode, Mayer wrote: 'I made the difficult decision that our COO, Henrique de Castro, should leave the company. I appreciate Henrique’s contributions and wish him the best in his future endeavors.' She added: 'Overall, I’m confident that the leadership team, our direction, and these changes will enable even more successful execution.' It's doubtful de Castro would be leaving if he were bringing in the revenue that Mayer envisioned, said BGC Financial analyst Colin Gillis. 'This was one of her key hires and he is already gone,' Gillis said. 'It doesn't look good.' Mayer, who knew de Castro from the days when both executives worked at Google, will likely be questioned about what went wrong when she reviews Yahoo's financial results for the fourth quarter, scheduled to come out January 28. The Sunnyvale, California, company hasn't warned that it missed its revenue forecast for the three-month period ending in December, an indication that Yahoo must have at least been reasonably close to hitting that financial target set by Mayer. Henrique de Castro is a business executive originally from Portugal who moved from Europe for the COO title at Yahoo . Yahoo headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. The company suddenly finds the seat of COO at the company empty after the swift departure of Mr de Castro . Yahoo had projected fourth-quarter revenue of about $1.2 billion after paying commissions to its ad partners, unchanged from the previous year. De Castro will leave Yahoo with much of the money and stock that he got when Mayer lured him to California from a Google advertising job in Europe. Things aren't all bad for Henrique de Castro following his surprise exit from Yahoo. He made an estimated $109 million from his brief 15 months at the company, including salary, bonus, stocks, compensation for leaving Google and severance pay, according to Equilar Inc., a compensation researcher, quoted by Bloomberg. De Castro is entitled to $20 million restricted stock bonus. This is on top of the $39.2 million package in cash and stock that he received in 2012. De Castro also will receive $1.2 million to cover the next two years of his salary. De Castro's termination by CEO Marissa Mayer is effective from today. His severance package includes $20 million of restricted stock that wasn't scheduled to fully vest until late 2016. He also will receive $1.2 million to cover the next two years of his salary. His rights to another batch of restricted stock valued at $9 million also have vested. Although de Castro's hiring turned out to be an expensive mistake, Mayer is unlikely to face a harsh backlash from Yahoo stockholders who have made a lot of money since she defected from Google in July 2012. Yahoo's stock has nearly tripled in value since Mayer's arrival, even though the company's revenue hasn't increased under her leadership. The company's shares dipped 7 cents to close at $41.07, then slipped another 29 cents in Wednesday's extended trading. Yahoo stock opened lower again at $40.39 on Thursday. Mayer has been benefiting from a $1 billion investment in Chinese Internet company Alibaba Holding Group that was engineered in 2005 by Terry Semel and Jerry Yang, two former Yahoo CEOs who stepped down as the company's stock plunged. Yahoo reaped a $7.6 billion windfall by selling a portion of its Alibaba holdings shortly after Mayer took over and still retains a 24 percent stake in the Chinese company. Many investors have been buying Yahoo stock as a way to get a piece of privately held Alibaba, whose revenue and earnings are growing rapidly as it prepares to go public.","Chief operating officer Henrique de Castro was one of Meyer's key hires .

"Wayne Routledge and Angel Rangel stuck the boot into Alexis Sanchez after Swansea came back to defeat Arsenal on Sunday. Sanchez showed his confidence on Twitter at 10.35pm on Saturday, posting a smiling image of himself with team-mates including Wojciech Szczesny and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, saying: 'Tomorrow those 3 points are coming to London #GUNNERS.' Despite the Chilean scoring the opener, the three points stayed in Swansea and Routledge and Rangel were quick to remind him of the fact. Alexis Sanchez's tweet on the eve of their clash with Swansea was proven to be a poor prediction . Swansea winger Wayne Routledge reminded Sanchez of the tweet after his side's 2-1 win on Sunday . Angel Rangel produced his own reply to Sanchez (top tweet) after referring to the Chilean's earlier comment . Routledge couldn't help himself after the match, with the winger retweeting the comment and image with the simple jibe: 'Ermmmmmm...' His team-mate Rangel also referred to the tweet following the win by putting it in quotation marks and three question marks after it. He also tweeted: 'Seems like 3 points stay in Swansea. Great team performance again #SWANS'. Their ridicule will have been more directed at the Arsenal team as a whole than Sanchez himself, who once again delivered for the Gunners with his sixth goal in four Premier League games. Sanchez celebrates after his tidy finish to a slick move from Danny Welbeck put Arsenal in front . Their lead, taken just after the hour mark, lasted just 12 minutes when Gylfi Sigurdsson delivered a outstanding free-kick. Bafetimbi Gomis then headed home the dramatic winner a matter of seconds after coming from the bench to replace Wilfried Bony. The loss for Arsenal comes just five days after they blew a three-goal lead in the Champions League to Belgium's Anderlecht and now leaves them lagging 12 points behind leaders Chelsea.

"MailOnline has now confirmed that Alec Baldwin has been nixed from the MSNBC lineup following the scandal surrounding his homophobic insults and run-ins with multiple photographers. Hours after the news broke, Baldwin took time out of filming a movie in Hawaii to tell his side of the story- and place at least a portion of the blame on gay rights advocates who he argues used him as a scapegoat. The scandal erupted earlier this month when he was videotaped using a homophobic slur towards a photographer outside of his apartment. Though recordings of the events make it appear that he called the man a 'c********** f**,' Baldwin has maintained that he said 'c********** fathead'. He has since apologized for saying the first half of the slur, claiming he did not know that it was derogative towards homosexuals. 'If I called him 'cocksucking maggot' or a 'c********** motherf*****'... 'f*****' is not the word that came out of my mouth. That I know,' Baldwin told local blog Gothamist by phone on Tuesday evening. 'But you've got the fundamentalist wing of gay advocacy—Rich Ferraro and Andrew Sullivan—they're out there, they've got you. Rich Ferraro, this is probably one of his greatest triumphs. Off the air: Alec Baldwin's show on MSNBC was cancelled following a series of public clashes with photographers . 'They killed my show. And I have to take some responsibility for that myself.' Baldwin's decision to point to . Ferraro, a spokesman for GLAAD, in the interview comes as a bit of a . surprise since he previously announced via Twitter that Ferraro was the . one who called Baldwin after the incident to explain that 'c**********' was a slur. He removed . the Tweet shortly after posting it, but MailOnline screen-grabbed it and . it reads: '1-Rich Ferraro from @glaad informs me that c'sucker is an . anti-gay epithet. In which case I apologize and will retire it from my . vocabulary.' '2- you learn something new every day.' Both . of the men that Baldwin mentioned by name condemned Baldwin publicly, . with Ferraro issuing the statement from GLAAD and blogger Andrew . Sullivan writing a lengthy article on his well-read political blog . calling for his show to be taken off the air. Naming names: Baldwin specifically cited GLAAD's Rich Ferraro (left) and blogger Andrew Sullivan (right) as two members of the 'fundamentalist wing of gay advocacy' who had him fired . Called out: GLAAD publicly chastised Baldwin shortly after the incident for his homophobic language - the second time the group has intervened with him this year . Pleading ignorance: Baldwin offered up an apology in the days after the altercation and this excuse after GLAAD criticized his use of language- which he Tweeted but deleted shortly after . Baldwin went on to compare himself to . MSNBC's other controversial host, Martin Bashir, who is also facing . calls for his resignation after suggesting on-air that something . horrific should be done to former Alaskan governor Sarah Palin. MSNBC . has not made any statements about the fate of Bashir's show but the host . apologized to Palin and she accepted it. Bringing him into it: Baldwin cited the fact that MSNBC has not fired Martin Bashir for making highly inappropriate comments about Sarah Palin . 'Martin Bashir's on the air, and he made his comment on the air! I dispute half the comment I made...' Baldwin told Gothamist. 'There's . nothing you can do when you get thrown in this washing machine, . nothing. You know? Nothing. All you end up doing is just defending . yourself all day long.' The . actor's late night talk show 'Up Late With Alec Baldwin' was . originally suspended for two weeks immediately following his argument . with photographers and journalists outside of his New York City . apartment. In a pseudo 'mea . culpa' that the actor wrote following his earlier two episode . suspension that preceded the announcement of his show's cancellation, . Baldwin hinted that it may be taken off the air permanently. An employee at MSNBC has confirmed to MailOnline on Tuesday that the star's nascent show has been officially cancelled. The New York Post first spoke with the Golden . Globe-winning actor's spokesman who reportedly took issue with the word . 'fired' but did confirm that the show will no longer be on the air. Cryptic: Alec Baldwin retweeted this Nelson Mandela quote just three hours before the news broke . Supportive: Baldwin's wife Hilaria put up this inspirational message Tuesday evening . 'The show is not coming back. He had questions on whether he wanted to continue,' the spokesman said. Not long after their article was published, Baldwin's spokesman Matthew Hiltzik and MSNBC issued a joint statement to The Huffington Post. 'We are jointly confirming that UP LATE will not continue on MSNBC,' the network said in the statement. 'This is a mutual parting and we wish Alec all the best.' 'The decision has been made. He’s gone,' a different unidentified insider told The Post. 'The (parent company) Comcast guys have decided. Word is spreading through the building.' Hours before speaking to Gothamist- which is where he last went to explain himself after getting into an online Twitter rage against a MailOnline journalist- the actor retweeted an inspirational quote from . Nelson Mandela just hours before the news about the MSNBC decision broke . on Tuesday afternoon. 'There were many dark moments when my faith in humanity was sorely tested, but I would not and could not give myself up to dispair,' the post read. Confrontation: The reporters were outside his apartment earlier this month following his appearance in court when he testified against his stalker . Apparently his use of a slur was not . the only reason why Comcast decided to cut the program. Even before the show was suspended following the run-in with the photographer, it was already struggling. The ratings for the show's fifth week were down 40 per cent from the premiere audience and dropped to 395,000 total viewers. The reportedly had difficulty booking guests, as Terms Of Endearment actress Debra Winger and fellow MSNBC host Chris Matthews were the two biggest names who appeared on the short-lived program. The inside sources also claimed that Baldwin was overly demanding behind the scenes and said that he required a personal humidifier and his own make up room because a woman who he would have been sharing it with has cancer and a sensitivity to hairspray. 'I don’t give a f*** if she has cancer or not, I want that f****** makeup room,' he allegedly screamed. When the temporary suspension was announced on November 15, Baldwin hinted that it may not return. 'Whether the show comes back at all is at issue right now,' he wrote in an essay published on The Huffington Post. 'If quitting the television business, . the movie business, the theater, any component of entertainment, is . necessary in order to bring safety and peace to my family, then that is . an easy choice.' Though he may have been down at that point after having three separate arguments with reporters and photographers in the span of one day, it didn't stop him from taking pot-shots at the competition in the blog post. Off the air: Baldwin's show was first suspended for two weeks and then cut from the lineup entirely . 'If the show dies, its fate ends up being no different than the vast majority of start-up TV programming, and so be it. We do take a small amount of pride in knowing that we beat CNN in the ratings each of our nights. (I forget who they had on at that time.)' 'I have been a fan of MSNBC for some time. Its left-leaning tone never bothered me. I still believe that they are more enamored of and devoted to the truth in any single hour than Fox is all year long.' In a note that seems like he knew trouble was brewing, he did say that a cancellation of his program may help fellow MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, who he called the 'single most important television journalist on the air today'. 'If my show does disappear, I will be grateful in so far as her good work, along with that of (Lawrence) O'Donnell and (Chris) Hayes and (Al) Sharpton and (Chris) Matthews and (Chris) Jansing, will not be sullied by my problem,' he wrote. The series of incidents this month were just the latest in a string of violent and homophobic altercations that Baldwin has been a part of over the years.","MailOnline can now confirm that MSNBC has cut Alec Baldwin's late night talk show .

"A member of the cabin crew on board the missing Malaysia Airlines plane reportedly had a flight simulator at his home. The revelation comes after police confiscated a flight simulator from the home of Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah. Authorities will be analysing the virtual flight paths used on the simulators as suspicions that the plane was hijacked harden. A message posted to an online flight simulator community by Captain Zaharie (above, with his home simulator) asked for 'buddies' to contact him about his 'awesome' simulator to take it 'to the next level. Motion!' Artists express hope: Students gather around a three dimensional artwork, based on the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, that was painted on a school ground in Makati city. According to the artists, the artwork is their way of expressing sympathy towards the relatives of passengers onboard the missing Boeing 777-200ER . Thoughts and prayers: Children write a message at the Wall of Hope for the passengers of the missing Malaysian Airlines plane at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia . Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said at a news conference Monday that finding the plane was still the main focus, and he did not rule out finding it intact. 'The fact that there was no distress signal, no ransom notes, no parties claiming responsibility, there is always hope,' Hishammuddin said. Captain Shah, a father-of-three, was passionate about his simulator, which he built using off-the-shelf parts. Zaharie had joined an online flight simulator community called X-Sim and after making his simulator, in November 2012 he posted a message about its 'awesome view' inviting 'buddies' to get in touch so they could take the simulator 'to the next level of simulation. Motion!' 'Elo guys, zaharie here,' says the post. 'Awesome view on 3 panasonic 32 in. LCD HDMI and and 3 touchscreen Dell 21 inches for main (MCP) , center pedestal, overhead panel. 'Time to take to the next level of simulation.Motion! looking for buddies to share this passion. 'Capt Zaharie Ahmad Shah, BOEING 777 MALAYSIA AIRLINES.' Police dismantled the flight simulator and then reassembled the parts at police headquarters. Then experts began to probe the simulator’s programme to find out if there was anything there to show that he had been ‘practising’ how to make his aircraft ‘invisible’.

Mystery: The aircraft that's vanished photographed at the Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport in 2001 . The final picture: The missing jet is pictured here in February this year above Polish airspace . On Monday it emerged that a flight engineer who was a passenger on MH370 is being investigated as officials probe anyone on board who had aviation skills. The aviation engineer is Mohd Khairul Amri Selamat, 29, a Malaysian who has said on social media he had worked for a private jet charter company. Malaysian investigators are trawling through the backgrounds of the pilots, crew and ground staff who worked on the missing Boeing 777-200ER for clues as to why someone on board flew it hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of miles off course. ‘Yes, we are looking into Mohd Khairul as well as the other passengers and crew. The focus is on anyone else who might have had aviation skills on that plane,’ a senior police official with knowledge of the investigations told Reuters. As he's investigated, his wife, Emy, waits in hope. No trace of the plane has been found more than a week after it vanished but investigators believe it was diverted by someone with deep knowledge of the plane and of commercial navigation. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said on Saturday evidence pointed to a deliberate diversion of the flight, given the controlled way it was apparently turned around and flown far to the west of its original route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Probe: Police in Malaysia have searched the home of pilot Zaharie Ahmad . Shah (left) and Fariq Abdul Hamid (right) after officials confirmed the . plane was taken over by a 'deliberate act' A flight engineer is responsible for overseeing systems on a plane during flights to confirm they are working correctly and to make repairs if necessary. As an engineer specializing in executive jets, Khairul would not necessarily have all the knowledge needed to divert and fly a large jetliner. Khairul had said he worked for a Swiss-based jet charter firm called Execujet Aviation Group, but the company declined to say whether it still employed him. In a picture posted on Khairul's Facebook account in 2011, he identified himself as an employee of Execujet's Malaysian operations. ‘We can't disclose anything. We want to protect the family's privacy,’ an official at the company's Malaysian office said. Khairul, a father of one daughter, had recently bought a house on the outskirts of the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, and had more than 10 years’ experience as a flight engineer, his father Selamat Omar told Reuters.

How MH370 would have looked: Flight MH318 to Beijing sits on the tarmac as passengers are reflected on the glass at the boarding gate at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in the early hours of Monday . He declined to say whether he believed his son could have been involved in any foul play. Selamat said he and other family members were supposed to visit Khairul's new house this month. But Khairul had told his father on Thursday he had to go for a job in Beijing and that they would reschedule. That was the last time they spoke. ‘Khairul was doing well in his job and was a good son. He would come visit us at least once a month,’ Selamat said. The final words - 'all right, good night' - from the missing Malaysia Airlines flight were spoken after its communication equipment was disabled, it has been revealed, as footage emerged showing the aircraft's pilots walking through security for the final time before take-off. These words from the cockpit of the missing plane were spoken - by co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid - as it was leaving Malaysian-run airspace and being handed over to air traffic controllers in Vietnam. The sign-off came after one of the plane's data communication systems, which would have enabled it to be tracked beyond radar coverage, had been switched off, Mr Hussein said on Sunday. The informal hand-off went against standard radio procedures, which would have called for him to read back instructions for contacting the next control centre and include the aircraft's call sign, said Hugh Dibley, a former British Airways pilot and a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society. Investigators are likely to examine the recording for any signs of psychological stress.","Police confiscate flight simulator from home of MH370 captain .

"Frank Maloney, who guided boxer Lennox Lewis to become the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, is now living as a woman called Kellie and is preparing to have a sex change. The promoter and manager, who has suffered heart problems in recent years, retired from boxing in October, claiming she had fallen out of love with the sport - but it has now emerged she walked away to begin preparing for her new life as a woman. Maloney, who was born in London, was involved in the sport for 30 years and had hoped to lead Liverpool heavyweight David Price to the top of the division. VIDEO Scroll down to watch 'Maloney talks about his heart attack in 2009, before sex change' New world: Kellie Maloney, formerly boxing promoter Frank, will undergo gender reassignment after feeling trapped in the wrong body .

Speaking at the time, the famously flamboyant Millwall-supporting promoter said: 'For the last year I have gradually fallen out of love with boxing and my passion has been missing,' he said in a statement. 'I did much soul searching over the summer and my heart is no longer in the sport that I loved so much. 'If I continued as his promoter it would be unfair as I cannot give the commitment and love for the sport that is needed to get his career back on track. 'I no longer got the buzz I used to get.

Maloney was both a promoter and manager and the boxers he has worked with include... Lennox Lewis . David Price . Rendall Munroe . John McDermott . David Haye . Julius Francis . Jon Lewis Dickinson . However, she has now revealed she has felt trapped in the wrong body ever since she was a child. Speaking to the Sunday Mirror, she said: 'I can’t keep living in the shadows, that is why I am doing what I am today. Living with the burden any longer would have killed me.' The 61-year-old admits the pressure and confusion caused by her struggles with her identity caused battles with drink, depression and drugs and has been secretly receiving counselling and therapy. Kellie says she kept her turmoil in the shadows because she feared a backlash from the notoriously macho world of boxing. 'I have never been able to tell anyone in boxing,' she added. 'Can you imagine me walking into a boxing hall dressed as a woman and putting an event on?' Kellie is now over a year into the transition period before surgery and in the past two years she has secretly undergone hormone therapy, hair removal and voice coaching. One of the hardest parts of the decision was telling her second wife and Kellie insists she doesn't want a new relationship and isn't interested in a sexual relationship with anybody.

"It does not get any more emphatic than this. England, so desolate after Lord’s, were utterly irresistible. India, with such an opportunity to make history in this series after going one up, were pathetic. The transformation is complete. What a turnaround for Alastair Cook and England since they went one down in the second Test with a last-day collapse that saw knives being increasingly sharpened for the captain and all those involved in their rebuilding programme. What an embarrassment for MS Dhoni and India as they contemplate their total surrender at The Kia Oval to follow equally abject displays at Southampton and Old Trafford.

They simply capitulated here and their captain should consider his position but, India being India, they will probably just shrug their shoulders and move on to one-day cricket. That’s what has made their players millionaires. There can rarely have been a more one-sided day than this, more so even than the third in Manchester which saw India lose nine wickets in a session despite Stuart Broad being injured, Jimmy Anderson being ill and a hurricane on the way that would have washed out the last two days. From the first ball on Sunday England were supreme, pretty much as they have been ever since Cook started turning things around with both bat and his captaincy at the Ageas Bowl. They have won just about every session since. How purposeful was batting that, led by Joe Root and featuring a courageous cameo from Broad, smashed another 101 runs in just 11.3 overs on the third day to take England’s lead up to a commanding 338. India would not have got past that if they had been given three more innings, let alone another one. As it was . they lasted a mere 29.2 overs, barely a session, with only a shower . enabling them to hold out until 4.22pm and the humiliation of being . bowled out for 94. It was India who were the biggest shower. In their . last five innings they mustered 178, 152, 161, 148 and now double . figures, worse even than England’s harrowing performances in Australia. How . to explain it? Yes, India have been terrible but it would be wrong to . take anything away from England. There had been near misses and promise . all season, as there will be with any virtually new side, but from . Southampton onwards the senior spine delivered the goods and that made . all the difference. Magnificent: Joe Root celebrates his century on his way to making 149 in England's innings of 486 .

Now they are looking like a team again, one with the perfect mix of exciting emerging players and experienced ones at the top of their game. Certainly Anderson and Broad now seem as potent as any new-ball pairing in England’s history while Ian Bell has finally become a leader rather than follower. Then there is the captain. Few England skippers can have suffered as much opprobrium as Cook when the bitter post-Ashes aftermath threatened to engulf him. He was close to packing it all in after the fourth day against Sri Lanka at Headingley when he had a nightmare in the field but, after vowing not to be a quitter, he has shown immense character in fighting back.

This 3-1 victory and Cook’s return to something near his best form cements him as England’s captain for next year’s Ashes, barring a complete collapse in fortunes, and he has visibly grown as a leader over the last three Tests. He will certainly have relished the final rites of this Investec series. What a batsman Root has grown into this year, his unbeaten 149 taking his series average to 103 while the speed of his runs ran India ragged. And what character, too, from Broad, who came out to bat with his nose broken in two places little more than a week ago and proceeded to flay the inevitable short-pitched bowling that came his way to all parts of The Oval. He struck 37 from 21 balls and in a flash England had got up to 486 all out. Could India at least show some fight, a little application to restore a semblance of pride for the millions of fans in their cricket-mad country? Not a bit of it. They batted like a village side to collapse to their third crunching defeat, their second by an innings and their third heaviest hammering of all time. Don't look back in anger: Ravichandran Ashwin glances as Gary Ballance parries the ball for Ian Bell (left) to catch him for seven runs . Running away with it: Chris Jordan celebrates after the catch is taken to remove Ashwin . Another one bites the dust: Broad celebrates after removing Ajinkya Rahane for four runs . Timing: Root watches the ball intently before hitting Ishant Sharma to the boundary for four . Floored: Ishant Sharma ends up on the ground as Joe Root attends to the wicket next to him . Anderson needed six victims to overtake Sir Ian Botham and become England’s leading Test wicket-taker but could manage just two thanks to the collective effort of the attack. He will not mind that and must now wait until his 100th Test in Antigua next April for his crowning moment. Broad, who had such a poor game at Lord’s, was a menacing accomplice to Anderson while here, unlike at Old Trafford, the supporting cast of Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes were almost as dangerous, Jordan sent India hurtling to their demise with four wickets for 17 in just 19 balls. Thrashed is an under-statement. England will confirm on Monday that Cook will carry on as one-day captain for the start of the build-up to February’s World Cup, and why not? After rising to the biggest challenge of his career he has earned the right to do that. Bigger than the World Cup, of course, are the Ashes and it will not be long before Australia come calling again. Bring on the Aussies? Well, England have some way to go before we can say that but there is promise that they can regain the urn now when as recently as last month there was little more than despair.

"Trevor Whitehead, pictured, may have fallen from a tree to is death while trying to spot wildlife, an inquest heard . An award-winning nature photographer found dead in a stream at a remote beauty spot may have accidentally fallen from a tree to his death while trying to spot wildlife, an inquest heard. Building society cashier Trevor Whitehead, 51, had walked to a secluded spot of woodland on the lookout for birds and other creatures. One theory is that he was overcome by a dizzy spell as he clambered onto a branch 30ft above the ground before falling to his death, a coroner was told. It is thought he may have been lying dead for weeks before his  body was discovered by a father and his two children who were climbing up to a waterfall. At an inquest, a coroner was unable to rule on a cause of death but inquiries revealed Mr Whitehead's rucksack was found hanging from the tree branch above his body in a renowned wildlife haven in Belthorn, Lancashire. The hearing was told Mr Whitehead, from Accrington, Lancashire, who lived alone, worked at the Skipton Building Society and was 'mad' on wildlife and would go out walking every weekend and often before work. He would travel to Scotland to watch the seals and once won a Canon Camera competition for the Prince's Trust for a photograph of a butterfly as well as numerous other prizes. The hearing in Blackburn was told Mr Whitehead trekked to what was described as a 'good vantage point for bird and nature watching' where ramblers or walkers rarely used a track. He was reported missing by his mother on April 11 after he failed to show up for work - but no trace of him was found despite public appeals and searches by mountain rescue teams. He was found at around noon on May 31 by Christopher Shaw and his two children who spotted his body in shallow water within the ravine which had steep sided overgrown gullies. In Mr Whitehead's rucksack, there was found to be medication from 2011 thought to have been for leg pain, a receipt for energy bars purchased on April 5, a wallet and an empty bread wrapper. But despite further investigations it was not possible to say for certain if he had fallen from the branch which was said not to have been 'suitable for body weight'. Trevor Whitehead's body was found at a remote spot near Belthorn, Lancashire - a renowned wildlife haven. The 51-year-old is pictured left and right in CCTV footage before he went missing . Trevor Whitehead, 51, had trekked to a secluded spot of woodland near Belthorn, Lancashire on the lookout for birds and other creatures (stock picture of countryside near the village) No injuries or fractures were found and any third party involvement was ruled out. Mr Whitehead's mother Alice said: 'He didn't always take his camera but often if he found any tracks he would go back and get his camera.' But she said she used to 'tell him off' for not having a mobile phone despite his many walks over the moors. She added that he had complained of feeling dizzy three weeks before he went missing on April 5. Mrs Whitehead added that she knew her son had gone to the spot before with friends and added: 'I honestly think he might have gone dizzy and fallen.' PC Gillian Maltram of Lancashire Police said that his body was found clothed in 'very poor terrain' and in an area that was not a common route for ramblers. The statement said that the branch where his rucksack was found was 'a great point for bird watching with a good view onto the meadow on the opposite side of the stream', but was 'incapable' of holding body weight towards the end. Trevor Whitehead was reported missing by his mother on April 11 after he failed to show for work but no trace of him was found despite public appeals and searches by mountain rescue teams . Pathologist Dr Richard Prescott told the inquest  he did not believe there to have been any signs of foul play, nor could he see any skull fractures in keeping with a fall. He said the death was 'unascertained'. Coroner Michael Singleton, concluding an open verdict, said: 'I know he was somebody that very much enjoyed watching wildlife and nature. 'We heard that going up towards the waterfall was quite spectacular. His rucksack was found on a branch on a tree that gives rise to the possibility that he fell from that tree. 'It is equally possibly having put his rucksack safe he may have been walking along the stream intending to make towards the waterfall. It's possible he fell, that he slipped, that he collapsed. 'The post mortem does not give any clues, there's no evidence he intended to cause himself any harm. 'In fact evidence is that he was looking forward. It is not for me to guess as to what may be the cause. I cannot reach a conclusion as to how Trevor Whitehead came to die in these circumstances.'","Trevor Whitehead was found dead at beauty spot near Belthorn, Lancashire .

"The mother of a three-year-old girl who drowned in a hotel swimming pool has been arrested on suspicion of murder, MailOnline understands. The little girl - named locally as Jane Bell - was on holiday at the seafront Dalmeny Hotel, in St Annes, Lancashire. She was there with her family, who are believed to be from Galashiels, Selkirkshire. The alarm was raised before midday when the girl’s body was spotted at the bottom of the indoor pool in the hotel spa area. Her mother Sarah is understood to have been arrested for murder. Scroll down for video . Brave: Hotel leisure club member Carole Greenwood attempted to save the three-year-old girl from drowning at the Dalmeny Hotel . Death: The little girl was on holiday at the seafront Dalmeny Hotel (pictured), in St Annes, Lancashire . Staff members, as well as a grandmother who was at the hotel for a swim, jumped into the water and hauled the girl to the poolside where they tried to resuscitate her. She was taken by ambulance to Blackpool Victoria Hospital and then transferred to Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital, where she later died. Last night a 40-year-old woman from Galashiels, believed to be the child's mother, was arrested on suspicion of murder by Lancashire Police. Detective Inspector Nick Connaughton said that investigations were still at an early stage. He added: ‘This is a terribly tragic situation where a young girl has lost her fight for life after an incident in a hotel swimming pool. ‘We are now treating this sad case as murder and need to know just how the child has come into difficulties in the pool.’ Police launched the probe after paramedics failed in their efforts to revive the child at the poolside as shocked guests looked on. Death: The alarm was raised before midday when the girl's body was spotted at the bottom of the indoor pool in the hotel spa area (file picture) The pool is situated on the ground floor and has its own bar. The hotel is family owned and no one from the establishment wished to comment last night. Health and safety officials will also carry out an investigation into the incident. 'This is a terribly tragic situation where a young girl has lost her fight for life after an incident in a hotel swimming pool' Detective Inspector Nick Connaughton, Lancashire Police . Last night, police confirmed that they believe the child who died had been left in the pool, which has no separate children’s section, by an adult. One witness said: ‘If this is not death by neglect I don’t know what is. Kiddies should not be left in a pool like this - there are so many risk factors.’ Witness Carole Greenwood, who has been lifeguarding and doing first aid for the past 36 years, told how she tried to rescue the little girl. She said: 'I was in the changing rooms and a lady came in and said ""There's an incident in the pool, is there a life guard?"" 'The child was on the bottom of the pool, so I dived in and got her out. I wasn't really aware of what had happened when I got there, my concern was with the little girl and rescuing her and resuscitating her as best I could. 'She was on the bottom, she was unresponsive and I pulled her out as per my training and then I resuscitated her on the side. 'I did manage to resuscitate her and she was breathing when the ambulance arrived. Obviously I'm devastated for the poor little girl, it's very sad. 'At the time you are quite shocked because all your training is coming into action something you think you will never ever do but I'm satisfied I helped out in this case.' She added that no lifeguards had been on duty in the pool, because it is not the policy in a private pool. She said: 'Basically children in swimming pools should be looked after by their own parents. 'It's not necessary to have lifeguards necessarily because life guards are there to prevent accidents and parents have got to be aware that children can't swim, they are not strong swimmers and they need to wear floatation aids especially little children and older children need to be monitored as well.' Simon Barr, on holiday with his wife, Linzi, 42, and children, Sammy, aged three and Jacob, seven months, said: 'I think it’s totally tragic for somebody to come on holiday, we have a three-year-old child as well, to come away on holiday and all of a sudden this to happen.' He added: 'We heard a girl had been taken away by ambulance then from that moment lots of police arrived. It was only later on we heard on the news the girl had died. The hotel didn’t want to divulge anything. 'The pool was closed, it was a crime scene yesterday but re-opened today. The atmosphere is pretty subdued really. The only conversation going on is what’s happened.' Another guest said: 'It’s shocking, especially when it’s a child’s death, it’s just so sad. I don’t know what happened but it was caught on CCTV one member of staff said.' A guest, who did not want to give his name, said he saw the arrested woman being taken away by police, 'in shock'. He said the night before she had been with two young girls enjoying dinner at the hotel with the other guests. He added: 'They just seemed like a normal family on holiday. I was in the room yesterday and I saw the ambulance outside and saw them come out with what looked like a defibrillator. 'Because my wife is six months pregnant I thought...then my wife came up to the room and said a little girl has been pulled from the pool. My daughter saw the little girl being carried out to the ambulance. 'I saw the woman arrested going with the police. She wasn’t cuffed. She looked just in shock. The pool was closed.

"Jesse Lingard has made sure new manager Louis van Gaal knows all about him by impressing on Manchester United's pre-season tour to America. The Dutch boss is putting the finishing touches to his plans for the season but what will he have at his disposal if he decides to keep the 21-year-old Lingard? He's looked good this summer... Yes, Lingard has appeared in several of the pre-season tour games, demonstrating his versatility by impressing in both the attacking midfield position and the right-wing back role. Usually, Warrington-born Lingard plays from the wide positions or as a second forward. He is a very capable finisher.

United front: The Red Devils pile on Lingard after his goal against their fierce Premier League rivals . So has he got a chance of being involved this season? Now 21, Lingard will soon be facing a decision - if Louis van Gaal doesn't make it for him - as to whether he should bide his time at Old Trafford or move on to guarantee regular football. Where have I seen him before? He enjoyed successful loan spells at Birmingham and Brighton last season in the Championship but he was also the star man on United's tour of Asia and Australia last summer, finishing as the top-scorer. Mixing with the big boys: Lingard and Francesco Totti do battle in United's pre-season win over Roma . Why wasn't he handed a chance by David Moyes? The tricky fixture list - United faced Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester City in the opening weeks - saw Moyes revert to more experienced names in his bid to get off to a promising start. After that plan backfired, Moyes found himself in a scenario where every match became hugely pressurised and the Scot refused to hand Lingard an opportunity. He was in line for a start in the Capital One Cup but United were drawn against Liverpool and Moyes was anxious to get a result by that stage. Where would he fit in under Van Gaal? With wingers out of fashion in Van Gaal’s new 3-5-2 system, Lingard could be in trouble at United but he may feel he can operate in the hole behind two forwards or as a frontman himself, although his side is well-stocked in those positions. His best chance may be as a right wing-back, where he played against Real Madrid, offering competition to Rafael and Antonio Valencia. The Dutchman will outline his plans to the United squad at the end of this week in a host of meetings in Manchester. Where could he go?

"An Oregon baker has refused to make a wedding cake for a lesbian couple, allegedly calling them 'abominations unto the Lord.' Aaron Klein, owner of Sweet Cakes in Gresham, is the subject of a state investigation after one of the brides-to-be filed a complaint.

Klein denied calling the women 'abominations' but admitted to rejecting their custom.

'I honestly did not mean to hurt anybody, didn't mean to make anybody upset, (it's) just something I believe in very strongly.'

"From Sally Al-Sabahi who, after being married at the age of 10, was raped and beaten by her much older husband to 13-year-old Ilham who, in 2010, died from internal bleeding four days after being forcibly married, the plight of Yemen's child brides makes for harrowing reading. But following international condemnation and campaigns by charities such as UNICEF and Equality Now, the country's government finally appears ready to end the shocking tradition once and for all. Fouad Al Ghaffari, the director general of Yemen's Ministry of Human Rights, has revealed that the country's minister for Legal Affairs, Mohammed Al Mikhlafi, is to submit a bill that would outlaw child marriages if passed. Protest: A former child bride attends a demonstration against the practice in the Yemeni capital Sana'a . And in a sign that attitudes might finally be changing in the Middle Eastern country, it was reported last week that police officers stepped in to prevent the marriage of a nine-year-old girl in the southern city of Taiz - the first time such an intervention has taken place. According to reports on the BBC website, police halted the wedding and convinced the father of the girl, named locally as Hiba, not to allow the nuptials to go ahead. Although there is nothing currently to prevent Hiba's wedding from happening at a later date, campaigners are cautiously welcoming of the intervention and the news that legislation could be imminent. 'In 2009, the Yemeni parliament considered a draft bill that fixed the minimum age of marriage for girls at age 17 and included penalties and punishment for those in violation,' said Equality Now's Middle East and North Africa consultant, Suad Abu-Dayyeh. 'Unfortunately this was not successful, but we are heartened that the Yemeni Human Rights Minister Hooria Mashhour has requested the reintroduction of this bill, which would effectively ban child marriages in the country.' Rescued: Nojud Ali, 8, (left) and nine year-old Arwa were granted divorces after being forcibly married in 2008 . She added: 'Along with our local partners, the Yemen Women's Union, we wholeheartedly support the minister and the Human Rights Ministry in their efforts to ensure that the government of Yemen lives up to its obligations under international law by passing a law prohibiting child marriage so that girls are no longer forced to undergo the harmful physical and psychological effects of child marriage. 'It is also promising that the government appears to be be taking steps to deal with this issue head-on and protect girls from this devastating abuse.' Cases recorded since 2008 include that of 11-year-old Wafa who was married in 2010 to a 40-year-old farmer who repeatedly raped and tortured her and 13-year-old Hind, who in 2009, was married to a 70-year-old man. While many cases end in tragedy, Wafa was one of the lucky ones after Equality Now and local partner Yemeni Women Union (YWU) successfully helped her obtain a divorce.'My message to other parents is that they should not think of marrying their daughters at a young age, girls should go to school,' said Wafa. 'I don’t want any girl to suffer as I did. Girls should be educated in order to be able to live happily and in dignity.'","The Yemeni minister for Legal Affairs is to put forward a bill to ban it .
Since 2008, cases of brides as young as nine have come to light .
Campaigners have offered a cautious welcome to the reports .

"It was a year where the fast food chains outdid themselves with their rather peculiar creations. Burgers stained with charcoal bamboo and cheese made from squid ink, a pizza with a crown-crust of chicken fillets and an ice-cream sundae studded with bacon excited and appalled in equal measure. From KFC's chicken burger stuffed with beef and Pizza Hut's cranberry sauce crust to KFC's popcorn chicken nachos and McDonald's Crab Croquette, here are 14 of the world's most astonishing junk food creations. Scroll down for video . Japan's Crab Croquette consisted of a snowcrab and mushroom croquette with ketchup in a ciabatta bun . Burger King Japan's beef burger with blueberries (right) and mushroom waffle-patty hybrid burger (left) BARMY BURGERS . While there's nothing wrong with the concept of a crab burger, the McDonald's crab croquette has us feeling a little but unsettled. Available only Japan, the snowcrab and mushroom croquette was swaddled between a ciabatta bun and covered in ketchup. It was said to taste pleasantly fishy, similar in texture to the restaurant's filet-o-fish burger. In Canada Burger King transformed the country's unofficial national dish of poutine - chips served with gravy and cheese curds - with their own rather messy twist adding a chopped up Whopper, mustard, ketchup and pickles to the already stodgy mix. KFC's all-meat monstrosity was a slab of beef stuffed between crumbed chicken and topped with  bacon . Whopper poutine anyone? Burger King's take on Canadian comfort food is a gravy-covered mess . Sausage or a pizza? Luxembourg's Pizza Hut had a sausage roll crust pizza, which came with a cheesy dip . Burger King's  restaurants in South Korea offered customers a beef patty topped with blueberries (in fruit and sauce form) and a mushroom waffle-patty hybrid burger served with a side of raw mushrooms. KFC's now infamous Double Down, a heart attack waiting to happen, saw the usual burger bun replaced with pieces of chicken. South Korea took the concept even further with the addition of a slab of beef smack bang in the middle of the burger, turning it into the Double Down King. The quadruple-meat concoction offered hungry customers two pieces of crumbed chicken, bacon, and a beef patty coated in a two types of sauce for  less than £5. Pizza Hut used 'soft cheese technology' to connect the Doritos to the outer edge of the pizza . Pizza Hut worldwide went meat mash-up mad like chicken fillet and cheeseburger crusts in the Middle East . KFC had a dalliance with dairy, serving Brazilian customers chicken sandwiches topped with Philadelphia cheese and creamed corn while diners in the Philippines were served a chicken drumstick marinated in cheese, with a side of saffron rice. Domino's Pizza in India ventured into the sandwich business with their Subwich, a three-bean patty with bell peppers and spicy relish served between two pizza crusts. The vegetarian offering was part of the chain's foray into conquering the lunch break market in India. Burger King Japan's black bun burgers Kuro Pearl and Kuro Diamond both featured black cheese made with bamboo charcoal, a black-pepper burger, onions, garlic sauce made with squid ink and an eye-catching black bun. Bon appetit! Squid ink stained the cheese slices in Burger King's Kuro Pearl and Kuro Diamond burgers . KFC's nachos box with tortilla chips, popcorn chicken, salsa and cheese made its entrance in Australia . It's not the first time the chain served black burgers. Back in 2012 it introduced the Premium Kuro Burger and in 2013 the Kuro Ninja went on sale, which was identical to the Kuro, with the addition of a slice of bacon. McDonald’s in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong also sold black bun burgers this year containing a beef patty topped with onion and black pepper sauce. HYBRID PIZZA CRUSTS . A topic worthy of its own feature, Pizza Hut's menu revamp this year signalled the start of some rather interesting crusts. There was the double whammy of the Crown Crust Chicken Filet Pizza and  the Crown Crust Cheeseburger Pizza which debuted in the Middle East. South Koreans were treated to shrimp, calamari, sausage, bacon, steak, cranberry and cream cheese in theirs . KFC Brazil's creamed corn and Philadelphia topping on a chicken sandwich . An unholy alliance of meat and cream, Burger King's bacon sundae is said to be salty, crunchy and sweet . Then South Koreans were introduced to surf-turf and dessert pizza which had shrimp, calamari, sausage, bacon and steak cranberry (or apple) and cream cheese crust - a savoury pizza with distinctly dessert-like flavours. But the pièce de résistance of crusts made its entrance in Australia in November. The Doritos crust may have been the cleverest fast food invention we had seen... or the worst. Fans of Pizza Hut Australia were wailing in consternation at the creation, taking to social media networks to express disbelief at the monstrous marriage of nacho chip and pizza. Using 'soft cheese technology' Doritos are connected to the outer edges of the pizza so, the chain says, diners can 'intuitively enjoy two of their favourite things simultaneously'' In Luxembourg, Pizza Hut stuffed their crusts with sausage rolls, served with a cheesy dip. It was a starter and main course in one meal that did particularly well in the country. While not strictly a pizza, KFC's nachos box sits quite well in this category. The product, which sounds like it was created just for Americans, was actually made for Australian outlets. Domino's Subwich, a three-bean patty with bell peppers and spicy relish served between two pizza crusts . McDonald's China's Black & White pie has a coconut filling encased in a deep-fried chocolate covered shell . Almost as soon as it appeared on menus, there were complaints from customers claiming that their box of nachos covered in popcorn chicken and smothered with salsa and cheese looked nothing like the advertisement. DANGEROUS DESSERT . Some would call this unholy. An alliance of meat and cream formed to titillate the tastebuds of its American diners, Burger King's bacon sundae is said to be salty, crunchy and sweet - and has had the thumbs up from food bloggers in the States. Smoky shards of bacon rest atop soft serve vanilla ice cream, and caramel and chocolate sauce is drizzled on top of the concoction. A further well-grilled hefty rasher is placed on the side of the cup, to be used as a spoon to scoop the ice-cream. In China McDonald's revealed their new Black & White pie. Similar to a Bounty bar, the deep-fried dessert has a coconut filling and a chocolate flavoured pie-shell and was available in the chain's restaurants from August to September this year.","Burger King debuted black cheese slices stained with squid ink .

"Rural communities who oppose wind farms because of the way they look are ‘irrational’, Vince Cable said yesterday. Turbines are no different to the electricity pylons that already dominate the skyline, said the Business Secretary. He risked angering countryside homeowners when he pointed the finger at anti-wind farm campaign groups in beauty spots such as Yorkshire. He also claimed the Tories – who have proposed caps on onshore wind farms from 2020 if they win the election – have a ‘phobia’ about the green energy source. ‘We have a problem and it’s a political problem,’ he told a fringe event yesterday. Business Secretary Vince Cable, pictured at the Lib Dem conference today, said most families would rather have a garden outside their front door than protected greenbelt miles away from their home . ‘For reasons I don’t fully understand, our Coalition partners have a pathological aversion to onshore wind. It is making this hard. Lying behind it there is some really irrational phobia.’ At the Lib Dem conference yesterday, Energy Secretary Ed Davey attacked the Conservatives for wanting to restrict turbines. He claimed communities secretary Eric Pickles, who is reviewing a number of controversial wind farm planning applications, was ‘abusing his ministerial power’. Mr Davey said the onshore wind energy sector has been ‘growing fast’ and now generates around 5 per cent of Britain’s electricity. ‘Yet Mr Pickles doesn’t seem worried about climate or energy bills,’ he said. ‘Mr Pickles is in danger of bringing the planning system into disrepute.’ Tory communities minister Kris Hopkins last night insisted that the Coalition introduced transparent changes to planning guidance and appeal rules in assessing wind farm applications. Mr Cable said families in places like Surrey would questions why land was given over to golf courses, like Camberley Heath golf course (pictured) The Lib Dems are committed to building 300,000 new homes every year if they are returned to power at the next election. Mr Cable said it was a 'cliche' to rely on brownfield land for new developments and insisted there must be a focus on using up agricultural land. He added: 'Most people do want green, they want green but they would rather have it outside their own house than sitting 20 miles away where they have no access to it.' The Lib Dem said new housing was being focused on the south east because 'people are not flocking to Burnley'. He suggested there would need to be for central government to drive new development rather than leave it to local areas otherwise it would not happen. 'We are going to need that element of stick as well as carrot,' he said. But Mr Cable defended so-called nimbys - residents who declare 'not in my backyard' - insisting their desire to protect the area around their homes was 'totally rational'. 'When you create an environment in which the most important thing is somebody's life is their home and its value... then people are going to fight to the the last ditch to stop those values being affected.' This week Mr Cable called for more public borrowing by central and local government to finance productive investment in transport, housing and innovation.","Business Secretary says families in Surrey would rather have homes .

"It is the start of the Chinese Lunar New Year and the Year of the Sheep is being celebrated in style around the world. Locals and visitors alike have taken to the streets, particularly in countries where it is a public holiday, like Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia. Known as Tet in Vietnam and Seollal in South Korea, the 40-day festival is traditionally a time to be with family but involves spectacular dances, dangerous stunts and the traditional gifting of hong bao packets. Scroll down for videos . To celebrate the Chinese Lunar New Year, models donned traditional costumes in Malang City, East Java province, in Indonesia . Though Buddhists are a minority in the predominantly Islamic Indonesia, the celebration is still widely observed in the bigger cities .

Tibetan monks perform their ritual prayers on the first day of the Lunar New Year at the Yonghegong Lama Temple in Beijing, China . Dating back as far as the 14th century, this year's celebrations will mark the beginning of year 4713 on the Chinese calendar. It marks the beginning of a new agricultural season, as well as a new year, and is considered a time to reunite and take part in traditions intended to bring good fortune over the coming 12 months. In China, this period is also known as the Spring Festival, and traditionally, it kicks off with a large meal known as the reunion dinner where dumplings and fish are served as symbols of prosperity. Families take great care to be together on this night, which is usually held on New Year's Eve.

The celebrations can get quite loud, as evidenced by this adorable girl covering her ears in Manila's Chinatown district on Thursday . Many cities put up colourful decorations for the season and engage in celebratory parades, dancing Chinese dragons, and fire displays. The colour red is most often used, as the hue is believed to ward off evil and is associated with luck. It's also customary to wear new red clothes to symbolise a new start. The burning paper money as an offering to ancestors is also traditional New Year activity in some areas. This year, the Tibetan New Year also falls on February 19, the same day as the Chinese Lunar New Year, which the autonomous region celebrated with a fireworks display above the Potala Palace. Red decorations traditionally signify good luck and prosperity. Here, red lanterns are hung in the Manila Chinatown district of Binondo . Filipinos try to catch sweets and other prizes being thrown at them, following a dragon and lion dance performance, in Manila .

Here, Chinese Filipinos pray at the Seng Guan Temple during the celebration of the Lunar New Year in the Chinese district of Binondo, Manila . People also exchange red packets, called 'hong bao,' to celebrate, which children often open on New Year's Eve. These contain 'lucky' cash. Each country, however, typically has its own traditional foods for the celebration. One commonality is the idea of 'out with the old and in with the new.' In the lead up to the celebrations, houses are cleaned from top to bottom, with some Chinese people even taking a bath in pomelo leaves to enhance their prosperity further. Following such a bath, it's also traditional not to wash your hair during the initial days of the new year so as to not risk washing out any of your newly acquired good luck. Though widely referred to as the year of the sheep, 2015 is also known as the year of the goat, because the Chinese character is the same for both.","Today marks the beginning of the Lunar New Year and the Year of the Sheep (also known as the Year of the Goat)

"Lewis Hamilton believes his spin on lap 28 of the Brazilian Grand Prix cost him victory. Hamilton, who was bidding to leapfrog Nico Rosberg during the second round of pit-stops, posted the fastest lap of the race, but then lost control of his Mercedes under braking at Turn 4 on the following lap – the incident cost him six seconds. While the Briton managed to reel Rosberg back in, he was unable to pass his team-mate meaning the gap between the championship rivals now stands at 17 points ahead of the title decider in Abu Dhabi in a fortnight’s time.

I thought I was going to pit at the end of that lap so I had used up everything in the tyres and on the next lap I had nothing left. ‘I made a mistake and locked the rears into Turn 4 and without the rotation it just spun me around - the second time it has happened this weekend.

"One thing Britain isn't short of is coastline, so when it comes to choosing our best beach, competition is tough. But holidaymakers have crowned Woolacombe Beach in Devon, with its long stretches of golden sand, the best in the UK. And the Devon hotspot has beaten off competition from Turkey, Spain and Greece to be named fourth best beach in Europe. Scroll down for video . With its dramatic coastline and pristine stretch of golden sand it's no wonder Woolacombe Beach in Devon has been named the best beach in the UK, and the fourth best beach in Europe . Oh we do like to be beside the seaside! Weymouth Beach in Dorset also beat stiff competition and was named the eighth best beach in Europe, and the second best beach in the UK after Woolacombe . Travellers on TripAdvisor voted Dorset's Weymouth Beach the second best in the UK and eighth in Europe. The two beaches meant that the UK has many hotspots listed in Europe's top 10 as Spain, Italy and Greece - three popular holiday destinations famed for their coastlines. Three other UK beaches were also featured in the list of the top 20 European beaches. Rhossili beach in Swansea was 11th place, St Brelade’s Bay beach in Jersey was 14th and Porthminster beach at St Ives in Cornwall came in at 18th on the list, which was dominated by the South of England. The only beach north of the border to make an appearance on the list of best UK beaches was hauntingly beautiful Luskentyre Beach on the Isle of Harris, which managed a respectable eighth place. Woolacombe Beach has knocked Rhossili off top spot this year in the UK rankings, with the Welsh destination now in third spot.

He told Monday Night Football: 'There's pressure on Van Persie, people want more from him. 'He's got to do better in long situations and needs to make better runs. But his team-mates aren't finding him as much as [Paul] Scholes and [Michael] Carrick were two years ago. 'I called him a burglar before - he lives off back of centre-backs. The type of pass he wants is into space.

"Marco Reus completed a hat-trick against Galatasaray on Tuesday night, despite scoring only once. The Borussia Dortmund star scored his side's first goal in the 4-1 win at the Westfalenstadion, and celebrated by covering his mouth with his hand. For iPhone users who may have kept an eye on the 25-year-old's form in recent weeks, the celebration completed a trio of emoji references. Marco Reus does the 'speak no evil' monkey emoji celebration after scoring against Galatasaray . Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp looks pensive before his side's Champions League game against Galatasaray . The three popular symbols - a symbol of a monkey covering his eyes, ears and mouth - have been Reus' celebration for his last three goals. Reus covered his ears on Saturday for his goal against Bayern Munich, covered his eyes for the strike against St Pauli last week and completed the hat-trick on Tuesday. The symbols, a play on the phrase 'hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil' are among the most popular emojis used on the iPhone. 'Hear no evil'... the celebration the German performed against Bayern Munich at the weekend . Dortmund applaud their fans at the Westfalenstadion after their comprehensive 4-1 victory over Galatasaray . It remains to be seen whether Reus will continue the trend by emulating another emoji symbol, but despite it being all smiles in Europe, his side are struggling in the Bundesliga. They have qualified from their Champions League group with ease and should top the standings after Arsenal squandered a three-goal lead against Anderlecht. But domestically Jurgen Klopp's side are joint bottom with just two wins in 10 games. They face third-place Borussia Monchengladbach on Sunday at the Westfalenstadion. 'See no evil'...

"British scientists have revealed how they reconstructed the face of one of Henry VIII’s elite archers who drowned when the Mary Rose sank in 1545. The team from Swansea University worked with a Swedish expert, Oscar Nilsson, to reconstruct the face of the man. They used 3D scanning and printing - as well as modern forensic techniques - to analyse several skulls recovered from the Mary Rose and make a replica of one. A team from Swansea University has used 3D scanning and printing to recreate the face of a man who drowned when the Mary Rose sank in 1545 . Mr Nilsson then took over the reconstruction and built up the man’s face muscle by muscle. From studying the face and skeleton, the team have established a number of things about the man. They believe that he was an archer because his skeleton shows evidence of repetitive stress injuries from pulling a longbow. They also believe that he was of high rank because he was found with an ivory armguard, a silver ring and a bag containing a pewter plate. He was more than six feet tall and was in his 20s or 30s. The work is part of a wider project involving Swansea University and the Mary Rose Trust. They started by studying the skulls that had been taken from the wreckage of the Mary Rose and deciding which one to reconstruct . They then scanned and analysed the skull before using 3D printing technology to create an exact replica of it. The reconstruction was then built up muscle by muscle . The researchers believe that the man (whose skull is shown as a 3D scan) was an archer who was six feet tall and in his 20s or 30s. They also think he was of high rank because he was found with valuable objects . When the warship was raised from the Solent in 1982, 92 fairly complete skeletons of the crew were recovered. Ten skulls were taken to Swansea University for analysis, including the skull of the man whose face has been reconstructed. Nick Owen, a sport and exercise biomechanist at the College of Engineering, which has led the Swansea work on the project, said: ‘Archers were the only professional soldiers of their day. So it is very likely that this is the face of one of Henry VIII’s elite troops. ‘What’s so exciting is that we can reveal the face of a man who has been hidden from history. We wouldn’t have portraits of him, as we do for wealthy and powerful people from the past – for example we’d already seen the face of Richard III on paintings before his remains were discovered. ‘This is a face of an ordinary man, albeit in a crack regiment, and he hasn’t been seen for almost 500 years. The researchers scanned the original skull using a 3D laser scanner - this gave an exact three-dimensional virtual replica. They then 'printed' an exact copy of the skull (pictured), using a 3D printer . ‘Thanks to 21st century technology and expertise, we can bring him vividly back to life, and understand more about his world.’ Mr Owen explained the steps involved in producing the reconstruction: ‘The key objective was to produce a replica of the skull, but without damaging it. ‘First we scanned the original skull using a 3D laser scanner. This gave us an exact three-dimensional virtual replica of the skull. ‘The computer image was then given to Swansea University’s ASTUTE group to “print” an exact copy of the skull, using a 3D printer. The group normally use this type of technology to develop rapid prototypes of new products for companies. Printing took 48 hours altogether. ‘We then gave the 3D copy of the skull to Oscar Nilsson, an expert in facial reconstruction. Using his expertise in forensics, his knowledge of anatomy and tissue depth, and his artistic abilities, he was able to build up the face muscle by muscle.’ The reconstructed face, along with many other artefacts from the Mary Rose, is on display in the new Mary Rose Museum in Portsmouth. When the warship was raised from the Solent in 1982, 92 fairly complete skeletons of crew members were recovered. The team also studied these bones for clues about the ship's crew . The reconstructed face, along with many other artefacts from the Mary Rose, is on display in the new Mary Rose Museum in Portsmouth . The team also studied a longbow recovered from the ship - it is believed that this is the sort of weapon used by the reconstructed archer . The 16th-century warship Mary Rose has been undergoing a meticulous programme of conservation since it was lifted from the seabed more than 30 years ago. Ever since the hull of Henry VIII's flagship was raised in October 1982, it has been constantly sprayed with millions of litres of water and wax chemicals to preserve it. At first, the hull was sprayed with recycled, fresh water at a temperature of less than 5C (41F) to stop the wood drying out and to inhibit bacterial activity. The hull had been preserved under the sea as it had been embedded in mud preventing bacteria and tides from eroding it. An artist's depiction of the sinking of the HMS Mary Rose . In 1985, the ship was turned upright and titanium props were installed to support the internal structure and work was undertaken to remove as much sediment as possible. From 1994, active conservation commenced with the spraying of Polyethylene Glycol (Peg), a water-soluble polymer which can penetrate deep into the wood and support the cell walls. And just last month, on April 29, the Peg sprays were turned off and the hull will begin its final air-drying phase to remove 100 tonnes of water during the next four to five years. Visitors to the new museum will be able to view the hull through windows into the airtight chamber as it undergoes this final stage of conservation. The Mary Rose Museum has worked closely with the team behind the Swedish warship Vasa which has used a similar highly-sophisticated drying process. Once drying is complete in 2017, the internal walls surrounding the hull will be removed and visitors will be able to see a completely unobstructed view of the hull. Mark Jones, head of conservation at the Mary Rose Trust, said: 'The conservation of Henry VIII's warship Mary Rose has been one of the largest and most complex programmes of this type ever undertaken. 'It really will be a unique chance for visitors to see our dedicated team preserve such a treasured artefact as they can see through windows into the 'hotbox' containing the Mary Rose when the new museum opens.'","Used 3D scanning and printing to create an exact replica of the man's skull .

"Real Madrid star Gareth Bale has hailed former club Southampton for propelling him to the top of the game. The Galatico paid tribute to the south coast side’s highly successful youth system, where he started his career, as the Saints open a new £30million training complex on Wednesday. Southampton’s academy has unearthed a host of top talent in recent years and Bale, who joined in 1999 before leaving for Tottenham in 2007, felt his time at the Saints was the best education in football. Real Madrid star Gareth Bale, in action against Liverpool on Tuesday, is grateful for his time at Southampton . Bale, in a video paying tribute to Southampton's academy, lauded their youth set up on the south coast . The Welshman had two seasons in the Southampton first team before moving to Tottenham in 2007 . ‘Without being there, I don’t think I would be where I am today,’ Bale told Southampton’s official YouTube channel. ‘Since I was nine they looked after me. They really do take care of every step in your career and, for me, being at Southampton was the best education in football. ‘It’s probably the only club that can consistently produce young players like that. It’s a credit to everybody at the club.’ Bale hailed his start at Southampton, who he joined back in 1999, as the best education in football . Arsenal forward Theo Walcott was also on hand to praise the Southampton academy in the video . Walcott, celebrating scoring for the Saints, spent five years in the Southampton academy between 2000-2005 . Household names such as Arsenal’s trio Theo Walcott, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Calum Chambers are products of Southampton’s youth academy, along with the likes of Adam Lallana at Liverpool and Luke Shaw now at Manchester United. Theo Walcott told Southampton’s Youtube channel ‘I would sum up my time at Southampton as one of the best decisions of my life. ‘They just know how to develop players, they never stop. They gave me an opportunity to show what I can do at such a young age. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (left) and Luke Shaw (right) are both products of Southampton's youth set up . ‘Even if players move on, they have the right coaching staff just to develop the next one coming through.’ Ronald Koeman’s side are currently second in the Premier League after a superb start to the season, despite an exodus of their top players this summer.

"Pictures of Nigel Farage drinking in pubs with mystery women on his arm is part of what makes Britain great, Gordon Brown claimed today as he attacked UKIP for fuelling fears about globalisation. The former Prime Minister mocked Mr Farage’s image as a drinking, womanising populist who fuels fears about globalisation. Mr Brown insisted the rise of UKIP – topping the European elections last month – was not the result of public anger over immigration or Europe, but fears about the ‘juggernaut’ of global change and Britain’s place in the world. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown warned Labour against thinking the rise of UKIP was the result of anger over immigration or Europe . The Labour party is divided about how to respond to the threat from UKIP after seeing support switch in heartland working class seats in the north. Work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves warned that blue-collar supporters felt UKIP understood their fears better while Yvette Cooper insisted: ‘We can’t imitate UKIP, we have got to take them on.’ But despite being part of the Labour government which opened the doors to eastern Europe and handed more powers to Brussels, Mr Brown claimed Labour had to make the case for opening up the British economy to rest of the world. And he ridiculed Mr Farage, who has often been pictured drinking in pubs and last week faced questions after returning to his hotel at a tourism conference in Malta at 4am with an attractive  woman. Mr Farage dismissed allegations of inappropriate behaviour as ‘fluff and nonsense’, saying: ‘I didn’t go to bed with her.’ Speaking at press gallery lunch in Parliament, Mr Brown said: ‘Britain cannot be Britain without seeing a photograph of Nigel Farage with a pint in his hand and a mystery woman lady in the other hand.’ He went on: ‘Britain cannot be Britain these days, a new permanent fixture by the way, without the Liberals coming in sixth place. ‘Britain cannot be Britain unless at some point you have a Scottish as well as welsh or northern Irish prime minister and not simply English Prime Minister. Mr Brown joked that part of Britain was Nigel Farage's love of drinking and Nick Clegg's Lib Dems now finishing sixth in elections, after woeful results in the European elections and Newark by-election . ‘Britain cannot be Britain without Scotland being part of the United Kingdom and without Scotland Britain will not be Britain. We rub together. Scottish assertiveness, sometimes English indifference. ‘There is a difference, and there is aggression but Scotland and Britain go together and I don’t want to see a future where the four nations of this United Kingdom at a time when the world is becoming more integrated, societies are talking about interdependence and when it’s absolutely important that we have co-operation in the future.’ He warned Labour leader Ed Miliband must not respond to UKI with tougher policies on migrant workers or the EU. Instead Labour must make the case for Britain working more closely with foreign countries. ‘For me this is an issue about global change. People say it’s an issue about immigration and it’s an issue an issue about Europe. ‘But it’s about how we respond, and who gets the benefit from these massive changes, this juggernaut that is taking place as a result of the opening up of the global economy.’ Mr Brown joked that he had been at a meeting at the International Monetary Fund where protestors outside were carrying a banner declaring: ‘Worldwide campaign against globalisation.’ He went on: ‘You know exactly what people meant. People feel that this alien to them. People feel that its unfriendly, people feel that they cannot control the process of change, and it’s about time that we showed that globalisation – that is the big processes of opening up the global economy – has a human face. ‘I frankly thought that when we had the G20 in 2009 and with Barack Obama as President we would be able to do this, we would be able to show that you can manage globalisation in the interests of people. ‘But the retreat from global co-operation in the last few years makes it very difficult. ‘We have got to show for skilled workers, or people worried about skills, people who are worried about their security, people who are on low pay, that there is a future for their children that is more about skills security and decent employment. ‘It seems to me that that is the answer to UKIP as it is the answer to Scottish nationalism.’","Former Prime Minister teases Nigel Farage over his populist image .

"Spain coach Vicente del Bosque insists Diego Costa will not be risked if they have any doubts about the Chelsea striker's fitness after calling him up for next week's European Championship qualifiers. Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho would have preferred to see Costa rested for the matches against Slovakia and Luxembourg so the in-form forward could receive treatment on his hamstring. Costa has been in prolific goalscoring form since his £32million summer move to Stamford Bridge but Mourinho revealed last week that the former Atletico Madrid man was barely training for fear of exacerbating his hamstring problems. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Mourinho shares his concerns about Costa's fitness . Diego Costa has been selected by Spain for their next Euro 2016 qualifiers despite struggling with an injury . The Spain squad in full for the games against Slovakia and Luxembourg next week . Costa and Co were dumped out of the World Cup in Brazil after losing to Holland and Chile . However, Costa said on Wednesday he had no intention of skipping Spain duty and on Friday he was included in Del Bosque's 23-man squad. Del Bosque, though, says he will not take any risks with the 25-year-old, just like he would not with any other player. He told a press conference: 'When we call up someone it's because we believe he's fit to play. He's been playing in all the (Chelsea) games and if he comes and isn't in condition to play, we won't force him, as has always been the case with all our players. 'We always take into account the physical state of the players. We don't force anybody, we've never obliged anybody to play. 'The medical team will decide on these things.' Costa has been in sparkling form for Chelsea in the Premier League so far this season . As well as Costa, Del Bosque has recalled Gerard Pique and included uncapped duo Rodrigo Moreno and Juan Bernat in his squad. Barca defender Pique has been drafted back in after missing the opening Euro 2016 qualifier against Macedonia. Del Bosque said of Pique: 'If he had been fit for the previous squad he would have come. I think it is more important that we have faith in him and he always been committed to the team.' 'We always look only at the sporting side of things. He has been with us for a long time. We will have a look at his condition and he will be useful for the team. 'We think he has been playing enough and he has recovered from his back problem. He is a useful player for us.' Bayern Munich left back Juan Bernat is a new face for Vicente del Bosque in the Spain set-up . The Spain coach also highlighted the versatility of the two new comers, forward Rodrigo, who is on loan at Valencia from Benfica, and Bayern Munich wing-back Juan Bernat. He said: 'They have both been playing very well and have been in the Under-21s. 'Because of Bernat's qualities we think he can play either at the back or in a more advanced position on the left. Rodrigo has also played on the right wing or as a second striker at Valencia. 'Both should be national team players for years to come.' Two-time reigning European champions Spain, who beat Macedonia 5-1 in their first competitive match since their miserable World Cup defence this summer, go to Slovakia on October 9 and then travel to Luxembourg three days later. Del Bosque added: 'We need to be very careful because now it's very difficult to beat any team. 'Slovakia have already won in Ukraine and Luxembourg are not the same as years ago, when you could expect to thrash them. We have to take care as they could cause problems.'

"1. Lewis Hamilton - 334 points . 2. Nico Rosberg - 317 points . Lewis Hamilton will be crowned world champion if he finishes second in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Sunday week, even if Nico Rosberg wins the race. If the final race was a ‘normal’ race with 25 points for the winner, rather than the double points on offer, Hamilton would be able to claim his second drivers’ title with a sixth-place finish. Lewis Hamilton was hurtling along the high road of history – or at least the Reta Oposta, the 200mph back straight at Interlagos – when his car slunk off the track and his world championship bid itself wobbled. The upshot was victory at the Brazilian Grand Prix for Nico Rosberg, second for Hamilton – and the increased likelihood of the greatest prize in motor racing being decided by the distorted mathematics of double scoring in the final round at Abu Dhabi. Hamilton’s lead over Rosberg is a slender 17 points after what unfolded as he arrived off the lightning-quick straight into the fourth turn, Descida do Lago. He was screwing every last millisecond out of his Mercedes. But such pyrotechnical gung-ho was beyond the grip of his battered tyres and he twirled on to the green run-off area. He had just put in the then-fastest lap of the race as Rosberg pitted. He stayed out for another ‘hot lap’ – a mistake in hindsight – in the hope of emerging from his own stop ahead of his rival. Some number crunchers said he was on target to accomplish the feat but for the spin. ‘Sorry guys,’ said Hamilton over the radio. He did not point the finger afterwards either, saying: ‘Nobody’s fault but mine. I would have won but for the mistake. I clearly had more pace than Nico today.’ Nico Rosberg celebrates on the podium at the Brazilian Grand Prix after claiming his fifth win of the season and first since July 20 . Rosberg hurls his trophy into the air as Hamilton is awarded his trophy for second place - the Brit now leads Rosberg by 17 points . Rosberg locks up in front of second-placed Hamilton during the Brazilian Grand Prix as the Mercedes pair tussled until the very end . The view from Hamilton's car as he spins off the track on lap 28. The incident cost Hamilton six seconds and potentially the race victory . Hamilton was trying to gain an advantage on Rosberg, who was in the pits, but pushed too hard and ended up in the  run-off area . 1 Nico Rosberg (Mercedes) 1:30:2.555 . 2 Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) 1:30:4.012 . 3 Felipe Massa (Williams) 1:30:43.586 . 4 Jenson Button (McLaren) 1:30:51.213 . 5 Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) 1:30:53.975 . 6 Fernando Alonso (Ferrari) 1:31:4.461 . 7 Kimi Raikkonen (Ferrari) 1:31:6.285 . 8 Nico Hulkenberg (Force India) 1:31:6.489 . 9 Kevin Magnussen (McLaren) 1:31:12.640 . 10 Valtteri Bottas (Williams) +1 Lap . 11 Daniil Kvyat (Toro Rosso) +1 Lap . 12 Pastor Maldonado (Lotus) +1 Lap . 13 Jean-Éric Vergne (Toro Rosso) +1 Lap . 14 Esteban Gutierrez (Sauber) +1 Lap . 15 Sergio Perez (Force India) +1 Lap . 16 Adrian Sutil (Sauber) +1 Lap . 17 Romain Grosjean (Lotus) Retired, 63 Laps . 18 Daniel Ricciardo (Red Bull) Retired, 39 Laps . It was impossible at the pivotal moment in the race not to think back to Shanghai during his debut season when, with the title at his mercy, he stayed out too long on fading tyres and ran off as he finally entered the pits. Unlike then, though, he could at least fight on to push the winner all the way. Rosberg’s victory under pressure was his first since July and probably the finest of his career. Game competitor he is, Hamilton, who was also hampered by a slightly slow second stop, went from about seven seconds adrift after the spin to five seconds back at the halfway stage. Soon he was right on Rosberg’s tail. This was now a majestic battle over the undulating 2.67 mile track. They both posted fastest times. Rosberg was blindingly quick but, for lap after lap, in imminent danger from Hamilton applying the DRS overtaking device. A warning came from the pit wall to Hamilton: ‘Think about protecting that right rear, Lewis. It is definitely getting hot.’ Still, Hamilton loomed large in Rosberg’s mirror. Rosberg celebrates as he's greeted by the Mercedes team following his win over team-mate Hamilton . The tale of two team-mates; Hamilton must repeat his second placed finish in Abu Dhabi to be sure of denying Rosberg the title . Hamilton sprays third-placed Massa with champagne as celebrations get into full swing . So it came down to the last lap. The tension was excruciating. Had Hamilton bided his time, and was he now ready to pounce? It was not to be, and Rosberg duly held on. So where does this leave the title? With Archimedes required, that’s where. But, seriously, if Rosberg wins in the final round in Abu Dhabi a fortnight hence, Hamilton must finish second to claim the title; if Rosberg is second, Hamilton must finish fifth; if Rosberg is third, Hamilton must finish sixth. Mercedes boss Toto Wolff, flushed with success after a record-breaking 11 one-two finishes for Mercedes (beating Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna’s McLaren best in 1988), has few cares but even he knows the double scoring is a rum do. ‘I do hope that it is not decided by a mechanical DNF because that would cast a shadow over the championship,’ Wolff admitted, before adding: ‘We all knew the rules at the start of the season, and If Rosberg has most points at the end of the season he will be a worthy champion. You have to be pragmatic.’ The heat of Sao Paulo wreaked havoc as teams battled to manage their tyres. Rain was predicted, but never came . Another shame is that the final race will be staged in a soulless palace in the desert. Sao Paulo on Sunday presented a stark contrast. The grid was alive with fever, and it went from there. The local favourite arrived to his starting box to chants of ‘Massa, Massa’. Back at the garage Felipe Massa’s father, wearing some Dame Edna-lite blue glasses, watched on from the spot where he celebrated his son’s championship that never was: the race Massa won in 2008 only for Hamilton to win the title in the last pulsating yards. But sadly for the home contingent their man was given a five-second stop-go penalty for speeding in the pit lane. Worse followed. He pulled into the wrong pit box for his third stop and had to be waved into the correct parking space. But he was not greatly damaged by the miscalculation and finished third. He took to the podium with a wide smile. Jenson Button was impressive again, finishing fourth to his McLaren team-mate Kevin Magnussen’s ninth. Are his bosses getting rid of the wrong man? Will the evidence – Button has scored 106 points against Magnussen’s 55 – sway them into a change of mind? ‘I’m not ready to stop racing,’ said Button. Rosberg leads Hamilton and  Massa through the opening corners on the first lap of the race . The field get off to a clean start in the blazing sun of Sao Paulo on Sunday . Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo before he was forced to retire from the race on his 40th lap . Again, the off-track noise was as ear-splitting as the old V8 engines. The smaller teams – or the uncompetitive ones, as Bernie Ecclestone calls them – want more money from the sport’s billion-pound pot. They say they cannot survive without it. ‘Gordon Gekko said greed was good and look what happened to him – he went to jail,’ ventured Gerard Lopez of Lotus, one of the disgruntled teams along with Force India and Sauber. ‘This is a £1.6billion business and teams are going to the wall for the sake of a couple of tens of millions.

"Four months, fourteen miles and a change of surface separate Wimbledon from this week’s proceedings at the 02 Arena but not much seemed to have altered on Sunday for Andy Murray. Having played a strangely lacklustre match on his last appearance in London – the quarter final defeat to Grigor Dimitrov at SW19 – he lobbed in a similarly curious performance to open the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals. Except this one was even worse. Whereas the Bulgarian had excelled beyond himself on that summer afternoon Kei Nishikori did not even have to produce his best to win 6-4 6-4 and jeopardise Murray’s hopes for this week at the 02 Arena. VIDEO Scroll down for Andy Murray: I don't go into every match expecting to win . Kei Nishikori won the first set 6-4 and began the second strongly, racing into a 3-0 advantage . Andy Murray fought back to level 4-4, but was unable to carry on his momentum against Nishikori . Now he will surely have to win both his last two matches, starting tomorrow against Canada’s Milos Raonic, who let slip a set point on Sunday night before going down 6-1 7-6 to a determined Roger Federer in the second match of Group B. Before subsiding 7-0 in the tiebreak the big-serving Raonic caused the Swiss master sufficient problems to reinforce how dangerous he is. Like Nishikori, he was making his debut at this tournament and was nervous at the start. Unlike the Japanese player he was up against an opponent in Federer who was ruthlessly sharp enough to take advantage from the off, rather than Murray, who was reluctant to take the initiative. Roger Federer returns a forehand in his opening ATP World Tour Finals match against Milos Raonic in London . Federer celebrates winning a point during the opening set while Milos Raonic puts the work in to make a return . Both opening matches drew an excess of 17,000 spectators, and those who packed the venue to its dimly-lit rafters for the first session were to be reminded of an eternal truth about the 27 year-old Scot: for all his career achievements you are still never quite sure what you are going to get with him. Not much, it turned out, on this occasion. He was desperately vulnerable on his serve and stuck so far back behind the baseline in the rallies there was a danger of him incurring a fee for parking. Surprisingly sanguine afterwards, he dismissed the notion that the left calf muscle he had treated might have been a factor. 'I felt okay on the court today, I don’t think that was the reason I lost the match,' said Murray. 'If this was anywhere else I would be out of the tournament. I’m definitely going to have to play better if I am going to get through.' Nishikori had never beat Murray before today and the Japanese managed to silence his fans in London . The Japanese player was not hugely better than Murray, but he stifled the Scotsman's resurgence to beat him . All his supporters can hope for now is that, with back to the wall, he shows the same resolve that drove him to play six consecutive weeks in Asia and Europe to qualify for this eight-man field in the first place. You suspect he instinctively prefers to be in that situation anyway as he has never been a great front runner, which is what he might have considered himself to be against 02 new boy Nishikori. Murray’s demeanour was certainly flat, despite the fact that he was given a rousing enough welcome, and his second serve took particular punishment. He denied afterwards suggestions on Sunday from Greg Rusedski that he has made deliberate if subtle changes to his action since back surgery: 'I wouldn’t have intentionally changed serve because I wasn’t getting any problems with my back from my service action,' he said. 'At the end of the year I will look at video from before and now to see if things have evolved.' Nishikori capitalised upon numerous mistakes on Murray's second serve, as Murray failed to settle . Murray fought back form 3-0 to 4-4 in the second set, but was unable to continue to build his momentum . He is bound to be aware of minor changes in his ball toss already, and it is something he will have to review with head coach Amelie Mauresmo, who also has to fathom out a complex temperament that leaves him so prone to letdowns. In his previous match, against Novak Djokovic in Paris ten days ago, he competed well before mentally tuning out and collapsing in the last five games. There was no sign of the resourcefulness or fight that carried him to three ATP titles in six weeks, and also absent was any of the all-court attacking intent she would like to instil in him. Nishikori was there for the taking early on and could not a land a first serve in. He pretty much gifted Murray a break to fall 3-2 behind but then had the donation reciprocated straightaway before the first set was dismally conceded. Murray's next games are against Roger Federer and Milos Raonic and he will have to play much better . A brief glimpse of attacking purpose was given when Murray got back from 1-4 to 4-4 in the second, but he was broken again to lose the match with a backhand that went almost embarrassingly long beyond the baseline. A curious performance indeed. Further down the scale, British number two James Ward narrowly missed out on entering the world’s top 100 for the first time when he lost 6-4 6-1 to Australian John Millman in final of the ATP Challenger in Melbourne. The 27 year-old Londoner, who has now ended his season, is likely to go up to around 102 in the new rankings and already should be assured of a direct entry into January’s Australian Open.

"The British government drew up plans to whisk Colonel Gaddafi out of Libya and allow him to live out his days in another African country, it was reported last night. The MI6 plan would have placed the dictator ‘in retirement’ and out of the reach of international law in oil-rich Equatorial Guinea. It was regarded as an option for ending the devastation and loss of life during the rebel uprising and subsequent international assault by Nato forces including Britain in 2011. History: Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair meeting Colonel Muammar Gaddafi back in 2007 - it has been revealed that Britain planned to take Gaddafi out of Libya . Flying in: Then Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell had visited Libya to discuss options for Gaddafi . During the fighting, Andrew Mitchell, the then International Development Secretary, went to the notoriously corrupt West African country to build contacts with the regime, it was reported. When contacted by the Mail last night Mr Mitchell declined to comment. However it is known that he attended an African Union meeting in Equatorial Guinea on behalf of the Government to drum up support for its policy on intervention in Libya. The conference took place in June 2011 in the capital, Malabo. Asked last night about the report, an intelligence source conceded he was ‘not unfamiliar’ with the suggestion of such a plan. The belief at the time was that it was an option that Equatorial Guinea might have been prepared to accept. Members of Gaddafi’s immediate family, including his second wife and three children, fled to Algeria during the conflict carrying some of the regime’s vast wealth in gold bars. Bad memories: The sky filled with billowing smoke was a constant visual during the Libyan troubles of 2011 . Horror: One of the burnt out buildings of Tripoli street brings back harsh memories of the Libyan troubles . As the conflict ended, Gaddafi disappeared only to be killed in October 2011 as he tried to flee to neighbouring Niger. The details of the Gaddafi exit strategy are disclosed in ‘In It Together’ by Matthew d’Ancona about the Coalition Government. The book is being serialised by the Daily Telegraph. He writes that the plan was drawn up during the bombing campaign by US, British, French and other forces in the aftermath of the Arab Spring. British officials considered whether he could remain in Libya but this was ruled out because it would face opposition from rebels on the National Transitional Council. He writes: ‘There were signs that the Colonel might accept some form of internal exile - as long as he were allowed an adequate protection force to ensure his security.’ ‘Not surprisingly, this was dismissed as impractical.’ The Cabinet Office and MI6 then ‘prepared an exit strategy for Gaddafi in case it was necessary to strike a deal and to end the conflict.’ All over: Video footage showed the final few moments in the life of Gaddafi . Equatorial Guinea ‘was chosen as a prospective retirement home’. Mr Mitchell, the book claims, ‘was able to assist the officials tasked with these delicate contingency plans, helping make the necessary contacts in the capital, Malabo, and elsewhere’. The 50-car convoy carrying Gaddafi and his retinue was bombed by French fighter planes and then cornered by rebel fighters. The dictator was tortured and killed. It has been claimed that he was under escort from a group of South African mercenaries at the time, and that the escape attempt had the tacit support of Western countries. Libya at war: The uprising against Gaddafi ended up involving Nato - and it has now been revealed Britain planned to whisk the dictator to a 'safe haven' Victory: Rebels waged a determined fight against the Libyan leader, and ended up getting what they wanted . Equatorial Guinea was the subject of an attempted coup in 2004 led by the old Etonian Simon Mann. The so-called ‘Wonga Coup’ was disrupted when a group of mercenaries was arrested in Zimbabwe prior to entering the country. Had Gaddafi made it to Equatorial Guinea, international prosecutors would have been unable to put him on trial for the abuses against his people during his 42-year reign. Placing dictators in ‘retirement’ is not without precedent. Idi Amin, the Ugandan dictator, fled his country in 1979 and lived out the rest of his life in Saudi Arabia .","Andrew Mitchell began to 'build contacts' with the regime .

"Spirits will be low among members of the Scottish National Party after the majority of their country voted no in the Independence referendum last week. But Angela Constance attempted to brighten up her colleagues' afternoon with a pair of bizarre shoes for her working day. The Cabinet Secretary for Training, Youth and Women's Employment wore a pair of £125 'Bambi Deer' high heels from British shoe company Irregular Choice as she entered Holyrood parliament. Member of Scottish Parliament Angela Constance wore a pair of 'Cherry Deer' heels from Irregular Choice to work today . Angela, who is the MSP for Almond Valley, isn't alone in her love for the quirky footwear. The heels have taken on a cult following since they were first launched into the market in 2010. An Irregular Choice spokesperson said: 'The 'Cherry Deer' heels are one of our best sellers, they sell out every month. 'We've done the same style with unicorns, dogs and toy heads in the heels instead but these are very popular. The quirky design is one of British shoe company Irregular Choice's most popular items. They retail at £125 . 'Our audience is so varied, we have customers from between the ages of 15 to 60 years old. 'Often a mum will take her daughter into a shop and leave with a pair from the collection too. 'Because the designer himself Dan Sullivan designs 300 pairs a season, so that's 600 pairs a year, there is such a range for people to choose from. 'It has been a family-run business from the start, even his mother and father have been involved from the very beginning. Angela Constance appeared pleased with her fashion choice as she entered Holyrood parliament . 'So while it's success has turned Irregular Choice into more of a lifestyle brand these days, with everything from shoes to handbags and jewelry, they have kept the aim the same. 'The ethos was always to inspire people to be different - to choose something a little different from what they usually would. 'These new pictures of Angela prove that is still very much the case.'","Angela is Cabinet Secretary for Training, Youth and Women's Employment .

"CLICK HERE to read the full match report from Old Trafford . Little more than 24 hours after claiming to take a more cerebral approach to football management than his contemporaries, Louis van Gaal suddenly developed a previously undetected degree of modesty. It revealed itself after he was asked, in the wake of the win over Crystal Palace, if he had a clear vision of what was required to rebuild Manchester United — a task he said on Friday could take him three years. ‘When I say I have a clear vision I’m considered arrogant,’ he said. ‘But when you see what I have done in my career you have to know that I have a vision and that I’m very confident. I don’t think that is arrogant. It is self-confidence. It’s a big challenge but I knew that in advance. Otherwise I could have chosen another club.’ Right now the challenge seems a daunting one, particularly when he has to keep tinkering with his team to carve out the results that are just about keeping them in contention for the Champions League places. VIDEO Scroll down for Louis van Gaal: We are two points from fourth, it is in our hands . Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal accepts that he has had to change tactics too often . Juan Mata'strike earned Manchester United a 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace on Saturday . David de Gea kept his 50th clean sheet on his 144th appearance for United. If he had an idea of how United would play at the start of the season, circumstances have forced Van Gaal to adapt. On Saturday he unveiled the third formation in only 12 games in charge, with Wayne Rooney in central midfield alongside Marouane Fellaini in a 4-1-4-1 line-up that had Michael Carrick deployed in front of a makeshift back four. On a day when Daley Blind and Patrick McNair were partnered in central defence, the extra protection provided by a five-man midfield ensured a first clean sheet in six games. But it numbed United’s potency in attack and that was something even Van Gaal acknowledged after Juan Mata’s deflected, 67th-minute goal had secured a stuttering victory. Wayne Rooney was handed a midfield role on his return as Van Gaal changed formation again . Angel di Maria was substituted after an ineffectual performance where he was denied space to dribble . Manchester United’s Marouane Fellaini was clearly held round the neck by Crystal Palace defender Damian Delaney as he jumped for a header in the area. Referee Chris Foy gave nothing. ‘It’s too much I think, I agree,’ he said of yet another formation change. ‘But I’m looking for the balance and when you see the last four matches, we have had more balance because we haven’t conceded many goals. But we don’t score so much. With the other system we scored a lot of goals. ‘I said at half-time to Rooney and Fellaini that you have to play higher up in support of Van Persie. I had to correct them.’ He might have corrected them but Angel Di Maria, so brilliant when he first arrived from Real Madrid, remained a subdued figure. Van Gaal hooked him, as he did the equally ineffective Adnan Januzaj. The Dutchman insisted it was a consequence of negative Palace tactics. Daley Blind (L) lined up in the centre of defence after playing most of his games in midfield . Michael Carrick (R) was given a holding role that helped United earn a rare clean sheet . ‘Di Maria has played in a very small space,’ he said. ‘He is a dribbler but sometimes you cannot dribble. You have to make it a passing game and Di Maria is not a player who wants to give a pass every time he gets the ball.’ A lack of balance will remain an issue until Van Gaal can add quality to his defence. But he takes some encouragement from the fact that his side are only two points adrift of the Champions League places despite a difficult start and despite the fact they have taken only 16 points from 11 games. United had 22 points at the same stage last season under David Moyes. ‘Of course we need to raise our level,’ he said. ‘But it’s also a matter of getting over a lot of injuries. I’ve never had so many injuries in my career. It’s crazy but it’s what I have to deal with.’ VIDEO Fourth place still in our hands - Van Gaal .","Manchester United defeated Crystal Palace 1-0 in the Premier League .

"Mario Balotelli looks set to start for Liverpool against Real Madrid, and his manager Brendan Rodgers will be hoping the striker takes in the form he's shown in training.

'But he's a goalscorer, so I don't see what all the fuss is about. He's not playing any different to how he did at City, the only difference is that now he's playing for a struggling team at the moment that can't score, and he doesn't get the chances – and he doesn't score.'

"A mother died after eating soup she made using one of the world’s deadliest mushrooms which she had unwittingly picked in her garden. Keen gardener Christina Hale found the death cap mushrooms beneath some mature oak and fir trees and mistook them for an edible type. In fact the fungus – Amanita phalloides – contains one of the most lethal of all toxins and is the most common cause of death in humans from mushroom poisoning. Just half a cap is enough to kill. Christina Hale, 57, accidentally picked death cap mushrooms (left, file photo) when foraging for fresh mushrooms to add to a tin of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup she was preparing for dinner . Mrs Hale, 57, added the ones she had . picked to a tin of Campbell’s Cream of Mushroom soup which she heated . and ate with her husband Jocelyn, an inquest heard yesterday. Shortly . afterwards they became ill with vomiting and diarrhoea. A doctor who visited their home in . Bridgwater, Somerset, the next day thought Mrs Hale had the norovirus, . and decided against sending her to hospital for fear of infecting other . patients. But the following day the couple, who . had four children between them, were taken to hospital where Mrs Hale . was put into intensive care. She died the next day after suffering . multiple organ failure. The death cap is the most dangerous mushroom, responsible for 95 per cent of all deaths from mushroom poisoning worldwide. The deaths of Roman Emperor Claudius in 54AD and Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI in 1740 are said to have been caused by eating death caps. Patients die from organ failure within a few days unless they have a kidney and liver transplant. Death caps are common across Europe and contain about 20 different poisons. The strength of the main poison, alpha-Amanitin, is not reduced by freezing or cooking. Mr Hale, a 49-year-old property . developer who had eaten less of the soup, survived. He told the inquest . in Taunton: ‘We had picked mushrooms before from the garden and put them . into mushroom soup. She hadn’t done it on her own before. 'I had a bowl . of soup that she had given me and then had stew. The wife didn’t like it . because it had butter beans in it so she had more soup. She made the . soup her main meal.’ Doctors say that even if Mrs Hale had . been taken to hospital within hours of consuming the mushrooms last . November, she had eaten so many it is unlikely she would have survived. She died at the Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton. West Somerset Coroner Michael Rose, . who recorded a verdict of misadventure, said: ‘One should never pick . mushrooms, particularly under trees, unless you know exactly what you . are picking. 'The problem with this mushroom is that if you do taste it, . it does not taste unpleasant.’ The death cap appears most commonly under oaks. It grows to between three and six inches high. Poisoning symptoms, including stomach . pain, vomiting and diarrhoea, tend to appear ten to 16 hours after . consumption, and can then ease. But the toxins continue to attack the . body and death typically occurs six to 16 days after consumption from . liver or kidney failure.","Christina Hale went mushroom-picking for the first time in November .

"Mario Balotelli had every reason to celebrate after ending his goal drought for Liverpool against Swansea on Wednesday night, and went to popular city restaurant San Carlo to toast his success.

"In a potentially threatening blow to California’s porn industry voters have passed a measure that will require condom use during production despite fear it could put Los Angeles’ porn industry dually under wrap. Passed by 55.9 per cent of voters on Tuesday, Measure B will additionally raise fees in adult film productions potentially driving out the industry from L.A., according to the ballot's opposition. 'The effect would be simply to have no . scenes, or much, much fewer scenes shot in Los Angeles,' John Stagliano, . also known as 'Buttman' who owns Evil Angel, one of the nation's top . porn production companies, told Buzz Feed before . the measure’s passing. Scroll down for video . Bundled up: Measure B, which passed by 55.9 per cent of voters, requires actors in Los Angeles' porn industry to wear condoms while also raising porn production costs in the city . Fees: A porn actress sits on the set of an adult movie shoot in California, one of many who will be affected by the mandate that also requires a public health permit and a permit fee . In addition to condoms promoting safer sex and preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, the measure would 'require producers of adult films to obtain a public health permit from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health and pay a permit fee' to fund its enforcement. Fear of those rising costs earned support against the measure by the Los Angeles Times in an editorial late last month. ‘Though it is well intentioned, requiring the use of condoms in adult movies is likely to stymie L.A. County government and bring little benefit to performers,’ the paper wrote. The measure, pressed by the AIDS . Healthcare Foundation, is modelled after similar health permits applied . to tattoo shops, massage parlours and bathhouses. Opposition: John Stagliano, owner of Evil Angel, one of the top porn production companies in the country, has rallied against the measure saying with its passing he may move his business outside the city . The paper sides with the promotion of . safe sex with a recent LA Times blog article reporting adult . film stars in Los Angeles County having higher rates of gonorrhea and . chlamydia than legal prostitutes in Nevada. The paper argues the promotion of condom use without . government force, however, fearing the measure could negatively effect an . estimated $1billion to $2billion industry. 'My general manager pointed out that it’s far more dangerous to play Little League baseball than it is to perform in porn without condoms. And it’s true,' Mr Stagliano argued to the Buzz Feed. 'I played Little League baseball, and I got hit in the head a few times. It was far more dangerous, and I risked more than I physically risked being in porn, and I did not get HIV from being in porn,' he said. With the measure's passing Mr Stagliano said he expects some scenes to go underground while he personally expects ‘to just shoot in other places.' Benefits: Supporters of the mandate argued its protection against STDs with a recent study finding that 28 per cent of 168 performers in Los Angeles County having gonorrhea, chlamydia or both . Siding with Mr Stagliano, last month performers Tera Patrick and Ron Jeremy argued in a public service announcement that since 2000 only six porn performers have tested positive for HIV. In comparison, with Measure B supporters likening condom use as way to protect workers in the workplace - much the same like helmets at construction sites - the actors argue that in the same time period over 60,000 Americans died from far more dangerous occupations. As the LA Times reported, 28 per cent of 168 performers tested were found having either gonorrhea or chlamydia or both diseases using research from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, the Johns . Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and UCLA. Responding to those numbers and a possible affect by the measure's passing, Evil Angel's general manager Christian Mann told the Times it 'does zero to ameliorate the spread of gonorrhea or chlamydia among this population.' Mr Stagliano says he and others plan to challenge the measure in court hopeful of an injunction. In opposition, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation hailed the measure's passing as a major victory in their fight against STDs, touting that 'taxpayers pay over $500,000 for every HIV Infection that ends in free clinics. 'Most performers have no health insurance!' they wrote on their Facebook page. Lot to think about: Voters at the L.A. County lifeguard headquarters are seen casting their vote not only for the Presidential race but to mandate condoms . Other concerns: Also on the ballot, arguing whether to maintain the state's death penalty, 54 per cent of voters checked in its favour despite concerns it is costing hundreds of millions of dollars unnecessarily . Softer stance: Voters in California also opted for a loosening of the state's 'three strike' rules against habitual criminals . Early voting results to proposition 34 showed a 54 per cent opposition to end its use. Campaigners . in favour of abolishing capital punishment had based their argument on . the question of cost rather than morality, saying the financially . troubled state could save hundreds of millions of dollars by instead . jailing the worst killers for life. While California voters appeared to . oppose ending the death penalty, they broadly approved another ballot . measure to soften the state's controversial 'three strikes' law, which . gives longer sentences to habitual criminals. The . 'three strikes' reform measure had received over 68 per cent of the . vote after two-thirds of the precincts had declared, and organisers . declared victory. The . proposition would let some criminals who have been in jail twice avoid a . 25 years to life sentence for a third crime if it is judged to be . non-violent and non-serious. Supporters . of the measure argued that filling prisons with people who presented no . threat to society is expensive and is often counter-productive in . rehabilitating them away from crime. 'This historic victory overturns the . long-held conventional wisdom that it's impossible to fix our most . extreme and unjust crime laws - and hopefully inspires future efforts,' said campaign spokesman Dan Newman. However, efforts to abolish the death penalty fell short with just 46 per cent of the vote. Public . opinion in the United States has been moving away from the death . penalty, with five states abolishing it during the past decade. Seventeen states and the District of Columbia do not allow the death . penalty. A federal judge . halted all California executions in 2006, saying a three-drug lethal . injection risked causing inmates too much pain and suffering before . death. Executions have not yet resumed. Despite the suspension of this deterrent, crime in California, like the rest of the nation, has continues to fall dramatically.","55.9 per cent voted for condoms' use in all porn films made in Los Angeles .

"It is a myth that World Cup winners leave it late. They show. They announce. They reveal. Not years in advance, maybe, but not as the last grain of sand drips from the hourglass either. Time is running out for Stuart Lancaster and his men. This, a chance to defeat the world champions in their final meeting before the 2015 World Cup, ended in defeat. South Africa, the next opponents, have not been beaten since 2006. Very soon Lancaster will have his last game against Australia before facing them at the World Cup group stage. Then it is the Six Nations and the final chance to leave a footprint on Wales, who are also World Cup opponents. This is urgent business. Stuart Lancaster looks on dejectedly after yet another England defeat to the All Blacks . Chris Robshaw cannot hide his disappointment, but England need to pick themselves up, and soon . VIDEO England 21-24 New Zealand highlights . The calendar lies. World Cup is not, as is frequently stated, a year away. Prior to the big kick-off, Lancaster has 80 minutes to prove his point to Australia, the same for Wales. Zero for the All Blacks now. If England were to meet Steve Hansen’s team at the World Cup, their most recent memories would include conceding a try in the 22nd phase of play, and losing a 10-minute spell 3-0 to 14 men. No outcome is guaranteed by historical precedent, but New Zealand would have the psychological advantage. Dominating and winning against England would feel familiar to them. World Cup winners often produce a calling card. The summer before England brought home the Webb Ellis Cup in 2003, they travelled to the Southern Hemisphere and played like it belonged in their hands. They beat New Zealand in Wellington and Australia in Melbourne – the first time an England team had won on Australian soil. They arrived as Grand Slam champions, too. New Zealand were similarly relentless going into the 2011 tournament. Even South Africa, winners from left field in 2007, had served notice of their potential. In 2003 England went to the southern hemisphere and beat the best in their own back yard to send a message . Sir Clive Woodward's side went on to win the World Cup having proved they could mix it with the best . They were the only team to beat the All Blacks in 2006, and won 24-15 at Twickenham. Their margin of victory over Uruguay in 2005, 134-3, was a world record. So Lancaster, despite another weekend of taking the positives, needs more than honour in defeat. The tightness of the score flattered the hosts. Yes, there were opportunities squandered, not least by a Mike Brown fumble, but only an inexplicably missed penalty by Beau Barrett stopped the All Blacks’ 14 winning their passage of play 6-0, and in the same period they were repelled no more than a yard from the posts. England could not escape from their 22 in that time, let alone capitalise on numerical superiority. The 2003 vintage went to Australia knowing that they were already considered the team to beat . After Saturday's struggle, England will have to improve to set down a marker for Australia and South Africa . It was this segment that brought back memories of what a World Cup winning team looks like. In 2003, pre-ennoblement Clive Woodward went south, against the better judgment of many, to prepare for the World Cup in Australia. It was pessimistically presumed England would get sorted out, probably Jonny Wilkinson too, and the entire episode would be a catastrophe. Woodward was adamant. He thought England had the best team in the world and wanted to prove this prior to the competition. He didn’t want a World Cup meeting with Australia to also have to double up as a first victory down there. And he was right. England beat New Zealand, beat Australia and Wilkinson remained intact. When they faced Australia in Sydney in the final roughly four months later it was not as underdogs, but as recent winners over course and distance. They played as a team who had already shown world champion potential. And that is what New Zealand demonstrated on Saturday. The three-point win with reduced numbers in horrid, wet conditions? That contained an echo of Woodward’s team in Wellington. England had gone down to 13 players. It should have been the end of them but they held on and Wilkinson kicked a penalty shortly before the cavalry arrived. Richie McCaw's side have shown, yet again, that they are the team to beat at next year's World Cup . It was one of the moments when all but the most one-eyed Kiwi caught a glimpse of the future. It was champion form, World Cup- winning form. England did not have to take the positives or hide behind management speak that night. Their boldest statement was the scoreline; its supporting logic etched on the field of play. That was the difference at Twickenham on Saturday. England were still in game management mode in the post-match press conference, New Zealand’s most eloquent sentences had long been delivered. Lancaster has considerable mitigation, not least that he was taking on the world champions with 11 players out injured. Aaron Cruden crosses over as England, despite their early dominance, couldn't maintain a lead . Mike Brown, whose fumble close to the line was a major turning point, is tackled by Aaron Smith . Yet only a minority of the missing would have started, and he might have rotten luck 11 months from now, too. New Zealand won the World Cup without Dan Carter, or his understudy, Colin Slade at fly-half, and the third choice, Aaron Cruden, came off through injury after 34 minutes in the final. The best teams find a way of overcoming adversity: world champions, certainly. We have been down this road before, and recently. It was only last summer that Roy Hodgson sent the best prepared England football team in World Cup history to Brazil, and came home having had his hubris well and truly exposed. England’s rugby camp is inclined to similar claims. Upgraded training headquarters, a new performance centre and Desso pitch, altitude training booked for next summer and sports scientists imported at significant expense. Naturally, somebody from the world of cycling is also involved – in this case Matt Parker, who helped Bradley Wiggins become the first British winner of the Tour de France. Jonny May's try was on of the positives to take from the game, but England now need to pick up some wins . What does this prove? That sport in England has money. It can throw giant investment at projects such as winning the 2015 Rugby World Cup, it can splurge on the best preparation and like any other vast corporate entity it knows how to make precisely the right statements to cover any failings or inefficiencies. So in defeat, England’s hierarchy spoke very well, of margins and positives and the many months between now and their date with destiny. Yet at some time in the coming months, England have to start playing like World Cup winners. They have to lay down markers, intimidate and disconcert, as future world champions do. What can be guaranteed? Nothing. Those 10 minutes in Wellington did not make Woodward a certain World Cup winner. But, from there, the rest of the world thought he might be: and that is half the battle won.","England will not play All Blacks again before World Cup .
Last memory of New Zealand will be this demoralising defeat at Twickenham .
Stuart Lancaster's side must improve against Australia and South Africa ."

"Inflammatory: Charles said climate change denies use 'intimidation' to get their point across . Climate change deniers are headless chickens, Prince Charles has claimed. In an inflammatory speech, the heir to the throne spoke out against ‘the barrage of sheer intimidation’ from what he described as powerful interest groups. Addressing young environmental entrepreneurs at Buckingham Palace, he said sceptics were turning accepted scientific wisdom on its head. He said: ‘It is baffling that in our modern world we have such blind trust in science and technology that we all accept what science tells us about everything – until, that is, it comes to climate science. All of a sudden, and with a barrage of sheer intimidation, we are told by powerful groups of deniers that the scientists are wrong and we must abandon all our faith in so much overwhelming scientific evidence. ‘So, thank goodness for our young entrepreneurs here, who have the far-sightedness and confidence in what they know is happening to ignore the headless chicken brigade and do something practical to help.’ Charles was announcing the winner of a sustainability prize designed to inspire young people to tackle environmental, social and health issues. He told his guests on Thursday: ‘As you may possibly have noticed from time to time, I have tended to make a habit of sticking my head above the parapet and generally getting it shot off for pointing out what has always been blindingly obvious to me. Warning: Prince Charles, pictured today visiting a church in Herefordshire, made the comments to a group of young entrepreneurs . Inspection: The Prince viewed an eighteenth-century building which has been restored after 12 years of work . ‘Perhaps it has been too . uncomfortable for those with vested interests to acknowledge, but we . have spent the best part of the past century enthusiastically testing . the world to utter destruction; not looking closely enough at the . long-term impact our actions will have.’ Charles . has long led the public charge against global warming – despite . repeated warnings about his ‘meddling’ in contentious global issues. His . ‘headless chickens’ jibe ranks among his strongest comments yet. Benny Peiser, of the climate-sceptic Global Warming Policy Foundation, described the attack as aggressive and contentious. ‘This . is not unusual or surprising as he has made these claims many times . over the years. But the irony is that in doing so he, Charles, is the . mirror image of the very climate change deniers he attacks,’ he said. Concerned: The Prince has shown his enthusiasm for the weather before, and can be seen here taking a turn at the weather forecast in Scotland . Committed: Prince Charles is a passionate about climate change issues - he is pictured here speaking at a UN climate conference in 2009 . ‘It . is not about being a climate change denier, as he says. It’s just that . people are becoming more sceptical about the extent of climate change. ‘He . talks about vested interests but he should be very careful his words . don’t backfire on him. The Crown Estate, for example, is making huge . profits from the very offshore wind-farms that have angered so many of . his future subjects. ‘And . for many people the issue of rising energy bills now is more important . than what may or may not happen 100 years down the line. I fear he is . ill advised to make such aggressive and contentious speeches. ‘One . of the reasons the Queen and the Royal Family are so loved is that they . steer clear of such issues. His aggressive words indicate a certain . insecurity and intransigence that will not go down well with the . public.’ Last autumn UN . scientists said they were ‘95 per cent’ certain that climate change is . man-made – but could still not explain why the world has barely got . hotter in the last 15 years. The . Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that global warming was . in ‘hiatus’, rising by just 0.05C per decade since 1998, down from . 0.12C.

"Sunbathers would not let a long winter stop them from hitting the beach in Minnesota even though the lake hasn't even melted yet. The banks of Lake Superior were speckled with barely-clothed sunbathers on Memorial Day just like the lake was sprinkled with mini-icebergs. Even though temperatures were in the 80s this weekend, that hasn't automatically melted the remaining ice. Not a normal dip in the lake: Melissa Ellis and Brigitta Keyler are 'native Duluthians' and regularly sunbathe on the banks of Lake Superior but even though it was warm enough to tan the mini icebergs remained .

"Not many university lessons can claim to be as exciting as the one that took place at UCL last night. In a 10-minute telescope workshop, undergraduates spotted one of the nearest supernovas to Earth to be seen in recent decades. The fluke discovery took the form of a bright light in Messier 82 (M82) - also known as the Cigar Galaxy -  about 12 million light years away. Students and staff at UCL¿s teaching observatory, the University of London Observatory, have spotted one of the closest supernova to Earth in recent decades. The supernova in M82 is shown in the bottom image next to the white markers . Positioned between the Big Dipper and the Little Dipper, the supernova can be spotted with anyone with binoculars in the Northern Hemisphere over the next few days. The find has been described as a ‘Holy Grail’ for scientists and could help them unlock secrets about dark matter and how galaxies form. ‘One minute we’re eating pizza then five minutes later we’ve helped to discover a supernova,’ said student Tom Wright. ‘I couldn’t believe it. It reminds me why I got interested in astronomy in the first place.’ News of the supernova spread swiftly thanks Twitter, with professional astronomers comparing observations to help themselves understand its significance . Messier 82 (also known as NGC 3034, Cigar Galaxy or M82) is the  nearby starburst galaxy about 12 million light-years away in the constellation Ursa Major.This composite image of the nearby M82 shows Chandra X-ray Observatory data of starbursts in blue . A supernova happens where there is a change in the core, or centre, of a star. A change can occur in two different ways. The first type of supernova happens in binary star systems. Binary stars are two stars that orbit the same point. One of the stars, a carbon-oxygen white dwarf, steals matter from its companion star. Eventually, the white dwarf accumulates too much matter. Having too much matter causes the star to explode. The second type of supernova occurs at the end of a single star’s lifetime. As the star runs out of nuclear fuel, some of its mass flows into its core. Eventually, the core is so heavy that it cannot withstand its own gravitational force. The core collapses, which results in the giant explosion of a supernova. At 7.20PM last night Dr Steve Fossey, who was leading the workshop, spotted the exploding star in M82. ‘The weather was closing in, with increasing cloud,’ Dr Fossey said, ‘So instead of the planned practical astronomy class, I gave the students an introductory demonstration of how to use the CCD camera on one of the observatory’s automated 0.35–metre telescopes.’ The students chose M82, a bright and photogenic galaxy as their target, as it was in one of the shrinking patches of clear sky. While adjusting the telescope’s position, Dr Fossey noticed a ‘star’ overlaid on the galaxy which he did not recognise from previous observations. The group inspected online archive images of the galaxy, and it became apparent that there was indeed a new star-like object in M82. With clouds closing in, time was running out, so the team switched to taking a rapid series of one and two minute exposures through different coloured filters. This helped them check that the object persisted, and they were able to measure its brightness and colour. News of the supernova spread swiftly thanks Twitter, with professional astronomers comparing observations to help themselves understand its significance. One of UCL's two 0.35-metre Celestron C14 telescopes. These were used to find the supernova in M82 . Meanwhile, the team at UCL started up a second telescope to obtain a second source of data. By about 7:40 PM GMT, the cloud cover was almost complete, but it was just possible to make out the new object in the second data set. The supernova is one of the nearest to be observed in recent decades. The closest by far since the invention of the telescope was Supernova 1987A in February 1987, located at a distance of 168 000 light years. This discovery is more distant at around 12 million light years, about the same as the 1993 discovery of a supernova in nearby Messier 81. ‘The chances of finding anything new in the sky is astronomical but this was particularly astounding as it was one of the first images we had taken on this telescope,’ said student Ben Cooke. ‘My career plan had been to continue my studies in astrophysics. Its going to be hard to ever top this though.'","Supernova was found last night in a galaxy 12 million light years away .

"A beaming Prince Harry gave his royal approval to the Australian women's hockey side today after they trounced England in a 3-0 victory at the Commonwealth games. The royal seemed thrilled to be introduced to the triumphant athletes at the Glasgow National Hockey centre, and posed for photographs with the Aussie team, nicknamed the Hockeyroos. Despite England's loss, Harry, 29, seemed in a jovial mood and smiled as he mingled with the players, who are favourites to win gold in the games, having taken the top spot in Delhi in 2010 and Melbourne in 2006. Royal welcome: Members of the Australian hockey team - or the Hockeyroos - smile as Harry seems to crack a joke after their victory in Glasgow . Posed up: Members of the team, which beat England 3-0 today and are favourites to take home a gold medal for their performance . After shaking hands with the winning players, Harry went on to pose for photographs with his arms around them. The Prince, presumably in a gracious mood, also commiserated with the England team. Jodie Kenny and Emily Smith, who between them scored their teams' goals, looked particularly thrilled in the aftermath of their victory. The team took the royal visit as further proof of their world domination, later tweeting: 'Prince Harry is on board the #roovolution as meets @Anna_Flanagan and the girls after today's win over England' Giving some tips?

Happy days: The two princes smiled in the sunshine today as they shook hands and posed with players from both teams . The game means Australia is safely through to the last four, securing the top place finish in Pool B with four wins from four and a goal record of 25 scored and 0 conceded. England began brightly as birthday girl Susannah Townsend found Ellie Watton and tried to attack the goal, but were blocked by Australian keeper Rachael Lynch. Two quick scores, however, had England on the back foot as first Kenny converted from a penalty corner on 17 minutes, before Smith capitalised on a mistake from captain Kate Richardson-Walsh shortly afterwards. Maddie Hinch in the England goal was forced to save two shots from Kenny before the break, while Lily Owsley fired a shot just wide of the mark. A green card for Laura Unsworth proved costly 13 minutes into the second half as shortly after she left the field, Kenny slotted home from another short corner. England kept pressing and earned two penalty corners of their own but on both occasions they couldn’t find the target – Sam Quek seeing an effort deflected behind. Georgie Twigg also made her return for England after missing their last game against Malaysia through the injury she sustained in the opening game. After the match, England coach Danny Kerry said: 'Australia were better than us defensively and offensively in both circles but I actually felt for large periods of the game we were playing the more constructive hockey. 'The reality is that we need to be much tougher in both circles and their corner execution was superior to ours today.' Group shot!

During the four-hour hazmat training, a team of two can train as many as 50 soldiers, the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) told The Daily Beast. 'All training is tiered to the level of risk each person may encounter,' said Caree Vander Linden, spokesman for USAMRIID, which is based out of Fort Detrick. So far, there are 547 U.S. troops in West Africa, serving in Senegal and Liberia, where they have reportedly been holing up in improvised quarters in hotels and local government facilities. This is while the military builds a 25-bed hospital, 'life support areas' and 17 treatment centers in Liberia, where they can train local professionals to care for and conduct tests on potential victims. Safety measures: The soldiers are also not permitted to shake hands, must frequently wash their hands with a chlorine solution and are required to have their temperatures measured (pictured) several times a day . Outbreak: It comes as the Ebola death toll has struck 4,546, bringing the total number of confirmed and suspected cases of the virus to 9,191. Above, a health worker carries a baby to an Ebola holding center . In protective gear: Symptoms of the deadly virus include a high fever, vomiting and joint and muscle aches . According to USA Today, the four-hour training process can be daunting for soldiers, with some being told that Ebola 'basically causes your body to eat itself from the inside out'. Others have reportedly been warned that the disease is 'worse' that what they might have encountered in Afghanistan, while several have been told the virus is 'catastrophic... with a high fatality rate'. 'I’ll be honest with you,' one soldier told the newspaper. 'I’m kind of scared.' Despite the trainers' apparent shock tactics, the Army maintains that the risk of soldiers contracting the virus is minimal because it is not airborne and they will not have contact with sick patients.

Since the Ebola outbreak, most cases of the virus have been recorded in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. Symptoms of the virus include a high fever, vomiting, a headache and joint aches. These appear two to 21 days after exposure to the disease, the CDC said.","Soldiers are 'given four hours of Ebola training before they are deployed'

"An Adelie penguin walking on the ice in Antarctica. Climate change is killing worrying amounts of birds . Penguins are in peril because of extreme environmental conditions linked to climate change, research has shown. A pair of new studies highlight the plight of penguin colonies trying to cope with the effects of global warming in Argentina and Antarctica. At both locations, the beguiling birds face an uncertain future. Climate change is killing chicks from the world’s biggest colony of Magellanic penguins at Punta Tombo, Argentina, by increasing the rate of drenching rainstorms and heatwaves, say scientists. Meanwhile Adelie penguins on Ross Island, Antarctica, are finding it harder to feed as melting sea ice fragments form giant icebergs. Protected only by a downy coat, the Magellanic chicks can be left to struggle and die when rainstorms hit their colony. At other times, faced with extreme heat, their lack of waterproofing means they cannot cool off by taking a dip. Dr Ginger Rebstock, from the University of Washington, took part in a 27 year-long study of the 400,000-strong Argentinian colony. He said: 'We’re going to see years where almost no chicks survive if climate change makes storms bigger and more frequent during vulnerable times of the breeding season, as climatologists predict.' During the course of the study, an average 65 per cent of chicks died each year, with some 40 per cent starving. Climate change was blamed for an average 7 per cent of chick deaths, but in some years was the most common cause of death. Magellanic penguins on Saunders Island in the Falkland Islands. Climate change was blamed for an average 7 per cent of chick deaths, but in some years was the most common cause of death . In one year, 43 per cent of all chick deaths were attributed to climate change and in another 50 per cent. Starvation and the weather were likely to interact increasingly as the climate changed, according to the researchers. 65 per cent of chicks died each year, with 40 per cent starving. Climate change was blamed for an average seven per cent of chick deaths, but in some years was the most common cause of death. In one year, 43 per cent of all chick deaths were attributed to climate change and in another 50 per cent. 'Starving chicks are more likely to die in a storm,' said Professor Dee Boersma, also from the University of Washington, who led the study. At Ross Island, scientists spent 13 years collecting data on the foraging ability of chick-rearing Adelie penguins, which are dependent on year-round sea ice. They found that under 'normal' conditions they were able to cope with changes in sea ice concentrations. But the appearance of giant icebergs reduced their chances of catching fish prey. How well they would be able to survive if such conditions became more common was unknown. 'If the frequency of such extreme events increases, then it will become very hard to predict how penguin populations will buffer future sea ice changes,' said lead researcher Dr Amelie Lescroel, from the Centre d’Ecologie Fontionnelle et Evolutive in France. Both studies appear in the latest edition of the online journal Public Library of Science ONE.","Birds in Argentina and Antarctica are dying from shifts in weather .

"The murder of Christopher Stevens, pictured, who died alongside three other US embassy officials, cannot be written off as an isolated incident . The murder of Christopher Stevens is as shocking as it is unprecedented in recent times. The last assassination of an American ambassador was in Afghanistan, more than three decades ago. However, the killing of Mr Stevens, who died alongside three other US embassy officials, cannot be written off as an isolated incident. Rather, it marks an opening salvo by radical groups in Libya who are now poised, with deadly determination, to launch a post-Arab Spring wave of revolution in the name of Islamic fundamentalism. Similar groups across the Middle East will follow their lead. It is no coincidence the attack took place on the anniversary of September 11, for these groups are fiercely hostile to America and the West. From Tunisia to Yemen, Egypt to Syria, the emergent extremists have one clear goal: the toppling of the nascent regimes that came to power after last year’s uprisings. Their wish is to impose the strictest form of Islam on society, and espouse hostile views against what they see as the decadent West. Such groups believe the new regimes are led by pro-Western stooges or secular elites. And it is not just America these extremists loathe. While the relatively moderate Muslim Brotherhood which swept to power in Egypt wishes to maintain a long-standing peace treaty with Israel, these Al Qaeda-inspired terror groups dream of wiping the Jewish state off the map. So this week’s US deaths are the latest power play in a region-wide struggle – one in which Britain involved itself this week when it sent the head of MI6 to encourage the Israelis not to attack Iran. Blame for the attack on the American consulate has been laid at the door of an ultra-conservative Islamist group, Ansar al-Shariah (Supporters of Shariah). It isn’t their first violent foray. The group have also been responsible for imposing the segregation of the sexes in public, setting up torture chambers and beating up anyone caught with alcohol. In June, a vehicle containing the British ambassador to Libya was attacked by rocket-propelled grenades, and the US Consulate in Tripoli was also bombed. The group says the attacks were motivated by assassinations of suspected Al Qaeda members in Pakistan by unmanned US drones. Self-evidently, nearly a year after the fall of Gaddafi, Libya is anything but stable. Scroll down for video . Flames of hate: A gunman celebrates  at the US compound in Benghazi after the embassy was attacked by a mob . The ruling National Transitional Council, largely made up of secularist newcomers and former regime hangers-on, is staunchly pro-West, and was quick to distance itself from the attack on the embassy. But it rules only in name. Libya’s still lawless streets have been overrun by a hodge-podge of Islamist and tribal militias. They refuse to recognise the NTC’s authority, and have assassinated numerous Libyan government officials during recent months. Spark for the attack on the US consulate, though, was not disaffection with the government, but the release online of clips from the film Innocence of Muslims which attacks the Prophet Mohammed as a paedohile and philanderer. Offensive, insulting and childish, it may have been intended to help Israel by exposing the threat of Islam. But it is only serving to threaten Israel’s immediate security. The nation’s position in the Middle East is precarious, and the Arab Spring has presented the country with a number of new challenges because it’s security is closely tied to that of Libya and Syria. The American flag stood at half-staff at the U.S. Capitol yesterday in respect of Stevens and three other officials who were murdered . Damage: The wreckage at the US consulate, one day after armed men stormed the place . Syria has long provided a conduit for Iran to provide aid and weapons to its proxy Hezbollah in Lebanon, and has offered a safe haven for the Hamas leadership. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are Iran-backed enemies of Israel. If the Assad regime in Syria does fall, many in the West imagine that Iran will be left isolated and vulnerable, and Israel’s established enemies therefore weakened. However, quite the reverse may happen. There is every chance that the Assad regime would be replaced (as in Libya) by a Western-backed interim government of ‘moderate’ Islamist groups and former regime defectors. Such a government wouldn’t last long. Foreign jihadists have been flooding into the country. Once Assad is overthrown, they will jump at the chance to seize power and turn their firepower on Israel. Israel may then find itself confronting an even more determined, uncontrollable and fanatical enemy than any of the pre-Arab Spring regimes ever proved to be. The attack on the US consulate in Benghazi offers a chilling sign of what lies ahead, not just in Libya, but across the region. Burnt: The attack of the compound, pictured, took place on September 11, the anniversary of the Twin Towers . Glass, debris and overturned furniture are strewn inside a room in the gutted U.S. consulate . So what can we conclude from these troubling developments? Primarily, that the West has learned nothing from its experience in Afghanistan and Iraq. In Libya and Syria, Western governments have backed radical Islamist groups, and by doing so have failed to understand that loyalty bought rather than earned is a recipe for disaster. For while the Islamists are initially eager to take arms and funding from the West, they prove still more eager to turn and use those weapons against their former paymasters . And while the Sunni jihadists in Libya and Syria are no friends of Shia-dominated Iran, their long-term desire to see the destruction of Israel and its American allies transcends such regional rivalries. Attacks by Islamists last month along Israel’s border with Egypt, the most brazen in decades, show that the danger posed by jihadists is not an intangible fear but a current – and growing – problem. The storming of the American consulate in Libya, moreover, coincided with a similar storming of the U.S. embassy in Cairo. Chris Stevens, right, attends meetings in Benghazi, Libya last year . This shows yet again that, while the Muslim Brotherhood-led Egyptian government may be pro-West, the Egyptian masses are not. They remain as anti-Israel as ever. An Israeli attack on Iran, or a US bombing of the country at Israel’s behest, will galvanise the Arab world as never before. It will provide the perfect opportunity for radicals to launch a counter-revolution against ‘moderate’ regimes. It has been said time and time again that the first wave of Arab Spring revolutions were started by the self-immolation of a Tunisian street seller. Could Sam Bacile’s ill-conceived film about the prophet Mohammed similarly prove the catalyst that brings the most formidable enemies of Israel and the West to power? John R.

"Anniversary visit: Prince Charles shares a joke on a visit to Pimlico Academy to mark ten years of the Prince's Teaching Institute . Infamous for 'losing' America and going mad during his reign, George III has hardly gone down in the annals of history as the finest monarch ever to grace the throne. But Prince Charles, the man who is of course next in line to the crown, told school pupils that the King who reigned in the 18th and early 19th century is the monarch he most respects. The Prince of Wales was grilled by 14-year-old pupils Marilyn Goncalves and Joshua Ashworth on a visit to Pimlico Academy, London, today. The pair were asked to help lead Charles on a tour of the school to celebrate the 10th birthday of the Prince's Teaching Institute (PTI), and took the opportunity to quiz the Prince as they entered a history lesson. After the tour, Marilyn said: 'We asked him the question: ""Which monarch do you most respect?"" And he said George III, because he thought he was a really good man. 'People thought he was mad, but really [Charles] said that the people misunderstood and that he just had an illness. 'He thought that he was a really good king.' Joshua added: 'He said he also believes that his mother was really important in stabilising Britain throughout many years.' George III reigned from 1760 to 1820 and is accused by some quarters of failing to properly protect Britain's interests. He is described by the British Monarchy's official website as 'widely remembered for two things: losing the American colonies and going mad'. But Professor Stephen Conway, an expert in 18th-century British history who teaches at University College London, said that Charles's choice may reflect a fairer image of George III. Grilled: When quizzed by pupils, Prince Charles said that the monarch he most respects is George III . Musical: Charles listened to students play several songs on the steel drums and then appeared delighted to have a go himself . He said: 'I think perhaps what Prince Charles wanted to emphasise was more the fact that George III, in the aftermath of the loss of the American colonies, became a symbol of the nation, national resilience and the determination to bounce back.' Tour: The Prince of Wales was shown around the school by two 14-year-old pupils . Charles visited the academy to mark the 10th anniversary of the PTI, which aims to bring together and inspire teachers from secondary state schools. Past speakers at PTI events have included Sir Tom Stoppard, Simon Schama, Michael Palin, Jools Holland and Stephen Fry. The Prince met teachers who attended PTI and also those on the Teach First scheme which encourages top graduates to enter state school teaching. He has been Patron of Teach First since June 2008. The Prince also listened to the school's steel drum band play Vibes Cyah Done by Machel Montano and Do I Do by Stevie Wonder, to which he could be seen tapping his feet and nodding his head. He later got a chance to play the steel drum himself as he hit some chords under the guidance of one of the pupils. Before Charles left the school his two young tour guides got to congratulate him on the news that he is to become a grandfather. Marilyn said: 'He said that it makes him feel a bit older now.' Laughs: The Prince laughs while attempting to play the steel drums with Pimlico Academy pupil Kari-Ann Desilva . Nigel Hawthorne as King George III in the 1994 film The Madness of King George . George III reigned from 1760 to his death in 1820 - one of the longest reigns by any British monarch in history. He is most remembered as the king who lost the American colonies and went mad and was famoulsy depicted in Nicholas Hytner's 1994 The Madness of King George. The eldest son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, George succeeded his grandfather George II at the age of 22, becoming the third Hanoverian monach to reign. He was the first Hanoverian to have been born in England and the first to speak English as his first language. According to the Monarchy's official website, George's direct responsibility for the loss of the colonies is not great. He opposed their bid for independence to the end, but he did not develop the policies (such as the Stamp Act of 1765 and the Townshend duties of 1767 on tea, paper and other products) which led to war in 1775-76 and which had the support of Parliament. These policies were largely due to the financial burdens of garrisoning and administering the vast expansion of territory brought under the British Crown in America, the costs of a series of wars with France and Spain in North America, and the loans given to the East India Company (then responsible for administering India). By the 1770s, and at a time when there was no income tax, the national debt required an annual revenue of £4 million to service it. The declaration of American independence on 4 July 1776, the end of the war with the surrender by British forces in 1782, and the defeat which the loss of the American colonies represented, could have threatened the Hanoverian throne. However, George's strong defence of what he saw as the national interest and the prospect of long war with revolutionary France made him, if anything, more popular than before. The American war, its political aftermath and family anxieties placed great strain on George in the 1780s. After serious bouts of illness in 1788-89 and again in 1801, George became permanently deranged in 1810. He was mentally unfit to rule in the last decade of his reign; his eldest son - the later George IV - acted as Prince Regent from 1811. Some medical historians have said that George III's mental instability was caused by a hereditary physical disorder called porphyria.

"Tommy the chimpanzee may soon become a human, at least in the eyes of the law. A rights group sued Tommy's owners today, in an attempt to free the 26-year-old primate so that he can live at a sanctuary. The lawsuit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project, is petitioning a New York court to grant Tommy 'legal personhood' based on scientific evidence that chimpanzees have the mental capacity to make decisions for themselves. Against his will: A nonhuman rights group sued a couple in New York for illegally detaining their chimpanzee named Tommy (who is not pictured above) in a cage on their trailer park and lost the case . The group will also bring up precedents which granted freedom to slaves before they were emancipated and considered real people. 'Not long ago, people generally agreed that human slaves could not be legal persons, but were simple the property of their owners,' the non-profit's president Steven Wise told USA Today. 'We will assert, based on clear scientific evidence, that it's time to take the next step and recognize that these non-human animals cannot continue to be exploited as the property of their human owners.' The lawsuit also argues that New York state 'does not limit legal personhood to homo sapiens'. The group plans on bringing up two similar lawsuits to free three other New York state chimps. Wise and his group say that Tommy is being held against his will in a 'small, dank, cement cage' at his owner's reindeer farm in Gloversville, New York and if given the choice, this is not how he would chose to live. But his owners say that's just not the case. Tommy is one of 11 chimps that Patrick Lavery and his wife Diane have taken in from abusive or neglectful homes. They keep the chimps at their farm temporarily so that they can find a suitable sanctuary. Remaining with their owners: Three lawsuits in New York have kept chimpanzees (similar to those above) in the care of their owners even though an animal rights group wanted to have them placed in a sanctuary . The Lavery's have had Tommy for a decade and are still looking for a sanctuary close enough to their other home in Ocala, Florida so that they can visit him. 'He's actually my favorite. He's so attached ot us when we get home, he'll be so excited to see us,' Mr Lavery said from Florida. He says that Tommy is kept in a cage that exceeds state and federal standards and is inspected yearly. Its' not 'small' or 'dank; but a large area that has a door to an outside play area. During the winter, Tommy stays inside in a building heated to 70 degrees, with the walls of his quarters painted to look like a jungle. 'The chimp has a color TV and cable,' Mr Lavery said., 'He watches cartoons.' And Mr Lavery is no rookie when it comes to chimp-keeping. 'Ive got 20 years experience with chimpanzees. We're not just some Joe Blow on the street who just happens to have a chimpanzee. I've had animals all my life. Horses, dogs, reindeer. It's not a fly-by-night operations.'","The Nonhuman Rights Project says that Tommy the chimpanzee is being detained against his will in Gloversville, New York .

"Mohamed has been revealed as the most popular baby name in Israel – despite authorities trying to keep it hidden from the annual official list. The Population and Immigration Authority has this week published a list of the 10 most popular boys and girls names of those born in Israel this year. However, it has omitted  Arabic baby names from the list, including Mohamed which should have topped the boys' list and Ahmed which should have placed ninth. The Population and Immigration Authority has published a list of the 10 most popular boys and girls names of those born in Israel this year but has failed to include Arabic names including the top choice of Mohamed . Instead, the authority claims that the most commonly used Israeli boys' names over the last 12 months were: Yosef, Daniel, Uri, Itai, Omer, Adam, Noam, Ariel, Eitan, David. Nowhere in its statement, which was released ahead of the Jewish New Year, did it note the fact that Arabic baby names had been withheld. It lists the most popular girls' name as Tamar, which pushes Noa into second place after spending 14 years in the top spot. Other popular girls' names include: Shira, Adele, Talya, Yael, Lian, Miriam, Maya and Avigayil. Lian, Miriam (Maryam) and Maya are used by both Jews and Arabs. However, the authority has come under fire after being accused by Israeli news service Haaretz of omitting Arabic names from the official list of boys' names. The news service said several Arab names were statistically more popular than the ones on the official list - including Mohamed. The Population and Immigration Authority said its list reflected the media's interest in popular Hebrew names .

"FIFA's chief ethics investigator Michael Garcia has criticised the culture of secrecy at the world governing body and called for greater transparency. Garcia, who has been investigating the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, said he had been operating under conditions more suitable for 'an intelligence agency'. He called on the people running FIFA to show leadership and publish the 430-page report - FIFA president Sepp Blatter has said that to do so would threaten witness confidentiality. Sepp Blatter rejected calls to publish Michael Garcia's investigations into the World Cup bidding process . Garcia, speaking at an event in London, said: 'The investigation and adjudication process operates in most parts unseen and unheard. 'That's a kind of system which might be appropriate for an intelligence agency but not for an ethics compliance process in an international sports institution that serves the public and is the subject of intense public scrutiny.' Chief investigator Garcia has likened FIFA's culture of secrecy to that of an intelligence agency .

"Adel Taarabt insisted he is fit enough for the rigours of the Barclays Premier League yet Harry Redknapp claimed he is overweight. But one thing's for sure: the controversial midfielder is in better shape than the QPR chairman. Tony Fernandes appeared to make light of the row between his club's manager and playmaker by sharing a self-deprecating picture of his naked torso with the message: 'Getting ready for Villa.' 'Getting ready for Villa'! Tony Fernandes shared this naked selfie with his Instagram followers . The Air Asia boss is clearly carrying some extra baggage but Fernandes should be applauded for enjoying a laugh at himself during a tough time for his club. QPR are rock bottom of the Barclays Premier League with just one win from eight games heading into Monday night's clash against Villa at Loftus Road. The 3-2 home defeat by Liverpool last Sunday was made all the more miserable by conceding two shambolic own goals during that match and then the following fallout between Redknapp and Taarabt. Adel Taarabt attempted to prove his fitness by showing off his flat stomach to Sportrsmail . Harry Redknapp accused the Moroccan playmaker of being 'three stone overweight' The 67-year-old manager accused his playmaker of being 'three stone overweight', while Taarabt posed for pictures taken by Sportsmail's Andy Hooper showing his flat stomach in an attempt to prove his fitness. Fernandes called for an end to the row last week, saying: 'Professional players must be fit. If I do a job I'm ready to do the job. Full stop. The bucks stops at you. It's your body and your career.' Redknapp now insists that the fuss is over and over the course of a week Fernandes's attitude appears to have mellowed to the point where he can laugh at the issue. Redknapp faces a tough job in turning QPR's season around amid an injury crisis . Fernandes also resisted some calls for Redknapp to be replaced as QPR boss by saying on Sunday: 'Let's (get) all our players off the injury list... and then judge Harry.' Rangers currently have seven players on the treatment table: Niko Kranjcar (illness), Rio Ferdinand (groin), Sandro (groin), Nedum Onuoha (hamstring), Jordon Mutch (hamstring), Joey Barton (hamstring) and Alejandro Faurlin (ACL). Fernandes also added on his own future: 'When QPR fans want me to go due to my poor decision making I will go. Full stop.'","Tony Fernandes posts picture to make light of Adal Taarabt fitness feud .

"The body of a British woman who went missing while travelling on a yacht off the coast of Mexico has been found, according to state prosecutors. The Foreign Office confirmed one Briton had died after a search operation was launched earlier this week for couple Paul Whitehouse and Simone Wood in the aftermath of Hurricane Odile. The pair, from London and Wolverhampton, are thought to have been living on their yacht in La Paz for a year. Mr Whitehouse is still missing, it has been reported this morning. The body of Simone Wood (pictured left) has been found after she and partner Paul Whitehouse (right) went missing during hurricane Odile . A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: 'We can confirm the death of a British national, reported missing along with another British national earlier this week off the coast of Mexico. 'The Embassy is working with the local authorities and consular staff are providing assistance to both families at this very difficult time.' Hurricane Odile left a trail of destruction when it hit the Baja California Peninsula last Sunday. Three other people have been confirmed dead following the storm - two Korean citizens and a German man who reportedly died from a heart attack. Mexican authorities have deployed more than 8,000 army, navy and federal police personnel to prevent looting in the area. Simon Barlow, a friend of Mr Whitehouse, said those close to him are 'massively worried, really concerned with the situation over in Mexico'. Mr Whitehouse (pictured left and right), from London and Wolverhampton, are thought to have been living on their yacht in La Paz for a year . Mr Barlow told Channel 4 News yesterday: 'We are all hoping that they are going to be found and it's just communications that's not letting us find that information out. 'We're waiting and anticipating, you just can't put it into words, you just can't go over there to help. 'I'm hoping that his background of being in the Army has hopefully served a purpose and they're both fine.' The couple, in their 40s, were believed to be living on their yacht in the harbour of La Paz when it capsized along with 24 other vessels during violent 125mph winds. It is thought that the pair had been living on the 70-foot boat for the last year as Mr Whitehouse worked as a scuba diving instructor in La Paz. The category three hurricane destroyed homes and hotels in beach resorts across the Baja California peninsula while also damaging power and water supplies and phone services - triggering widespread looting.

"Tottenham winger Nacer Chadli has got his kit off for Cosmopolitan magazine to raise awareness of male cancer for Cancer Research UK. Chadli, posing with nothing but a towel, has gone some way to proving he's in good shape both on and off the pitch, as he shows of his rippling physique which the Belgian claims he is 'pretty happy with'. The 26-year-old has been one of Mauricio Pochettino's star players so far this season, scoring five Premier League goals with the latest coming in Tottenham's late comeback against Aston Villa on Sunday. Nacer Chadli has posed naked for Cosmopolitan to raise awareness of male cancer for Cancer Research UK . The Belgian winger celebrates scoring for Tottenham against Aston Villa on Sunday . Chadli scored his fifth Premier League goal of the season at Villa Park as Spurs won 2-1 . Spurs were 1-0 down with just over five minutes remaining at Villa Park before Chadli low finish sparked the Tottenham revival which saw Harry Kane grab a late winner for the north London club. Speaking to Cosmopolitan, Chadli claimed he hopes his naked snap will get people talking about an important cause. He said: 'As a footballer, my body’s my tool – so I have to take care of it, and I’m pretty happy with the way I look and what my body is capable of – sometimes I’d like more muscle or bigger legs, but you can never be perfect. My weakness is definitely chocolate – Belgian obviously. 'I’ve never posed naked before, but I’m not nervous – maybe I should wait and see what the reaction’s like! 'It’s an important cause – cancer affects lots of families, so I hope it gets people talking.' On the pitch, Chadli has backed Kane for a senior England call-up despite admitting he had never heard of the young striker before joining Tottenham. The 26-year-old revealed his weakness was Belgian chocolate, but he his happy with his body . Kane's free-kick winner at Villa on Sunday was his seventh goal in his last seven games and eighth of the season. He has nine England Under-21 caps and six goals after helping Gareth Southgate's side to Euro 2015 last month. Roy Hodgson's senior side host Slovenia in a Euro 2016 qualifier before a friendly in Scotland in two weeks and Chadli believes his team-mate deserves a call-up. Harry Kane wheels away in celebration of his late winner against Paul Lambert's side . He said: 'Why not? It is up to him and the manager of the national team. He has a lot of quality and he can have some impact in the game. 'He practises a lot of free kicks like that in training. He has a great shot and he still practises it. That is good, he is a young talented player. I am very happy for him and pleased for him that he made an impact.'

"A man accidentally shot a woman while hunting deer in the woods of LaFayette, Georgia. Now the pair are officially in love. Friends Aubrey Mayo, 24, and Matthew Tyler Webb, 23, were spending time together on the roof of Webb's mothers home at 910 Hillsdale road on November 21 when Webb saw a pack of deer across the street and decided to hunt them down. He left at around 5:30 pm. The Times Free Press reports that Mayo stayed behind but later went to find Webb after she thought she heard him calling her name. Mayo made her way down the ladder and across the street to where Webb was hunting. Audrey (left) fell for Matthew(right) after he accidentally shot her in leg during an impromptu hunting trip . 'I was doing like a half yell,' Mayo said because she didn't want to scare away the deer. Webb didn't hear Mayo calling his name. He simply heard rustling and saw a bit of movement behind the trees. He shot. She fell down. Mayo doesn't remember much other than hearing a gun shot wound and feeling herself fall to the ground. Webb heard his friend screaming so he rushed after her and wrapped up her wound with his jacket. 'There were massive amounts of blood,' said LaFayette Police Department Capt. Stacey Meeks to reporters. Mayo remebers a sharp pain and lying on the ground. She remembers hearing medics talking but couldn't understand anything they were saying. Webb hunted  his dear girlfriend with an SKS hunting rifle similar to the one pictured here . When Mayo woke up days later at Erlanger hospital, Webb was in the room holding onto a note he had written so that he could properly communicate what he wanted to say to the woman he loved, but almost fatally injured. The pair knew each other for two months prior to the incident but the relationship was casual--of course until he shot her in the leg. 'Cupid doesn't use a bow and arrow anymore,' said 30-year-old Jesse Greer, Mayo's brother-in-law. 'He uses an SKS' rifle. Mayo couldn't have been too mad because the couple officially started dating on November 21. after she was shot. Even though there was no bad blood between Mayo and Webb, Webb got in some legal trouble following the incident. Webb was arrested for firing a gun within 150 feet of road. Webb will also face hunting violations as the Georgia Department of Natural Resources is conducting an investigation. Hunting regulations would have required Mayo and Webb to be wearing bright orange to avoid being mistaken for an animal such as in this case. He could be charged with failing to wear orange, a hunting license violation, and misuse of a firearm. Webb also confessed to taking several drugs on the day of the incident. Despite the fact that Mayo's leg suffered significant nerve damage and she may have to have it amputated if it becomes infected, her family is not mad at Webb because he didn't mean to shoot her. Audrey may have to have her leg amputated if it becomes infected . Audrey has a sense of humor about the event even though she is in great pain . Her pain is so unbearable that Mayo is on nine different medications. She sometimes feels pain when she blinks. 'It hurts on top of my knee,' she said. 'And behind my knee. And on my shin, my calf, my ankle, my hip. The whole thing hurts.' Although, Mayo and her family are happy that she is alive. Audrey's mother Mary Mayo, 59, a Memorial Hospital nurse, thought that her daughter would be dead or brain damaged for the rest of her life. Audrey seems to have a sense of humor about the incident. She told reporters that she wants to make a necklace with the bullet that shot her. Audrey's brother suggested that his sister get a tattoo of a deer with her hospital name 'Jane Doe' across it. 'Once we realized she was alive -- and that she was going to be alive -- we started to lighten up a little bit,' her sister Rachel Greer told the Times Free Press. 'It's like a modern version of how a caveman used to bash a woman over the head with a club,' Greer said. 'These days, they just shoot her in the leg,' said Rachel. Audrey is maintaining a positive outlook and said, 'no need to put negativity on the whole thing.' The couple are happily in love and are both avid Grateful Dead fans. They are also grateful that Audrey is alive.","Aubrey Mayo and Matthew Webb were friends before the accident but it wasn't till after he shot her that they started dating .

"Read Matt Barlow's match report from the Liberty Stadium here . It's 'same old Arsenal' after another under-par defensive display in the 2-1 defeat at Swansea on Sunday, according to Jamie Carragher. The former Liverpool defender was scathing in his analysis of Arsene Wenger's tactics, even referencing his summer business in the transfer market as a reason why the club are struggling. Arsenal threw away a goal lead with 16 minutes remaining at the Liberty, with the Welsh side scoring through Gylfi Sigurdsson and Bafetimbi Gomis. Arsene Wenger (centre) looks dejected as Swansea take a 2-1 lead at the Liberty Stadium . Sanchez (left) can't hide his dismay after Swansea's second goal and it meant Arsenal lost another lead . Carragher, speaking on Sky Sports 1, said: 'I've said it a million times in the last 12 months, same things, nothing new. 'Before the game Wenger was laughing, I don't think he'll be laughing now. He said he's getting the balance right between attacking and defending. 'For the equaliser he's got seven or eight players ahead of the ball with 15 minutes to go. 'How do you get counter-attacked when you're 1-0 up with 15 minutes to go? 'The one opportunity when Swansea put quality in the box, [Nacho] Monreal was beaten, as we all knew he would be.' Calum Chambers (left) struggled to cope with Jefferson Montero's pace ahead of Swansea's winner . With Arsenal 1-0 up, eight players were ahead of the ball as Swansea moved forward with the ball . Carragher believes Wenger's failures in autumn have stemmed from a poor transfer window and not addressing the issues from last season. With Chelsea now 12 points ahead of Wenger's side, Carragher claims the club have gone backwards, and the Frenchman should have taken a leaf out of Jose Mourinho's book. He added: 'Chelsea and Arsenal seem miles apart - and that's just because Mourinho identified what he needed. His team now look unstoppable as a result. 'They let (Thomas) Vermaelen go and they didn't replace him, these small details always cost Arsenal at the top. Jamie Carragher believes Arsenal failed to replace Thomas Vermaelen in the summer . Bafetimbi Gomis wheels away after heading in the winner in Swansea's 2-1 victory over Arsenal . 'This stage last year they were top of the league with a healthy lead. The problem for Arsenal, and any team, is that you want to feel like you're making progress. 'They won the FA Cup. The next level, having won a trophy, they should make two or three big signings. 'But with Arsenal you never feel they're going to make those big signings to take you there.' Arsenal finished three points behind Chelsea but won the FA Cup last season. Mourinho bought Cesc Fabregas, Diego Costa, Filipe Luis, Didier Drogba and Loic Remy, while letting go of unwanted players for hefty sums. Chelsea had a healthy summer, signing Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Filipe Luis, among others . Gylfi Sigurdsson brought the Swans back into the game with a beautiful free kick . Wenger brought in Alexis Sanchez, Danny Welbeck, Calum Chambers and Mathieu Debuchy, but Carragher feels it wasn't enough. 'They had a better season than Chelsea, but now they feel miles apart,' he said. 'Mourinho saw areas they needed to improve and signed in those areas. Even from last season [Arsenal] look like they've gone backwards.' VIDEO We didn't perform until final whistle - Wenger .","Jamie Carragher tells Sky Sports it's the 'same old Arsenal' after defeat .

"Forget global warming – the Earth may soon be plunged into a 250-year cooling period, scientists have claimed. Russian climate experts believe that every 200 years the Sun’s activity temporarily wanes and it emits less heat. They believe this ‘cooling period’ could cause the earth’s average temperature to fall by several degrees. Scientists believe that every 200 years the Sun emits less heat, resulting in a big freeze . The last time this occurred was between 1650 and 1850 – a period known as the ‘Little Ice Age’. At the time, most of Britain’s rivers would freeze over during the bitter winters. Contemporary paintings show people could even cross the Thames using ice skates. The next ‘cooling period’ is scheduled to start between 2030 and 2040. But scientists from Pulkovo Observatory in St Petersburg think the cold period is unlikely to be as harsh as the last one. Researcher Yuri Nagovitsyn said: ‘Evidently, solar activity is on the decrease. ‘In this respect, we could be in for a cooling period that lasts 200 to  250 years. Scientists at the Pulkovo Observatory say the cooling period is unlikely to be as hash as the last one . Britain may continue to experience harsh winters as the cooling period takes hold . ‘The period of low solar activity could start between 2030 and 2040 but it won’t be as pervasive as in the late 17th century.’ And Vladimir Kotlyakov, from the Russian Academy of Sciences, said: ‘There are no grounds to claim that global warming will continue till the end of this century. ‘Climate moves in natural cycles of warmer and colder, as well as drier and more humid times. ‘Early signs of cooling are already there and the trend may pick up in coming years. ‘Human activity and industrial discharges do have a great impact on the environment, but forces of nature are far more powerful.’","Russian scientists believe the Sun emits less heat every 200 years .

"HANDS OFF IN THE BOX is our new campaign to rid football of the dark arts of the penalty box. Whether it is wrestling, grappling, shirt pulling - or the outrageous headlocks witnessed in the Manchester United vs Chelsea match - the area has become a free-for-all for cheating. And that means fewer goals in the Barclays Premier League. For too long, referees have failed to punish players for blatantly stopping opponents from scoring. It's time to end that. So join us in our campaign to say Hands Off In The Box to players and referees. We’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it. It was more like a WWE Tag Team match than a game of football. In the red corner, Manchester United's Marcos Rojo and Chris Smalling. In the blue corner, Chelsea's John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic. As the whistle blew, all hell broke loose. Rojo took Terry out the equation with a headlock, wrestling him to the ground with a throw a judoka would be proud of. Smalling grappled with Ivanovic, managing to twist his arm around the Chelsea defender's neck before dragging him to the ground. Ivanovic bellowed out, imploring referee Phil Dowd to award what appeared to be an obvious penalty. But Dowd shook his head, the ball flew across goal, the danger passed. 2-0 to the Red team. Both grapples, by the letter of the law, should have been penalties as the subsequent replays made painfully apparent. If this WWE behaviour - a headlock, for goodness sake - had happened anywhere else on the pitch, there would have been no hesitation. Free-kick. Yellow card. Perhaps more. So why is this rough and tumble going unpunished in the penalty box? Bodychecking, or actual bodygrabbing in most instances, inside the box MUST be stamped out. Referees and assistants need to toughen up - surely they can see this stuff happening? Why don't they intervene every time? Yes, there have always been dark arts in the penalty area. Pinching, nudging, shirt-grabbing, an unkind word in the ear. But this is an escalation. This penalty box incident caused controversy in Sunday's Manchester United vs Chelsea clash - on the left, Branislav Ivanovic wrestles with Chris Smalling while on the right, John Terry grapples Marcos Rojo . Smalling appears to blatantly pull down  Ivanovic in the penalty area as the free-kick is taken . Ivanovic is holding on to Smalling after being dragged down in the area by the Manchester United defender . The Chelsea defender appeals to Phil Dowd shortly after the incident but a penalty is not given . We are getting to a situation where set-pieces in football resemble a 'down' in NFL. Certain players don't even watch the ball, they concentrate on a man. The aim is not to clear the ball, it's to block off the run of their opponent. Managers will be getting out the playbook soon. And if referees are willing to let this grappling and wrestling continue, then managers will continue to actively encourage it as a defensive tactic. It would be shameful if this kind of thing is being coached. The football authorities managed to clamp down on reckless challenges from behind. Players know these will result in a yellow or red card, there is no advantage to be gained. Chelsea defenders Terry and Ivanovic go to ground after they were held in the box . This reverse angle shows Rojo push Terry to the floor while Smalling can be seen with his arm around the neck of Ivanovic in the background . You could argue it should be two penalties. It’s not just Chris Smalling on Ivanovic, you've got Rojo on Terry. The two have virtually got them in headlocks. From Dowd’s position he should see this. You can tell by Ivanovic’s reaction; he’s not just appealing — he’s going berserk. The Manchester United ones are worse than Shawcross (versus Swansea) last week. Now, they must eradicate bodychecking in the box by encouraging the award of more penalties. Referee Michael Oliver did just that in the Stoke City vs Swansea City match last weekend when Ryan Shawcross wrestled Wilfried Bony to the ground. He had the courage to point to the spot. Liverpool's Martin Skrtel has also been punished for grappling inside the box, including for one clash with Bony in a match at Anfield last season. But far too many instances still go unpunished. There is no consistency on this issue. Sky Sports reviewed the incident at half-time and showed both Terry and Ivanovic being held in the box . Smalling can clearly be seen to have his arm wrapped around Ivanovic's neck as the ball is delivered . Terry is half-way to the ground while Ivanovic is unable to jump as the ball is fizzed across . The issue has been looked at before. In France before the 2006-07 season, DVDs were sent to every club to highlight fouls in the box that would be penalised. It briefly worked. PSG defender Mario Yepes conceded four penalties in the first five matches of the season but, after initial success, the enthusiasm petered out. Some argue that in such congested and claustrophobic situations as free-kicks and corners, you'd see 20 penalties awarded in every game. No, this simply wouldn't happen. The concession of one penalty (possibly two) would be a strong deterrent. Players and coaches would quickly learn the lesson. There are ways of defending set-plays without resorting to wrestling moves. Dowd could have set a powerful precedent by punishing either Smalling or Rojo and awarding a penalty. This was a massive match, which unfolded before the eyes of the whole world. Stoke's Ryan Shawcross (right) did concede a penalty for this grapple with Swansea's Wilfried Bony last week . The pair clashed in the penalty area and referee Michael Oliver saw fit to point to the spot . Liverpool's Martin Skrtel has also been penalised in the past for penalty area blocking . If he missed the actual incident, then he must have seen Ivanovic's impassioned plea. He is also linked via earpiece to the assistant, who should have been watching attentively too. Perhaps we need the additional assistants seen in some European competitions, surely spotting incidents like this is their purpose? As with the other infringements and moments of gamesmanship that have plagued the game, action can and must be taken to end this penalty area WWE. THE BEAR HUG . Simple but effective. Stop the opposition by wrapping your arms around them and preventing them from moving. Surprisingly, this is rarely penalised by referees. THE HEADLOCK . A risky ploy because it’s a more obvious foul. Stops the opposition from moving and can also handily obscure their vision of what’s going on. THE FOREARM SMASH . A favourite of goalkeepers, who often feel targeted themselves. Stops any attacker in his tracks and makes them think twice about challenging for the ball. THE SUBTLE SHIRT PULL . With so many bodies in the box, this can be easy to miss. Defenders only need a slight tug to put off an attacker, but that can be more than enough to prevent a goal. THE TUMBLE AND FALL . An evolution of the bear hug. After grabbing a man, defenders can haul them to the ground while making it look like they’re the ones being bundled over. MARTIN KEOWN . Smalling grappled with Ivanovic, managing to twist his arm around the Chelsea defender's neck before dragging him to the ground. Ivanovic bellowed out, imploring referee Phil Dowd to award what appeared to be an obvious penalty. But Dowd shook his head, the ball flew across goal, the danger passed. 2-0 to the Red team. Both grapples, by the letter of the law, should have been penalties as the subsequent replays made painfully apparent. If this WWE behaviour - a headlock, for goodness sake - had happened anywhere else on the pitch, there would have been no hesitation. Free-kick. Yellow card. Perhaps more. So why is this rough and tumble going unpunished in the penalty box? Bodychecking, or actual bodygrabbing in most instances, inside the box MUST be stamped out. John Terry, Chelsea captain . ‘Me and Branislav Ivanovic were double headlocked at every corner.’ Colin Pascoe, Liverpool assistant manager . ‘Grappling. That is the new word is it? It is the referees’ interpretation and we’ll leave it to them. That’s what the referees and the officials are paid for. They make decisions. So whatever they decide is grappling, or holding, it’s in their hands really. Did I do it as player? No, I was a winger and didn’t have to mark anyone.’ ian wright Ex-Arsenal striker . ‘There should be an official specifically looking for holding in the box from set-pieces. It was like UFC in the United area.’ Graham Poll, Former top referee . ‘Hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned. Once fans, managers and — crucially — players accept it as normal, this campaign will have achieved its aims.’ Martin Keown, Ex-Arsenal defender . ‘Defenders are checking, blocking, holding, grappling, using force to foul opponents — and too often referees are allowing it to take place.’ Micky Mellon, Shrewsbury Town manager . ‘In a congested area how can you judge if someone’s been blocked? It’s part of the game and some people are good at it. It’s football. A local Football League referee came in and he was asking me about it. “Can you show me some blocking techniques?” That was great, he was trying to find ways of detecting it. The confusing thing for managers is that fouls outside the area are given as free-kicks, but the same won’t be given as penalties. There has to be consistency.’ And the readers of MailOnline... ‘It’s more infuriating because we never hear from the refs themselves. It’s about time the refs were made to answer the media just like players.’ Willdajack, Neath . ‘To those saying if there was a clampdown every game would be littered with penalties, that would be true for a couple of weeks then it would stop. I’ve been watching football since the Sixties and the cheating behaviour in the penalty area now is the worst I’ve ever seen.’ Sir Miles Platting, Manchester .

"Penny for the thoughts of Paul Merson, the former Arsenal striker who branded Arsene Wenger 'tactically clueless' after they surrendered a 3-0 lead against Anderlecht in the Champions League. Arsenal weren't held by a Belgian club on Sunday, though. Instead it was a Welsh side that beat the north London club and moved above them in the Barclays Premier League table in doing so. Arsenal again capitulated in a second half with Swansea City the grateful recipients this time. Arsene Wenger let a three-goal lead slip against Anderlecht on Tuesday and was beaten by Swansea City . Arsenal let their lead slip against Swansea as the Welsh club beat the Gunners 2-1 at the Liberty Stadium . Sanchez saw his goal go to waste as Arsenal lost 2-1 against Swansea on Sunday afternoon at the Liberty . Click here for all the statistics, goals and heat maps from our Match Zone service . Television pundit Merson accused Arsenal of being 'like an Under-12 team, all bombing forward', and Wenger responded with a personal attack on the player he once managed. 'I managed him. I tried. I'm not interested in Paul Merson. These debates I hear are a joke, a farce,' the Frenchman said. But amid Wenger vs Merson, Arsenal had a match at the Liberty Stadium to prepare for. Swansea threatened more in the first 45 minutes. Arsenal were rarely given  time to mount an attack with their 4-4-2 system, though they ended the half the stronger. Arsenal forwards Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck had one shot to show between them by the break, and it came from the former Manchester United player in the 44th minute. A clever one-two left Welbeck with only Lukasz Fabianski to beat on an angle. The ex-Arsenal goalkeeper made an instinctive save, and it remained 0-0 in monsoon-like conditions. Danny Welbeck takes the only shot between him and Alexis Sanchez during an unimpressive first half . Welbeck sees his shot saved by former Arsenal and now Swansea goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski on Sunday .

An Aaron Ramsey volley here, a Per Mertesacker header there, but neither could trouble Fabianski. Wenger instructed his team to use their pace and cease the predictability that hindered them in the first half. They did so, as Sanchez mustered his first shot in the 61st minute. Then, the partnership worked. An Arsenal counter-attack saw Welbeck sprint down the right, before cutting inside and assisting Sanchez to score his eighth Premier League goal in 10 games. But, as against Anderlecht on Tuesday night, Wenger's men lost their way in the latter stages. Again, former Barcelona forward Sanchez saw another of his goals go to  waste. In three minutes Arsenal went from 1-0 up to 2-1 down - and they have Manchester United next. Wenger has managed just four Premier League wins this season and, if actions speak louder than words, the Arsenal boss did little to prove Merson wrong.

"It was an incredible sight that was witnessed by about 130 whale watchers, who had been spending their Sunday afternoon cruising on Sydney Harbour. A 40 tonne humpback whale put on a spectacular aerial display as it breached 2km off the entrance of Sydney Harbour at about 3.30pm. Stunning images of the magnificently mammoth sea creature were captured by cruise director of Whale Watching Sydney Jonas Liebschner, who was ready for the money shot. 'It only jumped once so I was very lucky to see that,' he said. 'And it was a perfect way to finish off the day as the tour was coming to an end.' Mr Liebschner says the whales are migration north to warmer waters for mating season. 'It's near the end of the migration season but they'll be coming back in a few months time,' he said, . Mr Liebschner says there have been about 20,000 whales migrating past Sydney this year with an annual increase of about 10 per cent. 'I've been doing this job for seven years now and it gets easier every year because we're seeing more and more of them,' he said. When they return back for the southern migration, Mr Liebschner says there will be about 2000 calves swimming with their mothers through Sydney Harbour around October and November.

"University of Sydney ecologist Lizzy Lowe found that spiders thrive in Sydney's rich suburbs . Spiders have embraced city life and are living it up in Sydney's affluent suburbs as recent research found they are bigger and more fertile in these areas. The study revealed golden orb weaving spiders were particularly thriving in Tamarama Beach - just a km away from Bondi in Sydney's eastern suburbs. The research, conducted by PhD student Lizzie Lowe from the University of Sydney, found the largest golden orb weighed three grams and was as big as the palm of her hand. And their webs can measure up to three metres. The smaller spiders were found in rural sites such as the Brisbane Waters National Park, near the Central Coast - north of Sydney, where the smallest measured 0.5 grams. The study, published on Wednesday in science journal POS ONE, discovered the commonly feared eight-legged arthropods preferred urbanised cities rather than country-living. Ms Lowe put this down to the fact that these fanged creatures enjoy living by the coast and big open areas. The golden orb spider are particularly fatter and more fertile as they prefer city living . Ms Lowe further suggested the concrete structures help retain heat better than their natural habitat, which may give them more energy to reproduce and also help them survive longer than their six-month lifespan. She also found female spiders from the city had larger ovaries, which meant they either had larger eggs or were producing more offspring. Ms Lowe believes the findings could be the result of wealthier suburbs spending more money on land management, which creates a healthier habitat for spiders. She stressed that the increasing population of golden orbs in the city is highly beneficial for the ecosystem as they help control flies, mosquitoes and other insects. 'It's really not a bad thing that they're getting bigger because they are such an important part of our ecosystem,' she said. 'It's fascinating that these spiders are adapting and surviving in our ever-changing landscape and it's something we should encourage.' The spiders are particularly fond of Tamarama Beach, Sydney's eastern suburbs, just a km away from Bondi .","The research was conducted by PhD student Lizzie Lowe from the University of Sydney .

"Read Matt Barlow's match report from the Liberty Stadium here . Alan Shearer and Martin Keown are the latest pundits to slam Arsenal's leaky defence after their 2-1 defeat by Swansea on Sunday, asking why the likes of experienced centre-half Per Mertesacker could not organise the back line when they led at the Liberty Stadium. Speaking on Match of the Day 2, former Newcastle striker Shearer blasted Arsene Wenger's side for having so many men ahead of the ball with 16 minutes left while winning 1-0. Pictures show eight yellow shirts ahead of the ball in Swansea's half before the equaliser, with Bafetimbi Gomis breaking before Gylfi Sigurdsson won a free-kick. The Icelandic midfielder scored the resulting set-piece before Gomis' winner. Alan Shearer and Martin Keown believe Per Mertesacker should have organised the defence better . With Arsenal 1-0 up, eight players were ahead of the ball as Swansea moved forward in search of an equaliser . Shearer said: 'Arsenal have actually worked their socks off to get themselves in a winning position. 'Ten minutes later you've got seven people ahead of the ball in the final third. Per Mertesacker should be screaming to at least two or three of them to ""get back, give me some protection, we're winning 1-0, we don't need another goal."" It's naive.' In midweek, Arsenal were 3-0 up against Anderlecht at the Emirates in the second half, but the Belgian side fought back to earn a draw. With Arsenal leading 3-2 in the final moments, five of their players were ahead of the ball in the attacking final third, with the visitors going down the other end to score. Alexis Sanchez (left) can't hide his dismay after Swansea's second goal as it meant Arsenal lost another lead . Arsene Wenger (centre) looks dejected as Swansea take a 2-1 lead at the Liberty Stadium . Shearer also admitted young defender Calum Chambers had an afternoon to forget in south Wales, tasked with marking man of the match Jefferson Montero at right-back. 'I am amazed Chambers lasted so long on the pitch,' Shearer said. 'He's young, still learning, but from the first minute he struggled. I'm amazed he wasn't taken off.' Former Arsenal defender Keown believes they should have learned from these mistakes, particularly Mertesacker. '[Mertesacker's] in the team to organise it, get that shield in place and position people. 'When you're 1-0 up, to throw it away like they did, after what happened in midweek.' Gylfi Sigurdsson (No 23) brought the Swans back into the game with a beautiful free-kick into the top corner . Bafetimbi Gomis (2nd left) climbed highest in the Arsenal box to head home Swansea's winner . Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher was also scathing in his analysis of Wenger's tactics, even referencing his summer business in the transfer market as a reason why the club are struggling. He added: 'Chelsea and Arsenal seem miles apart - and that's just because [Jose] Mourinho identified what he needed. His team now look unstoppable as a result. 'They let [Thomas] Vermaelen go and they didn't replace him, these small details always cost Arsenal at the top. 'This stage last year they were top of the league with a healthy lead. The problem for Arsenal, and any team, is that you want to feel like you're making progress. Calum Chambers (left) struggled to cope with Jefferson Montero's pace ahead of Swansea's winner . Sanchez had fired Arsenal into the lead with his 12th goal of the season in all competitions . 'They won the FA Cup. The next level, having won a trophy, they should make two or three big signings. 'But with Arsenal you never feel they're going to make those big signings to take you there. 'They had a better season than Chelsea, but now they feel miles apart.

"Paul Scholes has labelled Louis van Gaal a ‘mad genius’ as the Manchester United manager prepares for his first Barclays Premier League game against Swanseaon Saturday. Scholes says the Dutch coach is prone to ‘going off his head’ when his team fail to follow orders during training sessions or matches. The former United midfielder, also criticised his former club for failing to bid for Toni Kroos, signed by Real Madrid for £20million, or former Barcelona midfielder Cesc Fabregas. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Paul Scholes say Schweinsteiger asked for his shirt . Criticism: Man United legend Paul Scholes believes the club should have signed a world-class midfielder . Instant respect: Louis van Gaal is a mad genius and is prone to 'going off his head', according to Scholes . ‘From what I’ve seen (Van Gaal) looks a bit mad. He’s a bit like a mad genius, a bit crazy. He’s obviously very good at his job from where he’s been. I’ve not seen him work  but I have seen clips on the telly and one moment he’s hugging someone for doing a great pass and the next, if something’s not right, he’s going off his head. He’s brought a bit of fear, which is no bad thing. 'I played for 20 years for Sir Alex Ferguson and he could be a scary man. Fear can bring performances from you. There’s no doubt these players need to perform this year. If they don’t, I don’t think they’ll be there for very long. ‘Players will know where they stand, which is what you want. You knew where you stood with Sir Alex from what you’d done on the Saturday. If you’d done well, he’d pat you on the back. If you hadn’t, you probably wouldn’t be playing the next week.’ United finished seventh in the Premier League last season and fired manager David Moyes in April after they lost to Everton. Presence: Scholes compared Van Gaal to former boss Sir Alex Ferguson and said both are 'scary' managers . Now Scholes believes Champions League qualification will be seen as a success in Van Gaal’s first season, insisting they have no chance of winning the title. ‘Success will be the Champions League,’ he said. ‘It’s between City and Chelsea (for the title). The next two places are between United, Liverpool and Arsenal. ‘There are a lot of players in that (United) team who have won leagues before. They are capable of getting close. We’ll have to see how good the manager is, and if he can bring a couple more players in, although he might think he has enough as it is. Chelsea and Man City have got stronger squads but in the end, squads don’t matter - it’s what you do on the field. ‘In May, hopefully United will be proving people like me wrong.’ In the hotseat: Scholes believes Champions League qualification will be seen as a success during Van Gaal's first season in charge . VIDEO Januzaj new no11, van Gaal chasing Rojo . Scholes was puzzled by United’s failure to bid for world-class players such as Kroos, Bastian Schweinsteiger or former Arsenal midfielder Fabregas. ‘A Fabregas, a Toni Kroos or a Schweinsteiger could add real quality to the team, but that’s up to the manager,’ Scholes added. He also claimed confidence was at an all-time low at United when he was brought in with Ryan Giggs for the final four games of last season after Moyes’ dismissal. BT Sport’s new pundit has dismissed Arsenal’s title chances, despite their 3-0 victory over champions Manchester City in the Community Shield last weekend. ‘(Alexis) Sanchez is a good signing but is that the type of player they need?’ he said. ‘They needed a top centre half and a strong midfield player. If they had that, they could challenge.’ World-class: Scholes believes Real Madrid signing Toni Kroos and Chelsea new boy Cesc Fabregas were the only top-level midfielders available this summer .

"Six lions at Longleat Safari Park have been put down, triggering  outrage among staff who claim there was no obvious reason for the animals to be killed. An adult male called Henry, a lioness named Louisa and four of her cubs were all put to death last month in an operation supervised by vets. Bosses at the safari park on the Marquess of Bath’s Wiltshire estate insist the decision was taken because of ‘health risks’ after a population increase led to violent behaviour. At play: Lions and cubs, left, from the pride that was culled by vets at Longleat, pictured three weeks . But former workers in the lion reserve have questioned whether the animals should have been destroyed, and revealed that some employees were in tears when they found out what had happened. The lions are one of the biggest attractions at Longleat, which opened in 1966 as Britain’s first wildlife safari park. Less than three weeks ago, members of the famous Longleat pride were photographed playing happily in the park, with one leaping 30ft from an oak tree, landing on all fours with a precision which astonished onlookers. A whistleblower told The Mail on Sunday that the lions were injected with a lethal substance from a tranquiliser gun. Former workers in the lion reserve have questioned whether the animals should have been destroyed . Visitors were offered no explanation for the lions’ absence yesterday when the park reopened after the long winter break. Louisa arrived in 2011 from her previous home at Noah’s Ark Zoo Farm at Wraxall in Somerset. She soon became part of a new pride and a mother to a litter of cubs  – as well as a close companion of another first-time mother, Nikata. A keeper caring for the new arrivals spoke at the time of how the pair enjoyed rough and tumble games with their cubs – who weighed just two pounds at birth – and seemed very protective of their offspring. A Noah’s Ark Zoo spokesman said yesterday: ‘We have been told nothing. Apart from health problems, I can’t think of any other reason why a lion like Louisa would have to be put down. We will be contacting Longleat for more information.’ One of the world’s leading big cat experts, consultant vet John Knight, said he was baffled. ‘On the face of it this seems like an odd thing to do. Longleat would not take such a decision lightly because they know how much it would upset their keepers.’ Guernsey-based Mr Knight, whose career has included consultancy work with the World Wildlife Fund and the Born Free Foundation, said: ‘This could be part of a conservation programme. It is a debatable reason for putting down a lioness and  her cubs but until all the details emerge it is difficult to understand their thinking. ‘Most zoos have a contraceptive programme in place and manage to control populations perfectly well. ‘That’s why this seems a bit odd, in a way. It’s just not a problem that most zoos experience. It does seem such a shame that so many young animals have been involved.’ Another big cat expert, Andrew Greenwood of the International Zoo Vet Group, said zoos did need to restrict breeding. ‘Lions take up space and zoos don’t always want them,’ he said. ‘Putting the animal down is not a welfare issue as long as it is done properly.’ Stately home: The grounds of Longleat House, pictured, host one of Britain's leading wildlife collections . According to the whistleblower, Henry was put down in early January. The former employee said: ‘I don’t think there was a reason to do it. He had been vasectomised so he couldn’t breed. Henry could have been sold to another zoo. ‘It all happened while the park was closed for the winter so no one knew what was going on.  A lot of people who know what happened are very upset and angry.’ A Longleat spokesman said last night: ‘There has been a large increase in pregnancies among the lions, resulting in a 40 per cent increase in population. This has resulted in excessive violent behaviour, putting 21 of them at risk. ‘Sadly one lion, Henry, had to be put down earlier this year due to injuries from an attack within the enclosure. The further lions referred to were put down due to associated and severe health risks. ‘A further five lions from this enclosure will be moved to other premises. Longleat takes the utmost care in trying to protect the welfare and safety of all its animals.","Henry the lion, Louisa the lioness and four cubs were killed last month .

But, just occasionally, a book comes along that is not only interesting, but might — just might — be of some conceivable help to someone. This, I believe, is one such. Niven, an American psychologist and social scientist, and by no means the long-deceased star of The Guns Of Navarone, sets out to help us ‘solve unsolvable problems’. While he doesn’t, because they’re unsolvable, he does help us solve problems that look unsolvable but aren’t — which, I suppose, is the next best thing. Steven Spielberg had spent the Jaws' entire original budget on one prop, a mechanical shark (stock picture) The shark in question was the one in Jaws. Steven Spielberg had spent the film’s entire original budget on one prop, a mechanical shark which, on film, looked exactly like a mechanical shark. Not only was it not scary, but in saltwater ‘even its synthetic skin failed, as it became waterlogged and bloated, transforming the terrifying shark into a giant sea marshmallow’. What to do? Niven says that, when we have a problem, many of us are overwhelmed by it. ‘Like staring at the sun and not being able to see the sky all around it, we stare at our problems and cannot see anything else, much less a solution.’ Spielberg didn’t stare at his problem. He just asked himself, ‘What would Alfred Hitchcock do?’ And he realised that the answer was not to show the shark at all, if possible. As his star Richard Dreyfuss said, with admiration: ‘He had to invent, on the spot, another way of shooting, which was to imply the shark, which made an ordinary film into a great film.’ Problems, of course, are everywhere. People can’t make decisions, so hamstrung are they by the fear of making the wrong decision. Niven tells the story of the sitcom Seinfeld, one of two pilots made by NBC one summer. The studio audience detested it. NBC executives could see the show’s potential, but no one had the courage to go out on a creative limb, so they instead ordered something called Sister Kate, which was bland, familiar and utterly unexceptional. It barely lasted a year. In the meantime, Seinfeld squeaked in through the back door. Eventually, it would be making NBC $300 million a year. Jerry Seinfeld now keeps a framed copy of that original audience report on his desk, as does the executive who originally said no. A lot of what Niven says is pretty obvious, but worth saying anyway. People in groups tend to make worse decisions than individuals: indeed, they will sometimes make decisions that none of them individually agrees with (this would explain a few Booker Prize winners). Sometimes, we think the way to solve a problem is to try harder, work longer hours, put in more effort. Niven comes up with examples to show that this can make the problem worse. As he puts it: ‘There is a giant hole in the equation Incentive + Harder Work = Better Outcome.’ Ask yourself what Hitchcock would do. Go for a walk. Let the solution come to you when you’re least expecting it. Niven can be very American in his assumptions and his tone of voice. But there’s very little of the forced cheerfulness that can bring up your breakfast with a single heave. His arguments are sound, his stories intriguing — and your muesli safe. If there’s any higher praise for a self-help book, I can’t imagine it.","David Niven says that, when we have a problem, we are overwhelmed by it .

"It is easy to pick on Juan Mata. He is not blessed with pace, he’s not a big player and he comes across as a quiet, humble guy. But you cannot argue with what he produces on the pitch. He came off the bench to save Manchester United against Crystal Palace and he must be wondering what more he has to do to play regular football at Old Trafford. Juan Mata (right) hits the ball through a crowd of Crystal Palace players to score Manchester United's winner . Mata celebrates his goal, just minutes after he came on as a substitute . The Spaniard readies himself to replace Adnan Januzaj but Mata is better then being a super sub at United . 11 - Juan Mata has been involved in 11 goals in his last 15 PL games for Man United. He has scored nine and set up two. There is no doubting his quality — this is a player with a World Cup and European Championship to his name. But he found himself surplus to requirements at Chelsea and now seems to be in a similar position at Manchester United. You have to credit him because he never causes a fuss or has a bad word to say. But make no mistake. He wants to play football. He is too good to be a super sub at United and if he doesn’t get some more action, I could see him moving on or maybe even back to Spain. AUSTIN'S IN DREAMLAND . Every weekend people up and down the country wake up and dream of playing football in the Premier League. That’s why Charlie Austin’s is such a great story. Five years ago he was playing non-league football for Poole. Now he is rubbing shoulders with the likes of Sergio Aguero. He looks like he’s loving each second in the Premier League and he deserves every bit of it. Charlie Austin does a chicken dance - part of a dare organised by Soccer AM - after his goal on Saturday . The QPR striker slides the ball under Joe Hart to make it 1-0 and carry on his good recent form . 12 - Sergio Aguero (Manchester City) 10 - Diego Costa (Chelsea) 8 - Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal) 7 - Saido Berahino (West Brom) 6 - Charlie Austin (QPR); Nacer Chadli (Spurs); Graziano Pelle (Southampton): Daifra Sakho (West Ham) For some players, life can be too easy, especially if they get huge wages at such a young age. After the journey he has been on, there’s no danger of Austin not appreciating where he is. He is a throwback but he is a quality player. I worried when he missed a penalty on the opening day but he has proved himself with some fantastic goals. He still has work to do, but he wants to improve and I like that about him. He certainly needs to work on his goal celebration! His dance was part of a dare organised on Sky’s Soccer AM programme, but he had to have a couple of cracks at it after having a goal disallowed. His rise up the leagues has been a dream but it just goes to show that sometimes it’s never too late to make it in the big time. Austin heads in one of two disallowed goals he scored in the draw against City . Austin looks as if he is loving it in the Premier League and the only way is up . CHELSEA'S CASE FOR THE DEFENCE . Much of the focus on Chelsea this season has centred around their attacking power: Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas, Eden Hazard. It’s easy to pick out and praise the players who are firing in the goals. But their defensive unit has been just as important, if not more so, in their success so far. At the moment it looks like they have the perfect combination of goalkeeper and back four. John Terry is still a huge player for them and is obviously doing a fine job of improving Gary Cahill alongside him. Branislav Ivanovic is solid as a rock at right back and Cesar Azpilicueta did brilliantly to set up Costa’s goal at Anfield. Thibaut Courtois is a huge presence behind them and Nemanja Matic must be a dream to have in front of your back four, always protecting the defence and putting out fires. At the end of the Liverpool game Chelsea’s defenders came together for a huddle. If they keep that unit working for the rest of the season they will be hard to stop. Chelsea's defensive players have not had as much praise as the likes of Eden Hazard (third right) but they have been integral to their club's charge to the top of the Premier League table . John Terry (second right) looks as if he is straining every sinew in his bid to keep Liverpool at bay . CITY HAVE TO MIND THE GAP . Sergio Aguero aside, City have been poor this season. At times they have been a one-man team. It was a fantastic game against QPR but whatever Manuel Pellegrini says, they were lucky to escape Loftus Road with a point on Saturday. They had a slow start last season — they were six points off the top at the same stage — and came back to win it. But the landscape of the league has changed. Chelsea look so strong and if City aren’t careful they could be out of the running before they know it. The international break has come at a good time because they desperately need something to change and soon. Sergio Aguero scores his second goal of the game against QPR - at times City look like a one-man team . City are struggling at the back and Martin Demichelis (second right) scores an own goal at Loftus Road . A MASTERCLASS FROM MONTERO . The South American invasion is in full swing in the Premier League, but not many people would have expected an Ecuadorian to upstage a Chilean on Sunday. Alexis Sanchez looked like he had won it for Arsenal, but Swansea completed a magnificent fightback thanks in no small part to Jefferson Montero. He put on an exhibition of old-school wing play. He was strong, quick and went past Calum Chambers at will. It’s not a game the young defender will want to watch back, but he should do so he can learn from the experience because Montero was magnificent. Jefferson Montero (left) was superb for Swansea against Arsenal and gave Calum Chambers a torrid time . A MUCH NEEDED WIN TO BOOST BURNLEY . It has been a rough ride for Burnley on their return to the Premier League. I’m a fan of Sean Dyche and what he’s done at the club, but they really needed a result to kick-start their season, which they got against Hull. Ashley Barnes (centre) is congratulated by George Boyd (right) after scoring the winner against Hull . Burnley need last season's strike pairing of Danny Ings (left) and Sam Vokes back together . 47 - goals scored by Danny Ings and Sam Vokes in all competitions in 2013-14. It’s all well and good getting draws but what they really needed was three points on the board. At times they have defended well this season and kept a clean sheet against Hull, but what they really need is goals. They miss Sam Vokes, who was so deadly with Danny Ings last season. Once Vokes returns from injury, he will be desperate to fire Burnley up the league. VIDEO Dyche delighted with first win of the season .","Juan Mata just wants to play at Manchester United - he could move .

"An aspiring model who was forced to abandon her career after developing a rare condition has finally achieved her dreams by landing a job as a disabled model. Chelsey Jay, 23, was horrified when she was struck down with a condition known as Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (PoTS) which caused her to faint every time she stood up. Chelsey, from Witham, Essex, suddenly became confined to a wheelchair, and was forced to quit her modelling dreams. Dream come true: Chelsey Jay was horrified when she was struck down with a rare condition known as Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (PoTS) which caused her to faint every time she stood up but has since landed a modelling career . But in a remarkable change of fortune, she has managed to secure a contract with a disabled modelling company, and has gone on to model for big name brands such as online fashion store, Boohoo. Chelsey said: 'When I was diagnosed with PoTS I thought my dreams were over. 'I’d just started modelling, then suddenly I was crawling around the house on my knees and using a wheelchair - I even had to sit down to brush my teeth. 'But after talking about my experiences online I caught the attention of a modeling agency called Models Of Diversity. 'They campaign to get more diversity within the modeling industry, and before long they signed me up. 'Now, my life has completely changed - I’ve modelled for brands like Boohoo, and done the catwalk at lots of different events. 'I might not be able to walk the catwalk like the other girls do, but I give it my all in my wheelchair instead. Finding fame: Chelsey has secured a contract with a disabled modelling company, and has gone on to model for big name brands such as online fashion store, Boohoo . Scouted: After talking about her experiences online, she caught the attention of a modeling agency called Models Of Diversity . Lifestyle change: Chelsey, pictured before she was wheelchair bound, said: 'It was really hard at first. I'm always the loud, lively one that loves a laugh, but suddenly my life was different' 'Whenever I do a shoot I ask the photographer to tell me exactly what they want - and I’ll do everything I can to do it. 'I might not be able to stand up, but I can model just as well as anyone else. 'I thought I was going to have to give up on my dreams, but now I’m living them.' Chelsey was struck down with PoTS during a busy shift on the stroke ward Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford. Chelsey said: 'I had a 15 hour shift ahead of me on the ward and I was just getting started. Hard worker: Whenever she does a shoot, Chelsey asks the photographer to tell her exactly what they want - and she will then do everything she can to do it . Adaptable: Chelsey said: 'I might be different to other models but I never let my disability phase me. People think disabled people are incapable of certain things, but we just adapt' 'I was fine and then all of a sudden felt faint. I hadn’t had breakfast so I assumed it was that. 'I went to the staff room to grab something to eat, and when I came back out I fainted. 'Everyone ran towards me and the next thing I knew I’d been taken to A&E. Apparently I was unresponsive and people were really worried. 'It was really scary, I had no idea what was happening to me.' Chelsey began a long process of referrals, tests and investigations before finally being diagnosed with the condition in October 2012. Young love: Chelsey Jay with boyfriend Ashley before she became wheelchair bound . She said: 'It was really hard at first. I’m always the loud, lively one that loves a laugh, but suddenly my life was different. I had a wheelchair and a mobility scooter and everything changed.' But after speaking about her experiences online, she was spotted by Models Of Diversity. Chelsey said: 'I met up with them and almost immediately I was doing a photo shoot for Boohoo. 'It was just such a whirlwind and now I’m constantly busy either modeling or campaigning. 'I might be different to other models but I never let my disability phase me. On shoots I’m always professional and try to do exactly what the photographer wants, people think disabled people are incapable of certain things, but we just adapt. 'I’ll lay down, or sit, and try lots of different poses - I’m not just a one trick pony. Doing catwalk in a wheelchair is daunting, but I just go for it. 'You’d think the reaction to a disabled model might be confusion or upset, but I only ever get positive reactions. 'The public are definitely ready to see disabled models in the fashion industry.' Now, Chelsey’s career is going from strength to strength. Chelsey said: 'I can’t quite believe how busy I am at the moment and how exciting everything is. 'Not only do I get to model, but I’m also the ambassador for disabled models at Models of Diversity, so I head the campaign to get the industry to use disabled models too. 'I’ve even had a meeting with an MP who is going to raise the issue in parliament. It’s about time we saw a change in the type of girls that are used in the fashion industry - everyone needs to be represented. Support system: Chelsey, who thanks her boyfriend Ashley for his support, has gone on to model for big name brands such as online fashion store, Boohoo . Long process: Chelsey began  referrals, tests and investigations before finally being diagnosed with the condition in October 2012 . Success story: A spokesperson for Models Of Diversity said: 'As soon as I met her I immediately saw her potential and I knew we were onto a winner' 'It’s crazy to think that just a year ago I thought my life was over. But thanks to Models Of Diversity, my amazing family, and my wonderful boyfriend Ashley, I couldn’t be happier.' Angel Sinclair, CEO, of Model’s Of Diversity, said: “Chelsey is a remarkable young woman. 'She is an incredibly brave person and I know she is going to make it as a known model. She campaigns tirelessly for models of diversity and is so selfless, she’s done incredible things for us. 'As soon as I met her I immediately saw her potential and I knew we were onto a winner. 'She’s modelled for Boohoo, for bridal shows, and she’s even modelled for Velvet Amour - Jean-Paul Gaultier’s first plus sized model. She goes to castings and most likely will be the only disabled model there, but she is always amazing. 'I’m very proud of her, she’s amazing.'

"Mauricio Pochettino told his under-achieving Tottenham stars to improve their attitude after a shocking 2-1 defeat against Stoke City. The Spurs chief was scathing in his assessment of his team after they slipped to their fourth home defeat in the Barclays Premier League at White Hart Lane. Pochettino, who humiliated Christian Eriksen and Andros Townsend by dragging them off at half-time, is struggling to make an impact at the club. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Mauricio Pochettino admits he needs a change in results, and quickly, after another defeat for Spurs . Erik Lamela and Harry Kane show their disappointment during another sloppy display from Tottenham . The furious Tottenham chief said: ‘We need to find the solution and I need to change the mentality for the players. ‘They know my feelings like I know their feelings. I have been here for four months, we know the players and the players know me. ‘We feel the same, very disappointed and frustrated, and not happy because our performance was not good enough. ‘It’s clear we need to improve a lot. We need to improve and this is clear to analyse. Always in football you need time, different methods and philosophy but we need to improve quick. ‘In football you never have time, a long time – you need to take a result. We need to find a solution quickly and in the next few weeks, we change our mentality and find a solution, this is my challenge in the next few weeks.’ Kyle Naughton's late red card added salt to the wound on a day when Spurs never really found their form . Bojan Krkic scored his first goal for Stoke and their lead was doubled when Jon Walters scored again before the break. Nacer Chadli gave Tottenham hope with a brilliant volley, but their changes of snatching an equaliser were lost when Kyle Naughton was given a straight red. Pochettiho added: ‘After we conceded the first goal we were uncomfortable in possession of the ball and took rash decisions. ‘It is not possible in the Premier League it is not possible to make these mistakes and we conceded the second goal. Bojan Krkic fires past Danny Rose after an excellent run, to score his first goal since joining Stoke City . The Spanish striker celebrates breaking his Stoke duck but Pochettino preferred to focus on the second goal . Jon Walters makes it 2-0, but Pochettino complained 'it is not possible to make these mistakes' ‘It’s true, the first half we played no good. In the second half we try to fix something to manage better the possession of the ball - they play very deep and create many chances but after 2-0 down it was difficult to change the game. When you lose always you are unhappy and put pressure on ourselves.’ Stoke were in complete control, even though Mark Hughes admitted he has had to be patient with Bojan. Hughes said: ‘We are really pleased that he is finally coming to the fore. He started off like a house on fire when he first joined us in pre-season and people got a little bit carried away too early because I think we all felt it was going to take time to adjust. Mark Hughes celebrates his side's win at White Hart Lane after keeping faith in Bojan, and being rewarded . ‘He has bided his time and I have just stared to reintroduce him now and he has had the benefit of three or four months training at the intensity he needs to and he looks a very accomplished player again. ‘We are going to benefit from his ability and his goal-scoring because he is a good talent when he gets in good areas of the field. He hits shots off early and its difficult for keepers to react early enough and he will score goals for us this year.’","Tottenham manager says ‘It’s clear we need to improve a lot'

All Blacks winger Ben Smith (left) and ambassador Lockwood Smith (centre) place a wreath on Monday . Thirteen All Blacks died during the First World War and Smith said: 'What was going through my mind actually was what if it was me that had to come over and go to war.

'I put myself in their shoes and it would have been tough on them and their families.' All Blacks stars Dane Coles, Charlie Faumuina and Luke Romanos at Monday's ceremony . Rugby was played at various points during the War. During a respite from Gallipoli, the Anzac soldiers organised a game on the island of Lemnos. They played with a football because no rugby ball could be found with the New Zealanders running in 13 tries to one. Another game was played in Paris in April 1917 against France for the Somme Cup.

"Brendan Rodgers has admitted Liverpool’s play has been left ‘a little broken’ by the significant overhaul of their squad this summer. The Liverpool manager, who believes victory in Saturday’s Merseyside derby will belatedly launch a season that has failed to get started, made nine new signings during the last transfer window, as well as selling Luis Suarez to Barcelona. Such a significant transition in personnel has seen Liverpool lose three of their first five  Premier League matches, with their performances being characterised by poor defending, and Rodgers is aware of how standards have dropped from last season’s dazzling brand. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers speaks to his players during a training session at Melwood on Thursday . Liverpool are missing striker Luis Suarez (top) who they sold to Barcelona for £75million this summer . Suarez scored 31 league goals for the Reds last season and Rodgers admits his absence has been a setback . Mario Balotelli has been brought in to replace the Uruguayan but will need time to fully settle in . That is why he believes Liverpool need to get back to the basics that served them so well last term and he has been encouraged by the squad’s willingness to learn from their mistakes. ‘I think at this moment in time we are re-focusing and reintroducing principles into our game that has brought the win ratio we’ve had in the last 18 months,’ said Rodgers. ‘Apart from the Tottenham game (won 3-0) we have moved away a bit from that. ‘Our game is based on fast pressing, a real high intensity and also the speed of our football. We put a lot of hard work in during the first six months that we were here and a lot of those processes became natural — the consequence of that is winning. Liverpool have lost three of their five Premier Lague matches and sit in a lowly 11th position . ‘When you introduce a raft of new players and lose the core of players, that’s obviously a factor and then it becomes a little bit broken. That’s how our game has looked for me for a big part of the season. Where I am fortunate is that I have a group of players here that identify with that. ‘We are all in this together and we need to get back to re-focus on what has allowed us to win games consistently over the last 18 months to two years. That has been about the way we play and imposing our style and strength on our opponents.’ Beating Everton, though, would provide a significant boost ahead of next Tuesday’s Champions League trip to Basle and Rodgers recognises it could dramatically alter the perception of his new arrivals if one were to score a winning goal. The expensive £25m summer signing Adam Lallana (left) has made a slow start to his Anfield career . New signing Javi Manquillo (left) was substituted after just 22 minutes at West Ham following a poor display . ‘Derby games give you a chance to be a hero and the players here are well aware of that,’ said Rodgers. ‘It’s a massive game to the supporters, a very special game. But it’s also for me about getting back to performing well. It’s important we get a victory and that will give us confidence.’ If Rodgers has issues to contend with so does Everton manager Roberto Martinez. He accepts his side’s defending has not been good enough, while he also feels Everton need to clear a mental barrier tomorrow, as it has been 15 years since they last won at Anfield. The Reds have been missing the injured Daniel Sturridge, but he could return against the Toffees . Rodgers (right) gets his point across to Liverpool's players in training on Thursday prior to playing Everton . Martinez said: ‘I think the psychology is a very important point because if you look at the stats, 15 years without a win at Anfield, then it needs to be a bit more than football. It can’t always be a football reason why you haven’t won a game over that period. ‘So I’ll accept that . . . we are ready to go anywhere. I’m not highlighting Anfield as a place we don’t look forward to. I think the mentality of the group is to go anywhere and focus on our performance. ‘Will it be a difficult game? Of course. They are in a position where they need to perform well at home and get points, but I don’t see that psychologically we are not ready to go to Anfield and be ourselves, that is the answer to the question.’ Like our MailOnline Sport Facebook page.

"It's not helpful to race relations in America to write off unhappiness with President Barack Obama's policies as race-based animosity, Ohio Senator Rob Portman said today. Even people who voted for Obama are disappointed, Portman told 'America's Newsroom' anchor Bill Hemmer on Fox News, 'and for good reason.' 'I don't think blaming the opposition to president Obama - which by the way is at record highs when you look at the polling data - blaming that on some sort of racial animus, I don’t think helps us,' Portman, said, responding to comments Attorney General Eric Holder said yesterday on the topic. Ohio Senator Rob Portman, pictured here during an onstage interview at the Peterson Foundation Fiscal Summit in May, said today it wasn't helpful for race relations to lump people who don't support the president's policies in with racists . Portman went on to cite polling that shows that disapproval of Obama is linked to his poor handling of the economy and irritation with the 2010 health care reform law, spearheaded by the president. The Republican Senator also pointed to gridlock on Capitol Hill as another source of anxiety for many Americans. 'And so, I think there's a lot of frustration, and there's a lot of opposition and its grounded not in some sort of animus to him, but in the fact that he just can't seem to get the results people are looking for,' he said. Yesterday Holder told ABC News that some people who disagree 'There's a certain level of vehemence, it seems to me, that's directed at me [and] directed at the president. You know, people talking about taking their country back. … There's a certain racial component to this for some people.' 'I don’t think this is the thing that is a main driver, but for some there's a racial animus,' Holder said. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, pictured here at a news conference this morning, claimed yesterday that some people dislike he and the president because of the color of their skin . Holder said the country is 'a fundamentally better place than we were 50 years ago' and has 'made a great deal of progress.' 'But there's still more we have to travel along this road so we get to the place that is consistent with our founding ideals,' he said. The first black Attorney General also stood by his 2009 comments that 'in things racial,' Americans 'have always been and continue to be, in too many ways, essentially a nation of cowards.' 'I wouldn't walk away from that speech,' Holder told ABC News' Pierre Thomas in an interview that aired on This Week. 'I think we are still a nation that is too afraid to confront racial issues,' he said, and to engage 'one another across the color line [to] talk about racial issues.' Portman said he agreed with Holder that America is a better place than it was before the Civil Rights Act passed in 1964, and 'I also agree with him there’s more work to be done.' The Republican Senator said he just couldn't get behind the Obama administration official's efforts to lump Americans who oppose the president's agenda in with racists, saying such rhetoric wasn't a 'constructive.' 'I don’t . think it takes us in the right direction in terms of making progress on . dealing with this eternal issue we’ve got in America, which is making . sure we are doing everything we possibly can do to fight racism,' he said.","Yesterday Attorney General Eric Holder said some of the 'vehemence' toward he and President Barack Obama is based on the color of their skin .

"A collection of impressive jewels worn by the Italian actress Gina Lollobrigida at the height of her fame smashed all estimates as it went under the hammer last night. Twenty three of the star's Bulgari gems, worn at landmark moments during her career, were sold at Sotheby's Geneva as part of the auction house's Magnificent Jewels and Noble Jewels sale. The biggest draw of the night was a pair of stunning diamond and pearl earrings from 1964, which broke the previous world record for a pair of pearl pendants when they sold to an anonymous bidder for an astonishing £1,567,771 ($2,391,321). The pearl earrings sold for more than five times their estimate as they went under the hammer last night . A . pair of natural pearl and diamond pendants dating from 1964 smashed . their estimate of  £400,000 ($600,000), netting nearly £1.6m when they . were sold to an anonymous bidder .

Lollobrigida said: 'Jewels are meant to give pleasure and for many years . I had enormous pleasure wearing mine.

What changed was . seeing a little girl called Sofia suffering from a disorder which could . only be helped by stem cell treatment – treatment which she is unable to . receive in Italy. 'Selling my jewels to help raise . awareness of stem cell therapy, which can cure so many illnesses, seems . to me a wonderful use to which to put them.

The emerald earrings and brooch she wears here were sold last night . The actress, known fondly in her heyday as La Lollo, was a great collector of fine jewellery. Some she bought for herself, some she was gifted by admirers - of which there were many. In an interview with Sotheby's magazine she said she adored the craftsmanship of each piece. 'I love the stones – the pearls and emeralds – because they are natural, the raw products of nature. 'Then there is the skill of the artist involved, the craftsmanship of turning these beautiful stones into works of art. Each one is like a sculpture.' Lollobrigida, who came from humble beginnings, rose to fame in the Fifties and Sixties and was one of the most popular actresses of the time, starring alongside Anthony Quinn n The Hunchback Of Notre Dame and Frank Sinatra in Never So Few. A contemporary of Marilyn Monroe, when the two actresses were introduced in the U.S., Monroe confessed that she was often referred to as 'the American Lollobrigida'. Today the multitalented actress, now 85, is a photojournalist and sculptor working out of her studio near Carrara, Italy.

"A New York City teacher got so frustrated with the rowdy students at the back of her classroom that she fantasized out loud about stabbing them. Investigators heard that Jacqueline Baffoni, 32, kept a knife for slicing fruit in her desk drawer. When her eighth-grade children wouldn't stop talking, Ms Baffoni said: 'I feel like stabbing some of these kids - I have a knife here.' The teacher had been warned just a day earlier that her probation period might not be extended at the Collaborative Academy of Science Technology and Language Arts on Manhattan's Lower East Side, and she was fired in June 2012. Exasperation: Jacqueline Baffoni (left) joked she would stab her eight-grade students with a fruit knife . The New York Post reported that Ms Baffoni made the comments during last school year. The incident came just after receiving written notification that the school was considering 'discontinuing' her probation. Another teacher at the school told the Office of the Special Commissioner of Investigation (SCI) that this warning 'might have prompted' Ms Baffoni's outburst. It is as yet unclear why her probation was under threat - Ms Baffoni had been teaching at the school since 2009, but lost her job before the investigation could take place in mid-October last year. A second student told the SCI that the teacher reacted to students' bad behavior by saying: 'I have a knife in this room, and I wish I could stab them!' Ms Baffoni sent an email to the Post defending herself from what she describes as 'false allegations' and 'slanderous rumors.' She claims she was highly dedicated to her students and that: 'I would never wish to cause harm to any of my children.' 'Slanderous rumors': Ms Baffoni describes the reports as 'false allegations' Indeed, Ms Baffoni had used the website Donors Choose to raise over $400 worth of books for her students. During these efforts she spoke proudly of her children, claiming: 'Many teachers may tell this tall tale, but I really do teach the best students in New York City!' Tracy Wu, a former flatmate of Ms Baffoni, who is also a teacher, told the Post that this outburst was most likely due to her friend just venting her exasperation. 'I can understand her saying something like that in the heat of the moment while being stressed out,' said Ms Wu. 'She is incredibly dedicated to her job and to her kids - probably more than she should be,' Wu added. 'For some of the kids’ birthdays, she holds barbecues... and she spends her own money on them. She really makes them feel like family.'","Jacqueline Baffoni, 32, kept a knife for slicing fruit in her desk drawer at Manhattan school .

"Google has been accused of turning a blind eye to child sex predators after it refused to sign up to an alert system that could stop paedophiles viewing vile images online. Search engine Bing, which is owned by Microsoft, announced on Saturday that it would automatically flash up warning messages on the screens of users who type in terms that could lead them to child abuse sites. The warnings, which experts say would deter half of paedophiles by reminding them that their criminal activity can be tracked, will also be used by Yahoo!. Google has refused to sign up to an alert system that could stop paedophiles viewing vile images online (file picture) But Google has infuriated child safety campaigners  and experts by refusing to take part, because it believes its own methods in tackling the problem are more effective. Earlier this year it emerged that Mark Bridger, who abducted and killed five-year-old April Jones in Powys, collected a ‘library’ of sickening images by searching for simple terms on Google and Bing. Stuart Hazell, who killed 12-year-old Tia Sharp from Croydon, also progressed from online child porn to murder. Microsoft’s warning system on Bing would be activated automatically when users type in terms that could lead them to child porn. Typing in the terms, chosen in consultation with the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop), will cause a notice to appear on screen, stating: ‘Warning! Child abuse material is illegal.’ It will also include a link to advice on how to seek counselling. Experts said the warnings, known as splash pages, would deter a huge number of offenders. John Carr, a leading government adviser on online child safety, said: ‘The splash pages will not stop determined paedophiles but while they are very dangerous, they are a small number.

Stuart Hazell (right), who killed 12-year-old Tia Sharp from Croydon, also progressed from online child porn to murder . ‘These messages will warn off a larger number of men who are interested in these pages and stop them in their tracks. ‘At the beginning an interest in these images starts off as a mild curiosity but they get drawn in and in some cases it can lead to rape and abuse. ‘These messages show them they are not anonymous. Half would be put off by this.’ Mr Carr said stopping these men at an early stage would also allow police to focus on more extreme offenders. ‘What Bing and Yahoo! are doing is brilliant. If they show it can be done effectively, it will be very difficult for Google to continue to refuse as well,’ he added. A spokesman for the Lucy Faithful Foundation, which works with child sex abuse victims and offenders, also said the warnings would deter many paedophiles. A Google spokesman said it was working with experts on ways to deter offenders. ‘We use purpose-built technology and work with child safety organisations to find, remove and report child abuse imagery, because we never want this material to appear in our search results,’ he added.","Bing has announced it would automatically flash up warning messages .

"A British poker champion was attacked in the early hours of this morning just hours after winning $10million in a Las Vegas tournament. Sam Trickett, 26, was leaving a club with a female friend when six men assaulted the pair. The former plumber, from Retford, Nottinghamshire, was left with a cut face and covered in bruises while his companion, Natasha Sandhu, was spat on. Nothing was believed to have been stolen. The incident came just hours after Mr Trickett, whose nickname is 'Tricky', was runner-up in the Big One For One Drop poker tournament in Sin City. Scroll down for video . Assaulted: British poker champion Sam Trickett posted this photo of his injuries after he was attacked in the early hours of this morning just hours after winning $10million in a Las Vegas tournament . He won $10.1million (£6.5million) for coming second after placing a stake of $1million (£640,000) to enter the contest, the highest entry fee in history. Mr Trickett was out celebrating his win when he was set upon by six strangers. He Tweeted last night: 'Was having a great day until 6 guys did this to me. Seriously WTF? Couldn't be more angry #cowards.' He added a short while later: 'Is this what happens if you're successful? Literally beat the s*** out of me and spit in Natasha's face all over nothing.' Miss Sandhu shed some more light on the situation, via her own Twitter account. She wrote: 'It wasn't a mugging or anything just over nothing. Sam is fine... gonna spend some quality time together now.' It is not known if the pair contacted police following the assault. High roller: Mr Trickett (centre left) celebrates winning one million euros at a poker tournament in Cannes last year . In his element: Mr Trickett was out celebrating his win when he was set upon by six strangers . The tournament was won by Iran-born Antonio Esfandiari, who took home $18.3million (£11.7million) in prize money. But a delighted Mr Trickett, speaking before the assault, said he planned to toast his $10.1million win with a few drinks. He wrote to his followers on Twitter: 'Thank you everyone for your support, you're all legends! Time to go drink until my organs hurt.' He added: 'The first thing I should do now is to call my mum and dad back home in England. The second I heard about the tournament my eyes lit up, and I knew I wanted to be in it.' Amazingly, Mr Trickett claimed he was 'angry' for not claiming the top prize due to taking a high-risk strategy during the final few hands of the tournament. His multi-million dollar win is a long way from his humble origins at Sheffield casinos in 2005. Two years later he won £3,500 before taking home £156,000 for finishing in fourth place at a World Series of Poker event in Las Vegas in 2008. Forty-eight players took part in the Big One For One Drop tournament, which started last Sunday before wrapping up yesterday.
