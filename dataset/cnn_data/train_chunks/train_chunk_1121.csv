"Wales captain Sam Warburton says a strong emphasis has been put on collective self-analysis by his players ahead of Sunday's RBS 6 Nations appointment with Scotland at Murrayfield. It is eight years since Wales were last toppled by the Scots, but they will head to Edinburgh following a confidence-shaking Millennium Stadium loss against England six days ago. Wales failed to score a point in the second half as England impressively wiped out a 16-8 interval deficit, leaving Warburton and company facing an uphill task during this season's Six Nations tournament. Sam Warburton (2nd right) leads the Wales players out for training ahead of the match against Scotland . The Wales captain faced the media on Wednesday ahead of their second Six Nations clash . Two years ago, Wales were beaten by Ireland in their opening game, but they recovered superbly to reel off four successive wins, culminating with a record 30-3 demolition of England. And Warburton's men face doing it the hard way again, with three of their next four games - Scotland, France and Italy - being away from home. 'We need to try and play a bit more rugby,' Warburton said. 'That is what we are about, and when we play well we get our key players in the game and get some go-forward. 'Teams are starting to play a little bit less rugby against us and it's how we can adapt to that. Wales take on Scotland at Murrayfield on Saturday, and haven't lost to the Scots for eight year . Warburton is looking for his side to respond following the disappointing defeat by England in opener . 'We have spoken about it as players, and if it happened again I think we would respond a lot better than we did last Friday. 'Everybody has had a really good look at their own game and how they can improve, whether it's contact area or a front-row forward at the scrum. 'I would never question the effort of anyone, but sometimes you have to think on the move and it's not down to the coaches. They are not on the field with us and we have to figure it out ourselves. Players will take responsibility for that. 'We went in at half-time after Dan Biggar's drop-goal and felt in control. 'Things were going to plan but in the second half England slowed up a lot of our ball, were effective at the tackle area, drove a lot of their lineouts and didn't give us too much possession. They got their tactics right and we didn't react to that.' Warburton's Wales were well beaten by Stuart Lancaster's side at the Millennium Stadium last Friday . England centre Jonathan Joseph scored the decisive try of the game as they got the better of Wales on Friday . Wales head coach Warren Gatland has made just one change for the Edinburgh trip, with Liam Williams replacing rested wing George North. And for the Wales forwards especially it represents a chance to redeem themselves, given how much domination England enjoyed up-front. Warburton added: 'We had a forwards meeting this week that was scheduled to be five to 10 minutes, but it went on quite a bit longer than that. 'It was good talking through our decision-making at certain lineouts, what our thought process was and what we could do to change things. 'A lot of players spoke up about their own roles and it's better than sitting down and having the coaches telling us X, Y, Z and what we should, or shouldn't, have done. The atmosphere at the Millennium Stadium was electrifying both before and during the contest . England head coach Stuart Lancaster has hailed his side's 21-16 win against Wales in the Six Nations . 'They let the players figure it out for ourselves because that is what we will have to do in a game. 'There was a lot said and it was a productive morning. We didn't do a lot of training but the amount of talking that we did will help us moving forward. 'It's always an arm-wrestle for quite a long time against Scotland and, looking at them now, their line speed is excellent in defence and it will be another big challenge for us. 'We need to get back to winning ways and it is must-win because if we want to win the championship we are going to have to win all four of our remaining games. 'One step at a time, but we have to win on Sunday.'","Wales take on Scotland at Murrayfield on Saturday in the Six Nations .

"Anthony Watson's Bath coach and mentor rang England's rising star after the against-the-odds victory over Wales in Cardiff to congratulate him on a try-scoring display that captured the nation's attention. Six years after having his breath taken away by the speed of the 14-year-old Watson's footwork, Neal Hatley was not surprised by his young charge's response. 'I phoned him after the game in Wales just to say, 'Well done on an unbelievable performance and your first try', and Ant replied, 'Yes, but I dropped one, didn't I?' He's always been like that, constantly striving for perfection.' Anthony Watson gets into the thick of the action during England's training session in Bagshot on Thursday . Watson fires out a pass at England's base in Pennyhill Park as England full back Mike Brown watches on . Watson as a child with his mother Viv and father Duncan, who played flanker for Saracens . Watson's performance, on only his fifth England appearance, in front of 78,000 fans and more than eight million watching on TV, was so assured it was hard to believe that here was a young man who sat his A-levels only two years ago. 'I remember the first time I saw him he was about 14, a tall but real skinny kid,' said Hatley, who first coached Watson at London Irish's academy before convincing him to follow him down the M4 to Bath in his late teens. 'His older brother Marcus was down for an academy session and Ant came with him. We did some footwork drills with the top 17 and 18-year-olds in the group. Ant left everybody for dead. I'd never seen anything like it before at that age. 'We had him down the next week and it's gone from there. First impressions of him were of a young man with unbelievable footwork and unbelievable ability. Nothing's changed in that regard: Ant could step you in a phone box. He's a special talent.' Neal Hatley coached Watson (above) at London Irish's academy before convincing him to join him at Bath . That footwork, allied to searing pace and a superb defensive work-rate, have seen Watson fast-tracked into Stuart Lancaster's squad after impressing all the way through England's age-group levels. A hugely gifted young sportsman who had trials for Chelsea as a 13-year-old and also excelled at St George's Weybridge School in cricket and hockey, Watson — who also has three A-levels at grades A, B and C — was inspired as a youngster by England's 2003 World Cup-winning wing Jason Robinson. 'When I was playing at Under 9 or 10 level, I was watching Jason Robinson a lot and trying to emulate him,' he said. 'I just tried to be like him as a kid and I've followed it up from there.' Being the middle brother of three, Anthony was driven by a fierce sibling rivalry which saw him constantly striving to better Marcus, now an England Sevens star, while his younger brother Callum, in his final year at St George's, tried to keep pace. Watson showed world class finishing skills to gather Brown's chip to touch down against Wales . 'All the boys played rugby on a Saturday and football on a Sunday,' said his dad Duncan, himself a former Saracens flanker whose career was ended by a ruptured knee ligament. 'I think that's helped them tremendously with being able to kick a ball. They all made a decision to focus on rugby when they were 12 or 13. 'They'd run around in the garden all the time. Marcus would go out in the garden and kick a ball and Anthony would join them. Callum would be running around with his little feet trying to catch them but failing. Even from a very young age people would say Anthony could go all the way.' Now 6ft 1in and weighing more than 15st, Watson has all the gifts to be a top-class international full back — where he normally plays for Bath — or wing. A Daily Mail Vase finalist with St George's, his talent was evident from a young age. 'He always had beautiful footwork,' said James Reynolds, St George's head of sport. 'He wasn't the biggest at junior school but he was certainly part of a strong year. The Under 9s won the national title in 2003, the year England won the World Cup. 'He was very jinky and would dance his way up the field. His ability to beat players was outstanding. He would do stuff that was different and wouldn't conform to being the textbook rugby player. You didn't want to over- coach him or suppress that free spirit. His sidestep was lethal.' Watson (right) beats Wales winger George North to a high ball at the Millennium Stadium . Watson's lavish talents came to the attention of Lancaster when he broke into the England schools set-up when the now national coach was running the RFU academy programme. 'If you watch him in training, his ability to understand the defensive system and make good decisions, whether to come up and make the tackle or to back off when he's outnumbered, is very impressive,' Lancaster said. 'His aerial skills are exceptional. Two or three times at the weekend it was a 50-50 and he came up with the ball every time. He's big, tall, athletic and obviously we've not really put him in too much space in the games and that's his point of difference. 'I think he could be exceptional for us.' In many ways Watson already has been exceptional. The way he scooped up Mike Brown's clever grubber kick down the right-hand touchline against Wales on Friday to kick-start England's revival bore the hallmarks of a world-class finisher. This week Bath's head coach Mike Ford, who first saw Watson's enormous potential playing alongside his son — current England fly-half George — for England schools four years ago, highlighted the 20-year-old's much-improved temperament following his work with sports psychologist Don Macpherson. Watson crosses for a try against Exeter during Bath's 31-14 win against the Chiefs in December . 'Anthony has learnt a lot from Don,' Ford said. 'Anthony's loving it. He said if he had played in this fixture last year he'd have been a nervous wreck, but on Friday he was full of confidence. He's got a great unpredictability about him, which is great to coach.' Watson concurs. 'I can't exaggerate how beneficial that has been,' he said. 'I think a lot of people neglect the mental side of rugby but I think it's paramount in allowing us to go out on the pitch on the Saturday and allowing us to perform. 'A year ago I would have been massively nervous going to the Millennium Stadium in that hostile environment and having to play. This time I struck that perfect balance between being calm and excited. 'I was confident that I'd done all the work required and I was ready to perform. As a player, I don't want to stagnate. I always want to get better.' On Saturday, at Twickenham, Watson will be striving for perfection again.","Anthony Watson won his fifth cap for England during this side's 21-16 victory against Wales at the Millennium Stadium .

"Brentford have confirmed that manager Mark Warburton will leave the club at the end of the season after an agreement was reached with owner Matthew Benham. Reports that Warburton's time at promotion pushing Brentford were numbered have been around since last week and the club have confirmed that the 52-year-old, along with sporting director Frank McParland and assistant manager David Weir, will all leave Griffin Park in the summer. Warburton replaced Uwe Rosler last season when the German moved to Wigan and guided them to promotion from League One. Mark Warburton will leave Brentford at the end of the season . Brentford players mobbed manager Warburton after Andre Gray's goal against Watford last week . Since promotion, Brentford have been one of the surprise packages in the Championship this season and have been pushing for the play-offs. But regardless if the Bees go up to the Premier League or remain in the Championship, Warburton will leave the club. Owner Benham has made the decision, which will be met with dismay by Brentford fans, following a disagreement over the long-term direction of the club. Benham said: 'I am a passionate Brentford fan and every decision I take is intended to be in the best long-term interests of the club. Brentford owner Matthew Benham has made the decision to replace Warburton in the summer . 'Some of the decisions taken to date have been easy and some, like this one, have been extremely hard. 'Under Mark's stewardship, Brentford have achieved a high league position and played football which is a joy to watch. 'It is difficult to seek to implement change, particularly when things appear to be going so well, but I am single minded in my resolve that we can leave no stone unturned in our quest for sustainable Premier League Football. 'Innovation, not increased funding, can be the only route to success for clubs such as ours, and I fully accept that innovation is never without risk. 'We are continuing to build a strong base for the future. 'Everything has been perfectly amicable between all parties and we remain friends.' Brentford lost 3-0 to Charlton at the weekend and slipped out of the play-off places . Warburton was appointed Bees manager in December 2013, moving from his previous role as sporting director, following  Rosler's departure. He led them to promotion five months later and their form in the Championship has been remarkable - they only slipped out of the top six for the first time this season following a 3-0 defeat at Charlton on Saturday. That setback came after reports emerged that Benham was planning to make the shock managerial change at the end of the campaign despite the almost unprecedented success the unfashionable west London club have been enjoying. It is understood Benham and Warburton clashed in January over the club's transfer policy, with the manager unwilling to bring in new faces which might have unsettled the current squad. Benham will now look to appoint a head coach, rather than a manager, who the club crucially say will 'have a strong input into the players brought into the club, but not an absolute veto'. Warburton confirmed there had been a disagreement over 'key philosophical differences' which could not be reconciled. But he added: 'In my remaining time at the club we shall move heaven and earth to get the promotion that the players, fans and Matthew deserve and going forward, I wish the club every success in its ongoing adventure. 'David and I, and indeed all the staff, remain totally focused on supporting this squad of players and ensuring they are best prepared for each and every remaining fixture this season.'","Brentford announce manager Mark Warburton will leave the club .

The same cannot be said, however, of Chelsea's driver, who failed to park the team bus while entering the Parc des Princes, ahead of the Blues' round of 16 Champions League tie with PSG. Failing to navigate a tight turn into the stadium's underground car park, the clumsy driver managed to get the bus wedged into the entrance, smashing a rear window in the process.

"Tragic: The fire at the animal rescue centre killed conservationist Rita Miljo as well as three baboons . An horrific blaze has destroyed a baboon rescue centre killing a renowned conservationist as well as three animals. Rita Miljo, who reintroduced packs of baboons into the wilds of South Africa, died in the fire which destroyed much of the headquarters of the sanctuary she built, an official said. Karl Pierce, a director with the sanctuary said the 81-year-old died in the small apartment she kept above the clinic of the Centre for Animal Rehabilitation and Education in the bush of Limpopo province. Also killed in the fire were three . baboons including Bobby, the first chacma baboon she rescued and nursed . back to health in 1980 after spiriting her away from a national park . without a permit, Mr Pierce said. The fire broke out around 8pm yesterday after volunteers and workers left the centre for the evening, he added. No . one else was injured in the blaze, which consumed the clinic, offices . and a house on the property, about 250 miles north east of Johannesburg. The cause of the fire is under investigation. While . Ms Miljo no longer ran day-to-day operations of the centre, which cares . for more than 400 baboons, she remained a constant presence and a . figurehead for the organisation she founded in 1989. 'Everybody's still in shock about this,' Mr Pierce said. Born in Germany in 1931, Ms Miljo arrived in South Africa in the 1950s. In a 2008 article about her in the Washington Post Magazine, she said helping baboons taught her 'why people behave the way they do'. 'Chimpanzees can be deceitful, just like humans, whereas baboons haven't learned that yet,' she said. 'So what you learn from the baboons is the truth about yourself. Rita Miljo was renowned for helping to reintroduced packs of baboons into the wilds of South Africa . Chimpanzees have already learned to find beautiful little excuses for their behaviour.' In South Africa, baboons have a troublesome reputation. In Cape Town, they are known for . raiding cars and frightening tourists. Baboons are a protected species . under South African legislation but their aggressive pursuits of food . have led to conflicts with residents. Ms Miljo nursed orphaned and injured . baboons back to health, then pioneered ways of reintroducing whole . troops of cared-for baboons back into the wild, her centre said. In 1994, the centre released 10 hand-reared baboons back into the wild. Rita Miljo nursed orphaned and injured baboons back to health, then pioneered ways of reintroducing whole troops of cared-for baboons back into the wild . A year later, seven had survived and integrated back into the wild population, the centre said, a success as many thought the cared-for baboons would not be able to adjust. Ms Miljo is survived by a brother who lives in Botswana, Mr Pierce said. Her first husband, Lothar Simon, and her 17-year-old daughter died in 1972 in a plane crash. Despite personal tragedies in her own life, she remained focused on her work to help sick and injured baboons. When asked in 2008 where the body of one of the baboons she sheltered would be buried, she offered a quick answer: 'I remember where each one is and that's where I'm going to be buried too.'","Rita Miljo, 81, dies after fire rips through Centre for Animal Rehabilitation and Education in the bush of Limpopo province ."

"President Barack Obama secretly met with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at the White House today, a White House official has confirmed. The lunch was not on the president's schedule and only became public knowledge after People magazine tweeted a photo of its Washington Bureau Chief, Sandra Westfall, standing next to Clinton with the caption: 'PEOPLE's @sswestfall chats w/@HillaryClinton before her mtg at the WH. Hope we didn't make her late for @BarackObama! Scroll down for video . People Magazine raised questions about how the president spent his day on Thursday after tweeting out this photo of it Washington Bureau Chief Sandra Westfall, left, and Hillary Clinton, right . People quickly deleted the tweet but not before reporters made copies of it. A White House official confirmed to the reporter assigned to cover the president today on behalf of the White House press pool that Obama did in fact have Clinton over to the West Wing today, but it was for a casual lunch, not a meeting, the official said. 'The President enjoyed an informal, private lunch with Secretary Clinton at the White House this afternoon,' the official reportedly told Roll Call reporter Steven Dennis. Obama's 'informal' luncheon with Clinton comes in the middle of a high-profile scandal involving the Veteran's Affairs Department. Yesterday, the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General released an interim report stating that 1,700 veterans at a VA hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, were systematically placed on secret waiting lists where they languished while waiting to see VA doctors. More than 40 veterans on the secret waiting lists died, according to a former doctor at the hospital. After looking into the retired physician's claims, the Office of Inspector General found that staff at the hospital claimed veterans were seeing doctors in a timely manner, when in reality many waited an average of 115 days for their first appointment. As a result of the preliminary report, VA hospitals across the country are now under scrutiny. President Obama has not publicly addressed the findings of the report, yet he had time to meet with Clinton today. The White House . official who confirmed the lunch did not say what the president and Clinton, a presumed 2016 . presidential candidate, discussed or how long they ate. It's possible the two nemeses talked about how the president should handle the VA scandal. A plethora of lawmakers have called on the president to either fire VA Secretary Eric Shinseki or for Shinseki to resign on his own accord. The former secretary of state and the president may also have discussed the president's decision to draw down forces in Afghanistan. President Obama nnounced yesterday that the U.S. would withdraw the bulk of its forces in Afghanistan by the end of of this year, leaving only 9,800 soldiers in the country, down from 32,000. This Nov. 28, 2012 file photo shows then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton listening as President Barack Obama speaks in the Cabinet Room at the White House in Washington . The midterm elections were likely a topic of discussion, as well. Republicans have a strong chance of reclaiming the Senate from the president's political party and making Obama a Lame Duck president during his final years in office. The GOP is likely to stay in command of the House of Representatives. Thus, winning the Senate is the president's last best hope to move forward his agenda during his second term. A Washington Post/ABC News poll released earlier this month found that Hillary Clinton had a significantly higher favorability rating than President Obama. Respondents to the poll gave Clinton a 53 percent approval rating. Only 41 percent said the same of Obama. Obama has been trekking the country trying to raise money for Democratic candidates in competitive races, but based on polling data, Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, would be move valuable advocates on the campaign trail than the sitting president. Today's incident is likely to bring back memories of the 2008 presidential race, when Clinton's campaign released an ad claiming then-Senator Hillary Clinton was betterr equipped than Obama to protect the nation in a crisis. In the infamous '3 am call' ad, Clinton's campaign asked who voters wanted answering the phone in the middle of the night when trouble came knocking at America's door. The ad never referenced Obama or Clinton, other than Clinton's required seal of approval at the end of the ad, but it was obvious who the ad was targeting.","President Barack Obama had former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton over for lunch today .

"the image below may look like a modern art sculpture but this jumble of metallic shapes is actually a bike frame in the making. The two British firms behind the innovative framework claim they have created the first 3D printed metal bike frame. Made of titanium alloy, the frame is fresh out of a 3D printer and has been designed to be as light and strong as possible - but the parts still need to be stuck together by hand. Made of titanium alloy, the frame (pictured) is fresh out of a 3D printer and has been designed to be as light and strong as possible - but the parts still need to be stuck together by hand to form a recognisable bicycle frame . The project is a collaboration between Renishaw – the UK’s only 3D printing manufacturer using metal parts - and bicycle design company Empire Cycles, in the north west of England. Based on Empire’s MX-6 mountain bike, the frame is printed in titanium alloy and has a tensile strength of over 900MPa. Based on Empire's MX-6 mountain bike, the frame is printed in titanium alloy and has a tensile strength of over 900MP. It is pictured as part of the Empire bike model . The frame was designed using topological optimisation, - software to distribute material in the smartest way possible (illustrated) The new frame is hollow with internal strengthening features and is a third lighter than the original. It was designed using ‘topological optimisation,’ which means using software to distribute material in the smartest way possible. ‘Material is removed from areas of low stress until a design optimised for load bearing is evolved,’ Renishaw said, so that unneeded material can be eliminated and the bike made lighter. The frame, which when printed is joined to a metal plate, was broken up and bonded together. The companies said this allows for flexible design improvements and the process means that a frame can be tailored to an individual’s exact needs. The bike is not yet on sale and is currently being put through its paces by researchers at Swansea University, who are using strain gauges to measure its performance both in the lab and on mountains. While in its infancy for metal bike frames, there could come a day when bicycle enthusiasts could easily print out their own frames and other parts to build a bespoke 3D printed bike. The new 3D printed frame is hollow with internal strengthening features and a third lighter than the original (pictured) made by Empire Cycles . The process was used to determine the most efficient use of titanium for the 3D printed bike frame. The word comes from the Greek word for place – topo - and topological optimisation software is the term given to programs that are used to determine the ‘logical place’ for material. It normally involves using iterative steps and element analysis. Material is removed from areas of low stress until a design optimised for load bearing is evolved. The resulting model is both light (due to the low volume of material used) and strong. The two firms worked together on the bike from to design a shape made for additive manufacturing - eliminating many of the downward facing surfaces that would otherwise have needed wasteful support structures.","British firms Renishaw and Empire cycles designed the titanium alloy frame based on Empire's MX-6 mountain bike .

"If there was one thing that caught our attention in the new episode of Made In Chelsea – besides a new character with quite possibly the world’s poshest name (yes you, Miffy) – it was Binky Felstead’s svelte new figure. As filming for season six of the E4 show loomed, the reality TV star decided it was time to shed the excess pounds she gained off-screen and pack herself off to bootcamp. And now we can reveal that, following a week-long rigorous diet and exercise plan, 5ft 7in Binky has slimmed down from 10st 10lbs to 9st 10lb and has celebrated her new figure in a sizzling set of swimwear images shot in Ibiza. New physique: Binky Felstead wanted to get in shape for the new series of Made In Chelsea so she hit bootcamp and lost a stone in a week . A resident of the notoriously hardcore No 1 Bootcamp in Ibiza, she was woken every morning at 6am by loud music, and set to work flipping tyres, doing circuits and beach workouts. Then she would have a specially-prepared breakfast before embarking on two-and-a-half-hour  sessions of cross, circuit and high intensity interval training. Her calories at the camp were limited to just over a thousand per day and each meal was a blend of slow release carbs, lean protein and essential fats. Military-style hikes of between seven to eight miles filled the majority of the afternoon to maximise fat burning. Before and after: Binky has slimmed down from 10st 10lbs to 9st 10lbs through a combination of a week of intense exercise and ditching boozy nights out and kebabs . Binky lost a stone and is so . confident about her new size 10 body that she says she wouldn’t rule out any . on-screen naked shower or bedroom scenes a la Louise Thompson. As she was: Once a mainstay on the Chelsea party scene, Binky now only goes out once a week and sticks to vodka lime and soda . Despite . feeling at her best, Binky’s ultimate goal is to reach a size 8 and we . can’t help but wonder if that’s got anything to do with the fact that . she has a new boyfriend. While she won’t confirm the identity of the lucky man (OK! magazine says she is rumoured to be dating co-star Alex Mytton), she blames her new relationship on eating more. Speaking to OK! Magazine, who shot the swimwear images, Binky said: ‘Having a boyfriend means I eat a lot bigger portions. 'I get really jealous if he’s got a bigger portion to me and if I’ve eaten everything on my plate I’ll always stick my fork on his plate!’. It seems that her past relationship, whereby her ex-boyfriend called her a ‘big whale’, has had a lasting effect. She said: ‘With my ex-boyfriend I put on a lot of weight because we were going out way too much and eating a lot of takeaways, it was bad. He used to call me the big whale and I didn’t know why. ‘I actually saw him recently and he . was like: ‘You look amazing, you’ve lost loads of weight!’ So I said to . him: “You should’ve told me how fat I was!” He was like: “I did by . calling you the big whale!” I always thought he was joking, but he . bloody wasn’t!’ Once a mainstay on the Chelsea party scene, Binky only goes out once a week and sticks to vodka lime and soda. She also tries her best to avoid carbs and 2am drunken kebab pit-stops. She has revealed that she curbs her cravings by taking diet pills, Forza Raspberry Ketones. Love is in the air? Fran and Alex admit to having met up over the summer, and share a quick kiss at the pool party, but OK! magazine say Binky is now rumoured to be dating the handsome newcomer (R) She's back!

"Made In Chelsea star Spencer Matthews shows off his recent weight loss in new topless pictures, which he achieved in just a week through intensive detox and workout at a boot camp. The Eton educated star has lost over a stone in total, losing 13lbs in the first three days alone. Spencer, 25, admits he looked at little flabby and out of shape in the 'before' picture taken on arrival in Ibiza, admitting he had 'let himself go' due to the recent turbulence in his love life. Scroll down for video . Spencer lost over a stone (but gained a tan!) in the course of just a week at the boot camp in Ibiza . Spencer dropped the pounds through intense exercise regimes, which he confesses he found hard, combined with a strict diet . The training, which combined cardio with strength training, lasted for 8 hours a day and was over seen by ex-military trainers to insure the intensity never dropped . The character we love to hate on the hit channel 4 reality show, Spencer ended his two year relationship with co-star Louise Thomas in the latest season. As well as seeing her move on with his friend Andy Jordan, Spencer had his emotions further bruised by being rather unceremoniously dumped by Lucy Watson who he had begun to date. He lost more than a stone in weight at No 1 Boot Camp, a diet and fitness retreat which co-star Binky also used to shed unwanted pounds. He says: 'You have to look good in my career and obviously I've been failing miserably in that recently. Spencer claims that his turbulent love life in the most recent season of Made in Chelsea had caused him to become 'beastly' The boot camp involved long walks and runs in the hills of Ibiza as part of the eight hours daily exercise . 'In recent episodes of Made In Chelsea I looked quite beastly, I'd let myself go. 'Being in a relationship for so long, you end up getting lazy, ordering pizzas. 'The . turbulence of falling in and out of love has made it difficult not to . go out a lot and when you're socialising you're drinking - and I've not . been thinking too much about my health and weight. 'There is absolutely no moderation in my life.' Spencer . got back in shape during a punishing week at No 1 Boot Camp where he . cut out the alcohol, ate very little and trained intensively for eight . hours a day. The camp is based in a villa situated in the north-west of the island near to the tranquil resort of Santa Eulalia. The change in his body is obvious, but he admits the process behind this achievement was not easy . Spencer explains: 'It was amazing. The boot camp trainers had me up at the crack of dawn doing punishing work-outs and then in the afternoon we would do four-hour hikes up the hills and coastline of Ibiza. 'It was beautiful and also very tiring, but the end result was great. 'I lost just over a stone in a week. In fact, I lost 13lbs in three days! 'We trained very, very hard and ate very little - it was a brilliant kick-start to get myself back to fitness.' The . camp uses ex-military trainers to really keep the guests motivated, . combined with a diet of low-fat food cooked by Michelin-starred chefs. The stunning surroundings and weather must have made the harsh workouts and diet a little easier . Spencer says he is pleased with the results of the week and the changes to his body, but claims there is room for improvement and he will repeat the boot camp soon . Spencer  - now happily settled with his 22-year-old Made In Chelsea co-star Lucy Watson again - admits that when he starts exercising it quickly becomes an addiction. He says: 'There is absolutely no moderation in my life, I'm afraid, but the only real addiction I get is going to the gym. Spencer booked for a week after his Made In Chelsea co-star Binky Felstead,22, lost a stone at the  camp's sister site on the North Norfolk coast. Spencer is delighted with his results in his appearance, saying: 'My jawline has started to reappear!' He is enjoying life with his latest . love interest Lucy - and has no regrets about the bitter split with . co-star, 22-year-old Louise. He . says: 'What I learnt from my last relationship is that if you want to . sleep with other people, you should end things because it's not going . anywhere. I should have split with Louise six months ago.' And Spencer isn't finished with his make-over, insisting he can look better. 'I'm . going back to No 1 Boot Camp when we finish the filming of this series . of Made In Chelsea. I need to finish the job and get seriously ripped!' he says. Spencer blames the turbulent nature of the last season for his weight gain .

"The great Malky Mackay gamble might be on its last legs, but the final breath of air hasn't been sucked out just yet. Owner Dave Whelan is back from his annual Caribbean winter cruise on Friday, furious with a scandalously poor run of results to have plunged the Latics deep into the relegation mire. The pensioner does not want this potential relegation to be his legacy and is considering sacking Mackay for the good of their future.

Subs not used: Carson, Flores, Bong, Robles . Booked: Pearce, Herd, Clarke, Ojo, Maguire, Kim Bo-kyung . Scorers: Pearce 17 . Referee: Simon Hooper . Attendance: 14,601 . That consideration will need to be tempered in the coming days, however, after debutant Jason Pearce's 17th-minute poke against a hapless Reading was enough to secure the manager's second win of a dismal three-month spell. They still look devoid of ideas going forward, a little shaky in possession, but the way in which the 2013 FA Cup winners battled here suggests they have the stomach to escape from this. 'It's a brand new group over the last three weeks,' Mackay said. 'It closes the gap. There are a lot of points to play for. It's about personality and character and we're beginning to show that. 'We lost Liam Ridgewell back to Portland Timbers and this is a brand new central defensive partnership with Harry Maguire and Pearce standing firm.' Wigan are a club still in a post-Roberto Martinez state of confusion, aware of their alarming slide but using just blindfolds, tails and donkeys in trying to fix it. The appointments of Owen Coyle and Uwe Rosler proved flawed; so too does the reasoning behind luring Mackay - then still under investigation by the FA for abusive text messages sent as manager of Cardiff City. Pearce holds off pressure from Reading forward Pavel Pogrebnyak during his side's 1-0 win . Reading's Danny Williams and Wigan Athletic's William Kvist tussle for the ball . It's so far been an unmitigated disaster - Whelan has even been banned from 'footballing activities' himself for defending the Scot - but everyone around the DW Stadium will be buoyed by grit and steel on display at the Madejski. However turgid the affair is irrelevant at this stage. The winner came with more than its fair share of good fortune, goalkeeper Adam Federici inexplicably fumbling Leon Clarke's tame header inside the six-yard box for Pearce to prod home. It was only their second goal in five games and that the ball went beyond the embarrassed Australian was the only thing to matter. Malky Mackay has been in charge of Wigan since November 2014 when he replaced Uwe Rosler . From there Wigan relaxed somewhat and, but for a trio of missed chances by Reading's loanee Nathaniel Chalobah, looked the more threatening - particularly when James McClean was given time to stretch his legs on the counter. Clarke was unsurprisingly apoplectic. 'Rubbish. I've no idea why,' he said. 'I've got to look long and hard at it. I need a different way of playing at home. 'It's very frustrating. To be honest tonight was a little bit embarrassing; it was so poor. If you see us here it's a team who's going to be fighting relegation. 'I don't think they spent any money on the pitch in the summer because of the money situation.' Mackay had barked relentlessly, fidgeting on the touchline like a man whose career is reliant on this sorry mess correcting itself. The deep exhales told the whole story - a few more nights like these wouldn't go amiss, although he could've done without the needless 11 minutes of additional time.

"Darren Bent's late equaliser rescued Derby from a shock defeat at Rotherham and kept them on course for promotion. It was a night in which Derby’s loan signings from Barclays Premier League sides proved their worth as Bent - on loan from Aston Villa - netted along with Hull’s Tom Ince scoring twice for the visitors. Rotherham will see this as a missed opportunity having been in front twice during the game. Darren Bent celebrates after scoring the equaliser for Derby in their 3-3 draw at Rotherham . Tom Ince scored twice for the promotion hopefuls Derby as they survived a major scare . Rotherham's Paul Green  opens the scoring in the 35th minutes for the Millers .

But they couldn’t hold on and goals from Ince and Bent earned Steve McClaren’s side a point which keeps them in the automatic promotion places. After a being knocked out of the FA Cup by Reading on Saturday, Derby were aiming to focus their attentions on reaching the top-flight. But on the just after the half-hour Green, a former Derby player, punished their uncertainty against high crosses to put the hosts in front after Kirk Broadfoot had headed on Ben Pringle’s cross. The lead lasted 60 seconds as Ince conjured an instant reply out of nothing. The midfielder turned at one corner of the Rotherham area to fire left footed inside Adam Collin’s far post. Derby should have been ahead, though, despite escaping when Danny Ward put an early header straight at Derby goalkeeper Lee Grant. Derby’s Jamie Ward wasted two chances but did draw attention to an injury to Jack Hunt, who fell writhing at his feet. Richie Smallwood celebrates netting the second goal for Rotherham with Paul Green and Zeki Fryers . Within five minutes Matt Derbyshire struck again for Rotherham as they took a 3-1 lead . Ince races back for a quick restart for Derby after netting his second goal of the night for 2-3 . Hunt, on loan from Crystal Palace, was stretchered off with a bad gash suffered in a collision with team mate Smallwood as both went for the ball. Smallwood made a more desirable impact just after the break, curling in a stunning free-kick from wide on the left. Then Derbyshire was played clear to finish coolly for his fourth goal in five games. McClaren seemed to be missed the injured Chris Martin, who has 19 goals this season. But Ince kept Derby in it with another adroit finish for his fifth goal for the club he joined in January.

"The Duchess of Cambridge's brother has been forced to turn to his family for financial help after his cake business made a loss of £17,000 last year. James Middleton's family have secured an overdraft after the loss made by his company Nice Group, which sells bread, cakes, flour and sugar confectionery, was revealed in new figures.

Debt: Nice Group, the business of James Middleton, left, brother of the Duchess of Cambridge, right, made losses of £17,000 in its first year . His parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, run the hugely successful Party Pieces website which has earned the family millions. But the midas touch has not so far been passed down to son James, 25. The accounts, signed by Mr Middleton, show the company has stocks of £3,320 and is owed £5,151 by debtors. But the amount owed to creditors mean the firm is in debt in its first full year of trading to April 30, 2012. Disappointing sales: Pippa Middleton, left, at the launch of her book Celebrate, right, in London late last year .

Mr Middleton also runs Nice Cakes Ltd and Nice Wine Ltd, which has filed dormant accounts. The businessman caused a stir and embarrassed the royal family when a range of 'rude' products were launched last year. They included a cake called a Stud Muffin featuring a picture of a man with the caption: 'A willy that wriggles and gives me the giggles.' James Middleton told MailOnline: 'Nice Group is a start-up company and as you can imagine there are overheads needed to start a company.

"Tommy Smith's 83rd-minute goal was enough to earn Ipswich the points in a closely-fought 1-0 win over Watford. The two sides were evenly matched, both enjoying chances before the Town centre-back hammered in from close range after a well-worked free-kick from the home side. Victory moved the Tractor Boys up to fourth in the Championship and above Watford, who lie one place and one point behind their conquerors. Tommy Smith (centre) celebrates with his Ipswich team-mates after scoring the winner over Watford . Millwall defender Danny Shittu scored at either end as Brentford continued their  play-off push with a 3-2 victory over the Lions. Andre Grey scored either side of half-time to put the Bees 2-0 up, before Shittu and Alan Dunne scored twice in two minutes just before the hour mark to draw Millwall level. And Shittu then found just a few minutes later to give Brentford the win. Leeds arrested an eight-game winless run and Neil Redfearn tasted his first victory as permanent head coach as Blackpool were beaten 3-1 at Elland Road. United had not picked up three points since Redfearn’s successful caretaker spell in September, with the subsequent poor form under Darko Milanic leading to the former academy director getting the job full-time last week. His first two games yielded a point but the slump was halted against the league’s bottom side, with Liam Cooper, Souleymane Doukara and Mirco Antenucci all doing the damage by half-time. Fulham climbed out of the bottom three with a 3-1 victory over Huddersfield as they continued their revival under Kit Symons.

"Former Scotland captain David Weir - who was in the last Scotland team to face England on Scottish soil, in November 1999 - insists that England remain a force to be reckoned with on the international stage, despite Roy Hodgson’s men being a national embarrassment at the World Cup. Weir played in both legs of the Euro 2000 qualifying play-off 15 years ago. In the first leg at Hampden, two goals from Paul Scholes put England 2-0 up. Scotland then shocked England at Wembley, winning 1-0, a deserved victory but not enough for progress. The fortunes of both international sides have dipped since then. Scotland have not been to any major finals since the France ’98 World Cup. England have reached the quarter-finals at World Cups and Euros but the limp winless exit from Brazil showed how low their stock has fallen. Raheem Sterling, in action against Slovenia, is just one of the talents England can boast, says Weir . Wayne Rooney is England's finest player in a generation, according to the former Scotland captain . But Weir insists England have a crop of players many nations envy - and they will come good in time. ‘Daniel Sturridge, Raheem Sterling, Danny Welbeck, Jack Wilshere, Ross Barkley - these are talents any country in the world would be interested in,’ he says. ‘It’s a bit of myth that there is little or no talent there. There is. It’s a matter of letting it come to fruition. ‘Pick a team, stand by it, give it a chance to bond and have faith instead of chopping and changing after a couple of bad games. ‘And then there’s Wayne Rooney, who is the best player England have had in a generation.’ Weir know the young Rooney when they both played for Everton. ‘At 15 years old, he was confident, sure of himself, a nice guy, worked hard, trained hard, loved football,’ Weir says. ‘He’s the same now. He’ll play anywhere, he’s got great qualities as a player.’ Weir was a 29-year-old centre-half in his first full season at Everton when Scotland lost the play-off double-header in 1999. He is now the 44-year-old assistant manager at Championship Brentford, having played in a European final and won silverware at Rangers and been Sheffield United manager in between. Weir tackles England striker Michael Owen on the way to losing 2-0 with Scotland at Hampden Park in 1999 . Weir is now assistant manager at Championship side Brentford having managed Sheffield United . He has seen Scotland’s fortunes dwindle over the past 15 years, although he believes they may have turned a corner, and he has seen England’s dwindle too, although insists England have not fallen as far as many perceive. And as the pair prepare to face each other at Celtic Park in tonight’s friendly, he thinks the way in which the respective domestic leagues have become tougher to crack for home-grown players may be one reason their national sides have faltered. ‘The level in the Premier League certainly got higher, and it got harder for [British] players to get games,’ he says. ‘It got harder in the Scottish Premier League too. I’m not sure the level got higher there but it got harder for a young Scottish player to get a game because there were more foreign players, and bigger money to foreign players. ‘Looking back now that didn’t necessarily help Scotland in the long term.’ Paul Scholes leaps to head in his second goal as England beat Scotland 2-0 in the Euro 2000 play-off . The Hampden leg in 1999 was ‘an occasion of huge magnitude’, Weir says. ‘Scotland at the time were used to qualifying for major championships. We’d been at Euro 96 and the World Cup in 1998 so were expecting to go to the Euros again in 2000. So it was massive pair of games and one we thought we had a chance in.’ England’s XI still was still formidable enough that many rival nations would have coveted the spine: David Seaman, Tony Adams, Paul Ince, Scholes, Alan Shearer. David Beckham was on the wing. Michael Owen partnered Shearer. It was the day before Scholes’s 25th birthday and he scored his first goal in the 21st minute from a cross by Sol Cambell on the right, chesting down in the ‘D’, running on and lashing home right-foot from the edge of the six-yard box. England manager Kevin Keegan jumped in joy, arms aloft, as he did when Scholes got his second, this time from a Beckham cross, a header converted six yards out. Alan Shearer, David Seaman, Phil Neville, Sol Campbell, David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Jamie Redknapp and Michael Owen line up for England at Hampden with the spine of a team most nations would have coveted . ‘A bit of quality,’ recalls Weir, summing up the difference in the sides back then. ‘A massive atmosphere went from being very big to very quiet, very quickly.’ Scotland’s captain was Colin Hendry, and alongside Weir were seasoned Scottish players with big-tournament experience - Dodds, Burley, Gallacher, Hutchison, Collins. The manager was Craig Brown. ‘He said after we lost the first leg we still had a chance at Wembley,’ Weir recalls. Scotland famously won, Don Hutchison scoring and Christian Dailly almost making it two. Weir says Scotland have the ability for another upset today. ‘I think we’re competitive again now,’ he says. Weir thinks the ‘friendly’ nature of the match will favour Scotland. ‘[In competitive games] maybe Scotland are a bit more emotional and caught up in the atmosphere rather than clinical and executing a plan,’ he says. ‘Being a friendly will maybe relax things a bit, let them play with freedom and not get caught up in the emotion.’ Not like 15 years ago.","Former Scotland captain insists England remain a force on the world stage .

"Danny Cipriani has turned his back on a lucrative move to European champions Toulon to sign a new contract with Sale, following his try-scoring comeback for England on Saturday. The 27-year-old fly-half made his first Test appearance at Twickenham since 2008, as a replacement in the 47-17 RBS 6 Nations victory over Italy. His eye-catching cameo was further evidence that he has forced his way back into Stuart Lancaster’s plans - and that was undoubtedly a major factor in the decision about his club career. Danny Cipriani, who made a try-scoring cameo off the bench for England on Saturday, will stay at Sale . The 27-year-old fly half has been made offers by European champions Toulon but is settled in Manchester . Cipriani, here training with England, features in Stuart Lancaster's plans beyond this year's World Cup . The faith placed in him by Lancaster for a national team recall undoubtedly influenced his club decision . Cipriani joined Sale from Melbourne Rebels in 2012 and he has produced consistently outstanding displays for the Cheshire club over the last 18 months. Now, he has opted to stick with the Sharks for another two seasons, and Sportsmail understands that he will also take on the role of vice-captain. Toulon had made informal enquiries about Cipriani and they came back with a firm offer late last month. But after being called into the England squad, he chose to reject the offer in order to stay at home and in contention for Test selection.

While Harlequins and ambitious Bristol are understood to have expressed an interest, Cipriani has settled in Manchester and was happy to stay with Sale. Negotiations have dragged on for several months, but terms have been formally agreed this week. Having seen Toby Flood move to Toulouse at the end of last season, England head coach Lancaster will be relieved that another No 10 contender is not heading into Test exile across the Channel.

"Camp Bastion, the once sprawling British base in Afghanistan where the war against the Taliban was waged, is due to close today – eight years after the first UK troops pitched their tents in the Helmand desert. Following the deaths of 453 British personnel and an outlay of well-over £20 billion, Britain's largest operational base built anywhere since the Second World War will be handed over to Afghan troops. It comes as Britain prepares to withdraw entirely from the country by the end of this year. By next month more British troops will be deployed against the Ebola virus than in Afghanistan. Camp Bastion, the once sprawling British base in Afghanistan where the war against the Taliban was waged, is due to close today – eight years after the first UK troops pitched their tends in the Helmand desert . Prime Minister David Cameron addresses British troops at the base on October 3 this year; Britain is preparing to withdraw entirely from Afghanistan by the end of this year . Bastion has been the centre of British operations in the country since UK troops were sent to Helmand in 2006. The vast majority of the tens of thousands of British fighters who served in 'Task Force Helmand' since then, have passed through the camp. The base was initially constructed as an airfield, but grew to the size of Reading. At its peak, it had a temporary Pizza Hut, a well-equipped gym and a bar called Heroes, which only served alcohol-free beer. The base's runway, at one point the fifth busiest UK-operated airstrip, is expected to handle commercial flights. In 2006, the Government said UK forces would be there only to protect reconstruction, but they quickly got caught up in the struggle against the Taliban insurgency. A ceremony marking the departure of the last 1,500 UK troops from Camp Bastion is due to take place this morning. Subject to security arrangements, these soldiers will then be driven to a U.S. airbase over the next couple of days. The ceremony, which will include the lowering of the Union Jack, will be attended by the senior British officer in southern Afghanistan, Brigadier Robert Thomson, the second in command of the U.S-led Regional Command (South West). The base was initially constructed as an airfield, but grew to become the largest military camp Britain has built overseas since the Second World War and at its peak, it had a temporary Pizza Hut, a well-equipped gym and a bar called Heroes, which only served alcohol-free beer . Bastion has been the centre of British operations in the country since UK troops were sent to Helmand in 2006 - the vast majority of the tens of thousands of British fighters who served in 'Task Force Helmand' since then, have passed through the camp . Over the last year, 3,400 pieces of military hardware have been shipped or flown back to the UK. Anything not coming back has been destroyed so it cannot be used by the Taliban who are still believed to control huge swathes of Helmand. It is expected that all British combat troops will fly home from southern Afghanistan before Christmas. Following the end of the combat mission in December, around 400 British servicemen and women will stay on in non-combat roles, assisting with training programmes. A memorial wall at the camp bearing the name of every Briton who fell in Afghanistan has been dismantled and is to be displayed at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire. The camps location has meant that it was largely protected from Taliban attacks, but in September 2012, 15 insurgents disguised in U.S. uniforms opened fire at the camp. The attack, which took place while Prince Harry was stationed there, left two U.S. marines dead and a dozen injured. Mohammad Naeem, the governor of Helmand, has reportedly said that the takeover of the base by his forces can go ahead because they are now able to control the province without foreign help. The camp was attacked by Taliban fighters in 2012, while Prince Harry was stationed there, and resulted in the deaths of two U.S. marines; a dozen other personnel were also injured . One battalion of troops, believed to be Americans, are expected to be the only foreign forces to remain.Taliban operations to reclaim towns such as Sangin and Nowzad, once held by British forces, have inflicted heavy casualties on Afghan forces this year. Chief of the General Staff General Sir Nick Carter has said that security there remains 'difficult'. He has reportedly said that the handover of Camp Bastion would be significant 'not least because of the sacrifice that so many people have made in Helmand'. Mr Carter said he expected 'challenges' but was confident that the majority of the population in central Helmand will be secured by Afghan forces. At the peak of the Afghan conflict there were 10,000 British personnel in Helmand together with 20,000 US Marines, Danes, Estonians and other nationalities at 180 bases and checkpoints. The Ministry of Defence declined to comment on when Camp Bastion would be handed over.","The camp has been the centre of UK operations in Afghanistan since 2006 .

"Defence chiefs have attempted to block the production of a new film about the death of a British soldier in Afghanistan – because it portrays how the RAF botched a rescue mission. Corporal Mark Wright died in September 2006 after becoming stranded in an unmarked minefield during a mission against Taliban fighters near the strategically important Kajaki Dam in Helmand province. But tragedy struck when a Chinook helicopter sent to rescue Cpl Wright and other British soldiers set off mines in the area as it attempted to land, causing him fatal injuries and injuring others. Corporal Mark Wright died in 2006 after becoming stranded in an unmarked minefield during a mission against Taliban fighters . The Ministry of Defence was heavily criticised at the inquest into Cpl Wright’s death in 2009, with the coroner saying officials should ‘hang their heads in shame’ over the failure to send a properly equipped aircraft. Now the incident has been depicted in a new film, Kajaki: A True Story, which will be released next month. The movie, which stars Game Of Thrones actor Mark Stanley as a medic who tries to save Cpl Wright, is backed by Help For Heroes and other military charities which will receive a percentage of the box office takings. But the makers have told The Mail on Sunday that they were blocked in their attempts to research key parts of the story, because MoD officials refused permission to speak to any of the air crew involved. Cpl Wright, 27 took command when two paratroopers at the front of a patrol were blown up by mines. He sent a radio request for a helicopter equipped with a winch to lift the wounded to safety. Cpl Wright also warned the helicopter should not attempt to land in case the downdraught from its engines caused more explosions, the inquest said. But this instruction was ignored and instead a Chinook without a winch was sent, which led directly to his death and to more paratroopers being wounded. Producers from Pukka Films wanted to understand every aspect of the incident, including why the Chinook crew seemingly ignored Cpl Wright’s attempts to wave it away. Last night, Defence sources confirmed the MoD turned down repeated requests to speak to officers aboard the helicopter that day. Survivors: Stuart Hale (right) was on the minefield with Cpl Wright when disaster struck. He is pictured with colleague Hugh Keir at Camp Bastion . The film is poised to shock cinema audiences with its retelling of how Cpl Wright and his fellow paratroopers were let down by military officials. Disabled troops who recently competed in the Invictus Games – a sporting festival set up by Prince Harry – are expected to attend the premiere on November 12. They will meet Cpl Wright’s parents, who are fully behind the movie even though they admit they may find some of the scenes too shocking to watch. Last night, the soldier’s father Bob Wright, 67, from Edinburgh, said he hoped makers had got over obstacles put in their path by Defence officials. ‘They weren’t trying to bring the MoD down in any way, they’re just trying to show the bravery of the guys,’ he said. ‘We’re excited and nervous. I’m not going to watch the whole film, but I may go in for the start. If it gets too heavy I’ll come out.’ The Mail on Sunday was given an exclusive preview of the film which portrays the events of September 6, 2006. On that day, Cpl Wright and colleagues from the 3rd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment (3 Para) became trapped in a minefield which was not marked on their maps. With his colleagues L/Cpl Stuart Hale and Sgt Stuart Pearson lying in agony after being blown up, Cpl Wright, played by David Elliot, sends an emergency radio message requesting a helicopter should be dispatched to lift them out of the minefield. But UK commanders tell Cpl Wright no British helicopters fitted with the necessary equipment are available. Instead, they suggest he should move the casualties to an area where it would be safe for the Chinook to land. As the soldier explains, this is not an option due to the number of mines. The film then recreates the tragic moment when a twin-rotor Chinook hovers over Cpl Wright, the wounded paratroopers and the medic, Cpl Paul ‘Tug’ Hartley. The Chinook produces powerful blasts of air and – just as Cpl Wright had warned – more mines explode. As the dust settles, Wright is seen lying on the ground, his gaping wounds and charred face providing a harrowing reminder of the reality of war. Gasping for breath and in excruciating pain, he continues to issue orders to his colleagues, six of whom are now wounded. He insists they should not allow themselves to sleep because this will accelerate their physical decline. ‘No snoozing boys, OK?’ he croaks. It takes commanders six hours to send US Black Hawk helicopters fitted with winches to rescue the casualties. In the film, this period is boiled down to a harrowing 45 minutes as Wright and his colleagues desperately fight their injuries. A tear-jerking scene based on the testimony of survivors of the incident sees Cpl Wright tell ‘Tug’ Hartley he can feel himself getting colder. Fearing the onset of death, he issues a series of requests about his fiancee Gill Urquhart and family, which make for gripping viewing: . ‘Tell Gill I love her. Tell her to marry someone else and to be happy. Tell my parents to have a big party with a cash-free bar. Tell them I was a good soldier, tell them I died like a good Para.’ Desperately, Hartley seeks to reassure Cpl Wright that he will pull through, but by the time the US helicopters arrive he is only just clinging to life. In a selfless gesture typical of Cpl Wright, one of his last actions is to offer words of support to a casualty who is in a much better state than himself. Wright dies moments later. At the time of his death, he was preparing to marry Ms Urquhart, his fiancee of nine years. She has followed the wishes of her former partner and has since married and is now a mother of two children. For his actions that day, Cpl Wright was awarded a posthumous George Cross, the UK’s highest award for bravery not in the face of the enemy. Sgt Pearson was awarded the Queen’s Gallantry Medal and Tug Hartley the George Medal. At an inquest held into the causes of Cpl Wright’s death, coroner Andrew Walker made a withering attack on the MoD. The inquest heard the helicopter did set off the mine which killed Cpl Wright while the coroner highlighted three factors which caused his death – the downdraught from the Chinook, the lack of appropriate British helicopters fitted with winches, and the delay in sending a suitable helicopter. Other criticisms included the failure of the officer responsible for passing updated information about the mine threat being unable to interpret the maps, and that local knowledge had been ignored. Cpl Wright’s death also led to the RAF fitting Chinook helicopters with winches. A MoD spokesman said last night: ‘It is untrue to suggest the MoD has withdrawn its support or attempted to block the Kajaki film in any way. We agreed to provide a specific amount of support to this project and we honoured that agreement.’","Corporal Mark Wright died in an unmarked minefield in Afghanistan in 2006 .

"When 23-year-old Rhonda Kristen Casto fell to her death on a hike with her boyfriend six years ago authorities ruled it a tragic accident caused by slippery conditions on the steep trail. The young Portland, Oregon mother's case was reopened last week however, when Casto's then-boyfriend Stephen Wagner Nichols, 40, was arrested at San Francisco International Airport and charged with her murder. Nichols did not appear to be a suspect in his 9-years-younger girlfriend's death when her lifeless body was found at the bottom of an 100-foot embankment on March 16, 2009. Scroll down for video . Killer boyfriend? Stephen Wagner Nichols, now 40 (left), was arrested at the San Francisco Airport on February 12 in connection to the 2009 death of his then-girlfriend Rhonda Kristen Casto, 23 (right). Casto's falling death during a hike was ruled accidental at the time . The victim's mother told FOX 12 at the time that Casto was mother to a young daughter. 'I think about her last moments, and what she was thinking when she fell,' Casto's mother said in March 2009. 'How she's not going to get to see her daughter take her first steps. And how I'm never going to get to see my daughter again.' Not many details were released about Casto's death at the time, other than that a 'male companion' (now identified as Nichols), called 911 around 6pm to say she had fallen off a ledge while they were hiking the Eagle Creek Trail, about 45 minutes east of Portland. The popular hiking destination has been the scene of other accidents in the past, due to a few narrow sections that drop off on one side into a ravine. The trail was even more dangerous that day due to a battering of sleet and hail that made the trail slippery. Consequences: If convicted, Nichols could face 25 years to life in prison for Casto's (pictured) murder . Heartbreaking: Family members say Casto left behind a young daughter, and confirmed that she was dating Nichols at the time of her death . Narrow: At the time, Casto's death was ruled accidental. It was then believed that she slipped of the trail. Pictures of the Eagle Creek Trail show how narrow it becomes at points . Casto was one of four hikers who either fell to their death or died of exposure on Columbia River Gorge trails like Eagle Creek that year. 'The trail is very steep and narrow there, and it's been pretty wet and slippery,' Hood River County sheriff's Deputy Matt English told The Oregonian in 2009. 'There was still snow on the ground down near the parking lot.' It's currently unclear why Casto's case was reopened, and the cause of death switched to homicide. However, authorities say that a grand jury was assembled last April and that they filed a secret indictment for Nichols' arrest on one count of  murder. He was arrested February 12 at the San Francisco Airport. It's unclear if the Bend, Oregon man was doing at the airport. Nichols is currently being held without bail, after being arraigned in Hood River Court on Friday. he  faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted. His next court appearance is scheduled for March 3 at 11am.","Rhonda Kristen Casto, 23, was hiking with her boyfriend Stephen Wagner Nichols, now aged 40, when she fell to her death on March 16, 2009 .

"Craters from a double asteroid strike, described as 'one of the largest cosmic catastrophes' in the history of the solar system, have been uncovered in Sweden. The rare event took place around 458 million years ago, as a result of a mighty collision in the asteroid belt around 12 million years earlier. Nasa claims that if an asteroid was found to be on a collision course with Earth, there is a 15 per cent chance that it will be accompanied by a partner. Craters from a double asteroid strike, described as 'one of the largest cosmic catastrophes' in the history of the solar system, have been uncovered in Sweden. A team, led by Jens Ormoe of the Centre for Astrobiology in Madrid, Spain, carried out drilling into the craters, looking for traces of sediment altered by impact shock . The ancient smash-up occurred after a 120-mile (200km) asteroid broke up, scattering large chunks of rock, which later crossed Earth's orbit. Two of these pieces slammed into shallow seas that covered modern-day Scandinavia, according to the study. With uplift of the Earth's crust, the signature of that event lies in central Sweden - the 4.7 mile (7.5km) Lockne crater, located around 12.4 miles (20 km) south of the city of Oestersund, and a 0.4 miles (700 metre) crater at nearby Malingen. The study, published in the journal Scientific Reports, backs long-standing suspicions that these craters, just 9.9 miles (16 km) apart, were caused by a 'doublet', an extremely rare double whammy caused by asteroids travelling in pairs. If an asteroid was found to be heading for Earth, there is a 15 per cent chance it will be come as a pair. However, few impact 'doublet craters on Earth have been found. Pictured is an artist's impression of a doublet . It is thought that nearly 15 per cent of all asteroids travel in pairs, yet very few impact craters on Earth have been found as 'doublets'. Asteroids can hit Earth in pairs - or what scientists describe as 'doublets'. These double asteroids are thought to form when a 'rubble pile' asteroid begins to spin rapidly under the influence of sunlight. This causes the loose rock to be thrown out from the object's equator to form a small moon. It is thought that nearly 15 per cent of all asteroids travel in pairs, but very few impact craters on Earth have been found as 'doublets'. Only a small fraction of the binaries that hit the Earth will have the required separation between the asteroid and its moon to produce different craters. As well as Sweden, double impact craters have been found in Clearwater East and West in Quebec, Canada; Kamensk and Gusev in southern Russia; and Ries and Stenheim in southern Germany. The team, led by Jens Ormoe of the Centre for Astrobiology in Madrid, Spain, carried out drilling into the craters, looking for traces of sediment altered by impact shock. They also mapped the halo of ejecta - a ring of debris hurled up by the smash, which landed up to tens of miles away from the inner crater. The Lockne impact was created by an object about 1,960ft (600 metres) long, while the Malingen impactor was about 490ft (150 metres) long, the experts said. They were so-called 'rubble pile' asteroids, or fragments travelling in a cluster. 'Doublets' are a debated area of astrophysics. Modelling of asteroids that come close to Earth suggest that about 16 per cent of these objects travel in pairs. But of the 188 known craters on Earth, only 10 - in Canada, Russia, Germany, Finland and Brazil - are considered to be serious candidates as doublets. The twin impact 458 million years ago would be part of a 'shower' of meteors that pummelled Earth after the big breakup in the main asteroid belt. Some experts theorise that this had dramatic consequences for Earth's climate and ecosystems, encouraging an explosion in species called Great Ordovician Biodiversification event. The signature of the event lies in central Sweden - the 4.7 mile (7.5km) Lockne crater, located around 12.4 miles (20 km) south of the city of Oestersund, and a 0.4 miles (700 metre) crater at nearby Malingen .","Craters from the double asteroid strike were found in central Sweden .

"Birmingham Central Library and South Bank Centre in London also named as cultural heritage sites . For years it has hardly merited a second glance and is at risk of demolition - but Preston bus station has been named a 'historic' work of architectural beauty and added to a list of worldwide places that need protection. The bus station in Lancashire, along with a Greek cemetery, the ancient Nazca Lines in Peru and a modernist building in New York are this year's most at-risk cultural heritage sites, according to the World Monuments Fund. Some 67 structures in 41 countries have been placed on a 'Watch' list by the non-profit organisation which supports the preservation of 'treasured places'. 'Historic': Preston bus station in Lancashire has been added to a list of protected world monuments because of its 'concrete brutalist' style . The sites on the 2012 list balance heritage concerns with the social, economic, and environmental interests of communities around the world, said World Monuments Fund President Bonnie Burnham. Miss Burnham said: 'While these sites are historic, they are also very much of the present - integral parts of the lives of the people who come into contact with them every day. 'Indeed, the Watch reminds us of our collective role as stewards of the earth and of its human heritage.' The WMF is an independent organisation which aims to secure the future of 'exceptional' places through fundraising, conservation and education. Among the newly-listed sites is the First Cemetery of Athens, the oldest in the Greek capital, which houses the graves of important figures from the past two centuries. The fund said it is in need of preservation as it has fallen into neglect. The ancient Nazca lines and geoglyphs in the desert of southern Peru are also in jeopardy due to poorly managed tourism, says the fund. The giant figures, which were drawn on the stone between 500 BC and 500 AD, were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994. Brutalist style: The distinctive bus station in Lancashire has been slated for demolition despite being recognised as an architectural gem . Desert design: The ancient geoglyphs in the Nazca desert in southern Peru have been protected by UNESCO since 1994 . Built at the end of the 1960s, Preston bus station can hold 80 double-deckers and was once the largest terminal in the world. It was designed by Keith Ingham and Charles Wilson of Building Design Partnership along with E.H Stazicker and is described as having a 'brutalist' style. The building's engineers, Ove Arup and Partners, designed the distinctive curve of the car park balconies after vertical walls proved too expensive. The edges have a functional aspect too - they protect car bumpers from crashing. The structure has been threatened with demolition for around a decade as part of the council's redevelopment scheme. A survey conducted by the Lancashire Evening Post last year found that Preston bus station was the local people's favourite building. Preston Bus Station was once the world's largest but has been slated for demolition as part of a redevelopment scheme by the council. It is listed by the fund along with other British sites described as 'concrete brutalism' including Birmingham Central Library and the Hayward Gallery at the South Bank Centre in London. The library in Birmingham is to be knocked down in 2013 while the gallery in the South Bank complex has been refused listed building status. Miss Burnham added: 'These and other buildings like them date from an era in which government had the resources and the will to create major civic buildings. 'They are too often seen as impediments to private-sector redevelopment.' The World Monuments Fund also questioned the planning permission for recent . alterations to the former Manufacturers Trust Company Building at 510 . Fifth Avenue, a small box-shaped glass building which sits among the Manhattan skyscrapers. A spokesman for the fund said: 'Local advocates filed a lawsuit, and a temporary restraining order on further alterations has been issued. 'While the case seeks to preserve an icon of American modernism, it also serves as an important touchstone for the effectiveness of preservation legislation and policies in the United States, and of the government agencies charged with their enforcement.' Several sites that have been damaged by earthquakes also made the list including locations in Japan, New Zealand and Haiti. Since the fund started in 1996, some 688 sites across 132 countries have been protected. There are seven British sites listed by the WMF this year. The others are: the medieval ruins of Coventry Cathedral; Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire, known as the home of Lord Byron; Quarr Abbey, a working monastery on the Isle of Wight, and St Helena, the island in the South Atlantic where Napoleon was held captive. A . spokesman added: 'The international attention given to . watch sites provides a vital tool with which local entities may leverage . funding from a variety of sources.'

"A pioneering New York City radio personality who was in a New Jersey jail awaiting trial on charges in a child sex sting, died Thursday. Dave Herman, 78, was locked up following his arrest for trying to seduce a seven-year-old girl last year. Herman died at University Hospital in Newark, attorney Marc Agnifilo said. Scroll down for video . Died in custody: Dave Herman was arrested in October in a sting operation and was awaiting pedophile charges when he had a fatal aneurysm . Herman was rushed to the hospital late Wednesday from the county jail after complaining of chest pains. According to Agnifilo, he suffered a fatal aneurysm. Herman had been living in St. Croix, where he was arrested in a sting operation at the airport in October on a charge he tried to transport a seven-year-old girl to the U.S. Virgin Islands for sex. Herman had allegedly been awaiting the arrival a 36-year-old single mother with a young daughter that he thought he had been communicating with in multiple telephone and online conversations about arranging an illegal sexual encounters with the child. According to prosecutors, Herman told the mother, 'I find girls that age incredibly sexy, soft, and their innocence is also a huge turn-on for me. Age six is the perfect time to start her being loved that way,' reports the New York Daily News. Herman had pleaded not guilty to the federal charge, but was denied bail. Agnifilo had suggested that Herman was duped by an undercover police officer. Disc jockey: Herman was a pioneering rock disc jockey in the late 1960s and '70s, when he began experimenting with free-form rock music programming . A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey said they were moving to dismiss the charges, as is standard practice upon the death of a defendant. Agnifilo said he hoped the case wouldn't overshadow Herman's legacy. 'Some would say he lived his last months under a legal cloud and that's true, but we should remember him for the decades he gave the gift of music to people,' Agnifilo said. Herman was a pioneering rock disc jockey in the late 1960s and `70s, when he began experimenting with free-form rock music programming, something that was novel at the time on FM radio, according to Paul Heine, a senior editor at Inside Radio, an industry trade publication. Herman worked at Philadelphia's WMMR, and later worked for decades as a morning DJ at New York City's WNEW, where he remained until 1998, Heine said. 'WNEW was one of the most watched stations in the country in its `70s heyday, and he was a cornerstone of the legendary rock radio air staff there,' Heine said.","Dave Herman, 78, died Thursday after suffering a brain aneurysm .

"Precision Guided Firearms (PGFs) that can automatically aim at targets? Terrifyingly, there’s an app for that. Known as TagTrackXact (TTX), Texas firm TrackingPoint’s software is used to enable an advanced array of weaponry. And in a new video, one YouTube user shows how TTX lets him hit a smartphone with a rifle from one kilometre (0.62 miles) away. Scroll down for video . TrackingPoint's TagTrackXact software enables a shooter to accurately fire at targets by 'painting' them in the distance before the software helps them align their gun. Others can even follow along with the action on an iOS app on an iPhone or an iPad (pictured) In the video YouTube user RatedRR is firing the XS1 .338 Lapua Magnum, which he says is the ‘largest-calibre Precision Guided Firearm available today.’ A laser rangefinder is used by the shooter looking through the scope to identify the target that he or she wants to hit. The . high-tech sight then takes into account humidity, wind and the typical . ballistic drop you'd expect from a bullet fired over such a distance. Once . the target has been selected, the scope provides cross-hairs which have . to be lined up with the pin that is dropped on the target. To ensure accuracy, the shooter can not even squeeze the trigger unless the cross-hairs and pin are alined. The rifle employs the aforementioned TTX targeting system, which boasts a range of up to 1.1 kilometres (0.68 miles). Using the system allows for accurate and precise shots of a distant target - even one as small as a smartphone. To shoot at something, the shooter first 'marks' it using a button near the trigger. Marking a target illuminates it with the tracking scope's built-in laser, and the target gains a red pin in the scope's display. The scope then provides cross-hairs that have to be lined up with the pin, with the shooter not able to pull the trigger unless the two are aligned. In the video YouTube user RatedRR fires several shots at an HTC One (stock image shown), highlighting the impressive level of accuracy of the gun. He mentions, though, that the central dot is quite big so at a distance of one kilometre (0.62 miles) it is hard to know which part of the phone he is shooting at . The US military has been testing out some of the Precision Guided Firearms (pictured) with a view to employing them in the field in the future. Back in January it was reported they acquired six $27,000 (£16,000) smart rifles from Texas-based TrackingPoint . The rifle also offers an iOS app that connects to the scope via a mobile Wi-Fi network and streams the scope's display to the app, allowing someone with an iPad or iPhone to act as a spotter and for videos to be uploaded to the Internet. This allows hunters to gain instant advice on their aim from experts using the Internet and more interestingly allows shooters to video anything they shoot on an expedition and upload it onto the web as proof. The makers of the rifle also claim that the gun is safer than a standard bolt action rifle. This is because a large number of injuries are caused by recoiling guns fired by nervous shooters with twitch fingers. TrackingPoint’s rifle increases the pull strength of the trigger until the target is aligned. In this way, the hunter is more likely to hit their target and accidental firings can be largely avoided. The smart rifles can shoot even if the target is moving as fast as 10 miles (16 kilometres) per hour. All of TrackingPoint’s firearms use the company’s TTX system – which tracks range, drop, magnus effect, spindrift, coriolis effect, direction, cant, inclination, pressure, temperature, humidity, muzzle velocity, barrel length and twist, lock time, ballistic coefficient and drag coefficient.","A new YouTube video shows off a Precision Guided Firearm (PGF)

"Far-flung family members, co-workers and friends frantically used social media, cellphones and even a Google 'people finder' website to try to learn the fate of participants and spectators at the Boston Marathon. The . search was made more difficult because heavy cellphone use caused slow . and delayed service. In an age connected by everything digital, the . hours after the blasts produced a tense silence.

The site allows users to . enter the name of a person they're looking for or update information . about someone who was there. Google's person finder was invaluable for those trying to find their loved ones in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing . A few hours after the explosion, the site . indicated it was tracking 5,100 records. At . the race, 51-year-old Julie Jeske, of Bismarck, N.D., had finished . about 15 minutes before the explosions and was about two blocks away . when she heard two loud booms. She immediately tried to call her parents . but could not place the call. A friend was able to post on Facebook . that they were OK, but reaching her parents was another worry. 'I . wasn't able to call and I felt so bad,' Jeske said. 'When I was finally . able to reach them, my mom said she was just absolutely beside herself . with fear.'

Cliggett said she went to the marathon's website and tried to calculate . where the couple should be based on their last locations and running . speeds. She decided they should have already finished the race when the . blasts hit. 'The question is, do you loiter around the finish line?' she said. 'And where was the bomb?' Finally, . about three hours after the blasts, the couple called their sons to . tell they were unhurt. Matt Cliggett sent his sister a text that said, 'We were about 100 yards from second explosion.

"Too much sugar may be bad for the waistline, but it could help doctors heal the sick. New research shows folk medicine from Africa may hold the key to treating wounds that defy modern medicine. A study found granulated sugar poured directly into bed sores, leg ulcers and even amputations promotes healing when antibiotics and other treatments have failed. According to the study, sugar draws water from the wound into a dressing accelerating the healing process. The traditional remedy was suggested by Moses Murandu (left) for treating Alan Bayliss (right) The study is headed by Moses Murandu, a senior lecturer in adult nursing at Wolverhampton University, who grew up in Zimbabwe where his father used sugar to heal wounds and reduce pain when he was a child. Sugar draws water from the wound into a dressing - bacteria needs water to survive - which allows accelerates the healing process, or kick starts it where progress has stalled. When Mr Murandu moved to the UK he realised that sugar was not recognised as a traditional medicine that had something to offer. One of the patients receiving treatment as part of the research is Alan Bayliss, from Birmingham, who was being treated at Moseley Hall Hospital’s amputee rehabilitation ward. He underwent an above the knee amputation on his right leg due to an ulcer at the Queen Elizabeth (QE) Hospital Birmingham in January 2013, and as part of the surgery a vein was removed from his left leg. For his post-surgery rehabilitation, Mr Bayliss was moved to Moseley Hall Hospital where standard dressings were used but the left leg cavity wound was not healing effectively. Nurses contacted Mr Murandu and Mr Bayliss was given the sugar treatment and within two weeks the wound had drastically reduced in size. Mr Bayliss, a 62-year-old electrical engineer, said: ‘It has been revolutionary. The actual wound was very deep - it was almost as big as my finger . ‘When Moses first did the dressing he almost used the whole pot of sugar, but two weeks later he only needed to use 4 or 5 teaspoons. A British amputee had an open wound healed with the novel sugar treatment. Alan Bayliss, from Birmingham, had . his right leg amputated above the knee, and one of his veins removed . after developing a huge ulcer. However, the resulting wound refused to heal, until a nursing lecturer suggested a sugar treatment used in his native Zimbabwe. Moses Murandu applied a whole pot of . sugar at first, but was down to five teaspoons two weeks later. He said . it works by drawing water away from the wound, as water is needed for . bacteria to multiply. Now the electrical engineer is on the road to recovery at the Moseley Hall Hospital, Birmingham. Mr Bayliss, 62, said:  'It has made me feel so much better and I'm not in pain anymore. 'It's three weeks later and the wound has really come together.' Mr Murandu is now halfway through his . randomised control trial at three West Midlands hospitals - Moseley . Hall, the Queen Elizabeth Hospital and Manor Hospital in Walsall. So far 35 patients have successfully received the treatment, with no adverse effects reported. Mr Murandu, 47, said: 'I'm so pleased with the results and the reaction my treatment is receiving. ""When I was a child my father used to treat my cuts with sugar, so I was to surprised to find that didn't exist here in the UK.' ‘I am very pleased indeed. I feel that it has speeded up my recovery a lot, and it has been a positive step forward. 'I . was a little sceptical at first but once I saw the sugar in operation . and how much it was drawing the wound out, I was impressed.’ Staff Nurse Jonathan Janneman said: ‘One of the main benefits has been the morale of the patient. He could see the cavity in his leg as well as having been unwell and through operations. ‘But the sugar has given something to hold on to. It is amazing that something as simple as sugar has given him a morale boost - the psychological benefit is up there with the physical benefits. 'The patient is ecstatic with the results.’ Mr Murandu is undertaking a trial at three West Midlands hospitals - Moseley Hall, the QE Hospital and Manor Hospital in Walsall - into using the sugar paste. So far 35 patients receiving treatment have seen their condition improve, with no adverse effects reported, compared with 16 patients who did not have the treatment. The treatment works because bacteria need water to grow, so applying sugar to a wound draws the water away and starves the bacteria of water. This prevents the bacteria from multiplying and they die. Mr Murandu said pure sugar was used which had to go through infection control procedures. He said ‘In Africa we would get the sugar from the supermarket, here it has to go through our aseptic services department. ‘The only problem we have is asking people to be prepared not to get the treatment - they have already been on standard treatment of antibiotics and modern dressings which hasn’t worked.’ Mr Murandu, who has won an innovation award for his research, said: ‘It is very pleasing for me to see the results, especially now that the nurses are able to take over and administer the treatment after I have made the initial assessment, and also that the patients are experiencing the benefits. ‘I believe in the sugar and the nurses and doctors who see the effects are beginning to believe in it too. I’d like to thank the University and the School of Health and Wellbeing for their support and also the patients for taking part.’","Folk medicine from Africa may hold the key to treating wounds that defy modern medicine .

"A mother of three has spoken about her anger and humiliation after she was visited by Child Protective Services for letting her 6-year-old son play outside unsupervised. Children's book author Kari Anne Roy, who lives in Austin, Texas, wrote on her blog HaikuMama last week about how an unidentified neighbor rang her doorbell and told her she was returning her son. The woman had spied Roy’s youngest, 6-year-old Isaac, sitting alone on a bench about 150 yards for his home and had approached him and asked where he lived. ‘Then the woman smiled condescendingly, explained that he was OUTSIDE. And he was ALONE. And she was RETURNING HIM SAFELY. To stay INSIDE. With an ADULT,’ wrote Roy. ‘I thanked her for her concern, quickly shut the door and tried to figure out what just happened.’ Not long after Roy received another knock at her door and was shocked to find a policewoman who was following up a complaint made by the neighbor, referred to by Roy as a busybody. The police woman quizzed Roy about her children and asked if her son had been missing. Then a week later Roy received a visit from Child Protective Services who also wanted up to question her and her children. A neighbor found Roy's 6-year-old Isaac sitting alone on the bench and returned him to his mom's house . ‘My eight year old was very concerned about the questions that were asked, like had she seen people's private parts or those types of movies, and those are things she had not really thought of or known existed,’ Roy said. Roy took to her blog to express her anger saying she was ‘struck dumb’ by the fact anyone would question her parenting. ‘I was humiliated and really angry after that. Really, really angry,’ Roy told KEYE. Roy also defended her decision to let her son out on his own and said the bench was visible from my front porch and that Isaac had been playing with my 8-year-old daughter until a couple of minutes before the busybody arrived. The mom-of-three also says that she understands why the CPS had to by law investigate the incident. Roy says she was 'humiliated and really angry' after a busybody neighbor called the police expressing concerning for the welfare of her children . 'Having CPS have to come to a house because a child was playing outside takes away their time and resources from investigating the kids that really need it,' Roy said. The incident month early in August and Roy only felt it was safe to blog about the experience after she was informed last week that the case was officially closed. When Roy asked the CPS investigator what happened next, she was advised not to let her children play outside for fear of another complaint.","Kari Anne Roy has spoken about her anger and humiliation after she was visited by Child Protective Services for letting her son play outside .

"Ian Brooks, 47, was battling with a rare form of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, a cancer affecting the immune system . Suffering from a rare and aggressive form of cancer, Ian Brooks was given only weeks to live. With around 70 tumours throughout his body, doctors admitted they had almost run out of treatment options. But incredibly Mr Brooks, 47, is now in ‘complete remission’ after he became the first person outside the US to receive a new tumour-busting drug. These pictures show how far the Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma had spread, with almost every area of his body showing clusters of tumours. But the second scan taken after only a few weeks on the US drug Brentuximab Vedotin shows an amazing improvement. All the tumours have been eradicated. The only dark spots visible on the scan show the normal functioning of his kidneys and bladder. The clinical trial at The Christie Hospital in Manchester has been so successful that the drug has been made routinely available to other sufferers. Now NHS patients with the same rare form of Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma can get the drug through the Cancer Drugs Fund. Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma is a cancer which involves the lymph nodes, with the NHS treating around 1,500 new cases a year. Mr Brooks, an engine repair technician from Bolton, said: ‘I don’t think I would be here today without  that drug. ‘My specialist was so excited when he saw the results that he showed me them straight away. I had 60 or 70 tumours and they had gone.’ He had a rare form of Non-Hodgkin’s called Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma. Brentuximab Vedotin targets this strain of the disease and can put patients into ‘complete remission’ when there would otherwise be few treatment options available. Scans of Mr Brook's body before and after treatment. The left shows him riddled with 60-70 tumours from Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. The right scan is 12 weeks after he became the first person outside the U.S. to have a pioneering cancer drug. The black dots are his kidney and his bladder . The drug Adcetris, the trade name for Brentuximab Vedotin, is administered through a drip into the arm every three weeks for up to a year. Part of a new wave of targeted therapy, it homes in on a protein on the surface of cancer cells, where it sticks and delivers a drug that kills the cell. It is offered to patients who have no other options left, and trials show that in up to a third of cases it eradicates all signs of the cancer. It can still come back, but some patients have survived for more than three years, which has led to talk of a possible cure. Adcetris can have serious or possibly life-threatening side effects including a rare brain infection. It was given conditional approval by the European drug watchdog in 2012. Mr Brooks was diagnosed in 2001 and at . first responded well to treatment, but in 2008 the cancer returned. He . had a stem cell transplant, but once again the cancer returned and . spread ferociously. Given . only weeks to live, he volunteered to take part in the clinical trial. ‘I knew I needed something pretty radical in order to survive,’ he said. He . began to show improvements within 24 hours of starting the drug and . consultants at The Christie, the largest specialist cancer centre in . Europe, were amazed when they looked at his scans. After only 12 weeks of treatment they found his body was clear of tumours and now believe he is in ‘complete remission’. His doctor, Dr Adam Gibb, a clinical research fellow in lymphoma at The Christie, said: ‘The drug can be administered rapidly and has few side effects. 'This is probably the most impressive set of scans I’ve seen. Ian was really up against it. He is in remission and we are increasingly confident about him.’ Professor John Radford, research and development director at The Christie, said: ‘Stories such as this illustrate the value of clinical trials. Individual patients can benefit and the knowledge we acquire allows us to move on to the next stage in developing the treatments of tomorrow. ‘I hope that more patients will ask their doctors about clinical trial opportunities.’ Mr Brooks went on to have a bone marrow transplant. This week he was discharged from his treatment at The Christie. He said: ‘I can’t thank the NHS and the hospital enough. They gave me back my life.’ Mr Brooks before his treatment, with approximately 60-70 tumours from his cancer. He had just weeks to live after all other treatments have failed .

He said: 'It feels like I've got someone watching over me because after all of the treatment and tumours I've had, I'm still here' Mr Brooks is now clear of the tumours and in remission.

"For the past 10 years, Chelsea have been investing heavily in youth development and it would seem Roman Abramovich's big spending is finally starting to bear fruit. From Premier League first team down to Under-18 level, Chelsea are topping every table. While Jose Mourinho's side sit seven points clear at the top of England's top flight, the Chelsea youngsters are following suit at Under-21, Under-19 and Under-18 levels while fighting for FA Youth Cup and UEFA Youth League glory. The Chelsea first team are currently seven points clear at the top of the Premier League . Diego Costa has scored 17 Premier League goals for Jose Mourinho's side this season . Starting with the first team, Mourinho's side are well on course for a first Premier League title since 2010 as they look to fight off competition from defending champions Manchester City. With a seven point advantage and 13 games remaining, Mourinho will fancy his chances at bringing silverware back to Stamford Bridge. Summer signing Diego Costa has been a revelation, scoring 17 Premier League goals since his £32million move while former Barcelona and Arsenal star Cesc Fabregas has slotted seamlessly into Chelsea's midfield. Despite a 2-1 defeat against rivals Manchester United last week, Chelsea's Under-21 side are currently joint-top of the domestic youth league sitting ahead of United and Southampton thanks to a superior goal difference. The squad is packed full of promising young English talent with the likes of Roben Loftus-Cheek, Isaiah Brown and Dominic Solanke helping the young Blues to bag 25 goals in just 12 games so far. www.squawka.com .

Mourinho was so impressed with Loftus-Cheek and Brown that he decided to promote both players to the Chelsea first team in February, handing the former his Premier League debut in the 1-1 draw against City last month. Many of the players involved were part of Chelsea's FA Youth Cup and Under-21 Premier League title double last season which seems to have instilled a winning spirit amongst the group. As well as domestic success, the Blues fledglings cruised through the the UEFA Youth League last 16 with five wins in six games against Schalke, Sporting Lisbon and Maribor.

"Row: John Craven, a Christian preacher, was arrested and kept in police cells for 19 hours after he quoted the Bible's stance on homosexuality at two gay teenagers . A Christian street preacher was wrongly arrested and held in a police cell for almost 19 hours after quoting verses from the Bible. John Craven, 57, recited from Revelation after two gay teenagers asked about his views on homosexuality. But after he read from chapter 21, verse eight – which says sinners will burn in a lake of fire and sulphur – police arrested him on suspicion of committing a public order offence. He was taken to a police cell where he claims he was denied food, water and access to medication for his rheumatoid arthritis. He was fingerprinted, had to give a sample of his DNA and told he was being investigated for allegedly using insulting words with the intention of causing harassment, alarm or distress – which could have led to a six-month jail sentence. Two days later, however, police told him there would be no charges and no further action. Yesterday he was awarded £13,000 in compensation after a three-year legal battle against Greater Manchester Police which is estimated to have cost the public purse £50,000. Mr Craven said: ‘I never intended to cause anyone harassment, alarm or distress. I preach the gospel, which means good news and the love of God for all. ‘At the end of the day God loves everybody, but homosexuality is a sin and I am not going to contradict the word of God.’ He added: ‘The actions of the police have left me feeling nervous and anxious. ‘I was in a cell on my own. I was fingerprinted, swabbed and had my photo taken. They took my shoelaces from me. They said I would not be interviewed until the next day and then they left me.’ Incident: Mr Craven said he was on his usual spot in Market Street in the centre of Manchester, when the men approached him to ask his opinion on homosexuality and claims the two men then kissed in front of him before calling for his arrest . The incident happened in 2011 when Mr . Craven, who has been street preaching for 14 years, was at his regular . twice-weekly pitch in Manchester city centre. Mr . Craven, who is married, said: ‘Two young lads asked me what God thinks . of homosexuals. I told them whilst God hates sin, he loves the sinner . and that according to the word of God homosexuality is an abomination. That is not my opinion, it is the word of God. ‘I . quoted them Revelation chapter 21, verse eight, “But for the cowardly, . unbelieving, sinners, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, . sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their part is in the lake that . burns with fire and sulphur, which is the second death”. ‘This made them upset and they started to do obscene gestures to me. They were trying to provoke me.’ Case: A preacher has won £13,000 from Greater Manchester Police, pictured, who arrested him after he told a gay couple the bible said homosexuality is a sin . The . boys then told a policeman his comments had caused them distress. The . constable was alleged to have grabbed Mr Craven roughly by the arm . before arresting him. From . the time of his arrest at 7.15pm until 9.30am the next day he was given . nothing to eat before eventually being given a bowl of cereal. Mr . Craven won damages under the Human Rights Act using his entitlement to . enjoy the freedom to manifest his religion and freedom of expression, . including the freedom to impart ideas without interference by a public . authority. Colin Hart, . director of The Christian Institute which funded Mr Craven’s case, said: . ‘In terms of the infringement of religious liberty, it was one of the . worst cases we have ever dealt with.’ A . spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: ‘We acknowledge that we . did make mistakes and, in particular, kept the claimant in custody for . too long.’","John Craven, 57, sued for unlawful arrest, false imprisonment and human rights breach .

"The federal government plans to begin taking the temperatures of travelers from West Africa arriving at five U.S. airports in order to screen them for Ebola, but the White House said Wednesday that federal agents will only screen about 150 passengers per day. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the five airports cover the destinations of 94 percent of the people who travel to the U.S. from the three heavily hit countries in West Africa – Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. It has been just ten days since a Liberian man was rushed to a Dallas, Texas hospital with the first case of Ebola diagnosed on U.S. soil. He was pronounced dead on Wednesday morning. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Thomas Frieden told reporters Wednesday that 'as long as Ebola continues to spread in Africa, we can't make the risk zero here.' Dialed in: President Barack Obama participated in a conference call Wednesday with state and local officials to discuss the Ebola epidemic in West Africa . Coming to America: Duncan, seen here with a female relative shortly after landing at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, traveled to the US to marry his longtime love Louise Troh . But extra Ebola screening will be put in place at New York's John F. Kennedy, Newark Liberty,Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta. 'These five airports are the destination of 94 percent of . individuals who travel to the United States from the three . countries that are currently affected by Ebola,' Earnest said in a news briefing. The new targeted screening regime will only apply to inbound international travelers who have visited Ebola-hit nations. The plan calls for 'targeted questions, temperature checks and contact information' collected in airports, according to Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who joined Frieden in the press conference via telephone. Earnest called the administration's strategy 'an additional layer of screening that can be . targeted to that small population in a way that will enhance . security but also minimize disruption to the broader traveling . public.' The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Wednesday that the federal government will start an 'enhanced' screening protocol targeting about 150 inbound airline passengers every day who arrive from Guinea, Liberia or Sierra Leone, or who have passed through those countries. The CDC says that 94 per cent of U.S.-bound airline passengers arrive in America at one of just five airports, so they are limiting the new plan to those locations. The CDC says all passengers headed out of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea are already screened before they are allowed to board airplanes. So far 77 of them have been stopped from boarding because they had fevers. But most of these people were diagnosed with malaria – a very common illness in Africa – not Ebola. Malaria is not communicable from one person to another, and is spread by contact with infected mosquitos. The Obama administration, and the CDC specifically, have said repeatedly that it would be counterproductive to restrict air travel from western African nations where Ebola is running rampant. Prohibiting the entry of commercial flights from that region, the government claims, would limit the options for sending supplies and relief personnel back to where they are needed. The CDC did not immediately respond to a question after the press conference about why military aircraft aren't used for that purpose. President Obama has already dispatched close to 4,000 military personnel to Liberia to help with constructing field hospitals and other mission-critical activities. He said Wednesday during a conference call with state and local government leaders that 'in recent months, thousands of travelers arrived here from West Africa, and so far, only one case of Ebola has been diagnosed in the United States.' 'And that’s the patient in Dallas who we know, sadly, passed away,' Obama noted, 'and our thoughts today are with his family.' In his press conference, Frieden led with confident gusto, insisting that 'we have stopped every Ebola outbreak until this one.' 'The only people with Ebola in the United States are in hospitals,' he said. But he admitted that the Homeland Security Department will be testing a 'particularly small' group of people. 'We're talking about 150 travelers per day,' he said. Frieden also  conceded that the new measures might not have flagged Liberian national Thomas Duncan, the U.S. 'index patient' who died Wednesday ten days after entering a hospital isolation ward. Duncan lied about his contact with a contagious Ebola patient when he left Liberia en route to Brussels, Washington, D.C. and finally Dallas. 'It is true that the index patient, when he left Africa, did not have a temperature,' Frieden said, and also seemed healthy when he arrived in the U.S. The 'additional questions' he would have faced if he arrived today instead 'may have identified him as a contact,' the CDC chief insisted, but couldn't say with certainty whether the outcome would have been different. Taking their temperature: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Thomas Frieden talked to reporters Wednesday about new procedures for screening inbound airline passengers . Doctor's (Oval) Office: Obama participated in an Ebola-related conference call on Wednesday . The new strategy, he said, is intended to 'increase the likelihood that if someone arrives and develops Ebola, they will be rapidly identified and isolated.' Mayorkas said Customs and Border Protection agents – the same cadre of officials responsible for screening luggage for contraband – are handing out information sheets to travelers with details of what symptoms to look for and directions to call doctors if they become sick within 21 days – the incubation period for Ebola. Homeland Security agents at airports and other ports of entry already had begun observing travelers coming into the United States for potential signs of Ebola infection, he emphasized. The fact sheet to be given to arriving travelers says: 'You were given this card because you arrived to the United States from a country with Ebola.' It tells passengers to 'please watch your health for the next 21 days' and to 'take your temperature every morning and evening, and watch for symptoms of Ebola,' which are listed on the sheet. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said customs agents 'will continue to observe all travelers entering the United States for general overt signs of illnesses at all U.S. ports of entry.' Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the new plan calls for 'targeted questions, temperature checks and contact information' collected in airports . This image provided by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) shows a flyer given to people arriving in the US. The Homeland Security Department has ordered agents at airports and other ports of entry to observe everyone coming into the United States for potential signs of Ebola infection, officials said Wednesday . Mayorkas said the department was aware of those issues and is 'taking a layered approach.' Ebola has killed more than 3,400 people in West Africa and infected at least twice that many, according to the World Health Organization. The virus has taken an especially devastating toll on health care workers, sickening or killing more than 370 of them in the hardest-hit countries of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone – places that already were short on doctors and nurses before Ebola. Obama has said the U.S. will be 'working on protocols to do additional passenger screening both at the source and here in the United States.' 'Screening of outbound travelers is already underway' at airports in the target zone, Frieden said Wednesday. 'It has been going on for some time.'","White House announced a new regime of targeted screening that will only apply to inbound international travelers who have visited Ebola-hit nations .

"An incredible whirlwind of gas and fire, swirling 3,280ft (1km) into the air, has been captured above Iceland’s Bardarbunga volcano. The stunning footage was taken last week by an aircraft-fitted infrared camera designed to monitor potentially dangerous ash clouds. Scientists are still unsure what caused the tornado-like phenomenon, but have suggested it may be due to the difference between hot and colder air, causing something akin to a ‘dust devil.’ Scroll down for videos . An incredible tornado of gas and fire, swirling 3,280ft (1km) into the air, has been captured above Iceland's rumbling Bardarbunga volcano . 'The generation mechanism is probably the same as that for dust devils, but in this case the tornado funnel is most likely filled with sulphur dioxide, gas and volcanic ash,’ said Nicarnica Aviation told Paul Marks at New Scientist. Dust devils are small, rotating columns of air which can be seen because of the dust and debris they pick up from the ground. They form because hot air close to the ground rises, punching through the layer of cooler denser air above. The rising plumes of hot air and falling plumes of cool air begin circulating vertically in something known as ‘convection cells’. This amazing aerial shots of the erupting Bardarbunga, Iceland's largest volcano. was taken by a helicopter hovering over the molten lava by photographer Iurie Belegurschi . Steam and smoke rise over a fissure in a lava field north of the Vatnajokull glacier, which covers part of Bardarbunga volcano system. Yesterday morning, an earthquake struck the region around the volcano while fissures in the area continued to spew out lava . Scientists are watching closely to see how molten rock at and below the surface will interact with glacial ice, surface melt, and groundwater . If a horizontal gust of wind blows, it turns the circulating air cells, so they begin spinning horizontally, forming vertical columns - and starting a dust devil. Bardarbunga, which has erupted more lava than any other volcano on the planet in the last 10,000 years, has awakened since mid-August. Scientists are still unsure what caused . the tornado, but have suggested it may be due to the difference between . hot and colder air, causing something akin to a ‘dust devil.’ Dust devils are small, rotating columns of air can be seen because of the dust and debris they pick up from the ground.

The . rising plumes of hot air and falling plumes of cool air begin . circulating vertically in something known as ‘convection cells’. Yesterday morning, an earthquake struck the region around the volcano while fissures in the area continued to spew out lava. The earthquake occurred at 0808 BST and reached a magnitude of 5.4, making it one of the bigger quakes in the area in central Iceland since significant tremors began on August 16. 'There was also another quake, magnitude 4.6 at 0430 (BST) in the night,' said Bergthora Thorbjarnardottir, geologist at the Icelandic Meteorological Office. 'Seismic activity underneath Bardarbunga volcano is still ongoing but remains steady,' she added. Lava from the fissures around Bardarbunga has so far reached the surface only on land that is not covered by ice. But scientists warn an eruption under an ice cap may be explosive and result in an ash cloud that could under certain circumstances disrupt aviation. In 2010, a cloud of abrasive ash from the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, in a different region of Iceland, closed much of Europe's air space for six days after an eruption under the ice cap. The ash warning level for aviation related to the current fissure eruptions remained at orange, the second-highest level on a five-colour scale, after several brief hikes to the top red in recent weeks. The Icelandic Met Office says the lava eruptions and fire fountains from Bardabunga currently present no threat to flights. Hot air rising above Bardarbunga, located under Vatnajökull, Iceland's most extensive glacier, is thought to have created the tornado of fire . Images of the gaping fissure, volatile lava fountains and a billowing cloud of steam and gas reveal the raw beauty and brute force of volcanic activity .

They are currently being cared for round-the-clock by nurses in the NICU at Utah Valley regional Medical Center in Provo. In an update on their Facebook page, Mrs Gardner wrote about the 'incredible' experience it was to finally take one of her babies home after giving birth in December. However, she says the moment was bittersweet since the couple had to leave their three other daughters behind. 'I haven't stopped crying since we brought her home because of this incredible joy I am feeling,' Mrs Gardner wrote. 'But at the same time 3 pieces of our hearts are left behind at the NICU tonight. I know they aren't going to be too far behind Evangeline here but the thought of separating them made my soul ache!' Sisterhood: Babies Indie, Evangeline, Scarlett and Esme pictured together on February 1 . On Tuesday, Mrs Gardner detailed baby Evangeline's surprisingly peaceful first night at home. 'Last night went great!!! Miss Evie just slept and cooed all night. There was even one stent where she slept for 4 straight hours! Yay! We are exhausted and so happy to be! 'In the middle of the night when we were half asleep and I was feeding her she was making all these cute little grunting noises and we just started laughing. 'We are so happy to have her home and to start learning how to juggle everything!' Mrs Gardner wrote. The Gardners first gained national attention in October, when they released photos showing Mrs Gardner's shocked expression when she learned they were having four babies during an ultrasound. How many?! The image above shows the moment Ashley discovered that her fertility treatment had gone rather better than she had expected . Unlikely: Ashley says that the chances of her conceiving the four girls - and them surviving to be born - is around 70million-to-one . The couple went on to become a national sensation, documenting their unique pregnancy on social media. 'People identify with our story. There are hundreds, thousands of people that struggle with infertility,' Tyson Gardner said. 'Our story's a story of hope.' 'It was scary at first, and then, you know, the second you see the babies' faces and hear them cry, it just is, it's all worth it,' Ashely Gardner said, according to the Deseret News. The quadruplets' survival was called a 'miracle' after emergency surgery was needed to stop  contractions when Ashley was around 20 weeks pregnant. The couple flew to a specialist center at Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital, where Ashley was admitted for surgery in late October. Doctors managed to stave off the earlier delivery after an intense operation, which allowed the unborn babies vital extra weeks to bolster their chances of survival. Mr Gardner said doctors told his wife she needed immediate surgery after it appeared her cervix had started to open and she could be going into early labor. Surgeons also managed to cure two of the girls of their twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), which could have resulted in developmental problems. Doctors made the decision to deliver the babies by C-section after Ashley started experiencing contractions a few weeks early in December. The Gardners posted a picture shortly before the birth of their girls with the message: 'Santa let the elves take over for a bit today so he could come visit us in the hospital!! #happy29weeks' Proud new father Tyson Gardner posted this picture of his wife Ashley with the message: 'Moms saying Hello to Esme!

"Two soldiers could face manslaughter charges following the deaths of three Army reservists who died after collapsing from heat exhaustion on an SAS selection exercise in the Brecon Beacons, it emerged yesterday. L/Cpl Craig Roberts, 24, L/Cpl Edward Maher, 31, and Cpl James Dunsby, 31, died last summer after a 40-mile hike in soaring 29.5C (85F) temperatures. Witnesses at the time reported seeing soldiers on the training exercise in distress and pleading for water in the Welsh valleys. L/Cpl Craig Roberts (left) and Cpl James Dunsby (right) died during a training exercise in Brecon Beacons . The Brecon Beacons is one of several locations used by the British military for training. Its rugged and sprawling terrain is said to help prepare soldiers physically and mentally for warfare . L/Cpl Edward Maher, 31, died last summer after a 40-mile hike in soaring 29.5C (85F) temperatures . L/Cpl Roberts, from Penrhyn Bay, Conwy, and L/Cpl Mayer were pronounced dead that same day but Cpl Dunsby, from Bath, Somerset, died a fortnight later in a Birmingham hospital. Yesterday a pre-inquest hearing was told the trio died from ‘over-heating’ following the gruelling selection exercise on July 13. It also emerged the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) are expected to make a decision on whether to charge two SAS personnel (identified only as 1a and 1b) in charge on the day with gross negligence manslaughter by the end of this month. Speaking at the hearing, Det Supt Shane Williams from Dyfed-Powys Police said: ‘This is a joint investigation involving the Health and Safety Executive and Dyfed-Powys Police and the investigation focuses on 1a and 1b and focuses on manslaughter gross negligence. ‘There have been 166 statements taken, 95 related to soldiers engaged in the activities on that day in July. ‘At this moment in time we have the final statement from the pathologist who provided the cause of death of the three individuals. ‘The CPS have decided to engage a further expert in heat exhaustion and he has supplied a 53-page paper. ‘A decision will made whether we will prosecute 1a and 1b by no later than June 28.’ The families of the three soldiers who attended the pre-inquest at Solihull Council House were also told the causes of their loved ones’ deaths for the first time. Louise Hunt, the coroner for the City of Birmingham and the Borough of Solihull, said that Cpl Dunsby had died from ‘multi-organ failure as a result of hyperthermia’. A aign at one of the entrances to the base in Sennybridge, Powys, Wales where the three reservists collapsed during exercises . Another entrances to the base in Sennybridge, Powys,where the reservists were seen pleading for water . She added that L/Cpl Roberts and L/Cpl Maher both had died from ‘the effects of hyperthermia’. Deciding that the three-week inquest would be held without a jury on October 20, Mrs Hunt added: ‘If we were to have a jury it would certainly take a lot longer. ‘The complex nature of the expert evidence is likely to be difficult for a jury to grapple with. ‘We have a lot of technical matters to deal with in terms of the army and the SAS structures.’ The coroner then adjourned the hearing for another pre-inquest review which is due to be held in Birmingham on August 19. L/Cpl Craig Roberts with Lizzy Rob who is believed to have been his girlfriend (left) and in fatigues (right) Cpl Dunsby’s widow Bryher looked tearful during proceedings and as she left the hour-long hearing. The soldier’s father Joseph was also present along with L/Cpl Maher’s parents and L/Cpl Roberts’s parents and sister. Representatives of the Ministry of Defence, the Health and Safety Executive and Dyfed-Powys Police were also in attendance. The three soldiers died after collapsing during the military exercise on south Wales’ highest mountain Pen y Fan in the Brecon Beacons on July 13 – one of the hottest days of last year. L/Cpl Roberts was pronounced dead on the mountain at 5.15pm, while L/Cpl Maher died at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil almost three hours later. Cpl Dunsby died at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham two weeks later on July 30. It is believed the trio were taking part in the gruelling ‘Fan Dance’ which involves marching up the mountain, down the other side and back again carrying a weighted pack and rifle. They then have to do the route in reverse in a set time as they march from checkpoint to checkpoint against the clock. The Brecon Beacons is one of several locations used by the British military for training.

"Seeking freedom: Daniel Villegas, 35, has spent the last 18 years in prison after being convicted of killing two men . A Texas man who has spent nearly two decades in prison after admitting to killing two men in a drive-by shooting when he was 16 year old is now asking for a new trial, and he may yet get a chance at freedom. Villegas, who is now 35, continues to insist that the confession that led to his conviction, and which he has since recanted, was obtained by coercion. A private investigator hired by his supporters, a team from Northwestern University Law School's Center on Wrongful Convictions of Youth and a pair of men exonerated after serving time for murder have backed up his claims of innocence . Most importantly, Jesse Hernandez, who survived the 1993 shooting, said that Villegas is not the killer. ‘I believe with all my heart he is innocent,’ Hernandez told FoxNews.com. ‘I always thought I knew who else might have done it from the beginning. I had never heard of Daniel before.’ Villegas’ defense team filed a writ of habeas corpus, citing ineffective assistance of counsel and actual innocence as their reasons for retrial. The 35-year-old convict will learn his fate on Thursday when Texas 409th District Court Judge Sam Medrano is expected to rule on whether to grant him one last chance to prove his innocence in what will be his third murder trial. ‘I'm going to delve into this,’ Medrano told El Paso Times. ‘I'm going to start working on the proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. When I believe that I may be ready to make my decision I will notify the parties.’ The evidence the defense submitted includes 13 discs containing the full length conversations Villegas had with family and friends while at the El Paso County Jail. Bad reputation: Villegas was a 16-year-old high school dropout with ties to a gang when he signed a confession admitting to the murders . Grave allegations: Villegas has claimed that a detective obtained his confession by force after hitting and threatening him . Prosecutors objected to the discs with more than 400 phone conversations being admitted, dismissing them as irrelevant to the case. For Villegas, the chain of events that landed him behind bars goes back to 1993 when four men, including Hernandez, Juan Carlos Medina and murder victims Armando ‘Mando’ Lazo, 18, and Robert England, 17, were walking along Electric Avenue in El Paso, Texas. A car with three people inside pulled up, and one passenger demanded ‘Que Barrio?’ – a slang term which means ‘what gang are you with?’ In response, two of the men ran away, and two others were shot dead in a vacant lot. England suffered a single gunshot wound to the head and died on scene. Lazo was shot once in the abdomen and once in the thigh. His body was found outside a nearby home where he had desperately tried to seek help. Soon after, police investigating the murders focused on Villegas as a suspect. The 16-year-old boy was a high school dropout and a known gang member who had a reputation for telling tall tales in an effort to boost his street cred. Crime scene: Villegas was arrested in 1993 after two men were gunned down in El Paso in what appears to be a gang-related shooting . The teen was arrested in connection with the deadly shootings, and just hours later police got a confession penned in a third-grade level of writing. In the document, Villegas noted that a detective offered him a Coke, and he apologized to the families of the victims. According to Villegas’ team, then-detective Al Marquez used physical violence and threatened the frightened teen into signing the confession, which proved crucial during the trial since investigators had no evidence linking the 16-year-old to the scene of the crime. 'I'm not a saint, but even thought I'm not, you know, I'm not a killer either,' Villegas said in an interview with News Channel 9 last November. The story of a forced confession rang true for Hernandez, who was also questioned following the murders. ‘They tried to do that to me, but I kind of put things together,’ he told Fox News. ‘They pushed him. They had other leads but they just dropped the ball and wanted the easy way out.’ Team effort: Villegas' supporters claim that he had inadequate legal representation during his trial and is innocent . Villegas’ first trial ended in hung jury, but in a second trial that took place in 1995, the panel came back with a guilty verdict, and he was sentenced to life in prison. Freddie Bonilla, the private detective who was hired by Villegas’ distant relative, has revealed that court-appointed attorney John Gates failed in his duties as a counselor, spending only 40 hours preparing for his client’s murder trial. Gates even signed an affidavit admitting that he had not done his best to argue Villegas' case. Joshua Tepfer, project director at the Center on Wrongful Convictions of Youth, told FoxNews.com evidence shows the murders were committed by brothers Rudy and Javier Flores, who allegedly told a witness Villegas was in jail for a crime they did. Family support: Villegas' parents have been fighting to get a retrial for their son where he would have a chance to prove his innocence . Javier Flores has since died and his surviving sibling is currently serving jail time on drug-related charges. However, El Paso Assistant District Attorney John Briggs said the jury in the second trial reached the correct verdict and dismissed Villegas' claims of ineffective counsel. ‘He has provided no new evidence, which is required for someone who is claiming actual innocence,’ Briggs said.","Daniel Villegas, 35, was convicted in 1995 of gunning down two men in a drive-by shooting .

"A man has been arrested on cannibalism charges in Papua New Guinea after he took his young daughter’s life by biting her neck and sucking out her blood. The three-year-old child's murder has shocked the country, which has become hardened to numerous cases of witchcraft and brutal killings. Police said the murder of the child had left the community all horrified and resulted in the local paper, The Post Courier, running a front page headline declaring: 'Vampire Father'. Terror in paradise: The man wrenched his daughter out of her mother's arms when they visited him in Morobe Province, pictured, and ran off with the little girl (stock image) The incident was described as 'a sickening act of cannibalism', a comment supported by police. The father, named as Rex Eric, from the Finschhafen District in Morobe Province, has been charged with cannibalism and wilful murder, although investigations are still continuing. Local councillor John Kenny, who was the first to reach the tragic scene, said the incident occurred after the mother and the child came to visit the father, from whom she is believed to be separated. 'He grabbed the baby girl from her, jumped over a fence and ran into bushes where he carried out this terrible thing,' said Mr Kenny. 'He held the baby close to him, bit deep into her neck, ate the flesh, sucked the blood,' he told the newspaper. Cannibalism: According to witnesses in Morobe, the father jumped over a fence and ran into nearby bushes where he ate bits of his daughter's flesh and drank her blood until she was dead (stock image) 'Two boys who were climbing coconut trees nearby saw him and ran quickly to the (nearby) settlement to alert the people. 'He was just laughing at the boys and continued eating the flesh and sucking the blood. 'The boys were scared and ran quickly to alert the people.' The baby girl's body was found where the father had dumped her in the bushes. The man ran towards a church seminary where other villagers grabbed him and handed him over to the authorities. Police said they believed the man was possessed - a claim not unusual in a country where sorcery and witchcraft are still practiced in remote areas.","Papua New Guinea father arrested on cannibalism charges .

"The Imperial Tobacco factory in Nottingham is to close, meaning the loss of more than 500 jobs and the end of the Britain's tobacco industry. Imperial's production plant and distribution centre, which dates back 137 years and produces tobacco for brands including Golden Virginia and Lambert & Butler, will shut with the loss of 540 jobs, it was announced yesterday. The cost-cutting decision - Imperial will move its production to other European factories - means the end of one of the last bastions of British manufacturing. To close: Imperial Tobacco is shutting its Nottingham plant with the loss of 540 jobs, the company announced . Imperial blamed 'tough economic conditions' for its decision to cut the Nottingham factory, pictured in 1939 . Cigarette production was a stalwart for cities across Britain, providing jobs for generation after generation, from its earliest introduction to the UK in the late 16th century. But for the last four decades, it has been an industry in decline.  Smoking peaked in the UK in 1974, and as smokers either cut down or gave up, with many switching to smoke-free e-cigarettes, manufacturers in Britain have steadily reduced their workforces. Now only Japan Tobacco International (JTI)'s Gallaher cigarette plant in Lisnafallan, Northern Ireland, remains. Imperial chief executive Alison Cooper said the Nottingham closures were part of a money-saving drive to save £300million a year from September 2018. She said: 'The prospect of job losses is always . regrettable and we will be doing all we can to support employees and . ensure that they are treated in a fair and responsible manner.' Imperial, which also makes Gauloises and Davidoff cigarettes, said cigarette production in . Europe was declining due to ‘tough economic conditions’, as well as . increased regulation, higher taxes and smuggling. Falling sales: Sales of cigarettes in the UK have plummeted by 42 per cent since 2000 (file picture) Tougher advertising regulations have made conditions harder for tobacco firms - this advert is from the 1930s . The company also announced the closure of sites in France including a factory in Nantes and a research and development facility in Bergerac, taking the total job losses to 900. The Nottingham and French plants will . close over the next two years, and production will be relocated to . factories in Germany and Poland, with distribution being outsourced. France's cigarette market has suffered . along with the rest of Europe, with sales almost half what they were in . 2000.  Cigarette sales in Britain have gone down by 42 per cent in the . same period. In the 1930s and 1940s, cigarette girls were a common sight in bars, restaurants, nightclubs and cinemas in Europe and the US. The girl made her living by catching a man's eye and selling him not only cigarettes but also matches, lighters, and novelty items. What she wore influenced how often she was called over, so cigarette girls tended to wear revealing or alluring clothes, such as a bodice, short tutu-style skirt, and high heels. Cigarette girls still work in some nightclubs and restaurants, but their heyday has now passed. Imperial, the world's fourth-largest international tobacco company by market share, aims to launch two electronic cigarettes this year. They are safer than traditional cigarettes but also face the prospect of additional government regulation. The company, which has 46 manufacturing sites and 35,000 staff in 160 countries, closed a cigar factory in Bristol in 2010. The . GMB union, which represents tobacco workers in Nottingham, said the . announcement was a devastating blow to the workforce and the city’s . economy. Union official . Chris Needham said: ‘GMB will oppose this closure as we believe the . work of producing 17billion cigarettes in Nottingham each year is being . migrated east to the Polish factory as a cynical ploy to increase . profits and for no other reason. ‘This . company made no less than £3.18billion profits last year and to make . even more money it is simply walking away from Nottingham. This is not . acceptable.’ Smoking is the biggest single cause of illness and premature death in the UK, and causes the death of 100,000 people in Britain every single year. First introduced to Britain in 1586 by colonists from Virginia in the US, tobacco was initially criticised by King James I who, in his 1602 pamphlet A Counterblaste To Tobacco, claimed that smoking was a sin. But despite his best attempts, the popularity of tobacco spread, and its alleged health-giving powers meant it was sold not only at taverns but at chemists, too. It rose in fashion during the 17th and 18th centuries, and duty on tobacco rose accordingly as the Government came to value tobacco excise as a valuable source of income. Big employer: The Wills cigarette firm in Bristol began in 1786 and employed thousands of men and women . With the tobacco being imported from overseas, major ports such as London, Bristol, Liverpool and Glasgow became centres of the cigarette manufacturing industry. In Bristol, Wills & Co - founded in 1786 - was one of the biggest tobacco firms, and one of the first to make cigarettes.  As the firm grew, so did the number of people it employed, and the company pioneered worker benefits such as health care, paid holidays and canteens. Liverpool had the Ogden Tobacco Company,  while in Glasgow two 'tobacco lairds', William Glassford and William Cunninghame, made a fortune importing tobacco from the colonies. Imperial's history in Nottingham dates back to 1877, when John Player bought a small tobacco manufacturing business in Broad Marsh. It has been at its current site in the city since 1972. Women, such as these at an Imperial Tobacco factory in the 1930s, were often hired by tobacco firms . In 1876 Benson & Hedges received its first royal warrant from Edward, Prince of Wales, and by the 1880s, tobacco manufacturers in London alone were estimated to make up a quarter of all the manufacturers in Britain. In 1902 British American Tobacco (BAT) was formed as a joint venture between Britain's Imperial Tobacco Company and the American Tobacco Company.  But ten years later, the first connection was made between smoking and lung cancer by a Doctor I Adler. It didn't stop cigarettes being included in soldiers' ration packs during the First World War, though, while manufacturer Philip Morris started targeting women with their cigarette advertising in 1925. Cigarette adverts: British-made Player's used a cherubic toddler before health warnings became mandatory . By the 1950s, medical studies found a definite link between smoking and lung cancer, and by 1971 all packets of cigarettes sold in the UK had to carry health warnings. The first National No Smoking Day was organised in 1989, and in July 2007 a ban on smoking in pubs, bars, restaurants and all enclosed workplace came into force. Cigarette sales, which peaked in Britain in 1974, fell from 94.4billion in the UK in 1991 to 55.5billion in 2001 and 42billion in 2011 thanks to increased awareness of associated health risks, as well at tighter advertising regulations and higher tax. Initially included in cigarette packs to stiffen the packaging, cigarette cards soon became desirable in their own right as people sought to collect full sets. While early versions simply bore the cigarette manufacturer's logo or name, they were soon released in thematic sets, with, for example, famous footballers or battleships drawn on them. This set of cigarette cards depicting Kings and Queens of England was produced by Carreras in 1935 . In Britain, the Bristol-based Wills firm introduced cigarette cards first, in 1887, followed by John Player & Sons in 1893 and Liverpool's Ogden a couple of years after that. Cards typically came in sets of 25 or 50, and complete sets would sell for large sums at specialist auctions, with collectors paying up to £11,000 for a single, rare card.","Imperial Tobacco is to close its plant at Nottingham in cost-cutting drive .

"Fashion designer Alexander McQueen loathed Victoria Beckham and 'barred her from his catwalk show because he thought she was stupid', a new tell-all book claims. The British designer, who committed suicide aged 40 in 2010, apparently banned the former pop star from wearing his clothes and turned down the chance to have her attend his catwalk show. McQueen's supposed animosity towards the established fashion designer has been outlined in Gods And Kings, a revelatory biography of McQueen and his rival, John Galliano, by Dana Thomas. Scroll down for video . British fashion designer Alexander McQueen (left), who died aged 40 in 2010, apparently banned Victoria Beckham (pictured right wearing a McQueen tartan skirt) from attending his 2001 collection show in London . Its release comes as Mrs Beckham, who has four children with husband David, continues to receive rave reviews for her latest fashion collection at New York Fashion Week. The book recalls McQueen's 2001 Voss collection show at the bus depot in Victoria, London, and reveals how it started late because actress Gwyneth Paltrow was stuck in traffic. McQueen allegedly said the show could not start until she arrived. However, author and journalist Ms Thomas claims in her book that the former Spice Girl, 40, didn't receive such treatment. She writes: 'Not all celebrities were so lucky — or respected — chez McQueen. Victoria Beckham asked to attend and he turned her down.' She claims he said: 'F****** right. At the end of the day, it's about my clothes and the hard work that everyone backstage puts into it, not about the t***** sitting in the front row lapping it up. 'And that's why I didn't let Posh Spice come to it… The stars you see at my shows, be it Gwyneth Paltrow, be it anyone else, are there because I've got a connection with them… [I design for] intelligent women.' It has also previously been claimed that McQueen was furious when he saw photographs of Mrs Beckham wearing his classic tartan skirt in 2006. In July last year, fashion stylist Archie Reed, who was McQueen's lover – on and off – for 12 years and his closest confidant, revealed that McQueen had 'exploded in fury' after seeing the picture. McQueen (left), who was found dead at his Mayfair home aged 40 in February 2010, reportedly delayed his 2001 Voss collection show in London because actress Gwyneth Paltrow (right) was stuck in traffic . The designer counted a host of famous faces among his friends including Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss . He told the Mail: 'He said: ""David can wear my clothes but she can't."" 'He thought David was hot, but he couldn't abide Victoria. After he saw her in his tartans he put out the word that she wasn't allowed to get any freebies any more. 'Lee didn't rate her as a fashion designer at all and used to say: ""What the f*** does she know about fashion? She's a pop star, and she can't even sing."" 'No matter how famous he was, he always used to say that celebrity and celebrities didn't matter to him at all.' However, despite the late fashion designer's apparent animosity towards Mrs Beckham, she has never hinted at any feud and gave a touching tribute to McQueen when he passed away. Following his death on February 10, 2010, which came just eight days after his mother Joyce passed away from kidney failure, Mrs Beckham said: 'Today, the fashion industry has lost a true great. An icon of all time. He made all he touched beautiful and will be desperately missed. 'McQueen was a master of fashion, creative genius and an inspiration. 'My heart is very much with his family and friends at this very sad time.'

"New York Times media columnist David Carr was remembered for his candid words, journalistic talent and 'unique combination of Minnesota nice and New York attitude' at a funeral mass on Tuesday. Hundreds of mourners, ranging from Carr's relatives and colleagues to celebrities, paid their respects to the 58-year-old writer at the service at Manhattan's Church of St. Ignatius Loyola. In attendance were Girls actress Lena Dunham, comedians Stephen Colbert and Tom Arnold, writer Gay Talese and the Times's publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr and executive editor, Dean Baquet. During the mass, Carr's daughters, Meagan, Erin and Maddie, joined by his widow, Jill Rooney Carr, paid tribute to their father, who died last Thursday after collapsing in the Times's newsroom. Scroll down for video . Emotional: New York Times media columnist David Carr's three daughters (l-r), Maddie, Erin and Meagan, paid tribute to their talented, devoted and 'curious' father at a funeral mass in Manhattan, New York, on Tuesday . Service: Hundreds of mourners, ranging from Carr's relatives and colleagues to celebrities, remembered the 58-year-old revered writer at the service (pictured) at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola in the Upper East Side . Missed: Carr (pictured on the day of his death) died last Thursday after collapsing in the Times's newsroom . Meagan said she did not expect to meet 'another person who touched as many people as my dad did', while Erin remembered her father as 'a curious sort who wanted to know about everything'. Meanwhile, Carr’s older brother, John, said the columnist was a mixture of 'Minnesota nice and New York attitude', adding that it had 'never occurred to us that we would say goodbye in this church'. He noted that former New York Governor Mario Cuomo and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis were among the famous names to have been posthumously honored at the Upper East Side venue. Before the service got underway, mourners were handed a funeral program featuring a quote from Carr, who battled crack cocaine addiction and alcoholism before joining the Times in 2002. 'I’m ecstatic in my own dark, morbid way and subscribe to the theory of the past that allows the future to unfold: We all did the best we could,' the quote read, according to the New York Daily News. Dressed in black, the attendees then took their seats and listened to a homily from Rev James Martin, who described Carr, from New Jersey, as 'a complicated man' who had faith as well as doubts. In his own words: Before the service got underway, mourners were handed a funeral program featuring a quote from Carr (pictured), who battled drug addiction and alcoholism before joining the Times in 2002 . Colleague: Times business columnist Nick Bilton posted a picture of the program to Twitter on Tuesday . Family: Carr lived with his wife, Jill Rooney Carr (left), and daughter Maddie (right) in Montclair, New Jersey . According to the Times, he declared he did not want to 'claim him as a kind of prize for the church, or trumpet his faith, or even point to him as the model Catholic or the model Christian; he wasn’t.' 'But, then again, no one is,” Father Martin added. 'All of us are imperfect, flawed, even sinful.' The funeral came a day after a wake was held for Carr at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, during which family, friends and other mourners cried and laughed as they remembered the columnist. During the wake, also in the Upper East Side, Carr's daughter Eric told attendees: 'I loved my dad, I loved him so much. I am so sad that he’s not here. But, good lord, he would have loved this!' Speaking with a smile, she added: 'My dad was a crazy one'. Meanwhile, Dunham said  she had recently asked Carr about the future of the Times and he had said 'he’d stay with it until it ran straight to the ground', according to a tweet from writer Tad Friend. Mourners: In attendance were Girls actress Lena Dunham (left), comedians Stephen Colbert and Tom Arnold, writer Gay Talese and the Times's publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr (right) and executive editor, Dean Baquet . Old notebooks: The funeral came a day after a wake was held for Carr at Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, during which Jill Rooney Carr handed out the father-of-three's old yellow reporter’s notebooks to mourners . Another media attendee: On Tuesday, CNN correspondent Brian Stelter, who attended the wake, tweeted: 'At the wake tonight, David's widow Jill handed out these: reporter's notebooks from his stash at home' The 28-year-old actress later took to Twitter herself, writing: 'You would have loved your wake, David. You DID love your wake. Laughter, tears, your beautiful girl gang family in the front row.' During the service, Carr’s wife, Jill, handed out the father-of-three's old yellow reporter’s notebooks to mourners, according to a tweet by CNN correspondent Brian Stelter, who was also in attendance. She then joined the columnists' daughters at the front of the chapel, where a huge black-and-white head shot of Carr beaming was propped against vases filled with lilies, the Daily Beast reported. Alongside, the photos were two of Carr's pocket-sized reporter's notebooks, as well as one of his beloved cans of Diet Coke which had replaced his addiction to the drug of the same name, it is said. Comedians: Stephen Colbert (left) and Tom Arnold (right) both attended Tuesday's funeral mass for Carr . Discussion: Before his death, Carr had expertly moderated a discussion on 'Citizenfour', a film about Edward J. Snowden and his leaking of documents about government surveillance. Above, Carr (left) at the discussion . Mourners were informed of Carr's penchant for dancing. One man, who only identified himself as Michael, said he had become close to the writer after meeting him at an AA meeting. 'If you haven’t seen David dance, it’s amazing,' he l recounted. 'I can’t tell if he’s the worst dancer I’ve ever seen or the best dancer I’ve ever seen. But he’s the least insecure dancer I’ve ever seen.' Last Saturday, an autopsy revealed that Carr, who lived with his event planner wife and youngest daughter Maddie in Montclair, New Jersey, died of complications from metastatic lung cancer. Julie Bolcer, a spokeswoman for the New York City medical examiner's office, said the autopsy also showed that heart disease had contributed to the acclaimed columnist's death. Church: Carr’s older brother, John, said the columnist was a mixture of 'Minnesota nice and New York attitude', adding that it had 'never occurred to us that we would say goodbye in this church'. He noted that former New York Governor Mario Cuomo was posthumously honored at theSt Ignatius Loyola Church (pictured) Before joining the Times, Carr was a contributing writer for The Atlantic Monthly and New York magazine. He also was a media writer for news website Inside.com. Carr served as editor of the Washington City Paper, an alternative weekly in Washington, D.C. He also was editor of a Minneapolis-based alternative weekly called Twin Cities Reader. Throughout his career, he was well known for writing about his personal life. In 2008, he penned a memoir, The Night of the Gun, in which he detailed his struggles with cocaine addiction.

"Actress Jane Fonda, 76, revealed to an audience of activists and philanthropists on Sunday that her mother had been sexually abused and eventually committed suicide. Fonda made the personal revelation as she hosted an event celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Rape Treatment Center, which provides comprehensive free treatment for sexual assault victims. The  annual fundraising brunch was held at billionaire Ron Burkle's Greenacres estate in Beverly Hills. Scroll down for video . Personal: Jane Fonda opened up about her mother's suicide at the Rape Foundation Brunch at Greenacres in Beverly Hills on Sunday . Fonda said she discovered while writing her memoirs that her mother had been sexually abused as a girl. Fonda said she reviewed her mother's medical records and discovered she had been sexually abused when she was 8 years old. Frances Ford Seymour committed suicide when Fonda was 12. 'The minute that I read that, everything fell into place,' Fonda said from a small stage set up in Burkle's sprawling backyard. 'I knew why the promiscuity, the endless plastic surgery, the guilt, the inability to love or be intimate, and I was able to forgive her and forgive myself.' Fonda explained that learning this helped her understand some of her mother's behavior before her ultimate suicide when Fonda was 12. She said sexual violence is ‘epidemic’ vowing, ‘I will support the Rape Treatment Center for the rest of my life.’ Lily Tomlin introduced Fonda, her ‘9 to 5’ co-star and longtime friend. David Schwimmer and Eric McCormack also spoke during the luncheon, where guests included Viola Davis, Emmy Rossum and Sam Waterson.

Flashback: Henry and Frances pictured during filming of Wings Of The Morning at Denham in 1936 - Frances later committed suicide when her daughter Jane was only 12 years old . Gail Abarbanel, founder of the Rape Treatment Center and president of the Rape Foundation, introduced several rape survivors, including the mother of the victim of the 2012 Steubenville High School assault in Ohio. She noted her daughter’s bravery in pressing charges against her attackers — beloved star football players who had the support of the community. Schwimmer and McCormack asked the deep-pocketed in the crowd for their support, and five people — including Burkle — spontaneously gave $100,000 to help the Rape Treatment Center continue to offer free medical, psychological and legal services to children and adults. The Rape Foundation also provides free training for first responders and sexual assault prevention programs nationwide. The Barbarella star was her usual stylish self while at the event in a lilac tunic with dolman sleeves and a peplum with an asymmetric hem at the hip, decorated with a gold bar across her perfectly flat tummy. She teamed it with matching trousers and peep toe shoes. The double Oscar-winning actress carried a small silver clutchbag and accessorised with a short necklace of square, amber-coloured stones. Her layered blonde tresses framed her face, which was delicately made up with a hint of pink blush and lipstick that exactly matched the colour of her outfit. Springtime in fall: Fonda wore a beautiful lilac-coloured two piece . Fabulous figure: The 76-year-old showed off her slender shape in the elegant ensemble . And Jane protected her eyes with cool lilac-lensed shades. The star met up with an old friend and fellow septuagenarian at the event, actress Lily Tomlin. The brunette, who also looked much younger than her 76 years, wore a black, short-sleeved blouse and trousers with a diaphanous jacket over the top. Septuagenarians: Jane met up with and old friend, Lily Tomline, who is also 76, at the event . Nearly one in five women in the U.S. has been raped, 80% before the age of 25, while one in six boys is sexually abused before the age of 18, according to the Rape Foundation. Founded in 1989, the organisation brings state-of-the-art care to rape victims and sexually abused children, provides prevention programs to reduce the incidence of these crimes and trains victim service providers to enhance the treatment victims receive wherever they turn to the Foundation for help.

"Parents and civil rights activists are furious at the new program that will allow school administrators to monitor the heart rates, exercise, and sleep schedules of students using electronic bracelets. A school district in Long Island, New York, announced that it would be the latest addition to the list of schools using the technology to help track students' activity and fight obesity. Unanswered questions- including which students will wear the devices, for how long, and the purpose of the gathered data- have parents concerned about the level to which the program will invade their children's privacy. Working it out: Long Island students are going to be the latest to wear electronic monitoring watches to help track their physical activity throughout the day . Ten Polar Active monitoring bracelets . were ordered by the Bay Shore athletic department and will be used . throughout the district in the coming semester. When students wear the watch-like monitors, their heart beats and motion patterns are uploaded onto hand held computers by teachers. That data is then stored into a collection displayed on a password-protected site. Parents and teachers should have access to the site, though it is unknown how or if the identity of the chosen students will be revealed. The system has been used in school districts in New Jersey and Missouri already, where parents and civil rights advocates were among the most vocal critics. 'When you get into monitoring people’s biological vital signs, that’s a pretty intrusive measurement,' said American Civil Liberties Union spokesman Jay Stanley. The root of the riot: The Polar monitors track heart rate and sleep time . 'A program like this should only be voluntary. Nobody should be forced to reveal biological indicator,' Mr Stanley told The New York Post. Little is known how the ten monitors- each of which cost $90- will be spread throughout the seven schools in the Bay Shore school district, or whether students will volunteer or be chosen to participate. One parent whose child wore the device in his St. Louis elementary school said that she never gave consent and was not privy to the results, both of which she found problematic. 'I didn't even know it was going on, and I'm active in the school. We have gotten no information about the website security or where the data will go,' Beth Huebner told The Post. When they were used in the Parkway School District in Chersterfield, Missouri, some parents were concerned that the data collected by having third, fourth and fifth graders wearing the monitors was not just being used during the school day but also during private family time. 'I feel they're getting into privacy issues, into people's personal lives, when they have to be worn at home,' said parent and the parent-teacher organization president Cara Bauer. 'That kind of makes me a little leery, and though I think the monitors are a fantastic idea in school, I don't want that at home,' Ms Bauer continued. Trying it out: The Bay Shore School District includes seven different schools, and so far it isn't known how the 10 monitors will be divided . By displaying the childrens' heart rates and showing how little or much they are active throughout the day, proponents argue that it promotes an interest and awareness of their own efforts. 'Heart Rate Monitors play a crucial part in how physical educators can not only assess in their classes, but how we educate students about how their bodies react to everything they do,' said Hank Speerstra, a Polar representative. 'Having data that drives how we create our curriculums is critical to helping students learn how to take care of themselves,' he continued while talking about the New Jersey program. New York is ranked the 16 worst state in the country in terms of childhood obesity, with 17.1 per cent of children considered officially obese in July. By comparison, the two other states who have used the monitors- Missouri and New Jersey- are both better off as they are ranked 31st and 21st respectively.

"Paying cash in hand is ‘diddling’ the economy and depriving schools and  hospitals of money, the  country’s top taxman said last night. Dave Hartnett, permanent secretary for tax at HM Revenue and Customs, called on people to report those they believed were evading tax. He said paying a builder or cleaner in cash, allowing them to evade VAT or income tax, would result in even deeper Government cuts to public services. Taxman: Paying cash in hand is 'diddling' the economy and depriving schools and  hospitals of money . Those who contribute to the black economy cannot then complain about austerity measures, he added. HMRC has come in for stinging criticism in recent weeks for alleged ‘sweetheart’ deals with big firms such as Vodafone, allowing them to avoid paying millions of pounds in tax. But Mr Hartnett denied the charge. He added: ‘Tax provides the funding to run the country: hospitals, schools and everything else. Every time someone pays cash in order not to pay VAT, the nation gets diddled.’ He said there would be a crackdown on the very rich who do not pay their fair share, with loopholes used by such people closed. And he encouraged anyone who suspects wrongdoing to telephone the Revenue’s whistle-blower hotline and tip off inspectors. ‘Cash has been a problem for a long time. The people who are worried about it should use our whistle-blowing line to tell us,’ he said. ‘We are getting better and better at finding people who receive cash. The HMRC says those who contribute to the black economy by not paying tax cannot then complain about austerity measures . ‘There are loopholes for wealthy people which have got to be closed down. We have not yet got the same head of steam up, addressing those loopholes as we have with business loopholes, but we will be there soon.’ He said HMRC aimed to increase its number of prosecutions for wilful non-payment six-fold, to 1,200 next year. MPs last month accused Mr Hartnett of being ‘unduly cosy’ with big companies and of applying double standards to corporations and ordinary taxpayers. It was alleged he agreed deals with companies including Goldman Sachs and Vodafone that allegedly let them off large bills worth millions of pounds.  But Mr Hartnett claimed the Revenue’s ‘engagement policy’ with businesses had persuaded them to pay £25 billion in tax over the past six years which they otherwise would not have done. ‘We are not soft with big business; there was no sweetheart deal with Vodafone,’ he said. ‘We got all the money for the nation that was there to be got.’ He said the controversy has unfairly damaged the image of HMRC. ‘It has also done a huge disservice to the country. My own people are now more wary about how they engage with large corporate taxpayers, and large corporate taxpayers don’t want to end up on your front page,’ he said. Mr Hartnett said there was once a culture in large companies for tax avoidance which is now widespread among well-heeled individuals. HMRC is starting a campaign to target tens of thousands of cash-in-hand builders and other prosperous people who used to pay tax at the top rate but have now stopped. Previous operations have homed in on home tutors, plumbers and eBay traders, and have pulled in an extra £500million in tax since 2007. Mr Hartnett, who is retiring this summer after 36 years at the department, denied he had been forced to retire and said he had been getting ‘a lot of offers’ of work. He added: ‘If I have been forced out no one has told me. I am 61 next month, I have been leading tax in this department for 12 years, it is time for someone else to have a go at it.’","HMRC calls on people to report people evading tax .

"California's requirement of 'microstamping' technology means that no guns manufactured after 2013 have been sold in the state, known as having some of the strictest gun control laws. Now gun-rights groups are hoping that a federal judge will overturn the provision that gun manufacturers have blamed for ceasing gun sales. Fox News reports that the Calguns Foundation and Second Amendment Foundation are eagerly awaiting a decision on microstamping requirements they say are effectively banning firearm sales. Stamped: Microstamping uses laser-engraved codes on firing pins to trace a shell casing to the gun that fired the bullet, though studies are inconclusive on its effectiveness . The request for California Eastern District Judge Kimberly Mueller to stop the state from enforcing a law on microstamping is the latest in a legal battle that began in 2009 over the state's 'Handgun Roster.' 'This is about the state trying to eliminate the handgun market,' said Alan Gura, the lead attorney in the lawsuit against the Chief of the California Department of Justice Bureau of Firearms. 'The evidence submitted by the manufacturers shows this is science fiction and there is not a practical way to implement the law.' Microstamping utilizes lasers to engrave an alphanumeric code on the parts of the weapon such as the firing pin, which is transferred to a shell casing when the gun is fired. A 2008 study from the forensic science program at UC Davis found that the codes on the face of the firing pin often transferred legibly, though codes on the edges wore down with repeated use. Fred Tulleners, then-director of the forensic science graduate program at UC Davis, said at the time that the technology would cost between $6 and $7 to implement, but that more research was needed. Patented technology: Todd Lizotte, who patented microstamping technology, has agreed to let his patents expire, a prerequisite for the technology being mandated by California's gun laws . California's requirement that handguns carry the technology, which was patented in the 1990s, stipulated that the technology be feasible and all private patents are expired, SF Gate reported. Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer, who introduced the bill that enacted the microstamping requirement as a state assemblyman, said the technology could identify the firearm in 45 percent of unsolved gun crimes. 'When we know who bought the crime gun, that’s a significant lead for law enforcement,' Feuer said. Firearms manufacturers have not been warm to the new technology, which proponents say could replace or complement ballistic fingerprinting, a century-old method of identifying a firearm used in a shooting. Two gun manufacturers, Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger & Co, blamed the microstamping requirement when they announced last year they would stop selling guns in California. Smith & Wesson, though, is still selling certain models, such as the M&P Shield pistol, grandfathered in on the state's Handgun Roster of legal firearms. In the view of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, such as Gene Hoffman, co-founder of Calguns Foundation, with gunmakers backing out of the state, the law is a de facto ban on firearm sales. 'Any new semi-automatic gun that we want to carry for self defense or purchase as collectors will not be available to us at all,' Hoffman said.","The law prohibits the sale of handguns without technology that transfers an alphanumeric on the shell casing .
Plantiffs in a lawsuit before the California Eastern District Court say since gunmakers won't make 'microstamping' guns, the law is a de facto ban .

Researchers believe the technology could cost under $10 per gun .

"A family from hell who terrorised their neighbours for more than two years have become the first in Britain to be evicted from their home under a new anti-social behaviour law. Caroline Beck and her four children were accused of deliberately setting fires, criminal damage, illegal use of off-road motorbikes, and persistent noise nuisance. Cleveland Police say they are the first force in the country to use the new Anti-Social Behaviour Crime and Policing Act 2014 in order to evict the family from their home in South Bank, Middlesbrough, solely on grounds of anti-social behaviour. The force said Ms Beck and her children, aged between 12 and 21 years, made their neighbours' lives hell for more than two years. Caroline Beck and her four children are believed to be the first family to be evicted under a new anti-social behaviour law. Pictured: Rubbish has been left strewn across the garden of the family's former home in South Bank, Middlesbrough . Before going to the courts officers had been forced to set up a problem solving group just to deal with the family. Along with social housing landlords, the council and the fire brigade the  force applied to have the family evicted after the situation failed to improve. Teesside Magistrates' Court granted the order after being presented with a catelogue of evidence against the family, included CCTV  covertly gathered of them behaving badly. The home has now been boarded up by the authorities preventing the family from returning. Sergeant Steve Chambers, a neighborhood officer, said the force was 'delighted' that the the closure notice has been approved. Ms Beck, 39,  said: 'To say we've made our neighbours' lives hell is disgusting . 'As neighbourhood police officers, we work to ensure our communities are safe places to live and work without the fear of crime, harassment and ASB which can blight the lives of the law abiding majority. 'The ruling should send out a very clear message that police and partners will not tolerate persistent antisocial behaviour and criminality and we will use every tool at our disposal to deal with anyone taking part in this.' But Ms Beck, 39, attacked the move to oust her and her 12-year-old daughter Billy-Jo and sons Dan, 21, Arron, 19 and Mark,15,  from their double-fronted home. 'To say we've made our neighbours' lives hell is disgusting,' she said. 'My neighbours, 99% of them, have said our eviction is a disgrace. 'People are saying my kids are causing all this anti-social behaviour? There's a youth club and a skate park just around the corner. When they clear out, all the kids gather on the corner near my house. 'None of my kids have criminal records, three of them have qualifications, one of them's a prefect at school. How can they be named for anti-social behaviour?' 'I've lived at that house for 12 years. All that mess outside is what has happened when we were evicted. People will think that's how we had it when we lived there - that's not true. 'The powers used to evict us have only been in force since last year. They've used us like guinea pigs.' PC Mark O'Hagan outside the boarded up home after Teesside Magistrates Court granted the closures order . In October last year new powers were introduced to make it easier and quicker to evict nuisance neighbours from rented homes. It previously took an average of seven months to get a possession order. The new 'fast-track' eviction process  enables private and social landlords to evict tenants who are guilty of persistent or serious anti-social behaviour . Under the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014, landlords can apply to the courts to evict tenants on five grounds. These include when a tenant has been convicted of a serious offence, criminal behaviour or an anti-social behaviour order, or has breached a noise abatement notice. Under the new powers tenants convicted of breaching noise abatement orders could be forced out within two weeks of a court hearing. Anyone convicted of riot-related offences will also face fast-track eviction. When the new law was announced Housing Minister Brandon Lewis said:'No one deserves to feel intimidated or unsafe in their own community, yet lengthy court proceedings have left nightmare tenants free to cause misery for their neighbours for years. 'But from today, new powers mean landlords can take swifter action to evict any tenant convicted of persistent or serious anti-social behaviour, bringing faster relief to victims and witnesses. 'It will mean law-abiding social tenants will be able to live in peace, while anyone found guilty of serious anti-social behaviour cannot benefit from the valuable support that social housing can offer.'","Caroline Beck and her children evicted from their home in Middlesbrough .

"The son of a well-known Chinese general has been charged with taking part in a gang rape. Li Tianyi, 17, and four other men will face trial over the attack, which allegedly took place at a Beijing hotel in February. Li is the son of Li Shuangjiang, 74, one of China’s most famous military leaders, who has reportedly fallen ill as a result of his son’s arrest. Baby-faced: Li Tianyi, 17, and four other men will face trial over the attack in Beijing . If convicted, the baby-faced teenager could serve from three to 10 years, although the law allows for harsher punishment if the case is considered especially serious. His father Li Shuangjiang is a general famed for singing patriotic anthems for the People's Liberation Army and often stars in television galas. He was reportedly taken ill after his son was arrested, and was further shamed when evidence emerged that he may have lied about his son’s age to give him a lenient sentence. Father and son: Li Tianyi (right) is son of Li Shuangjiang (left), a general in the Chinese army who is famed for singing Chinese patriotic anthems . The rape charges aren't the younger Li's first brush with the law. He was sentenced to a year in detention in 2011 as a 15-year-old for attacking a couple over a minor traffic dispute and threatening onlookers, in a case that attracted widespread condemnation online. Spoiled: Li Shuangjiang, was forced to make a public apology for failing to check his son's bad behavior . He sent to a detention centre for a year after being convicted of assaulting a couple in the street who blocked the path of the BMW he was driving. Li was ridiculed in the media as a spoiled brat and his father was forced to make a public apology for failing to check his son's bad behavior. Now a video has emerged, published by South China Morning Post, showing General Li referring to his 12 year old son in 2006, meaning his son is now 19 and should then possibly have been tried as an adult in the 2010 incident. It appears he will be tried as an adult in the gang rape case, but the prosecutor’s office in Beijing's Haidian district could not confirm this. Amid anger over corruption and a widening wealth gap, many Chinese have become increasingly impatient with the antics of the ‘wealthy second generation’ seen as using their parents' money and connections to avoid repercussions for illegal or outrageous behavior.","Li Tianyi, 17, and four others stand accused of rape .

"A father allegedly strangled his three young daughters and threw their bodies in a canal because he feared he could never afford to pay for their weddings. Sanjay Dubey, 33, was arrested at the scene in India where he admitted killing his children because he was penniless. He told his wife he was taking his girls to a local fair while she stayed at home to cook dinner. Instead the sari trader from Pandesera, in Gujarat, western India, led his daughters Ankita, nine, Priya, seven, and two-year-old Bhavna, to a canal where he strangled each one late last Friday. Seven-year-old Priya Dubey (left) and her nine-year-old sister Ankita (right) were killed along with their other sibling, two-year-old Bhavna, by their father because he feared he could never afford to fund their weddings . Sanjay Dubey (centre) was arrested by a canal where he had strangled his three daughters before throwing their bodies in the water. He was reportedly suffering depression after losing £3,000 in a business deal . Inspector Mahendra Kher said: 'We received a call on Saturday morning from a villager who had found three bodies floating face down in a canal. 'When we reached the spot we found Sanjay already present and he quickly confessed to killing his daughters.' Sanjay had apparently been fighting depression after losing Rs 3 Lakh (£3,000) in a business deal a few months ago. He brazenly told police that he had no other choice, but to kill is daughters because he was worried about the costs of raising them. His wife Meera Devi, 32 said: 'My girls were very excited that night. Sanjay had told them he was going to buy them some new clothes at the market and they were very excited. 'They all left on the family motorbike at 6pm and I carried on preparing dinner. 'But when they didn't return after 10pm, I started making frantic calls to Sanjay but his phone was switched off. 'I was crying hysterically all night. I didn't sleep for one second. I thought they had been in an awful accident or something.' Police found the body of two-year-old Bhavna (above) floating in the water when they arrested her father . Horrific: The bodies of Ankita, nine, and Priya, seven, were also found in the canal . The next morning her husband's brother told Meera that her daughters had been killed by their father. But Meera, who had delivered two stillborn sons before the birth of her daughters, claims Sanjay never pressured her for a son. 'I do not know why he killed the girls. I have no idea, it's so out of character,' she said. 'He loved them very much. Our daughters were our world. He had always been a very loving father.' Many families in India see daughters as an economic burden because they have to worry about wedding costs and a huge dowry. Many even resent spending on girls' school fees because they believe there is no point as women will only stay at home. While many parents kill their unborn female babies, some resort to killing their daughters much later in life. With a population of 1.27billion, India has only 943 females for 1000 males, which has long been a concern for Indian governments. To generate awareness to save future daughters and empower women, the new government has launched its ambitious Beti Bachao, Beti Padao (Save Girl Child, Educate Girl Child) scheme.","Sanjay Dubey, 33, admitted killing his three children because he was broke .

"It might not be the most stunning image to come out of space, but this picture has got astronomers very excited. This misshapen circle and accompanying dot are the first ever image to be taken of a planet orbiting a star over 63 light years from Earth. If light travels 5.88 trillion miles in a single year, then this is an image of a planet 370.44 trillion miles away. Gemini Planet Imager's first light image of Beta Pictoris b, a planet orbiting the star Beta Pictoris. The star, Beta Pictoris, is blocked in this image by a mask so its light doesn't interfere with the light of the planet. Beta Pictoris b is a giant planet - several times larger than Jupiter - and is approximately ten million years old . The image was taken by the world's most powerful planet-hunting instrument, the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI), and is of a 10-million-year-old planet named Beta Pictorus b. Gemini has been under development for nearly a decade, but this is only the first image to be released by the instrument. Scientists claim it is the most advanced such instrument to be deployed on one of the world’s biggest telescopes – the eight-meter Gemini South telescope in Chile. ‘Even these early first-light images are almost a factor of 10 better than the previous generation of instruments,’ said Bruce Macintosh of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who led the team that built the instrument. Gemini's first light of the young star HR4796A. The left image shows normal light, including both the dust ring and the residual light from the central star. The right image shows only polarised light. Leftover starlight is unpolarised and hence removed from this image making it clearer . The Gemini Planet Imager is the world's most advanced planet hunting instrument built for the Gemini Telescope in Chile. It is designed to image extrasolar planets orbiting nearby stars. In 2011, the GPI Exoplanet Survey team was selected to carry out an 890-hour survey campaign from 2014 to 2016 to search and characterise exoplanets around 600 stars. GPI, which is the size of a small car, . detects infrared radiation from young Jupiter-like planets in wide . orbits around other stars, equivalent to the giant planets in our own solar system not long after their formation. It does this using silicon microchip deformable mirrors to remove atmospheric turbulence, and something known as coronagraphic masks - a telescopic attachment designed to block out the direct light from a star so that nearby objects. ‘In one minute, we are seeing planets that used to take us an hour to detect.’ GPI, which is the size of a small car, detects infrared radiation from young Jupiter-like planets in wide orbits around other stars, equivalent to the giant planets in our own Solar System not long after their formation. ‘Most planets that we know about to date are only known because of indirect methods that tell us a planet is there, a bit about its orbit and mass, but not much else,’ said Professor Macintosh. ‘With GPI we directly image planets around stars – it’s a bit like being able to dissect the system and really dive into the planet’s atmospheric makeup and characteristics.’ For GPI’s first observations, the team targeted previously known planetary systems, including the well-known Beta Pictoris system. They were also able to detect starlight scattered by tiny particles to study a faint ring of dust orbiting the very young star HR4796A 200 lights years from Earth. This dust ring which may be the debris remaining from planet formation and with previous instruments, only the edges of it could be seen. Although GPI was designed to look at distant planets, it can also observe objects in our solar system. This image of Jupiter’s moon Europa, for instance, can allow scientists to map changes in the satellite’s surface composition. A comparison of Europa observed with Gemini Planet Imager on the right and a composite map made from Galileo SSI and Voyager 1 and 2 data on the left . ‘Seeing a planet close to a star after just one minute, was a thrill, and we saw this on only the first week after the instrument was put on the telescope,’ said Fredrik Rantakyro a Gemini staff scientist working on the instrument. ‘Imagine what it will be able to do once we tweak and completely tune its performance.’ This year, the GPI team will begin a large-scale survey, looking at 600 young stars to see what giant planets orbit them. Looking through Earth’s turbulent atmosphere, even with advanced adaptive optics, GPI will only be able to see Jupiter-sized planets. But similar technology is being proposed for future space telescopes. Professor Macintosh predicts that ‘someday, there will be an instrument that will look a lot like GPI, on a telescope in space. ‘And the images and spectra that will come out of that instrument will show a little blue dot that is another Earth.’ Gemini has been under development for nearly a decade, but this is only the first image to be released by the instrument.

"A British self-proclaimed freedom fighter accused of illegally marrying up to 12 women in Europe and Asia is being investigated by Malaysian Special Branch officers, it was revealed today. Police have named the traveller as Robert Andrew Scott, but say he also uses the Muslim name Jamaluddin Mustafa and is usually seen in Islamic robes. Now understood to be living on the Malaysian island of Penang, 43-year-old Scott has been accused by women who have come forward to the police of duping his wives into caring for him, taking their money, then moving on to another woman. Investigation: Robert Andrew Scott, who also uses the Muslim name Jamaluddin Mustafa, is accused of illegally marrying up to 12 women in Europe and Asia . Special Branch assistant director-general Ayob Pitchay has told Malaysian media that most of the women targeted by Scott were professionals such as bank officers and university lecturers. Mr Pitchay said he understood that Scott was once involved in a missionary movement in London and had joined a mujahiddin - freedom fighters - group in Bosnia. The officer said he had learned of a report that Scott had been held for the murder of a doctor in Bosnia but family members - it is not known which family - had successfully filed an application for his release. 'While he has been involved in militant work in Bosnia, he has not shown such tendencies while in Malaysia,' said Mr Pitchay. 'We are monitoring his marriages and what his real motives are,' said Mr Pitchay, confirming that Scott's alleged wives were of several different nationalities. Two that he had divorced recently were said to be Malaysian. Revealed: Police say Scott was once involved in a missionary movement in London and had joined a mujahiddin - freedom fighters - group in Bosnia . Writers who have come forward anonymously on Facebook allege that the exact number of his wives is unknown because Scott never divorces them officially through the authorities. 'Some victims truly believe there are more than 10,' claimed one writer, who described Scott as a 'heretical and deviant Muslim’. Further claims against Scott say that he is a 'manipulator of emotions' who will try to coax innocent women into having pre-marital sex and then within a matter of weeks will pressure them to marry 'in haste'. Once married, alleges a writer, he will brainwash the wife by twisting Islam and ordering her to obey the husband at all costs.

"Giorgio Armani has called Anna Wintour 'unprofessional' for skipping his fall 2014 show in favor of flying on to Paris Fashion Week. Mr Armani is so furious that he held a press conference to openly denounce the U.S. Vogue editor after his fashion show on Monday - Milan Fashion Week's final day. ‘She took an airplane, dumped [me] and went to Paris…’ said the designer, 79, whose brand is a major advertiser in Ms Wintour's magazine. 'It's not professional.’ Unhappy: Giorgio Armani (pictured taking a final bow at his fashion show on Monday) has spoken out against Anna Wintour's absence at his show . He added: ‘She is influential and powerful. But, perhaps, I’m influential as well.’ Mr . Armani says Ms Wintour assured him that other high-ranking . representatives from her publication attended the show in her place. But the designer was not impressed by this. ‘She . said she was sending her people. But if you go to see your dentist and . he puts you in the hands of his assistant, what’s your reaction?’ he . said. A spokesperson for . Vogue told WWD that ‘Anna has the greatest respect for Giorgio Armani . and everything he has done for Italy and fashion worldwide. ‘Unfortunately, . with the fashion calendar now running for more than a month, there are . some shows that Anna is not able to attend.’ Mr . Armani blames Ms Wintour’s absence on the fact that he is the only . influential designer to show on the final day of Milan Fashion Week – a . prestigious schedule slot that he has held for the past two decades. Around town: Ms Wintour had been spotted in the front row of other Milan Fashion Week shows before leaving for Paris, including Versace (left) and Aquilano Rimondi (right) He . told reporters backstage after his preview show that the Milan Fashion . Week calendar needs to be altered to maintain high-profile designers . until the end. Mr Armani explained that the Camera della Moda, which presides over the schedule, is at fault. ‘When we decided to show the last day, other big brands were involved. But currently this is an empty day,’ he said. In . the last few years Mr Armani has been an outspoken critic of the Camera . della Moda’s refusal to coordinate its fashion week dates with the . world’s other major fashion weeks. Currently, . there is an overlap, giving fashion editors and buyers a maximum of . twelve hours between the end of one city's fashion week and the . beginning of another. Ms . Wintour has been known to leave Milan Fashion Week early for this . reason. She also often leaves Paris Fashion Week early to return to New . York to publish Vogue. What she missed: Mr Armani's collection exhibited his signature for tailoring, fabricated in a primary wash of grey and green . However, . this season she may stay for Paris’s entire duration in order to catch . Nicolas Ghesquière’s debut show for Louis Vuitton, which is scheduled . for March 5 – the event’s final day. Mario . Boselli, the Camera della Moda president told WWD that his organization . spoke with Mr Armani after his press conference to resolve their . issues. ‘We met Mr Armani . earlier and he is totally fine now. In a certain way, it’s right that . the important journalists stay until the end of the week, and next . season, we will try to guarantee the presence of other big brands the . last day,’ he said.

"Rancid: Chicken feet are a delicacy in China; 20 tonnes of putrid out-of-date feet have been seized in southern China . A police raid of an illegal food store in southern China has exposed tonnes of rancid, decades-old chicken feet being 'processed' to be sold to unassuming customers. The decaying feet, some dating back to 1967, were being 'cleaned up', plumped up and whitened at the 'foul-smelling' plant using bleach and other chemicals, before being prepared for sale. Police, who raided the criminal operation in May, said they also found beef tripe, cartilage and other out-of-date animal organs - all of which had been smuggled across the border from neighbouring Vietnam. In total 20 tonnes of illegal meat was seized. According to local media, the gang, based in Nanning, the capital city of south China's Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, was able to make up to 16,000 yuan (£1,750) profit on every tonne of the putrid meat, by injecting it with chemicals, increasing its weight by 50 per cent. Li Jianmin, from the local Public Security Bureau, told Xinhua news agency, quoted by the South China Morning Post: 'The entire processing facility had a fishy and foul smell. You just couldn't stand it after one or two minutes.' The stomach-churning finding is not the first to be exposed in the area. Police in Guangxi, along China's border with Vietnam, have stepped up anti-smuggling operations over the last year and have raided seven illegal food processors. According to local police, quoted in The People's Daily, there were huge profits to be made from smuggling foods considered waste in other countries into China, where they are thought of as delicacies. Criminal gangs have been difficult to catch, however, because illegal meats are often hidden among other produce such as fruit and vegetables, and lorry drivers are often bribed to deny any knowledge of it. Among the seized meats over the last 12 months, police have found hundreds of bears' paws - another bizarre food sought after by Chinese chefs. Chicken feet and bear feet have both been sized in police raids on plants in southern China after a police crack down on smuggling illegal and out-of-date foods . Two raids in recent months have uncovered first 231 bear paws in an attempted smuggling case from Mongolia, and more recently 141  bear paws were seized. Two Russians were arrested in Inner Mongolia in connection with the first case, which valued the paws at 2.8 million yuan (£306,000). According to local media, smuggling remains a bone of contention for both China and its southern neighbour. The two countries failed to come to an agreement on cross-border trade last month during Vietnamese president Truong Tan Sang's state visit to China, where he met with his counterpart Xi Jiping. Media reports from both countries, which have been involved in rising tensions over territories in the South China Sea, lay the blame on the their respective governments for illegal foods entering their markets. Vietnamese press claim chicken, sturgeon, fruit and vegetables from China have been undercutting local market prices. While illegal out-of-date produce is creating a black market in China.","Rancid feet dating back to 1967 were being pumped with chemicals then sold .

"A make-up-only studio in Manhattan's SoHo is taking grooming-on-the-go to new heights. For $50, Pucker, which aims to be the blow dry bar of make-up, gives women the opportunity to have their face done professionally without the overbearing atmosphere of a department store. 'Right now the only options women have is . hiring a make-up artist to come to their house for $150 an hour, or a . department store where it's hit or miss,' co-founder Julio Sandino told MailOnline. 'Usually they're . better sales people than make-up artists, because they're . trying to push products on you.' For $50, New York-based Pucker takes women from bare-faced to glam in 30 minutes -- without the overbearing atmosphere of a department store (pictured: the reporter before and after visiting Pucker) Pucker has the appearance of a hair salon (there are eight spacious and hand-crafted make-up stations) with the atmosphere of your wealthy best friend's loft apartment. A cozy waiting area at the back of the store offers a space 'where women can come and . hang out with their friends, have cocktails and eat chocolate,' said Mr Sandino's partner in Pucker, co-founder Hiyam McKelvey. 'Or it can be for the gentleman who's . waiting for their significant other!' chimed in Mr Sandino, a celebrity make-up artist who has worked with Angelina Jolie, Tilda Swinton and on runway and advertising jobs for the likes of Marc Jacobs, Dolce & Gabbana and Versace. 'When Hiyam presented the idea to me I . thought it was an incredible idea.  Me being in the business for 21 . years, I knew exactly who to go to when I hired the Pucker make-up artists, people I have . worked with for years on fashion shoots and runway shows.' Pucker has the appearance of a hair salon (there are eight spacious and hand-crafted make-up stations) with the atmosphere of your wealthy best friend's loft apartment . Pucker uses its own line of paraben and allergen free make-up, which founders Juliano Sandino and Hiyam McKelvey made in collaboration with a cosmetics manufacturer in Long Island, New York . Mrs McKelvey, who is married to entrepreneur and WeWork founder Miguel McKelvey, was a stay-at-home mom who, 18 months ago, needed to . get her make-up done for an event. 'I hadn't really been that social and . I wanted to look as good as I could, but didn't really want to . deal with a department store and the awkwardness and the . pushiness associated with that,' she explained. 'I heard about Julio through a mutual . friend and I just knew he was the one to help me with this event. Not . only did we connect in a million different ways, but I had never . felt as beautiful and glamorous in my life. And I thought, I need to get . this out to everyone -- at an accessible price point.' It took eight months to take Pucker from concept to the store's opening on February 1st. In another eight months, Pucker will open its second store in the Financial District. 'We decided to really go for it in . October,' said Mrs McKelvey. 'We came to my husband with the idea . and he helped us get it off the ground really quickly.' Later this year Pucker will open its second store in the Financial District (pictured: Mr Sandino applying primer to a customer's face before he gets to work on her make-up) A cozy waiting area was built at the back of the store 'where women can come and hang out with their friends, have cocktails and eat chocolate,' said Mr Sandino's partner in Pucker, co-founder Hiyam McKelvey . The make-up itself takes between 45 minutes to an hour, but Pucker can have you in and out in 30 minutes for those in a rush, 'and that includes putting on natural lashes,' explained Mrs KcKelvey . Downstairs, Pucker has four dressing rooms, a shower with fresh towels and robes, storage lockers and an area to touch up hair, complete with straightening irons, curlers and hairspray; all of which are complimentary with a make-up appointment. 'Everyone knows how hard it is to get ready in . your office bathroom,' said Mrs McKelvey. 'We've all been the bag lady. So here you can store your bag; and for a small fee we can send a messenger to deliver it . the next day or you can just pick it up. 'Basically you can go . downstairs, put on your dress, store your stuff, get your make-up done . and go.' The make-up itself takes between 45 minutes to an hour, but Pucker can have you in and out in 30 minutes for those in a rush, 'and that includes putting on natural lashes,' explained Mrs KcKelvey. Pucker offers six standard make-up looks that can be customized to your own needs and preferences . Pucker uses its own line of paraben and allergen free make-up, which Mr Sandino and Mrs McKelvey made in collaboration with a cosmetics manufacturer in Long Island, New York; but unlike department stores, only the lipsticks and lip glosses are available for purchase. 'It's great if a . woman wants to take the color with them to touch up, which just feels . natural,' said Mr Sandino. For those who want to show off their new look on social media, Pucker set up a selfie station -- a private curtain-enclosed room with professional lights -- for the sole purpose of Instagram sharing. So get ready to pucker-up.

"GlaxoSmithKline said today it was investigating new allegations that its staff had used improper tactics to market Botox in China, but had so far found no evidence of bribery or corruption. The move follows a claim that GSK staff allegedly handed doctors cash and other rewards for prescribing Botox treatment, which the British group sells in China under an agreement with patent-holder Allergan. The latest allegations against GSK, which is already under investigation by Chinese police for unspecified 'economic crimes', were first reported by the Wall Street Journal. Did they bribe doctors? British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline is investigating new allegations that its staff had used improper tactics to market Botox in China . The newspaper said internal documents and email showed GSK's China sales staff were also apparently instructed to use their personal email addresses to discuss marketing strategies related to Botox. A GSK spokesman in London said the company believed the new allegations over Botox came from the same source who previously made claims over corruption in China - claims which GSK said earlier it had investigated and found to be without foundation. 'Nevertheless, we are investigating these new claims. However, our inquiries to date have found no evidence of bribery or corruption in relation to our sales and marketing of therapeutic Botox in China,' the spokesman said. 'GSK has some of the toughest compliance procedures in the sector. We are proud of our high standards and operate in accordance with them.' The Wall Street Journal said emails and documents it had seen also discussed a marketing strategy for Botox that targeted 48 doctors and planned to reward them with either a percentage of the cash value of the prescription, or educational credits, based on the number of prescriptions the doctors made. Claims: GSK staff allegedly handed doctors cash and other rewards for prescribing Botox treatment, which it sells under an agreement with patent-holder Allergan (file picture) The strategy was called 'Vasily' after the Russian World War II sniper Vasily Zaytsev. 'We have investigated the specific claim on the so-called Vasily programme. Our investigation has found that while the proposal didn't contain anything untoward, the programme was never implemented,' the company spokesman said. GSK is responsible for therapeutic sales of Botox in China - for example, to treat facial spasms - rather than its use as a cosmetic treatment to remove wrinkles. The allegations come as police in the south-central Chinese city of Changsha investigate high-level Chinese staff at GSK on suspicion of economic crimes. It is not clear if the Changsha investigation is related to any of the allegations. China is an increasingly important market for international pharmaceutical companies, which are relying on growth in emerging markets to offset slower sales in Western markets where many former blockbuster drugs have lost patent protection. IMS Health, which tracks pharmaceutical industry trends, expects China to overtake Japan as the world's second-biggest drugs market behind the United States by 2016.",Newspaper claims British firm used improper tactics to market procedure .
"An Ohio mother says her 13-year-old stabbed her multiple times to please Slender Man - the same fictional horror character that allegedly inspired a grisly knife attack in Wisconsin last week. The resident of Hamilton County, who has not been publicly named, told the station WLWT that her daughter was obsessed with the ghoulish Internet boogyman. According to the parent, the 13-year-old girl has been suffering from longstanding mental problems, but she never imagined the child would try to harm her. Chilling attack: This Ohio mother, pictured from behind, says her 13-year-old daughter stabbed her after becoming obsessed with Slender Man . Crime scene: The teenager confronted her mother in their kitchen (pictured) armed with a knife and wearing a white mask . Deeply disturbing: The woman said her daughter has been struggling with mental problems and had a fascination with demons and death . The teen had been fascinated with the macabre, writing about demons and insanity, and drawing vicious-looking creatures. Then one night, the mother came home from work, entered the kitchen and came face to face with her daughter wearing a white mask. The 13-year-old allegedly grabbed a kitchen knife and attacked her mother, leaving her with cuts on her neck and face, and a puncture wound to her back. The woman says that during the knife attack, her daughter mentioned playing a role and did not appear to be herself. Creepy: Slender Man is a prevalent internet myth that has been a viral sensation since it emerged online in 2009 . Last week, the Ohio mother heard of the brutal attack in Wisconsin, where Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier, both 12, allegedly stabbed their schoolmate 19 times and left her for dead in a bid to impress the mythological character Slender Man. According to court documents, the girls' plan was to murder the victim - what they referred to amongst themselves as 'stabby, stab, stab’ - and then join Slender Man in his mansion supposedly located somewhere in a national park. The kids reportedly learned about the demon-like figure on creepypasta.wikia.com, a website dedicated to horror stories and urban legends. The Ohio woman says that after following the news coverage from Wisconsin, she examined her daughter’s writings and discovered multiple references to Slender Man and killing. Shocking allegations: Morgan Geyser (left) and . Anissa Weier (right), both 12, have been charged with stabbing a schoolmate 19 times as a tribute to Slender Man . Miracle: Despite her many knife wounds, the 12-year-old victim (pictured on a gurney) was able to crawl for help and ended up surviving the attack . 'She even crated a world for Slender Man in the game MineCraft,' the woman revealed. Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier are facing up to 60 years in prison if convicted. Their 12-year-old victim miraculously survived the gruesome attack and was discharged from the hospital Friday.","Ohio mother says her daughter was wearing a white mask when she slashed her face and knifed her in the back .

Emily 8, Logan 9 and Brooke 3, were treated to a life-size pony cake by mother Maria Young . Maria spent £160 on ingredients and the colossal cake contained 16 roasting tins of sponge and 250,000 calories.

The first person who will live to see their 150th birthday has already been born, according to a leading scientist . The biomedical gerontologist and chief scientist of a foundation dedicated to longevity research claims that within his own lifetime doctors will have all the tools they need to 'cure' ageing. This will be done, he believes, by banishing all diseases and extending life indefinitely. Dr De Grey said: 'I'd say we have a 50/50 chance of bringing ageing under what I'd call a decisive level of medical control within the next 25 years or so. 'And what I mean by decisive is the same sort of medical control that we have over most infectious diseases today.' The British scientist sees a time when people will go to their doctors for regular 'maintenance', which by then will include gene therapies, stem cell therapies, immune stimulation and a range of other advanced medical techniques to keep them in good shape. He is chief scientific officer of the non-profit California-based SENS (Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence) Foundation, which he co-founded in 2009. Dr De Grey describes aging as the life-long accumulation of various types of molecular and cellular damage throughout the body. 'The . idea is to engage in what you might call preventative geriatrics, where . you go in to periodically repair that molecular and cellular damage . before it gets to the level of abundance that is pathogenic,' he said. Dr Aubrey De Grey describes aging as the life-long accumulation of various types of molecular and cellular damage throughout the body . Exactly how far and how fast life expectancy will increase in the future is a subject of some debate, but the trend is clear. An . average of three months is being added to life expectancy every year at . the moment and experts estimate there could be a million centenarians . across the world by 2030. To . date, the world's longest-living person on record lived to 122 and in . Japan alone there were more than 44,000 centenarians in 2010. Some . researchers say, however, that the trend towards a longer lifespan may . falter due to an epidemic of obesity now spilling over from rich nations . into the developing world. Dr . De Grey's ideas may seem far-fetched, but $20,000 offered in 2005 by . the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Technology Review journal for . any molecular biologist who showed that de Grey's SENS theory was 'so . wrong that it was unworthy of learned debate' was never won. The judges on that panel were prompted into action by an angry put-down of Dr De Grey from a group of nine leading scientists who dismissed his work as 'pseudo science'. They concluded that this label was not . fair, arguing instead that SENS 'exists in a middle ground of . yet-to-be-tested ideas that some people may find intriguing but which . others are free to doubt'. For . some, the prospect of living for hundreds of years is not particularly . attractive, either, as it conjures up an image of generations of sick, . weak old people and societies increasingly less able to cope. But Dr De Grey says that's not what he's working for. Keeping the killer diseases of old age at bay is the primary focus. He . said: 'This is absolutely not a matter of keeping people alive in a bad . state of health. This is about preventing people from getting sick as a . result of old age. 'The particular therapies that we are working on will only deliver long life as a side effect of delivering better health.' Dr De Grey divides the damage caused by ageing into seven main categories for which repair techniques need to be developed if his prediction for continual maintenance is to come true. He notes that while for some categories, the science is still in its earliest stages, there are others where it's already almost there. 'Stem cell therapy is a big part of this. It's designed to reverse one type of damage, namely the loss of cells when cells die and are not automatically replaced, and it's already in clinical trials (in humans),' he said. Stem cell therapies are currently being trialled in people with spinal cord injuries, and Dr De Grey and others say they may one day be used to find ways to repair disease-damaged brains and hearts. Cardiovascular diseases are the world's biggest age-related killers and Dr De Grey says there is a long way to go on these though researchers have figured out the path to follow. Heart diseases that cause heart . failure, heart attacks and strokes are brought about by the accumulation . of certain types of what de Grey calls 'molecular garbage' - byproducts . of the body's metabolic processes - which our bodies are not able to . break down or excrete. 'The garbage accumulates inside the cell, and eventually it gets in the way of the cell's workings, he said. Dr . De Grey is working with colleagues in the U.S. to identify enzymes in . other species that can break down the garbage and clean out the cells - . and the aim then is to devise genetic therapies to give this capability . to humans. 'If we could do that in the case of certain modified forms of cholesterol which accumulate in cells of the artery wall, then we simply would not get cardiovascular disease,' he said. Dr De Grey is reluctant to make firm predictions about how long people will be able to live in future, but he does say that with each major advance in longevity, scientists will buy more time to make yet more scientific progress. In his view, this means that the first person who will live to 1,000 is likely to be born less than 20 years after the first person to reach 150. 'I call it longevity escape velocity - where we have a sufficiently comprehensive panel of therapies to enable us to push back the ill health of old age faster than time is passing. 'And that way, we buy ourselves enough time to develop more therapies further as time goes on.' 'What we can actually predict in terms of how long people will live is absolutely nothing, because it will be determined by the risk of death from other causes like accidents,' he added. 'But there really shouldn't be any limit imposed by how long ago you were born. The whole point of maintenance is that it works indefinitely.'","Dr Aubrey De Grey also believes that the first person to live to 1,000 will be born in the next two decades ."
"A rocket scientist has urged Virgin Galactic to 'stay out of the space business' and 'go sell mobile phones'  in the wake of a fatal explosion aboard one of its spacecraft. Carolynne Campbell-Knight, a rocket propulsion scientist at the International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety (IAASS), said Richard Branson's private space line should 'give up' following the test flight crash in which a pilot was killed. Michael Alsbury, 39, died at the controls of Virgin's experimental SpaceShipTwo vessel on Friday after the sub-orbital plane exploded at 45,000ft shortly after engaging its engines. His co-pilot, Peter Siebold, who was seriously injured, is now 'alert and talking', according to the company. Scroll down for video . 'Go away': Carolynne Campbell-Knight (left) urged Virgin Galactic and its founder Richard Branson to 'stay out of the space business' Unknown: Mrs Campbell-Knight stressed it was not yet clear what caused the spacecraft to explode and crash into the desert . Answers: Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and Scale Composites inspect wreckage from the crash . Crashed: The wreckage of Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo lies in the Mojave Desert after a fatal crash. Experts have said they warned the company repeatedly over its safety procedures . Disaster: Moments after SpaceShipTwo detached from its mothership (left) and engaged its engines (center), it blew apart in the skies (right). The precise causes of the crash have yet to be established . Co-operation: Richard Branson said Virgin Galactic were complying with an independent investigation into the crash . Mrs Campbell-Knight said: 'They should stop, give up. Go away and do something they might be good at like selling mobile phones - they should stay out of the space business.' She claimed she had contacted those involved in the project in around 2009 or 2010 to raise her concerns about the use of nitrous oxide, which she said can 'go bang in a very unpredictable way'. But she stressed it was not yet clear what caused the latest incident, adding: 'There’s any number of things that could have brought it down.' Mrs Campbell-Knight, co-partner of Knights Arrow, an engineering project, is one of a number of space flight experts who have accused Virgin Galactic of ignoring warnings over its safety procedures in the wake of a fatal explosion aboard one of its spacecraft. Senior engineers and propulsion scientists say they spent years telling Richard Branson's private space line its procedures are 'outdated', needlessly secretive, and could lead to people getting killed. And, in a further sign of upheaval at Virgin Galactic, it was also revealed yesterday that top engineers in charge of safety, aerodynamics and the propulsion system have all recently quit the company. Many of the warnings stem from a 2007 disaster where an engine part exploded at a test facility in the Mojave Desert, killing three employees of Virgin Galactic's partner company, Scaled Composites. Some have accused Richard Branson's project of ignoring industry standards and refusing to share its procedures in its eagerness to perfect commercial space flight, which it has regularly estimated is just months from completion. One expert called the design and testing process a 'Russian roulette' which was bound to kill someone. Victim: Michael Alsbury, pictured, died in the crash yesterday . Carolynne Campbell, a rocket propulsion scientist at the International Association for the Advancement of Space Safety (IAASS), told the Sunday Telegraph she had been warning Virgin Galactic for seven years about its safety record. She said: 'This explosion is not a surprise. None whatsoever, I am sorry to say. It is exactly what I was expecting. It was Russian roulette which test flight blew up.' The executive director of the IAASS also said that Virgin Galactic refused to let scientists from outside the company review its procedures, and snubbed industry gatherings. Tomasso Sgobba, a former head of safety for the European Space Agency, said: 'They operated in secrecy, which is difficult to understand. 'They don’t use modern techniques in putting safety into the design... I have been saying for some years now this was an accident waiting to happen.' Geoff Daly, a concerned rocket scientist, also revealed that he wrote to the U.S. Chemical Safety Board urging them to do something about his safety concerns over SpaceShipTwo. Writing in July 2013, he said even the company's own engineers privately doubted that their venture was safe. At the time Virgin Galactic had said they were just five months away from taking their first passengers, including children, into space. He said: 'Sir Richard Branson, his two children, Justin Bieber and one other will be the first passengers to fly into space during this coming December 2013, and everyone realises there is a problem, even the engineers... have said so off the record.' The disaster came in the wake of three top engineers at Virgin Galactic quitting since late 2013. Jon Turnipseed, formerly the vice-president of safety, reportedly left just before Christmas. The Parabolic Arc blog reported that Virgin Galactic spent months unsuccessfully advertising for a successor to the job. The outlet also reported that Thomas Markusic, the vice-president of propulsion, left Virgin Galactic in January 2014 to work on a company sending unmanned satellites into space instead. Senior figures were walking out of the development facility as recently as last month, according to a biographer of Branson who said the 'crude' SpaceShipTwo's destruction was 'inevitable'. Speaking to the BBC's Today show yesterday, Tom Bower said: 'All the engineers in California working on the project I've spoken to said it was very dangerous, just a few weeks ago the last of many of the Virgin Galactic engineers walked out of the factory and said he'd never work there again.' He added: 'The most important issue was in 2007 - three engineers were killed in an explosion when a rocket exploded on the ground rocket explosion on the ground. 'Ever since then it has become apparent that the science used to create this rocket is completely unreliable.' The explosion seven years ago, which killed Scaled Composites employees Todd Ivens, Eric Blackwell and Charles May, has been the focus of many criticisms. Some say it ought to have been a wake-up call for the company. The fatal accident took place at a ground facility while testing an engine filled with nitrous oxide, a liquid fuel which is part of SpaceShipTwo's hybrid rocket engine. Explosion: One expert called the design and testing process a 'Russian roulette' which was bound to kill someone . 'Dangerous': Flight safety experts claim they repeatedly voiced their concerns over the private space line . Debris: A small part of the doomed spacecraft lies in the Californian desert. Experts have said they were not surprised by the crash . Wreckage: Officers keep watch over what remains of SpaceShipTwo, which crashed into the California desert on Friday . Findings: Investigators take photographs of the wreckage of SpaceShipTwo, which crashed into the Californian desert . Investigations failed to discover why the tank blew up - especially as the test was not meant to ignite the fuel. A study published by the IAASS said: 'We are not confident that … we yet know enough about N2O [nitrous oxide] to consider it a safe oxidiser for use in passenger flight. In the light of what we do know, safety must remain a major concern.' Daly, the rocket scientists, also referenced the fatal event, and wrote to the Federal Aviation Administration urging them to review Virgin Galactic's premit to operate space flights. He said: 'We respectfully request a response from you on what actions the FAA will be taking with respect to the permit issued and the operations as planned in the Mojave and New Mexico facilities. 'Remember three people have been killed and numerous persons injured by a prior explosion involving N2O in this motor design. We do not need another incident on the ground/flight line or in the air.' Fatal: Test pilot Michael Alsbury died on Friday morning after the spacecraft exploded at 45,000ft . Standing firm: Virgin Founder Richard Branson denied his company had ignored any warnings, and insisted that nothing can be known until the official investigation is finished . Speaking today at his Mojave Spaceport, Virgin founder Richard Branson denied that the company had ignored warnings. He said: 'To be honest I find it slightly irresponsible that people who know nothing about what they are saying can be saying things before the NTSB [one body investigating the crash] makes their comments. 'We aren’t going to push on blindly. To do so would be an insult to all those affected by this tragedy. We are going to learn from what went wrong, discover how we can improve safety and performance and then move forwards together. 'We owe it to our test pilots to find out exactly what went wrong and once we find out what went wrong, if we can overcome it, we’ll make absolutely certain that the dream lives on.'","Rocket scientists and space flight experts say they have worried for years over the safety of Virgin Galactic .

"An incredible phenomenon has been captured on video for the first time as washing-up bubbles are shown freezing in mid-air. The footage, filmed on cameras four-times sharper than HD, shows a group of children blowing the bubbles in a Canadian forest. As the bubbles hit the air, they crystallise and turn into hollow blocks of ice in slow motion. Scroll down for video . An incredible natural phenomenon has been captured on video for the first time as washing-up bubbles are shown freezing in mid-air. As the bubbles hit the air, they are shown crystallising and turning into hollow blocks of ice in slow motion (pictured) The video was directed by Leila and Damien de Blinkk, and was set in forests near Whistler in Canada. A series of 4K cameras were positioned to captured the bubbles as they hit the air. Shortly after each appears, the crystal-like structures of the ice are shown forming and bonding together. A bubble is formed when a layer of water molecules is trapped between two layers of soap molecules. Each soap molecule is positioned so one side faces the water, while the other faces away. Glycerin, C3H5(OH)3, extends the life of a bubble by forming hydrogen bonds with water, which slows down how quickly it evaporates. When a bubble is blown, the air inside it is warmed by the air in the blower’s lungs. As this warm air hits the cold air, it contracts to set the surface of a bubble. In extreme temperatures, this water layer freezes first, followed by the soap layer - making the walls of the bubble more structurally sound, and visible. The difference in air pressure and temperature eventually causes the air inside the bubble to disperse and burst the surrounding later. As these structures spread across the bubble, they are is shown creating a solid outer shell. The film then records the bubbles shattering and shards of ice falling to the ground. Director, Leila de Blinkk said: ‘We were blown away by the beauty of the intricate patterns that the freezing of the bubbles’ surface was creating at very low temperature. ‘The feather, flower and star ice shapes were so delicate and mesmerising when they reflected light. ‘To bring out all these details in 4K was to almost discover a new world, that we didn’t suspect existed.’ No special effects or editing were added to the bubbles, and the films were shot in real-time before being slowed down.

"Three men have been arrested by the Egyptian army for apparently trying to cut through an undersea Internet cable. A patrol stopped a fishing boat near the Mediterranean port city of . Alexandria and arrested three divers, an army spokesman said on his . official Facebook page. It is believed they were trying to cut through an SEA-ME-WE 4 undersea cable -  one of the main connections . between Asia and Europe, running from France to Malaysia and linking . Italy, north Africa, the middle east and south Asia. If the men had been successful, experts warned they could have taken an 'entire continent offline', but interruptions were reported around the region, including Dubai and India, today. A picture of the three men who are  believed to have been arrested in connection with the incident, which the Egyptian army has posted on Facebook . The cable targeted, the SEA-ME-WE 4, is 18,800 kilometres long, and is the primary internet 'backbone' between south-east Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East and Europe. It has 17 landing points, pictured above, which are the areas where the cable comes ashore . The men were reportedly just 750metres off the shore of Alexandria when they were caught. No indication of who the men were or what their motive for cutting the cable was. It is also unclear how much damage was done. But Sky News reported that there was evidence of slow internet connections as far away as Pakistan and India, according to a network security firm which studies web traffic. The cable is owned by Telecom Egypt, the biggest web provider in the north African country and slow services were expected to be improved by the end of today. Operator SEACOM said in the hours that followed the men's arrest that it was confident that full service would be restored quickly. It added in a statement earlier today: 'We understand from our Egyptian colleagues that the investigation is in its early stages and nothing is as yet confirmed with regard to the cause of the damage to SMW-4'. The company said that it did not believe that recent damage caused to another cable was caused by sabotage due to its location. Under the sea lies a multi-billion-dollar network of high-power cables through which 99 per cent of global internet traffic travels. Submarine cables are expensive to build (generally ranging from $100m - $500m) but they deliver a huge amount of capacity. Most of the new cables can deliver several terabits (terabit = 1,000 gigabit) of capacity. Each cable costs about $10m a year in maintenance costs -- the price operators have to pay to keep repair ships on standby, and other costs. The cables themselves are often not much wider than garden hoses and contain fibre-optic lines which can each contain bandwidth for up to 20 million people. One cable between the US and the UK carries 3.2 terabits of data per second - the 7,600 mile journey takes 0.00072 seconds. Data on newer, hi-tech internet cables is 'flashed' down the lines by high-powered lasers, and the intensity is maintained by electrical repeaters costing up to £1 million each. An electrical cable runs parallel to the fibre-optic line to power the repeaters. Failures can be catastrophic. One cable failure - between Sicily and Egypt - left more than 50 per cent of India without power in 2008, sending the country's computer industry and stock markets offline for hours. Jim Cowie, chief technology officer of US-based Renesys, said a cut cable can cause data to become congested and flow the long way around the world. The same SEA-ME-WE 4 was seriously damaged back in 2008 by a ship's anchor. Then, Egyptian web traffic was cut by around 75 per cent until the cable was repaired. News of the men's arrest comes after a bitter feud between two online companies - a group which aims . to block unwanted emails known as ‘spam’ and a firm accused of sending . them - has already been blamed for days of disruption for internet users, in the biggest cyber-attack ever launched. Spam-fighting organisation Spamhaus said it has been subjected to a massive cyber-attack, apparently from Dutch company Cyberbunker which it black-listed earlier . this month. At its peak, Cyberbunker clogged up 300 gigabits per second of the Internet, it has been reported. But if the men had been successful in their undersea sabotage attempt, it would have effectively switched off 1.28 terabits — four times as much bandwidth— and with nothing more high-tech than an axe, Quartz.com claims. It said: 'Most big countries have several redundant cables landing on their shores. 'But the loss of even a single one means that all the traffic must be jammed through remaining connections, causing congestion. 'And there is nothing to stop determined attackers from targeting several cables. Indeed, since many cables go through geographic chokepoints like the Suez, it wouldn’t be difficult to disrupt a whole bunch of connections in a brief period of time.' In the past week there have been several reports of severed cables off the coast of Egypt that are part of Seacom, a network of cables serving much of Africa. Business Standard, of India, reports many using Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India, Tata Communications and state-run Bharat Sanhar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) had witnessed disruption or a slower speed during the past few days as a result of the recent fibre optic cable breaks off the Egyption coast, close to Alexandria. It reports the fibre optics which were cut include Europe India Gateway (EIG), Telecom Egypt North (TEN), South East Asia–Middle East–Western Europe 4 (SMEWE4), India-Middle East-Western Europe (IMEWE). It had been thought that ships had accidentally caught the cables, but there are now concerns there could be a concerted effort to take down . Egypt’s connectivity, although it has not been confirmed whether the . incidents are connected.

Just like a well-scripted scene synonymous with the WWE, current Intercontinental Champion Wade then drafted in the help of another English footballer in the form of PNE's Kevin Davies, prompting WWE CEO Vince McMahon into arranging a tag-team bout.

"Vince Cable (pictured) claimed a left-leaning pact between Labour, the LibDems and the SNP  would be 'possible' if there is another hung parliament . Vince Cable yesterday opened the door to a 'rainbow coalition' of Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP following the General Election. The Business Secretary went further than any other senior Westminster politician as he claimed a left-leaning pact between the three parties would be 'possible' if there is another hung parliament. Labour leader Ed Miliband has played down the prospect of a deal with the resurgent SNP, but Mr Cable insisted there is 'no taboo' on the Nationalists. However, he said whichever party has the most seats at Westminster should have the first opportunity to form a government. He went on to condemn recent remarks from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who said she would prop Labour up in Downing Street even if the Tories win the election. Mr Cable was one of the key figures when the current Tory/Lib Dem coalition was formed in 2010, but has remained a critic of the Conservatives and is frequently tipped as his party's next leader. In recent years, Labour has courted Mr Cable in the hope of forming a coalition with the Lib Dems after May's election, and Mr Miliband revealed in 2012 that he was in regular text message contact with the Cabinet minister. But polls suggest the Lib Dems face an election drubbing, particularly in Scotland, and the SNP could emerge as the third largest force in UK politics. Miss Sturgeon – who insists she will lead post-election negotiations rather than Alex Salmond – has ruled out any deal with the Tories, yet is willing to prop up Mr Miliband in Number Ten. In return, she wants the replacement programme for Trident nuclear missiles to be scrapped, an end to 'austerity' and sweeping new powers for Holyrood that critics fear would lead to 'independence by the back door'. Senior Scottish Labour MPs are known to bitterly oppose the idea, but Mr Miliband has repeatedly declined to entirely rule out a post-election deal. Any pact would most likely would be a 'supply and demand' arrangement, ensuring budgets and other key pieces of legislation were passed rather than a formal coalition. Speaking to journalists on a visit to Edinburgh yesterday, Mr Cable said: 'There is probably going to be an issue in the next parliament of minority government. We don't absolutely know, it could go all kind of different directions. 'When that happens there are all kind of different possibilities – coalition, support outside coalition - and I think any sensible party has to be willing to look at all those possibilities in an open-minded way. 'What the country will need is stability, I don't think the electorate will be at all well-disposed to any party – whether it's one of the UK parties or the SNP – which aims to destabilise the government and runs back to the electorate after a few months.' Asked about Miss Sturgeon's claim that she would do a deal with Labour even if it was the second largest party at Westminster, Mr Cable said: 'We adopt a different approach – we think you have to show respect for the electorate. 'You have to respect the principle that the party with the largest number of seats at Westminster has a basic legitimacy. That's where we started from in 2010.' Scroll down for video . Mr Cable (pictured) was one of the key figures when the current Tory/Lib Dem coalition was formed in 2010, but has remained a critic of the Conservatives and is frequently tipped as his party's next leader . Quizzed on the possibility of the Lib Dems working with the SNP, he continued: 'We're perfectly happy to work with the SNP. There's no taboo on the SNP. 'The party we had the greatest degree of difference from were the Tories, but given the reality of the situation in 2010 – the need for a stable government, the extreme nature of the economic crisis – we worked together in a business-like way and we would approach the SNP in precisely the same way.' Asked if a 'rainbow coalition' with Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems is therefore a possibility, Mr Cable replied: 'It's possible. We're not leaning in one direction or the other, we're trying to be equidistant between the parties and leave the public to decide which direction they go, but certainly that kind of arrangement would be possible – I certainly wouldn't rule it out.' Mr Cable insisted the Lib Dems will not get wiped out north of the Border, despite polls suggesting that Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander and Women's Minister Jo Swinson could be out of a job. 'I think we'll get far more MPs back than the polls are indicating at the moment,' he said. 'These average figures, which I know are quite low in Scotland, don't actually tell you the underlying trend about what's happening in Argyll or Aberdeenshire or Edinburgh West. I think the vast majority of our colleagues will get back. '[For Danny Alexander] it's an uphill struggle. But he's got a very high profile, he's delivered a lot for his area as well as across the UK, so I would include him in the category of people who when it comes to the crunch, people will look at the individual and their record as an MP and I'm pretty confident we shall see them back.' Labour leader Ed Miliband (left) has played down the prospect of a deal with the resurgent SNP. Mr Cable hinted at a 'rainbow coalition' of Labour, the Lib Dems and David Cameron's (right) Conservative party . The Business Secretary went on to criticise Miss Sturgeon's recent bid to delay plans to cut Britain's deficit and spend an extra £180billion over four years, in return for SNP support in the Commons. 'I'm not sure that delay is a good doctrine in itself,' he said. 'You've got to face the realities. 'I think if [the SNP] did find themselves in government, they would find themselves making some very difficult decisions. Any responsible government has to deal with very large deficits.' Last night, SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson said: 'A strong team of SNP MPs will be a progressive force for change across the UK, standing up for Scotland's interests and an alternative to austerity focused on jobs, growth and fairness. 'Unlike the Lib Dems, we have made clear that we will never help the Tories into government - and having played their part in inflicting devastating cuts over the last five years, the Lib Dems must now answer to the electorate in May.' A spokesman for the Scottish Labour Party said: 'In every election since the 1930s the biggest party has formed the government. This election is about evicting David Cameron from Downing St and only the Labour Party can do that. 'A vote for any other party makes it get more likely that the Tories will be the biggest party, and David Cameron will get into government through the back door.'","Vince Cable suggested 'rainbow coalition' of Labour, Lib Dems and SNP .

"Roy Keane has been questioned by police after he allegedly got into a row with a taxi driver . Roy Keane has been questioned under caution over an alleged road rage rant with a taxi driver at a set of traffic lights. The former Manchester United star was said to have launched into a foul-mouthed tirade and made obscene gestures after jumping out his Range Rover in Altrincham, Greater Manchester. Fateh Kerar, 44, claims the row last month was sparked when he and his female passenger spotted the TV pundit at a cash machine in nearby Hale. He says he said 'hello' to the 43-year-old and asked him to 'smile' before Keane got into his car and began following his taxi. It is then alleged that when the cars stopped at traffic lights an 'angry' Keane, who lives in Bowdon, Cheshire, got out and started acting 'very aggressive'. Police launched an investigation into the incident at 11.30am on January 30 and Keane was interviewed under caution by officers at a police station earlier this month. A Greater Manchester Police spokesperson said: 'Mr Keane was interviewed under caution at a police station on February 3. 'We are currently in contact with the CPS about this matter.' They added that the Crown Prosecution Service will make a decision about whether the assistant manager of Republic of Ireland will face any charges. However, a CPS spokesperson said they had not received any information from police so they were unable to comment further. Mr Kerar, 44, claims he was left 'shaking and terrified' by Keane's behaviour. 'He got out of his car in the middle of the road, held two fingers up and walked out in front of me He was pointing and swearing and being very aggressive,' he said. 'He shouldn't be allowed to treat people that way. There were lots of people stood around who couldn't believe what they were seeing.' Keane refused to comment when questioned by reporters last month.

"Its moments of high drama usually involve burnt cakes or ‘soggy bottoms’. So viewers of The Great British Bake Off were understandably shocked when the BBC2 show turned into a ‘bloodbath’ worthy of Casualty. One of the star contestants, 23-year-old John Whaite from Manchester, was forced to withdraw from the strudel round after slicing his finger on an electric mixer. Scroll down for video . Shocked: John Whaite cut himself while trying to bake a strudel on The Great British Bakeoff on BBC2 . But instead of passing tactfully over the incident, producers treated the show’s dedicated fans to close-up shots of his blood-soaked hand. Some took to Twitter to complain. One said: ‘I greatly dislike the sight of blood. Great British Bake Off was rank. Blood glove. Eew.’ Another said: ‘Did not expect to see blood on The Great British Bake Off. Not hungry any more,’ while a third simply called it a ‘bloodbath’. In a tense climax, Mr Whaite – who has a strong female following – was spared elimination, with the judges deciding to vote off two contestants next week instead. The accident happened halfway through Tuesday night’s episode, as contestants competed in the ‘showstopper challenge’, set by judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood. Emergency aid: Contestant Mr Whaite, 23, from Manchester, is led away for treatment on his hand . As he made his strudel, Mr Whaite was seen wearing a blue glove on his right hand. He explained: ‘I’m having to start again because I stupidly – it’s my own fault – I put my finger in the Magimix and just slid it across the blade. It’s just knocked me off balance a little but I’ll be all right.’ Soon, however, the law student was forced to sit down as blood filled the glove and began pouring down his arm. Looking increasingly pale, he said: ‘I need to wash it. I keep on feeling dizzy.’ As the cameras showed a close-up of his cut, host Sue Perkins provided a rather vivid  running commentary. Help is at hand: Danny Bryden, a doctor, and host Sue Perkins (right) take charge of the situation . Miss Perkins said: ‘John’s been soldiering on with a cut finger, but it’s deeper than first feared, and stretching the pastry has stretched the wound.’ She added: ‘Luckily there is a doctor in the marquee. Danny [Bryden, another contestant] is an intensive care consultant.’ Despite begging to be allowed to continue, Mr Whaite was led off for treatment. He later returned with his arm in a sling, saying: ‘I’m just so gutted because I really think my strudel’s going to be amazing.’ Watch the full episode on BBC iPlayer .","John Whaite, 23, from Manchester, was forced to withdraw from the round .

"Skins star Kaya Scodelario broke up with her Shameless actor boyfriend after he threw a trainee plumber from his bonnet during a late-night row, a court heard. The claim was made today in the High Court, where actor Elliott Tittensor is being sued for £300,000  by 'victim' Oliver Flint - who was left brain-damaged and blind in one eye by the 2010 incident. Mr Flint and the actor, who played Carl Gallagher in Channel 4's Shameless, clashed outside a McDonald's in Kentish Town, North London. The actor accused Mr Flint of 'groping' his girlfriend Ms Scodelario then jumping on his bonnet, which prompted him to flee the scene while she was still in the fast food restaurant. Case: Shameless star Elliott Tittensor (right) threw a plumber from his bonnet - leaving him with brain damage - in a row which prompted Mr Tittensor to break up with his actress girlfriend (left), the High Court heard . Kaya Scodelario has since said the distressing incident prompted her break-up with the Shameless star three years later, according to the trainee plumber's lawyer. Barrister Andrew Roy made the claim as he questioned the actor's version of events, citing that 'to the best of Ms Scodelario's knowledge' the attack had 'caused her relationship with Mr Tittensor to end'. Now 25, Mr Tittensor was fined £750 and handed six penalty points following the incident after he admitted driving without insurance. Mr Flint was 18 at the time of the row in August 2010 and said he suffered head injuries, the loss of sight in his left eye and brain damage which caused a dramatic personality change. Anger: Oliver Flint (pictured) is suing Mr Tittensor for £300,000 over the row which left him blind in one eye . Now 22, he is claiming damages for 'unlawful battery' against the actor, who with his twin brother Luke has starred in Shameless and Brookside. Barrister Andrew Roy, for Mr Flint, told the High Court the incident began when the plumber asked to use Mr Tittensor's phone because his battery had run out. When he asked for a second time the actor swore at him, Mr Roy said. Mr Flint then 'responded by swearing back and slamming his hand on the car bonnet', before Mr Tittensor 'drove forward' and 'hit Mr Flint with the front of his car'. With Mr Flint on his bonnet, the barrister said Mr Tittensor 'continued to drive forward whilst shaking the wheel to throw Mr Flint off the bonnet, and succeeding in throwing him violently and heavily to the ground.' But the Shameless star fiercely denied the plumber's version of events, saying he acted in self-defence. He reported what he called a 'frenzied attack' to police an hour later and told them: 'A guy jumped on my bonnet and groped my girlfriend'. Speaking from the witness box today, he said: 'Kaya's safety was a concern of mine, but my own was my main concern at the time, because of what I'd been through. Mr Flint was very aggressive.' 'It was a ridiculously lurid incident... I was too frightened... I was so scared after the whole of what happened I didn't know what to do.' William Norris QC, for Mr Tittensor, said the plumber was 'wholly the author of his own misfortune'. The barrister said: 'He was drunk and... accosted Mr Tittensor's then girlfriend, Kaya Scodelario. 'He stood in front of his car and tried to prevent him driving off, banging on the bonnet, then climbing onto it and attacking the windscreen. 'In fear for his own safety, Mr Tittensor drove away just to escape, and succeeded is dislodging Mr Flint, who fell from the bonnet and sustained serious injury. 'In acting as he did, Mr Tittensor was behaving reasonably in reacting to an unexpected and frightening event. 'He did not intend to collide with him, and did not in fact do so. Rather, it was Mr Flint who got onto the bonnet deliberately and Mr Tittensor only tried to dislodge him. Couple: Shameless star Elliott Tittensor and his then-girlfriend, Skins star Kaya Scodelario. They split in 2013 . Scene: The incident happened nearly five years ago outside this McDonald's in Kentish Town, north London . 'Mr Tittensor's case, simply, is that he acted reasonably in trying to drive away and in dislodging an aggressor who had threatened him, attacked his car, and got onto the bonnet to continue that attack.' Of his client driving off, Mr Norris added: 'Such conduct should really be seen as more consistent with someone who fled the scene in a panic, frightened to the extent that he was no longer behaving in a rational and dispassionate way. 'Only that explains why he made his escape even before Kaya Scodelario had come out of the restaurant.' Mr Norris accused the plumber of having 'some history of aggressive behaviour', including a conviction for being drunk and disorderly. Mr Flint admitted that he had been disorderly on that previous occasion, but it was only to the extent of 'not doing what I was told by a police officer.' Cult hit: Elliott Tittensor (far right) was one of the longest-running faces in the bleak Channel 4 drama . Gritty: Mr Tittensor in a scene from Shameless (above), in which he starred for several years with his twin . But the plumber's barrister hit back, calling the actor's version of events 'highly improbable'. 'To hit and run in this way is not reasonable behaviour,' he said. 'To the contrary it is unlawful'. He said Kaya Scodelario has been friendly to the plumber since - something that would be unlikely if her ex-boyfriend had been an innocent victim of a 'frenzied attack' that broke up their relationship. The barrister said: 'This is surprising, to put it mildly, if, to the best of Ms Scodelario's knowledge, Mr Flint had carried out the frenzied attack attributed to him and had moreover caused her relationship with Mr Tittensor to end, itself improbable if Mr Tittensor was a blameless victim, as he contends.' The High Court hearing continues.","Claim came as Elliott Tittensor sued for £300k by 'victim' in High Court .

"A black Connecticut police officer who was recently acquitted in a brutality case has been targeted in a threatening, racist memo apparently sent by a fellow cop. The note, written on official letterhead and starting with the words 'WHITE POWER', was found in internal mailboxes in Bridgeport's police department day room, which is only accessible by officers. 'Officer Clive Higgins doesn't belong here in this Police Department,' reads the note, which was shared by NBC Connecticut. 'These Black Officers belong in the toilet.' Higgins, 49, was acquitted last month in a 2011 police brutality case. Footage had emerged showing him and two other officers kicking a suspected drug dealer after the man had been tasered. Scroll down for videos . Terrifying: Police officers in Bridgeport, Connecticut received this memo, written on official letterhead, in their internal mailboxes. The note targets a black officer acquitted last month in a police brutality case . Acquitted: Officer Clive Higgins, pictured outside court with his wife last August, was the target of the racist memo. He was acquitted last year of police brutality . The other two officers, Elson Morales and Joseph Lawlor, both pleaded guilty while Higgins, who was seen arriving after the other two officers had already subdued the suspect, pleaded not guilty. Morales and Lawlor both agreed to resign from the police department after pleading guilty, while Higgins remains at the force. 'He doesn't belong here,' the memo continues. 'He didn't even support his fellow Officers in Court. Where were you Higgins ?? You better watch your back.. We know where you live. 'Remember you have no duty weapon to defend yourself.' The startling letter also claims that the chief and assistant chief want Higgins out of the department. Bridgeport police Detective Harold Dimbo told NBC Connecticut that he believes a member of the department wrote the memo because of where it was found. In a statement on Tuesday, Dimbo, who is also vice president of the Bridgeport Guardians, a minority officers' organization, said the letter is 'creating a hostile work environment'. Violent: In the case, two other officers, Elson Morales and Joseph Lawlor (both pictured), pleaded guilty to violating a suspect's civil rights after tasering him into submission and then kicking him on the ground . Backup: Another officer, Clive Higgins, who was targeted in the racist memo, then arrives on the scene . Threats: In the video, Higgins was seen kicking the man on the ground but he was acquitted in the case. The disgusting racist note threatens him for failing to show up in court for the other officers . 'This type of behavior affects the minorities and spreads racism and hatred throughout the Bridgeport Police Department as well as the community,' the statement said. 'As the Vice-President of the Bridgeport Guardians, I would like to work with the administration and the community to resolve and eliminate this behavior and fire those that stand behind it.' The city's communications director, Brett Broesder, said officials are prepared to take action against the person responsible for the note. 'Bottom line is that any discussion of discrimination within any part of the city is something we have a zero-tolerance policy on,' he said. In the police brutality case, the city agreed to pay $198,000 to the victim, Orlando Lopez-Soto,  the Connecticut Post reported. He is now serving five years in prison after pleading guilty to drug and gun charges in 2012. He had claimed that his civil rights had been violated because he was unable to defend himself after being tasered and the video, which emerged two years later, helped prove his case, his lawyer said. Guilty: Officer Elson Morales, pictured center with his wife and attorney last June, pleaded guilty in the case . Accused: Another officer, Joseph Lawlor, pictured with his girlfriend outside the court last June, also pleaded guilty. Both officers agreed to leave the police force and now face up to a year in prison . During Higgins' trial, an FBI agent had testified that the police officer had been concerned that the suspect was armed so kicked him to stop him getting up. Higgins said the police had previously received information that the man was 'terrorizing' people in the park with a gun, the Connecticut Post reported. 'I'm a Christian man,' he said after his acquittal. 'I should never have had to go through this nonsense. I was hired to protect the citizens of Bridgeport and that's all I ever tried to do.' Higgins, an officer in Bridgeport since 2002 and a Sunday school teacher, had faced up to 10 years behind bars if he had been convicted. The other two officers face up to a year in prison.

"Darren Clarke will lead Europe's bid for a fourth successive Ryder Cup victory after being named captain for the 2016 contest with the United States at Hazeltine. The 46-year-old Northern Irishman, who played in five Ryder Cups and was a vice-captain in 2010 and 2012, was chosen ahead of Miguel Angel Jimenez and Thomas Bjorn by a five-man selection panel at Wentworth. Clarke said: 'I am naturally extremely proud to be selected as European Ryder Cup captain for 2016.

'I am lucky to have played and worked under some fantastic captains in my seven Ryder Cups to date and I look forward to the challenge of trying to follow in their footsteps and help Europe to a fourth consecutive victory at Hazeltine next year.' The selection panel consisted of the three most recent captains - Paul McGinley, Jose Maria Olazabal and Colin Montgomerie - along with European Tour chief executive George O'Grady and players' representative David Howell. McGinley and Clarke's relationship has been severely strained since Clarke put himself forward for the 2014 captaincy, having previously sent McGinley a letter supporting the Dubliner's candidacy. And when Tom Watson was named US captain in December 2012, Clarke suggested 2010 captain Montgomerie should also be considered as 'whoever it is standing on that stage opposite Tom Watson needs a huge presence'.

With the support of star players such as Rory McIlroy and Ian Poulter it was McGinley who eventually won the day, and he insisted after leading Europe to victory at Gleneagles last year that he would not let personal feelings affect his view on his successor. Clarke has also stated he would be 'foolish' not to immediately seek McGinley's advice if given the daunting job of following in his footsteps. The last of Clarke's five appearances as a player was an emotionally-charged occasion at the K Club in 2006, when he somehow won all three of his matches just weeks after the death of his first wife Heather from cancer. Clarke and long-time friend Lee Westwood played the final fourball match of the first session against Phil Mickelson and Chris Di Marco, with Clarke hitting his opening drive more than 300 yards down the fairway and then holing from 12 feet for birdie.

"With elegant black and tan keys, it looks just like a baby grand piano. But when the instrument's keys are stuck, they release the distinctive sound of a cello. The remarkable creation is the viola organista - which was originally designed by Leonardo da Vinci in the late 15th century, but never built. Now, hundreds of years later, it has come to life thanks to a Polish concert pianist with a flair for making instruments. Scroll down for video . Instrument: Polish musician Slawomir Zubrzycki has created a Viola Organista - which looks like a piano but sounds like a cello - based on a late 15th-century design by Leonardo da Vinci . Dedication: Mr Zubrzycki, spent almost £6,000 on his creation, and dedicated 5,000 hours to building it . Musician Slawomir Zubrzycki spent at least 5,000 hours on his creation - and spent around £6,000. 'This instrument has the characteristics of three we know: the harpsichord, the organ and the viola da gamba,' Zubrzycki said . 'Leonardo da Vinci invented it around 1470-80. I have no idea what Leonardo da Vinci . might think of the instrument I've made, but I'd hope he'd be pleased,' he added. Inside the instrument are sixty-one steel strings - . similar to the inside of a baby grand. Each one is connected to the keyboard . complete with smaller black keys for sharp and flat notes. But unlike a . piano, it has no hammered strings. Instead, there are four spinning wheels . wrapped in horse tail hair, like violin bows. To turn them, Mr Zubrzycki . pumps a peddle below the keyboard connected to a crankshaft. As the musician hits the keys, they press the strings down onto the wheels emitting the sound of a cello, an organ and even an accordion. Interior: The instrument has sixty-one steel strings like a baby grand piano, pictured. Each are pressed down onto four spinning wheels when the player hits a key . First: There is no historical evidence to suggest that any one has previously built a viola organista. Similar instruments do exist such as the Geigenwerk, or fiddle work . Design: A sketch of the viola organista can be found in Da Vinci's, left, Codex Atlanticus, right . As there . are no historical records suggesting Da Vinci or anyone else built the . exact instrument he designed, this is thought to be the first instrument of its . kind. A sketch complete with notes of the viola organista can be found in da Vinci's . Codex Atlanticus - a 12-volume collection of his manuscripts and . designs covering everything from mathematics to botany, weaponry to . flight. Other similar instruments have been created, however.

The museum also contains another built in 1625 by Spaniard Truchado Raymundo. 'It's the only wholly preserved example of this instrument"" from the past, MIM expert Pascalle Vandervellen said. Japan's Aiko Obuchi built a compact table-top model a decade ago, but information about any others is hard to come by. Contemporary examples are 'very rare,' Vandervellen said. The instrument was debuted Academy of Music in Poland's historic southern city of Krakow. On attendee, Gabor Farkas, an award-winning Hungarian concert pianist and a teacher at the Ferenc Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest, fell in love with what he heard. 'It's a keyboard instrument but it sounds like someone is playing it with a bow like a violin or a cello - a very warm sound, very velvety, very beautiful . 'One thing the piano is missing is that as soon as you hit one note, it dies. Here you can make a crescendo. It's the dream of all pianists!' Polish concert pianist Marian Sobula agreed. 'I've fallen in love with this sound. All pianists and string players yearn for it, for these long, never-ending notes which you can't play on the piano. It just gives you goose bumps.'","Viola organista originally designed by Leonardo da Vinci in the late 15th century - but there is no historical evidence to suggest it was ever built .

"A size 24 woman who was left mortified after being unable to fit into an aeroplane seat has lost more than half her bodyweight. Liz Hiscutt, 40, who would gorge on chocolate, crisps and takeaways every night, had been overweight her whole life and hit 18st after surviving on a diet of unhealthy food. Miss Hiscutt, of Gravesend, Kent, said her turning point came on a holiday to Portugal when cabin crew were forced to get a seatbelt extension to stretch over her stomach. Liz Hiscutt, 40, dropped from 18 stone (left) to nine stone (right) after she became too large to fit an aeroplane seatbelt around her size 24 frame . Her holiday horror prompted Miss Hiscutt to lose  9st 3lbs and she shrunk from a size 24 to size 8. She said: 'I couldn't wait for a bit of sunshine as we jetted off to Portugal but my excitement turned to shame as I struggled to pull the plane seatbelt over my bulging belly. 'I was mortified as the cabin crew fitted a seatbelt extender and was embarrassed for the rest of the three-hour flight.' Liz, an administrator, has struggled with her weight since she was in school. She said: 'I wasn't obese as a child, but I was not the slimmest. As I got older and moved away from home I started eating more and more.' Her holiday horror prompted Miss Hiscutt to lose 9st 3lbs and she shrunk from a size 24, left, to size 8, right . She would tuck into mounds of crisps and chocolate every day before spending the evening on the sofa next to fiance Richard William, 48, for a takeaway every evening. Before she knew it, Miss Hiscutt tipped the scales at  18st 3lbs and she was forced to hide her frame under size 24 clothes. She said: 'I used to eat a lot of food - I didn't believe in small portions. I feel like I have never had an ""off switch"" with food - I will eat whatever's put in front of me. It doesn't matter how heavy or fattening it is. 'I hardly ever exercised - I even struggled to get up the stairs. It's a miracle I never developed any life-threatening conditions as a result of my obesity.' The final humiliation came on a flight to Portugal in 2011 when the cabin crew had to find a seatbelt extender after Miss Hiscutt struggled to stretch the standard belt around her waist. Now Miss Hiscutt weighs 9st 1lb and can fit into size eight clothes. Since her dramatic weight loss, health conscious Miss Hiscutt has completed several 10K runs and plans on completing a half-marathon before the end of the year . She said: 'It was quite upsetting, but the cabin crew were very professional and gave me a bigger seatbelt without anyone laughing. I knew I was overweight so I had resigned myself to being fat for the rest of my life. 'Moments like that make you think about changing.' Before losing weight, she would tuck into mounds of crisps and chocolate every day before spending the evening on the sofa . On the same holiday, Miss Hiscutt faced further embarrassment when a cafe owner replaced a plastic chair with a reinforced metal one in case the flimsier chair collapsed under her weight. She said: 'For the whole holiday I stayed in my frumpy clothes, I didn't dare to bare my flesh on the beach in a swimming costume or a bikini.' Her holiday  convinced her to finally shed the pounds and in May 2012 she signed up to her local Slimming World group. The determined slimmer ditched curries and cakes for fresh vegetables and sweet potatoes, following a carefully constructed diet plan. Before her weight loss, Miss Hiscutt would tuck into a McDonald's egg McMuffin for breakfast with two hash browns and a coffee. She would skip lunch but snack on crisps and chocolate throughout the day. In the evening she would eat a takeaway tandoori mixed grill and bombay potatoes with rice, poppadoms and naan bread. Now, she eats fresh fruit and yoghurt for breakfast, a salad and jacket potato for lunch and a veggie burger in a wholemeal bap with a salad for dinner. Throughout the day she snacks on fruit. A month after starting her weight loss journey she had lost a stone through diet and attending Zumba and yoga classes. She said: 'I couldn't believe it. I knew I could keep going and lose more. I managed to lose six stone without putting on any weight at all, it just kept dropping off. I still ate tons of food, but the food I was eating was much healthier.' Now Miss Hiscutt weighs 9st 1lb and can fit into size eight clothes. Since her dramatic weight loss, health conscious Miss Hiscutt has completed several 10K runs and plans on completing a half-marathon before the end of the year. She said: 'I still can't get my head around the fact I can fit into size eight clothes - I have to take a skinny person with me so they will stop me buying massive dresses. I still think of myself as a fat person. 'I can shop anywhere, I can pick up a T-shirt which looks like it's the size of a hanky to me and it will fit. When I look in the mirror I still can't believe it's me.'

"John Terry has hailed the goal knack of defender Branislav Ivanovic and claims it is down to 'desire' and 'strength' not good fortune. Ivanovic scored Chelsea's goal in a 1-1 draw in the Champions League away to PSG to enhance his reputation for scoring crucial goals at key moments in big matches. 'He has scored some important goals for us,' said captain Terry. 'Look at the Liverpool one a couple of weeks ago. He pops up in the final of the Europa League. He really is a top player for the team. It's a desire and hunger he's got and the aggression and strength he's got to want to firstly get in those positions and secondly out-strength the opponent and be a lot hungrier.'

Ivanovic wheels away in celebration after scoring a precious away goal for Jose Mourinho's side . John Terry claims it is no fluke that Ivanovic pops up to score important goals in big games for Cheslea . Ivanovic scored an extra-time winner against Liverpool in the Capital One Cup semi-final last month and his header to beat Benfica and win the Europa League final in 2013 has it's place in Chelsea history. In Paris, the goal was the work of three quarters of Chelsea's back-four with Gary Cahill flicking Terry's low cross into the air for Ivanovic to finish. 'Yeah, it was all about the low cross,' joked Terry. 'I said to Gaz I'd seen him. No, I just managed to whip it in. I don't know why or what I was doing there but it was a great flick from Gaz and more importantly a great header from Iva.' PSG goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu was unable to stop Ivanovic's header from hitting the back of the net . Serbia international Ivanovic wheels away in celebration after scoring his fifth goal of the season . Edinson Cavani equalised but Chelsea hung on, with a little luck and some fabulous saves by goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who was recalled in favour if Petr Cech. 'It's unlucky for Big Pete,' said Terry. 'He made two unbelievable saves from Lukaku against Everton last week, but he has been unbelievably professional around the club this season. I've seen a lot of players in my time throw their toys out of the pram. 'He's been different class for the team, and that's been important. The manager stresses the importance of the team coming first. They're both there for the whole squad. Both of them have been excellent. PSG forward Edinson Cavani (right) celebrates after cancelling out Ivanovic's first-half opener . Cavani looks to the sky after scoring past Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois in the 54th minute . 'We've got the two best goalkeepers in the world in my opinion both fighting for one place. It's difficult. You can't keep them both happy. The manager manages to do it, I don't know how. Obviously they both want to play all the time. But the two of them are at the top of their games. Rotating them is a tough job. I'd rather that was the manager's decision.' Jose Mourinho faces the tricky decision of which goalkeeper to select in the Capital One Cup final against Tottenham at Wembley on Sunday week. 'Pete's played most of the games (in the Capital One Cup) and Thibaut played the last round. But the manager's always stressed the team comes first. That's the most important thing.' Thibaut Courtois was recalled to the Chelsea line-up for PSG clash and made a number of important stops . Cech had to make do with a place on the bench for the first leg of the last-16 Champions League clash . Cech's contract expires next year and there will be a clamour for his signature at the end of the season. Terry said: 'We've not even spoken and credit to Pete, he's not rumbled the dressing room or sent shockwaves through the dressing room. He's been really professional. 'He knows he's been a top keeper and still is a keeper with a lot to give. He's fighting for his place. He hasn't just given up and said ""it's your Thibaut"". When he's come in he's had to be brilliant and given the manager food for thought. 'He could play for anyone. He's been different class for us. He's worth 10-12 points every season.'","Chelsea drew 1-1 with PSG at Parc de Princes in Champions League .

"Doctors have battled against the clock to save an unborn baby who was given only 30 minutes to live in her mother's womb. Medics in Norwich realised tiny Imogen Tooke was in trouble only when they carried out a routine scan. They saw that the child had her umbilical wrapped twice around her neck and her heartbeat was plummeting. Relieved mother Melissa Tooke, 30, with her daughter Imogen who was given only 30 minutes to live . Doctors then faced a race against time to deliver Imogen by an emergency operation before it was too late. Luckily, they managed to get the baby out with just minutes to spare. Her relieved mother Melissa, 30, said: 'It is hard to believe that we were just 30 minutes away from losing Imogen. 'It's so lucky that the scan was carried out when it was. If it had been done just half an hour later then it would have been too late to save her. 'That scan saved her life. Luckily the doctors spotted that the umbilical cord was wrapped around her neck and they were able to act fast.' Miss Tooke, who works as a shop assistant, and her partner James Payne, 26, also a shop assistant, were thrilled when they discovered she was pregnant. Her pregnancy went smoothly until 27 weeks when she developed swollen ankles. Doctors spotted that tiny Imogen Tooke was in trouble only when they carried out a routine scan . Doctors then faced a race against time to deliver Imogen by an emergency operation before it was too late . Miss Tooke said: 'At first the doctor said it was due to the hot weather, but the problem persisted and then the midwife advised me to go to hospital for a check up.' Doctors then discovered she was suffering from pre-eclampsia, a rare life-threatening condition and she spent the next four weeks in hospital. She had a scan every other day, and it was a scan at 32 weeks pregnant that revealed that her unborn baby was in danger. Miss Tooke said: 'I'd had a scan two days previously so I was due for another one that day. I hadn't felt her move for a few hours and she wasn't being as lively as usual, but I hadn't thought it was anything to worry about. 'Luckily the scan was carried out first thing in the morning, just after 9am. If it had been done in the afternoon it would have been too late for Imogen.' At the scan in August 2011, the doctors at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital discovered that the umbilical cord had become wrapped twice around the baby's neck. She was rushed down to the operating theatre and put out under general anaesthetic, whilst doctors battled to save Imogen. Miss Tooke was having a scan every other day, and it was a scan at 32 weeks pregnant that revealed that her unborn baby was in danger . Miss Tooke said: 'The last thing I heard was that the baby was in trouble, and then chaos broke out. I was rushed down to the operating theatre and they had to give me a general anaesthetic to deliver my baby as there wasn't any time for anything else.' 'The next thing I knew was waking up a few hours later. My first thought was whether my baby had survived. Mum was by my bedside when I woke up and she told me that the baby was alive and well. It was such a massive relief.' Miss Tooke was then wheeled down to see her tiny daughter, who weighed just 2Ib8, after being born eight weeks premature. She said: 'I couldn't believe how tiny and fragile she was. Her skin was translucent and I could see every one of her tiny ribs. 'Her head fitted in the palm of my hand and I could even fit my ring around her leg, it was so small. 'None of the newborn clothes we had bought for her fitted, so mum had to rush out and buy some dolls clothes. They were the only things that would fit her. Mum even bought her one of the tiny t-shirts that people hang up in the back of their cars. It said 'Princess on Board' and it fitted her perfectly.' After a month in hospital Imogen was allowed home, still only weighing a tiny 3Ibs. Miss Tooke said: 'It was lovely to have her home, but I was terrified as she was still so small and fragile.' Imogen has come in leaps and bounds and is now doing really well. Miss Tooke added: 'It was a day that she may have never seen had it not been for the scan that saved her life. 'It is terrifying to think that if the scan had been just an hour later, then Imogen wouldn't be here with us today. 'She is the most fantastic baby, she's always so happy and smiling. Every day I look at her and know how lucky she has been. When she's older I will tell her about her amazing birth.' Alistair McKelvey, Consultant Obstetrician, at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, said: 'We were very fortunate to find that at a scheduled fetal ultrasound, that baby Imogen was in distress and we had to perform an immediate caesarian delivery to save her. 'It is thankfully very unusual to encounter this situation at an ultrasound scan.'","Imogen Tooke had umbilical wrapped twice around her neck .

"An MP is furious after a pole dancing club owned by international porn baron Larry Flynt offered Pippa Middleton £100,000 - to become a stripper. The club, which is owned by the proprietor of Hustler magazine, is trying to tempt Prince William’s sister-in-law with the six-figure sum to become a 'Hustler Honey'. In a letter posted this week to the website of Hustler Club UK, based in Croydon, south London,  the clubs states she could be 'exempt' from on-stage performances and could instead 'entertain' her guests in its VIP rooms.

"Not all diamonds last forever and some can fade away in just a few seconds, according to new research. The finding contradicts Shirley Bassey’s 1971 James Bond theme song and the popular belief that diamonds last forever - the word ‘diamond’ even means 'unbreakable' in ancient Greek. Scientists used an electron beam to prove that microscopic diamonds in treated coal only survive for seconds before they revert to a form of less exciting carbon. Diamond in the rough: The creation of nanodiamonds in treated coal show that some microscopic diamonds only last seconds before fading back into less-structured forms of carbon under the impact of an electron beam. The dark spots in these images taken using an electron microscope, are nanodiamonds among coal . Researchers at Rice University in Houston, Texas, discovered the effect of the nanodiamonds while they were working on ways to chemically reduce carbon from coal and make it soluble. Nanodiamonds are used in a variety of industrial processes and are increasingly being used in medical research to deliver chemotherapy and improve bone growth, for example. Chemists Ed Billups and Yanqiu Sun first noticed nanodiamonds forming among the shapeless, hydrogen-infused layers of graphite. They took close-up images of the coal with an electron microscope - which fires an electron beam at the point of interest - and found that the energy from the beam congealed clusters of hydrogenated carbon atoms, some of which took on the lattice-like structure of nanodiamonds. Energy from the electron beam congealed clusters of hydrogenated carbon atoms, turning them temporarily to nanodiamonds. This image shows a nanodiamond (the dark spot) reverting to coal . Dr Billups said: ‘The beam is very powerful. To knock hydrogen atoms off of something takes a tremendous amount of energy.’ Even without the kind of pressure needed to make diamonds that can be seen with the naked eye, the energy knocked loose hydrogen atoms to prompt a chain reaction between layers of graphite in the coal. This resulted in diamonds between two and 10 nanometers wide (up to 0.00001mm), according to the study published in the American Chemical Society’s Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters. The duo discovered that most of the diamonds faded away under the power of the electron beam and documented the changes in photos taken over 30 seconds. ‘The small diamonds are not stable and they revert to the starting material - the anthracite [coal],’ Dr Billups said. Scientists have previously discovered that nanodiamonds could be used to promote bone growth and improve the durability of dental implants. The miniscule gems, which are invisible to the human eye, could be used to combat forms of bone loss including osteonecrosis . In the future humans could have diamond-encrusted teeth to improve oral health and fight disease. Scientists discovered in September 2013 that nanodiamonds could be used to promote bone growth and improve the durability of dental implants. The miniscule gems, which are invisible to the human eye, could be used to combat forms of bone loss including osteonecrosis, which is a potentially debilitating disease in which bones break down due to reduced blood flow. Scientists from the UCLA and the NanoCarbon Research Institute in Japan discovered that nanodiamonds - by-products of conventional mining that are four to five nanometers in diameter - could be used as a delivery system for proteins in the mouth as an improved treatment for osteonecrosis. The disease affects the jaw and can prevent people from eating and speaking. Dean Ho, professor of oral biology and medicine at the UCLA School of Dentistry explained that doctors performing bone repair operations, which are typically costly and time consuming, surgically inset a sponge to administer proteins that promote bone growth such as bone morphogenic protein. His team discovered that using nanodiamonds to deliver these proteins could be more effective in administering the proteins as they quickly bind to the bone. The unique surface of the diamonds allows the proteins to be delivered more slowly, which may allow the affected area to be treated for a longer period of time. Furthermore, the nanodiamonds can be administered non-invasively, such as by an injection or even an oral rinse.","Researchers at Rice University in Houston, Texas, created the nanodiamonds in treated coal using a powerful electron beam .

"A penthouse at the former Sony building on Madison Avenue in New York is set to become the city’s most expensive listing at $150million according to therealdeal.com – and it doesn’t even have a backyard or a roof terrace. But it does have 21,000-square-feet of floor space, eight bedrooms, eight bathrooms and 10 powder rooms. The triplex will occupy floors 33 through 35 of the 37-storey tower and its price is set to eclipse that paid for the current record holder – 57 St’s One57 overlooking Central Park, which went for a staggering $100.47million. Scroll down for video . A penthouse at the former Sony building on Madison Avenue in New York is set to become the city’s most expensive listing at $150million . The apartment, in the Philip Johnson-designed building between 55th and 56th streets, is being built by real estate powerhouse the Chetrit Group and Clipper Equity. The new owner will enter through a private elevator to living quarters worth about $6,975 per square foot, according to therealdeal.com. Viewed this way it’s not worth as much as a new triplex coming on the market atop 520 Park Avenue. This will be listed for less - $130million – but will be worth $10,489 per square foot. The owner of the Madison Avenue apartment will enjoy a gym and spa, a billiards room, wine room, media room, a library, a huge master bedroom with an adjacent study and a gallery for hanging art. The commute for staff will be very short indeed - they get their own bedrooms and bathroom on the lower level. Blueprints: These plans, first published exclusively in therealdeal.com, show that the new owner will have a gym, spa, billiards room, wine room and a media room. Plus quarters for staff (pictured is the bottom level) Roomy: On the middle level is a dining room, kitchen, living room and a library, plus access via the stairs to the first and third floors . Top of the heap: The luxurious apartment also boasts several guest bedrooms and a gigantic master bedroom that has its own private study . The rest of Sony’s former headquarters will be transformed into 96 high-spec condos, bringing the total value of the development to around $1.8billion. The Madison Avenue penthouse, while very expensive, is still much cheaper than the $237million paid for an apartment at the exclusive One Hyde Park development in London. Apartments there start at $10million and owners enjoy sumptuous shared features including a cinema, a 21m swimming pool, saunas, a gym, a golf simulator, a wine cellar and a valet service. Residents can call on valets, a concierge and butler room service from the next-door Mandarin Oriental hotel's two restaurants, overseen by Heston Blumenthal and Daniel Boulud. The development also contains three boutiques which include Rolex and McLaren. The next highest listing in New York is for $118million for three condominiums at the Ritz-Carlton in Battery Park City. Someone paid a staggering $100.47million for a 10,923-square-foot penthouse apartment occupying the entire 89th and 90th floors of One57, the high-end skyscraper apartment building that overlooks Central Park. This is the most ever paid for a New York apartment . World's most expensive property: An apartment at London's exclusive One Hyde Park development sold for $237million .

Whitney  now has an army of fans who are helping her to spread her message of body acceptance . Whitney in a dance studio with friend Todd Beasley who appears with her in some of her dances . After a lifetime of weight anxiety and eating disorders, Whitney launched the No Body Shame Campaign to fight fat phobia six months ago. Since then she has received messages of support from all over the world from people inspired by her self-confidence. Whitney, from Greenboro, North Carolina, said: 'Six months ago I would never have gone out in public and put my body on show. 'Becoming body positive has been the most incredible thing that's ever happened to me. 'I get messages of support from all over the world from fat people saying thank you. Her childhood passion for dance was cut short after weight gain in her teenage years shook her confidence . Whitney, pictured on stage aged 16, gained weight throughout her teenage years, weighing 18st at 18 . Whitney's battle with her weight resulted in her suffering bulimia and anorexia in her early twenties . 'It's mind blowing to me that loving yourself when you're fat is seen as so subversive. Whitney's childhood passion for dance was cut short after weight gain in her teenage years shook her confidence. At 18 she weighed 18st and, crippled with insecurity about her appearance, she battled bulimia and anorexia in her early twenties. She said: 'In my first year of college I gained 100lb and basically stopped doing everything I loved. 'I internalised a lot of shame because of my weight and even forced myself to throw up after meals.' Throughout her twenties Whitney's weight fluctuated but she tried to stay fit, returning to her love of dance. Despite her body image issue, Whitney tried to stay fit throughout her twenties, continuing ot dance . Whitney launched the No Body Shame Campaign in December to tackle prejudices against fat people . Later she was diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), an incurable condition which can cause weight gain, excessive hair growth and infertility. She said: 'I'd never heard of PCOS, which is crazy because it affects around 10 per cent of women. 'By this time I'd internalised a lot of shame about my body so it was really wasn't a stretch for me to feel bad about myself. 'Society is constantly reinforcing that fat people are lazy, stupid, worthless, talentless and not allowed to be sexy.' Whitney launched the No Body Shame Campaign in December to tackle prejudices against fat people and to encourage people to love their body no matter the size. Whitney was surprised at the reaction to her videos, which have seen messages of support flooding in from across the world . She said: 'I have no fear of the F word, and for me the F word is fat. 'That's something I want to address: you can be fat and beautiful, fat and funny, fat and smart, fat and talented - nobody thinks that these two things can go together.' And after putting her energetic dance videos online she was surprised by the reaction. 'It's mind blowing to me that loving yourself when you're fat is seen as so subversive,' Whitney says . She said: 'My co-worker Jared Pike suggested putting the video online because fat girls are really popular on the internet. 'It . started being shared on Facebook and people weren't posting it to say . 'haha, lets make fun of this girl' which is what I would think.' 'They were actually posting it to say 'yeah, this girls awesome' and I was just feeling all this love from all over the place. 'Then it went viral and I was really surprised at how positive the reaction was.' While most of the feedback has been positive, Whitney has been accused of promoting obesity. She said: ""No Body Shame Campaign just promotes loving yourself. 'I've been thin, I've had eating disorders, I've been kinda fat, really fat and super fat and the thing that stayed with me always was shame. 'It's not unique to fat people, this is a problem that everyone encounters and you don't have to feel that way. 'The purpose of the campaign is to love yourself first then you can affect positive change then you can sustain it.'","Had a childhood passion for dance, but stopped when she gained weight .

"Movita Castaneda, the raven-haired actress who met Marlon Brando on a movie set and later married him and had two of his children, has died. Barbara Sternig, a family friend, says Castaneda died last Thursday at a Los Angeles rehabilitation center after being treated for a neck injury. The Los Angeles Times says Castaneda was believed to be 98. There is debate as to what year she was born, as her age was inflated during her time as an actress. She married Brando in 1960 and the two stayed together until 1962 when he fell in love with his costar while remaking 'Mutiny on the Bounty' - the very movie that made Castaneda a star. However, Brando and Castaneda later had a second child together in 1966. Scroll down for video .

"Preston North End goalkeeper Thorsten Stuckmann has claimed Wayne Rooney apologised for the 'dive' that won Manchester United a penalty during their FA Cup fifth-round tie. Rooney went down under a challenge by Stuckmann in the 88th minute, and the England captain scored the resulting penalty to seal the 3-1 win over their League One opposition on Monday night. Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker and Stan Collymore were among those criticising Rooney after replays showed there was no contact. Wayne Rooney touched the ball past Preston North End goalkeeper Thorsten Stuckman during the FA Cup tie . Rooney went down a moment after and several of the Preston players were unhappy with his actions . Rooney lies down on the ground before the penalty is given by referee Phil Dowd late on at Deepdale . Rooney scored from the spot-kick to put Manchester United 3-1 up on Monday night as they won the match . 'After the game Rooney told me: ""Sorry, it was my chance to get a penalty. I had to use that"",' Stuckmann told The Sun. England manager Roy Hodgson was forced to defend his captain and Stuckmann remains adamant it was an unfair call by referee Phil Dowd. 'I say it clear: That was no penalty,' the keeper added. 'I also believe that if the situation had happened the other way around, one of our strikers against the United keeper, the ref wouldn't have given the penalty. I have no doubt about that.' The goal was Rooney's first in 952 minutes since scoring twice in the 3-1 win over Newcastle United on Boxing Day, and United will now face Arsenal in the FA Cup quarter-finals. Gary Lineker wrote this on Twitter and discussed it further with England manager Roy Hodgson on BBC . Gary Lineker: Roy, he's your captain. Was he diving there? Roy Hodgson: No, not for me, he's just taking evasive action. If you're refereeing the game without the replays that we've seen now a number of times, I don't think any of us would have said that's not a penalty. The goalkeeper's come out that way very rashly and gone with both feet, and Wayne's touched the ball past him. Lineker: But he hasn't touched him Roy? Hodgson: Well...there you go . Kevin Kilbane: Well there’s no contact. It’s a rash challenge yes, but there’s no contact. He tries to leave his leg in there as well, just looking for it. Phil Neville: I think when the keeper’s flying in like that he has to get out of the way. And yeah you might say it’s a dive, but I think he had to get out of the way because if he had left his leg in there it’d have been a leg-breaker. Kilbane: It’s still a dive though. Neville: He had to dive to get out of the way, though. Kilbane: But it’s a dive, Phil. Neville: He had to get out of the way otherwise he’d have snapped his leg. Kilbane: He can hurdle the challenge though can’t he, and then continue his run. Neville: It’s a penalty for me – it’s a reckless challenge.

"Brendan Rodgers has expressed his deep disappointment that Lazar Markovic has been given a four-match ban and described the punishment as 'harsh'. The Liverpool midfielder was sent-off against Basle in the final Champions League game in December for an innocuous hand flick but UEFA only revealed his punishment yesterday. It means Liverpool will be without Markovic for both legs of their Europa League last 32 contest against Besiktas and, potentially, both legs of the last 16 also and it a suspension that his manager believes is unjust. Lazar Markovic pushes out his arm towards Behrang Safari's face in the clash with Basle in December . Brendan Rodgers speaks to the press ahead of Liverpool's clash with Besiktas on Thursday night at Anfield . 'We are obviously disappointed with the length of the ban,” said Rodgers. 'We felt it was very harsh but we accept it and unfortunately he won’t be able to contribute. Hopefully he will play many more European games for the club.' Rodgers, whose side are enjoying their best run of form of the campaign, is relishing the chance to get back into European competition and is not in the least bit concerned about a reunion with Demba Ba, the striker who blew a hole in their quest to win the Barclays Premier League when he played for Chelsea. 'It won’t stimulate any bad memories for me. He scored a goal. We will pay him respect but nothing more than that.” said Rodgers. Daniel Sturridge and Rodgers talk to the press ahead of their Europa League game with Besiktas on Thursday . 'He has been a very good player and had a fruitful period in England - a wonderful player who scores goals and he has done well at Besiktas.' Daniel Sturridge, meanwhile, is determined to carry on building his fitness up and sees this game as an opportunity to continue his momentum. 'Every competition is important for us. We take each game as it comes. We will play our football and look to get good results,' said Sturridge. 'I have got no worries, no stresses at all. I am enjoying my football and if selected I will continue to do my best for the team. 'It is important to get a relationship with every player, whether it is Mario, Simon Mignolet or whoever. I am just doing my best to help the team. I look forward to continuing playing between now and the end of the season. Sturridge is determined to build his fitness and sees the game as a chance to continue his momentum . 'I think the setup is different but the mentality is always the same. We are going in with that mentality and it is important for us as a team. That is what will bring us success in the future. 'It is easy to play with Mario and any of my team-mates. I feel like I can play him or anybody, it is up to the manager. I like Mario and I will do my best to help the team.' Of the challenge Besiktas and Ba present, Sturridge added: 'I know they are a good side from watching the videos. I don't see them every week but I know that it is a good game for us, very difficult. It will be a great game for everybody in the stadium. 'He has got a good goalscoring record from his time in England. But we are not trying to concentrate on individuals. We are just going to play the Liverpool way.' The duo admitted there will be no hard feelings towards former Chelsea striker Demba Ba on Thursday night .","Lazar Markovic was sent off in Liverpool's final Champions League match .

"Chinese scientists predict stem cells obtained from urine could allow humans to regrow lost teeth. The Chinese Academy of Sciences has created tooth-like structures in mice and believes one day bioengineered 'tooth buds' could be transplanted into humans who have lost their teeth. The primitive tooth-like structures are the first solid tissues to be developed using a technique in which discarded cells from human waste can be coaxed into becoming stem cells. The Chinese Academy of Sciences has created tooth-like structures in mice. The primitive teeth-like organs are the first solid organs or tissue to be developed using a technique where discarded cells from human waste can be coaxed into becoming stem cells . The scientists used a new system of tissue culture to grow cells into tiny structures resembling teeth, which they implanted into mice. The stem cells were generated from urine, based on previous studies which have shown discarded cells in human waste can be coaxed into becoming pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These can then themselves generate many different cell types, including neurons and heart muscle cells. According to Cell Regeneration Journal, the tooth buds are the first solid organs or tissues made from iPSCs. The scientists said the method could be used to create a bioengineered tooth bud that could be cultured in vitro then transplanted into the jawbone of a needy patient to form a fully functional tooth . Dr Duanqing Pei, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, created the tooth-like structures by forcing iPSCs to mimic two different cell types: epithelial cells, which give rise to enamel, and mesenchymal cells, which give rise to the other three main components of teeth - dentin, cementum and pulp. He first created flat sheets of epithelial cells which the researchers then mixed with mouse embryonic mesenchymal cells. The product of their labours was transplanted into mice, and three weeks later, tooth-like structures had grown. Dr Pei said: 'The primitive teeth-like organs are structurally and physically similar to human teeth. 'They are of roughly the same elasticity, and contain pulp, dentin and enamel-forming cells. 'But the method has its limitations - it involves mouse cells, has a success rate of around 30 per cent and the structures were about one-third of the hardness of human teeth.' The scientists used a new system of tissue culture to grow cells into tiny structures resembling teeth, which they implanted into mice. The stem cells were generated from urine, based on previous studies which have shown discarded cells in human waste can be coaxed into becoming pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) The researchers believe that tweaking the mixture of cells and the condition of the culture tissue could solve these problems. They said: 'The revised method could, in theory, be used to create a bioengineered tooth bud that could be cultured in vitro then transplanted into the jawbone of a needy patient to form a fully functional tooth.' Cells generated from a patient's urine would not be rejected by the host recipient, as they would be derived from the host's own cellular material' the scientists said. They believe iPSCs remain a great source of hope for regenerative medicine.","Chinese scientists have created tiny 'tooth buds' that have been transplanted into mice and grown into tooth-like structures .

"Checklist: Leon Reid told police he had never had to force entry into a home . Get a dog and a shingled patio – a serial burglar has drawn up a checklist revealing his top tips to avoid a break in. Police say Leon Reid has burgled at least 70 homes but never forced entry and was only caught out by DNA evidence. Before Reid was jailed for five years on Wednesday at Woolwich Crown Court he handed over his checklist list to police on how not to be burgled. The 32-year-old career criminal, who admitted one burglary and asked for 29 others to be taken into consideration, even told officers his list should be added to the Met’s crime prevention leaflets, The Daily Telegraph reports. His list, which was written before he was sentenced, detailed the types of houses Reid, of New Cross, south London, avoids. It states any sign of a dog would put most burglar's off as well as a pebbled or shingled drive, because of the crunching noise. Lighting was also a major deterrent, including motion senor lighting. Other top tips for homeowners include investing in anti-climb paint, getting some CCTV or an alarm box. Jailed: Before Leon Reid was sentenced at Woolwich Crown Court on Wednesday he handed over a check-list of trade secrets to police . A dog or a sign warning of a dog: Burglars will not risk entry if there is even a 'hint of a pet pooch . Pebble drives or shingled patios: These make it difficult when approaching a house because of the noise . Alarms: Even if the alarm box is a fake, Reid told police he never raided a home with a burglar alarm box . CCTV: Reid said burglars avoided homes with cameras . Wire on gates and anti-climb paint: They make it difficult and 'messy' for burglars . Well-lit: Reid said if there were any lights on he avoided the home . Motion sensor lighting: Lights outside which could go one as soon as anyone walked by was a major deterrent for Reid . And Reid, who once had an ear bitten off by a police dog while fleeing a burglary near his home, would avoid a home even if he suspected the CCTV or alarm box was fake. Detective . Chief Inspector Paul Astbury, who is based in Lewisham, told The Telegraph: . ‘What is compelling about Reid’s offending is that during all of his . 70-plus offences dating back to 2006 he has never forced entry. ‘He entered through open windows and doors of premises that did not have one of his list of ‘deterrents’. It speaks volumes really.’ The force said it will use the information Reid has handed over to reinforce crime prevention tips to residents but did not comment on whether Reid’s list would be published. Burglar victim Tom Ellis-Scott, 34, of Streatham, south London, who was burgled four years ago, told the paper: ‘It may seem like simple advice, but when it comes down to it this from the point of view of a crook so is worth heeding.’",Leon Reid was only caught by DNA evidence .
"Busted: David Roberts falsely claimed more than £18,000 in disability benefits before he was caught working as a judo instructor . A man who falsely claimed more than £18,000 in disability benefits was caught out working as a judo instructor. David Roberts received the highest rate of mobility-based disability allowance after claiming he had crippling back pain, was practically wheelchair-bound and could not wash himself, shower or go to the toilet unaided. But the 47-year-old was filmed in an undercover sting operation by the Department of Work and Pensions working as a judo sensei, hurling a student across a practice mat. Roberts, a fifth-dan black belt, pleaded guilty to dishonestly failing to disclose information at Warrington Crown Court. He was given a six month sentence, suspended for a year, and ordered to undertake 200 hours of unpaid work. Warrington . Crown Court heard how Roberts claimed he was crippled by a bad back and . arthritis in his legs which left him in constant pain. But . while claiming benefits he was also teaching judo to classes in Runcorn . and Frodsham, Cheshire, at the Go Dojo Judo school he established in . 2002. The DWP undercover . surveillance team filmed him carrying heavy loads from his car, as well . as training with students by repeatedly throwing them to the ground. Sarah Griffin, prosecuting, said: . 'During his claim he was observed by officers walking significant . distances, carrying heavy equipment, teaching children and could clearly . stand up without difficulty. 'He . was interviewed by police and denied any change to his condition before . he was shown evidence including video, photos and a print out from a . website naming him as an instructor.'

"The former Marine who shot dead famed Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle is still receiving $2,800 a month in Veterans Affairs benefits, it emerged in court on Tuesday. Eddie Ray Routh, 27, is on trial for gunning down Kyle and his friend, Chad Littlefield, at a Texas shooting range two years ago. He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Routh received $30,000 in back-pay benefits after he was arrested and will continue to get his monthly payout unless he is convicted of murder - and then he'll receive 10 per cent, around $280 a month, the New York Post reported. On Tuesday, prosecutors quizzed his mother, Jodi Routh, on the money, which he began receiving after the VA determined he was disabled following the shootings. Payouts: The government continues to pay accused murderer Eddie Ray Routh, pictured in court on Tuesday, $2,800 a month in Veterans Affairs disability payments, it emerged in court . Mrs Routh said it is being held in a bank account that she manages with her husband. Prosecutors said some of the money has gone toward a down payment for a house Routh's sister bought with her husband, but Mrs Routh said she was unaware of that, the Post reported. The matter was discussed once jurors were out of the room. District Judge Jason Cashon held a brief hearing on whether Routh was still qualified for his three court-appointed lawyers. The judge told Mrs Routh not to touch the money, or allow anyone else to touch it. He said he will rule on the issue later this week. On Tuesday, the prosecution wrapped up their testimony in the trial in Stephenville, Texas. On Wednesday, defense attorneys are presenting their first full day of testimony. Mrs Routh was their first witness on Tuesday. She testified that she had reached out to Kyle for help with her troubled son after reading his book, but did not know they were going to the shooting range. Under cross-examination, prosecutors asked Jodi Routh if she regretted not telling Kyle of threats Routh had made to kill himself and his family. On Tuesday, Jodi Routh recounted her son's mental anguish and stints in facilities before the killings . 'I was just looking for help for my son,' she responded. Kyle, the famed former Navy SEAL sniper who served four tours in Iraq, and his friend Chad Littlefield were shot dead at the range in February 2013. Routh then stole Kyle's truck and was arrested following a police chase. Eddie Ray Routh has pleaded not guilty, and his attorneys are mounting an insanity defense. There is no doubt over the fact that Routh shot the men dead. Instead, the prosecution is trying to show that he was aware of what he was doing, while the defense claims he was in a psychotic state. Family members have said he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq and in Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake. The court has also heard how he smoked marijuana and may have consumed whiskey before heading to the shooting range with Kyle and Littlefield, but voluntary intoxication is not a defense. Prosecutors have also contended that he knew right from wrong. A Texas Ranger testified that authorities also found anti-psychotic medication for schizophrenia while searching Routh's home after the shooting. Victims: Chris Kyle, left, and Chad Littlefield, right, were both shot multiple times on February 2, 2013 . In court: Kyle's wife, Taya Kyle, is seen in court during the trial in Stephenville, Texas on Tuesday . Last week, a former deputy testified that he overheard Routh after he'd been taken into custody say that he shot the men because they wouldn't talk to him as the three drove together to the shooting range. The court also heard this week how Routh became irritated when Littlefield was not shooting. 'Are you gonna shoot? Are you gonna shoot? It's a shooting sport. You shoot,' Routh said in a phone call to a New Yorker reporter after the killings. 'That's what got me all riled up.' In his taped confession, he also said he was fearful that if he didn't shoot the men, whom he called 'headhunters', then they would turn on him. 'If I didn't take out his soul, he was going to take my soul next,' Routh said. The trial has drawn intense interest, partly because of an Oscar-nominated film based on Kyle's memoir.","Routh is on trial for gunning down Chris Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield in 2013 as he struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder .

"Fiddler: Ian Harrison's job at the Department of Work and Pensions was to investigate dole fiddlers and bring them to justice . Ian Harrison could never be accused of not wanting to take his work home with him. His job at the Department of Work and Pensions was to make key decisions on benefit payouts and help root out fraudsters. But the former policeman ended up in the dock himself for fraudulently claiming over £10,500 in disability benefits for a 'bad back' - the very swindle he was employed to prevent. He claimed that a back injury suffered . during his police career meant he could only walk 40 yards in three . minutes and could not wash or shower properly. However, colleagues in the DWP grew . suspicious and mounted surveillance on him filming the 70-year-old . walking his dog and going shopping. He was soon arrested for fraudulently claiming £10,672 in Disability Living Allowance. Huw Edwards, prosecuting for the DWP, . told the court: 'In his job Harrison would look at people’s claims, he . would take statements and give evidence in court against fraudsters. 'But, all that time he was claiming himself. The DWP started surveillance on him and had him covertly filmed. 'In addition to the video footage some . twenty of his colleagues were asked about his condition at work and . some said he had been moving around freely at work and did not need a . stick. 'But none of them knew he was claiming . Disabled Living Allowance at the higher rate and it was clear to them . that he would not have been entitled to such benefits.' The magistrates watched footage of . Harrison walking with ease, pushing a shopping trolley and taking his . dog on a lead on a trip to the Lake District. Scroll down for video . Fraud: Harrison pushes a shopping trolley with ease. However, colleagues in the DWP grew suspicious and mounted surveillance on him filming the 70-year-old walking his dog and going shopping . Harrison pleaded guilty to failing to tell the DWP . about a change in his circumstances - namely a change in his physical . capabilities and that his mobility needs had decreased knowing that . would have affected his entitlement to State benefits. Allan Godwin, defending, said his . client had suffered an injury while working as a policeman and had since . suffered anxiety and depression. The lawyer said: 'This is not all a . figment of his imagination. He even had to have a specially designed . desk at work to assist him. Sprightly: The magistrates watched footage of Harrison walking with ease, pushing a shopping trolley and taking his dog on a lead on a trip to the Lake District . 'When he was working for the DWP he . took time off work sick and his GP told him to get out and about more. He found his condition improved as a result. It is all a matter of . degrees of improvement, but he does accept he should not have continued . on the higher rate allowance. 'Over the time he got better when he thought he would get worse.

"The grieving husband of a Las Vegas mother shot dead following a road rage incident has come out in defense of his son, who police now say accompanied his mother with gun in hand to help search for the man who eventually killed her. 'My son is not an animal,' Robert Meyers told mourners at a Tuesday vigil for his wife Tammy Meyers. 'My son is a hero in my book.' 'There were mistakes made like every one of us have made in our life, but this particular mistake was made to keep a bigger mistake from happening.' Defended son: Robert Meyers defended his son, who chased down an angry motorist in Las Vegas who subsequently shot and killed his Mr Meyers' wife Tammy . 'My son is not an animal,' Robert Meyers said at the Tuesday vigil for Tammy Meyers. 'My son is a hero in my book' Searched for driver: Police now say 44-year-old Tammy Meyers had her teenage daughter run in the house to fetch her armed son Brandon (seen here at the vigil), who then went with her as she drove to find the driver . In a change from earlier accounts, police Lt. Ray Steiber said 44-year-old Tammy Meyers had her teenage daughter run in the house to fetch her armed son, who then went with her as she drove to find the driver who had earlier stopped his car in front of hers, got out and approached her with angry words. His son, Brandon Meyers, also defended himself at his mother's vigil, reports NBCLA. 'I did what I had to do to protect my family. Everyone can think what they have to think; I did it for a reason. And I'd do it for anyone I love,' Brandon Meyers said. When asked to characterize Tammy Meyers' five-to-10 minute drive through the neighborhood, Lieutenant Steibner said Tuesday that police in the investigation 'would never say that anybody went looking for trouble,' Kristal Meyers, left, and her brother, Robert Meyes Jr. spoke at a memorial vigil for their mom on Tuesday night at Walter Johnson Junior High School, where Meyers had been giving her 15-year-old daughter a driving lesson . Dozens gathered in the parking lot at Johnson Junior High School, where police said Meyers was giving her daughter driving lessons on Thursday night before a near-collision led to the deadly confrontation . No one has been arrested in the killing, and the family is offering a 1965 Chevrolet El Camino as a reward in exchange for information leading to catching Tammy Meyers' killer . Armed: Brandon Meyers fired shots at the fleeing car with his handgun as his mother lay dying nearby . Son: Brandon Meyers, 22, posted a photo of a Beretta handgun (right) to his Facebook page one year ago, saying: 'New addition to the family.' Police say he shot at the fleeing car after his mom was gunned down . He said she found, and for a time followed, the vehicle she had apparently been looking for. Tammy Meyers then drove home, Steiber said, where a vehicle described only as a four-door gray or silver sedan pulled up and someone inside opened fire. 'Unfortunately I cannot say what was in Tammy's mind,' the police lieutenant said. 'Tammy is the victim.' Steiber said the initial road rage incident happened while Tammy Myers drove slowly home from a school parking lot, where she had been teaching her teenage daughter to drive. The girl didn't have a learner's permit. Steiber said the daughter told police a car sped up to them from behind and then pulled alongside. The daughter reached over from the passenger seat and honked the car horn at the car as it passed. Suspect: A twenty-something man with spiky hair, while Kristal Meyers holds a candle during a memorial vigil for her mother on Tuesday night . Shot dead: Mother-of-four Tammy Meyers, 44, went home first before heading back out to find the man that eventually killed her following a road rage incident last Thursday, police say . Killed: Tammy Meyers - seen here with her husband Robert Meyers - went out looking for a man she had a road rage argument with, cops said. She was accompanied by their son Brandon, 22, who brought a gun with him, according to authorities . 'She figured this person was speeding, and right or wrong, they needed to be corrected,' Steiber said of the girl, who he said is 15. 'She honked the horn.' Steiber pointed to a police artist's sketch of a man sought for questioning. He said the man is believed to be in his mid-20s with blond hair and blue or hazel eyes, and was wearing a V-neck T-shirt. 'All indications to us are that this unknown person fired first,' Steiber said. He said Brandon Meyers returned fire. Tammy Meyers was behind her son, and Steiber said police don't believe he was responsible for the fatal shot. On the run: The surveillance footage above shows a four-door sedan wanted by police in connection to a deadly shooting last week in Las Vegas .

"EastEnders' week-long 30th anniversary celebrations were thrown into jeopardy last night after a stray firework sparked a huge blaze on the Albert Square set. The first of four special semi-live episodes kicked off on Tuesday, which will culminate in a fully live show revealing who killed Lucy Beale on Friday. But off-screen, things were heating up on set after a  firework set fire to Dr Legg's old surgery- just hours after millions of viewers tuned in to watch the explosive storyline. Firefighters rushed to the BBC's Elstree Studios after reports one of the buildings in the Albert Square set was on fire and found the first floor and roof space were filled with flames . Firefighters rushed to the BBC's Elstree Studios after reports one of the buildings in the Albert Square set was on fire and found the first floor and roof space were filled with flames. A spokesman for Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue Service said two crews from nearby Potters Bar and Borehamwood were scrambled to tackle the blaze late last night. 'Crews from Borehamwood and Potters Bar were called to the BBC Elstree Studios shortly after 11pm to tackle a fire that had taken hold in the first floor and roof space of a building on Albert Square,' he added. It is believed that the fire was started accidentally by a firework. A spokeswoman for the soap said: 'There was a very small fire on set on Tuesday night after rehearsals had finished. The blaze began at the old surgery of Dr Harold Legg, played by Leonard Fenton, who was Walford's original GP and featured on the show between 1985 and 1989 . The drama took place just hours after the filming of the first of four special 30th anniversary live episodes which will reveal who killed Lucy Beale, played by Hetti Bywater (pictured) 'It has not affected any Live week plans and nobody was harmed.' The blaze began at the old surgery of Dr Harold Legg, played by Leonard Fenton, who was Walford's original GP and featured on the show between 1985 and 1989. The roof and interior of the surgery were badly damaged but area commander Ian Parkhouse insisted that the quick response of firefighters meant that no serious damage was caused to the set and the live shows would not be affected. 'Thanks to the hard work of our firefighters, the fire was contained and extinguished before it could cause any serious damage to the set,' he said. 'We're pleased that we were able to deal with this incident quickly, so it shouldn't affect the 30 year celebrations taking place this week.' The week-long celebration of the long-running soap kicked off with a special edition of The Graham Norton Show on Tuesday before the four live shows began on the same evening, building up to a fully-live show finale on Friday. The episodes will reveal who killed Lucy Beale, with the killer being unmasked in an hour long special on Thursday before a fully live 30 minute finale on Friday night. The character of Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater) was found dead in the soap last Easter . Fans have been desperate to find out who was behind the murder of Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater) who was discovered dead on Walford Common from a deliberately inflicted head injury on 18 April 2014. At the end of the first live episode, Max Branning (Jake Wood) confronted his daughter Abi (Lorna Fitzgerald) and accused her of being the killer. Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa) struggled to cope after discovering the murder's true identity after piecing together the clues in detective Emma Summerhayes' case file. Long-term fans of the show have been suspicious of Max and Abi for some time, as they have been covering up what they were really doing when Lucy was murdered on Good Friday. Despite the Abi bombshell, it was heavily hinted the blame could lie with a member of the Beale family. Lauren wrote an anonymous message to Jane in her wedding card, which read: 'I know what happened to Lucy. 'She was killed at home.' She also refused to reconcile with boyfriend Peter Beale- Lucy's twin. Ian Beale also raised suspicions after expressing how guilty he feels. 'I don’t deserve to be happy', he lamented. Lucy's killer will finally be revealed during Friday's live episode.","Fire crews were called to a fire at Dr Legg's old surgery in Albert Square .

"Oscar-nominated actress Michelle Williams appeared in a Brooklyn court Tuesday to offer evidence against her filmmaker friend's former boyfriend in a vicious custody battle rife with allegations of cheating, arsenic poisoning and gruesome dismemberment fantasies. New York-based novelist and movie producer Galt Niederhoffer, 38, and her former partner, prominent corporate attorney Jonathan Gordon, 40, are locked in a legal war over their 2-year-old son. Niederhoffer lost custody of the toddler last month after her own father, financial investor and former squash champion Victor Niederhoffer, took Gordon’s side in the legal tug-of-war and accused his daughter of being a danger to his grandchild. Legal tug-of-war: Writer and producer Galt Niederhoffer (left) is locked in a custody battle over her 2-year-old son with her ex-boyfriend, Jonathan Gordon . Famous friend: Actress Michelle Williams arrived wrote in an affidavit that Gordon, a high-powered attorney,  was tremendously angry and emotionally manipulative . In her affidavit filed in Brooklyn Supreme Court Tuesday and cited by the New York Post, Michelle Williams, 34, painted Gordon as a verbally abusive and rage-filled man. 'To be around Jonathan is to be in the presence of a tremendous and unsettling amount of anger that is barely held below the surface,' the star of Blue Valentine wrote. Williams accused Gordon of humiliating the mother of his child in her presence and waging what she described as 'psychological warfare' against her. Williams, who had a daughter in 2005 with the late actor Heath Ledger, said that she and Niederhoffer became very close in the last couple of years because their daughters are nearly the same age. Ms Williams sat by her friend's side in court Tuesday but did not testify during the hearing. Besides the award-winning actress, movie magnate Harvey Weinstein also has come out in support of Niederhoffer, praising her as a devoted mother in a letter submitted as part of the case. Family feud: Niederhoffer's own father, investor Victor Niederhoffer (left), has come out agaisnt his daughter, claiming she was in need of mental help and was a danger to her son . Hollywood heavyweight: Niederhoffer is best known for producing the 2010 film The Romantics, based on an eponymous novel she published in 2008 . Ms Niederhoffer, a Harvard-educated filmmaker and mother of three, is best known for producing the 2010 film 'The Romantics' starring Katie Holmes, Josh Duhamel and Anna Paquin. The movie was based on an eponymous novel she published in 2008. In court documents, Niederhoffer accused her ex-boyfriend, the in-house counsel for media mogul Barry Diller, of repeatedly cheating on her and lacing her food with arsenic. Gordon responded to the allegations by calling his ex mentally ill and in need of psychiatric care - a claim backed by her own father. However, a blood test conducted at New York Presbyterian Hospital in January found potentially toxic levels on arsenic in Niederhoffer's sytem. The high-profile attorney said Niederhoffer began falsely accusing him of infidelity in 2013, about two years into their relationship. The 38-year-old producer stated in legal documents that her boyfriend used to dream about killing her, chopping up her body and dumping the remains behind their home in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn. Close friends: Williams (left), who had a daughter in 2005 with the late actor Heath Ledger, said that she and Niederhoffer became close in the last couple of years because their girls are nearly the same age . Niederhodffer, whose 2005 novel A Taxonomy of Barnacles is currently being adapted for the big screen with a star-studded cast, has compared her predicament to the 1944 noir classic Gaslight, where a husband attempts to convince his wife, played by Ingrid Bergman, that she is going insane. According to Ms Niederhoffer, in November 2014, Gordon picked up for her some odd-smelling whitefish. Suspicious, she sent the food to a lab for testing, and the toxicology report allegedly showed high levels of arsenic and other heavy metals. The same poison was also discovered in her blood. The already acrimonious custody battle is further complicated by assault charges against Niederhoofder, who allegedly slammed her stepmother's head against the wall following a court hearing. Jonathan Gordon is also facing legal troubles after allegedly trying to choke his ex-girlfriend in bed last month.","Galt Niederhoffer, 38, is locked in custody battle over her 2-year-old son with her ex-boyfriend, attorney Jonathan Gordon .

"ISIS morality police attacked a young Syrian woman dressed in a full burkha and face veil - because they thought her eyes were too exposed. The Al-Merced NGO said the woman was arrested in Albuhamal, in the east of the country, along with two men who tried to protect her. The charity also claimed women living in Mosul who offended the militant group's strict dress code were being beaten by iron rods, Israel National News reports. Strict: Women living under ISIS control must abide by rules governing their dress, which is enforced by morality police in each city. The Al-Merced NGO reports one group beat a woman for showing too much eye . Women living  in ISIS-controlled territory in Syria and Iraq are made to follow strict rules, which they claim are based on Sharia law. The Guardian has reported the group demands women  wear double-layered veils, loose abayas and gloves. They are also made to go everywhere with a male guardian. But it is not just women who are made to live within draconian laws. Last month, ISIS published a code of conduct - including which horrific punishment went with each crime. For example, those who commit adultery will be stoned to death if the adulterer was married and lashed 100 times and exiled if he or she was unmarried. Those engaged in sodomy (homosexuality) will be sentenced to death, along with those who 'spy for the unbelievers'. Those who steal 'as part of banditry' will have their right hand and left leg cut off, and the punishment for terrorising people is exile. Beating: This boy was lashed 60 times for calling ISIS 'Daesh' - a name with negative connotations . People can also be punished for more minor infringements - including a boy last week, who was flogged 60 times for using the word 'Daesh' - a loose acronym for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (al-Dawla Al-Islamiya al-Iraq al-Sham), used by the enemies of ISIS and seen as having negative connotations. Enforcing the lesser rules - like dress code - is a job given to the morality police. Last year, it was reported Aqsa Mahmood, 20, of Glasgow, was a key figure behind the morality police in Raqqa, Syria - known as the al-Khanssaa brigade. It is thought the women were charged with seeking out people engaging in Western culture in Raqqa.","Woman attacked and two men arrested in Syria, Al-Merced NGO reports .

"These are the chilling images of an abandoned amusement park that shut down after a boy lost his ARM on a ride. Dadipark amusement park, Dadizele, Belgium, closed its doors more than 10-years ago after a young boy had his arm ripped off on the Nautic Jet water ride. Kris Van de Sande, 28, captured the eerie pictures of the abandoned rides at the fairground where they were left to rust and covered in graffiti. Scroll down for video . Creepy: Dadipark, Belgium, has been closed for over a decade . Uneasy: The fact that many of the 'attractions' remain only add to the chilling atmosphere . The freelance photographer, from Hasselt, Belgium, said the whole park had been 'invaded by nature' after being left untouched since closing 12 years ago. He said: 'A boy lost his arm on the nautical jet attraction 14 years ago. 'After that people started to complain about safety in the park. 'Visitor numbers dwindled and the park closed in 2002 for major renovations, but never reopened. 'Several groups started to try and re-open the park, but their attempts weren't fruitful. 'There were a lot of plants around because nature had been left to take over. Nature started to reclaim the park, with all of the attractions still intact, but in disrepair. 'Graffiti artists also claimed some of the walls - one hall was used as an impromptu skate-park.' History: The park is believed to have closed after a boy lost his arm on a ride . Halted: Despite the park been closed for many years, many rides are still set up . Fancy a go on this? The park has been left in a severe state of decay . Kris said the amusement park had deteriorated so drastically since being shut down it had to be demolished completely. He said: 'Up until a couple of years ago, everything was still there - but at this moment, everything has been levelled. 'Weirdly enough, there were still a few people there when I took a look around. 'While it sometimes is completely locked down, the gates were wide open when I arrived. Passage through: Most of the rides have now been covered by overgrown trees and bushes . Is it art? The abandoned amusement park has been taken over by graffiti .

"A monkey who's starred in 25 movies over two decades was top dog at the sixth annual Pawscars, the animal version of the Oscars. Waving a statue over her head in triumph, a beaming Crystal accepts the Lifetime Diva Achievement Award looking every bit the part in a pink, floor-length gown and necklace during the show streaming online Wednesday. The Capuchin monkey, who played a Ben Stiller-slapping, key-stealing primate in' Night at the Museum' and a drug-dealing monkey in 'Hangover Part II,' is 'the Angelina Jolie of animal stars,' said NCIS actress Pauley Perrette, who hosted the show with teen actor Lou Wegner. Born to win: A monkey who's starred in 25 movies over two decades was top dog at the sixth annual Pawscars, the animal version of the Oscars . All smiles: Waving a statue  in triumph, a beaming Crystal accepts the Lifetime Diva Achievement Award . Dressed to impress: The animal looked every bit the part in a pink, floor-length gown and necklace during the show streaming online Wednesday . Holding her tiny hand, Perrette asks the prolific primate: 'So Crystal, you have starred with some of the top leading men of all times - Bradley Cooper, Ben Stiller, Matt Damon, Robin Williams - did you have a favorite?' Crystal nods and chitters as her 'answer' appears on screen: 'Robin did call me his favorite leading lady, but my favorite leading man has to be my trainer Tom Gunderson.' The show airs four days before the Academy Awards and honors other animal actors in categories such as best puppy under pressure and best supporting equine. As pets become more important parts of everyday life, including on film and TV, animal award shows have grown in popularity. Pets already took the limelight at the World Dog Awards, the Puppy Bowl and Kitten Bowl on Super Bowl Sunday, and the Westminster dog show. Getting into character: Crystal played a drug-dealing monkey in Hangover Part II (pictured above) Loyal companion: Despite being surrounded by Hollywood hotties, she says her favorite leading man has to be her trainer Tom Gunderson . Strike a pose: The monkey also played a Ben Stiller-slapping, key-stealing primate in Night at the Museum . Movie veteran: Crystal first appeared in the 1997 film George of the Jungle and has appeared in dozens of films since (above, seen in Night At The Museum: Secret Of The Tomb) Like the Oscars, the Pawscars wrap up awards season but are far more low-key. The hosts announce the awards from armchairs in Perrette's Hollywood guest house, while Crystal perches on a nearby ottoman. Other winners are sent an official Pawscars certificate and special treat. Praise for animals on set doesn't come without detractors: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals says live animals don't belong in film and TV work. The American Humane Association, the group hosting the Pawscars, has a 75-year-old program that ensures the safety of animal actors and gives its approval by allowing the familiar 'No Animal Was Harmed' tagline to roll in movie credits. BEST YOUNG ANIMAL PERFORMER . A trio of pit bull puppies won for their work in the late James Gandolfini's last film, The Drop. It took T, Puppers, Ice and a makeup artist to bring to life Rocco, a dog that appears in the mob drama. Puppies grow so fast that the film needed three and non-toxic makeup to make them match. BEST SUPPORTING EQUINE . The award goes to Dale, a horse in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes who carries the apes' leader. It looks like the apes ride bareback, thanks to special-effects markers on the saddles that are removed in post-production, Perrette said. In scenes where the horses appear to be jumping over fire, they are actually jumping over a foot-high bar with flickering lights. BEST AQUATIC PERFORMANCE . The honor goes to Savannah, who plays a dolphin that dies in Dolphin Tale 2, but she avoided having to learn a death scene thanks to animatronics. As for the other marine life, the American Humane Association made sure no animal worked more than an hour without a break. BEST ENSEMBLE . The animals of Wild prevail: Muffet the horse, Dharma the fox, Fred the rattlesnake, Tess the dog, Sport the rabbit and Taiga the llama. In the film about a woman's solo hike along the Pacific Crest Trail, 40 frogs cover a sleeping Reese Witherspoon, but a foot-high barrier surrounding her meant no single frog was lost, Wegner said.","The monkey has starred in 25 movies over two decades .

"Andy Vernon has hit back at Great Britain team-mate Mo Farah for labelling him 'an embarrassment' during their Twitter spat, insisting the double Olympic champion is 'very naive'. The pair came to blows on the social networking site on Tuesday when Vernon questioned the quality of the field that Farah will come up against at this weekend Sainsbury’s Indoor Grand Prix in Birmingham. He tweeted: 'Another stellar field against Mo Farah on home turf this weekend at Birmingham.' #joke.’ Mo Farah celebrates beating Andy Vernon (left) in the Men's 10,000m at the European Championships . The conversation quickly escalated as the two middle-distance runners aired their views on Twitter . Vernon and Farah hold up the Union Jack flag at the European Championships . Farah was from happy with Vernon's remarks, labelling the long-distance runner embarrassing while making a personal jibe at his expense - that singer Taylor Swift could probably run faster than he could. 'Shame you didn’t make the line up...again #ComeBackWhenYouWinSomethingDecent’, said Farah. He added: 'That’s why they didn’t put you in the race mate.. Cos you’re an embarrassment!! Taylor swift can probably run faster than you!’ When speaking to the Portsmouth News Vernon gave his thoughts on the spat saying: 'He called me an embarrassment, but I find what he wrote is very naive.

"The human body is being recreated in miniature by growing tiny working organs on a series of plastic chips connected to each other. Scientists, funded by the US Department of Defense and National Institutes of Health, are hoping to create a 'body on a chip' to mimic the way the human body works. They have already been able to grow fingertip sized lungs, guts and livers on the chips. Scroll down for video . Scientists at Harvard University's Wyss Institute are developing a gut on a chip like the one pictured above . They claim the technology can be used to help test new medical treatments and countermeasures for chemical weapons. A computer memory stick-sized chip is created from a flexible polymer so that it has microscopic channels. The techniques used to make them are the same as those used to create microchips. A porous flexible membrane is placed inside one of the channels and human cells from the airways are grown on top of it. On the opposite side cells from a human capillary blood vessel are grown. Nutrient rich fluid like human blood that can carry away oxygen is flowed down the channel on the same side as the blood vessel cells. The airway cells are left exposed to the air. This mimics the way the lungs work by allowing oxygen from the air to pass through the membrane lining the lungs where it is carried away by red blood cells in the capillaries. The whole structure can also stretch and relax just as the human lungs do when we breath. One group, based at Harvard University's Wyss Institute in Boston, is adapting 'bone marrow on a chip' to study the effects of radiation, for example. It is hoped that all of these organs can be connected together to mimic real biological systems or even the entire human body. These chip based organisms have been nicknamed 'Homo chippiens' by some working in the field. One project supported by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) is aiming to link ten or more organs together. According to Dapra this could be used to study to develop countermeasures against biological and chemical attacks, along with new drugs and vaccines. It said: 'The resulting platform should increase the quality and potentially the number of novel therapies that move through the pipeline and into clinical care.' Another project funded by the National Centre for Advancing Translational Sciences in the US is also aiming to join four organ chips together. The three dimensional tissues are grown in layers inside plastic chips that are about the size of a computer memory stick. Each chip contains tiny channels that mimic the structure of the organ and are lined with human cells. Nutrients are supplied by blood that flows along the channels. Researchers at Harvard University have been able to create kidneys, gut, bone marrow and lungs on a chip using the technique. The lung on a chip, pictured above, attempts to mimic the chemistry and mechanical function of the organ . Darpa wants to combine organs grown on chips to produce a 'body on a chip', as shown in the graphic above . Dr Donald Ingber, a bioengineer at Harvard University's Wyss Institute who has been leading much of the work, said the idea was to mimic the chemical and mechanical function of the organs. He said: 'This is the idea of replacing animal studies for drug testing with little microengineered devices that are lined with human cells and reconstitute organ level functions.' By combining many of these together it could then become possible to study how organs work alongside one another to ensure that a drug that targets one organ does not harm another. He said: 'We could link the heart that beats to the lung that breathes.' The graphic above shows how lung cells are grown on a porous membrane with blood vessel cells grown underneath. Fluid like human blood is then flowed along one side of the channel and air along the other . Speaking to the journal Nature, he said that his team were also adapting their bone marrow on a chip to study radiation exposure. He added: 'It’s unethical to expose humans to the kind of radiation that you’d see in a disaster like Fukushima, but you need to be prepared.' The US Department of Defense has been keen to support this work as a way of verifying that its stockpiles of countermeasures against biological and chemical warfare agents do actually work. Many of them have not been tested in humans due to the ethical problems with exposing them to these deadly weapons. Microbiologist Joshua Powell, from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Washington, told a recent meeting of the American Society for Microbiology that he has been conducing tests using anthrax on rabbit lung cells grown on a chip. According to Nature he said the US Department of Homeland Security want to use similar body on a chip technology to study anthrax in the human body. Next month the US Environmental Protection Agency is expected to announce plans for an $18-million programme to link ‘livers on chips’ with chips that simulate fetal membranes, mammary glands and developing limbs. The aim is to study how environmental contaminants such as dioxin and bisphenol A alter metabolism in those organs once they have been processed by the liver.","Scientists hope to connect organ chips together to mimic a human body .

"Denmark's Prime Minister today joined mourners at the funeral of Copenhagen shooting victim Dan Uzan as hundreds gathered to pay their respects to the slain security guard. Both prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt and the country's justice minister Mette Frederiksen attended the funeral, held at a Jewish cemetery in Copenhagen. Mourners entered and exited the ceremony under the watch of a heavy police presence, with snipers and sniffer dogs deployed throughout the area. Scroll down for video . Danish prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt wipes away tears during the funeral of Dan Uzan . She was one of hundreds to attend the ceremony after Mr Uzan was shot dead in the Copenhagen attack on Sunday . Mrs Thorning-Schmidt pictured on arrival at the funeral, which was held at a Jewish cemetery in Copenhagen . Mr Uzan was killed by gunman Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein, 22, while guarding a synagogue nine hours after El-Hussein had shot dead a Danish filmmaker across town. Soon afterwards, he was killed in a firefight with police which concluded a shooting spree that authorities say may have been inspired by the terror attacks in Paris last month. In the first attack, El-Hussein killed a Danish filmmaker outside the building hosting the free speech seminar Saturday with a single shot from a M95 assault rifle, police spokesman Joergen Skov said. El-Hussein then sprayed the entrance with 27 bullets, wounding three police officers inside. That type of weapon was used by the Danish military between 1995 and 2010, said Rene Gyldensten, a spokesman for the Danish Defence Acquisition and Logistics Organization. It is also used by other NATO forces. 'It could be one of our weapons,' Gyldensten said, adding that police had not yet asked the Defense Ministry to check serial number records. It was unclear how El-Hussein obtained the weapon, which cannot be purchased legally in Denmark. Investigators said police returned fire, including Swedish officers who were in Copenhagen as bodyguards for Lars Vilks, a Swedish artist who has received numerous death threats for caricaturing the Prophet Muhammad and who may have been the main target of the attack. Police teams were put on high alert for the funeral. Pictured are snipers watching over the proceedings from a nearby rooftop .

Two deaths: Finn Norgaard, 55, (left) was killed at a free speech debate in a cafe hours before 37-year-old Dan Uzan (right), a basketball player, was shot in the head as he guarded the door of a Bar Mitzvah . It was unclear whether they missed or whether the gunman was wearing a bullet-proof vest that stopped their bullets. After fleeing the scene, El-Hussein appeared nine hours later outside a synagogue in Copenhagen where he fired nine rounds with two hand guns, killing a Jewish security guard and wounding two police officers. Skov says El-Hussein carried the two handguns when he was shot by a SWAT team early Sunday. A Denmark native with Palestinian parents, El-Hussein had been in and out of prison for violence and weapons offenses and had recently served time for a stabbing on a commuter train, court documents show. The Danish Security and Intelligence Service, known by its Danish acronym PET, acknowledged Tuesday that El-Hussein was flagged in September under a program meant to alert PET to 'inmates who are at risk of radicalization.' What prompted prison authorities to sound the alarm is unclear, but PET said that the information gave the agency 'no reason to believe' that he was plotting attacks. El-Hussein's family have asked for him to be buried in a Muslim cemetery in a Copenhagen suburb but police have not yet released his body, said Kasem Said Ahmad of the Danish Islamic Funeral Foundation.","PM Helle Thorning-Schmidt today attended the funeral for shooting victim .

"His family have claimed an estimated £342,000 in benefits over the last 18 years. But a jobless father who once tipped the scales at 26 stone has turned down jobs that recruitment consultants said he would be able to do. Philip Chawner, 56, who has been a full-time carer for his obese wife for the last 23 years, rejected posts offered to him in a television interview. Scroll down for video of Mr Chawner turning down work . Can't work: Philip Chawner turns down work offered to him by a recruitment consultant because of arthritis and a problem with his legs . Job offers: Recruitment consultant Christopher Lord offers work to Mr Chawner - but he says he can't do it . Mr Chawner, his wife Audrey and their two daughters once weighed a combined 83 stone and were dubbed 'the telly tubbies' by their neighbours in Blackburn, Lancashire. Their daughter Emma, 23, famously appeared on the X-Factor six years ago wearing a wedding-style dress made by her dad. She was kicked off after the first . audition, but not before the family were evicted from their previous . house after neighbours complained about her singing at 3am. Lorraine Kelly tried to get the whole family to slim down in a six-part television series called 'The Chawner Challenge' on the Biography channel. Mr Chawner, a registered carer who was once a lorry driver, said he has lost seven stone and the weight is still falling off - but he is still unable to work because of his medical problems.

Can't work: Philip Chawner and his wife Aubrey said they were unable to work because of their medical conditions . When jobs were offered to him by a local recruitment consultant on ITV's Daybreak, he insisted arthritis and a problem with his legs prevented him from doing physical labour. His daughters Sam and Emma did at least eventually land regular work last year. Recruitment consultant Christopher Lord told him: 'We have got a couple of agencies we would like to run past you. First one is a sprinter van driver with dry pet food products. Is that something that you would be able to do?'

But he replied: 'There would be a problem with lifting the bags, I've got problems with arthritis in my shoulder.' Mr Lord then offered him a second post. 'This is a film packing role - you would be on your feet for eight hours a day,' the recruiter said. Mr Chawner replied: 'Yes. I can't really stand on my feet very well because I have got this heat thing in my legs.' Pressed on whether he could in fact manage the work, he again insisted his shoulder was a problem. Mr Lord told Daybreak he believed the father-of-two was able to do some light work if he wanted to. 'We would be able to put him into a few roles fulfillment packing roles with light duties. I would say he would be able to carry those out. Whether he wants to I don't know.' Mr Chawner said he has been a 24-hour carer for his wife Audrey, 61, since 1990 because she suffers from a series of health problems including epilepsy. Former Apprentice contestant Katie Hopkins attacked Mr and Mrs Chawner and said it wasn't right that taxpayers were paying for them to sit at home. She told them: 'I have no sympathy at all for your . situation. I think if you are obese or morbidly obese the . situation lies in your own hands. 'I think as a taxpayer, speaking for . other taxpayers out there I can't understand for one moment why we are . paying people £17,000 or £18,000 on average to stay at home, that doesn't seem . right to me.' She added that the family's situation will not sit well with people who go out of work to pay and pay taxes to fund their benefits. 'People are getting up at 6am to go to work they are getting home very late. They are missing putting their children to bed and they are missing the things they would like to do,' she added. 'What they are seeing in return is you are sitting on a sofa all day not going out to work but being supported by their taxes.'

"Flown to a new life? Russia's official state newspaper claims disgraced Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych (pictured) has been smuggled out of the country by the CIA . Russia today claimed that the CIA could be behind the disappearance of toppled Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. The official newspaper of Vladimir Putin's government alleged that American intelligence may have secretly flown the disgraced tyrant - now accused of mass murder - to a new life after giving him personal guarantees if he left the political stage. The extraordinary claim in Rossiyskaya Gazeta will inevitably be seen as a smokescreen for similar suspicions that Russia is now shielding former ally Yanukovych, possibly at the headquarters of the Black Sea fleet in Crimea. But today's theory from Moscow's official newspaper that the CIA may be behind his disappearance is the most intriguing yet in a 'Where's Viktor?' hunt that has gripped governments and the media since the weekend revolution in Kiev. 'Where is Viktor Yanukovych?' asked an article on the website of Russia's state-owned newspaper of record. 'The intelligence agencies of many countries, hundreds of politicians and experts, thousands of interested persons in Kiev, and millions of Ukrainians racked their brains over this question. 'He could not have simply disappeared into thin air. He is a recognisable politician, after all, even a very recognisable one. 'And at this point, the entirely logical question comes to mind: Has he not been hidden by people who are very adept at covering tracks? That is to say, by the Americans.' The article stated that 'many people thought it strange how easily Yanukovych raised the white flag and signed an agreement that obviously no-one apart from himself intended to fulfil' after the involvement of the foreign ministers of Germany, Poland and France. The Kremlin newspaper claimed that 'it was obvious that the main 'guarantors' of this document were not European diplomats, but their counterparts from across the Atlantic. 'Yanukovych would definitely have continued to resist if he had not received sufficiently weighty guarantees of safety for himself, his family, and his innermost circle,' stated the Russian version. Making ties: Former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko (who is no longer using the wheelchair she was in when she left prison) shakes hands with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State William Burns in Kiev . Documents recovered from Yanukovych's presidential home that reportedly show evidence of widespread corruption have started to appear online. Journalists and volunteers have been analysing the papers after divers retrieved them from the lake at the sprawling estate in Mezhyirya. They say the documents show how millions was lavished on construction, furnitures and animals. Lesya Ivanova, one of the journalists, told Euro News: 'Some documents were collected from the surface of the water, others were retrieved by the divers.... we had to unfold and dry them immediately to preserve the information.' The papers are being uploaded to the purpose-built website Yanukovychleaks.org. Journalist Oleksandr Akymenko said: 'These documents are very valuable. They could help prove corruption schemes used by Viktor Yanukovych personally, his team and his inner circle.' 'Who could give such guarantees in the . prevailing situation in Ukraine? Only Washington, which, as the latest . events in Kiev show, is the 'eminence grise' behind the Maidan . (Ukrainian protests).' It has been claimed by participants in the talks that Yanukovych abruptly agreed to the agreement last week after consulting various people privately on the phone, including Putin. Yanukovych packed his bags the same night in his vast mansion near Kiev, evidently not intending to return. The paper claimed that the US may have learned from other revolutions where the bloody fate of the toppled tyrant became a spectacle. 'It is possible to understand the Americans. They needed not Yanukovych, but Ukraine. 'At the same time, Washington is clearly not interested in a repetition of the bloody reprisal against Libyan leader Mu'ammar al-Qadhafi in a European state. 'In other words, the State Department . could have given Yanukovych any safety guarantees, so long as he . disappeared from the Ukrainian political stage. 'And the Americans are past masters at disappearing people. Take the episode of the CIA's flying prisons alone.' The . newspaper also denied reports that the Russians which have major . military facilities in Sevastopol - close to the last alleged sighting . of on-the-run Yanukovych in Balaclava - was now in Moscow's hands. 'Yanukovych . is not in the facilities or ships of the Russian Black Sea Fleet,' stated Rossiyskaya Gazeta citing an 'informed military source'.

'Information appeared to the effect that Yanukovych was in Kharkiv. But he was not found there either. 'Perhaps . he has fled in the direction of the Persian Gulf?

Ukrainians have poured in by their thousands onto the 140-hectare grounds for a first glimpse at a luxury . 'According to unconfirmed information, . the Ukrainian president has even given up his personal state guard. There is no doubt that, if this is true, it is far easier to disappear . without a guard than with one. 'So just where is Yanukovych? In Kiev, he has even been placed on the wanted list. 'It . cannot be ruled out, however, that the thugs who have seized power in . the Ukrainian capital simply need to inquire about the whereabouts of . the disappeared president from the US ambassador, who is becoming an . ever more important figure on the political Olympus of ""independent"" Ukraine.

"From a curved design to faster processors, Samsung has been teasing upcoming features of its next Galaxy phone for weeks. And now the Korean firm has heavily implied the device - or multiple new devices - will come with wireless charging built-in.

The use of the plural 'smartphones' adds further weight to the fact Samsung will unveil at least two handsets at this year's Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in March. Previous leaks said the Galaxy S6 will feature a Quad HD 5.5-inch display. Other reports claim the screen will measure a smaller 5.1 inches. It is expected to have an octa-core processor and 16MP rear-facing camera. More recent rumours suggest the firm will also unveil an Edge version of its flagship phone. The S6 Edge is said to have a curved screen that covers both sides. The Korean giant believes its curved technology could give it an edge over arch rival Apple.

The use of the plural  'smartphones' in Samsung's latest blog post adds weight to these claims. Elsewhere, this post heavily implies the devices will have wireless charging built in. Both handsets are expected to be unveiled at Mobile World Congress on 1 March. These are expected to be the Samsung Galaxy S6, and the S6 Edge that is rumoured to have a curved screen that covers both sides.

Until now, many phones and other products have predominantly used the 'magnetic-inductive' method of charging. This involves pairing a device with a dock and is used from phones to electric toothbrushes and shavers. There are three wireless charging organisations including the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC), and its Qi standard, the Power Matters Alliance (PMA) and the Alliance for Wireless Power (A4WP). Samsung is a member of all three groups. This means that manufacturers have to choose which standard they use, and not every standard is supported across different charging points, for example. However, last year, components that support multiple standards on a single chip were released and in January, the PMA and A4WP announced they would join forces to offer better wireless charging features.

Samsung surprised audiences at the Berlin-based trade show IFA in September when it unveiled its original curved device. The screen was described by Samsung's David Park at the event as working like a 'ticker', with notifications and news scrolling along it. The Galaxy Note Edge's unique curved touchscreen provides quick access to frequently used apps and alerts. The curved screen displays notifications at the top and bottom, while viewing a video without disruption, for example. Earlier this month, in the face of stiff competition, and following a consecutive drop in profits, Samsung announced plans to curb the number of phones it makes each year. Instead of releasing handset after handset and saturating the market with Samsung devices, the firm has decided it needs to concentrate on making fewer handsets, better. The South Korean manufacturer is also expected to ramp up production of its remaining models so they can be sold more cheaply. The strategy was unveiled during a presentation in New York by Samsung's head of investor relations, Robert Yi. He said the company would reduce the number of smartphone models in 2015 by between a quarter and a third. The S6 won't be the first phone to have wireless charging built in - the Nokia Lumia 920 (pictured) already offers this feature. But the 920 runs on just one of the three standards.

'The mid-to-low end market is growing rapidly, and we plan to respond actively in order to capitalise on that growth,' said Samsung Senior Vice President Kim Hyun-joon during a conference call with analysts. In a rare acknowledgement, Mr Yi added that Samsung had lagged behind changing market conditions.

"Roy Keane was back on our screens on Tuesday night, delivering the kind of frank appraisals he won admiration for during his initial stint as an ITV pundit. His straight-forward assessments were that: this current Chelsea side cannot be considered great until they win trophies; John Terry should have been on the front foot for Edinson Cavani’s goal; and Jose Mourinho’s defenders struggled to deal with simple crosses from Paris Saint-Germain all evening. No spectacular insight, and hardly cause to cower behind the sofa, but it is clear his natural demand for excellence remains an underlying constant, two and a half months after his sudden departure from Aston Villa. Tim Sherwood, whose tongue can deliver similar sharp critique, might decide that chapter worth studying as he plans his own manual for guiding Villa to safety. Roy Keane (left) pictured at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday night alongside fellow pundit Paul Scholes . Tim Sherwood gestures during an Aston Villa training session at Bodymoor Heath on Tuesday . Keane left Villa after clashes with senior players, mainly over training intensity and his high standards towards performance. While some in the squad liked his style, his words overall carried too much venom to prove successful. Ills cannot always be cured by a deluge of bitter medicine. Sometimes the pills must be palatable. Premier League professionals should be capable of engaging in robust discussions on football matters, and any Villa player who feels beyond criticism this season needs to take one look at the table. But when a group is low on confidence a mix of tactics might require employment. This is the subtlety of management. It is why Sir Alex Ferguson occasionally switched off his hairdryer. It is in this context that it is worth visiting Sherwood’s answer from his Monday press conference to a question about his honesty in regards to player appraisals. Sherwood looks on as he takes his first training session since becoming the new Villa manager . Roy Keane suddenly quit as Aston Villa assistant manager at the end of November . ‘One thing I can guarantee if I'm going to be guilty of something it will be honesty,’ he readily agreed before adding a caveat. ‘If they do well they will be told, if they don't do well they will also be told and told why. You have to be constructive. ‘It can't be because of a referee's decision or if someone scores a 40-yarder that everyone's c***. That ain’t the case. ‘You have to talk to them. Some people might have played well and need to be patted on the back. Some people need a kick up the backside at the right time and I need to be that person to be able to do that.’ Sherwood famously called out his Spurs players for lacking guts and character after a 4-0 defeat to Chelsea, a public dressing down viewed in quarters as too far. ‘Watch this space!’ he grinned when asked if he would use similar language at Villa. You hope, for his and the club’s sake, he does not need to go there. A deeper guide of his mentality presented itself when probed about the merits of all players in his squad. He voluntarily brought up his relationship with Brazilian midfielder Sandro, who saw his game time limited following that humbling at Stamford Bridge. Discordant, is one way to describe their dynamic. Villa boss Sherwood shouts instructions during training in Birmingham on Tuesday . Sherwood speaks to his players during his first training session at Bodymoor Heath . ‘Everyone has got an important part to play,’ said Sherwood of Villa. ‘There won’t be anyone who is not included in my plans. It’s a fresh start for everyone. ‘Whether the previous manager liked them or he didn’t, it doesn’t matter to me. They need to prove themselves on the training field. I need to see them train well and see what they produce. 'It’s a jigsaw you put together when you pick a team and you look at the opposition. You have to leave out a lot of players doing that but that doesn’t mean they’re finished. You might leave them out for two weeks and they start getting a bit disgruntled but it doesn’t mean they’re finished. ‘You can bring them back because there might be that time at the end of the season when they need to come back in and do a job. Sandro was a good example of that at Spurs against Aston Villa, the last game of last season. Everyone down south was talking about how I had a big fall out with him. Sherwood poses for the cameras as he is unveiled as the new Aston Villa manager on Monday . Sherwood is in good spirits as he speaks to journalists during a press conference on Monday . ‘I never burnt any bridges with any players. Never. There was always a chance that I would bring him back and put him in the team and I brought him back for that game because I was worried about the counter attacking threat of (Gabby) Agbonlahor. ‘I pushed the full backs on and played Sandro in the pivot role and he did the job for me and got a standing ovation coming off after 60 minutes. ‘You don’t burn bridges with players. You can’t afford to do that. They’re paid a lot of money by the football club and it’s an asset you’re pouring down the drain.’ Sherwood spent Monday evening watching Villa’s Under-21 side lose 3-0 to Derby at the Pirelli Stadium. Jack Grealish, Charles N’Zogbia and Matt Lowton were among those featuring in a disjointed performance that suggested individual efforts were being made to impress the new boss. Scott Sinclair celebrates after scoring for Aston Villa in their FA Cup victory against Leicester City . Sherwood (centre) celebrates after watching Sinclair score for Villa in the FA Cup fifth-round match . As an exercise in assessing his assets, Sherwood may have left underwhelmed. From this point he needs to work out how much he should ruffle feathers, how often to offer a coaxing pat. Whatever his call, whether burning bridges or building bridges, the only bridge of concern to Villa is the one connecting them to Premier League football for the 2015-16 season. On that basis, Keane provides an interesting signpost.","Roy Keane was on ITV on Tuesday delivering his typical frank appraisals .

"Prince Harry is facing fresh embarrassment as it has been revealed his nude romp in Vegas may have been caught on video. Pictures of a naked Harry covering his genitals and hugging a nude woman while playing strip billiards in a Vegas hotel room emerged last week. Harry, along with the Duke and . Duchess of Cambridge, is an ambassador for the Team GB Paralympics . squad. Scroll down for video . Before the party: Prince Harry was snapped in Las Vegas admiring a tall blonde, who has been named as 27-year-old Danielle Davidson, before hosting a private party in his hotel room . He is scheduled to attend a number of the elite disabled sport . events over the coming weeks before returning to his job as an Army . helicopter pilot. In . his first public appearance since the Las Vegas incident, the prince . will watch swimmers in the aquatics centre on Monday and later that day . chat to sportsmen and women in the official meeting place for the . country’s competitors - ParalympicsGB House. Any video footage of the Prince's antics is bound to heap yet more embarrassment on the Royal family. 'There is video of Harry partying . naked with women in the Las Vegas hotel room,' a source familiar with . the situation told RadarOnline. 'There have been some very quiet inquiries to see . how much the video is worth. If the video goes public this could . be the biggest Royal scandal ever.' Only one British newspaper published the naked photographs of the Prince after the Palace issued a warning to the press. However, the snaps were beamed online around the world. At the time an anonymous source claimed the pictures were just the tip of the iceberg on celebrity blogger Norm Clark's Las Vegas gossip page. More to see? It has now emerged that the Prince's Vegas romp in which he was photographed playing strip billiards may also have been captured on video . They suggested 'something pretty gigantic' happened during the private party, adding it was 'something more . serious than strip billiards'. Radar's source added: 'The video has not been shopped around . yet, its existence is being kept as discreet as possible. They added: 'A lot went on in that . hotel room that night, that much is for sure. With all the attention the photos got, the people with the . video know it could be worth a fortune.' The website reported it had not . seen the video and it was not known whether the alleged footage was shot . by the same person who took the initial pictures. A spokesman from Clarence House told MailOnline they had 'no comment' on the story. The claim is the latest in a string of revelations to potentially tarnish the third-in-line-to-the-Throne's Royal image. After the nude photos of the Prince emerged last week Harry removed himself from Facebook, . where he operated under the pseudonym Spike Wells. Boys about town: Tom 'Skippy' Inskip, Prince Harry and the Prince's Protection Officer relax in a hot tub in Las Vegas. But is there more to come? Following advice from his private secretary, . Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, who is heading an inquiry into the Prince’s . trip to Las Vegas, Harry deleted his account. The Mail on Sunday was told that . the Prince’s two best friends, Tom ‘Skippy’ Inskip, 25, who joined him . in Vegas, and Arthur Landon, 30, have also closed their Facebook . accounts, as has one of his key Scotland Yard minders. Fully clothed: The claim is the latest in a string of revelations to potentially tarnish the third-in-line-to-the-Throne's Royal image . The Prince was said to be ‘terrified’ further damaging images might emerge and his concerns intensified after . photos of an ‘even wilder’ week in the British Virgin Islands on Sir . Richard Branson’s private island of Necker, shortly before the Vegas . weekend, were leaked to a newspaper. Pictures from the trip were originally posted on Facebook by one of Harry's friends. Harry, Inskip and rugby player Adam . Bidwell, 36, were among his entourage who checked into a £5,100-a-night . suite on the 63rd floor of one of the city’s most elite resorts. 'The . suite is in a tower that has its own private casino,' said a maid. 'It . has mohair walls to absorb the sound, a pool and a wet bar.' They . ate and drank at the hotel's most exclusive bars and restaurants, . including the most expensive restaurant, the SW Steakhouse, . named after the complex’s owner Steve Wynn, who reportedly picked up the . £50,000 bill for their visit. The rowdy group then moved on to one of . the hotel’s nightclubs, Surrender, where they were ushered into the . red-curtained VIP area. They . are . understood to have picked up two girls at the club for the party where . the naked Prince was captured on fuzzy mobile phone shots and sold for . £10,000 . to the TMZ website. At . 1.30pm the next day, just seven-and-a-half hours after the now infamous . 'strip billiard' game, Harry is believed to have hosted a second vodka-fuelled  pool party with a dozen ‘randomly recruited’ girls. ‘Girls were . invited to come over and meet Harry,’ according to a source. Scotland Yard minders looked on as the girls were ushered inside the private villa – or cabana – at the MGM Grand . Hotel’s Wet Republic club, according to the source. The party went on for five-and-half-hours. ‘What . is incredible is that his detectives didn’t request any special . security at Wet Republic,’ said the source. ‘They had no requirements . whatsoever. Scores of saucy soldiers' wives are stripping off and saluting to show support for Prince Harry, posting pictures of their poses on Facebook. Here Lynne Haywood gets in on the act... There have been 3,600 complaints to the press watchdog about naked photographs of Prince Harry published in the Sun. The tabloid became the first British newspaper to carry the pictures on Friday, arguing that the move was in the public interest and a ‘crucial’ test of the country’s free press. The Press Complaints Commission (PCC) said the complaints all came from members of the public, with none from St James’s Palace or any other representatives of the royal family. The pictures of Harry frolicking in the nude with an unnamed woman while on holiday in Las Vegas made headlines around the world but St James’s Palace asked UK papers, via the PCC, to respect Harry’s privacy. Sun managing editor David Dinsmore said the paper had ‘thought long and hard’ about whether to use the pictures and said it was an issue of freedom of the press rather than because it was moralising about Harry’s actions. He told the BBC’s Radio 5 Live The Sun did generally ‘fear’ the PCC, but a decision had been made to publish the photos because of the public interest. The decision provoked a mixed reaction both in and outside the media industry. Former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott said the newspaper had shown ‘absolute utter contempt’ for the law and the Leveson Inquiry. ‘It is not about privacy. It is about money, money, money. And they know that by exclusively printing the pictures, assuming they are the only (British) paper which does, they will get everybody buying the paper to see this.’ In a Twitter exchange with Lord Prescott, Rupert Murdoch denied taking the decision to print the photographs. ‘Decision was rightly that of the editor, and I support [it]. I was in Silicon Valley far removed,’ he wrote. Posting again later, Mr Murdoch wrote: ‘Simple equation: free, open uncontrollable internet versus shackled newspapers equals no newspapers. Let’s get real.’ London Mayor Boris Johnson said he had a ‘deafening indifference’ to the publication of the naked photos. He told the BBC: ‘The real scandal would be if you went all the way to Las Vegas and you didn’t misbehave in some trivial way.’","It is thought owner of alleged video has been making inquiries to see .

"Many people travel thousands of miles and sit in the freezing cold of the Nordic to see the Northern Lights. But residents of Cumbria and North Yorkshire were treated to the dazzling light show last night as the aurora borealis was spotted on the north eastern coast of the UK. One photographer managed to capture the breathtaking views by Dunstanburgh Castle, on the Northumberland coast and the display was described as the 'best in years.' Photographer Owen Humphreys from Whitley Bay, North Tyneside, travelled to Dunstanburgh Castle, on the Northumberland coast to capture this image of Northern Lights. He said the thrilling show lasted for several hours, as light travelled across the 'dark and moonless night' Owen Humphreys from Whitley Bay, North Tyneside, travelled to the castle with relative 16-year-old Matthew O'Connor, who is studying for a GCSE in photography. He said the thrilling show lasted for several hours, as pillars of light 'danced across the dark and moonless night'. There are two types of Aurora - Aurora Borealis, which means ‘dawn of the north’, and Aurora Australis, ‘dawn of the south.’ They . are caused when electrically charged particles from the sun enter . the Earth’s atmosphere. These so-called geomagnetic storms occur when a . solar wind or cloud of magnetic field hits the Earth’s magnetic field. Usually . the charged particles from the sun are deflected by the Earth’s . magnetic field, but some do manage to enter the atmosphere and collide . with gas particles. These collisions emit light. Auroral . displays appear in many colours although pale green and pink are common. 'We knew there was a 20 per cent chance of seeing the aurora but we went up to take pictures of the Milky Way', explained the 42-year-old. 'When it started it came out of the blue and instead of staying for three or four hours we were there for about seven. 'There was a small show around 10pm, then it got stronger after midnight and at 2am it went crazy. 'There were a lot of greens and some pink colours in the sky. There were swirling and dancing pillars of light going 100ft (30 metres) in the air. 'It was unreal and the best show I have seen for years.' That sentiment was shared by Kielder Observatory, which tweeted 'we had the best aurora display in years'. There are two types of Aurora - Aurora Borealis, which means ‘dawn of the north’, and Aurora Australis’, known as ‘dawn of the south.’ The natural phenomenon is caused by charged particles colliding in the Earth's atmosphere and is typically seen above the magnetic poles of the northern and southern hemisphere. Nitrogen produces blue or purplish-red aurora. Before a display, electrons and protons are hurled from the sun's atmosphere and are blown towards the Earth by the solar wind. Often these particles are then deflected by the Earth's magnetic field but as it is weaker at either pole, some particles enter the atmosphere and collide with gas particles. These collisions emit light.

Auroral displays appear in many colours although pale green and pink are the most common. Shades of red, blue, and violet have also been reported. The common, greenish-yellow colour is caused by colliding oxygen molecules approximately 60 miles (96km) above Earth. Rare, red auroras are produced by oxygen molecules situated much higher up, at around 200 miles (321km). Matt Robinson, a 29-year-old volunteer at Kielder Observatory, said the solar wind takes three days to reach Earth, so aurora watchers have some notice about when the lights might appear strongly.

Experts said aurora watchers need to head out of the city and away from light pollution which bleaches out the display, as does bright moonlight. An image of the display was also taken over Richmond in North Yorkshire (pictured) He said: 'It's hit and miss and you have to hope everything else works in your favour. 'You need clear skies, the Earth's magnetic field has to be pointing in the right direction... it's complicated but it is worth it when it comes off.' Aurora watchers also need to head out of the city and away from light pollution which bleaches out the display, as does bright moonlight. Mr Robinson added: 'Unless it is a very strong storm, it is quite difficult to see in the city as the lights will drown it out.' Usually the best spots to see the lights are those places close to the North Pole, such as Iceland and Norway. Other photos of the British display were taken over Richmond in North Yorkshire. The Northern Lights over Finland were also recently added to Google Street View so armchair explorers can see the display and explore the remote region online.

"Two major banks are to let their customers access their accounts on their iPhones using Apple's Touch ID fingerprint scanning technology. Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and NatWest said that customers will no longer need to remember complicated login information to see their finances. It is the first time a major bank has enabled the fingerprint recognition technology in place of passwords and passcodes on a mobile phone application. Scroll down for video . Natwest and RBS customers will be able to use their fingerprint to access their accounts on iPhones (above) Around 880,000 RBS and NatWest customers are expected to be able to use the feature, which is only available on iPhone 5S and iPhone 6 devices. Touch ID uses a small touch sensor encased around the home button that scans the layers of skin on a finger. Users can 'train' their iPhone to . read and learn their unique fingerprint and when they touch the home . button, the phone is unlocked. Touch ID can also be replace an App Store password when buying music, apps or books. It uses a 'laser cut sapphire . crystal' to take a high-resolution image scan before the Touch ID software in iOS 7 . detemines whether the print belongs to the owner or not. All fingerprint information is . encrypted and stored securely inside the device's chip. The prints are not stored on an Apple server, or backed up to iCloud. However some experts have warned that as more of our data is protected by the Touch ID . RBS said that it hoped the technology would make it easier and more convenient for customers to access their finances. Stuart Haire, managing director of RBS and NatWest Direct Bank, said: 'There has been a revolution in banking, as more and more of our customers are using digital technology to bank with us. 'Adding Touch ID to our mobile banking app makes it even easier and more convenient for customers to manage their finances on the move.' While the banks are the first to make use of Apple's Touch ID fingerprint scanning technology, they are not the first to use such biometric scanning. Barclay's Bank announced last year that it is to introduce 'finger-vein' readers to allow their customers to get rid of their pin numbers. The scanners take an infra-red scan of the unique vein pattern that lies just below the skin. Barclays said that it was rolling out the devices to its 30,000 corporate customers this year and if successful it would be extended to its other customers. Apple's Touch ID uses a sensor to scan the fingerprint of users that it then matches to one stored in its software. Some iPhone Apps already use Touch ID for making purchases, including Apple's own iTunes store and Amazon's app. RBS and NatWest say 50 per cent of their 15 million customers now use online banking, with three million using their mobile app. The banks estimate that 1.8 million of those use iPhones, on average 40 times per month. However, not all models of the iPhone have Touch ID, with older devices and the iPhone 5C not featuring the hardware. Those with the right technology will have to activate the feature with their usual security information but would then only need to use Apple's Touch ID from then on. It took just two days and a small collection of everyday household items for a group of German hackers to bypass the fingerprint sensor on an Apple iPhone 5S. The group, calling themselves the Chaos Computer Club, took a high-resolution photograph of a fingerprint from the side of a glass using 2400 dpi resolution. The image was then cleaned up using photo-editing software before being inverted. They then laser printed it onto a transparent sheet with 1200 dpi resolution using a thick toner setting. The hackers then poured pink latex milk or white woodglue into the print pattern created by the toner onto the transparent sheet. After . it dried, the thin latex sheet is lifted from the sheet, breathed on . 'to make it a tiny bit moist' and pressed onto the sensor to unlock the . phone. Apple said the Touch ID fingerprint sensor is designed to provide 'accurate readings from any angle . After three failed login attempts with Touch ID, however, customers would have to re-enter their passcodes. Last year RBS said that it would invest £1 billion over the next three years to make it easier for customers to bank when they are on the move. Simon Cadbury, head of strategy and innovation at digital banking consultants Intelligent Environments, said that biometric security like fingerprint scanning had the potential to make banking services safer to use by reducing the risk of phishing attacks and identity fraud. He said: 'The key benefit of biometric security is that they don’t only make services more secure, but also easier to use. 'Our research shows that eight in ten people are ready to ditch their passwords in favour of biometric security measures. 'The popularity of mobile devices like the best-selling iPhone 6 has finally helped move biometric technology into the mainstream. 'This will provide banking customers with the convenience of not having to remember multiple log ins that are entered manually whilst also reducing the potential for phishing attacks and identity fraud.' However, the introduction of Touch ID will raise some concerns among security experts. German hacker Jan Krissler claimed that he had managed to use photographs of German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen's hand to recreate her fingerprints. Others have shown that it is possible to unlock Touch ID secured phones by lifting fingerprints from glass or the device's screen. Ben Schlabs, of SRLabs, a German hacking think tank, told the BBC: 'Just the fact that you are carrying the key around with you and leave copies of it exposed everywhere you go makes it a very different risk to something that is inside your brain. The risks are poorly understood.' Phil Underwood, global head of pre-sales at security experts SecurEnvoy, said: 'There is always a balancing act when it comes to authentication. Make it too easy for the user and the authentication may be compromised or circumvented, too hard and adoption rates for the new authentication technology will drop. 'One of the main drivers of this authentication technology taking hold, is that the current generation’s device of choice is now firmly the smartphone, with there now being over 1.75 billion devices in use worldwide and this is ever growing. 'With the advent of reliable fingerprint readers on the latest smartphones, the second ""something the user knows"" component is switched from a potentially easy-to-break password to a physical one that is unique.'","RBS and NatWest want customers to use fingerprints to access accounts .

"Our solar system had a close encounter with another star 70,000 years ago, new research has revealed. The recently discovered star passed just 0.8 light years away from our own sun and was so close it passed through the icy cloud of outer comets that encircles our solar system. This makes it the closest a star has come to our solar system - five times nearer than Proxima Centauri, our current closest stellar neighbour. Scholz star, shown in the artists impression above as behind its brown dwarf companion in the foreground, passed within 0.8 light years of the Sun (shown as the bright star on the left) around 70,000 years ago . Since that encounter, the star, which is known as Scholz's star, has moved off at high speed and is now thought to be around 20 light years away. Far beyond the orbit of Neptune, trillions of comets left over from the formation of the solar system lie in wait in a region known as the Oort cloud. Here they are kept in relatively stable orbits around the sun, posing little threat to Earth save for the occasional icy rock that ventures inwards. But in the blink of a cosmic eye that could all change, as stars have been found that could pass near our solar system in 240,000 years - and it they might shower us with thousands of deadly comets. According to Dr Coryn Bailer-Jones from the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, there are several stars that could pose a danger to our solar system. As our sun performs its cosmic dance around the Milky Way, it comes closer to and further from other stars in the vicinity. Astronomers discovered the star's flyby by tracing its movement through the sky and found it would have passed within the outer Oort Cloud of comets. Dr Eric Mamajek, an astronomer at the University of Rochester who led the study, said that it is unlikely the star would have caused much disturbance to the scattered icy comets that orbit the outermost reaches of our solar system. However, he said it raised the possiblity that other close encounters with stars in the future could have a far greater impact. He said: 'Using the best available astrometry, our simulations suggest that the probability that the star penetrated the outer Oort Cloud is ∼98%. 'While the flyby of this system likely caused negligible impact on the flux of longperiod comets, the recent discovery of this binary highlights that dynamically important Oort Cloud perturbers may be lurking among nearby stars.' Scholz's star was first discovered in 2014 by Ralf-Dieter Scholz but unlike other stars around it, it appeared to have an unusual motion in the sky. A team of scientists from the US, Europe, Chile and South Africa used observations of its motion to trace back its trajectory. They found that the star is moving away from the Earth at great speed and came alarmingly close 70,000 years ago. The Oort Cloud is a region filled with icy comets around our solar system, as shown in the graphic above . They calculated that the star, which also has the catchy name WISE J072003.20-084651.2, passed five trillion miles away from our sun (0.8 light years away). Proxima Centauri, our closest neighbour, is 4.2 light years away. However, even this close it would have been impossible to see the star from Earth with the naked eye as it is far too dim. The scientists believe it is an active red dwarf star that is about 8 per cent the mass of our own Sun. It is part of a binary star system and is accompanied by a brown dwarf - a failed star that was too small to spark into life. Even when at its closest to Earth, Scholz's star would have been 50 times fainter than what can normally be seen with the naked eye. Instead the star would only have been visible with a telescope - technology far beyond our ancestors 70,000 years ago. However, the star may have occassionally flared and become brighter for a few minutes. For any of our ancestors who glanced upwards during such a flare, they would have seen it in the area around the Big Dipper. The astronomers, whose work is published in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters, calculated that Scholz's star's path would have taken it through the outer areas of the Oort Cloud. The Oort cloud is a vast and mysterious region that is thought to surround our solar system. It contains trillions of comets left over from the birth of the universe - and possibly larger objects like dwarf planets as well. It begins at about 0.08 light-years from the sun - 170 times the orbit of Neptune - and extends out to about 0.8 light-years. Occasionally, comets from the region make their way into the solar system, known as long-period comets. One of the most famous this year was comet Siding Spring, which brushed past Mars on 19 October. However, apart from these brief visitors, not much is known about the Oort cloud. It has never been directly observed, and it is not exactly known how large it is - although it is thought to define the gravitational influence of the sun. The Oort cloud (illustrated) is a vast and mysterious region that is thought to surround our solar system. It contains trillions of comets left over from the birth of the universe - and possibly larger objects like dwarf planets as well. Long-period comets originate here, while short-period comets come from the Kuiper Belt . Large comets in this icy region of space give rise to the comets that enter the innner solar system if their orbits are disturbed. Simulations of the trajectory of Scholz's star showed that while it passed through this area it is unlikely to have triggered a comet shower. Until now, the top candidate for the closest flyby of a star to the solar system was the so-called 'Death Star' HIP 8560, which was predicted to come close to our solar system in 240,000 to 470,000 years from now. However, Mamajek and his collaborators have also demonstrated that the original distance to HIP 85605 was likely underestimated by a factor of ten. At its more likely distance – about 200 light years – HIP 85605’s newly calculated trajectory would not bring it within the Oort Cloud. At its closest, Scholz's star would have been moving across the sky at an 70 arcseconds per year - at this speed it would have moved the distance of the Moon in the sky in 26 years. Dr Mamajek said: 'The small tangential motion and proximity initially indicated that the star was most likely either moving towards a future close encounter with the solar system, or it had ‘recently’ come close to the solar system and was moving away. 'Sure enough, the radial velocity measurements were consistent with it running away from the Sun’s vicinity – and we realized it must have had a close flyby in the past.'","Scholz's star was discovered in 2014 but appeared to have an odd motion .

"Darren Clarke admitted it would be remiss of him not to put his personal differences with Paul McGinley to one side and seek advice from his predecessor after being named Europe's Ryder Cup captain for 2016. The 46-year-old, who played in the biennial contest five times and was a vice-captain in 2010 and 2012, was unanimously chosen ahead of Miguel Angel Jimenez and Thomas Bjorn by a five-man selection panel at Wentworth. 'To be captain of the European Team is a huge honour that ranks up there with anything I've achieved in the professional game. It's right up at the very top,' former Open champion Clarke said. Darren Clarke looks in good spirits after being announced as Europe's captain for the 2016 Ryder Cup . Clarke on the phone moments after being announced as Europe's new Ryder Cup captain . Clarke (right) is given his kit after he was given the nod ahead of Miguel Angle Jimenez and Thomas Bjorn . The selection panel consisted of the three most recent captains - McGinley, Jose Maria Olazabal and Colin Montgomerie - along with European Tour chief executive George O'Grady and players' representative David Howell. McGinley and Clarke's relationship has been severely strained since Clarke put himself forward for the 2014 captaincy, having previously sent McGinley a letter supporting the Dubliner's candidacy. And when Tom Watson was named US captain in December 2012, Clarke suggested Montgomerie should also be considered as 'whoever it is standing on that stage opposite Tom Watson needs a huge presence'. McGinley admitted last year his conversations with Clarke were now 'short and sweet' but Clarke will consult McGinley after the Dubliner's leadership at Gleneagles received widespread acclaim. 'It would be very foolish for me not to follow the same formula,' Clarke said. 'With everything that came out of Gleneagles and the unbelievable job that Paul did there, I would be foolish not to speak to Paul and all the other captains before that. Clarke puts on his new top during the Dimension Data Pro-Am in George, South Africa . (From left to right) Jose Maria Olazabal, David Howell, Paul McGinley, George O'Grady and Colin Montgomerie had a meeting at Wentworth on Wednesday to pick Europe's captain for the 2016 Ryder Cup .

Years played: 1997 (winners), 1999, 2002 (winners), 2004, 2006 (winners) Total matches: 20 . Career record: Won 10 Lost 7 Halved 3 . Total points won: 11.5 . 'The team bonding and spirit they had at Gleneagles is obviously something I would love to replicate. 'I will try to pick off as much information as I can from all the previous captains. I think it would be very remiss of me if I didn't do that to try and pick out the bits that they thought worked best for the teams. 'At the end of the day it's not about me, it's about the players and to try and make sure the team has an enjoyable week, which is quite difficult in a stressful atmosphere that the Ryder Cup is. But if the guys are relaxed and enjoy themselves that always helps a little bit more. 'Certainly with the teams that I have been involved in, both as a player and vice-captain, that has been a huge factor.' McGinley reiterated that he would not act as vice-captain to Clarke, or anyone else, but added: 'I will give him any support he needs. 'At the same time it's important I step away too. 'Darren's now at the front and let him go ahead. It's not necessarily about following me or following Jose or following Monty or anybody who has done it before and won. It's about doing what's best for him and how he sees it.' Clarke said he has a 'few people in mind' for his vice-captains and indicated he was likely to copy McGinley and have five of them at Hazeltine, where he is set to come up against good friend Davis Love. Love is set to be confirmed as United States captain next week and Clarke added: 'If so that would be wonderful. We've played many practice rounds together and are very good friends. He is a gentleman and there isn't a nicer man in our sport.' Clarke was vice-captain at the 2010 Ryder Cup at Celtic Manor in Wales .

The Ryder Cup is pictured at Wentworth on Wednesday as the five-man panel met to choose the captain . Scott Crockett (left), European Tour media communications director, and Ryder Cup director Richard Hills annnounced that Clarke will be Europe's 2016 Ryder Cup captain . Love was captain in 2012 when Europe produced the 'Miracle at Medinah' to recover from 10-4 down on Saturday afternoon and win by a single point. Last year's win at Gleneagles made it three in succession and six of the last seven, something that Montgomerie believes will make Clarke's job all the harder. Montgomerie told Sky Sports News: 'It's an unenviable task; America want it back badly and he will have all our support. They do want revenge, they set up their task force and had their own internal wranglings about what they can do to win it back. 'We have selected a captain that I am convinced will retain the Ryder Cup and bring it home. I think he will be a very good communicator with the players individually, which is most important as a captain. He has the respect of the players.' The last of Clarke's five appearances as a player was an emotionally-charged affair at the K Club in 2006, when he somehow won all three of his matches just weeks after the death of his first wife Heather from cancer. Clarke and long-time friend Lee Westwood played the final fourball match of the first session against Phil Mickelson and Chris Di Marco, with Clarke hitting his opening drive more than 300 yards down the fairway, pitching to 12 feet and then holing for birdie. After failing to qualify for the next two contests, Clarke was a surprise winner of the Open Championship at Royal St George's in 2011, but has failed to record a single top-10 finish on the European Tour since. In contrast, Jimenez and Bjorn have remained competitive, with Bjorn making his third appearance as a player at Gleneagles and 51-year-old Jimenez extending his record as the Tour's oldest winner with victory in the Spanish Open last year.

"Police have found a sizable piece of one of the engines from a plane that crashed into the World Trade Center, more than 11 years after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The piece of landing gear was found wedged between two buildings just blocks from Ground Zero- in between the buildings at 51 Park Place and 50 Murray Street in downtown Manhattan. The location is particularly noteworthy because 51 Park Place is the site of the Islamic Cultural Center that stirred up controversy and months of protests two years ago when the site developers wanted to turn it into a mosque. Scroll down for video . Found: part of a landing gear from one of the 9/11 planes was discovered wedged between buildings with a mysterious rope around it . Close: The debris was found lodged in a tiny alley at 51 Park, mere blocks from Ground Zero . Just before 7pm Friday, New York City Police Commissioner . Raymond Kelly arrived on the scene and was escorted inside the rundown . building, where he put on a  crime scene suit and was led to the site of the . unexpected discovery. In a press conference that took place across the street . about 30 minutes later, Kelly told reporters that Wednesday surveyors . were working in the narrow space when they came across an unidentified . mechanical part. Police received a report about the discovery, but officers . who responded were not sure what the large piece of metal was resting in a very . confined space littered with debris. Kelly then showed reporters a hand-drawn . diagram of the scene made on a small piece of paper. A short time later, the FBI, the National Transportation . Safety Board and the Medical Examiner’s Office were notified. Pilots who were . consulted ruled that the large piece of steel measuring 5 feet by 4 feet by 17 . inches at one time was part of a plane’s landing gear. Mystery: Commissioner Kelly (pictured) told reporters a rope was wrapped around the gear and that aspect of the find would be investigated . Some answers: Officials held a press conference in front of the buildings (pictured) where the gear was found . Kelly said that mechanical part was wedged in narrow space measuring about 18 inches, and according to Kelly, a rope . could be seen intertwined with the steel. Police officers cordoned off the section of Park Place . surrounding the site of the discovery located inside a former Burlington Coat . Factory department store, which was controversially turned into an . Islamic center and mosque just blocks away from the World Trade Center site. NYPD deputy commissioner Paul Browne told CBS radio Friday afternoon, 'No, it has not been known that its . been there,' Browne said, denying that the building owners were aware . that their back alley contained a piece of evidence from the 2001 . terrorist attack. 'It . was just only recently observed because it's wedged between a very . narrow space between the rears of two buildings that almost touch.' Kelly said that the investigation will look at . the possibility that the part had been somehow lowered down into the narrow . space. The gear has a serial number visible next to the word ‘Boeing.’ It is unclear which of the two planes the new-found part belonged to, as both were Boeing aircrafts. Kelly said that on Monday, . the medical examiner will investigate to determine if there are any . human remains at the site, and it will then be determined how to move the . plane remnants. Intact: The gear found mere blocks from Ground Zero, bears a clear Boeing ID mark . ‘It’s a manifestation of a horrific terrorist act,’ Kelly . said, adding that this latest discovery may bring up difficult memories for the . families of the victims. Van Vanable, 63, a construction worker with Benson Industry . Local 580, has been working on the yet-to-be completed Freedom Tower just a few . blocks away. On Friday, he was sitting on a bench in his red work helmet . just steps away from the mosque building, next door to the Dakota Roadhouse . bar, when he says police officers converged on the area. ‘It’s an amazing situation,’ Vanable said of the discovery . made nearly 12 years after the 9/11 attacks. The 63-year-ld construction worker, who lives in Harlem, . came to Ground Zero a week after the tragedy and joined the massive cleanup . effort hauling away debris. Speaking to MailOnline, Vanable said he is not . surprised by the find. 5-feet: The chunk found Wednesday was 5-feet long and police say they've secured the area, pictured, 'like a crime scene' The inspectors were the ones to call police and since that call, the NYPD has secured the scene as if it were a crime scene in order to document it and catalog evidence. 'We're going to treat this as a crime scene for the next week at least,' Browne said. 'The medical examiner is an important part of the investigation to first see if there's any contamination of the soil that makes it any health safety on the soil below it on the ground. And then they will then make a determination, the office of the medical examiner, as to whether to sift for any possible human remains that might be associated with this find,' Browne said. Today's discovery of the sizable portion of a plane fuselage is not the first time that evidence from the tragic day were found on the streets of lower Manhattan. In previous years, large pieces from United Flight 175’s jet engines were found blocks away from where the planes crashed into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Those pieces, along with a 31-foot section of the broadcast antenna from the WTC's North Tower were shown as part of an FBI evidence exhibit that ran at Washington, DC's Newseum through 2012. A 10,000 pound elevator motor was also taken from the ruins and has become part of another exhibit at the 9/11 Memorial at Ground Zero. Small artifacts, like countless cell phones and even tinier human remains continue to be uncovered. About 60 truckloads of debris that could contain tiny fragments of bone or tissue were unearthed by construction crews that have been working on the new World Trade Center in recent years. Debris: Large chunks of engine from United Flight 175 (left) were found blocks from Ground Zero and a 31-foot piece of the North Tower's broadcast antennae (right) were displayed at Washington DC's Newseum until 2012 . Around 9,000 pieces of human remains too degraded for DNA matching have so far been found. More than 1.6 million tons of materials were moved from Ground Zero to the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island, and family members of some victims later sued saying the debris could contain human remains. The lawsuit was dismissed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008. New sifting efforts this month, the first since 2010, have so far uncovered at least 6 potential human remains from debris transported to a park atop the Staten Island landfill. Some 2,750 people died at the WTC in the 2001 attacks, but only 1,634 people have been identified. Some degree of closure came for dozens of families as 34 new positive identifications of victims have been found since 2006.","Police say the 5-foot piece of landing gear from one of the planes was found Wednesday lodged in a tiny alley just blocks from Ground Zero .

"Roberto Martinez says Everton will fully embrace the Europa League and make every effort to win another European trophy 30 years on from their last. The Toffees are in Switzerland to play Young Boys of Bern in the last 32, first leg and their manager is seeing it as an opportunity to rescue a sub-par season. The incentive of a place in next season’s Champions League is obvious but Martinez will be equally thrilled if his players can win Everton’s first European trophy since the Cup Winners’ Cup in 1985. Roberto Martinez (right) talks with Steven Naismith during Everton training on Wednesday . ‘We have been involved in big things in European football a long time ago and that is something that needs to run in our DNA and we want to have this on a consistent basis,’ he said. ‘In terms of the season, we have never, never had a real momentum in the league and that has been affecting us in our results. ‘We have been pristine in Europe and facing teams like Wolfsburg, Lille and Krasnodar, they become really important fixtures for us and, now, in the knockout stages we are really excited and looking forward to it. ‘For us to be involved in the Europa League is a phenomenal opportunity to grow as a team, especially the young players, and it is something we need at the club. ‘We are desperate to see our fans here and making it a real good memory in European football. Romelu Lukaku (centre) looks set for a starting role against Young Boys on Thursday night . Martinez says Everton will fully embrace the Europa League and make every effort to win another European trophy 30 years on from their last . ‘We embrace the competitions and look forward to it and take this competitive edge into the Premier League and finish the season as strong as we can.’ Everton’s inconsistent league form may see them a disappointing 4th in the Premier League but they have excelled in Europe. In the group stage, Wolfsburg, who lie second in the German Bundesliga, were beaten 4-1 at Goodison Park and 2-0 on their own group, while the Toffees also took four points off French side Lille. But Young Boys, who are second to Basle in the Swiss top flight and play on an artificial surface at the Stade de Suisse, will represent a fresh challenge. The Everton boss was speaking at a pre-match press conference ahead of the Europa League tie . They have won their last seven European home games here, including group stage wins over Napoli (2-0), Slovan Bratislava (5-0) and Sparta Prague (2-0). ‘I have been very impressed and very surprised with Young Boys’ form,’ said Martinez. ‘They are a team that has been developing really strong form and have won eight and a draw in the last nine. That is impressive, impressive form. ‘The way they play at home with the Astroturf, they use that really, really well. Their positional play in possession is really impressive and they have good creativity with a very much attack-minded focus and that is why we are going to see such a good game.’ The Young Boys squad, currently second in the Swiss Super League, train ahead of hosting Everton . Steve von Bergen (left) challenges with Marco Buerki, during a training session in Bern . The return of European football after its winter pause sees the resumption of Thursday-Sunday football for Everton, but Martinez is confident they have the squad to cope. ‘You are talking about a period of three weeks where we have got five games. It is important we share the demands in the squad. ‘That's why I am so happy to get players back from injury and coming back into the side. It has given us a real strength in depth. ‘They are the sort of periods where, as a football club, we need to show we are ready to performance in Europe and ready to show it does not affect our domestic form and make sure we look forward to playing on Thursday and then on Sunday and consistently without dropping the level of performance.’","Roberto Martinez believes European football 'needs to run' in Everton's DNA .

"Snapchat is looking to raise as much as $500 million in a new funding round that would value the mobile messaging company at up to $19 billion. The latest valuation is a massive increase for the company, which Facebook offered to buy for $3 billion in late 2013. Snapchat's previous funding round, completed late last year, valued the company at more than $10 billion. Snapchat which seeks to raise venture capital, if successful, could see its valuation shoot to $19 billion . Last year Snapchat leapfrogged Twitter to become the third most used social media app. Almost a third of 18 to 24-year-olds now use the self-destructing messaging app, which is more than double the amount of users the company had in November. Facebook still reigns as the most popular, however, with more than 75 per cent of millennials using it, closely followed by Instagram with 43 per cent. Executives of the company, which allows its more than 100 million users to send messages that disappear after a few seconds, are in advanced talks with fund managers, the person told Bloomberg. The investments being discussed would value Snapchat between $16 billion and $19 billion overall, Bloomberg reported. Los Angeles-based Snapchat could not be reached immediately for comment. The drastic increase in valuation comes as Snapchat continues to add to its active user base and extends its service. Last month it added it has partnered with 11 of America's top media brands, including DailyMail.com, in order to launch a new in-app news feature that will allow users to access a collection of the day's top stories and videos with just one swipe. The app's new 'Discover' feature, which launches today, features 12 unique news channels, one for each media partner, plus a dedicated Snapchat channel which will include original content from the app's creators. All of the media brands will handpick up to 15 different news stories and videos to feature on their own channels every day. It is also the latest evidence of a surge in venture capital financing for technology companies, that has produced some eye-popping valuations. Even at $19 billion, Snapchat would only be the third-most valuable tech startup that does not trade its shares publicly. According to research firm CB Insights, Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi is worth $46 billion and app-based taxi service Uber is valued at $41 billion.

"Fiorentina head coach Vincenzo Montella believes they have pulled off quite a coup in coaxing Mohamed Salah from Chelsea, having lost star turn Juan Cuadrado to the west London club. Impressive performances for club and country saw the Blues fork out £26.8million to bring the World Cup star from the Stadio Artemio Franchi to Stamford Bridge earlier this month. Cuadrado's deadline-day move to west London paved the way for Salah to go the other way, having endured a frustrating first year at Stamford Bridge. Fiorentina boss Vincenzo Montella believes they've pulled off a coup in coaxing Mohamed Salah from Chelsea . The sale of their star Juan Cuadrado to the west London club is also something for Fiorentina to be proud of . The Egypt international will spend the rest of the campaign on loan at Fiorentina, for whom he netted one and provided another in Saturday's 3-1 win at Sassuolo - a display Montella believes is just the start. 'Well, I think we pulled off a bit of coup ourselves in signing Salah,' the former Fulham loanee said ahead of their Europa League tie with Tottenham. 'Joking aside, it is almost a sign of professional pride that someone wanted to pay so much for Cuadrado and that he developed so much as a player. 'He certainly wasn't at that level when he first arrived to play for us, so I think us, the management, the players are very proud about how far he has been able to go with our help. Montella says Cuadrado wasn't a £26.8m-worthy player when he first arrived at the Italian club . 'But we haven't just replaced him with one player, we have replaced him with several players. 'Salah is a very good player, he is used to playing at this level and although he has only been with us a short while, he has already shown very quickly that he is certainly up to playing very well in Italy and playing well for us.' Montella's side are flying right now, arriving in north London with a Coppa Italia semi-final to look forward to and their hopes of Champions League qualification alive. Salah is one of several players Fiorentina have brought in with the fee from Chelsea for the Colombian . Spurs, too, have enjoyed an impressive time of late, thanks in no small part to the exquisite form of homegrown star Harry Kane. The 21-year-old's incredible progress makes him a shoe-in for the next England squad and has caught the attention of Fiorentina captain Manuel Pasqual ahead of the last-32 first leg tie. 'We have seen him the way that he has exploded onto the scene and no doubt that he is one of their best players,' the defender said.

"Kobe Bryant says he's driven to return to the NBA to see if he can continue to play at the highest level. The LA Lakers guard was ruled out of for the rest of season in January after tearing a right rotator cuff in his shoulder against the New Orleans Pelicans. The 36-year-old has subsequently had surgery to repair the injury but now faces a nine-month rehabilitation process for the second-time in two years, following suffering a torn Achilles against the Golden State Warriors in April 2013.

Bryant yells upon recalling be told by the doctor how long he will be out for in Kobe: The Interview, a new special that first aired on Monday on NBA TV. 'I just did nine months [of injury rehab]. And I gotta do it again.' Reports have since speculated that the five-time NBA champion would retire with just one more year left remaining on his contract, something that the shooting guard denies. 'The process of it. I wanna see if I can. I don't know If I can but I want to find out,' he says when asked what focuses him to make an injury comeback. 'I'm going to do what all I do is, which is break everything down to it's smallest form and smallest detail.

"Formula One drivers are to be barred from changing helmet designs during the course of a season in a ruling aimed at helping fans identify their heroes and also pleasing traditionalists. It will be less well received by those drivers who like to change the look of their lids with some frequency. The decision was taken by the governing FIA's Formula One Commission, which met on Tuesday, one of those present confirmed to Reuters. It has yet to be ratified by the World Motor Sport Council. Jenson Button is another driver whose been known to change his designs throughout the F1 season . Lewis Hamilton will be affected by Formula One's made the decision to ban helmet design changes . 'The FIA is keen to have stability so people can identify who is in the car,' said the source. 'The new phenomenon of drivers changing helmet every few races isn't helping.' The news received a mixed response on social media, with sportscar racer and former F1 driver Alexander Wurz one of those critical of the decision. Australian Mark Webber, who left Formula One at the end of 2013 and now races for Porsche in sportscars, suggested there were 'bigger issues than this' for the sport to address. Others pointed out that one-off helmets, such as the special design worn by Jenson Button in 2011 and auctioned off to raise funds for victims of a Japanese earthquake and tsunami, would not be allowed. Nor would tribute helmets, such as the James Hunt one worn by Kimi Raikkonen in 2013. According to the autosport.com website, four times world champion Sebastian Vettel has used some 60 different designs since his debut in 2007 -- although he said recently he was likely to stick with one now he was at Ferrari. Former Red Bull driver Mark Webber dismissed the new plans and pointed out that there are 'bigger issues' Tribute helmets like this one worn by Kimi Raikkonen are no longer allowed during the course of the season . Sebastian Vettel will be recognised by his helmet with the new ban coming into place by Formula One . The frequent changes have rankled with more traditionally-minded fans, who yearn for the days when drivers were easily recognisable by helmet colours and when cars also had much bigger numbers on their sides.

"Roberto Martinez and his Everton squad have arrived in Switzerland to prepare for their Europa League battle against Young Boys on Thursday. The first-leg of their last 32 encounter in Bern pitches Everton against the Swiss Super League’s second side, who are eight points off Basle at the top. Whereas the picture is quite different for Roberto Martinez's side who are just five points above the Premier League relegation zone but a Europa League victory could appease any worries about the drop. Everton manager Roberto Martinez leads his squad off the plane in Bern ahead of facing Young Boys . Kevin Mirallas and Ross Barkley walk off the plane having flown to Switzerland for a Europa League clash . Last time out for Everton, on February 11, they lost 1-0 at Chelsea in a fiery but promising contest. Their valiant display was overshadowed by a brawl at the end of the defeat at Stamford Bridge. Gareth Barry was sent off for a second bookable offence after tripping Willian. That particular foul sparked a melee between both sides in which Branislav Ivanovic locked his arm around James McCarthy’s neck. As a result Chelsea and Everton were charged by the FA for failing to control the conduct of their players.

"A former executive of the bank that helped trigger the Royal Bank of Scotland's collapse has been found dead along with his wife and daughter. Jan Peter Schmittmann, 57, came under fire for taking a large pay-off after the nationalisation of his troubled bank ABN Amro. He ran the domestic operations of the Dutch bank between 2003 and 2007 and was widely criticised for landing a £6.6million ($10.95 million) pay-off. Jan Peter Schmittmann, 57, former Netherlands chief executive of the ABN Amro bank, who has been found dead along with his wife Nelly (right), 57, and daughter Babette, 22, at their home in the Dutch town of Laren . It followed the bank's collapse, takeover by RBS and subsequent nationalisation. Police in the Netherlands said they visited his house in . the wealthy commuter town of Laren, east of Amsterdam, early on Saturday after being alerted . by a family friend. There they found his body along with those of his 57-year-old wife Nelly and 22-year-old younger daughter Babette. A police spokeswoman said an investigation was underway but that all early clues pointed to a family drama having taken place. There was no indication that Schmittmann's business dealings had played any role in the tragedy. The . daily Algemeen Dagblad said the three were found by Schmittmann's elder . daughter who had come to visit before departing for India, where she . had been due to do an internship. Happier times: Nelly and Babette Schmittmann are pictured together . Family tragedy: Babette Schmittmann, 22, daughter of Jan Peter Schmittmann . The elder daughter was in the care of wider family and the police victim care unit, police spokeswoman Leonie Bosselaar said. Schmittmann . paved the way for ABN Amro's break-up and sale in 2007 to a consortium . of the banks Royal Bank of Scotland, Fortis and Santander. After they came into difficulties . during the global financial crisis, the Dutch government nationalised . the core Dutch operations of ABN Amro. When . he left the bank after its nationalisation in 2008, Schmittmann was . contractually due a 16 million euro pay-off, a sum that was halved after . then finance minister Wouter Bos described it as 'exorbitant'. A spokesman for ABN Amro told MailOnline: 'We are all very shocked.' Jan Peter Schmittmann, who ran the domestic operations of the Dutch bank ABN Amro between 2003 and 2007, has been found dead along with his wife and daughter. The bank's London HQ is pictured here . A man walks past a Royal Bank of Scotland logo in the entrance hall of the company's offices in central London . For RBS - and the world economy - the deal to take over ABN Amro was a calamity. In 2007 RBS, led by the then Sir Fred Goodwin, was on its way to becoming the world's biggest bank, with assets of £1.9 trillion. But following the deal to buy up parts of ABN Amro, in a 73.3 billion euro ($100.5 billion) deal with Fortis and Banco . Santander SA, the shaky foundations on which the the RBS financial monster was built started to emerge. At the time the deal was the biggest banking takeover in history, but it quickly turned into a disaster. Not . only was it concluded at an inflated price after a hostile bidding . process, but just as the world economy teetered on the edge of the great . recession. Then Lehman . Brothers went out of business. That earthquake triggered a financial . tsunami which went on to flatten RBS, which had to be rescued by . taxpayers 12 months later at the cost of £45.2 billion. Five years on a Treasury Committee . report - titled 'The FSA'’s report into the failure of RBS' - concluded . that the Financial Services Authority should and could have intervened . in the doomed takeover. Goodwin, the bank’s former chief executive, was stripped of his knighthood in 2012, but has never been censured by the regulator as a result of RBS's collapse. Much of ABN Amro's operations had to be split . out to reform it following the collapse and in 2012 RBS 'sold' back to the Dutch lender parts of its businesses originally acquired in 2007. Selling . the Dutch business continued RBS's rapid downsizing of its global . banking and markets arm to restructure the bank and focus it more on UK . retail and commercial banking.","Jan Peter Schmittmann, wife and daughter found dead on Saturday .

"A training memo issued to Border Patrol agents appeared to tell them that they should not detain drunk drivers on one of the busiest sections of the US-Mexico border. The Department of Homeland Security memo told Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agents in the Tucson, Arizona, sector of the border that they have three options when they encounter intoxicated drivers: detain them at the request of local law enforcement, detain them without the involvement of another agency or let them go on their way. US Border Patrol agents in Arizona received a training memo that appeared to tell them they should let drunk drivers go on their way due to fears of a civil suit and a jurisdictional grey area with local law enforcement . The memo examined the civil liability of each of the three options, given that Border Patrol has no legal authority to arrest drunk drivers. It acknowledged that  it may feel counter-intuitive for an agent to let a drunk driver go on their way. 'There is no legal requirement for a Border Patrol agent to intervene in a state crime, including DUI,' and 'therefore there is generally no liability that will attach to the agent or agency for failing to act in this situation'. Should local law enforcement officers ask for an individual to be detained, border agents have no duty to detain the suspect - and doing so can increase the civil liability for the agent and the agency. However, the memo goes on to say that policy is to cooperate with local and state law enforcement officers who alert Border Patrol of suspected violations under state law. Local Border Patrol remember agent Michael Gallagher who was killed by a drunk driver in 2010. It is unlikely they would let a drunk driver go today . The third option is to detain a drunk driver with no request from local law enforcement. This poses the greatest liability for the agent and agency in the form of a civil law suit, according to the memo. Only by letting a drunk driver go free is the agent and agency free from liability. The memo does concede that an officer who chooses to detain a drunk driver is still 'acting within the course and scope of his employment'. Conservative groups have been quick to decry the contents of the memo which was first brought to light by Judicial Watch. 'Families across America are now at risk on the roads, as President Obama and his appointees at the Department of Homeland Security have given illegal aliens a license to drive drunk,' said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. However, Art Del Cueto, president of the Local 2544, the union that represents Border Patrol agents, told CBS 5: 'I can assure you that the agents I represent and the people I work with just would not release someone who was severely intoxicated.' He added that agents carry a certain moral authority after the 2010 death of agent Michael Gallagher near Casa Grande. Gallagher was killed on duty by a drunk driver. 'Especially since we were hit hard by the death of one of our own. How could we release them?' Del Cueto said. The group Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), said in a statement: 'MADD urges all law enforcement officers to protect the public by following standard procedures when encountering anyone suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Law enforcement is the first line of defense in preventing drunk and drugged driving, and their efforts are crucial to keep our roadways safe.' Customs and Border Patrol released a statement to make clear that the intent of the memo was to inform agents of their legal options when encountering drunk drivers based on judicial precedent, 'not direct [them] to detain or not detain these drivers'. 'In cases where Border Patrol agents encounter possibly impaired drivers, they are trained to exercise their professional judgment when assessing the current situation.'","A leaked training memo from the Department of Homeland Security tells Border Patrol agents they can let drunks driver go on their way .

"Scientists say they have created an anti-HIV drug so powerful that it could work as a vaccine. Macaque monkeys given the drug were able to fend off high, repeated doses of the simian version of the disease. The protein-based drug has been 'astonishingly effective' at blocking every major strain of HIV tested, marking a major step towards a cure for AIDS, the researchers claim. Scientists say they have created an anti-HIV drug so powerful that it could work as a vaccine. Macaque monkeys given the drug were able to fend off high, repeated doses of the simian version of the disease. Pictured is an image of HIV particles infecting a human cell . When HIV infects a cell, it targets the CD4 lymphocyte, an integral part of the body's immune system. HIV fuses with the cell and inserts its own genetic material -- in this case, single-stranded RNA - and transforms the host cell into a HIV manufacturing site. The prototype drug, called eCD4-Ig, is made up of two imitations of the receptors. These are the docking points where HIV latches on to CD4 cells — the key defences of the immune cells. The mimics latch on to the virus, tricking it into prematurely launching the docking procedure. The virus can only execute the procedure once, rendering it unable to attach to CD4 cells. The scientists likened the effect to closing the door to an intruder and tossing away the key. The technique works by using gene therapy to introduce a new section of DNA inside healthy cells. 'We show a way to achieve long-lived, effective vaccine-like protection from HIV 1', said study leader Michael Farzan, a professor at the Scripps Research Institute in Florida. The prototype drug, called eCD4-Ig, is made up of two imitations of the receptors, or docking points, where HIV latches on to CD4 cells — the key defences of the immune cells. The mimics latch on to the virus, tricking it into prematurely launching the docking procedure. The virus can only execute the procedure once, rendering it unable to attach to CD4 cells. The scientists likened the effect to closing the door to an intruder and tossing away the key. The drug provides 'very, very strong protection,' Professor Farzan said who wants to conduct human trials 'soon'. The team undertook a 40-week experiment which showed that inoculated animals thrived even after being injected with four times the dose needed to infect macaques in a 'control' group. Further research, to be unveiled at a conference in Seattle next week, found that the treated macaques 'continue to be protected from eight times and 16 times the infectious dose, more than a year after inoculation,' Professor Farzan said. The search for a vaccine has been one of the most frustrating chapters of the AIDS saga. Traditional antibody-based candidate vaccines have failed to put up more than a partial shield, partly because of mutations in the stealthy virus. 'This is an exciting new approach, but until the vaccine has been trialled in humans, there's no way of knowing how effective it will be,' said Dr Shaun Griffin, director of External Affairs at Terrence Higgins Trust . The new prototype formula, though, targets sites on the virus' so-called Env entry protein that are 'highly conserved' -  a scientific term meaning that these sites do not mutate very much. Lab-dish tests have found that the drug also works on human HIV, which is very close to simian version of the virus. 'Of course, we still need to do further safety studies in both macaques and humans,' before any trials can take place, Professor Farzan stressed. 'This is an exciting new approach, but until the vaccine has been trialled in humans, there's no way of knowing how effective it will be,' said Dr Shaun Griffin, director of External Affairs at Terrence Higgins Trust. The team undertook a 40-week experiment which showed that inoculated monkeys thrived even after being injected with four times the dose needed to infect macaques in a 'control' group . 'Although this vaccine was found to be effective in monkeys, HIV is an incredibly complex virus, with many different facets that we are still learning about.' Since 1981, about 78 million people have been infected by the HIV virus which destroys immune cells and leaves the body exposed to tuberculosis, pneumonia and other opportunistic diseases. Thirty-nine million have died, according to UN estimates. Antiretroviral drugs, invented in the mid-1990s, can treat infection, but cannot cure it or prevent it. Treatment is lifelong and carries side-effects. For many health systems, the drugs bill is spiralling, becoming a major burden to budgets.","Drug uses gene therapy to introduce new DNA inside healthy cells .

"A Hawaii fish collector who tore a scuba regulator out of the mouth of an anti-aquarium activist won't have to spend time in jail if he stays out of trouble under a plea agreement reached with prosecutors. Jay Lovell pleaded no contest to second-degree terroristic threatening on Tuesday, West Hawaii Today reports. He received a six-month deferred sentence and must also obtain an anger-management assessment as part of the agreement reached between prosecutors and Lovell's defense attorney. Scroll down for video . Ripped: Rene Umberger (photographed) and five other divers were filming Jay Lovell harvesting fish  off the coast of Hawaii's Big Island when Lovell ripped the regulator out of her mouth . Sentence: Lovell received a six-month deferred sentence and must also obtain an anger-management assessment as a result of the May 2014 incident . Lovell won't have to serve the time, and the incident may be removed from his record if he stays out of trouble for one year. Rene Umberger and five other divers were filming Lovell harvesting fish in about 50 feet of water off the coast of Hawaii's Big Island when Lovell ripped the regulator out of Umberger's mouth. Umberger and her fellow divers filmed as Lovell collected fish for the aquarium trade, which is legal, but unpopular with conservationists. Umberger took the stand briefly to ask that Lovell's fishing license be suspended during the deferment period. But 3rd Circuit Court Chief Judge Ronald Ibarra told her the court must abide by the terms of the plea agreement. 'That act of ripping out my air supply was terrifying and dangerous, and if it had occurred to someone who did not have as much experience as I did, they might well have died,' said Umberger, a coral reef consultant for Humane Society International. Just days after the incident, Umberger told Hawaii News Now, that she wanted her attacker arrested and charged with attempted murder. 'Attempted murder would be very difficult (to prove) because we would have to show that he attempted to kill her and we didn't feel we had that in this case,' a prosecutor said, according to Yahoo News. The prosecutor also noted that Lovell did not hold on to the breathing apparatus and Umberger was able to quickly retrieve it. Umberger has said she and fellow divers approached Lovell with cameras to document him collecting tropical fish on the reef. A video of the May 2014 incident shows a collector quickly swimming about 30 to 40 feet toward a diver who is filming them and ripping out her air-supply regulator. A snorkeler watching from above filmed the scene with another camera. Video: In a video of the incident, Umberger and fellow divers film Lovell and another fisherman . Swimming: In a video of the incident, Lovell is seen swimming toward Umberger as she and the other divers film him and another fisherman . Pulling: Here, Lovell is seen with the breathing apparatus after pulling it from Umberger's face . Lovell's attorney said last year that Lovell felt threatened when confronted by the group of divers and acted in self defense, the Huffington Post reports. Lovell spoke very little during Tuesday's court proceedings. Instead, his brother James Lovell and his lawyer Marcus Landsberg attempted to cast Lovell in a positive light, noting the man's past selfless acts while claiming he did not go looking for trouble the day of the incident, according to WHT. In an interview after the proceedings, Lovell told the WHT that the divers came looking for him that day. 'I didn’t go looking for it,' Lovell said. 'It does look like we’re going to get protection from this and the next time they’ll be the ones who get arrested.' Lovell also said that he needs to focus on his wife's health issues. 'That’s way more important than fighting with these people over fish,' he said. Came Looking: In an interview after the proceedings, Lovell said that the divers came looking for him that day . No Remorse: In a post to her Facebook page, Umberger wrote that Lovell showed no remorse for his actions . Just months after the incident, Lovell's brother told WHT that Umberger made statements at a meeting a year earlier that she would 'sic' Sea Shepherd -- a non-profit conservationist organization that uses direct action tactics to protect marine life -- on tropical fish collectors. It was revealed that Umberger was on a Sea Shepherd boat the day of the incident. Lovell's brother said in an email to WHT last year that the boat diverted its course and came within 100 feet of Lovell and his fellow fishermen. Once the fishermen were identified, Umberger and other divers followed the fishermen into the water and began disrupting their work.","Hawaii fish collector Jay Lovell won't have to spend time in jail if he stays out of trouble under a plea agreement reached with prosecutors .

"Stand-up comedian and actor Omid Djalili – long-time Chelsea supporter – was shocked by the video footage of fans racially abusing a passenger on the Paris Metro. Djalili, born in London to Iranian parents, witnessed violence and racism on the Stamford Bridge terraces in the 1970s and 1980s and sees the widespread condemnation of the fans’ actions as a good thing for society. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the footage - WARNING: CONTENT MAY OFFEND READERS . To say I was shocked and dismayed when I saw the video is an understatement. At first I thought it was a random thing posted on twitter so I've been pleasantly surprised that people are making a fuss about it. I’m glad it's being taken seriously because when you break it down the behaviour is appalling. World-wide condemnation of this sort of thing, however small in the grand scheme of things, is a good thing for society. Everyone has a video camera on their phone these days, linked in to social media, so more cases are exposed and more people are standing up and saying enough is enough. It's good to remind ourselves that it wasn't always the case. The man attempts to board  but is refused entry by supporters  travelling to the Champions League tie in Paris . The man attempts to board  but is refused entry by supporters  travelling to the Champions League tie in Paris . The man is pushed away from the carriage and is subjected to vile racist chants by the supporters . The man attempts to forcibly gain entry to the Metro train but struggles with passengers already on board . The amateur footage goes on to show passengers in the carriage following the disgraceful incident . Back in the 1970s and 1980s the violence was far worse. I remember as a teenager seeing people being abused or beaten up every two or three games. So-called ‘football fans’ did this regularly and no one would do a thing – everyone would keep their heads down and stay quiet. What was amazing was that man in Paris, after being pushed off once tried to get on the train again because he couldn't accept what was happening - I know I would have recognised these were nutters and would have just moved along to the next entrance. But that's a Pavlovian reaction I'd have because I'm used to avoiding drunken behaviour. This man just didn't compute. You hear the blokes chanting football songs so you'd assume they're football fans but I'd call them fans of alcohol and thuggery, fans of a group mentality where it's supposedly ok to push a black man off a train and then chant about racism and say ‘that’s the way we like it’. It's alcohol-fuelled behaviour – and that is the problem. We tend to forgive people and excuse their behaviour by saying ‘he’s had a drink’, but in my mind that's just not acceptable any more. Comedian Omid Djalili has condemned the actions of those Chelsea fans on the Paris Metro . Djalili, a Chelsea fan, witnessed violence and racism on the Stamford Bridge terraces in the 1970s and 1980s . This is not just a football problem. These people may identify themselves as football fans - and Chelsea should do everything to keep them away from the club and ban them (not for life I would add, there's always room for improvement in all our lives) – but it's a wider societal problem. Chelsea are owned by a Russian and half the players are black or multi national, and as a club have already done so much to curb this behaviour. I certainly have not seen this at Stamford Bridge for years. We need fans to stand up and show that we will not tolerate behaviour like this. I sit near the away fans at Chelsea and we’ve had issues with people goading the opposition and passing it off as ‘banter’. Kids talk about this is schools about the line between ""banter"" and offensive and hurtful behaviour. But deep down everyone knows when a line is crossed. What's needed is people with a voice to stand up and say that they are crossing the line and should stop. It makes me genuinely happy and very hopeful when I see that this is happening. We are evolving. Finally. The unsavoury scene has overshadowed Chelsea's 1-1 Champions League last 16 draw at PSG on Tuesday .

Blues goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois (centre) looks on as Cavani's header beats him in the second half . Kick It Out chairman Lord Ouseley (far left) has condemned the incident and called for action by Chelsea . The Professional Footballers' Association condemned the 'group of so-called Chelsea fans' and PFA deputy chief executive, Bobby Barnes, said: 'I am extremely saddened that such a great football club has had its name dragged into the gutter by a very ignorant minority who seemingly equate supporting Chelsea and cheering for the likes of Didier Drogba, Ramires and John Obi Mikel, with abusing a fellow passenger on a train who was going about his own business. 'I am sure that Chelsea will seek to take strong action against the supporters shown in the video as the club works very hard through their community and education programmes.' Kick It Out chairman Lord Ouseley echoed their stance, and said: 'I was shocked that Chelsea fans were still behaving like this. 'I thought the club had made it quite clear and taken action about stopping any repetition, knowing Chelsea, how hard they've worked on these matters, with fans as well as players, that it was unlikely to occur. 'The fact it involved an assault as well, of the individual that they pushed off the train, was even more shocking. Clearly it sends out a strong signal to, not only Chelsea, but the whole of football, that you cannot be complacent and think the actions you're taking are sufficient to deal with the scourge of racism, sexism, homophobia and anti-Semitism.

"Likely Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush on . Wednesday will seek to lay to rest any concerns that his views might be influenced by the legacies of . his father and brother. Bush, son of former President George H.W. Bush and brother . of former President George W. Bush, will address the issue . head-on in a speech at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs this afternoon, and will say, according to prepared marks, 'I am my own man.' It will be his first major foray into foreign policy since . the former Florida governor announced in December that he is strongly considering a run for the 2016 Republican presidential . nomination. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Running for president as part of a family dynasty is presenting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush with inevitable comparisons to his father and brother that he must address as he moves closer to a campaign for the White House. Today he will attempt to separate his views from theirs during a Chicago speech . In his brother's shadow: Jeb, right, will say in his speech today that he loves his older brother George, center, 'but I am my own man' Speech excerpts released by his political action committee, Right to Rise, show that Bush will say he has been lucky to have a father and a . brother who have shaped U.S. foreign policy and that he . recognizes 'my views will often be held up in comparison to . theirs - sometimes in contrast to theirs.' 'I love my father and my brother. I admire their service to . the nation and the difficult decisions they had to make. But I . am my own man, and my views are shaped by my own thinking and . own experiences,' he will say. Bush is casting a wide net for advice on national security. An aide provided to Reuters a diverse list of 20 diplomatic and . national security veterans who will be offering informal advice . to Bush in the coming months. Many of them are from past Republican administrations, . including those of his father and brother as well as that of . Ronald Reagan. The list includes people representing a wide spectrum of . ideological views in the Republican Party, from the pragmatic to . the hawkish. It includes James Baker, known for his pragmatism . in key roles during the Reagan and George H.W. Bush . presidencies, and former World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz, a . hawk as deputy defense secretary who was an architect of George . W. Bush's Iraq War policy. Among others are two former secretaries of Homeland . Security, Tom Ridge and Michael Chertoff, former national . security adviser Stephen Hadley and a deputy national security . adviser, Meghan O'Sullivan, as well as two former CIA directors, . Porter Goss and Michael Hayden. With polls showing Bush a front-runner among Republican . candidates jockeying for the 2016 nomination, his aim is to set . his own course on US foreign policy without getting entangled . in a debate about the legacy of his father and older brother. Bush has said in the past that he supports his brother's . decision to go to war in Iraq in 2003, which could leave him . open to attack from Democrats should he win the nomination. His . complaint about the recent past in Iraq is that President Barack . Obama has let American influence wane in the region. 'Each president learns from those who came before, their . principles, their adjustments,' Bush will say. 'One thing we . know is this: Every president inherits a changing world, and . changing circumstances.' Pre-butting Bush's afternoon speech, the Democratic National Committee circulated a 2010 clip of Bush refusing to criticize his brother's tenure at the White House during an appearance on CNN's State of the Union. After then-host Candy Crowley asked Jeb which of his brother's policies he most disagreed with, the younger Bush - accompanied by his father for the interview - said, 'I’m the only Republican that was in office when he was in office as President that never disagreed with him and I’m not going to start now.' Bush argued that it wouldn't make sense with his brother out of office to begin critiquing him. 'I’m not going to start now. It’s just till death do us part,' he said. 'Til death do us part': The Democratic National Committee pushed back on Bush's assertion that he won't be influenced by his brother or father by circulating a 2010 clip of Jeb refusing to criticize his brother's leadership . With both his father, who held the presidency for just one term before being ousted by Bill Clinton, and brother's legacies now threatening to overshadow his on presidential aspirations, Bush now finds himself in the precarious position of needing to visibly separate his policies from theirs without throwing either to the wolves. Bush's Chicago speech is the second in a series of . appearances designed to outline the foundation for what is . likely to be a presidential campaign. Two weeks ago in Detroit at the launch of his leadership PAC he discussed his views on reducing income inequality and . bolstering the U.S. economy. His Chicago speech comes as the United States grapples with . the threats posed by Islamic State militants and Russia's . aggression in eastern Ukraine. Obama has relied heavily on air strikes against Islamic . State targets in Syria and Iraq, but the militants retain large . swathes of territory in both countries. The United States has joined with European allies to impose . sanctions on Russia that have had an impact but have yet to . force Moscow to pull back. Bush will criticize Obama's handling of foreign policy and . say that American leadership must projected consistently. 'Under this administration, we are inconsistent and . indecisive,' he will say. 'We have lost the trust and the . confidence of our friends. We definitely no longer inspire fear . in our enemies.' His list of advisers suggests a willingness to listen to a . variety of views from people with long experience, including . former World Bank President Robert Zoellick. Others include Paula Dobriansky, a former undersecretary of . state, Kristen Silverberg, a former U.S. ambassador to the . European Union, Lincoln Diaz-Balart, who was a long-time member . of the House of Representatives from Florida, and John Hannah . who was Vice President Dick Cheney's national security adviser.","Bush, son of former President George H.W.

"The schoolgirls kidnapped in Nigeria by Islamic militants have been sighted for the first time, it was reported locally last night. More than 200 girls were snatched from their school five weeks ago by Boko Haram, a terrorist group linked to Al-Qaeda. The girls have been tracked to three camps in the north of Nigeria, near Lake Chad, 200 miles from where they were abducted, senior officials told a Nigerian newspaper. Scroll down for video . More than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram five weeks aog have been spotted in camps near Lake Chad, nearly 200 miles from where they were last seen (file pic) Abubakar Shekau, leader of Boko Haram, has threatened he will sell the girls into the sex trade or as wives unless the government frees militants that have been jailed . However, they added that it may still take a week to free the girls. ‘It has been a most difficult but heroic breakthrough,’ a senior military official told Nigeria’s Premium Times newspaper. Another added: 'Our team first sighted the girls on April 26 and we have been following their movement with the terrorists ever since.' The development comes after 150 people were killed in bomb and gun attacks by the militants across the country this week. On Tuesday night a double car bombing in a market in the central city of Jos killed at least 130 civilians, while two days later another 48 died when militants stormed and burned settlements near Chibok. Boko Haram have killed more than 2,000 in terror attacks in the last 12 months in Nigeria, including 130 who died in the city of Jos on Tuesday when two car bombs detonated . Just two days after the bombings, another 48 people died when militants attacked settlements near Chibok, burning homes and looting possessions . Boko Haram released a video two weeks ago showing some of the abducted girls in veils and reciting from the Qu’ran, and claimed they had converted to Islam. Their leader Abubakar Shekau offered to trade the girls for the release of prisoners, which was declined by the Nigerian government . Boko Haram's leaders had been threatening to sell the girls as brides for as little as £12, or force them to work in the sex trade if their demands were not met. But as the beleaguered Nigerian military closed in on the kidnapped girls, US Secretary of State John Kerry appeared in the dark about the rescue mission. John Kerry today claimed the US is the only country looking for the schoolgirls, despite the fact that both France and Britain have sent teams to help . Speaking to the State Department marking . the 90th anniversary of the creation of the American diplomatic service, . Mr Kerry said: 'And Boko Haram, Nigeria, only the United States is . there offering the assistance to help find those young women. According to The Telegraph, he added: 'Other countries not only aren’t there invited, but they didn’t even offer. That’s a difference, and I think it’s a difference worth dwelling on.' The comments were made despite the fact that both English and French forces have been sent to the African state to assist in the rescue, including three teams of UK advisors, and an RAF search aircraft. The Nigerian government recently voted to extend a state of emergency which has already been in place for a year as militants stepped up both the range and ferocity of their attacks. More than 2,000 people have been killed by Boko Haram attacks in the last 12 months alone, compared to 3,600 in three years between 2010 and 2013. Boko Haram, which means ‘Western education is a sin’, is fighting to overthrow the government and create an Islamic state within Nigeria ruled by Sharia law. The United Nations security council officially designated Boko Haram a terrorist group with links to al-Qaeda on Thursday, and imposed sanctions on it including an arms embargo, asset freeze and travel ban. The Foreign Office declined to comment.","Nigerian military says it has sighted more than 200 missing schoolgirls .

"A mother-of-three calmly returned to her care home job moments after learning she had scooped nearly £7 million on the lottery. Paul Lawton, 56, called his wife home from work to help him double check  their winning numbers. But rather than starting the celebrations straight away Deborah Lawton, 49, went back to work to finish her shift, despite being £6.9m better off. The couple now plan to spend the money on making their family secure and providing a better home for their eldest daughter Tracey, who has cerebral palsy. Paul and Debbie Lawton, pictured with their daughters Deborah, Tracey and Nicola, celebrating their £6.9 million lottery win . Long distance lorry driver Mr Lawton was out on the road when he stopped to pick up some food and the lottery ticket. But it was not until Sunday morning after he had helped Tracey, get dressed that he got round to checking his numbers. Mrs Lawton, 49, pictured with her husband Paul, calmly returned to work after double checking their winning ticket . He said: 'One...two...oh, I've matched three numbers,' I thought. Then four, five and six matched too, so I checked them again, then I double-checked the date, and then I think I sat down in the armchair. 'I'm generally quite a calm person so didn't get too excited at this point but instead called Deborah at work and asked her to come home for 10 minutes.' After Mrs Lawton had checked the numbers and returned to work, she called younger daughters Nicola and Deborah to ask them around later that afternoon. She said: 'I rang them to say we had some good news and could they pop round with their other halves. They arrived at 3pm sharp and Paul and I simply said 'We've won almost £7 million on the Lotto'. 'They all went pale and looked like they were going to pass out, then started shaking and shrieking with excitement. Tracey doesn't speak, but she just looked at us all like we had lost our minds - it was priceless. 'At that point we thought it was time to celebrate, so we cracked open the beers and had a little party, just the family together. It was a very special evening.' Mr Lawton of Withernsea near Hull, is now planning to start searching for a new home. 'We live in a house that has been modified with Tracey's needs in mind but this win means that we can now search for a lovely big bungalow that can be fitted out properly,' he said. The couple are now planing to spend their millions making sure their family are safe and secure . 'It will enrich her life so much and that's the most important thing on the agenda. Then we can look after Nicola and her husband and our wonderful three grandchildren, along with Deborah and her partner, who are expecting their first baby later this year.

"This is the horrific injury sustained by a 64-year-old pensioner after a drunken actor bit off part of her finger during a row on a bus. Gary Bradley, 29, attacked Kathleen Hainey on a bus in Greenock, Renfrewshire, on October 22 last year when she tried to stop him pestering a teenage girl. Bradley, who admitted being drunk at the time, also attacked 43-year-old Brian Thomas, biting and punching him in the head and arm, when he also tried to intervene. Gary Bradley, 29 (left), has been jailed for four years after a drunken attack on a bus during which he bit an inch off the little finger of Kathleen Hainey, 64 (right) Bradley was harassing 19-year-old Nicole Shirley when fellow passenger Brian Thompson, 43, tried to stop him. After the pair began fighting Mrs Hainey tried to separate them and Bradley bit her . Edinburgh High Court heard that Bradley, who was previously sentenced to five years in jail for serious assault, had been waiting with his victims at a bus stop before the attack occurred. While waiting for the bus to arrive Bradley tried to speak to Nicole Shirley, 19, but she told him she was not interested and moved away. Once everyone had boarded the bus Bradley again tried to talk to Miss Shirley. When Mr Thomas offered to get off at the same stop to protect her, Bradley became angry. He swung at Mr Thomas, who grabbed him in an attempt to stop the struggle, when Bradley bit him on the head and left forearm . Mrs Hainey got up from her seat and tried to separate the pair when Bradley bit the tip of her left little finger off. She was taken to hospital where she was given a tetanus shot and had the wound washed with anti-septic. She was then examined by surgeons who had to remove an inch of her finger. Sitting at the High Court, Lady Rae said: 'One [victim] was a 43-year-old man who was simply trying to stop you pestering a young woman who was clearly disinterested in your drunken and unwanted attentions. 'The second person was a 64-year-old lady who bravely tried to intervene to stop the fight. 'Not satisfied with biting the man, you reacted to her attempts to stop the fight by biting the tip of her finger off, resulting in operative treatment which led to amputation of part of her finger.' Defending Bradley, Thomas Ross said he had trained as a barber and was working as an actor on a couple of local productions. He said he had also been caring for his ill mother. Mr Ross added that Bradley’s brother had been fatally stabbed in 2013 which led to a man’s conviction for culpable homicide. He said: 'He [Bradley] was heavily under the influence of alcohol at the time of the offence. 'He has demonstrated a high level of remorse, particularly towards Kathleen Hainey. He has learnt a lesson.' The fight happened in October last year as the trio were riding on a bus along Burns Road, in Greenock, Renfrewshire (file image) The judge told Bradley, formerly of Kylemore Terrace, Greenock, that he would have faced a six-year prison term, but for his early guilty pleas. She instead locked him up for four years, saying the sentence should run consecutively to a nine-month jail term he is already serving. Bradley interrupted the judge during her sentencing and announced he wanted to make a public apology. The judge said also noted that he knew he had 'anger management issues'. She said: 'I also note you are not unintelligent and have a work ethic.'","Gary Bradley, 29, harassed 19-year-old Nicole Shirley on bus last year .

"Jennifer Mills-Westley, who was beheaded by a Bulgarian schizophrenic as she shopped in a supermarket in Tenerfie . A mother who was beheaded by a Bulgarian schizophrenic as she shopped in a supermarket in Tenerife had no chance of defending herself, an inquest heard today. Retired road safety worker Jennifer Mills-Westley, aged 60 and originally from Norwich, was shopping in a Chinese-owned store in the resort of Los Cristianos on May 13, 2011, when she was attacked. A Spanish jury later ruled that Deyan Deyanov who murdered Ms Mills-Westley, was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time, and he was sentenced to 20 years in a secure unit in Seville. Today, her daughter Sarah Mills-Westley attended the inquest at Norfolk Coroner's Court in Norwich with other family members. Coroner Jacqueline Lake read out excerpts of the jury's verdict saying Ms Mills-Westley had been rendered defenceless by the brutal, abhorrent attack. She said: 'Mr Deyanov picked up a ham slicing knife from a shelf. 'He attacked her from behind, stabbing her repeatedly in the neck until her head was completely severed. 'He then picked up her severed head and walked outside. 'Her capacity to react and defend herself or even runaway was completely impaired by the defendant. 'He ensured he could kill his victim without any risk to himself.' Scroll down for video . Ms Lake said a post-mortem revealed Ms Mills-Westley had bled to death and that Deyanov had been in an 'acute' phase of schizophrenia at the time, meaning he could not discern reality. The coroner returned a narrative verdict that Ms Mills-Westley died after an attack by a person she did not know from which she could not defend herself. She added: 'This was an absolutely abhorrent event.' Tourists watched in horror as Deyan Deyanov beheaded Ms Mills-Westley and ran off with her head before he was chased by security guards and tackled to the floor, pictured . The family declined to comment as they left the inquest. Deyanov had previously been admitted to the Ablett psychiatric unit at Glan Clwyd Hospital, Bodelwyddan, near Rhyl in June 2010 while he stayed at a relative's home in Flint. An independent report published by Healthcare Inspectorate Wales concluded there were 'clear shortcomings' relating to the care provided in North Wales. It said: 'It is difficult to determine how these deficiencies may have directly influenced and led to the events of May 2011. Deyan Deyanov who murdered Ms Mills-Westley was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the attack . He was sentenced to 20 years in a secure unit in Seville. He had previously been treated Ablett psychiatric unit at Glan Clwyd Hospital, Bodelwyddan, near Rhyl, North Wales . 'However, we do not believe that had the issues that we identified within the report been addressed, that the likelihood of such an incident occurring might have been significantly reduced. Speaking after the report was released, Ms Mills-Westley's daughters Sarah and Samantha, said that had staff not missed his serious medical problems, their mother may still be alive today. In a statement they said: 'The Health Inspectorate of Wales report has highlighted a number of significant basic medical best practice failures. 'We are shocked to learn that the clearly prejudicial views of the medical staff severely compromised the diagnosis and therefore subsequent treatment of Deyan Deyanov.","Jennifer Mills-Westley was beheaded while shopping in Tenerife in 2011 .

"Bounding into the world weighing as little as 10lb, there are human babies that have been heavier than Winnie the pygmy hippo calf. She was born at Bristol Zoo Gardens three weeks ago and has since enjoyed romping around her enclosure with her father Nato and mother Sirana - who is ferociously protective. There are fewer than 2,000 of the rare beasts in the wild and when they are born, their mothers keep them concealed in thick vegetation and visit to breastfeed. Scroll down for video . Water baby: Winnie the pygmy hippo, left with her mother Sirana (also pictured right), has been born in captivity at Bristol Zoo Gardens and has spent three weeks romping around her enclosure - which includes a heated swimming pool. Just 2,000 of the beasts are left in the wild with their west African habitat facing destruction . Miniscule: The tiny hippo barely measures up to the bottom of the metal gate she is walking through, and weighs as little as some human babies . Glurgh! Once fully-grown Winnie will spend much of her life in the water, but for now it looks the heated pool in her enclosure will take some getting used to. Pygmy hippo mothers are extremely protective of their calves, and in the wild they keep them hidden in thick undergrowth where they visit periodically to nurse them to full growth . Mum's the word: The tiny hippo calves are almost completely helpless for the first three weeks of their lives and can only eat vegetation after three months . A leaf out of mum's book: Winnie weighs between 10lb and 14lb. Early explorers thought pygmy hippos were sweating blood because glands emit a clear reddish fluid . At Bristol Winnie has the luxury of a heated pool, a plentiful supply of food and no predators, but her mother is still keeping a watchful eye. Lynsey Bugg, assistant curator of mammals at the zoo, said Sirana is proving 'very maternal' with her newborn. 'Winnie follows Sirana a lot,' she added. 'Sirana is very protective and doesn't let her stay in deep water for too long. 'Young hippos tire easily and Sirana will quite often guide her baby into shallow water or bring her out of the pool. 'Winnie is doing brilliantly, she's putting on weight really well, she is starting to get a bit chunky. Feeling shy? Lynsey Bugg, assistant curator of mammals at the zoo, said Sirana is proving 'very maternal' with her newborn adding: 'Winnie follows Sirana a lot' Gone swimming: Winnie tests the water, right, with her mother. Once fully grown pygmy hippos can close their ears and eyes underwater, where they spend long periods . Conservation: Bristol Zoo Gardens is one of several zoos across the continent taking part in a captive breeding regime by the European Endangered Species Programme . Dwarfed: While Winnie's mother Sirana weighs up to 275kg (43st), that is still only a tenth the weight of the more widespread common hippopotamus . Pygmy hippos are hard to study as they are secretive, live in dense forest and females usually breed only once every two years. They ovulate for two to three days a month, similarly to humans, and call to males and leave pens messy when they are in the mood. Calves are born after six months and are helpless at first, unable to walk far or eat vegetation for three months. Pygmies are much smaller than the common hippo, from whom they split off as as separate species several million years ago. They have proportionally longer legs, a smaller head, less prominent eyes and . ears more towards the side of the head. The nose and ears can be closed underwater. Early explorers thought the animals were sweating blood because glands emit clear reddish fluid to keep their skin moist. In captivity pygmies live for about 30 years, breeding for themselves after five. 'I think people are quite surprised when they see how small she is because mum and dad are quite big.' While WInnie weighs between 4.5kg (10lb) and 6.2kg (1st) now, she will grow in adulthood to be as heavy as 275kg (43st). That pales in insignificance to the size of the more widespread common hippo, however, which are the third-heaviest land mammals on earth. Fully-grown adults reach between one and a half tonnes (236st) and three tonnes (472st). Bristol Zoo Gardens is part of an international breeding programme for the tiny hippos, which also includes zoos such as Edinburgh and Whipsnade, as fewer than 2,000 of them are thought to exist naturally in the wild. It is impossible to know how many are still alive because their habitats in west Africa, which includes Liberia, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone and Guinea, have been blighted by unrest and big business. Deforestation of the area around the Sapo National Park in Liberia, carried out by logging companies, is threatening one of the pygmy hippo's last known strongholds. Scientists have been using camera traps - live video feeds disguised in rocks, vegetation or trees - to monitor the patterns of how the naturally reclusive animals move through the dense forest. The captive breeding regime is taking place under the European Endangered Species Programme (EEP), with participating zoos across the continent. Nato and Sirana will have completed a long wait for a baby - as they are the only pygmy hippos currently living at the zoo, and females only breed in the wild once every two years. Ms Bugg said: 'The European programme is a . well-established and very successful programme and our male, Nato, is a . genetically important animal; by default, so will be his offspring.' 'Mum... I think someone's here to see us': Visitors will soon be able to flock to the pygmy hippo exhibit to see Winnie enjoying her heated bathing pool . Too cute for words: Female pygmy hippos breed only every two or so years, though they are similar to humans - they become fertile for two or three days every month and pregnancies last for six months. Like humans and unlike other African wildlife such as buck, pygmy hippo calves are more or less helpless for the first stages of their life .","Fewer than 2,000 of the tiny hippos survive in the wild after deforestation and war in their native west Africa .

"Putting on weight has a damaging effect on the heart - even if you are not overweight, new research suggests. For every five units of body mass index (BMI) increase in women, the risk of heart disease increases by 23 per cent - the equivalent of ageing two and a half years. The University of Oxford researchers found that the chance of coronary heart disease (CHD) increase not just with age, but with BMI too, with a rise in weight carrying the same risks as getting older. The findings held true even in women not considered obese, with small increases in BMI all contributing to the increased risk, the study found. Putting on weight has a damaging effect on the heart - even if you are not overweight, new research suggests . BMI is a height to weight ratio, measured in units. The WHO gives a 'normal' rating to a BMI of between 18.5 and 25. The researchers followed the health of 1.2 million women in England and Scotland for more than a decade. The findings, published in journal BMC Medicine, showed that the occurrence of CHD went up by 23 per cent for each five unit increase in BMI. This was the equivalent to ageing two and a half years. One in eleven lean middle aged women - with an average BMI of 21 - will be admitted to hospital or will have died from CHD between the ages of 55 to 74. But this risk progressively increases with BMI, and it reaches one in six, for obese women, with an average BMI of 34. Study author Dr Dexter Canoy said: 'The risk of developing CHD increases even with small incremental increases in BMI, and this is seen not only in the heaviest but also in women who are not usually considered obese. 'Small changes in BMI, together with leading a healthy lifestyle by not smoking, avoiding excess alcohol consumption, and being physically active could potentially prevent the occurrence of CHD for a large number of people in the population.' Other recent research found that office workers could be risking their health simply by sitting at their desk for hours at a time. The chance of heart disease increases not just with age, but with BMI too, with a rise in weight carrying the same risks as getting older . It found people who spend more than four . hours a day sitting down are at greater risk of chronic illnesses such . as cancer, diabetes and heart disease. Those sitting for at least six hours were significantly more likely to have diabetes. The research involved 63,048 middle-aged men but US scientists say the findings are likely to also apply to women. Professor Richard Rosenkranz, who led the study at Kansas State University, said the more people sat, the bigger the health problems. He said ‘We saw a steady stair-step increase in risk of chronic diseases the more participants sat. ‘The group sitting more than eight hours clearly had the highest risk.’ The latest study follows research last year on 222,000 people which found sitting down too long increases your risk of dying within three years, even among the physically active.","The chance of heart disease increased not just with age, but with BMI too, Oxford researchers found .

"A talented young opera singer left without a penny of his father's £2 million fortune has won a court payout to fund his music career - as long as he gets into a prestigious college. Miles Taylor, from Leeds, was just 17 when his father, Rochdale businessman, Peter Gardiner, died aged 56 in 2006, making 'no provision' for him in his will. Mr Gardiner left £350,000 to charity and put the rest of his money into a trust fund from which his illegitimate son was specifically 'excluded'. Opera singer Miles Taylor, 25, was left without a penny of his father's fortune but will win a payout to fund his career - as long as he gets into the Royal College of Music (pictured), or the Guildhall School of Music . But now a high court judge has effectively overruled Mr Gardiner and ordered that should Mr Taylor be accepted into either the Royal College of Music, or the Guildhall School of Music, his father's estate must foot part of the bill. The teenager excelled in music at Harrogate College and went on to study at the Leeds College of Music and the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester. He has now applied to the elite London institutions as part of his post-graduate studies. The executors of Mr Gardiner's estate had bitterly opposed the singer receiving any of the money. They even argued that Mr Taylor, now 25, 'did not have the musical talent' to succeed and that he was 'irresponsible with money', the court heard. However, Judge John Behrens rejected both those suggestions, describing Mr Taylor as a 'keen, talented and committed' singer with good prospects. His mother, Christine Taylor, told the court he had been passionate about singing since the age of 10 and thirsted for success on the opera stage. Judge Behrens, sitting at the High Court, rejected suggestions that Mr Taylor 'did not have the musical talent; to succeed, describing him as a 'keen, talented and committed' singer with good prospects . He had 'specific learning difficulties' but even a 2008 road accident - in which he suffered severe chest and internal injuries - had not held him back from achieving his ambition. Despite being cut off by his father, Mr Taylor sought 'reasonable provision' from his estate as a dependent. The executors pointed out that the estate had already paid more than £110,000 towards his maintenance and education costs. However, Judge Behrens ruled it was only right that Mr Taylor's post-graduate studies should be posthumously funded by his father. He was granted £6,500 from the estate to cover his student costs in 2015 and another £15,000 for the next two years. However, the judge said he would only get the £15,000 if accepted onto a post-graduate course. That, the court heard, will depend on how well Mr Taylor does in auditions due at the end of this month. According to online records, Mr Gardiner was born in 1949 and was a director of Oldham Security Accessories Limited and Gardiner Fire Limited.","Miles Taylor, 25, was 17 when businessman father Peter Gardiner died .

"Dr Ian Duncan (pictured) said his methods of communicating with animals are based on science . The tales of Dr Dolittle have captured imaginations since the books were written nearly 100 years ago. And now one Scottish scientists claims he can do just that using a 'strictly scientific method'. After years of research, Dr Ian Duncan will reveal his methods of communicating with pets and livestock at a conference next week. He started his work wanting to ask animals questions to check that they were happy with their living conditions and that they were being well cared for. Dr Duncan, Emeritus Chair in animal welfare at the University of Guelph, Canada, said his methods of communicating with creatures great and small are based on science, although he has acknowledged similarities to the character of Dr Dolittle, The Belfast Telegraph reported. ‘We are devising ways of “talking” to animals and putting questions to them about their welfare and happiness,’ he told The Sunday Times. ‘Each species has to be treated differently but the common factor is to devise tests where the animals are offered a choice.

Many people dream of talking to their pets (illustrated) and Dr Ian Duncan is devising ways of 'talking' to animals to ask them questions about their welfare and happiness . ‘If they make the same choice repeatedly...it shows what they want from us.’ A Scottish scientists claims he can 'talk' to animals like Dr Dolittle, played by Rex Harrison (pictured) in the 1967 film . The scientist will reveal his methods at a conference about animal welfare and sentience taking place in Washington next week, after spending years working with a number of pets and livestock species. Dr Duncan is interested in fundamental questions concerning the nature of sentience - the ability of animals to feel sensations - and its relationship to welfare. He is also committed to finding solutions to farm animal welfare problems through more applied research. His work in the 1980s and 1990s led to changes in the regulation of battery farms for hens and pigs. He has also spoken out against the religious slaughter of animals, used to produce kosher and halal meat as he believes livestock animals, from farmed fish to sheep, are smarter than people give them credit for. Dr Duncan said: 'It used to be thought that animals were ‘dumb’, driven by programmed instincts and responses, but now it is clear they live a much richer life than we ever realised and can remember the past and think about the future. ‘We can use that knowledge to ask questions about their care and then improve it.’ Dr Duncan is interested in fundamental questions concerning the nature of sentience - the ability of animals to feel sensations - and its relationship to welfare.

For dog owners eager to know what their pet is thinking, a prototype gadget could take pet-to-human communication to the next level. The No More Woof headset uses brain-scanning technology to detect a dog's thought patterns, analyse them and translate them into the spoken word. It has been developed by the Nordic Society for Invention and Discovery (NCID), a small Scandinavian research lab. Potential dog phrases already identified by the developers include: 'This is splendid!', 'Leave me alone', 'I am so very weary', 'Who are you?' and 'Erm, why are you guys leaving?' The technology used in No More Woof is a combination of the latest technologies in three different tech-areas, Electroencephalography (EEG) sensoring, micro-computing and special brain-computer interface software. In the last decade, huge discoveries have been made to map out the human brain’s functions, but the developers say it is the first time anyone made a serious attempt to apply this ground-breaking technology on man’s best friend.","Dr Ian Duncan from the University of Guelph, Canada uses a scientific method to ask animals about their care and state of mind .

"The most desirable version of one of the world’s most iconic cars is to have production relaunched – but only six models will be made. Jaguar yesterday announced plans to build ‘Lightweight’ E-types after the British firm only ever created 12 despite plans to manufacture 18.

The brand new six Lightweight E-types will be hand built in-house by Jaguar as ‘perfect reproductions’ and built to the original specification. The Lightweight was approximately 114kg (250lb) lighter than a standard E-type, due to its all-aluminium body and engine block. A lack of interior trim and exterior chrome work as well as a host of further weight-saving measures meant it was built for racing.

There is expected to be high demand for the six recreations, with the first one unveiled later this summer.

He added: ‘The Lightweight E-type is a stunning motorcar and one of the greatest sports cars of its day. ‘I think this is quite unique, re-manufacturing a car from 50 years ago. It is great that it will be skilled work as well. ‘They will be hugely expensive but there will be no shortage of interest from buyers. ‘There will be a lot of excitement about this and it shows the confidence at Jaguar since the TATA takeover.’ One of the 12 original lightweight E-Type Jaguars being raced at Silverstone in 1963 .

"A Canada couple who decided to crowdsource their daughter's name on the internet got precisely what they expected earlier this month. 'All bow down to the great and powerful Cthulhu,' read the Facebook announcement of the April 7 birth after 150,000 cast their votes over the last three months of Alysha McLaughlin's pregnancy.

Voters were given the opportunity to give the girl her middle name, too. However, as with the first name, the couple decided against the top middle moniker pick of All-Spark. They opted instead for two middle names: Savannah Joy. Other top 10 middle name picks were Of-The-Sea, Le-Dash-A, Salad and Pond, writes the Global News. Not that any of those choices really had a chance to begin with, as Stephen made clear in his announcement of the naming contest.

"This mysterious 'Arabic' scrawl found on several Southwest Airlines planes triggered security fears earlier this week and an investigation by the FBI. But aviation and language experts today claim they were the work of a lone graffiti artist - and are not actually Arabic at all. The special chemical paint appears towards the back of the 737 aircraft, but only after an auxiliary power unit on the plane is turned on - warming the underbelly, engines and landing gear. Scroll down for video . Spooky: The special chemical paint appears on several 737 aircraft, but only after an auxiliary power unit on the plane is turned on, warming the underbelly . The airline had suggested the symbols, . which only show up with heat and are believed to be vandalism, looked . like Arabic writing. However the Department of Arabic and Islamic . Studies at Georgetown University in Washington D.C. looked at the photos . for MailOnline and a spokesman concluded they are ‘not Arabic script’. Most of the affected planes appear to . be flying out of Los Angeles, California. Southwest Airlines said the . markings are not seen as a threat, but began appearing on the bellies of . its jets earlier this year. In a statement to KNX 1070 radio, . Southwest said it is working with authorities to uncover who was behind . the 'vandalism', but added that currently it is not clear how many . people are involved. ‘The markings have no affiliation to . any known group or activity,’ a Southwest spokesman said. ‘The markings . at this time are being considered vandalism.’ The markings have been appearing on . the airline's signature 737 jets for the past several months and vary in . appearance, the spokesman said. They began to appear in February, . reported Gawker. Security fears: The markings have raised alarm about someone's ability to get that close to an aircraft . The FBI and other law enforcement . agencies concluded the markings do not present a threat or a safety hazard and are vandalism - not terrorist-related, the . spokesman added. Officials did not say whether the . markings are messages of any sort, or if they are words or simply . scribbling. They do not know if they were made on purpose or were caused . by a mechanical issue. David Learmount, operations and . security editor of aerospace publisher Flight Global, told MailOnline he believes it was ‘an inside job’. ‘If it has been going on since . February and there have been no ill effects it doesn’t seem very . dangerous, because if it’s an insider with access to aircraft, why has . he not done harm in the intervening seven months if that were his . intent? He’s only made a few harmless daubs.’ He added graffiti artists are . often motivated by spraying in places where they should not be . allowed - and remain undetected. ‘Railways and railway property have . been popular worldwide - maybe they’re now targeting airlines and . airport property,’ he said. Southwest Airlines, which exclusively . uses 737 aircraft in its routes, had determined that there was no danger . to the planes or the passengers, the spokesman said. ‘We obviously take the behavior very . seriously and we will continue to involve local and federal law . enforcement as needed until the situation is resolved,’ the spokesman . added. Several theories have been put forward as to the origin of the writing, including vandalism by an employee. Charles Feldman broke the story after being tipped off by a source. He said: 'It does raise disturbing . questions about the security because anybody who has the ability to . write on an airplane and can get that close to do it, also has the . ability to do other things to that aircraft.' Arizona-based television channel ABC15 . had cited multiple sources as saying that the markings appear to be . Arabic words. But these pictures have since appeared on Gawker. The photos were sent to Gawker by a . Southwest employee, who said the markings are usually seen on the . exhaust pipe of engines and look like swords. He said he had not seen . any 'Arabic' writing.

"Shares in London hit their highest level since the turn of the century last night in a boost to investors and those saving for a pension. The FTSE 100 rose 41.08 points to 6898.13 – the second best close of all time and just 32 points off the all-time high of 6930 reached in December 1999 during the dotcom boom. Britain's index of blue chip companies has gained 5 per cent this year – adding £84billion to the value of investments – and has nearly doubled since the depths of the recession in 2009. The increase in share prices was described as 'great news' for investors in the stock market and workers saving for a pension. Millions of families have money tied up in the stock market through pension funds, ISAs and other savings. Boost: The London Stock Exchange (right) closed just 32 points off the all-time high of 6930 reached in December 1999 during the dotcom boom . The benchmark, which includes corporate giants from Tesco and Rolls-Royce to Vodafone and Barclays, is now within touching distance of the record high it reached during the dotcom boom. The rally will fuel speculation that the Footsie could finally reach the 7000 mark this year – particularly if the economic recovery continues. The latest gains in London came despite worries over Greece and its future in the eurozone as the Athens government clashed with European leaders over austerity and debt. George Godber, a fund manager at Miton Group, said he was 'very surprised' at the strength of the stock market – particularly given the ructions in Greece. Shares in London have been buoyed by the recovery in the UK economy which last year clocked up the fastest rate of growth of any major industrialised nation. Economists are predicting another good year in 2015 which could in turn boost share prices as corporate profits rise.

Shares in London have been buoyed by the recovery in the UK economy which last year clocked up the fastest rate of growth of any major industrialised nation. On the up: John Redwood (right), chief economist at stock broking firm Charles Stanley, put the rise down to low interest rates, the fast growing economy and falling oil prices . Economists are predicting another good year in 2015 which could in turn boost share prices as corporate profits rise. Official figures yesterday showed inflation in the UK has fallen to its lowest level for 55 years – making households feel richer as wages rise faster than prices. It is hoped that the slump in the price of essentials such as food and petrol will fuel the feel-good factor this year. Savers fed up with paltry returns on their nest eggs, as a result of record low interest rates, have also been attracted to the stock market. Tony Cross, a market analyst at online trading firm Trustnet Direct, said: 'This is great news for anyone saving for a pension or with investments in the stock market. 'The fact the FTSE 100 has posted its highest close this century is offering some much-needed respite for those investors who have backed equities. 'Add the record low borrowing rates to falling food and fuel prices, and it's shaping up to be a great year for UK consumers - even if the picture looks somewhat more downbeat on the Continent.' John Redwood, chief economist at stock broking firm Charles Stanley, said: 'Shares have risen because interest rate are low, the UK economy is growing faster than most of the advanced world, and companies are benefiting from improving business conditions. 'The lower oil price is boosting spending on other items which is also good for growth.' But others are less confident. Crispin Odey, one of the most successful hedge fund managers in the UK, last month warned that major economies are entering a recession that will be 'remembered in a hundred years'. Mr Odey, who is the founder of Odey Asset Management and made millions after correctly predicting the credit crunch, predicted that shares 'will get devastated'.","FTSE 100 closed just 32 points off the all-time high of 6930 in 1999 .

"In the top job: New BBC boss George Entwistle has admitted he wrote to the corporation, aged 6, to complain over its coverage . Too few women appear on our TV screens, the new head of the BBC admitted yesterday. George Entwistle said not enough had been done to promote female experts or ensure that they took part in news programmes. ‘We have made real progress in actively looking for, and finding, great female experts to front our big factual shows, but it’s not enough, and the world will always be profoundly demanding of the BBC on this question, and it should be,’ he added. ‘The Today programme struggles because we are dealing with party politics as it is, dealing with the world as it is, and that’s a very male place. What the BBC often reflects is the way the world is.’ In an interview with the Radio Times, he claimed progress had been made with female presenters such as Mary Beard of Meet the Romans and Lucy Worsley of Antiques Uncovered. And the director-general said he would love to see the return of Miriam O’Reilly, the presenter who won an age discrimination case against the broadcaster after she was dropped from Countryfile. When asked about Radio 4 newsreaders Charlotte Green and Harriet Cass taking voluntary redundancy, Mr Entwistle replied: ‘In what sense would it represent an advance of women’s circumstances to say, “We’re looking for volunteers for redundancy, you’re an older woman, you can’t have it”? It doesn’t sound particularly equitable, either.’ Complaint: A young Mr Entwistle writes to the BBC's 'derector' George Entwistle has revealed that as a six-year-old child he had written to the then director general to complain that it had pulled an episode of Tom and Jerry after a Budget speech overran. He has even still got a copy of the letter, which his father never posted, which shows he misspelt the job ‘derector’. Mr Entwistle said: ‘I had misspelt it “derector”. My father, underneath, had written Broadcasting House, London, and then failed to post it – very typical of my dad.’ In an interview with Radio Times he also revealed he had suffered a ‘junkie habit’ for acclaimed US drama The Wire, watching it four or five hours a night. On one occasion he said he watched a box set of the show from 9pm at night to 3am in the morning leaving him ‘totally wasted’ the following morning. The BBC chief also revealed that as a child he was a massive fan of Doctor Who. Looking forward to his new role he said he wanted to commission more Shakespearean productions following the success of the ‘Hollow Crown’ series. When asked to compare BBC shows he admitted he preferred The Archers to EastEnders, The Apprentice over Dragon’s Den, Radio 3 over Radio 2 and Radio 4 over Radio 5 Live. A clear fan of US drama he also revealed that he is ‘devoted’ to Mad Men, which the BBC lost to Sky after it rival bid significantly more for it. He said that one or two episodes of the US-made series set in a New York advertising agency were ‘as close to poetry that it’s possible for television to come.’ Mr Entwistle said as a 12-year-old his parents thought it ‘strange’ he would go to bed listening to BBC news and arts radio programmes The World Tonight and Kaleidoscope. He added there was barely a morning – ‘since I was aware of what was going on in the world’ – that he had not listened to Radio 4’s the Today programme. He also revealed himself to among the army of fans who have fallen in love with BBC4’s Danish drama series Borgen and The Killing. The BBC has faced continued pressure over its treatment of women on screen and notably those of older age. Research shows that men vastly outnumber female guests on its shows. There have also been accusations of ageism over the way in which Arlene Phillips was dropped as a judge from Strictly Come Dancing in favour of the much younger Alesha Dixon. Mr Entwistle’s predecessor Mark Thompson had admitted the broadcaster had a ‘case to answer’ over the lack of female presenters, especially in ‘iconic roles’. Interesting: Mr Entwistle revealed his thoughts on the BBC in an interview with the Radio Times . In his maiden speech to staff, Mr Entwistle vowed to improve the quality of BBC programmes. While highlighting the success of shows such as Luther, Sherlock, Call the Midwife, The Proms and the Great British Bake Off, he conceded that in some of its output the corporation settled for less than it should and said it was ‘time to admit to ourselves we can do better’. Mr Entwistle said while he would work on fixing the things that got in the way of ‘creative quality’ in return he wanted staff to question whether what they were producing was as remarkable and original as licence fee payers deserved. He warned: ‘I want everybody in the BBC to ask themselves this: am I using the extraordinary gift of public trust and public money to be original enough about the things I produce? Am I doing enough to challenge, lead, surprise and delight the people who pay for us?’ He said he would go to war on every bit of the BBC that was not ‘optimised’ for outstanding programming. Mr Entwistle told the Radio Times: ‘My hunch is that there isn’t a single bit of the BBC that, in places, can’t do better.’ He also warned staff that internal competition, duplication, and briefing against colleagues needed to be stamped out. Reform: The new director general said that he didn't think there was an area of the BBC that couldn't improve . Heralding a new era for the BBC, he said it needed to produce ‘genuinely digital content for the first time’ in an increasingly digital age. He also said the BBC should fight to keep some of its stars, but not by digging deeper into its wallet. Mr Entwistle also promised to take the BBC’s winning Olympic formula which ensured ratings success and make it work for other events. However he admitted that BSkyB was in a different league when it came to bidding for top sports rights. He said his corporation would maintain a ‘serious commitment’ to sport and wanted to build on the legacy of the London Olympics, including placing a new focus on women’s sport. But, he said the massively expensive deals for live football were now out of its reach. The BBC has already decided to split the live rights to Formula One with Sky and some analysts fear that more events will follow. BY PAUL REVOIR . The BBC’s top woman executive is to leave the corporation, it was announced yesterday. Caroline Thomson – who last year earned almost £330,000 as chief operating officer – had been expected to go after losing out to George Entwistle for the director- general’s job. The 58-year-old’s post is being axed and the division she ran is being dismantled. She first joined the BBC after starting as a trainee journalist in 1975 and was a key player in the licence fee settlements in 2007 and 2010. Caroline Thomson: The chief operating officer's post is being axed and her division dismantled . She will leave next week with a £1.71million pension pot and could get up to 12 months of redundancy pay. She is not planning to retire. Since the BBC began publishing the expenses claims of its top executives, her taxi claims have received attention with her regular use of cabs costing thousands of pounds of licence fee money each year. She said: ‘It has been an immense privilege to be part of the leadership of the BBC – the world’s best public service broadcaster. ‘Wonderful programmes, brilliant colleagues and a real sense of public purpose, what more could you ask? I wish George and his colleagues the best of luck as they take the BBC forward – I know it will be safe in their hands.’ Chief financial officer Zarin Patel is also leaving in the coming months . Mr Entwistle said: ‘I want to mark this moment by paying tribute to Caroline’s enormous contribution to the BBC over many years now. She was pivotal in winning the last charter for us, when her impeccable strategic leadership helped deliver a clearly defined ten-year mission for the BBC, securing our purposes and funding through to 2016.’ Chief financial officer Zarin Patel, who earned £337,000 last year, is also to leave in the coming months. She found herself at the centre of the row about the BBC’s payment of stars through personal service companies after she appeared in front of MPs about the issue. Insiders say it was known that Miss Patel had been looking for a new challenge and that Mr Entwistle was aware of this. The decision was said to have been mutual. But before she goes the finance chief will spend the next 12 months setting up a new finance and business division with the director-general.Miss Thomson, 58, is married to the former Blairite advisor Lord Liddle – her second husband – and has one son. She studied at Mary Datchelor Girls’ School, a grammar school in Camberwell,  South London, and the University of York. After first joining the BBC as a trainee journalist 30 years ago, she went on to produce radio and television programmes including Panorama. She left to work as political assistant to Roy Jenkins, then the leader of the SDP, during the 1983 general election campaign and joined Channel 4 the following year as a commissioning editor, later becoming head of corporate affairs.

"Pioneering patient: Fiona is taking part in a trial of photodynamic therapy . Fiona Fisher was diagnosed with breast cancer this summer and was astounded when her doctors suggested that their first move should be to try to kill the tumour by blasting it with a laser for 15 minutes. This involved injecting a drug into the tumour to make it sensitive to light. Then, via a needle, they shone an intensive laser beam into the cancer to kill it. 'The whole thing was less invasive than the biopsy that I had to confirm the diagnosis of cancer,' says Fiona, 57, a self-employed management consultant living in Primrose Hill, North London. While this may sound like the kind of story that has cancer doctors in despair at the gullibility of patients who fall for an expensive and unproven treatment, in fact Fiona is at the centre of one of the most carefully considered and authoritative - as well as potentially revolutionary - experiments in the field of breast cancer. Just eight weeks ago, Fiona became concerned when the top of her left breast felt thickened and granular. Within a fortnight, she'd become one of the first four patients - there will be 30 in all - being given photodynamic therapy (PDT) in the initial phase of a new trial at the Royal Free Hospital in North London. Photodynamic therapy was first pioneered as a cancer therapy in the UK 25 years ago, and is now approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as treatment of four cancers: the skin (though not melanoma), early or late cancers of head and neck, lung and oesophageal. 'It's an extraordinary treatment that cuts the cost and time involved, and means patients don't have to undergo other treatments that cause very unpleasant side-effects,' says David Longman, founder of the charity Killing Cancer. 'It's also quick; patients and their families know within a short period of time whether the cancer has been destroyed.' Until recently, the treatment had a major drawback: it stayed in the body for weeks, causing patients to be ultra-sensitive to ordinary light, and be unable to leave the house for weeks after treatment. What's made the current breast cancer trial possible is the introduction of new drugs that leave the body within 48 hours. As with all the trial participants, Fiona spent 48 hours after her treatment in a darkened room in a private ward of the Royal Free Hospital. 'It was a wonderful and quite luxurious rest,' she recalls. Experts predict that photodynamic therapy could eventually make the non-invasive treatment the norm for some types of breast cancer. In other words, a cure without the need for surgery. Light show: After a drug is injected into the tumour to make it sensitive to light, an intensive laser is beamed into the cancer to kill it . 'The beauty of this technology is that, if successful, it works without affecting the surrounding healthy tissue, leaving the breasts completely intact,' says Professor Mohammed Keshtgar, a breast cancer surgeon at the Royal Free who is leading the new research. This trial of photodynamic therapy is the first to test it for primary (newly diagnosed) breast cancer. The initial stage of the trial is 'a dose-escalating study' to discover the most effective combination dose of drugs and light, with the patients receiving an MRI scan before and after the treatment to gauge its impact on the tumour. As the treatment is unproven, the women in the trial have had to agree to undergo a full mastectomy afterwards: the trial cannot put the participants at any risk of their cancer returning. But the tissue removed during mastectomies will be analysed to check the effects of the photodynamic therapy. Which is why, just a couple of days after emerging from the Royal Free's private wing, Fiona returned to the NHS operating theatre at the hospital to have a full mastectomy, as well as a reconstruction of her left breast. And next week she will embark on chemotherapy and radiotherapy, followed by a course of hormone tablets. 'The beauty of this technology is that, . if successful, it works without affecting the surrounding healthy . tissue, leaving the breasts completely intact.' 'I may be getting no benefit myself, but to know my contribution might change the experience of breast cancer for women in the future makes it worthwhile,' she says. The Royal Free team is determined to discover the truth about photodynamic therapy in cancer treatment. While other centres, including University College London, have studied PDT, there's been a lack of properly funded, authoritative research. And Cancer Research UK also insists that the evidence is 'too patchy'. What's more, NICE's approval of photodynamic therapy for skin and oesophageal cancer comes with warnings that the evidence in favour of it is 'of poor quality', and that hospitals should consider this when deciding whether to use it. It's hoped the new trial will convince more people in the field to try PDT. 'Surgeons are largely comfortable with PDT because they are used to using equipment such as lasers,' says Dr Mahendra Deonarain, honorary reader in antibody technology and therapeutics at Imperial College London, and chief science officer at Photobiotics, a company pioneering more targeted ways of delivering the treatment. 'But cancer treatment today is decided by a multi-disciplinary team. It's difficult for these different specialties to communicate the benefits well enough to bring about a dramatic change in treatment.' The first phase of the three-stage Royal Free study is recruiting patients, but this should be completed within two years. The next phase will involve recruiting a larger group of women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer but refuse a mastectomy for personal reasons, or are unfit for surgery. Foregoing mastectomy: Fiona Fisher had a full mastectomy after taking part in the trial, but if it's proven to be effective, those undergoing photodynamic therapy will not need surgery . 'We will be asking them to undergo PDT without any further treatment - and then follow their progress over several months to discover whether the age of the patient and the sort and grade of the tumour affects the efficacy of the treatment - and compare the results with women treated conventionally,' says Professor Keshtgar. 'It's essential that we leave no room for doubt about the outcome of this trial. 'If it works, we want the treatment to be fully approved by NICE and to be widely available for breast cancer patients.' Dr Keyvan Moghissi, clinical director of the Yorkshire Laser Centre in Goole, East Yorkshire, says it's important that patients' expectations of the therapy are realistic. 'It's hugely effective for the right cancers, but it doesn't work for every patient,' says Dr Moghissi, who, as editor of the journal Photodiagnosis and Photodynamic Therapy, has overseen the publication of scores of papers on the treatment. More importantly, at the centre in East Yorkshire, he has been using PDT as a cancer treatment for over 20 years, but says he usually recommends the treatment for only around one in ten of patients. 'It doesn't work for many cancers such as leukaemia, and it's only successful when the tumour is very localised,' he says. 'What's more, often the best results are achieved when PDT is used alongside the conventional therapies: surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.' Yet such a view may change with the new study. So far, four women have received photodynamic therapy and MRI - and in at least some of these it seems the cancer has cleared completely. While Professor Keshtgar gives little away, he admits 'the whole team is feeling very encouraged' and that, aged 50, he hopes to see the introduction of photodynamic therapy for newly diagnosed breast cancer 'within my career lifetime'. But there is a long journey ahead. 'The purpose of the research at the moment is to get the dose right, not treat the tumour. But we are noting whether the tumour is visible in the second, post-treatment MRI scan and in the mastectomy tissue under the microscope. And there are hopeful signs.'

"Twitter is one of the most popular social networking sites in the world and has even become a favorite platform for terrorist groups like ISIS to spread propaganda in the hopes of recruiting fighters. A recent report compiled by a Brookings Institute fellow to be published next month by the Brooking's Institution identified up to 46,000 Twitter accounts that were operated by ISIS sympathizers last fall. Yahoo News reports that Congress will be writing a letter to twitter this week along with other social media sites such as YouTube and Facebook to tell them they need to develop a strategy for controlling terror groups online. 'This is the way [ISIS] is recruiting — they are getting people to leave their homelands and become fighters,' said Texas Congressman Ted Poe, the Republican chair of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, who held a recent hearing on the issue. Fighting online terrorism: Republican Ted Poe, a Republican from Texas, is at the forefront of the battle of online terrorism on social media sites like Twitter . Poe told Yahoo News that the US government will demand that Twitter actively shut down terrorist's profiles to prevent them from tweeting and recruiting people to commit violence. Poe has said 'there is frustration with Twitter specifically' about their lack of effectively shutting down pages that threaten violence. Congress hopes to treat online terror groups the same way they treat child pornography and noted Twitter was better about removing obscene images than they were about eliminating terror groups online. Twitter officials are arguing that they have just as stringent a policy as other social media outlets and those critics are ignoring their behind the scenes help to the FBI. 'Like our peer companies, we do not proactively monitor content,' a Twitter spokesman said in an email to Yahoo News. 'We review all reported content against our rules, which prohibit unlawful use and direct, specific threats of violence against others. Users report potential rules violations to us, we review their reports and take action if the content violates our rules,' it continued. Terrorists on Twitter: Oftentimes Twitter did not become aware of terrorists on their site until other Twitter users flagged the abuse online . J.M. Berger, the Brookings Institute fellow who conducted the recent social media study, suggested that Twitter's problems are of their own making. 'Twitter is notoriously close-mouthed in how they handle suspensions and what goes on in the company,' said Berger. 'We don’t know who they suspend, and why. Of all the social media companies, they have been very reluctant to be involved in discussions with the government, Berger continued. He then went on to say that the company's founders have 'libertarian views.' In the past Twitter has been criticized by White House staff such as Lisa Monaco, President Barack Obama’s chief counterterrorism adviser, who said that Twitter, ‘wouldn’t even return [White House officials’] phone calls.' A White House official said recently that Twitter will be sending representatives to the White House Summit this week but no Twitter executives will be speaking in any panels. Matt Olsen, the former director of the National Counterterrorism Center has called ISIS the 'most sophisticated propaganda machine; of any terror group. Yahoo News reports that ISIS on Twitter recruits young people and pushes them to commit lone wolf terrorism. The terror groups often use popular hashtags like #World Cup and #Ebola to expand their readership. Twitter has argued that they take their guidance from the FBI who instructed them to leave ISIS twitter's online. Call for violence: Twitter user Mujahid Miski who has had a total of 20 or more Twitter accounts because they kept getting deleted called upon Muslims to kill Jews . 'We’ll take them down when the FBI tells us to take them down,' Poe said Twitter officials have argued in the meetings he has had with them. FBI officials have also confirmed that they told Twitter to leave some profiles online so that they could identify potential terrorists. 'The risk of recruitment and incitement to violence outweighs the benefits from surveilling them and finding out who they are,' said former George W. Bush White House counterterrorism adviser Fran Townsend, who heads a private group called the Counter Extremism Project, said in an interview. An internal memo written by Twitter CEO Dick Costolo criticized his company's failure to shut down tweeters who engage in cyberbullying and sexual harassment on its network. 'We suck at dealing with abuse and trolls on the platform,' Costolo wrote in the memo. 'We’re going to start kicking these people off right and left and making sure that when they issue their ridiculous attacks, nobody hears them.' One ISIS member on Twitter by the name of Mujahid Miski (identified by court papers as Mohammed Abdullah Hassan) made over 20 accounts after they kept getting shut down. One of his tweets read,' Allahu Akbar, 5 Jews were sent to hell by two brave Muslims. Allahu Akbar, if only every Muslims could kill 1 Jew, everything would change.' Miski has boasted on Twitter that by slightly changing the name on his account he can make a new Twitter. 'My view is that we can kick them off, but it’s not going to solve the issue,' said Quinten Wiktorowicz, a former White House national security adviser under Obama who specialized in countering-violent-extremism issues. 'It really is playing whack-a-mole.' The solution, say officials, is to form a union between U.S. officials and social media pages to counter propaganda with other messages .","A recent report compiled by the Brookings Institute identified up to 46,000 Twitter accounts that were operated by ISIS sympathizers .

"Hundreds of women may have had their fertility put in jeopardy after reports that a popular contraceptive implant could get 'lost' in their bodies. The problem with the Implanon device could also force hundreds more to delay their dreams of motherhood. The implant, which is used by hundreds of thousands of women in the UK, is the size of a matchstick and is inserted under the skin of the upper arm, in a procedure that needs to be carried out by a trained doctor. After use, the device is meant to be removed. It can also be taken out of the body sooner if the woman desires to try and get pregnant, or for health reasons. But according to the Medicines and Healthcare . Regulatory Agency – the Government’s drugs and medical devices . watchdog, dozens of cases have been reported where the implant moved from its original location. The Implanon implants slowly release a hormone into the bloodstream which gives contraceptive protection for three years . Plus a number of worried women have . revealed on online forums that doctors have been unable to locate their . implants - raising fears they may never be able to conceive. Over three years Implanon releases the hormone progesterone into the blood, which stops the ovaries from releasing eggs and makes the . womb less receptive. The rod, which is made from a biodegradable synthetic material, is supposed to be easily implanted and removed. However, figures released to Mail Online have revealed that up til August 2012, a total of 2,314 . spontaneous suspected adverse drug reactions had been reported . associated with Implanon and its successor Nexplanon. This included 36 spontaneous . reactions of devices moving from their original site. There were five reported cases of . infertility where the Implanon device could not be located for removal and the MHRA added the numbers could be far higher due to under-reporting. A number of worried women have posted their problems with the device on online forums. A forum user called Claire T, posted on Netmums: 'Has anyone else had a problem with their implanon going missing? 'I . went to have mine removed 5 months ago but the doctor couldnt feel where . it was so sent me for an ultrasound which didn't find it so i am now . waiting for an MRI scan to see if that picks it up. 'I'm so worried it will never be found!' Kelly W replied she had the device in for 18 months. Adding: 'When I had it out it had moved an inch up my arm from the original scar. 'The doctor said that it was really odd because fatty tissue keeps it . where its inserted almost instantly. He really was shocked.' Problems: A number of women say they have become pregnant despite having the implant . Licensed in 1999, Implanon has become a ­popular form of ­contraception, with around 800,000 women using it, according to Department of Health estimates. The £90 device is a flexible rod the size of a matchstick that is inserted under the skin of the upper arm. It gradually releases the hormone progesterone which stops the ovaries from releasing eggs and makes the womb less receptive to fertilised eggs. It provides protection against pregnancy for up to three years and properly inserted it is 99.95 per cent effective among all users, compared with 99.7 per cent for the Pill. But investigations showed in some cases the implant was not released from the pre-loaded applicator and never inserted into the arm of the patient. In other women it was delivered too deep to work properly. One in four women who go to family planning clinics get long-term contraceptive implants. They are especially popular with teenagers, with 10 per cent of 16 to 19-year-olds saying they prefer an implant because they do not have to remember to take a pill.Around 80,000 women use implants of the same type as Implanon. Meanwhile Nici Davies, 37, from London, was . offered the implant in 2010 and said she was told it could easily be . removed when she wanted children. However, when she requested it be . taken out this April she said three different doctors failed to find the . device. She is awaiting a scan but has been warned the device may never . be found. She told The Sun: 'The implant can last five years. I am left with no chance of having children.' She added: 'Why do they push implants for older women if they know this can happen?' Implanon’s . manufacturer MSD, a subsidiary of global pharmaceutical giant Merck, . replaced Implanon in 2010 with an updated product called Nexplanon, . which has a . new pre-loaded applicator and contains barium so it can be better . detected. However, it has not recalled the existing stock of Implanon, meaning women are still being given it. In a statement the MHRA said: 'Rare . cases of migration with Implanon and the difficulty of removal was one . of the key reasons for developing a radio-opaque version of Implanon, . called Nexplanon. 'Nexplanon was introduced in the UK . in 2010 and can be identified using X-ray or CT scan in the rare cases . that it cannot easily be located in the usual way. 'As with all medicines, the MHRA will continue to monitor the benefits and risks of Implanon and Nexplanon. We would advise anyone with questions about their contraceptive implant to speak to their GP.' It is the latest setback for the . contraceptive method, which is manufactured by Merck, after data from 2011 revealed almost 600 women using the device . found they still became pregnant. Despite this, the Department of Health has advised there is no cause for concern with the devices. They said no form of contraceptive is 100 per cent effective and anyone with concerns should visit their GP. The device is just over an inch long and doesn't show up under X-rays . The MHRA said there had been reports of problems with inserting and removing Implanon. However, it advises that women who can feel their implant and within the three-year timeframe do not need to take any action. Lynn . Hearton Helpline and Information Services Manager the sexual health charity FPA . said: 'It’s . highly unlikely that implants migrate around the body. But very occasionally . they’re fitted too deeply. 'There are specially trained doctors who can take . them out. Women who’ve got an implant can be easily reassured it's still in . place by feeling it under their skin. If they can’t they should get it checked . out or phone us for advice.' A spokesman for Implanon's U.S manufacturer Merck, said 'On the rare occasion that the implant cannot be located by the doctor or nurse feeling for the implant prior to its removal, there are various methods which can be used to help locate the implant such as ultra-sound scanning and MRI. 'Unlike Implanon, Nexplanon contains barium sulphate which means that it can be detected by x-ray and CT in addition to ultra-sound and MRI. 'We would always advise women to contact their healthcare professional or call the implant helpline number on the user card given to women when they have the implant inserted.'","Implanon device contains a progesterone-like hormone that is released slowly into the bloodstream .

"Famed thrill-seeking surfer Laird Hamilton helped rescue a man who was caught fighting for his life in historically powerful waves off the Malibu coast on Wednesday. Hamilton, a big-wave chaser known for taking on the world's largest breakers, was at the surf mecca to experience the 20 foot waves kicked up by Hurricane Marie circling miles offshore. Unfortunately, so was the inexperienced surfer he ended up rescuing after the man lost his board and was swept dangerously close to rocks. Scroll down for video . Tropical storm Marie, off the west coast of Baja California, brought big surf to southern California beaches on Tuesday and Wednesday. The big wave swell prompted surfers and onlookers to south facing beaches like The Wedge in Newport Beach . Several hundred people gathered to watch body surfers, body boarders and surfers to get the perfect ride on Wednesday for what would be the biggest wave of this late summer swell . Surfers enjoy a second day of 20-25 foot waves at the Wedge, Newport Beach. Big Surf from Hurricane Marie hit Southern California on Wednesday . One surfer battles through the monstrous waves on the southern California beach. At least 60 surfers had to be rescued from the waves which reached up to 30ft . Hero: Famed extreme surfer Laird Hamilton (right) helped rescue a man struggling against dangerously high waves in Malibu on Wednesday . A fellow daredevil assisted Hamilton as he towed the stranded man in. 'Oh, he was happy, he was thankful,' Hamilton told KABC. 'His eyes were big and he was appreciative that he was back on the land.' Despite the danger, surfers, body-boarders and body-surfers flocked to favorite spots such as the notorious Wedge at Newport Beach, where the interaction of swells and a jetty produced huge waves, and cars were backed up for miles along the only road to the narrow peninsula. Big crowds watched surfers in the morning, while bodysurfers took on the surf in the afternoon. Among them was Joshua Magner, 35, who has been surfing since he was 10, and said being in the water in Wednesday's waves was life-altering. 'It's like being born,' he said as he zipped his wetsuit and prepared to go back out. 'You don't know what the outcome will be, but when you do make it through all that pressure is alleviated, it's liberation, truly the feeling of liberation.' Photo moment: Gerard Butler takes pictures of the massive waves at Surf-rider Beach in Malibu (right) before chatting with some beach friends (left).  The Scottish actor portrayed a surfer Frosty Hesson in the 2012 film Chasing Mavericks . Asked if he was afraid, he replied, 'I was scared leaving my house. Dude, I was scared last night. I couldn't sleep.' Some gawkers had to park nearly two miles away and walk to the scene. One man rode a skateboard, carrying a baby. A man put a sign on his car offering his parking space for cash and another was selling commemorative T-shirts for $20 apiece. Scottish actor Gerard Butler, 44, watched the big waves roll in at Surfrider Beach in Malibu. The star played surfer Frosty Hesson in the 2012 biopic Chasing Mavericks about surfer Jay Moriarity. Lifeguards up and down the coast sought to keep anyone out of the water who did not have strong experience and were kept busy making rescues all day. In Malibu, a surfer died a day earlier after being pulled from the water but it was not clear whether the death was related to the surf or a medical condition. There were 60 rescues Wednesday in the area. Residents of about four blocks of homes along Seal Beach, south of Los Angeles, swept seawater from ground-floor rooms after flooding overnight, and bulldozers reinforced a 6-foot-tall sand berm hastily built to protect shoreline structures. The berm - a measure normally not needed until winter storms - and the use of pumps prevented more water intrusion during the morning high tide, and another test was expected close to midnight. An unknown surfer is rescued by Newport Beach lifeguards after wiping out on a giant wave. After several attempts to get him to shore failed the lifeguards swam him out to a waiting boat just outside the lineup . The towering waves and rip currents were being produced by swells generated by Hurricane Marie in the Pacific Ocean about 800 miles west of the southern tip of Mexico's Baja California peninsula. While Hurricane-generated waves reached California's shores, the storm itself would remain far from the state. Marie will likely weaken to tropical storm levels, but life-threatening water conditions were expected to continue through Thursday. Two cargo terminals at the Port of Long Beach stopped operations late Tuesday because surging, 10- to 15-foot-high waves endangered dockworkers. The powerful surge also tossed heavy rocks from a seawall onto a road, causing damage and closing the roadway. On Santa Catalina Island south of Los Angeles, a heavy surge Tuesday night sent sand, water and some 3,000-pound rocks into a boatyard, causing substantial damage and tossing some dry-docked boats off their stands, Avalon Harbor Master Brian Bray said. A surfer separates from his board at the legendary California surf spot The Wedge which was experiencing the biggest waves in decades over the past two days . Huge 20-25 foot waves hit the Balboa pier, Newport Beach. Hurricane Marie has made for wild surfing conditions but has led to some narrow escapes for those more inexperienced . The surge also tore away a floating children's swim platform and closed several docks to incoming traffic. Along the shoreline in Seal Beach, firefighters went door to door, dropping off more sandbags for residents and surveying damage after the initial surge late Tuesday that topped a 2 1/2 foot beach wall, causing flooding in or around the first row of homes. About 100 residences were affected, Orange County Fire Authority Capt. Steve Concialdi said. 'This is our worst summer storm, and I've been here 42 years,' said resident Jerry Rootlieb, who was sweeping out his home Wednesday. Jaime and Blanca Brown's seaside home had a foot of seawater throughout the home, garage and carport. Soaked floor tiles in the hallway were buckled, and a dirty line marked the high point of water in almost every room and the garage. Sodden mattresses and carpets were stacked outside. 'What can you do, man? We are just trying to win the war, and we're just bringing out water. Water, water, water,' said the Browns' nephew, Hector Brown. The Malibu Pier was closed after pilings were knocked loose. The pier's structural integrity remained sound because of redundancy but people were asked to stay away, State Parks Department official Craig Sap he said.","Laird Hamilton plucked the inexperienced surfer out of the chilly Pacific early on Wednesday morning .

"For nearly half a century, his medals simply gathered dust in a locked drawer. Branse Burbridge rarely talked about his adventures as an RAF ace in the Second World War, not even with his closest family. But the medals told their own remarkable story. One was a Distinguished Flying Cross and Bar, for his acts of gallantry in the face of the enemy. Another was the Distinguished Service Order and Bar, for an ‘outstanding’ devotion to duty. Wing Commander Bransome 'Branse' Burbridge was the RAF's most prolific night-fighter pilot of the war, claiming 21 enemy kills.

RAF log book recorded 21 enemy kills, more than any other pilot flying . night-time missions. But whenever he could, he aimed for the enemy . plane’s engine to give the pilot and crew a chance of survival. Devoted husband: 'Branse' with his wife Barbara, who died last year .

Burbridge (right) and his navigator Bill Skelton (left) made 30 sorties over Germany to provide escort cover to RAF bombers . He downed four German planes in a . single sortie and saved countless lives by bringing down three V1 flying bombs, jet propelled aeroplanes, before they hit civilian communities in London. But time appears . to have evaporated the nation’s debt to Branse Burbridge, now 92 and . suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. With much reluctance, his family is . being forced to sell the medals to pay care home fees. Yesterday veterans’ organisations . blamed politicians for forgetting the risks Wing Commander Burbridge and . his contemporaries took and the sacrifices they made. One described it . as ‘a kick in the teeth’ and added: ‘Sadly he won’t be the last to have . to sell his medals to pay for his care.’ The story of how a young bible-class . teacher became an unlikely fighter ace began when Burbridge, who . registered as a conscientious objector at the outbreak of war, decided . the best way to serve God was to fight for his country against the evil . of Nazism. He signed up for the RAF shortly after . turning 20 in February 1941 and was posted nine months later to 85 . Squadron as a night-fighter pilot. The air ace flew Mosquitos with 85 Squadron and his first enemy kill was in February 1944 when he shot down a Messerschmitt 410 fighter plane off the Sussex coast.

Burbridge shot down three Junkers 88 bombers and a Messerschmitt 110 near Bonn, firing just 200 rounds in the process . David Erskine-Hill, of London auctioneers Dix Noonan Webb, which is selling the medal group, said: 'The Second World War produced many modest heroes who returned to civilian life and were reluctant to discuss their war-time exploits' Flying a Mosquito, the dashing young . pilot excelled. With his navigator Bill Skelton he formed a duo . nicknamed ‘the night hawk partners’ – and shot down 21 aircraft in ten . months. The pair made 30 sorties over Germany to provide cover for British and Allied bombers. One of his most exciting scrapes came . on the night of March 24, 1944, when he became embroiled in a dogfight . with a Dornier 217 bomber over the Channel. His Mosquito chased the . aircraft from 19,000ft to 3,000ft before it crashed into the sea. Burbridge pulled up with only 1,000ft to spare. His most celebrated achievement came . in November 1944 during a bombing raid over Berlin. With just 200 . rounds, he shot down three Junkers 88 bombers and a Messerschmitt. In .

Burbridge’s resolve to target aircraft . engines rather than pilots meant that after the war, he was able to . meet his chief adversary, Major Wilhelm Herget, whose plane he had . downed. Burbridge happily took him for a spin in a Mosquito. But not long afterwards, Wing . Commander Burbridge put the war behind him. He studied theology at . Oxford and became a lay preacher, dedicating much of his life to helping . young people. Soon after his wife Barbara died last . year, however, it became clear his family would face a hefty bill for . his care. Now they are trying to raise £120,000 from the sale of his . medals, enough to provide for up to six years’ care at the ‘brilliant’ home where he lives. Yesterday his son Paul, a 59-year-old artistic . director from York, said: ‘We’re reluctant to do it but we believe it is . the right thing. He was happy to do the remarkable things he did and he . survived. We value him more than his medals. ‘My father never really talked about . his war experiences very much. It was only when my own son became . interested for a school project that we sat down with Dad, and he took . us through his log book.’ Recently Burbridge’s life was . documented in a book, Wings and a Prayer. Author Gillian Warson said: . ‘He was extremely modest about the whole thing. He never understood why . he had been rewarded for something he didn’t really want to do. He . didn’t boast about it... just the opposite.

"Campaigners claiming to be part of the hacking protest group Anonymous have published contact details of senior English Defence League members online after posting a video vowing to bring down the organisation, it has been reported. In a video posted on YouTube, the group condemns the EDL for using the death of Drummer Lee Rigby as 'another excuse to further spread your campaign of hate, bigotry, and misinformation' before announcing 'Operation EDL'. Drummer Rigby was hacked to death near Woolwich barracks in south-east London last Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Attack: Protesters claiming to be part of hacking group Anonymous posted this video on YouTube promising to bring down the English Defence League before apparently publishing contact details of members online . A list of what were said to be mobile phone numbers for senior named EDL figures were published online yesterday evening along with addresses of what were said to be donors to the group, the Guardian reported. Leaked details of hundreds of names and addresses linked to the far-right group that were circulated on the internet in 2010 after hackers broke into one of the organisation's websites were also re-published online yesterday. One member, Glen Warren, says he has been fielding several calls from 'anti-fascists and Muslims' after his mobile number was published. He told MailOnline: 'I've had so many people ringing up and threatening me, threatening to rape my mum and kill me. 'It's childish. I'm not even going to go to the police. I spoke to them like an adult.' The 32-year-old, from Leicester, denied that the group was using Drummer Rigby's death to incite hatred of Islam. Aggressive: About 1,000 protesters joined an EDL march to Downing Street on Monday, chanting 'Muslim killers off our streets' and 'There's only one Lee Rigby' in tribute to the soldier killed in Woolwich last week . Vitriol: The group condemns the EDL for using the death of Drummer Lee Rigby as an 'another excuse to further spread your campaign of hate, bigotry and misinformation' He said: 'It's about Muslim extremism. You can't go round beheading people. I think that's why people are getting p***** off. 'I don't class every Muslim the same so why do people class every EDL member the same?' The video was posted by IWill Object under the title 'A Message from Anonymous UK to the English Defence League'. The message says: 'We have been . patiently observing your organisation, as you have inflated, . indoctrinating our young with your criminal mindset.' It then describes the EDL as a 'pack of . raving ignoramuses' before adding: 'Under the guise of national pride, . you have instigated crimes against the innocent and incited the . subjugation of Muslims. 'We will not allow your injustices, your lies and your stupidity to further radicalise our youth into fearing and despising their fellow man.' The warning concludes: 'In this operation, we will begin the systematic and comprehensive decimation of your cult. 'We . will further expose your falsities and your attempts to censor, to your . members, to the British public and to the world as a whole. 'You will fall. We can say this with complete confidence.' Victim: Drummer Lee Rigby was hacked to death near Woolwich barracks in London last Wednesday . About 1,000 protesters joined an EDL march to Downing Street on Monday, chanting 'Muslim killers off our streets' and 'There's only one Lee Rigby' in tribute to the soldier killed in Woolwich last week. Four men have since the protest been charged with various offences. A massive police presence kept the demonstrators apart from a smaller group of anti-fascist activists, with officers making 13 arrests in total. Meanwhile, a group of Muslims have been praised by the Archbishop of York for 'disarming extremist views' after serving tea and biscuits to EDL supporters who protested outside their mosque. Around six people linked to the far-right group staged a demonstration outside the mosque in Bull Lane, York, on Sunday. More than 100 members of the mosque had gathered on the premises after learning of the planned protest and invited the group inside to play football with worshippers and have refreshments. Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu told the BBC: 'Tea, biscuits and football are a great and a typically Yorkshire combination when it comes to disarming hostile and extremist views.' Imam Abid Salik described the incident as a 'really beautiful thing'.","Campaigners post video condemning EDL for 'spreading hate and bigotry'

"Children as young as 12 are being given contraceptive implants. At least five Scottish health boards have given long-term birth control to girls who are barely out of primary school. The schoolgirls are among almost 3,500 minors to have had the slow-release devices inserted in their arms – many without their parents’ knowledge, even though they are under the age of consent – since 2010. The drug has never been tested on children and is known to have side effects in some adults including nausea, depression, acne and headaches. Scroll down for video . Children as young as 12 are being given contraceptive implants. The schoolgirls are among 3,500 minors in Scotland to have the long-term birth control devices inserted in their arms . According to the manufacturer, the drug’s ‘safety and efficacy in adolescents under the age of 18 has not been established’. Norman Wells of the Family Education Trust said: ‘To provide schoolgirls with long-acting reversible contraception is to play with fire. ‘It is effectively giving them a licence to engage in illegal sexual activity and denies them the protection that the law on the age of consent is intended to give. 'Not only does prescribing the drugs to underage girls make it more difficult for them to resist sexual pressure from their peers, but it also makes them more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation by older sexual predators.’ Mr Wells added: ‘The fact that the safety of these implants has not been established for girls under the age of 18 means health professionals are taking a massive risk with the immediate and long-term health of these youngsters. ‘It is deeply disturbing that parents are frequently left in the dark and know nothing about the high-stakes gamble being taken on the physical and emotional well-being of their daughters.’ Patricia McKeever, editor of the Catholic Truth newsletter, condemned the practise, saying: ‘This is child abuse. I am not a medical person but it cannot possibly be helpful. Parents need to be more vigilant – you cannot trust the state with your children. ‘It is hypocritical of the Government to say they want to protect children from abuse in the home and then at the same time they are setting them up to be abused.’ The plastic implants – brand name Nexplanon – are fitted under the skin of the arm and last for three years, releasing progesterone to prevent pregnancy. In Scotland, contraceptive implants are available from hospitals or sexual health clinics and can be inserted by a nurse or a doctor. But the implants’ ‘safety and efficacy in adolescents under the age of 18 have not been established’, according to the manufacturer, healthcare giant MSD. The drug has never been tested on children and is known to have side effects in some adults including nausea, depression, acne and headaches . Health boards across Scotland have prescribed 3,562 of the implants to under-16s since 2010, figures released under Freedom of Information laws show. Greater Glasgow andClyde has fitted 1,523, Grampian 397, Ayrshire & Arran 382, Lanarkshire 291 and Borders 131. Between them, they admitted having given prescriptions to at least 20 12-year-olds. The figures are likely to be higher, though, as five boards – including NHS Lothian – refused to provide full details. The statistics also caused concern because – at the company’s own admission – the treatment’s safety in under-16s has not been established. In adults, side-effects are known to be common. Tory health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: ‘When we offer medication such as this to children, we have to be sure it is safe. ‘If these concerns prove to be legitimate, I hope the Scottish Government will look at this as a matter of urgency.’ Asked if the firm recommended its product for under-16s, an MSD spokesman said: ‘The choice and suitability of a contraceptive method for any individual should always be discussed with an appropriate healthcare professional.’ A Scottish Government spokesman said: ‘NHS boards and local authorities prioritise sexual health for young people and, as a result, teenage pregnancy rates have fallen for the last four years. ‘Whilst we would encourage any young person considering contraception to discuss this with their parent, there is no legal requirement to do so. ‘Decisions on prescribing of medicines are matters for clinicians in discussion with their patients. Clinicians will have access to all available information about the product.’ Nexplanon became available on the NHS in 2010. Its forerunner, Implanon, attracted controversy when it was disclosed that hundreds of women in England became pregnant while using it. NHS chiefs there paid £200,000 to those who had children or were hurt during the implants process.

"CVS and Rite Aid have joined a long list of the world's largest retailers who will not be accepting Apple Pay. At its launch, Apple boasted there are 200,000 retail stores now ready and willing to let you give them your cash using just a flick of your iPhone and a tap of your finger to prove your identity. But retail giants Walmart, Target, Kohl's. Dunkin' Donuts are not among them. These retail giants and dozens more are part of a group developing their own mobile payment scheme. Scroll down for video . Dead on arrival? CVS stores, along with rival Rite Aid, have joined a long list of retailers that simply won't be accepting Apple Pay . The Merchant Customer Exchange, a consortium of retailers creating their own mobile payment app, includes dozens of companies, many of which are among America's largest retailers: . Best Buy, Lowe's, Kmart, Kohl's, Dunkin' Donuts, Gap, Sam's, Walmart, Target, Wendy's, 7-Eleven, Exxon, Publix, Shell, Sheetz, Shop-Rite, Conoco, Wawa, Dick's, Olive Garden and more. It comes after the system hit several glitches following its launch last week. Some Apple Pay users in the US have been double-charged for purchases. The Californian tech giant has admitted there is a problem with its mobile payment system, but says it only affected ‘a very small number’ of Apple Pay users with Bank of America accounts, and is working to refund all faulty transactions. CVS and Rite Aid initially accepted Apple Pay, but quickly turned heel and no longer take the payment system. The chains disabled the system in their stores over the weekend, reports the New York Times. The retailer group to which both companies belong, the Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX), is creating CurrentC--a system similar to Apple Pay that will be owned by a consortium of retailers rather than a third party, i.e. Apple. Like Apple Pay, CurrentC allows consumers to quickly and securely pay for goods and services with the aid of an app on their cell phones. Obstacles: Apple Pay lets users pay with their phones at some 200,000 retail stores. Consumers may use whatever credit cards they'd like. While the system appears seamless, retailer opposition is a serious hurdle for the Silicon Valley giant . Apple Pay is compatible with the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus and the Apple Watch. The mobile system works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. This confirms the person's identity, and the payment is simply made as if the user had presented and signed their card. All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely. If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service. CurrentC, however, appears to work in an opposite way from Apple Pay. While the former uses what's called an NFC chip, which is scanned by the retail kiosk, the MCX system has the phone scan a code generated by the kiosk. Not only is CurrentC hoping to leave Apple out in the cold, it's trying to circumvent credit cards completely. While Apple Pay allows users to store whatever credit cards they'd like in their phones, CurrentC taps directly into the user's bank account. Results, though, are the same: a seamless and safe purchasing process. CurrentC is set to hit smartphones in 2015. Apple said it had found most retailers were enthusiastic. 'The feedback we are getting from customers and retailers about Apple Pay is overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic,' it told MailOnline. 'We are working to get as many merchants as possible to support this convenient, secure and private payment option for consumers. 'Many retailers have already seen the benefits and are delighting their customers at over 220,000 locations. Apple Pay (screenshots pictured above) stores Visa, MasterCard and American Express credit card information and works with the iPhone 6's touch ID fingerprint recognition system so users can touch their phone on a contactless reader to pay for goods. Stores such as McDonalds, Macy's and Walgreensare involved . And that may be Apple's one advantage, it's pay system is already here. Apple Pay made its debut last week. Now you can flash your new iPhone in the checkout line to pay for food, clothing and other goods. There's no need to pull out your credit card. But don't leave your wallet or purse behind quite yet: Despite a few dozen retail chains pledging support for Apple Pay, so-called contactless payments are still new. Smaller merchants, in particular, aren't likely to have the necessary equipment right away. All told, there are more than 200,000 payment terminals that should accept Apple Pay in the U.S. Apple has announced about two dozen leading retail chains accepting Apple Pay at launch, and others are planning to do so by the end of the year. Apple said it has worked with several retailers to make sure most of their stores, if not all of them, were ready at Monday's launch: Aeropostale, American Eagle Outfitters, Babies R Us, BJ's Wholesale Club, Bloomingdale's, Champs Sports, Chevron and Texaco retail stores including ExtraMile, Disney Store, Duane Reade, Footaction, Foot Locker, House of Hoops by Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, Macy's, McDonald's, Nike, Office Depot, Panera Bread, Petco, RadioShack, RUN by Foot Locker, SIX:02, Sports Authority, Subway, Toys R Us, Unleashed by Petco, Walgreens, Wegmans and Whole Foods Market. Bright side: Dozens of retailers will be accepting Apple Pay, the biggest of which include Subway, Whole Fooods, Walgreens, McDonald's and Macy's . Apple also said that the following merchants plan to add support by the end of the year: Anthropologie, Free People, Sephora, Staples, Urban Outfitters and Walt Disney Parks and Resorts. For online payments, Apple said the following merchants have apps ready for Apple Pay: Chairish, Fancy, Groupon, HotelTonight, Houzz, Instacart, Lyft, OpenTable, Panera Bread, Spring, Staples, Target and Uber. Others expected by year's end include: Airbnb, Disney Store, Eventbrite, JackThreads, Levi's Stadium by VenueNext, Sephora, Starbucks, StubHub, Ticketmaster and Tickets.com. Of course, Apple's retail stores and the Apple Store app will also take Apple Pay. Apple Pay is designed to protect the user's personal information. It doesn't collect any transaction information that can be tied back to a user and payment transactions are between the user, the merchant and the user's bank. Apple doesn't collect its users' purchase history, so when they are shopping in a store or restaurant it doesn't know what they bought, where they bought it or how much they paid for it. Card numbers are not stored on the device, instead, a unique Device Account Number is created, encrypted and stored in the Secure Element of the device. The Device Account Number in the Secure Element is walled off from iOS and not backed up to iCloud. Users can make purchases in stores and within apps, with credit cards issued by many US banks , which make up 83 percent of the credit card purchase volume in the country. The mobile system works by holding phone up to a generic card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. The NFC chip is fitted across the top of the phone. All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely. It uses the Passbook app and cards that are already on file with iTunes can be saved to it. Users can also take a picture of their own credit card and add it to the account. This is verified by the card's bank before being accepted. If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service. This won't cancel the cards, either, because the card details themselves are not stored on that device. Apple said it is 'working hard' on bringing it to the UK, although a date has yet to be announced .","Apple's mobile payment system is not being accepted at the drug store chains .

"Sister Wives patriarch Kody Brown's legal wife, Meri, has set the record straight about their divorce bombshell, revealing that she was the one who decided to call it quits - at least in the eyes of the law. News of Kody and Meri Brown's separation stunned the fans of the long-running TLC reality TV show about a polygamist family living with their 17 children in Lehi, Utah. Kody Brown confirmed earlier this month that in the fall of 2014, he quietly divorced Meri, 44, his first and only legal wife, and officially married his fourth 'spiritual' wife, 36-year-old Robyn. Scroll down for videos . Big reveal: Meri Brown, one of the stars of the TLC reality show Sister Wives, revealed in a preview promoting the upcoming finale of season 5 that she was the one who decided to divorce Kody Brown . Moment of truth: The promo shows Meri Brown signing the divorce papers last fall . Following the announcement, the Brown family released a statement to the media saying that they made the decision to ‘legally restructure’ their family together. But in a dramatic preview promoting the show's season 5 finale, which is scheduled to air March 1 at 8pm Eastern Time, Meri Brown tearfully tells the other sister wives, 'I am divorcing Kody.' The 40-second sneak-peak video also shows a visibly distraught Meri signing the divorce papers. ‘The word “divorce” is like shattering glass,’ Kody says in the promo. Kody Brown tied the knot with Robyn, the youngest of his wives, just months after his divorce from Meri was finalized. The newlyweds continue to share their home with Kody's two other spiritual spouses, Christine, 42, and 45-year-old Janelle. ‘In the season finale, additional details emerge that add clarity to Meri’s decision to divorce Kody and the family’s decision to take the additional step of Robyn marrying Kody,’ TLC said in a statement to Us Weekly. Reshuffled: Kody Brown divorced the youngest of his four wives, 36-year-old Robyn (left), just months after divorcing his first and only legal spouse, 44-year-old Meri (right) ‘The word “divorce” is like shattering glass,’ Kody says in the promo . The final episode of the season on TLC will be followed by a tell-all interview with the stars of the show, including Meri Brown, with Today Show co-host Tamrin Hall acting as the moderator. On Monday, TLC announced that Sister Wives has been picked up for season 6, which will air sometime in the fall of 2015. When the divorce became public knowledge, it was described as a legal maneuver that will allow Kody Brown to give Robyn's three children from a past relationship - Dayton, Aurora and Breanna - access to insurance and other benefits. Kody Brown is marrying Robyn legally to offer more stability to her three children from her first marriage. They are pictured here in 2010, before the couple's son Solomon was born . Kody Brown appears to live in marital bliss with his four 'wives' Meri (second from left), Janelle (far right), Christine (second from right) and Robyn (far left)  on TLC's Sister Wives . The extended Brown family last year: Kody holds son Solomon, his biological child with Robyn. Fourth wife Robyn is in the black dress at back. First wife Meri is in green and white. The four wives have 17 children . Kody was only legally wed to Meri after their wedding in 1990, while the the next three were 'sister' marriages. Kody has never been officially married to his middle wives, Janelle and Christine. And within just three months of his divorce with Meri, he had tied the knot with  wife Robyn, the youngest and most recent addition to the group. Meri has decided to stay with Kody and his polygamist family as a spiritual wife. According to records, the 44-year-old family head and his wife of 20 years jointly petitioned for divorce which was finalized on September 25, 2014. It is believed that Kody wanted to bring Robyn's three kids from a previous marriage better into the family, where they'll have more security. She has a son Dayton and two daughters, Breanna and Aurora, from her first marriage, and her fourth child, son Solomon, is her only biological son with Kody. On the show, all of Robyn's children refer to Kody as 'dad' and are referred to as Kody's children. Their biological father is alive and Robyn is divorced from him. On one episode of the show she tearfully revealed she as left the marriage and was driven to financial ruin getting out of it it. She also revealed her first child, Dayton, 15, was conceived out of wedlock despite her strong conservative beliefs. She then married his father and they had two more kids before divorcing.

After Meri Kody married Janelle, left, and Christine, pictured right. Neither wedding was ever legal . Solomon was born at home in Robyn and Kody's Las Vegas bedroom in 2011, a year after the couple wed in Utah. As a Christmas present for Kody in 2013, Robyn legally changed her name to Robyn Brown from Robyn Sullivan. The Brown family now lives in four neighboring homes, custom built, in a cul-de-sac in Las Vegas. Kody wed his first three wives in quick succession. He and Meri legally and spiritually wed in 1990, he and Janelle spiritually wed in 1993 and he and Christine were married in 1994. None of the children by his first three wives remember a time when their other two 'moms' were not part of the family. He has one child with Meri and six with Janelle and six and with Christine. After a long period with no new wives, there was obvious friction, captured by the television cameras on the first season of Sister Wives, when Kody decided to court and then marry Robyn, bringing her and her three children into the already bursting household. But no wife was more supportive than Meri, who also is the closest to Robyn. Meri, who struggled with fertility and only has one biological child, made no secret of always yearning for more children in the family. She encouraged Kody to court Robyn. The whole family isn't just married, they also work together for their online business, My Sister Wives Closet, which sells jewelry and knickknacks. Within three months of divorcing Meri (left) he had married the youngest of his four 'spiritual wives' Robyn (right) Some fans have expressed shock and sympathy for Meri online, but the decision is more likely to be legal maneuver due to the fact that it is still illegal to officially be married to more than one person. Kody and his wives first appeared in Sister Wives in 2010 and said at the time they hoped the show to make the public more aware of polygamist families and to combat societal prejudices. All his wives except Janelle were raised in polygamist families. But, Janelle's mother went on to become a polygamist after her daughter, and is now in a plural marriage with Kody's dad . The series led to the Brown family being investigated for possible prosecution although Kody believes his polygamist arrangement is legal because he is legally married only to one woman, and the other marriages are spiritual unions. The Brown family belongs to the Apostolic United Brethren- a polygamous Mormon fundamentalist church within the Latter Day Saint movement. No word yet if the divorce and new legal marriage will feature on future episodes of the family's TLC show. Meri encouraged Kody's courtship of and marriage to his fourth wife Robyn. Here, a still from their wedding reception which aired on TLC's SIster Wives. The ceremony itself was 'too sacred' for television .","Kody Brown stars in TLC's Sister Wives with his four 'wives' and children, but only his marriage to first wife Meri was legal .

"Global warming is a ‘public health emergency’ that will cause thousands of deaths worldwide, a leading medical journal warns. The BMJ claims that the ‘mayhem’ it will inflict on future generations will make deaths from the ebola outbreak ‘pale into insignificance’. In a bizarre move, the journal has set aside 11 pages of this week’s issue to warn doctors of the dire consequences of global warming – without any obvious relevance to medicine. Global warming is a ‘public health emergency’ that will cause thousands of deaths worldwide, leading medical journal BMJ warns; above a chunk of ice breaks away from the Antarctic ice shelf because of global warming . Actor Leonard DiCaprio participates in the People's Climate March earlier this month in New York . Critics described the article as ‘alarmist’ and ‘desperate’. But in a separate commentary, the BMJ’s editor Dr Fiona Godlee defends the piece by saying doctors must understand the problem if they are to help tackle it. It is not the first time the publication – formerly known as the British Medical Journal – and its editor have spoken out on such a highly charged issue. In July, it carried a piece calling for doctors to be allowed to help the terminally ill to die – prompting concern among medics. In her most recent comments, Dr Godlee warns that seven million people die worldwide every year due to pollution and this will only increase if greenhouse gas emissions – which cause global warming – rise further. She points out that reducing these emissions by walking rather than using the car will have added benefits of reducing obesity, heart disease and diabetes. BMJ editor Dr Fiona Godlee says doctors must understand the problem if they are to help tackle it . And she calls on the World Health Organisation to declare the issue a public health emergency – putting it on a par with the current ebola outbreak in West Africa which has claimed 3,000 lives since February. ‘Deaths from ebola infection, tragic and frightening though they are, will pale into insignificance when compared with the mayhem we can expect for our children and grandchildren if the world does nothing to check its carbon emissions. ‘And action is needed now,’ the article concludes. Last year, experts from the . Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that the average global . temperature had risen by 0.5C in 50 years. They predicted that over the . next century temperatures will increase by 3C causing a rise in sea . levels, flooding, disease outbreaks and, as a result, mass migration of . refugees. BMJ wrote that the ‘mayhem’ global warming will inflict on future generations will make deaths from the ebola outbreak ‘pale into insignificance’; above health workers deal with the crisis in Liberia . Politicians are striving to reach an international agreement by December next year on legally-binding targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It would aim to limit global warming to just 2C, and will replace the Kyoto Protocol which came into effect in 2005. However, the last attempt at a deal, at the Copenhagen climate conference in 2009, ended in disaster, and many politicians are worried about a similar result this time. Dr Benny Peiser, of the Global Warming Policy Forum, a think-tank founded by former Chancellor Lord Lawson, accused the BMJ report of being needlessly alarmist. He said: ‘The World Health Organisation would become a global laughing stock if they were to follow the ridiculously over-the-top demands of a green alarmist editor. There is a real disconnect between what they are saying and the reality.’ He added that the article was ‘just desperate’, saying: ‘The smaller the chance of an international agreement, the more desperate they get.’","The BMJ says has called global warming a 'public health emergency'

"America's oldest person has passed away in her Clearwater, Florida, home, just weeks before her 114th birthday. Born on April 5, 1899, Elsie Calvert Thompson was the fourth-oldest person in the world. She died peacefully on March 21 and her family held a memorial service in Clearwater. Her ashes will be buried in Pennsylvania, next to her late husband. Thompson's only child George Thompson, 72, said she died as he flew from his home in California to see her. She had congestive heart failure. Aged nicely: Thompson, pictured with a friend in 1999, enjoyed dancing and singing until the end . 'She had such a big heart,' he told The Tampa Bay Times on Sunday. 'She was such a large person.' Thompson passed the baton to Jeralean Talley, who was born on May 23, 1899. As well as being the oldest person in the US, Talley, from Inkster, Michigan, is the oldest living black person and credits 'the Lord' as her secret to a long life. Thompson was born during the administration of President William McKinley and just a year after the close of the Spanish-American War. She was a stylish dresser who enjoyed ballroom dancing until shortly before her death. She also loved to sing and play the piano, the Times reported. Susie Harper, 59, Thompson's caregiver of 13 years, said she never saw the elderly woman in a bad mood. Long life: On the brink of her 114th birthday, Elsie Calvert Thompson, pictured, died peacefully in her Florida apartment . Secret: At age 111, Thompson divulged the secret to longevity: 'I love people,' she said . In fact, Harper said the 113-year-old . told the Times she glided from bed every morning with a smile and was a . 'tireless hostess' who always offered guests food and drink despite . being well over a century old. 'She would wake up and say, ""Oh my, . won't you look outside? Isn't it beautiful?"" And if it was raining, she . would say, ""That's okay, we'll make our own sunshine,""' Harper said. Thompson . had been in the record books for her remarkable age for four years . before she won the distinguished title of being the oldest living . American. At age 111, Thompson divulged the secret to longevity. 'I love people,' she told the Times back then. She always loved entertaining and . welcoming to visitors, but she wasn't able to celebrate earning her new . title of America's oldest person in January as she had been advised to avoid outside contact . because of the flu epidemic. Record books: Elsie Calvert Thompson was the fourth-oldest person in the world . Big milestone: Elsie Thompson, pictured on her last birthday, was just weeks shy of turning 114 . Those steps are seen as wise by many, as two of the previous title-holders died as a result of infections last month. Both 116-year-old Besse Cooper and 115-year-old Dina Manfredini died in December. Reporters from The Tampa Bay Times . met with Thompson on her 111th, 112th, and 113th birthdays, but the flu . precautions kept them away when she earned her title recently. Thompson was known for having a zest for life that many did not expect of someone her age. 'You'll say, ""Elsie, honey, you wanna get up?"" And she'll say, ""You betcha."" Sometimes she'll talk and talk,' Harper said of the woman in January. Harper had worked with Thompson for the past 13 years as she continued to live in her own condominium in Clearwater, Florida as opposed to an assisted living facility. New elder: Thompson passed the baton to Jeralean Talley, pictured left, who was born on May 23, 1899. As well as being the oldest person in the US, Talley, from Inkster, Michigan, is the oldest living black person . In the record books: Dina Manfredini (left) died due to infection last month at the age of 115, while Japan's Jiroemon Kimura (right) remains the world's oldest person at 115 as well . 'Sometimes when she's tired, she . doesn't want to say anything. But she has a happy and uplifting spirit . about her,' Ms Harper told The Tampa Bay Times. Thompson is one of the only 14 people left on Earth who were on the planet during the 19th century. Thompson stopped traveling to California to visit her son and his family son time before her death. He initially pushed for her to move to be nearer to him and his family when his father- her longtime husband- died in 1986, but she opted to stay in Florida. 'It has continued to work because she's well taken care of,' he told The Tampa Bay Times in January. 'It's a different world here, and she's so familiar with everything there. You should see how she gets around her apartment. She knows exactly where everything is.'","Elsie Calvert Thompson died peacefully on March 21 .

"The head of Scotland Yard was accused yesterday of failing to get a grip on the 'chaotic' scandal of shredded police corruption files. In a stuttering performance before MPs, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe admitted he did not even know how many documents had been destroyed. His extraordinary confession comes nearly two months after his officers found that potentially thousands of files from an internal probe were missing. The Metropolitan Police Commissioner also revealed he had not asked to see a key memo that summarises the destroyed documents. Scroll down for video . Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe dismissed calls for a public inquiry into his force as 'absolute nonsense' The Met under pressure: From the Daily Mail on March 22 . Written by a senior detective, it . reveals officers stole and trafficked illegal drugs, shared rewards cash . with informants, faked applications for more payouts, sold confidential . intelligence to  criminals and accepted bribes to destroy and fabricate . evidence. Yesterday Keith . Vaz said a full parliamentary inquiry into the 'structure, governance . and culture' of the Met would be launched by the home affairs committee. The Labour MP, who chairs the Commons panel, said Sir Bernard had yet . to get a grip on the issue of the 'chaotic' filing operation and his . answers were not reassuring. He . pointed out the Met chief had personally learned of the 2001 shredding . operation on February 4 and it was now March 25. In his evidence Sir . Bernard also told MPs: . Revelations . that the documents, gathered under Operation Othona, were destroyed . came in Mark Ellison QC's review of the Stephen Lawrence investigation, . published on March 6. Dark chapters: Questions remain over whether a . web of corrupt officers undermined investigations into the deaths of . Stephen Lawrence, left, and Daniel Morgan, right . Sir . Bernard was asked repeatedly if the shredding was malicious and corrupt. He could only reply: 'Did the shredding happen? It seems like it did. The question is about the motivation for the shredding. 'There . is an innocent one – it is a normal process of weeding and getting rid . of documents – and there is a malicious one. What we have to establish . is which one it is.' Asked what is missing, he said: 'I just don't know – that is what we are going to have to have an investigation to discover.' Sir . Bernard said the shredding is now believed to have taken place in 2001 – . not 2003 – as originally thought. A female officer had come forward . with details of the destruction of the files, which was carried out when . Sir Bernard was an assistant commissioner. Under fire: Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe was questioned by the home affairs committee today . MPs heard the Met chief had personally learned of the 2001 shredding operation on February 4 . Sir Bernard, who told Mr Vaz it was a 'nonsense' to think that an inquiry was needed, insisted the Met was in good shape. But MPs were left exasperated by Sir Bernard's failure to answer a series of key questions. They . included whether the documents might have been shredded to comply with . human rights law and data protection. Asked repeatedly if this was the . case, he could say only that: 'It is entirely possible'. There . was astonishment when Mr Vaz asked whether Sir Bernard had read three . key reports into possible corruption in the Met. He replied that he had . read only part of one of the dossiers and had not seen the other files. Scotland Yard failed to act on death threats made against the mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, it was claimed last night. Baroness Lawrence discussed the threats – believed to have been made on Twitter – at a recent meeting with Met chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe but nothing further has happened, the Home Affairs Select Committee heard. Committee chairman Keith Vaz told Sir Bernard: 'She said she had a meeting with you, in which it was put to her that you had evidence of people making death threats against her. 'This was done in the presence of a solicitor, yet nothing has happened as far as she can see with regards to anyone coming back to her about this very serious issue.' Sir Bernard replied that he would 'look into it immediately'. In a statement Scotland Yard said it contacted Baroness Lawrence's legal team soon after the meeting to access the Twitter account, and that she was contacted directly a few days later. An investigating officer emailed the Stephen Lawrence Foundation on March 21 and 24, it added. Mr . Vaz also asked Sir Bernard if he had seen the devastating 2012 memo . written by Detective Superintendent David Hurley that summarises the . destroyed files. Mr Vaz said: 'Could I ask have you seen the memo written by Hurley?' Sir Bernard replied:  'I haven't.' Mr . Vaz said: 'Sir Bernard, normally I find you very reassuring, I'm afraid . I don't think we're reassured at the moment.' Disturbing questions now . remain over whether corrupt officers undermined the inquiries into the . murders of Stephen Lawrence and private eye Daniel Morgan in 1987. Stephen's . parents Doreen and Neville have long feared that corruption played a . part in the years of police failings over his racist murder in 1993. Mr . Morgan's family believes the same network of officers shielded those . behind the axe killing of the married father of two. Yesterday Sir . Bernard told MPs that the Met shouldn't be involved in any future . corruption investigation into a former detective called John Davidson, . who worked on both murder inquiries. But . he indicated that he is considering whether a sixth investigation . should be started into the unsolved murder of Mr Morgan, who was said to . have been preparing to expose police corruption when he was killed in a . South East London pub car park. Mr . Ellison's report found that an undercover police officer was working . within the 'Lawrence family camp' in the late 90s as evidence was being . taken for the judicial inquiry led by Sir William Macpherson into . Stephen's death. Mr Ellison . found there is evidence to suspect Mr Davidson acted corruptly. It is . claimed that he had links to Clifford Norris, the gangland boss father . of David Norris, one of the two men who were finally convicted in 2012 . of the teenager's racist murder. It is also claimed that Mr Davidson had links to the failed investigation into the death of Mr Morgan in Sydenham. Mr Davidson disputes the allegations and has always denied them.","A 'lorry load' of destroyed information relates to a corruption probe .

"A father spent nine days in a coma with his skin blistering and peeling off his face after taking ibuprofen for flu. Jason Ryan, 28, from Washington, near Sunderland, suffered the severe allergic reaction which is believed to have been sparked by taking the over-the-counter drug. The bizarre condition is known as Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS), and causes the cells in skin to die before shedding - rather like a snake's. Jason Ryan, 28, from Washington, near Sunderland, suffered a severe allergic reaction which is believed to have been sparked by taking the over-the-counter drug ibuprofen . The disorder affects just two people in every million, but can be fatal if left untreated. The traumatic series of events started when Mr Ryan who works as a Nissan production worker was suffering from flu-like symptoms in May last year. Having taken ibuprofen in the past and suffered no reaction, Mr Ryan and wife Claire had not made the link to the drug when he began to develop blisters. The bizarre condition is known as Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS), which causes the cells in skin to die before shedding - rather like a snake's . Stevens Johnson Syndrome (SJS) is a severe adverse reaction to a medication. It was named after two U.S paediatricians who described it in 1922. It affects around two people per million and is more common among women. Symptoms include skin rashes, blisters in the mouth, ears and nose and swelling of the eyelids. If left untreated the condition can result in death. Possible complications include permanent blindness and lung damage. Once diagnosed doctors will immediately stop the patient taking the offending drug. Treatment includes IV fluids and high calorie formulas  to promote healing. Antibiotics are given when necessary to prevent secondary infections such as sepsis. Pain medications such as morphine can make the patient more comfortable. Mrs Ryan said: 'He already had this rash, like shingles, and he was taking ibuprofen every four hours. It was all over his legs and his back, I knew it wasn't a sweat rash. 'He was taking the ibuprofen and the next day his feet came up in blisters like tennis balls.' Mrs Ryan, mother to seven-year-old Brooke, immediately called for an ambulance but was told to head to her nearest walk-in centre. 'We should have known then,' said she said. 'We were then told to go to the hospital.We could see it progressing; his skin was blistering.' The couple rushed to hospital where Mr Ryan was diagnosed with the potentially fatal condition. One in three who suffer from a severe reaction dies. The rare illness starts with a burning rash on the face and torso which quickly worsens. Various . triggers have been identified by medics, and the drug ibuprofen, used . everyday to treat pain and inflammation, is one of those thought to . occasionally spark the reaction. 'There is no cure for it so it just has to run its course,' said Mrs Ryan. Having taken ibuprofen in the past and suffered no reaction, Mr Ryan and wife Claire had not made the link to the drug when he began to develop blisters . 'Jason's body looked like a horror show, whenever he moved more skin would fall off. He was screaming, it was so raw. Nobody could tell us what was happening because nobody knew. Mr Ryan is now on the road to recovery although he says his progress has been slow . 'I would have preferred him to have had cancer because when I heard one in three die I thought he has no chance. 'We were told it would last for 14 days and he was in a coma for nine days, It was the worst time of my life. I kept thinking, 'What am I going to tell our daughter Brooke?' Jason is our world. ' Mr Ryan said: 'The funny thing is Claire can remember everything and I don't remember anything. All I remember is waking up with my body changed. 'I went to sleep weighing about 13st and woke up being about 9st. 'I couldn't move my arms or legs, all I could move was my head.I thought my life, like my wife and daughter, were just a dream.' Mr Ryan pulled through and is back at home with is family, although the syndrome can return. She has become Mr Ryan carer full-time and is unable to continue her work showing and breeding dogs. 'We are all suffering,' she said. 'It isn't good. 'Jason is like a little old man but he is getting stronger and stronger all the time. It is more the mental side. He has post traumatic stress disorder but he is getting better. He is still my Jason.' Mr Ryan said: 'I have lost interest in all my hobbies but right now is the best I have ever been since I was ill. 'I haven't been able to get up for months.I get up and I have to go and lie down at 12pm. 'Claire has been brilliant, I couldn't ask for anything more from her. 'I want to thank my wife, if it wasn't for her I would be dead.I probably wouldn't have gone to hospital and it could have gone very differently.'","Jason Ryan, 28, is from Washington, near Sunderland .

"Care: A study has found a third more heart attack patients died a month later in Britain than Sweden . More than 11,000 deaths of heart attack patients could have been avoided if British care was as good as Sweden's, a study has claimed. A third more Britons than Swedes died within a month of having a heart attack, according to the research on half a million patients. Scientists from University College London examined death rates in the two countries between 2004 and 2010. They said a key reason for the striking difference between the two was that British patients are not receiving the best possible treatment. Professor Harry Hemingway, from University College London, said: 'Our findings are a cause for concern. 'The uptake and use of new technologies and effective treatments recommended in guidelines has been far quicker in Sweden. This has contributed to large differences in the management and outcomes of patients.' In total, the team analysed records relating to 391,077 patients from 242 hospitals in the UK and 119,786 from 86 hospitals in Sweden. They found that 30 days after a heart attack, 10.5 per cent of patients discharged from hospital were dead in the UK compared with 7.6 per cent in Sweden. At the start of the study the difference was even more stark, with almost 50 per cent more patients dying in the UK than in Sweden. But by 2010, the gap had narrowed to 20 per cent. Taking into account age and sex differences, heart attack severity, risk factors including rates of smoking and diabetes, and other influences, the scientists estimated that over the study period 11,263 British lives could have been saved by matching Swedish standards. Co-author Dr Tomas Jernberg, from the Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden, said: 'Our findings suggest that failure to get the best treatment is one likely reason why short-term survival for heart attack patients is lower in the UK.' Concerning: The study, which looked at half a million patient records, said surgery and drugs like beta blockers were offered earlier and more often Sweden than in Britain, and processes must be improved . The study found drugs such as beta . blockers were less likely to be prescribed to British patients and surgery on constructed coronary arteries were used earlier and more often in Sweden - 59 per cent of the time compared with 22 per cent in the UK. The research was published in the medical journal The Lancet. Dr Mike Knapton, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: 'The reasons behind the differing survival rates are complex, but one explanation could be the speed with which the two countries adopted primary angioplasty as an emergency treatment. 'Sweden's early adoption meant they saw the benefits quicker and this is reflected in the figures. However, the UK has caught up and last year the majority of patients received this treatment. 'The lesson here for the UK is that we need to be led by the research and introduce pioneering practices quickly and on a large scale.'","Study compared death rates in the two countries from 2004 to 2010 .

According to U.S. intelligence officials, the programs target foreigners and terrorist suspects mostly overseas. Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told reporters in Berlin on Wednesday that ‘whoever fears their communication is being intercepted in any way should use services that don't go through American servers.’ Friedrich says German officials are in touch with their U.S. counterparts ‘on all levels’ and a delegation is scheduled to fly to Washington next week to discuss the claims that ordinary citizens and even European diplomats were being spied upon. Leak: Whistleblower Edward Snowden, revealed that the US National Security Agency collected date of phone records and some Internet traffic of average citizens . In the wake of the NSA scandal, Friedrich defended the intelligence unit's methods against German criticism. In . an interview with Welt am Sontag the Interior minister said that that . turning against the US is 'not how you deal with friends who are in the . fight against terrorism, our most important partners' Meanwhile, Snowden is now running out of countries that will take him in - a growing list have either denied his request for asylum or insisted that he make an application on their soil. Earlier today Bolivia's president Evo Morales attacked US 'aggression' after his plane was rerouted last night amid suspicions that NSA leaker Edward Snowden was on board.

"A church advertising campaign that depicted atheists as stupid has been banned by a watchdog in South Africa. Officials ruled a billboard that suggested non-believers considered their existence to be accidental was likely to be found offensive. The advertisement, which had been erected beside a church in Johannesburg, was pulled down following the ruling by South Africa's Advertising Standards Authority. Pulled down: Officials ruled a billboard erected outside a Johannesburg church that suggested atheists considered their existence to be accidental was likely to be found offensive . The offending poster showed a picture of a man holding his hands against his temples in thought above the line 'An atheist is a man who believes himself to be an accident', famously attributed to British poet Francis Thompson. It was erected last year in a prominent position on the property of the Rivers Church in the Sandton suburb of Johannesburg. However, the ASA noted that it was obliged to consider the advertisement's content after it received a complaint from a non-Christian member of the public. Laying out its judgement on the matter, the authority stated that the complainant, Eugene Gerber, felt offended by the suggestion he was stupid. The ruling stated: 'In essence, the complainant submitted that the billboard offends him as an atheist as he does not consider his existence to be an accident. 'Secondly, the depiction of a man with an empty head communicates that atheists are stupid.' In a four-page judgement, the ASA noted that it had considered the billboard in terms of a clause in South Africa's advertising code preventing content which could offend. Where it hung: The billboard erected outside Rivers Church in the Sandton suburb of Johannesburg . The authority stated that the church . leaders had responded to the complaint by saying they believed the . public would recognise the quote as the work of Thompson, who wrote . during the late nineteenth century and died in 1907. The ASA wrote: 'The respondent submitted that the advertisement is based on Psalm 14v and Psalm 53v1, which say ""only foolish say in their hearts there is no God"". 'The implication of the image was meant to convey that if someone does not believe in God, then they are not wise. 'It quoted the famous English poet Francis Thompson thinking that most people would be familiar with his work and would possibly respect his comment.' However, the advertising authority judgement said the watchdog believed the quotation printed alongside an image of a man shaking his head was likely to cause gratuitous offence to atheists. It wrote: 'It is apparent that the . proverbial line is drawn when advertising propagates statements that . undermine the dignity and constitutionally protected right to freedom of . religious beliefs of any identifiable sector of society. 'The Directorate notes that the respondent has made use of a quote ""An atheist is a man who believes himself to be an accident"" by Francis Thompson, however this does not justify its use in this context. 'The Merriam Webster online dictionary defines an accident as, ""An unforeseen and unplanned event or circumstance"".

"'For me, Chelsea's best player is Branislav Ivanovic. He's the best defender in Europe. I don't understand why nobody talks about him. It’s strange because I think he’s complete. He’s got everything. He's very strong, he’s got a good jump, he's fast and he's got good technique. He's a warrior.' It's fair to say Robert Pires isn't a bad judge. The former Arsenal and France international has won a thing or two but it is never easy to pour such glowing praise on your old enemy. As he proved at the Parc des Princes again on Tuesday night though, Ivanovic is a player every man on the street would like on his team. Branislav Ivanovic heads home from close range to give Chelsea the lead at Parc des Princes on Tuesday . The Serbia international slides on his knees after scoring another crucial goal for Chelsea . He is subsequently mobbed by his Chelsea team-mates as they celebrate their goal in the French capital . Branislav Ivanovic has scored seven goals in the Champions League since 2009, more than any other defender. He has netted 30 times in all competitions since joining Chelsea in 2008. He is a throwback to the defenders of old, ruthless, uncompromising, takes no prisoners, leaves no-one behind; he is a leader of men and, for Chelsea, so often their saviour. His blood-stained right boot worn in the bruising Capital One Cup semi-final against Liverpool is primed for Chelsea's academy. It is an example to aspiring players of what really matters in sport. It's not money, not flash watches but the commitment, dedication and pain it takes to get to the very top. The other white, relatively unblemished Nike boot is to be framed and mounted in Ivanovic's Surrey home - but only if Chelsea win the Capital One Cup. Ivanovic's blood-stained boot in the Capital One Cup semi-final against Liverpool is destined for the academy . At half-time against Liverpool, Ivanovic limped back to dressing room, poured the blood out of his boot and asked to be cleaned up. A bullet-hole wound caused by a stud on the bridge of his foot was plugged, strapped and Ivanovic asked for an injection. 'It was really painful during the game, a lot of swelling, like any wound, but it’s all right. It’s just a wound, it’s open. I didn’t have stitches because they didn’t want to close the wound because of the inflammation.' That's OK, then. Days later when Jose Mourinho surveyed the walking wounded he was selecting to face champions Manchester City his eyes focused on the burly defender he holds in such esteem limping into the dressing room. 'Are you ok Bane?' he asked. 'Don't worry about me. Just look after the others,' came the reply. Mourinho didn't expect anything else. Ivanovic celebrates his winning goal against Aston Villa earlier this month . Willian cleans his team-mates boot after the Serb's goal with 24 minutes remaining at Villa Park . Manchester City marked a milestone for Ivanovic as a Chelsea player. He needed the aid of an injection but there was no way he was missing this, his 300th game. Not one for too many mementos, Ivanovic kept the boots and shirt from that game to frame. Sadly, opportunist thieves stole them from his car later that night. He still didn't make a fuss, even though it has taken a lot of hard work to make it this far. The early days were ones of despair when Avram Grant barely played him. Often he battled to impress his new club. Manchester United captain Nemanja Vidic recalled getting caught in a fight with his compatriot during a typically combative United-Chelsea encounter. 'I said: ''what are you doing? We are Serbs.'' Ivanovic said: ''Even if you were family I would fight you, I want to win''.' Invanovic poses with Avram Grant after agreeing a deal to join Chelsea back in January 2008 . Ivanvoic poses with his team-mates ahead of the new season; he is pictured sporting a rare beard . As Ivanovic says: 'You need to motivate yourself. To go over the limit. Even if you don’t think someone is against you, you have to find motivation. It is important in winning matches to find extra motivation inside yourself. Sometimes we need to feel this extra pressure.' Everton's James McCarthy may beg to differ after his throttling at the hands of Ivanovic, but that quality makes him a coach's dream. Mourinho wanted Ivanovic when he went to Real Madrid. Monaco and Barcelona enquired and Paris Saint-Germain would still like to sign him now. Surprisingly, he has just 18 months left on contract and the fact he has turned 30 is Chelsea's excuse for, so far, postponing discussions over a new deal. For Ivanovic, it's not about the money. It's about respect. Raheem Sterling said he is the scariest player he has faced, 'a human tank.' Ivanvoic grabs James McCarthy round the neck during Chelsea's win at Everton earlier this month . The defender was described by Raheem Sterling as the scariest player he has faced . His good friend, tennis star Novak Djokovic talks of a mutual admiration. Luis Suarez was grateful he didn't tell all about his infamous bite. 'Bane' shuns club attempts to get him on Facebook and Twitter. He turns down lucrative commercial deals because he simply doesn't see a need to take money for a product he doesn't like. He drives the same Q7 Audi he bought when he joined Chelsea seven years ago. It's practical for taking his family around town. An intensely private man, he enjoys nothing better than a family day with wife and childhood sweetheart Natasa, son Stefan and twins Andreja and Ana. The Chelsea defender poses with his wife Natasa at Novak Djokovic's gala dinner in London last year . Ivanovic pictured in action for former club Lokomotiv Moscow against CSKA Moscow in 2006 . He doesn't wear a watch, the Rolex presented for being part of Chelsea's Champions League winning side gets an occasional dusting. Parties and fashion are not his forte as his team-mates often jest - but he is still the man they turn to for advice. Ivanovic is on the Chelsea players' committee where senior figures help the younger ones with problems and liaise with management. It's a compassionate and understanding side that many a trainee appreciates and he puts it to further use as the patron of 'Ballboys' a charity that fights the fight against testicular cancer. Newcastle's Jonas Gutierrez has been grateful for his support. 'A competitive animal, a big heart,' was how Jose Mourinho described him. Understated, yes, but that's just how Branislav Ivanovic likes to play it.","Branislav Ivanovic scored another key goal for Chelsea in their PSG draw .

"British war planes will  begin air strikes on Iraq today amid a spiralling political row over whether they should also hit Islamic State fanatics in neighbouring Syria. Six RAF Tornados are expected to join US, French and Arab air strikes – their first in Iraq for six years – after MPs voted overwhelmingly to go into a third Gulf War. Warning that the fight to crush IS could last for years, not months, David Cameron told an emergency session of Parliament that as well as murdering Western hostages with ‘staggering brutality’ the group was plotting terrorist attacks in Britain. Scroll down for video . Prime Minister David Cameron warned IS has behaved with 'staggering brutality' as he opened the debate ahead of the vote in Parliament . Six RAF Tornados are expected to join US, French and Arab air strikes – their first in Iraq for six years . ‘This is about psychopathic terrorists trying to kill us,’ the Prime Minister said. ‘We do have to realise that whether we like it or not, they have already declared war on us.’ MPs authorised military action by 524 votes to 43, one of the biggest Commons majorities since the last general election. But last night Labour education spokesman Rushanara Ali resigned, saying she could not support air strikes. And defence spokesman Vernon Coaker was forced to sack aide Iain McKenzie for voting against strikes in Iraq. Mr Cameron said that there was a ‘strong case’ for extending air strikes against IS, also known as Isil or Isis, from Iraq into Syria, where it has also seized vast areas. Cameron leaving Parliament after MPs backed the Government motion authorising military action against IS . IS now controls territory the size of the UK. ‘I am very clear: Isil needs to be destroyed in Syria as well as Iraq,’ he said. ‘We support the action that the US and five Arab states have taken in Syria.’ The Prime Minister even suggested he might be prepared to intervene in Syria without seeking a vote in Parliament if it would avert a ‘humanitarian catastrophe’ or there was an immediate threat to Britain. But he ruled out deploying British combat troops – though special forces are already operating in the region, and troops may be deployed to train regional forces acting on the ground. Although Labour leader Ed Miliband backed action in Iraq, he prompted a backlash from both Conservative and Labour MPs by saying Britain would have to seek a United Nations resolution authorising any attacks on Syria. This is the text of the motion passed by MPs after a six-hour debate: . 'That this House condemns the barbaric acts of ISIL against the peoples of Iraq including the Sunni, Shia, Kurds, Christians and Yazidi and the humanitarian crisis this is causing; . 'Recognises the clear threat ISIL poses to the territorial integrity of Iraq and the request from the Government of Iraq for military support from the international community and the specific request to the UK Government for such support; . 'Further recognises the threat ISIL poses to wider international security and the UK directly through its sponsorship of terrorist attacks and its murder of a British hostage; . 'Acknowledges the broad coalition contributing to military support of the Government of Iraq including countries throughout the Middle East; . 'Further acknowledges the request of the Government of Iraq for international support to defend itself against the threat ISIL poses to Iraq and its citizens and the clear legal basis that this provides for action in Iraq; . 'Notes that this motion does not endorse UK air strikes in Syria as part of this campaign and any proposal to do so would be subject to a separate vote in Parliament; . 'Accordingly supports Her Majesty's Government, working with allies, in supporting the Government of Iraq in protecting civilians and restoring its territorial integrity, including the use of UK air strikes to support Iraqi, including Kurdish, security forces' efforts against ISIL in Iraq; . 'Notes that Her Majesty's Government will not deploy UK troops in ground combat operations; . 'And offers its wholehearted support to the men and women of Her Majesty's armed forces.' This effectively blocks the Government from taking action because Russia has already pledged to veto any such resolution. ‘In my view, when we are not talking about being invited in by a democratic state it would be better – I put it no higher than that – it would be better to seek a UN Security Council resolution,’ he told the Commons. However, his stance was criticised by some senior Labour figures because it effectively leaves the decision in the hands of Russia. Former minister Pat McFadden said: ‘Why is it right to come to the aid of the victims of Isis who are living under a democracy in Iraq but not those who are living under a dictatorship in Syria?’ Backing military action, Labour leader Ed Miliband said 'although this is difficult, it's the right thing to do' Former Labour defence secretary Lord Hutton said: ‘My concern has been that we’ve almost closed down any sort of action in Syria, we’ve closed down any discussion about support troops on the ground and I would much prefer those options to be kept open.’ Defence Secretary Michael Fallon suggested the Government might ask MPs to support extending air strikes into Syria. ‘Isil is based in Syria, that’s where its headquarters are, that’s where its resources, its people are,’ he said. ‘To deal with Isil you do have to deal and defeat them in both Iraq and in Syria.’ Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander later said that Labour would not insist on a UN resolution before considering action in Syria. Justin Welby gave his backing to air strikes in Iraq, telling the House of Lords that the 'perverted’ ideology of IS was just one part of a global problem . The Archbiship of Canterbury gave his backing to air strikes in Iraq, but issued a pointed warning to religious leaders to ‘up their game’ against the threat of radical Islam. Justin Welby told the House of Lords that the ‘twisted and perverted’ ideology of IS was just one part of a global problem. He said there was justification for armed force in the short-term to help victims of their ‘dreadful brutality’. But military action could not solve what is a ‘global, ideological, religious and trans-generational challenge’ which threatens to plunge the world into ‘endless darkness’. ‘Religious leaders must up their game,’ he said, ‘and the church is playing its part... The action proposed today is right, but we must not rely on a short-term solution. ‘We must demonstrate that there is a positive vision far greater and more compelling than the evil of IS and its global clones.’ The debate in the Lords, in which dozens of peers spoke, saw a majority in favour of air strikes. Baroness Stowell, for the Government, said that destroying the ‘evil extremism’ of IS in Iraq would be in the interests of Britain’s national security. But former Tory minister Michael Ancram, the Marquess of Lothian, said that ‘we should hold our fire’. He said: ‘Our mind is not closed and we have not made a UN Security Council resolution a condition of future action… Our moral compass is not set in Moscow or Beijing… we have said very clearly that there is a legal basis for action.’ Opening an often impassioned six-and-a-half hour debate, Mr Cameron warned that IS posed a direct threat to Britain that could not be ignored. ‘This is not a threat on the far side of the world,’ he said. ‘Left unchecked, we will face a terrorist caliphate on the shores of the Mediterranean, bordering a Nato member, with a declared and proven determination to attack our country and our people.’ Mr Cameron said the war against Isil would take ‘not just months, but years’, adding: ‘The hallmarks of this campaign will be patience and persistence, not shock and awe.’ Outside Parliament, protesters held placards which read 'Don't Bomb Iraq' but inside the Commons MPs insisted the situation was different to the 2003 invasion of Iraq ordered by Tony Blair . Some relatives of kidnapped British taxi driver Alan Henning, the latest hostage threatened with beheading by IS, have warned that air strikes could reduce their chances of ever seeing him again. But Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond insisted the attacks would make little difference to the fate of Westerners held by IS. ÷Firebrand Muslim preacher Anjem Choudary and seven other men were released on bail last night after being questioned by counter terrorism detectives. Choudary, 47, and ten other members of his inner circle were arrested in London and Rugby, Warwickshire, on suspicion of supporting banned extremist group al-Muhajiroun, which he co-founded almost 20 years ago. His friend, Trevor Brooks, 39, now known as Abu Izzadeen, was charged with breaching a counter terrorism order by giving police false information. He will appear before magistrates today.","Six RAF Tornados are expected to start bombing IS bases in Iraq today .

"A television station has issued an apology after one of their anchors was caught telling parents to 'do their f***ing jobs' live on air. Matt Pieper from News 12 The Bronx in New York made the slip up while insulting anyone who relied on government assistance 'for their entire lives' on Wednesday morning. He then continued to joke about it for a long time, without realizing the camera was still rolling. Scroll down for video . Matt Pieper from News 12 The Bronx said parents should 'do their f***ing jobs'while insulting anyone who was on government assistance on Wednesday morning . Thinking it was a commercial break, Pieper was talking to another reporter about school crossing guards when he said: 'Two minutes and Dave [a colleague] wants you to talk about how parents should do their f***ing jobs and take their kids to school and not rely on everyone else, kind of like people who rely on government assistance for their entire lives.' The other reporter laughs at the joke before Pieper adds: 'It's true, I mean, how old are these kids?' In the amateur video that captured the mistake, the person recording says: 'Did he just say that?' The camera keeps on recording while the anchor neatens up his tie and scratches with no knowledge he has made the huge gaff. The station was later forced to issue an apology on its Facebook page. It read: 'As a result of a technical error during a program break this morning, a personal conversation between an anchor and a reporter was unintentionally placed on the air. 'The conversation included offensive language and inappropriate commentary. News 12 the Bronx deeply regrets that this incident took place.' 'The remarks of these individuals in no way reflect the views of News 12 management or other News 12 personnel. Steps have been taken to deal with the employees involved and resolve the technical issues. 'We take this incident extremely seriously and we sincerely apologize to all who may have been offended.'

"Brittany Maynard does not have a death wish, but she wants to be the one calling the shots when it comes to the time and manner of her passing - not her terminal cancer. At age 29, Maynard was filled with bright hopes for the future: starting a family with her newlywed husband, traveling and going on mountain-climbing adventures with her friends. But on January 1, 2014, everything changed: doctors determined that the source of her persistent headaches was an aggressive malignant tumor in her brain. Scroll down for video . Devastating news: Brittany Maynard, pictured left and right with her newlywed husband, Dan Diaz, learned this past January that she is dying from brain cancer . Doctors determined that the source of her persistent headaches was an aggressive malignant tumor . Silent killer: The 29-year-old woman was diagnosed with Stage 4 glioblastoma - an aggressive malignant tumor in her brain . Hopes dashed: The young couple were thinking of starting a family when the awful diagnosis came . At first, Brittany was given 5-10 years to live, but then in April Maynard was diagnosed with Stage 4 glioblastoma, which will likely take her life within six months. Maynard, a vivacious young woman described by her mother as precocious and larger than life, decided then and there to take her life, or whatever was left of it, into her own hands. On Monday, Mrs Maynard launched an online video campaign for Compassion & Choices, an end-of-life non-profit organization, to promote death-with-dignity laws, which currently exist in only five states. In order to have the option of ending her life on her own terms, Maynard, her husband, Dan Diaz, and her parents moved from San Francisco to Portland, Oregon, which has a death-with-dignity legislation on the books. On November 1, Maynard plans to take a pill given to her by her doctors and painlessly fade away surrounded by her loved ones in her and Dan's bedroom, with her favorite music playing in the background. Video courtesy of Compassion & Choices . Special child: Debbie Maynard (left), Brittany's mother, said her daughter, pictured right as a girl, has always been precocious and adventurous . Fearless: Instead of allowing the illness to slowly and painfully kill her, Maynard made the decision to end her own life next month . Painless death: Maynard and her family moved to Oregon - one of five states with death-with-dignity laws - where doctors prescribed her pills that would help her end her life without any suffering . Endless sleep: On November 1, Maynard will get into her martial bed, pictured, surrounded by her family and close friends, take a pill and end her suffering . But Brittany Maynard wants everyone to know: what she is planning to do is not a suicide. ‘There is not a cell in my body that is suicidal or that wants to die,’ she told People Magazine in an exclusive interview. ‘I want to live. I wish there was a cure for my disease but there's not.’ The 29-year-old Portland resident said she decided on this course of action after hearing from her doctors what would happen to her body in the final stages of her illness. ‘I can’t even tell you the amount of relief that it provided me to know that I don’t have to die the way it’s been described to me that my brain tumor would take me on its own,’ Maynard says in the YouTube video. Since Oregon lawmakers passed the Death with Dignity Act in 1997, more than 1,170 people have obtained prescriptions under the law, and fewer than half of them used them to end their lives. Bucket list: Since her devastating diagnosis, Maynard has been traveling around the country with her loved ones, hoping to see as many natural wonders as possible . Accompanied by her husband and best friend, Maynard had visited Yellowstone National Park and Alaska . Special day: Brittany decide to go on November 1 so she could celebrate her husband's (right) birthday on October 30 . Washington, Montana, Vermont and New Mexico also allow people to die on their own terms, but Maynard says it is not enough. ‘Right now it's a choice that's only available to some Americans, which is really unethical,’ she said. Since her diagnosis, the 29-year-old cancer patient has become an advocate for dying with dignity. Working through her foundation, The Brittany Fund, Maynard wants other states, like California, New Jersey and Colorado, to consider passing laws that would allow people to make the ultimate choice - life or death. Despite increasing pain, seizures and growing weakness, Maynard has remained active, traveling around the country with her family and best friend to try and visit as many places on her bucket list as possible before November 1 - the day after her husband’s birthday. So far, Brittany has journeyed to Alaska and took a trip to Yellowstone National Park with husband Dan, but she still hopes to see the Grand Canyon before the end. Sacred vow: Brittany has made a promise to her mother, Debbie, to meet her in spirit in Machu Pichu, Peru . She also has made a deal with her mother, Debbie, that if she travels to Machu Pichu in Peru after her passing, Brittany’s spirit will meet her up there among the breathtaking Inca ruins. With less than one month to go before the date chosen by Maynard as her final day on earth, the young woman reminds everyone what is truly important in life. ‘Seize the day, what's important to you, what you care about, what matters,’ she says. ‘Pursue that -forget the rest.’","Brittany Maynard was diagnosed with Stage 4 glioblastoma earlier this year and given six months to live .

"Holy grail? Stylist Mark Heyes says finding the perfect pair of jeans needn't be a nightmare . They are the uniform of the world, the go-to item in the wardrobes of people from all walks of life. But despite their extraordinary popularity, many of us find buying jeans a hellish experience. It was revealed on the Lorraine show this morning that recent research showed women have an average of 10 pairs of jeans in their wardrobes - but they wear only two of them. And seven out of 10 women admit they never wear jeans at all, so impossible do they find it to get a pair of jeans they like. It's fashion's quixotic quest: we expect so much from our jeans. We . want them to lift and shape a flat bottom, slim a thigh and lengthen a . leg - all the while ridding us of our dreaded muffin top and wobbly tummy... miracles that surely only a combination of freakishly good genes and . a talented surgeon could achieve. How could a simple item of clothing hope to meet our demands? Still, that doesn't prevent us from . trying to find that denim Holy Grail - and it is partly the level of our . expectations that sees us storming out of changing rooms leaving behind . a tangled mess of discarded denim in our wake. On average, women try on five pairs of jeans before they find a pair they like. But it doesn't have to be this way. Celebrity stylist Mark Heyes says . there really is a pair of jeans out there for everyone - it's just a . matter of finding the right ones. 'I think it's interesting - so many women think they have to spend a fortune on designer jeans - but they really don't,' he said. 'The High Street is a great place to shop for them. Almost all the High Street jeans have a small amount of Lycra content to give them stretch, which makes a huge difference.' 'It might not be as good quality as the top designer brands so they might not last you as long, but they are so inexpensive you can replace them. 'I always say if you find a pair you love, go out and buy three pairs - you'll have them for a good wee while.' Mark recommends Moto in Topshop, River Island and Oasis as the High Street places to shop for jeans. 'I 'fess up,' he says. 'I used to . love my Dior Homme jeans, and I'd buy them at £180 a time. But all of a . sudden the price went up to £400 - I kid you not. Muffin top . Builder's bottom . 'Sausage skin' look from too-tight jeans . Gaping waistband . Ankle swingers on tall women . 'I couldn't spend that on a pair of jeans. I started going to the High Street, and I found that Gap has a really great range of jeans, and . the staff are trained to an extremely good level if you explain to . them what you want.' Beware the style rut though, explains Mark. 'It's easy to get stuck in a rut with a pair of denims,' he says. 'I said on Lorraine this morning that for girls with larger hips, bootcut are the most . flattering - but if I'd have had more time to explain, I'd have said . that women shouldn't just stick to bootcut without trying other styles. 'The bootcut can be a little ageing, a . bit Noughties - like you're stuck in that Stella McCartney era of . wearing bootcut jeans and a sparkly top. 'Be cautions. The word 'skinny' scares people, but in reality, whatever your size, skinny or straight leg jeans tend to look so much better. 'I will often put a size 18 or 20 woman in pair of jeans but treat them like leggings and put a top or tailoring over the top.' One of the more common issues women face is the gaping waistband, Mark says. 'So many girls say to me that the . gape at the back is infuriating. I've found the curvier models - size 16 . plus and a lot of black girls I style need a certain size to fit their . bottoms, but are left with a gaping waistband. 'River Island seem have been able to cut their some of their jeans so they don't have the gape at the back.' Top tips: High-waisted jeans are best left to models in photoshoots or those under 18, says Mark - choose high rise instead to help conceal a tummy. RIGHT: Pockets on the derriere make the bottom look smaller, as demonstrated by the lovely Joan Collins in 1981 . 'If you are conscious of your tummy, a . high-rise - not high-waisted (you don't want to look like Kath and Kim) will offer a bit of security. 'You want the waistband to sit just below the belly button to hold in that little bit of tummy without looking old fashioned.' But he warns it's important not to mistake . high-rise for high-waisted jeans. The 70s look that is so successful . in campaign images is best left to the very youthful, he says. 'Even though high-waisted denims are . all over Miss Selfridge, for instance, they are incredibly hard to wear. To me, they only really work in photoshoots - they look a bit daft in . real life. 'They create a tummy where there isn't one and make the bottom look bigger than it is.' But when it comes to strong flash-in-the-pan trends, Mark says go for it. 'Patterned denim - like those leopard . print Current/Elliot jeans we are seeing everywhere are good fun. If . you love your jeans, go with it - fashion's about having fun and they'll . be a great staple for your autumn/winter wardrobe. 'But from an investment point of . view, you might not get the most out of them if you spend a fortune. My . rule is, if it's very trend led, go on the High Street - it's brilliant.in the UK.' When it comes to shapes that are here to stay, Mark is all about the skinny. 'I always talk about the three season . rule - if something lasts for three seasons or more, it becomes a . wardrobe basic, and we've been seeing the skinny jeans silhouette for at least 10 seasons now. 'That is what happened with jumpsuits - . they started off on the catwalk, as proper high fashion, then after a . couple of seasons Wallis is doing them and they're here to stay.' Darker denims will give a slimmer silhouette . Pockets on derriere make the bottom seem smaller . Avoid overhang - choose a higher waistband to smooth our lumps and bumps . Curvy girls: Try bootcut for balance - but don't get stuck in a Noughties style rut - do try skinnies too, they can often be more flattering . Buy jeans in proportion to waist and hips to prevent gaping at the waistband .

As any online shopper knows, a 'medium' top by one designer can be labelled 'extra small' by another. Now one Italian fashion start-up is hoping to take the guesswork out of shopping from different brands by using a smart tape measure to translate sizes . The tape has been developed by XYZE, which is pronounced 'size', who is currently attempting to raise funds to commercialise the gadget on Indiegogo. The gadget measures 2.05 x 1.12 x 1.97 inches (52 x 28.5 x 50 mm) and is powered by a three-volt battery that the company claims lasts at least two years. The accompany app, currently being developed for Android and iOS, will show users the correct way to take measurements. These measurements are saved in a XYZE ID, which is an algorithm that calculates the best fit for a user based on their size and a brand's sizing. Dubbed 'On', the 63-inch (160cm) loop of tape claims to accurately measure users and then transmit that data via Bluetooth to a smartphone . Early birds can get the gadget, which has been 18 months in development, for $45 (£29) if they sign up to the Indiegogo campaign. The price then goes up to $67 (£44) XYZE is hoping retailers will integrate the system into their websites to make it simpler for On users to find their sizes. The Treviso-based company is now hoping to raise over $68,000 (£44,000) and to start shipping the On in July. Early birds can get the gadget, which has been 18 months in development, for about $45 (£29). The price then goes up to $67 (£44).

"The United States has found around 1,200 opposition fighters in Syria that could participate in US military led training programs to fight against ISIS, the Pentagon said Wednesday. The fighters will undergo vetting for the program, which is . expected to begin in March at multiple sites outside of Syria . and train more than 5,000 Syrian fighters a year. Some 3,000 . could be trained by the end of 2015, a US official said. The program is expected to vet fighters using both US government databases as well as intelligence from regional . partners. Rebel forces: The United States has found around 1,200 opposition fighters in Syria that could participate in US military led training programs to fight against ISIS, the Pentagon said Wednesday (file photo) Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar have publicly offered to host . the training and Jordan has privately offered to do so. One US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said training is . likely to start in Jordan. At the Pentagon, spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby declined . to specify which sites might host the potential Syrian recruits . identified so far. 'There's about 1,200 individuals who have been identified . for participation - potential participation - in this process . and in this program,' Kirby told a news conference. 'Where they . will be trained, I don't have that information right now,' Kirby added. On Tuesday, the United States and Turkey said they expected . to soon sign an agreement on training and equipping moderate . Syrian opposition fighters. Turkey hopes the program will also . bolster the broader opposition in its fight against Syrian . President Bashar al-Assad. US officials have made clear the . objective of the military's training program, however, is . battling ISIS. Training: Forces of the Jaish al-Islam, or Army of Islam, train in a rebel stronghold outside of Damascus. Shifting alliances have made sorting out 'moderate' rebels a difficult task for the US. Several US officials have told Reuters the Syrian fighters . would be equipped with items including pickup trucks with . mounted machine guns, often known as technicals, radios and GPS. The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that the radios . and GPS equipment would enable the fighters to call in . airstrikes. Kirby stressed that the training mission was not . meant to create 'Syrian forward air controllers,' although he . acknowledged their potential assistance in identifying targets. The Pentagon has previously estimated that more than 400 . U.S. troops, including special operations forces, will train . Syrian fighters. Hundreds more US forces will be sent to . support them. Kirby estimated that the total force involved in . the training mission could reach about 1,000 troops.","The program will be led by the US military to train and equip forces .

"Anthony Weiner's brother today 'categorically denied' attempting to silence the girl at the heart of the shamed congressman's latest sexting scandal. Speaking to MailOnline, Jason, a chef in New York, claimed that he 'heard the name for the first time along with everyone else two days ago or perhaps yesterday?' He insisted that he had 'never spoken to her or emailed or anything'. But Leather's close friend and confidante, Lou Colagiovanni, said that the exchange had left her 'scared and shaken' and he stood by his claim. Colagiovanni said that the contact was made on April 12 two days after an article ran in the New York Times in which Weiner presented himself as a reformed man, after the scandal that saw him leave Congress one year earlier. Communications published in the original exposé by theDirty.com in which Weiner refers to a third party having contacted Leathers. Which begs the question if it wasn't his brother Jason, as Colagiovanni claims, then who was it? Breaking her silence: Sydney Leathers, 23, talked to Inside Edition in an interview that aired Thursday night . Weiner's girl: Sydney Leathers, now 23, claimed that she and Weiner exchanged racy messages and photos for six months starting in July 2012 . Her side: MailOnline can now reveal that Leathers' confidante claimed him that Weiner's brother Jason tried to keep her from telling her story . Certainly Mr Colagiovanni is adamant . that Leathers was 'scared and shaken' by an attempt to silence her at a . time when, she insisted, she had told nobody of the relationship. Ms Leathers, who reportedly wants to . sell her story for $100,000, gave an interview to Inside Edition saying . that Weiner, who is married and has a young son, told her that he loved . her during their six-month affair. In . an interview with MailOnline, Lou Colagiovanni , 29, a friend and . confidante of Leathers for two years claims: ‘This happened on April 12, 2013. Weiner’s brother contacted Sydney because she had written something about Weiner on her Facebook wall. ‘His brother was trying to smooth-over any problems which leads me to believe he may have done this before with other mistresses. ‘Sydney was scared by the contact. Bear in mind she had never spoken to the brother. Absolutely she was shaken by it. ‘You have to remember at that stage she hadn’t told anyone about the relationship. ‘She had been sitting on it for months. Initially she didn’t want the story to come out but this was very clearly a damage control exercise.’ When contacted this afternoon, Weiner's spokesperson, told MailOnline: 'This is untrue'. Proof: Anthony Weiner sent Sydney Leathers a message saying that his brother had asked him about her months before Jason Weiner denied knowing who she was or sending her a 'scary' warning. Damage control: Anthony Weiner (seen left at a kitchen event on Thursday) reportedly had his brother Jason (a professional chef, at right) talk to Leathers about the status of their virtual affair . According to Mr Colegiovanni: ‘The brothers were acting as each other’s wingmen. It seemed quite clearly what Weiner had his brother do for him – damage control. ‘The irony is by doing so all they did was cause all this to come out because it left Sydney scared. She sent me a message and said she had a story she wanted to tell me.’ At that stage, Mr Colegiovanni pointed out: ‘Only Sydney and her psychotherapist new about it.’ The new claim of Weiner’s effort to put a lid on Leathers having clearly detected her growing frustration and distaste for the man she once ‘idolized’ is even more damaging in light of his recent ‘mea culpa,' in which he claimed to have always been resigned to more information coming out. Mr Colegiovanni first met Sydney in April 2010 when he employed her as moderator and content producer and editor of his political website ‘We Survived Bush You Will Survive Obama.’ The fixer: Ms Leather's friend claimed that Jason Weiner approached the issue as if it was not his first time cleaning up Anthony's mess - again a claim the sibling has denied . Coming clean: Anthony Weiner, seen here at a food center on Thursday, said that he sexted with a total of 'six to ten' women, both before and after his resignation from Congress . He became a close friend and confidante of the girl he describes as ‘beautiful and extremely intelligent.’ ‘I was initially shocked by what she told me and showed me,’ he admitted, recalling Leathers’ revelations to him which began that April and carried over into May. According to Mr Colegiovanni the conversations between Leathers and Weiner were about politics at first but steadily grew more sexual in nature. He said: ‘He offered her a condo in Chicago. He offered to pay for it. He offered to help her move. He said “I’m huge” referring to his muscles indicating he could help her move furniture.’ Eager: Ms Leathers first struck up a conversation with Weiner about his politics but their chats quickly turned sexual and graphic . Buying her off: Weiner allegedly said that he would get her a condo in Chicago where they could meet for trysts in person, as well as lining up a placement on a Politico panel in exchange for her deleting their messages . He continued: ‘I believe that this condo in Chicago was to be nothing more than a sex den for Anthony Weiner so he could show up and have his way with her and go back to his wife and pretend he’s like a happy family man.’ Sydney idolized this man, Mr Colegiovanni explained. He said: ‘She told me in our conversations that she thought she was in love with him and the way it was described to me she slowly developed a disdain for him in her mind.’ She thought he was ‘a righteous man’ he added who just liked younger women but ‘as the relationship unfolded and became more graphic and just about sex that changed.’ He claimed that Weiner called Leathers to talk about sex or have phone sex ‘every single day for six months.’ Continuing on: In spite of the repeated calls for him to drop out of the New York City mayor's race- and the fact he has dropped down to second place- Weiner refuses to give up . Sydney expressed increasing disdain for Weiner in May as he stepped up his campaign with the promotion of his Keys to the City programme. Leathers contacted Mr Colegiovanni to tell him she felt ‘disgusted’ by Weiner: ‘She told me that Antonhy Weiner had contacted her one week after his last big mea culpa in public saying how sorry he was for his mistakes and how his wife was standing by him and he had changed and by her disclosing that to me, it makes perfect sense because it was during the time the relationship was ongoing and shows to me that all he is saying now is a lie.’ Leathers, now 23 but she was 22 when they had their relationship, spoke out to Inside Edition for the first time since her identity was revealed to say that she was truly in love with the disgraced former Congressman. She believed the feelings to be mutual, but now she is 'disgusted by him'. Leathers told how she was initially attracted to Weiner because of his politics but now she has seen another side of him. 'He's not who I thought he was,' she said. Not listening to the numbers: A poll taken after the scandal showed that Weiner lost his lead in the race and slipped from first place to second by a significant margin, leaving City Council speaker Chris Quinn in the lead . She said that both she and Weiner said that they loved each other during their virtual romance, and Indiana-based Leathers has previously said that he offered to secure a condo for her in Chicago so that they could meet for trysts beyond the computer screen. When asked what she would like to say to him now, she responded: 'Stop lying, stop embarrassing his wife, and get help.' A preview of her interview with Inside Edition was released shortly after Weiner held a press conference on Thursday afternoon where he disclosed an approximate break down of his sexting timeline, just hours after the latest poll revealed he has lost his front-runner lead in the New York City mayoral race. When asked to clarify how many of those relationships started after he resigned from Congress in June 2011, he said: 'I don't believe more than three'. By his side: Huma Abedin revealed on Tuesday that she was aware of his indiscretions 'before and after' his resignation and they decided to launch his mayoral campaign . Today has not been good in terms of any numbers for Weiner, as the first poll since the Leathers revelation shows that he has been bumped out of the lead in the mayoral race. His drop in the polls comes as Weiner confirmed he had virtual relationships with three women after his 2011 resignation from Congress and between six and ten similar situations prior to leaving office. The first poll conducted after his relationship with then-22-year-old Sydney Leather was revealed just came out Thursday afternoon and has City Council Speaker Christine Quinn leading with 25 per cent of the Democratic vote. Weiner comes in second place with only 16 per cent- down from his earlier 26 per cent lead from a different poll that measured the public's thinking the week preceding the Tuesday revelations. In addition to taking away his lead, the release of naked photos and explicit sex chats have driven up his unfavorability rating, bringing him up to an 'all-time high' of 55 per cent. By comparison, his unfavorables were only at 36 per cent in June.","Jason Weiner has denied claims that he contacted Sydney Leathers .

"Changes: Education Secretary Michael Gove said the Church of England will help raise educational standards in Britain's schools . The Church of England could be given the power to run thousands of secular state schools after agreeing a landmark deal with the Department of Education. The Church will be forced to preserve the character of non-faith schools and community schools joining a Church of England academy chain would not have to change its admissions policy, religious education lessons or employment terms for teachers, according to The Times newspaper. Bishops will also have the power to appoint governors at the schools. But the move has been criticised by secular groups, who said the decision would irreversibly increase religious influence over state schools. Keith Porteous Wood, of the National . Secular Society, told The Times: 'This will surreptitiously bring the . education system under religious control. 'It will lead to the further . alienation of school children who are from non-religious or religiously . unconcerned families. 'Despite now being the majority, they . are becoming increasingly disadvantaged in admissions and by the growing . religionisation of publicly-funded schools. 'Once schools have been taken over by . religious interests, it will be almost impossible to ever bring them . back under community control.' Education Secretary Michael Gove praised the standards and popularity of church schools during a seminar at Lambeth Palace yesterday and urged a continuing partnership with the Church. In a statement Mr Gove said: 'We would not have so many great state schools in this country without the Church of England. 'I know the Church does a wonderful job helping to raise educational standards and in providing a safe and loving environment for hundreds of thousands of children. 'However, there is much more we can do together. I want the Church to recover the spirit which infused its educational mission in Victorian times and support more new schools - especially academies and free schools - to bring educational excellence to the nation's poorest children.' Approximately one million children currently attend Church of England schools. Mission: The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said the move would help the church 'transform every part of our society' There are 4,484 Church of England primary and middle schools, a quarter of the total, and 193 secondary schools. The . Bishop of Oxford, the Right Rev John Pritchard, who leads education . policy within the Church, believes small village primary schools will . want to join academy trusts led by its schools to secure their future, . and promised they would be 'safe with us', The Times said. Bishop . Pritchard said: 'This will be a way for them to have the security of a . larger body with mutual support, with resources that are much more . extensive.' He added: . 'Dioceses have the privilege and opportunity to put local church and . local school into the same box, as it were, and say that's where the . mission of the Church lies.' The . bishop said Mr Gove had set the Church a challenge to 'raise our game', . which 'echoes our own determination to make a real step change in the . way we serve our communities, working to the highest standards'. Bishop . Pritchard said: 'I think people may not realise the significance of . what looks like a small technical change but actually allows the mutual . support, the drawing together of resources, experiments in . collaboration. 'It allows a whole lot more and it will enhance the educational experience of millions of children.' The . Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev Justin Welby, said the vision . for church schools would 'continue our mission of transforming every . part of our society'. 'It is obviously true that good schools help produce an educated workforce,' the Archbishop said. 'But . the Christian vision is a far greater one. It is about setting a . framework for children as they learn, which enables them to be confident . when faced with the vast challenges that our rapidly changing culture . brings to us.' Secular groups have expressed concern about the extent of religious influence the move would allow. Rabbi Dr Jonathan Romain, chairman of the Accord Coalition, which campaigns for admissions and recruitment in state schools to be free from religious discrimination, said: 'Despite the positive aspects of church schools, those that select pupils on the basis of their faith are not only guilty of discrimination, but also help to fragment society. 'A tolerant pluralist society can only be created by having tolerant pluralist schools where children of all backgrounds grow up and interact together. 'If Michael Gove really wants church schools to recover the spirit which infused the Church's educational mission in Victorian times then he must make sure that church schools are not permitted to segregate and divide, but are made open and suitable for all in their respective local communities.'","Education Secretary Michael Gove agrees deal with the Church .

"The founder of the Paris ice cream brand beloved of the city's international tourists, Raymond Berthillon, has died at the age of 90. A visit to the Ile Saint Louis in the heart of Paris and a stone's throw from Notre Dame is on many a tourists' itinerary, partly for the architecture, the gift shopping, and the chance to take pictures of the cathedral, but also because it is the home of Berthillon ice cream.

"Just three days into life and little Prince George is already having the same effect on sales of baby-themed paraphernalia as his mother has on fashion. The aden + anais bird-decorated muslin wrap he was wrapped in by his parents upon leaving the Lindo Wing has already sold out, and now the small, family-run Nottingham-based firm behind his white Merino wool christening shawl admit they, too, have been inundated by orders.

Scroll down for video . The GH Hurt & Son Ltd shawl in which baby Prince George was wrapped is exactly the same as the one Prince William was swaddled in by his mother Diana 31 years ago . Tiny George was kept cosy and warm inside the shawl, which is made from super-fine Merino wool .

"A mother left unable to walk or talk after suffering a massive stroke has defied the odds to complete a university degree - by blinking. Dawn Faizey Webster was left with locked-in syndrome after the attack in 2003, two weeks after her son Alexander was born. The condition is where a patient is fully-aware and . awake - but cannot move or communicate verbally due to complete paralysis . of nearly all muscles in the body, except for the eyes. Incredibly, the former teacher, then 30, discovered she could still communicate through her eyes and tiny head movements. Dawn Faizey Webster (pictured left aged 27, in 2000, three years before falling ill) suffered a massive stroke in 2003, two weeks after her son Alexander was born . Ms Faizey Webster, now 42, was left with locked-in syndrome after the stroke. She has now defied the odds to complete a degree, thanks to a specialised laptop that translates her eye movements into text . Ms Faizey Webster (left in 2000 at her teacher training graduation from Wolverhamptom University and right on her wedding day), had been suffering high blood pressure during her pregnancy which preceded the stroke . She has now achieved a 2:2 degree in Ancient History and written an autobiography - all thanks to a  specialised laptop that translates her eye movements into text. Living at her parents home in Rugeley, Staffordshire, she began her degree in 2008, determined not to be beaten by the condition. And finishing . the Open University qualification has been no mean feat as her fastest writing pace of 50 words per hour has meant each three hour exam . has taken three weeks. Ms Faizey Webster, now 42, worked three-hours a day on the degree, nudging buttons either side of . her head to move the cursor on the screen and blinking to register the . letters. Six years on, she has completed the course with honours and is now . hoping to tackle a Masters in History of Art. Ms Faizey Webster said: 'When I passed my degree, I was so pleased and proud of myself. 'I had achieved my goal that I had for six years been striving for. 'No matter . what obstacles were in my way, such as getting pneumonia twice and other . lesser illnesses, I was determined to reach my goal. 'When I first had my stroke, I realised I would not be able to do anything physical. 'I then decided to use the thing that had not been affected and that was my brain. After the stroke, she disovered she could still communicate through her eyes and tiny head movements - and embarked on a degree in Ancient History . Six years on, and with each three-hour exam taking three weeks, she has graduated with a 2:2. Ms Faizey Webster's parents and full-time carers, Alec and Shirley, say they are delighted with her achievement . 'I felt I needed to prove to myself and to others that I was still me, Dawn.' She added: '[My computer] is my lifeline. Never did I imagine when I got pregnant with Alexander that my life would turn out like this.' Her problems began when she was rushed to hospital at 26 weeks pregnant in and was diagnosed potentially fatal pre-eclampsia - a pregnancy condition associated with high blood pressure. Over the next six days her health deteriorated, until her tiny baby had to be delivered by emergency caesarean weighing just 1lb 8oz. A week later Ms Faizey Webster returned home - still suffering high blood pressure - but was told she would be fine. But another week on, her high blood pressure triggered a stroke. Recalling the day she suffered the attack, she said: 'When I woke up that morning I immediately knew something was terribly wrong. I felt dizzy and faint. 'I had pins and needles in my right side and when I went to speak, my voice was horribly slurred. 'The last thing I remember properly is my mum, Shirley, saying: ""Squeeze my hand if you are able"", because by that stage I couldn't speak. Ms Faizey Webster (left, 29, and right, aged 24, at a christening) had been a keen traveller before the stroke . The now 42-year-old at Corfe castle in Dorset with her son Alexander. She is now hoping to tackle a Masters in History of Art . She said . she was vaguely aware of a tracheostomy tube going into her neck to help . her breathe and a tube being put into her nose. 'I . could hear traffic going by [and remember] a nurse washed my hair.' But . was was missing, crucially, was her ability to speak. 'My mind screamed that my brain was fine. But as I couldn't speak, no one could hear me shouting that inside my paralysed body, my brain was still alive,' she said. 'Simon [her now ex-husband], my parents and older brother Mark visited daily. Over . the following week, she drifted in and out of consciousness but was . unable to move or talk. Her condition got so bad her eye muscles even . were paralysed. She listened, motionless, while her family discussed her condition and doctors told her husband to prepare for the worst. Locked-in syndrome is a condition in which a patient is fully-aware and awake but cannot move or communicate verbally due to complete paralysis of nearly all muscles in the body, except for the eyes. Total locked-in syndrome is a version of locked-in syndrome where the eyes are paralysed too. It can be caused by a traumatic brain injury, a brain stem stroke or medication overdose. There is no cure for locked-in syndrome, nor is there a standard course of treatment. A therapy called functional neuromuscular stimulation, which uses electrodes to stimulate muscle reflexes, may help activate some paralysed muscles. Several devices to help communication are available. Other treatment is symptomatic and supportive. 'They would talk to me, talk to one another and to the nurses,' recalls Ms Faizey Webster. 'But all I could do was lie there hopelessly watching them, listening for snippets of news about how Alexander was. 'For long hours, I lay staring up at a blank ceiling, living for visiting hours when at least I could hear my family's chatter. 'Inside I cried, but no tears came out. When people saw me, they had no idea I was as wide awake as ever.' No . matter how hard she tried, Ms Faizey Webster was unable to move her fingers to tell . people she was still alive and was left staring at the ceiling as the . weeks passed. A . breakthrough came when she was finally able to blink, and let her . father Alec, who had been at her bedside the entire time, know she was . still inside her broken body. 'My dad asked me if I could hear him - and told me to blink if I could. [When] I blinked, he jumped up in shock.' She . was soon fitted with the laptop that allowed her to communicate, but . her joy was short lived as just months later her husband Simon walked . out. 'When Simon left me it was a crushing blow; I had always believed we married in sickness and in health,' said Ms Faizey Webster. 'I was sure if it had been the other way round - and this had happened to him - I would always have been there for him. 'He . later wrote a letter to me saying he had cried about what we had lost . together. He had found our cottage somehow haunted and changed without . me. 'He saw us both as victims, alone and confused. But I felt betrayed.' Ms Faizey Webster said: 'When I passed my degree, I was so pleased and proud of myself. I had achieved my goal that I had for six years been striving for' Speaking yesterday about his daughter's progess, Ms Faizey Webster's father, who is her full-time carer along with wife Shirley, 75, said they were 'over the moon' with her progress. The 80-year-old said: 'It's amazing she has managed to do this considering her condition. We are so proud of her. She worked so hard to get there. 'Before her stroke she used to love travelling. Egypt was one of her favourite places to visit because of her love of history. 'She lived a very active life. She used to like walking and going to National Trust properties up and down the country. 'It was heartbreaking to see her go through all of this. But she hasn't given up. She has her bad days, as anyone in her situation would, but she is determined to keep going. 'We have to look after her 24/7. We took her and Alexander to Warwick Castle the other day, there wasn't access for her into the Great Hall so when we came back she contacted the castle to say there should be better access for people in wheelchairs. 'She is very proactive about things like that.

"A Transformer-style ‘flying car’ being developed by an Arizona company could soon spell the end of runways. The company’s vision is to build a vehicle with four rotors that allow it to take to the air anywhere like a helicopter - and then switch to fly like a normal plane. While this ‘SkyCruiser’ vehicle is still some way from development, the technology could soon become a reality in a functioning prototype dubbed the ‘SkyProwler’. Scroll down for video . The SkyProwler (artist's impression pictured) has four horizontal propellers that allow it to perform vertical take-offs and landings, and to hover in mid-air . The SkyProwler has four horizontal propellers that allow it to perform vertical take-offs and landings, and to hover in mid-air. ‘This opens up flying to a much larger range of possible terrains, from backyards and rough fields, to a boat on the sea,’ the company writes on its Kickstarter campaign. Users can instruct the aircraft to retract its landing gear and pull its four rotor props into the sides of its body. Users can instruct the aircraft to retract its landing gear and pull its four rotor props into the sides of its body . Pictured on the left is a prototype flown on April, and the right image shows what the current design looks like . In this mode, the craft is powered by two rear props allowing it to cover bigger distances at 83 mph (134 km/h). For slow-speed flight, they craft’s weight can be cut by temporarily removing its wings and tail. It will then travel at 35mph (56 km/h). According to Krossblade, flight time ranges from 24 minutes when it is in quadcopter mode to 40 minutes when flying fixed-wing. Nose cones on the drone can also be changed, allowing it to carry different gadgets such as a HD camera, according to a report in Gizmag. In ‘hornet configuration’, without the tail and wings, the craft has a range of 14 miles (22km) and in ‘blade configuration’ it can travel for 43 miles (69km). The SkyProwler is controlled using a radio remote control unit that comes with a live-streaming video screen. Users also have the option of removing the GPS module from the drone, and carrying it with them so that it acts as a homing beacon. The patent pending switchblade mechanism forms the basis of the transformation of SkyCruiser and SkyProwler. Airplanes need to fly fast and to fly fast you need to be as aerodynamically clean as possible. That's why airplanes are long and narrow, somewhat drop-shaped and with as few 'things' sticking out as possible. For vertical take-off and landing on the other hand, you need to be the opposite of aerodynamic. The more things you have sticking out producing lift (think of the extreme of a parachute for example) the easier it is to hover. The craft can switch between plane and quadcopter mode with a special 'switchblade' This is one of the main reasons that helicopters which a great at hover, are not very good at forward flight, being slow as well as needing a lot of fuel. The switchblade mechanism transforms an aircraft from the aerodynamically clean airplane configuration to the VTOL configuration, which features a number of rotors that together have a large rotor disc area that is ideal for hovering at low power. According to Krossblade, flight time ranges from 24 minutes when it is in quadcopter mode to 40 minutes when flying fixed-wing. Pictured are the craft's key features . The SkyProwler is controlled using a radio remote control unit that comes with a live-streaming video screen . A ready-to-fly package is currently being advertised on Kickstarter for $899. Shipping is estimated for July, if the Kickstarter is able to raise enough funds. The SkyProwler is based on the larger concept of the SkyCruiser transforming vehicle, which was unveiled last year. In normal flight, the SkyCruiser uses two 150 bhp electric motors in the tail, but when switching from horizontal to vertical flight, a set of four 'switchblade' rotor arms fold out from the fuselage to take the load. There are four 80 bhp electric motors running the four main rotors, plus another four 10 bhp rotors to providing stability in crosswinds. According to Krossblade, the smaller rotors can accelerate faster than the larger ones, so they can respond faster to sudden gusts. On the ground, the 9.5 m (31 ft) wing span can be stowed away, and electric motors mounted in the wheels drive the craft along at 75 mph (112 kph) - although be warned, it is 8.4 m (27.5 ft) long.

"The man known as ‘Eoin Rogers’ in these parts is determined to make a name for himself by ending his run of dismal form and showing New Zealand that England really can play one-day cricket. The slip of the tongue from Wellington’s English mayor Celia Wade-Brown somehow summed up Eoin Morgan’s anonymity during a horrid spell when he has not stayed at the crease long enough for anyone to take note of his name. Morgan is not one to take offence at the mayor’s faux pas - ‘I’ve been called a lot worse,’ he smiled on Wednesday - but he knows how important it would be for him to make an indelible impression on New Zealand on Friday (1am GMT). ‘I’d love you to explain it because I don’t understand it,’ said Morgan of his run of four ducks in his last five innings. ‘I try to keep things simple. You don’t look any further than what’s in front of you and I’ve done that but it hasn’t worked. Eoin Morgan is determined to turn his recent lean run of form around when England face New Zealand . Morgan remains confident despite scoring four ducks in his last five innings in one-dayers in Australia . ‘I believe it will work and when it does hopefully I can cash in and make it either a match-winning performance or build on somebody else’s. I’ve certainly done the same things I’ve been doing since the start of the tour and I began it with a hundred. That’s only five games ago.’ It must seem like an eternity to Morgan despite his relaxed persona. He does not look short of confidence but he knows how erosive it can be for a captain to struggle having succeeded one who was struggling in Alastair Cook. ‘I think the fact I’ve been through bad patches before has helped,’ said Morgan, who lost his Test place three years ago when his technique collapsed against Pakistan. He is not the only one who needs a performance at the Westpac Stadium in a game where England need a vast improvement from their capitulation at the hands of Australia. Last summer England’s Test form dramatically improved after a dismal start to the summer when the more experienced players found their feet and Morgan called on those around him to deliver now. Morgan says going through bad patches in the past, including losing his Test place, are an advantage . Morgan called on his fellow senior players to deliver as England push to turn their fortunes around . Before his run of two runs in five innings, Morgan reminded reporters again of his 121 in Sydney . ‘Our senior players will need to stand up,’ said Morgan when looking ahead to the challenge of facing what looks like a formidable New Zealand side. ‘We didn’ t do it at the MCG which was disappointing. Guys like myself, Jimmy, Broady and Belly need to make contributions in order to make the young guys feel comfortable within themselves. ‘There is a sense of frustration. These first two games in particular are great practice for the later stages. If we can get wins under our belt against good opposition it can breed confidence for later in the tour.’ England might want to think about getting to those later stages first if they are convincingly beaten again. Another defeat would crank up the pressure before they play Scotland in Christchurch on Monday in what would then be a game where England could not afford any slip ups. At least Morgan had one bit of good news in his recruitment by Sunrisers Hyderabad of the Indian Premier League this week, where he will play alongside Kevin Pietersen, Ravi Bopara and David Warner. England's experienced members including James Anderson (left) and Stuart Broad must take the lead . A big knock from the likes of Ian Bell would help 'make the young guys feel comfortable within themselves' But even that is not without controversy because, as revealed by Charles Sale in Sports Agenda, it means Morgan will miss England’s one-day international against Ireland on May 8 because of a clash with the IPL. And he had said earlier on this tour that the IPL would not effect his England commitments. ‘The national selector (James Whitaker) and managing director (Paul Downton) have allowed guys who have got picked up in the IPL to miss that game in order to expose themselves to opportunities and learn more about their game.’ But surely the England captain is a different case? ‘No, I don’t think it is,’ insisted Morgan. ‘If you’re being a little short-sighted it might do but I think in the longer term it will serve me well.’ Well, call me myopic but I think that is wrong. Yes, the scheduling of the match in Dublin is ridiculous, straight after England’s Caribbean tour, but the captain should be with his team. For now that issue can wait because Morgan might not even be England captain by then if his side go out in the first round of this World Cup.","England skipper Eoin Morgan remains confident despite poor run of form .

"Oliver Letwin is the latest politician to be caught editing his own Wikipedia profile after his office deleted a reference to the fact he is Jewish. Cabinet Office Minister Mr Letwin confirmed that one of his staff removed a line on his profile that listed his religion as ‘Judaism’. Staff said the reference was deleted two weeks ago because, although his family background is Jewish, he is now an atheist. Caught out: A member of Oliver Letwin's office has admitted to editing his Wikipedia page . Computers within the House of Commons were also used to edit Mr Letwin’s profile on the online encyclopedia to play down a negative press story, according to investigative website Exaro – although his office denied making those. Changes were made to Wikipedia’s description of a bizarre incident in 2011 in which Mr Letwin was photographed dumping sensitive documents into bins near Whitehall. The profile was later updated from within the Commons to add: ‘Enquiries made by the Information Commissioner’s Office found Oliver did not dispose of any government documents.’ But the change was made in advance of the formal publication of the findings. The amendment, while true, did not mention that Mr Letwin had disposed of constituents’ documents, failing to protect their confidentiality. When asked how the change could have been made ahead of the official release of the findings, a spokesman said: ‘I have spoken to Oliver and this has not come from our office. We are at a loss to explain it. Oliver is very keen to find out.’ Another change to Mr Letwin’s Wikipedia page, this time from a computer outside the Commons, removed a reference to the fact that he was lampooned on the BBC’s TV comedy quiz programme Have I Got News For You over dumping the documents.","One of his staff removed a line that listed his religion as 'Judaism'

"A member of Nicki Minaj's team was killed, and another man critically injured, after a stabbing in Philadelphia in the early morning hours of Wednesday. De'Von Pickett, 29, Minaj's tour manager, died after being rushed to a local hospital, while Eric Parker, 27, remains in critical condition. Minaj shared the news on Twitter, writing; 'Two members of my team were stabbed last night in Philly. One was killed. They had only been there for two days rehearsing for the tour.' She also called the incident 'another senseless act of violence that took the life of a great guy.' Scroll down for video . De'Von Pickett (left), Nicki Minaj's tour manager, was stabbed to death last night, while Eric Parker (right), 27, remains in critical condition . Minaj (above) shatred the tragic news on Twitter . According to NBC 10, the argument began inside Che Bar & Grill in Philadelphia’s West Oak Lane neighborhood. 'We believe that both of the victims, as well as the perpetrator, were all inside of this bar and that’s when an argument started,' said Chief inspector Scott Small. Small said that they expect Parker to survive. And while the incident was possibly caught on camera, the man responsible for the stabbings is still at large, having been last seen driving off in a gray Buick LeSabre. He is believed to be around 30 years old. Rihanna paid tribute to Pickett, who she previously worked with, on Instagram (above) Pickett worked on Rihanna's Glow In the Dark Tour (both pictured above) Pickett also worked with K. Michelle (both above) on her first tour . According to witnesses, the stabbing had to do with a recently fired employee, though police have yet to verify that story. Minaj's tour begins next month in Europe in support of her new album The Pinkprint. Rihanna also paid tribute to Pickett, who previously worked on her tour, writing; 'Can't believe this is true! one of the nicest, coolest, funniest people I've ever met and toured with! We had so much fun together!!! Sad to lose a beautiful spirit like yours#RIPDayDay.' Rapper Fabolous also paid tribute, writing; 'My heart is heavy right now... God opened my eyes this morning at 9:49am. For some reason at that time I woke up thinking about both of these guys. They both work with me, but I couldn't figure out why they were in my mind at 1st wake up. Wasn't sure if I had a dream & they were in it or just some wake up & process things type shit.. But at 10:04 my brother hit me & told me... 'My friend died & my friend Eric Parker is in critical condition in the hospital fighting for his life. I am still in shock & don't want to believe this. And it hurts even more knowing how good these two dudes are. How hard these guys work. And how loyal they are to whoever they are down with & each other. Please send Eric Parker your blessings & a prayer for him to pull thru. 'And RIP to the fallen soldier Day Day.

"There are few things as annoying as leaving your house in a hurry, getting into your car and preparing to drive off - only to realise that the inconsiderate parking of someone else has blocked you in. An actor and comedian has channeled that feeling of frustration in an online video poking fun at a YouTube blogger who moaned that his car was towed away. Joey Graceffa ranted to his two million plus YouTube subscribers about having to pay a $200 fine to retrieve his car after it was impounded because he was blocking someone's drive 'just a little bit'. But Nate Clark's witty riposte is sure to put the young 'vlogger' in his place - or at least make sure he thinks twice about where he parks his car in future. Scroll down for video . Riposte: Actor and comedian Nate Clark has posted a funny video on YouTube poking fun at a teen with more than two million followers on the site who ranted about having his car towed away . Rant: Joey Graceffa complained about having to pay $200 to retrieve his car to his two million YouTube followers . Clark was posting in response to two videos posted on the site by Graceffa, which show him finding that his Toyota Prius has been taken from a Los Angeles street and then complaining about the fine he had to pay to get his wheels back. Directly addressing Joey, the comedian tells the camera that it was his driveway that the car was blocking. Despite his friends' encouragement to post a video online mocking Graceffa's own videos, he thought that might be a little cruel. But he claims to have changed his mind having seen Joey's rants. In a five point lecture, aimed at explaining why he had the car towed away and explaining that his driveway was more than 'just a little bit' blocked, Clark shows a picture of a blue Prius parked right across a driveway. He points out to Joey, who complained in one of his videos that there were no parking restriction signs in the road where his car was towed, that he had considered putting a sign in front of his drive asking people not to park there but adds 'that would be insane'. Not 'just a little bit' overparked: As part of his response, Nate Clark even posted a picture of a blue Toyota Prius parked across his driveway . In response to Joey's suggestion that the owner of the driver put his 'fat a**' car' on a diet so that he could've squeezed his car out - Clark points out that his car is a Volkswagen Golf, which 'at 70.3 inches wide is one of the slimmest cars out there'. Joey also remarked in his videos that whoever towed his car away is a 'slut'. But Nate responds: 'That's just not true man, I wasn't trying to move my car so I could meet up with some sexual rendezvous, I just wanted to move my car because that's my right.' And finally, Clark warns Joey not to leave his Federal Tax Return on the passenger seat of his car, joking about how much he earned from YouTube in 2012 and how much he owes the taxman. Annoyed: Joey, pictured in one of his videos, is seen complaining that there were no parking restriction signs on the Los Angeles road . He ends his video with the warning: 'Next time you park in front of a driveway, you might want to apologise to them in your YouTube video because it's probably 100 per cent your fault.' Despite Clark's claims that he had the car towed away, it's fair to say that there's every chance that the video is tongue-in-cheek. But even if the video is just a joke, that didn't stop some of Joey's more outspoken followers hitting back at Clark. One YouTube user commented: 'This annoying p**** has been waiting for an opportunity like this to grab views/subscribers. 'Joeys car was the best﻿ thing that happened to him - just look at the glee on his face! He's not worried about any of the points he's making; it's all look at me! Look at me!'","Joey Graceffa vented to his YouTube fans that his Toyota was towed away .

"Attempts were made on Wednesday  to dismiss Mo Farah’s astonishing Twitter row with Great Britain’s second best distance runner as a juvenile exchange between two athletes who really should know better. Others, however, saw it as the moment Farah allowed his mask to slip; when we were suddenly given a view of the double Olympic champion that those around him have long tried to conceal. Andy Vernon does need to take some responsibility for provoking the runner he finished second to in last summer’s European Championship 10,000m final. He has a bit of form for being outspoken on social media and he questioned the quality of the field assembled for Farah’s attempt at the world indoor two mile record in Birmingham this weekend, suggesting it was not a proper race and branding it a ‘joke’. Mo Farah (right) and Andy Vernon, who finished one-two at the European Championships, have clashed in a Twitter stoush that has seen many in athletics offended by Farah's comments . Farah celebrates his victory over Vernon for the Men's 10,000m European titles in Zurich in August 2014 . But the response shocked even Vernon, who suddenly found himself being publicly branded an ‘embarrassment’ and someone Taylor Swift would beat. ‘ComeBackWhenYouWinSomething Decent,’ Farah added, which was probably the remark that offended the wider athletics community most. On Wednesday Vernon summed up the feelings of all those athletes who strive to be successful in the absence of the incredible talent Farah possesses. ‘If he thinks I am an embarrassment, then what does he think about the rest of us?’ said Vernon. ‘It came across very arrogant from him.’ Others were just as offended. One Olympian told me Farah had ‘crossed a line’. Another said Farah had been ‘hugely disrespectful to fellow athletes’. Vernon is a major championship medallist after all; a national cross-country champion too. Decent? ‘I feel it’s harsh on everyone else,’ added Vernon. It’s certainly harsh on Vernon, when he trains every bit as hard as Farah but just lacks that bit of quality that separates the very best from the very good. Over the past five years he has earned between £15,000 and £20,000 a year in pursuit of the two European medals he won in Zurich last summer. He has had to do other jobs to make ends meet and now has a stake in a refurbishment company. His earnings amount to a fraction of the money Farah commands. Farah will make more on Saturday than Vernon earns in a year. Finding anyone brave enough to discuss a situation that embarrassed the sport proved difficult. Farah’s representatives did not respond to messages while his sponsors at Nike said they did not comment on the ‘personal accounts’ of their athletes . They might pay Farah a fortune to inspire people to buy their running shoes but the moment he rubbished the efforts of all runners out there pounding the streets they essentially ran for cover. UK Athletics declined to comment too. So credit to Dave Moorcroft, one time 5,000m world record holder and former UK Athletics chief executive, for giving his view and recognising that this needs to be addressed when it can be damaging, not just to a British sporting icon but to British sport. These days Moorcroft is a central figure in trying to inspire people to participate in sport. He is the director of sport for the Olympic legacy project, Join In. He was dismayed by the row between two athletes he has known since they were competing as youngsters. Vernon tweeted that the field running with Farah in his bid for an indoor world record in Birmingham was a joke . The response ‘ComeBackWhenYouWinSomething Decent’ from Farah offended many in athletics . ‘For me it highlights the danger of Twitter and social media,’ said Moorcroft. ‘Neither of them should be disrespecting the other. They should concentrate on running.’ Moorcroft said he winced at Farah’s comments. ‘Yes,’ he said. ‘I’ve watched them grow up and I’m proud of how well they’ve done. Mo’s got nothing to prove. I wouldn’t care if my granny was against him. He’s still a joy to watch.’ As Vernon said, it is no secret that races are sometimes organised to give the paying punters what they want. In this case a Farah victory and the Mobot celebration they all like to mimic. Saturday’s race is one Farah should win, given the field will be populated by a 40-year-old Bernard Lagat and runners only strong enough to either act as pacemakers or also-rans. But it will not be easy when his objective is to set his first world record. Vernon might have overlooked that point but Farah also ignored the fact that his rival had only just returned to running after serious injury when he teased him for failing to secure a place in the race. Curiously there does not appear to be any history of spats between them. Vernon has a picture of him with Farah after their European triumph on his Facebook and Twitter pages, and in Zurich last summer they would dine together. There is no history of spats between Great Britain's two best male long distance runners . Farah will earn more than Vernon does in a year when he runs in Birmingham this weekend . But some observers have noted a change in Farah in recent years. If he was delighted to celebrate with team-mate Chris Thompson after a European one-two at 10,000m in 2010, there seemed a reluctance on Farah’s part to pose for photographs with Vernon in Zurich. After such extraordinary levels of success since that breakthrough season five years ago, it certainly looked like Farah was no longer prepared to share the limelight. If true, it will not necessarily be because he is being badly advised. His representatives look after Usain Bolt and he is a media dream. But some who know Farah would say he has not coped so well with life in the spotlight, responding with arrogance and aggression when he needs to recognise that with fame comes responsibility as well as the kind of attention he often seems to resent. He can be difficult to handle, sometimes even throwing the occasional tantrum. It has been noted that it may not help that his wife, Tania, takes care of some of his PR when the emotional attachment she obviously has can cloud her judgment. On Wednesday it was suggested she sometimes Tweets for her husband. In fact, journalists once asked Farah about something he had tweeted after a race. ‘Did I say that?’ he asked, completely oblivious to what was on his Twitter page. On Friday, in Birmingham, he will be asked about the comments made this week. The important thing now is how he responds.","Andy Vernon and Mo Farah engaged in a spat on Twitter this week .

"Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge is ready to lead the quest for a cup double as he prepares to make his long-awaited European debut for the club. Sturridge missed the whole of Liverpool’s doomed Champions League campaign because of thigh and calf problems, with his personal low coming when he had to sit as a frustrated spectator for the clash with Real Madrid in the Bernabeu last November. He also missed the Europa League ties against Zenit St Petersburg in February 2013, having already played in the Champions League for Chelsea during that season, but ahead of the round-of-32 clash with Besiktas, the England striker has no barriers in front of him. Former Chelsea and Manchester City man Daniel Sturridge is yet to make his European debut for Liverpool . But Sturridge looks set to make his long-awaited debut on Thursday against Besiktas . All the information ahead of Thursday's game . Brendan Rodgers is eager for his side to attack the Europa League and prove that their performance in the Champions League was a blip. And having Sturridge primed to lead his attack means Liverpool will be a different proposition in the coming months. ‘I’ve waited such a long time to play this game,’ said Sturridge, who has scored two goals in five appearances since launching his comeback. ‘It has been very difficult to sit and watch those games in the Champions League without being part of it — very, very hard. ‘But I have to be positive and look forward. I just want to get out there and play now, and enjoy it and hopefully have some success with the team. ‘It wasn’t just that game in the Bernabeu that was difficult; every game was hard to watch, every single game. ‘I was watching (the final games) from America, hoping and praying we’d go through, but it wasn’t to be. That’s football. Sometimes you don’t get what you want. But that doesn’t make us any less determined in the Europa League. We want to win it. We want success.’ Liverpool’s fortunes have transformed since they last played in Europe before Christmas. Sturridge and Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers at the pre-match press conference . Sturridge shares a joke during the press conference on Wednesday afternoon . The England striker has been in good form since returning from injury, scoring twice in five games . They are 90 minutes from an appearance at Wembley in the FA Cup semi-finals, well positioned to attack the top four in the Barclays Premier League and have ambitions to flourish in the Europa League. Rodgers is eager for his players to show themselves in a different light against Besiktas, whose arrival on Merseyside was delayed last night by adverse weather conditions in Istanbul. He is still vexed by Liverpool’s failure to perform as he had hoped in the biggest competition of all. ‘I was always hopeful we could still be in the Champions League at this stage and show our way of working,’ said Rodgers, who will have Raheem Sterling available after injury. ‘It was not to be but this is still a very good competition. ‘We will attack these games in this competition like we have in the last few months. It is a competition I would like to do really well in. Raheem Sterling (right) will be available for Liverpool after missing the last two games through injury .

"Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere has showed off his culinary skills after posting a picture of some homemade bruschetta on his official Instagram account. The 23-year-old was apparently very pleased with himself and triumphantly attached his name to the dish in the photo's caption along with the list of ingredients. His team-mate Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, however, was not especially supportive of Wilshere's endeavors and mocked him on Twitter, 'Have a day off will Ya!! Jack's bruschetta. Who you trying to impress geez?!!' Jack Wilshere shares an image of his homemade bruschetta on his official Instagram account . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain wasn't impressed with Wilshere's cooking . The Arsenal midfielder has been out with an ankle injury he sustained in November last year . Wilshere has been nursing an ankle injury since November last year, but is expected to make his return to The Gunners' first-team for their Premier League game with Crystal Palace on Saturday. He is under intense pressure to impress and return to form after recently being caught in the third smoking scandal of his career. Having initially been touted as a long-term successor to erstwhile Arsenal playmaker Cesc Fabregas during his early days at the club, thanks to a mixture of injuries, inconsistency and several off-field controversies, Wilshere has seen his stock drop significantly over the last few years. Indeed, there are some fans and pundits who suggest that it could be now or never for Wilshere to deliver for Arsenal, starting with the trip to Selhurst Park. After his latest smoking scandal, Wilshere is under intense pressure to perform well for The Gunners .","Jack Wilshere has made some homemade bruschetta .

"Brazilian right back Danilo netted a crucial penalty for Porto as the visitors fought back against Basle in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 clash, though the fixture was dominated by two decisions from referee Mark Clattenburg. Paraguayan midfielder Derlis Gonzalez opened the scoring at St Jakob-Park as Liverpool's conquerors looked set to take a narrow lead to Portugal, before Casemiro thought he had equalised for the visitors. However, English official Clattenburg took two minutes to disallow the goal, and then awarded Porto a penalty after Walter Samuel was adjudged to have handled in the box.

Goal: Danilo 79 (pen) Referee: Mark Clattenburg (England) Basle set themselves up as a team who first and foremost didn't want to concede, but scored with the first chance of the game in the 11th minute. Fabian Frei chipped a perfectly weighted ball over the Porto defence and found Gonzalez, who held off his marker and prodded the ball past the Porto goalkeeper. But the Paraguayan was involved in a heavy collision with Fabiano in his efforts, with the Porto stopper's knee making impact with his face. Basle lost their bite after the he went off injured in the 25th minute. Porto took their time to get going but began stringing some moves together and although the did not seriously test Tomas Vaclik before half-time, it was a different story after the break as they controlled the game. The visitors had a half-chance to level on the hour mark as they started to apply the pressure but Jackson Martinez was thwarted by the home defence as he was floored in the box while referee Clattenburg waved play-on, before Danilo sent the ball flying over the crossbar and into the stands. The away side continued to push and Cristian Tello had the ball in the back of the net 10 minutes before the break although the offside flag had already gone up. It looked as if Julen Lopetegui's men had got onto the scoresheet two minutes into the second half as Tello's corner found Maicon at the far post, whose header was punched out by Vaclik before the ball fell to the feet of Brazil midfielder Casemiro to volley home. But seconds later the goal was disallowed after a brief exchange of words between Clattenburg and his assistant, and the English referee ruled the goal out after saying the Porto players had impeded the goalkeeper in an offside position. Czech stopper Vaclik was forced to parry Tello's close-range shot out for a corner as the game approached the hour mark, while - five minutes later - Martinez came close to netting a leveller with a great chance but he fired too high with his close-range effort and instead found the roof of the net.

With just over 10 minutes remaining, Porto levelled through Danilo's penalty after former Inter defender Samuel went to ground in his own box and was unable to avoid handling the ball on the deck. Danilo made it look easy as he took the resulting spot-kick with a cool short run to fire into the bottom-left of the goal and beat the diving Vaclik as the visitors' pressure finally paid off. Both sides seemed content to play out for a draw in the end, though the Portuguese side are surely favourites.

"John Terry admits there have been no talks yet about extending his Chelsea contract beyond the end of the season. At 34, Terry is aware time is running out for him at the top level and wants to squeeze every drop from a campaign chasing three major trophies. He hopes to sign for another year under Jose Mourinho and is unconcerned that negotiations have not opened because he accepts the priority for Chelsea was to secure the long-term future of Eden Hazard. Chelsea captain John Terry admits the club haven't opened up talks with him over a new deal yet . The 34-year-old's (centre) current contract with the Blues expires at the end of the season . Terry (right) marshals his defence during their 1-1 draw away at PSG in the Champions League on Tuesday . ‘The club know my position,’ said Terry. ‘Hopefully, I know theirs and it will get done. No talks have happened yet between myself and the club but we both respect the position. ‘There’s more important players. Hazard’s one. For me, that was the most important for the club. Without anyone telling me that, I knew that was the first priority for them. Hopefully they’ll be knocking on the door soon.’ Hazard, 24, signed a five-and-a-half-year deal last week, making him the top earner at Stamford Bridge and keeping him from the clutches of Real Madrid, at least for now. The policy at Chelsea for players over 30 is to limit extensions to one year. Terry could secure a longer deal elsewhere and his contractual situation means he is free to talk to foreign clubs about a move. He could sign a pre-contract leading to a free transfer at the end of the season. But he is comfortable with Chelsea’s stance, having been through the same process last year, when he was linked with moves to Galatasaray and Monaco. And Mourinho has spoken in public to confirm he wants to keep his captain. Eden Hazard (left) signed a new five-year contract with Chelsea earlier in the month . The 24-year-old poses inside Stamford Bridge after signing his new deal with the club . ‘The first year, I was maybe a bit nervous and hoping and knocking on the door myself,’ said Terry. ‘But we had a good chat. I know their position and they know mine. I want to stay and hopefully my performances are showing that and they want to keep me. ‘I’ll be happy with one more year and then we’ll see how we go year by year. I’ve not got much choice.’ Terry  has spent his entire career at Chelsea and has been restored as the defensive bedrock of the team since Mourinho returned to west London. There is pressure from emerging players such as Kurt Zouma, but the captain promises to be one of the last survivors from his generation at the top of the English game. Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard plan to leave for the USA in May, Ashley Cole is in Italy and Rio Ferdinand has been unable to hold a regular place at QPR. Terry (right) has spent his entire career at Chelsea and has been reinvigorated since Jose Mourinho's return . ‘The way players like me, Stevie, Rio, Lamps, those kinds of player, have looked after ourselves in the last five or six years has helped us in our later careers, for sure,’ said Terry. ‘They’re a couple of years older than me. ‘It’s difficult when you see young boys come in like Kurt. He’s been a revelation since he came in. He’s young, fit, strong and hungry and it makes it even more difficult. We all want to play every game. Gaz (Gary Cahill) and Kurt have been fighting it out and it could be me (who’s dropped) any time. ‘It’s important to remain top of the league and everyone gets their game time. When Gaz plays he’s been great, when Kurt plays he’s been great, so it’s hard but we’re all rotating and there are enough games to share around. ‘I don’t want to rest. I’m coming to the end of my career, so it’s important I stay fit and play as much as I can.’ Terry also described young defender Kurt Zouma's impact on the team this season as a 'revelation'","John Terry's contract at Chelsea expires at the end of the season .
