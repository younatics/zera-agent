"(CNN) -- A man opens fire in a national park, killing a ranger who was attempting to stop him after he blew through a vehicle checkpoint. A second man is suspected in the stabbing deaths of four homeless men in Southern California. Both men, U.S. military veterans, served in Iraq -- and both, according to authorities and those who knew them, returned home changed men after their combat service. Iraq War vet could face death penalty . A coincidence -- two recent high-profile cases? Or a sign of an increase in hostile behavior as U.S. troops complete their withdrawal from Iraq, similar to that seen when U.S. troops returned home from the Vietnam War? ""You're going to see this more and more over the next 10 years,"" said Shad Meshad, founder of the National Veterans Foundation, who has been working with veterans since 1970. ""... There's a percentage that come back, depending on how much trauma and how much killing they're involved in, they're going to act out."" Margaret Anderson, a ranger at Washington state's Mount Rainier National Park, was shot to death on New Year's Day. Police believe Benjamin Colton Barnes, who served in Iraq from 2007 to 2009, was responsible for the shooting. After a manhunt, authorities found Barnes' body face down in a creek in the park. According to court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KIRO, the woman with whom Barnes was in a custody dispute said she believed he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from his deployment. Barnes was emotionally unstable, vindictive and anger-prone, the woman said, and owned many knives and guns. The woman said she was frightened to be in the same state with him, the documents said. In California, former Marine Cpl. Itzcoatl Campo is accused of stabbing four homeless men to death. According to the military, Campo was deployed to Iraq during 2008. A friend of his, who asked to be identified only as Brian, told CNN Monday that ""something happened"" after Campo returned from Iraq. ""He was a little bit more serious. It seemed like there was something on his mind,"" Brian said. ""He seemed really depressed and down, and things in his life weren't looking that well."" His father, Refugio Campo, told the Orange County Register that upon his return, his son began talking about things that ""didn't make any sense,"" like the end of the world. It's important to note, experts said, that the two cases represent the extreme end of a spectrum of behavior signifying difficulties faced by returning troops, and some experience little difficulty, if any. ""What we don't want to do is stigmatize veterans by saying they're walking time bombs,"" said Elspeth Ritchie, chief clinical officer for the Washington, D.C., Department of Mental Health and a former U.S. Army colonel. ""They're not."" But study after study has highlighted the struggles faced by troops returning home, including substance abuse, relationship problems, aggression or depression, she and others noted. Some may have trouble sitting still in college classes, Ritchie said. Others may react with aggression at a perceived threat, such as being pulled over for a traffic violation, Meshad said. Still others have trouble riding in or driving vehicles because they are used to the threat of IEDs (improvised explosive devices), or may react aggressively to a sudden move, even one by their spouse, he said. ""It's embedded in (the service member) to do that,"" Meshad said. ""It looks brutal, it is brutal, it's horrible, it's heinous, but they switch on like that because they haven't been switched off."" Suicide is also a growing problem. The Army reported a record-high number of suicides in July 2011, with the deaths of 33 active- and reserve-component service members categorized as suicides. While homicides by former troops aren't tracked, many of the dynamics leading to suicidal behavior are similar to those seen in murder-suicides or homicides, Ritchie said. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and others have made strides in addressing PTSD in veterans, the experts said. Other groups and resources, such as the Wounded Warrior Project, are also available. But many veterans have trouble seeking help, said Paul Ragan, an associate professor of psychiatry at Vanderbilt University who works with returning service members. ""Big boys don't cry,"" he said. Every veteran he works with in his clinic is married, he said. ""It's because their wives are the ones who helped bring them in."" ""I'm not seeing everybody out there,"" he said. ""I'm not seeing a random sampling of all the returning vets. I'm seeing the ones who make it in, and they make it in largely through the auspices of a loved one who helps get them over that hump. ... The heroes in my clinic are the wives who've learned to adjust and adapt."" Absent that support, some vets may not take that step, he said. One of PTSD's fundamental features, Ragan noted, is a lack of trust: in one's self, in others, in humans, ""that the world will give them a fair shake. ... There is this tremendous hurdle for them to overcome to get treatment."" Ragan and Meshad noted that people who are trained killers can have trouble switching out of that role after returning home. They come home ""full of war energy ... and it's hard for them to have a relationship with anybody other than somebody in your unit,"" Meshad said. ""Your unit is removed. You're now around a touchy-feely wife or girlfriend that you don't understand."" Combat veterans who may have killed or witnessed the deaths of women and children are plagued by guilt, which affects relationships with their own families, he said. Meshad said a significant effort to deprogram soldiers should be made before they leave the military. While the Marines do have a program, he said, many troops don't listen; those who do have said it's ""oversimplified."" Issues such as employment, education and housing must also be examined as part of an overall effort to support veterans, Ritchie said. ""The VA and the military can only do so much,"" Ritchie said. ""It really takes a nationwide effort and a local community effort ... this is an issue that's not going to go away. It's going to be with us for 10, 20, 30 years.""","Veterans are accused of homicides in Washington and California .

"(CNN) -- ""It was an angry call,"" Seth MacFarlane said of the now-infamous phone call in which Jon Stewart lambasted him for ""Family Guy"" poking fun at the fact that ""The Daily Show"" went live during the 2007 writers' strike, ""and suffice it to say, he is a phenomenally good debater, if you had been keeping score, I would have lost roundly."" The creator of ""Family Guy,"" ""American Dad!"" and ""The Cleveland Show"" is a guest on tonight's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" ""I was really kind of in shock more than anything else,"" said MacFarlane. It was kind of an odd Hollywood moment. I was a huge fan of his show, and here I was getting this angry phone call."" MacFarlane told Morgan that he still maintains the standpoint that Stewart, ""arguably the most popular, successful television personality in the genre,"" ought to have stood up for ""the people who haven't made it yet."" He said that Stewart asked him who'd made him ""the moral arbiter of Hollywood."" When Morgan pointed out the irony in Stewart calling out MacFarlane for mocking him, MacFarlane joked. ""If I say yes, he's going to crucify me on his show every night for a year."" MacFarlane summed up the incident by telling Morgan that while he stands firm in his opinion that Stewart ought to have shut ""The Daily Show"" down during the strike, the ""Family Guy"" gag ""was probably so over the line in its ruthlessness that it probably could have been more measured in its execution."" When Morgan asked where his darkly hilarious, absurd, slightly sinister brand of humor comes from, MacFarlane said ""a lot of people in my family have very dark, very twisted senses of humor that I was exposed to at a very young age."" MacFarlane was very close to his mother, Ann Perry MacFarlane, whom he called ""invaluable"" to his comedy career, calling her sense of humor ""wickedly vicious."" MacFarlane, who lost his mother to cancer last year, told Morgan ""there was really nothing on 'Family Guy' or any of the other shows that could offend her,"" said MacFarlane. When Morgan pointed out that ""Family Guy"" has poked fun at paraplegics, multiple religions, pedophiles, AIDS, and did an opera version of the Nicole Simpson murder, among many other controversial topics, Macfarlane maintained that his mother remained ""unflappable,"" stating that ""there was really nothing that fazed her"" and that she herself had told her son stories about her past, ""none of which I can repeat on the air, that shocked the hell out of me."" MacFarlane called the fact that he was never able to shock his mother the reason was such a valuable resource. When it comes to what is and isn't off limits on his shows, MacFarlane told Morgan that he trusts his gut -- and the opinions of his team of writers, telling Morgan that they are ""very smart, very conscientious people who are aware of what is funny and what is going to be over the line."" Citing ""The Simpsons"" as one of his influences, MacFarlane called prime-time animation a great forum for satirical humor, calling it the televised translation of politic cartoons found in ""The New Yorker."" MacFarlane told Morgan ""if we're wrong about something, we have a table read, where we read the script aloud for the network, for the studio, for each other, for the animators. And we get a lot of groans if something's over the line at that point. And if we make it past that point, there's always broadcast standards who, in Fox's case, are actually very reasonable people who genuinely care about the comedy as much as they care about not getting the network fined."" MacFarlane told Morgan that comedy is often an edgy, cutting, dark medium and that ""Family Guy"" doesn't veer away from poking fun, even at 9/11. ""It always has to be funny,"" he said. ""If we're ever getting preachy or soapboxy then we're not really doing our jobs, and there have been times that we have gotten preachy and soapboxy, and that's us not really working as hard as we should."" MacFarlane himself had been booked on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston to Los Angeles -- the plane that hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. MacFarlane told Morgan that he'd given a lecture at his alma mater, Rhode Island School of Design, the night before and went out with some faculty members afterward and ""had a few pints."" Due to the combination of being hung over and having been mistakenly told by his travel agent that the flight was set to takeoff 10 minutes later than it did, MacFarlane arrived just after the gate closed. MacFarlane exchanged his ticket for a late-morning flight, dozed off in the lounge and woke up to the commotion surrounding the news that a plane had hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center. As the crowd gathered in the airport lounge watching the horror unfold, it was announced what flight it was. ""And I turned to the guy next to me, said MacFarlane. ""And said, 'My God! That was the flight I was supposed to be on. I was late. I missed it.' "" MacFarlane recalled a ""wonderful unity"" among the people in the airport that morning ""that we've since completely abandoned,"" recalling how the lounge bartender poured him a shot upon hearing that MacFarlane was supposed to have been on Flight 11. ""That feeling that must have been what, you know, our grandparents felt during World War II where, you know, this is -- in that moment, everything was -- we -- we're all the same,"" said MacFarlane. MacFarlane did tell Morgan, ""I'm not a fatalist,"" and admitted that the event, which was arguably a twist of fate for him, didn't shake him up the way it might others, because he habitually misses flights. ""A day before that incident, I could have been crossing the street five minutes earlier and gotten hit by a car and never known that I just missed it,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Born into grinding poverty and with a degenerative eye condition which left her almost totally blind, Terezinha Guilhermina first became aware of her athletic abilities when fleeing a school bully in her home city of Betim in Brazil. Despite her apparent disadvantage, Guilhermina easily outpaced her much older would-be assailant and, as fear mixed with exhilaration, she inadvertently found her true forte in life. ""I love to run. I feel free and complete,"" the three-time Paralympic gold medalist told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""The feeling of moving fast is just magical, it's wonderful."" Guilhermina may have been blessed with natural talent, but the handicaps she faced on her journey to track and field stardom would have defeated most mere mortals. Coming from a family of 12, her mother died when she was just nine and the children were often left to forage for leftovers just to feed themselves. ""We didn't have much to eat, our diet was always poor,"" the 34-year-old recalled. Despite her visual impairment, Guilhermina was forced to attend a regular school -- ""I suffered from bullying because I wasn't normal"" -- and was in her early 20s before she completed her education. Sporting dream . Still harboring a dream to excel at sports, the impoverished Guilhermina enrolled on a disability project being run by the Betim city council, focusing on swimming and running. ""I found an association that had sports for the vision-impaired. I joined and started to compete."" She initially chose swimming because she didn't own a pair of running shoes, but her sister, who worked as a maid, said ""here, take mine."" Guilhermina may have had a pair of hand-down trainers and a coach who encouraged her to compete in her first race, but her visual handicap left her at a further disadvantage. ""I had to train when no one was around because I had no guide,"" she said. So for fear of obstructing other runners, Guilhermina took to the track when it was deserted. ""I had to train at the hottest time, which was from 12-2 p.m. because there was no one around. I would run and run until I did 40 laps (16 kilometers)."" Existing on a diet of flour and sugar, living in a house where there was no real shelter from the rain, only an incredible inner will to succeed kept her going. ""I said I wanted to be the best in the world, I thought if I could make it, I would be able to change my future, to change my destiny,"" she said. ""I would push myself to the limits. I would do 70 laps and barely eat."" First prize . Guilhermina started taking part in local road races with the aim of making money to fund her activities and buy basic foodstuffs. ""The first money that I earned made me believe that I would be able to realize all my dreams,"" she said. ""I won 80 Reais ($40) in a street race, and stopped in a market to buy a yoghurt that I always dreamed of eating since I was little."" Her ability came to the notice of Brazilian Paralympic officials and she was selected to compete in the 2004 Games in Athens, over the distances of 400, 800 and 1500m. Categorized as T11 for athletes who have no functional vision, Guilhermina was able to run with a guide, but the athlete nominated to run with her proved of little use. ""When we got to Athens, the first thing he said was, 'You are on your own.' The night before the 400m race, he spent the whole night clubbing and during the event he almost fell ... he was more tired than I was!"" she said. Despite the near mishap, Guilhermina took the bronze medal in the 400m -- but finished down the field in the other two events. She realized that she was competing in the wrong races, and swapped the two longer ones for sprints over 100m and 200m. It proved an inspired move and, once she had mastered the skill of driving out of the starting blocks, Guilhermina never looked back. First gold . A world record in the 100m for her category came in 2007 and she won a full set of medals at the Beijing Paralympics the following year. Her defeat in 100m was a disappointment though, as Chinese runner Wu Chunmiao won gold. ""I was slow getting out of the blocks and I stumbled."" But Guilhermina made amends in the 200m to win her first Paralympic gold, and repeated her bronze of Athens in the 400m. Coming into London 2012, Guilhermina was ever more confident, particularly because of the ability of her guide runner, Guilherme Soares de Santana. He is her seventh, having come together in 2010. ""He's the best guide in the world because I'm not aware of him on the track. Guilherme has given me back the feeling of running by myself. That's the best gift I could have."" The ultimate goal for 2012 was a hat-trick of Paralympic golds and, after a comfortable win in the 200m, they seemed on track. Then disaster struck in the 400m, in one of the most heartbreaking moments of the Games. The pair looked set for victory when Soares de Santana fell in the finishing straight, pulling down Guilhermina in full flight. The capacity crowd gasped in disbelief as France's Assia El Hannouni crossed the line first while the Brazilian pair lay prone on the track. World record . In defeat, Guilhermina had made the headlines and highlighted the fine line between success and failure in disability sport. ""I felt literally blind in that moment, and that moment, he stopped being invisible to me,"" she recounted. But it was to be expected that Guilhermina would not let that setback derail her ambitions and the very next day, still ""very sore from all the previous races,"" she stormed to victory in the 100m in a world-record time of 12.01 seconds. Honor was restored after the bitter disappointment of just 24 hours previously, and she and Soares de Santana shared the glory on the podium. ""We are a team. If we lose we do it together, and if we win ... we win together,"" she said proudly. Despite her advancing years -- she will be pushing 38 by the time of the Rio Paralympics -- Guilhermina is absolutely determined to compete in her three events in front of home fans and achieve the hat-trick which so cruelly eluded her. ""I'm going to take care of myself so that in Rio I can win gold medals in every race I compete. I intend to do better than London when it comes to my times."" The inspiration is performing for the last time in front of her home fans and being a role model for the next generation. ""I feel honored to be an example for others,"" she said. ""It makes it feel worthwhile to have overcome all the challenges I have encountered so I can help others to dream and also fulfill their dreams."" Ultimate high . Guilhermina describes the award of the Summer and Paralympics Games to the Rio de Janeiro as a ""gift from god"" which leaves her with the opportunity to go out on the ultimate high with ""unforgettable moments"" which could not be topped. Her future after running is unclear, though when she was younger she had ambitions to go into the legal profession. Fearing that her disability would lead to being discriminated against in such a profession, Guilhermina opted for a sporting life. ""I feel like I've accomplished all my fantasies and childhood dreams,"" she said. ""I had nothing, now I have everything.""","Terezinha Guilhermina is the fastest blind woman runner in the world .

"(CNN) -- As the starting gates clatter open and the horses charge out under the reins of their riders, a nation will once again hold its breath. On Sunday, following an hors d'oeuvre of four-wheeled Formula One action at Suzuka, all eyes will turn to the main course in Paris as Japan's four-legged racers try to grab glory for the first time at the 93rd Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. So near, yet so far has been the story of recent times, with Japanese horses finishing second three times in the last four seasons -- Orfevre was the unlucky runner-up in 2012 and 2013, while Nakayama Festa missed out by a whisker in 2010. But a new year brings renewed hope for Japan's breeders, trainers and racing fanatics, with three horses -- Just A Way, Harp Star and Gold Ship -- lining up to tackle the mile-and-a-half showpiece at Longchamp. With an increased prize purse of â‚¬5 million ($6.5 million), the Arc is now the world's richest turf race. ""All Japanese racing fans are very excited about having three Japanese-trained horses in this year's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe -- this is the biggest number that we have sent to France,"" Japanese horse racing journalist and TV presenter Naohiro Goda told CNN. ""I think all three have a very good chance, but if I had to pick one of them I expect Harp Star is the best prospect among them -- she is the first three-year-old filly we have sent to the Arc."" It's an important point, as four of the last six Arc winners have been fillies -- the French-bred Treve being the latest 12 months ago. The other two hopefuls' prospects are harder to predict. Five-year-old Gold Ship can be brilliant on his day but is temperamental, while Goda thinks Just A Way may struggle with the distance, despite destroying the field in the Dubai Duty Free at the Meydan Racecourse last March. ""Just A Way is the world's highest-rated horse but a mile and a half is not his trip. We hope he can stay but it's not easy for horses that have never run 2,400 meters (1.5 miles) before,"" Goda says. From the Arc-hives . It's not so long ago that people might have laughed at the suggestion of a Japanese horse winning the Arc. The country's first entrant in 1969, Speed Symboli, finished 11th in a race won by the Irish-trained Levmoss. Further attempts in 1972 by Mejiro Mushahi and Sirius Symboli 14 years later ended with both horses way down the field. The breakthrough came in 1999 with U.S.-bred El Condor Pasa, which won the Japan Cup the previous year. He carried a sizable lead into the final two furlongs at Longchamp and looked a dead cert to upset favorite Montjeu, but the French thoroughbred refused to give up and sneaked ahead in the dying yards. That battle may have been lost but it signaled the start of Japanese horses gaining a foothold on the international stage. ""Before then, the standard of Japanese horses was not so high,"" Goda explains, while also noting two landmark victories in Grade One Stakes races the previous year. Taiki Shuttle's win in the Prix Jacques Le Marois followed compatriot Seeking the Pearl's triumph at the Prix Maurice de Gheest -- both run at France's Deauville racecourse. ""It was a breakthrough for Japanese racehorses racing overseas and now the standard of Japanese trained horses is very competitive all over the world,"" Goda says. Wins for Delta Blues at the Melbourne Cup in 2006 and Victoire Pisa at the 2011 Dubai World Cup bear testament to this fact -- but also to the dedication of the Yoshida family, which oversees a vast breeding operation on Hokkaido. Now run by three brothers -- Teruya, Katsumi and Heruya -- its assets include the world-famous Shadai Stallion Station, home to leading sire Deep Impact. ""Without the great support of the Yoshida brothers in the breeding industry, I think it is impossible to contemplate a Japanese horse winning the Arc,"" Goda says. Big in Japan . The near misses of recent years have only added to the intrigue, with interest back in Japan reaching fever pitch in recent days. ""There has been huge coverage all week so far,"" says Goda. ""All the newspapers and sports papers are covering it. Many of the major TV and radio stations have been dispatching their correspondents to Chantilly to see how Japanese horses are training. ""On Sunday evening, two television stations are going to have live coverage even though the start time is after midnight and millions of Japanese people are going to watch the race live on TV,"" he adds. Goda has seen plenty of Arcs come and go over the years. His first trip to Longchamp was in 1986 -- seen by many as a vintage year for the event, with one of the best fields ever assembled. His latest sojourn in the French capital could prove equally memorable. It would certainly be a fitting year for Japan to break its duck, he thinks. ""We have three Japanese-trained horses on Sunday, all ridden by Japanese jockeys. Last year, Orfevre was ridden by French jockey Christophe Soumillon,"" he says. ""The fact we are sending pure Japanese teams (this year) is quite important for Japanese society. We hope to see one of these teams raise the national flag on the center pole on Sunday.""

"Washington (CNN) -- A white diplomatic van shown plowing into anti-government protesters in Cairo might belong to the United States, officials said, adding that 20 such vehicles have been stolen in Egypt amid the unrest. The YouTube video, dated January 28, is one of three from recent days showing drivers seemingly purposefully ramming their vehicle into demonstrators in streets that appear to be around Cairo's Tahrir Square. The footage caused an uproar online, some of it related to the fact that the van appeared to resemble a U.S. diplomatic vehicle. ""Obviously, we've seen some of the reaction on YouTube and other forums, which is why we're trying to get out and knock this erroneous story down,"" U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Friday afternoon. Fellow State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley was the first to comment earlier Friday, saying that American officials were ""very aware"" of the video and trying to get more information on what happened. Later, the State Department and U.S. Embassy in Egypt issued a joint statement also acknowledging video of the ""hit-and-run"" incident that ""injured dozens in Cairo."" A spokesman did not explain how U.S. officials came to that casualty toll. The statement noted that ""a number of U.S. Embassy vehicles"" were stolen on January 28, when Egyptian police abandoned their posts in droves around Cairo. Toner later clarified that 20 vehicles had been taken.

"(CNN) -- The July/August cover story of the Atlantic, ""Why Women Still Can't Have It All"" by Anne-Marie Slaughter, has ignited a firestorm. One side accepts the author's argument: that feminism has set women up to fail by pretending they can have a high-powered career and still be an involved mother. The other side accuses Slaughter, who left her job as the first female director of policy planning at the State Department, of setting women back by telling them to ""rediscover the pursuit of happiness,"" starting at home. Slaughter's article contains a powerful critique of the insanely rigid workplace culture that produces higher levels of career-family conflict among Americans -- among men and women -- than among any of our Western European counterparts, without measurably increasing our productivity or gross national product. And she makes sensible suggestions about how to reorganize workplaces and individual career paths to lessen that conflict. Unfortunately, the way the discussion is framed perpetuates two myths: that feminism is to blame for raising unrealistic expectations about ""having it all"" and that work-family dilemmas are primarily an issue for women. Let's start by recognizing that the women's movement never told anybody that they could ""have it all."" That concept was the brainchild of advertising executives, not feminist activists. Feminism insists on women's right to make choices -- about whether to marry, whether to have children, whether to combine work and family or to focus on one over the other. It also urges men and women to share the joys and burdens of family life and calls on society to place a higher priority on supporting caregiving work. Second, we should distinguish between high-powered careers that really are incompatible with active involvement in family life and those that force people to choose between work and family only because of misguided employment requirements and inadequate work-family policies. By her account, Slaughter had one of the former. Before she ""dropped out"" merely to become a full-time professor, write books and make 40 to 50 speeches each year, Slaughter left Trenton, New Jersey, every Monday on the 5:30 a.m. train to Washington and didn't get back until late Friday night. Such a job is incompatible with family obligations and pleasures for men as well as for women. The real question is not why so many women feel compelled to walk away from these jobs but why so few men feel the same way. The teaser at the top of the Atlantic article claims that ""women who have managed to be both mothers and top professionals are superhuman, rich or self-employed."" But that sentence is missing an adjective. What it really means is that women who manage simultaneously to be involved mothers and top professionals in the United States are a rare and privileged group. Men who manage to be involved fathers and top professionals are equally rare and privileged. The irony is that most jobs, even top professional positions, do not actually require as much absenteeism from family as employers often impose. University of Texas sociologist Jennifer Glass, a senior fellow at the Council on Contemporary Families, points out that corporate and government professionals in the United States put in much longer workweeks than their counterparts in Europe, where limits on work hours are common, workplace flexibility is more widespread, and workers are entitled to far more vacation days per year than most Americans -- and actually use them. U.S. companies generally penalize workers who try to cut back on hours, reducing their hourly wages even when their hourly productivity remains the same or increases. The European Union, by contrast, forbids employers to pay less per hour for the same work when it is done part time than when it is done full time. ""In a system where work hours are encouraged to spiral out of control at the highest positions,"" Glass notes, ""the people who make it to the top -- male or female -- have little time for family or community commitments, and little patience for the family commitments of the people they supervise."" Slaughter ultimately suggests some excellent reforms that would allow both men and women to meet their work and family commitments more successfully, although she inexplicably describes them as ""solutions to the problems of professional women."" Later she acknowledges that work-family issues plague all American workers, regardless of their sex, income level, occupational niche or even parental status since many childless workers have responsibilities to aging parents or ill partners. In fact, according to the New York-based Families and Work Institute, men now report even higher levels of work-family conflict than women do. It was a great victory for gender equality when people finally stopped routinely saying ""she's awfully good at her job -- for a woman."" The next big step forward will be when people stop saying, ""It's awfully tough to balance work and family -- for a woman."" It's tough for men and women. We need to push for work-family practices and policies that allow individuals to customize their work lives according to their changing individual preferences and family obligations, not just their traditional gender roles.

"North Miami Beach, Florida (CNN) -- Criminals across the country are raking in billions of dollars in tax refunds through a new and brazen form of fraud that takes advantage of the IRS's fast online returns, law enforcement officials say. Using laptops and free Wi-Fi connections, criminals are stealing identities and using the names of legitimate taxpayers to file fraudulent online tax returns. They've raked in billions, buying luxury cars, expensive jewelry and plastic surgery, police said. ""It's like the federal government is putting crack cocaine in candy machines,"" said Detective Craig Catlin of the North Miami Beach, Florida, Police Department. ""It's that easy."" First, thieves obtain Social Security numbers and other personal information from insiders at hospitals, doctor's offices, car dealerships or anywhere the information is stored. Then, they file an online tax return using the real taxpayer's name and a fictitious income. In most cases, the criminals buy a debit card so the IRS can issue the refund on that card, although some thieves have also gotten their returns on actual Treasury checks. The thieves know that the IRS does not verify the employer W-2s sent with the return until after the refund is issued. It is a particular problem in the state of Florida, according to law enforcement officials. ""We can't go ... two days in a row without making a traffic stop, and there's going to be tax return fraud in the car,"" Catlin said. ""We could stop an 18-year-old kid who's got five (debit) cards. The average is $5,000 per card. So they'll have $25,000, which is really cash, even though it's on debit cards."" And it's not just small-time criminals, he said. ""We have other cases that range up to $100 million where subjects have opened up corporations and bank accounts and business accounts,"" Catlin said. ""And they're receiving millions of dollars from the IRS that are all fraudulent."" Prisoners' tax refund scam nets millions from IRS . Last year, North Miami Beach police arrested the leader of the ""Money Avenue"" gang that they say specializes in tax return fraud. When police searched his home, they found about $250,000 in debit cards ""just sitting on the dining room table for that week's worth of work,"" Catlin said. ""And inside his closet, there were nine to 10 spiral notebooks, ledgers of names, Social Security numbers, and dates of birth and the dollar amounts of returns that they've done on 3,000 victims,"" he added. It's a crime that has replaced drug dealing in many neighborhoods. ""They're sitting on a computer or iPad; they're doing a return with a stolen identity where they don't have to rob anybody or stick a gun in anybody's face or run through the streets from police,"" Catlin said. Although tax refund fraud has been around for decades, North Miami's interim police Chief Larry Gomer said the speedy returns and the option of having your refund issued on a debit card are making it easier for criminals to pull off the fraud. ""I think (the IRS's) intentions might have been good in trying to speed returns to members of the community, but I think the problem is, they have set up a system that is too easy to abuse,"" Gomer said. He suggested that the IRS slow its processing of tax returns. ""Right now, when someone becomes a victim of income tax fraud and they catch it, it could take up to a year for them to get their return,"" Gomer said. ""But the way that the IRS is running the system right now, somebody can make a fraudulent return, (and) they are mailing out a check to them in two weeks without checking the information on the return."" In Florida, where identity theft is rampant, the cities of North Miami Beach and Tampa have been particularly hard hit by the fraud. Police estimate that in the past two years, criminals in Tampa have cashed in on $450 million in fraudulent tax return money. Even police who are fully aware of the scam have become targets themselves, including four North Miami Beach Police Department detectives who specialize in combating tax refund fraud and officers in other South Florida police departments. Police in Tampa discovered ""a written tutorial that tells you step by step how to commit this type of crime,"" according to the city's police chief, Jane Castor. ""Throughout those written pages, it says how simple it is to do it,"" she said. ""We've also heard from people on the street that it's about a five-minute street-corner lesson."" In fact, a police informant who teaches friends how to commit the fraud said anyone could learn it. ""It's like friends get together, and everybody brings their laptops, and we all work together,"" the informant said. ""Some people I know get up at like 8 in the morning and don't finish until 8 at night."" Law enforcement officials said that if the IRS stopped allowing the use of debit cards, that would curtail a majority of the fraud. ""The debit cards are a huge problem,"" Castor said. ""Plus ... the (IRS's) focus, from my understanding, is getting these tax returns out quickly ... so instead of focusing on getting those out quickly, (the IRS should) put more of a focus on the fraudulent aspect of it."" Deputy IRS Commissioner Beth Tucker pointed out that the debit cards are widely used by legitimate taxpayers who may not have a bank account. ""One hundred and forty million folks are filing their returns every year. Not every taxpayer has a bank account, and so the debit cards that are issued by a third-party provider are a legitimate way for taxpayers to get their refund,"" she said. Last year, the IRS reported 938,664 fraudulent returns related to identity theft, totaling $6.5 billion, Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George told a House subcommittee this month. Treasury officials say that was money identified by the IRS as fraudulent but not actually issued. The IRS could not provide an estimate of how much fraudulent refund money it has issued. ""Any dollar that goes out of our tax system related to refund fraud is a dollar too much,"" Tucker said. ""We have noticed that there are more folks attempting identity theft. We're in the middle of filing season, and we should be able to have a better assessment of exactly what the dollar amount could potentially be."" Last year, the IRS identified at least 582,000 taxpayers who were the victims of identity theft, which is more than double the amount from only three years prior. In testimony before Congress last year, National Taxpayer Advocate Nina Olson said the IRS has implemented a number of filters to catch the fraud, including an electronic marker to mark accounts of verified identity theft victims, an IRS identity theft affidavit form and a standardized list of acceptable documents to substantiate identity theft. Tucker said the IRS filters are ""in place from the start of the filing season"" and are ""part of our prevention and detection."" She also said the IRS has trained 40,000 employees across the country in the past three months to deal with identity theft. Also, the IRS last year began issuing an Identity Protection Personal Identification Number to victims of identity theft when filing their future returns. But the filters, according to Olson's annual report to Congress, ""inevitably block large numbers of proper refund claims"" since there ""is no easy way to distinguish proper claims from improper ones."" Tax refund fraud by identity theft will be the subject of Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Subcommittee on Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Growth. It is the third hearing on the issue since last year. Tampa officials have expressed concern that the IRS is not doing enough to combat the situation, which Castor said is one of the worst cases of fraud she has seen in her career. ""In my 28 years of law enforcement, I don't think that I have ever seen this magnitude of fraud that is just wide open,"" the police chief said. ""It's wide open and there just doesn't seem to be much being done about it."" Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn said he's angry that the IRS has not done more to help the city combat the fraud. ""As far as I'm concerned, they're missing in action,"" Buckhorn said. ""They have not been helpful; they have not been a player; they have not taken responsibility for their side of the enforcement. If anything, you know, we've been banging our heads against their door asking for help and getting nothing in response. The silence has been deafening."" Tucker disagreed with the mayor, noting that the IRS has ""significantly increased the amount of resources we've devoted to identity theft, a heinous crime."" A week after CNN's March 6 interview with Tucker, the IRS sent a team of officials to meet with police officials in North Miami Beach and Tampa. Buckhorn said the problem in Tampa is ""just the tip of the iceberg"" and offered this warning to the mayors of other U.S. cities: . ""Go back and ask the IRS in (your) jurisdiction, 'What are you doing? Is this a problem in my jurisdiction?' Because I guarantee you it is,"" Buckhorn said. ""You may not know it, but it is.""

"Gloucester, Massachusetts (CNN) -- By daybreak, much of this town has already been at work for hours. Fishermen have long since cast off aboard boats named for their sweethearts and chugged out to sea before sunrise. Clad in yellow and orange rubber suits, these seafarers drag giant nets across the ocean floor during 12-hour work days, hauling back the fish they will later bring to market. For some 400 years, fishing has sustained communities such as Gloucester along America's northeastern shores, where thousands of seafood processors, wholesalers, distributors and retailers make a living off the waterfront. ""It's kind of the bread-and-butter and the backbone of the community,"" said Dennis Robillard, who has scooped up fish off the coast of Massachusetts for more than two decades. Now the federal government is contemplating what for generations seemed inconceivable -- restricting or shutting down most of the cod fishing in the Gulf of Maine, a region that extends from Cape Cod up through Nova Scotia. A recent government survey found that Gulf of Maine cod, considered a top earner for fishermen in the region, are in far lower numbers than what experts had thought. Just three years earlier, the government had projected the area was well on its way to recovery after decades of overfishing. Since then, federal regulators have raised cod catch rates to nearly five times the sustainable level based on what are now reported as overly optimistic and incomplete estimates. The new data now suggests the stocks are so depleted that even if the fishing industry were to shut down, codfish would still not recover by 2014 to the levels mandated by federal law. Beginning in May, that will trigger a legal requirement that fishermen bring in around 22% less cod than they caught last year. But next year is the big one -- Gulf of Maine cod fishing could face more than an 80% reduction from prior years' catches. ""This is total Armageddon now for the fishery,"" said Vito Giacalone, a third-generation Gloucester fisherman and policy director for the Northeast Seafood Coalition, an advocacy group for the fishing industry. The coming restrictions, he and others say, are based on assumptions that come from data that's ""inherently volatile."" ""What happens when you do everything right and they still shut you down?"" Cod also swim alongside other fish, which means the proposed reductions would impact other industry staples such as flounder and haddock, even though those populations are considered to be far healthier. While larger trawlers capable of traveling to more distant fishing grounds are expected to survive, the reductions could cost most of the region's smaller crews their jobs. ""We basically have a balloon payment now to make up for those years (of overfishing),"" said Steven Cadrin, a scientist at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth, who worked on the assessment. Cadrin and others say a year isn't enough time to make up the difference and meet federal mandates, which he says could signal an end to much of the region's small-boat fleet. Environmentalists say depleted stocks show the region needs time to recover. ""The coastal fishermen are facing an impossible situation through no fault of their own,"" said Peter Shelley, a lawyer with the Boston-based Conservation Law Foundation, an environmental advocacy group. ""But once those fisheries are gone, that's it."" Still, codfish aren't about to become an endangered species, according to Sam Rauch, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's fisheries service. The coming restrictions are about protecting the overall size of the cod population, which has been at steady but low levels for decades, and complying with federal law. Confronted with possible drops in domestic supply, industry analysts say U.S. cod consumers will likely look elsewhere, importing more from countries such as Canada and Norway. ""It will affect the local fresh market,"" said Cadrin. ""But there's a lot of frozen cod on the market from elsewhere."" Aboard the Julie Ann II, a not-quite-paid-off fishing trawler named for Robillard's wife, talk of cutbacks is a source of anxiety. ""If they cut half the quota, that's my last day here,"" said crew member Kevon Hughes, hauling back nets from the day's catch -- a mixture of cod, lobsters and flounder. ""I'd have to leave."" Hughes, his face pink from the biting cold of a winter wind at sea, says he's tired of the uncertainty. ""I'm sick of everybody else running my life, my income,"" he said. ""It's up to them. It has nothing to do with me."" Fishermen say the cod report doesn't actually reflect what they've seen out on the water. Surveys come from a murky science, they say, that rely on catch records, government observers and random samplings at sea. ""Fish have tails. They move,"" said Giacalone, emphasizing the difficulty of counting unseen fish in a region the size of Indiana that nearly spans the length of New England. ""The data they have is 'best available,'"" he said. ""We're going to destroy 400 years of fishing based on what's 'best available'?"" Cadrin, a former NOAA scientist, said the survey is ""not much different than a weather report"" and considers the issue more of an ""administrative crisis than an environmental one."" But the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says the work is based on three years of additional data, and includes better technologies as well as records of fish discarded by recreational agencies -- something that wasn't tallied in 2008. ""We just have a much more realistic picture of the stock,"" said NOAA spokeswoman Teri Frady. ""The really troubling thing here is the low number of young fish coming in."" Other factors, she noted, like shifts in water temperature and natural predators, also likely contributed to the depletion of a once cod-heavy region. ""Cod fishing in New England is like cowboys out West,"" said Frady, stressing New England's historical ties to the bottom-dwelling ground fish. ""They don't call it Cape Cod for nothing."" Her agency's report has become a hot topic among interests groups and legislators in New Hampshire and Maine, though especially in Boston, where a wooden carving of a codfish still hangs from the House of Representatives. Massachusetts ranks second, behind California, in the number of jobs supported by the fishing industry. And Gulf of Maine cod brought in nearly $16 million to the regional economy in 2010, before distribution sales were tallied. ""When I was a kid growing up, people would ask who your father went fishing with as a way of identifying who you are,"" said Mike Parisi, 62, owner of Amanda Marie Fishing Charters in Gloucester. ""It's been a way of life here."" Recreational fishing on charter boats, like the one Parisi owns, now account for more than 30% of the region's total catch. The danger, industry advocates say, is a loss of market share. ""You can't expect the fishery to come back in the same way after taking years off,"" said Jackie Odell, executive director of the Northeast Seafood Coalition. ""Your suppliers and consumers just go elsewhere. It takes years to develop those kinds of relationships,"" and marine property owners will eventually want to use their land for something else. The issue garnered national attention last year when Senate lawmakers petitioned NOAA to reevaluate its findings. ""The most recent Gulf of Maine cod assessment threatens to further exacerbate a number of issues our fishermen already face, with potentially disastrous consequences,"" Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, wrote in a letter, asking for a new assessment. NOAA declined the request, citing time constraints that prevented it from conducting another report ahead of the 2012 fishing season. ""The only real solution is more fish,"" said Frady of NOAA. ""Unless we just decide to make fishing less efficient."" Agency officials also point out that their assessment had been reviewed by other independent scientists and would likely yield similar results.","Small-boat fishermen face steep cuts in cod fishing .

"(CNN) -- A wide-eyed, open-mouthed model of a dinosaur hatchling, the theft of which apparently was captured by surveillance cameras, is safely back in its nest at a North Carolina museum exhibit. Police said the statue was inside a bag left Wednesday night near a rear service entrance at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh. Museum officials estimated the value of the 12- to 14-inch-long model at $10,000. Logan Todd Ritchey, 21, and Alyssa Ann Lavacca, 21, turned themselves in Thursday morning, according to the North Carolina State Capitol Police. They have been charged with two felony counts of theft or destruction of property of museums. In surveillance images taken Monday, a male in striped shorts is seen climbing over a low glass barrier into a museum exhibit and bending down. He then hops back out over the barrier and puts something in a large, multicolored purse carried by a female accomplice. Security guards discovered the replica was missing the next day. Police also suspect the pair in a similarly odd theft of items at the North Carolina Museum of History. Inventory missing from that museum included a prop cabbage head, a prop corn cob and prop doilies, along with a real medicine bottle, said Jackson Marshall, associate director of the history museum. They were later found at the sciences museum, Marshall said. Police said the suspects have been cooperative in the investigation. ""I doubt these two individuals realized the seriousness of tampering with artifacts and exhibits in a public museum,"" said State Capitol Police Chief Glen Allen.","Baby dinosaur replica at N.C.

"(CNN) -- Thousands of travelers are facing long delays and cancellations as a strike by French air traffic controllers intensifies, wreaking havoc with flight schedules across Europe. On Wednesday, the second day of the industrial action over aviation cuts, the situation was ""unstable,"" according to European air safety body Eurocontrol. Leading European carriers including British Airways, EasyJet and Ryanair have all reported flight cancellations and delays. Eurocontrol earlier said the strike was expected to cause up to 14,000 hours of delays. Ryanair said in a statement it expected to cancel 15% of its 1,600 scheduled flights on Wednesday and warned the situation was likely to deteriorate further. ""We expect that these delays will continue to build through the morning as the backlog of delayed flights rises,""it said. ""Ryanair apologizes sincerely for any delays or inconvenience caused to our customers by this unnecessary and regrettable French ATC strike."" The budget airline earlier accused air traffic controllers of ""blackmailing"" passengers and urged European Union officials to ban them from taking industrial action. Also Wednesday, Brussels Airport said all flights were cancelled from 6 p.m. local time after some Belgian air traffic controllers voted to stage a walkout. Many passengers took to Twitter to vent their frustration over the disruption. ""Can't sleep Too busy worrying about the controllers strike.

"(CNN) -- Your email is subject to U.S. government snooping even if it is stored in computer servers outside the United States, a federal judge ruled Thursday in a potentially landmark case governing privacy and the limits of government surveillance powers. Ruling from the bench in New York, U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska ruled that Microsoft Corp. has to comply with a U.S. law enforcement search warrant demanding a customer's emails stored on computer servers in Ireland. Microsoft, in an unusual move, had challenged the government's search warrant, saying it violated constitutional privacy protections and that U.S. warrants only were valid in the United States. The company immediately said it would appeal the ruling. The dispute is part of a larger debate over government surveillance spurred on by the disclosures of former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who leaked classified documents detailing the NSA's programs with broad reach into the private information and communications of people around the world, including those of Americans. Tech firms complain . U.S. technology companies long have quietly complied with government surveillance requests, in part because the U.S. law largely prohibits companies from revealing surveillance orders. But following the Snowden disclosures, tech giants including Yahoo, Microsoft and Google have sought to distance themselves from the government's surveillance apparatus. The issue has implications for the U.S. economy and the tech business. Companies have said that they could face the loss of business from customers around the world because of the fear that they can't protect customer privacy as well as non-U.S. competitors. Earlier this year, Brazilian legislators sought to require all telecom and email providers store Brazilian customer data in Brazil, in a bid to protect consumer privacy. The provision didn't make into the Brazilian on-line privacy bill signed into law. Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, argued in a Wall Street Journal opinion article this week, ""In our view, that the U.S. government can obtain emails only subject to the full legal protections of the Constitution's Fourth Amendment. It means, in this case, that the U.S. government must have a warrant. But under well-established case law, a search warrant cannot reach beyond U.S. shores."" Test case on privacy . The government sought the emails in a narcotics investigation, Microsoft said. Under U.S. law, the emails stored in a so-called cloud server are business records subject to federal law enforcement warrants no matter where they are stored. Microsoft, with the backing of Internet consumer privacy groups and other tech companies, including Apple, sought to use the case as a warning to U.S. consumers that their emails could become the subject of snooping by foreign governments. ""It's hard to believe that the American people will blithely accept that foreign governments can obtain their emails stored in U.S. data centers without letting them know or notifying the U.S. government,"" Smith said in his opinion article. ""Yet the U.S. government is taking precisely this position toward emails stored in Microsoft's data center in Ireland."" Chinese raid . In court on Thursday, a Microsoft attorney noted that just this week Chinese authorities raided a Microsoft office and sought access to company data stored outside China, including in the United States. Government lawyers said the issue was a diplomatic one, and wasn't relevant to the case at hand.","Federal ruling is a potential landmark on privacy and government surveillance .
Microsoft must now comply with a search warrant demanding emails stored in Ireland .
The tech giant challenged the warrant, saying it violated privacy protections. It will appeal .
The case grew out of issues from NSA surveillance secrets disclosed by Edward Snowden ."
"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The 20-year-old son of actor Robert Downey Jr. has been charged with felony drug possession, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office said. Indio Falconer Downey, 20, will be arraigned on August 29 on one felony count of possession of a controlled substance, cocaine, and a misdemeanor count of possession of drug paraphernalia, a coke pipe, said spokesman Ricardo Santiago. Downey was arrested after a Los Angeles sheriff's deputy stopped a vehicle in which he was a passenger in West Hollywood in June, according to West Hollywood Sheriff's Station Sgt. Dave Valentine. ""Downey was found to be in possession of what officers believed to be cocaine as well as a smoking pipe,"" Valentine said. Robert Downey Jr.'s representative released a statement that week saying the actor was ""grateful to the Sheriff's department for their intervention.""

"(CNN) -- An experimental Ebola drug that's still in development may now be used to treat more people with the disease, according to Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corporation. The drug company said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized expanded use of TKM-Ebola under its Investigational New Drug application rule. Expanded access allows patients outside of a clinical trial to be treated with an investigational drug if they have a life-threatening disease and have exhausted any other approved treatment options. The FDA allows this kind of access on a case-by-case basis. ""We have worked with the FDA and Health Canada to establish this framework and a treatment protocol allowing us to do what we can to help these patients,"" Dr. Mark J. Murray, Tekmira's president and CEO, said in a statement. In January, a small human trial of TKM-Ebola was put on hold after one volunteer developed moderate gastrointestinal side effects after receiving a high dose of the medication. Then last month, the FDA modified the hold to a ""partial clinical hold."" This meant that Tekmira could give the drug to doctors or hospitals that requested it on an emergency basis. According to Murray, the treatment has already been given to a number of patients and ""repeat infusions"" of the drug have been well tolerated. Though more Ebola patients may now be given the drug, he warns that they will not be enrolled in a controlled clinical trial. FDA spokesperson Stephanie Yao said federal law and FDA regulations prevent the agency from disclosing information about products under development because it's considered confidential. ""While the FDA cannot comment on the development of specific medical products,"" Yao said, ""it's important to note that every FDA regulatory decision is based on a risk-benefit assessment of scientific data that includes the context of use for the product and the patient population being studied."" According to the company, the FDA granted Tekmira fast track status to develop TKM-Ebola back in March. Murray said their supply is limited, ""but we will continue to help where we can.""

"(CNN) -- A young man featured in the CNN series ""Chicagoland"" was shot this weekend on the streets of southside Chicago. Police have not released the victim's name, but friends close to him confirm it was Lee McCollum Jr. McCollum was shot twice in the leg on Saturday morning and was treated and released from a local hospital, according to his mentor and high school principal, Liz Dozier, who was also featured on the ""Chicagoland"" series. As told in ""Chicagoland,"" McCollum's story is one of a young man who grew up in a tough part of the city but was transforming his life. He went from being a gang member to high school prom king and student leader. McCollum has aspirations to leave Chicago and attend college, Dozier said. ""The goal is still to get him to go. There's nothing for him here in Chicago."" According to the police report, the shooting happened about 7 a.m. Saturday. The 20-year-old man was standing outside when shots were fired from a white vehicle that passed by. Police are investigating and no one is in custody. Dozier said though McCollum is not in a gang now, that doesn't mean he was a random victim. The police report states the shooting may have been gang-related. The executive producers and directors of the series said this is part of the reality that many young people in Chicago live every day.

"Gaza City (CNN) -- United Nations workers trying to aid people in Gaza found themselves stuck Tuesday between Israeli soldiers and Hamas fighters, with neither side showing any sign of backing down. The development came as a rocket fired from Gaza struck near Israel's biggest airport, prompting many airlines around the world to suspend flights -- just days after the downing of a commercial jetliner over eastern Ukraine. The U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees found rockets hidden in one of its vacant Gaza schools, the second such discovery at a vacant school since the fighting began. At the same time, a spokesman for UNRWA told CNN that for the second day, tank shells ""believed to be from the Israeli military"" hit an unoccupied girls' school that had housed 300 of the estimated 118,000 civilians being sheltered by the agency. ""During the two hour window the U.N. staff went to the school to investigate the damage and see what happened, further shelling took place which endangered the lives of the U.N. staff and put them in serious danger,"" Chris Gunness, the spokesman for UNRWA, told CNN. ""...The IDF had the GPS coordinates of the girls school, which was clearly marked by a U.N. flag."" The IDF has previously accused militants of hiding weapons in U.N. shelters, though there is no specific such claim in this incident. Death toll rises . Fifteen days after Israel began hitting Gaza targets with airstrikes, and later a punishing ground offensive meant to locate and destroy tunnels used by fighters, the casualties mounted. Palestinian health officials said at least 649 Palestinians had been killed and 4,120 wounded, Gaza's health ministry said. Some 70% to 80% of them civilians, according to the United Nations. Twenty-nine Israeli soldiers and two Israeli civilians have been confirmed killed in the conflict. Two Israeli soldiers were killed Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces said. Uncertainty remained over the fate of another Israeli soldier, claimed as a captive by Hamas after the armored personnel carrier he was traveling in was ambushed on Sunday. Six other IDF soldiers died in the ambush. On Tuesday, the Israeli military released the soldier's name -- Sgt. Oren Shaul -- saying, ""We are still working to identify his body."" Israeli media reported that the soldier was missing and presumed dead. Israel finds Hamas are no longer amateur fighters . Peace talks . Bearing orders from U.S. President Barack Obama to push for an ""immediate cessation of hostilities,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met Tuesday with Egyptian and Arab League officials in Cairo, Egypt. ""We've had constructive meetings thus far, and I intend to be continuing our conversations through today and into the next days in order to work to see if we can find a way forward, a way that ends the violence and then addresses the underlying causes of this crisis,"" Kerry said. That approach mirrors one taken by Egyptian and Arab League officials, who have urged Hamas to accept a cease-fire, then enter dialogue to discuss its broader concerns. Hamas rejected the first cease-fire proposed by Egyptian officials, saying negotiators hadn't consulted the group's leaders. They want a broad deal including the release of recently detained Palestinians and the easing of border restrictions. ""We want to reach a cease-fire agreement that will end all hostilities and end the siege of Gaza,"" Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said Tuesday in a televised address. In Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu showed U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon a collection of rockets that had been fired into Israel. Ban called the evidence ""quite shocking"" and called for an immediate end to the attacks. But he also chided Israel over its military campaign, saying it ""will not increase Israel's stability and security in the longer term."" ""My message to Israelis and Palestinians is the same: Stop fighting, start talking and take on the root causes of the conflict so we are not back in the same situation in six months or a year,"" he said. Netanyahu, however, argued there's little Israel can do to satisfy Hamas. ""What grievance can we solve for Hamas?"" he said. ""Their grievance is that we exist."" On the ground in Gaza . Dozens of Palestinians died Tuesday in the fighting, Palestinian health officials said. The death toll rose from 604 early in the day to 630 by evening. One child was injured when the ""explosive ordinance"" hit the girls' school turned shelter on Monday afternoon, UNRWA spokesman Sami Mashasha told CNN. When U.N. officials went to inspect the damage on Tuesday, the building was struck again, Mashasha said. The Israeli military said it hit more than 187 targets overnight, most of them in Shaja'ia, a neighborhood east of Gaza City near the border with Israel. The IDF says Hamas uses the residential area as a ""fortress for its weapons, rockets, tunnels and command centers."" In one skirmish, the IDF said, paratroopers encountered a squad of militant fighters who were later hit with an airstrike. Several militants escaped in a civilian ambulance, the IDF said. Troops also uncovered 66 openings to 23 tunnels, six of which were destroyed, the IDF said. The flood of people seeking refuge from the violence is straining UNRWA's resources and threatening a humanitarian disaster, the agency said. Uncollected waste and unexploded ordinance were growing problems, the agency said. Palestinian lawmaker Mustafa Barghouti accused the Israeli government of carrying out a massacre. ""This has to stop,"" he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday. The United States had pledged $47 million in humanitarian aid for Gaza, Kerry said Tuesday. On the ground in Israel . Shortly after noon in Washington, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to stop flying to Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv for up to 24 hours, after a rocket struck a home nearby. At least one flight, Delta Flight 468, diverted to Paris prior to the FAA order. The airline said it was temporarily suspending service ""to ensure the safety and security of our customers and employees."" A number of other airlines, including Korean Air, Air Canada, and KLM also suspended service. The strike was one of 41 the Israeli military said had been launched out of Gaza since midnight and more than 2,000 since the military operation began. Israel's Iron Dome defense system intercepted 11 of the rockets, including one over Tel Aviv and seven over the city of Ashdod, the Israeli military said. Others fell to the ground harmlessly outside of the city of Be'er Sheva, according to police. Elsewhere in the world . -- The U.N. Security Council held a debate on the situation in the Middle East on Tuesday. ""With no regard for human life, Israel, the occupying power, continues to slaughter entire families,"" said Riyad Mansour, the head of the Palestinian permanent observer mission to the United Nations. He went on to read the names of 44 children, ranging in age from 8 months to 15 years, killed in the fighting. David Roet, Israel's deputy permanent representative to the U.N., told the council that international aid dollars had gone to Hamas to build tunnels designed to infiltrate Israel and inflict casualties on its civilian population. ""Imagine what it is like to fall asleep wondering if a terrorist is tunneling under your home or to wake up and wonder if your children will be safe on their way to school,"" he said. ""Just yesterday, heavily armed Hamas terrorists emerged from a tunnel 200 meters from a kindergarten."" -- In Lebanon, the militant group Hezbollah reached out in support of Hamas, raising questions about whether Israel might have to fight on two fronts. -- A day after a pro-Palestinian protest in Chicago, demonstrators there rallied in support of Israel outside the Israeli Consulate. Ian Lee reported from Gaza City. Chelsea J. Carter and Michael Pearson reported and wrote from Atlanta and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Karl Penhaul, Ali Younes, Kareem Khadder, Ben Wedeman, Atika Shubert, Yon Pomrenze, Tim Lister, Richard Roth and Salma Abdelaziz contributed to this report.","NEW: Palestinian death toll rises to 649, Israeli troop deaths up to 29 .

"(CNN) -- Manned space missions bring with them a plethora of challenges to keep astronauts alive and healthy, especially on long-duration space missions. Astronauts need to breathe, eat, drink, excrete their food and drink, and be kept free of infections to stay healthy enough to do their job. The key to an astronauts' wellbeing has been found, somewhat contradictorily, to be a group of tiny organisms -- bacteria. You might think of space as a germ-free environment, but microbes can be carried to space inside human gut flora as well as in food and water and once up there, can be expelled by humans in their breath. According to NASA, immune systems weaken during space flight, making the impact of infection even greater. What's more, the weightless microgravity environment of space can alter bacteria as they grow. Recent work by Cheryl Nickerson and her team from Arizona State University and her NASA collaborators discovered that certain bacteria become more virulent in space, meaning they become better at causing disease. ""Salmonella bacteria become more potent, virulent and are more able to cause disease,"" says Nickerson. ""They also become more resistant to factors such as the acid in your stomach."" Nickerson's group is investigating a range of bacteria found in food, water and our gut flora, including Salmonella typhimurium, a common cause of food poisoning and diarrhea, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a known water contaminant. 'War with microorganisms' As astronauts spend longer periods of time in space, their increased exposure to recycled air and water is likely to affect their risk of infection. Mark Ott is one the people in charge of crew health at NASA and focuses on keeping microbes at bay. ""We're at a constant war with microorganisms because they adapt,"" he says. ""The stressful environment of spaceflight affects them and under stress your immune system also functions less effectively and we have to take precautions for this."" Reduced immunity can cause some bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, to cause illness despite normally being carried by many of us with no effect. ""However, not all microorganisms are bad and so the key is to understand how they change and impact us,"" explains Ott, who also found that the infectious bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, which causes a range of symptoms from boils to food poisoning, may not increase in virulence like Salmonella in microgravity. By understanding the changes in Salmonella and other disease-causing bacteria in microgravity, Nickerson hopes to not only keep crew healthy but also help humans down on Earth through the development of drugs and vaccines. ""Infections are becoming harder to treat; we have no vaccine for Salmonella food poisoning and it remains [one of] the leading cause of bacterial food-borne illness worldwide,"" states Nickerson. Spaceflight opens up a new world of research that can't take place on Earth and Nickerson has unmasked key changes in the behavior of genes in the bacteria which aren't usually seen under gravity. ""Vaccines are about identifying targets and in microgravity the bacteria have unmasked themselves and revealed secrets to help develop therapeutics."" Sustaining life in space . The research is in its early stages but it's just one example of how bacteria are being investigated by space agencies. Far from just a health hazard, bacteria could be used to help sustain astronauts in space, as a source of food and oxygen. ""The major advantage to using bacteria is the size of them,"" explains Christophe Lasseur, coordinator of life support research and development at the European Space Agency (ESA). ""For space missions the mass of oxygen, food, and water is high and not compatible with current launch technologies. A crew of six to Mars would need over 30 tons."" Lasseur directs the MELLiSSA programme at ESA, which aims to develop a regenerative life-support ecosystem for use on board spacecraft. ""We need to recycle everything for an ecosystem that can sustain human life,"" says Lasseur. The team wants to recycle 80% of all mass on board, including carbon dioxide, which can become toxic if allowed to build up. Key algae and bacteria can mop up carbon dioxide and in turn release oxygen to enable astronauts to breathe. ""We have approached this molecule by molecule, first oxygen, then water and now food, which is more complex,"" says Lasseur. The chosen range of bacteria not only utilize carbon dioxide but can also harness other human waste products, such as urine and feces -- a win-win given their growth results in food for the astronauts. Eating bacteria grown on urine may not sound like a delicacy, and it isn't, which is why psychology also comes into play. ""Our most advanced work is using spirulina as this has been used as a protein source for many centuries and in many countries, making it much more psychologically acceptable,"" explains Lasseur. Spirulina is a cyanobacterium found in many salt water lakes and is consumed readily by lake communities. The edible bacterium is also marketed as a health supplement. In the search for bacteria that feed on our food waste, Lasseur's team discovered a hidden gem that has an additional medical benefit -- helping to fight cholesterol. ""We were looking for bacteria which use a lot of carbon and nitrogen as there's a lot of this in waste disposal,"" states Lasseur. The resulting use of Rhodospirillum rubrum led to a nutritious product found to produce significantly lower levels of cholesterol in mice and will soon be marketed by spin-off company EzCOL BV, which is in talks with big pharma. This bacterium has been by-passed in favor of more nutritious alternatives for consumption by astronauts but the research to get there has borne beneficial fruit for those of us not venturing up into space. As for the astronauts, Mars missions could be a reality in the, albeit distant, future. And when the day comes, crews could depart feeling confident of reaching the red planet well fed, watered and free of infection.","A key challenge of manned space missions is keeping crews healthy .

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- The ever-popular HBO series ""Sex and the City"" is rarely thought of as a workplace show, but if we take a closer look, we can see it is riddled with workplace clichés. Carrie Bradshaw, our main gal, somehow makes an extravagant living from one weekly newspaper column she often writes in her underwear while smoking what seems to be a smokeless cigarette inside her New York City apartment. Miranda Hobbes, a ""busy"" corporate lawyer never seems too busy for lunches, parties, shopping or long walks around the city with best pal Carrie. Charlotte York is a museum curator who rarely curates anything but her obsession with finding Mr. Right and having Mr. Right, Jr. Finally, but certainly not least in any sense of the word, Samantha Jones is a successful public relations practitioner despite a reputation the size of New York City itself. How ironic. Recently, over on the humor website, Cracked.com, one writer was fed up with the annoying clichés about women that keep popping up in movies. Tired of seeing gorgeous actresses playing the supposedly unattractive sister and an unrealistic emphasis on the glories of shopping, Christina H. penned ""6 obnoxious assumptions Hollywood makes about women."" The list is not only funny but also accurate if you stop and think about how many movies these annoying tropes occur in. It also got us thinking that Hollywood's not just inaccurately portraying women in movies or on TV -- it's off the mark about what it's like for the average worker in today's economy. As a result, we bring you 6 ways Hollywood lies to us about the workplace... 1. All the beautiful people . Ever notice all the long-legged, luscious haired, model-types walking around your office? What about all of the strapping, buff and impeccably dressed men? We didn't think so. Hollywood can often make it seem like unattractive, overweight or simple-humored people don't work. Skills? Who needs 'em, right? As long as you look good and utter funny, clever remarks all day, you're bound to grow business and make bushels of money. Sure statistics exist regarding attractive people getting hired over, promoted instead of or paid more than unattractive ones, but these people also have skills, education or the ability to move business in some significant way. A pretty face might help, but if that's all you got, it's not going to cut it in the real world. Hollywood examples: The In Crowd, Confessions of a Shopaholic, Grey's Anatomy . 2. Executives work? Nah... The Sarah Jessica Parker movie ""I Don't Know How She Does It"" in which she plays the role of an international fund manager, wife and mother, portrays an unrealistic schedule for such an executive-level job. Christina Gombar, author of fiction, memoir and literary criticism says, ""No way, no way, no way, would an international fund manager get into work at 9 a.m. She would be working around the clock with her terminal from home. She wouldn't have time to shoot snarky emails to her female work mates. My pals who are traders can't talk to me on the phone and can only send the shortest texts."" Beverly Solomon, a marketer, creative director and author based in Austin, Texas believes Hollywood portrays executives and entrepreneurs as ""rich, uncaring crooks who made their fortunes by stepping on the regular people."" Solomon, having worked for Diane Von Furstenberg and Ralph Lauren, looks down on this cliché, noting ""both were great entrepreneurs who built their businesses with vision and tenacity, and are good people."" Hollywood examples: You've Got Mail, Be Kind Rewind, Wall Street . 3. Your outfit? Anything goes! A suit? Slacks? Minimal cleavage? That's crazy talk. According to Hollywood, club wear is quite suitable for the workplace, and even welcome. How else do you plan to get that big promotion or spark up that all-appropriate office romance? Christina McCale, marketing academic, career coach and co-editor of ""Start Your Internet Business: 36 Things You Need to Know"" says, ""While Millennials are changing a lot of things about the way we dress in the workplace, the reality is there is still a level of professionalism expected, and usually, that isn't reflected in 'Britney-esque' outfits."" McCale cautions you should always remember who your boss is. ""They're not likely to appreciate you wearing club wear to the office meeting. And even more likely -- they won't take you seriously."" Hollywood examples: My Boss's Daughter, View from the Top, Legally Blonde . 4. Work is so easy . ""The common [so-called 'webpreneurial'] storyline on TV shows or movies goes like this: person gets idea; they set up a website; next day money is rolling in,"" says McCale. Citing another unrealistic example, she adds, ""Crime scene investigators strategically hold up flashlights, miraculously evidence appears. The reality is CSIs across the country aren't exactly running around in Louis Vuitton shoes. CSI work is hard, and many crime labs are not nearly as well equipped as the ones you see on TV."" On TV and in movies, people make more witty remarks than they complete important projects. They hang out all day, barely ever sitting at a computer or on a phone call. Pranks are a regular part of the work day, and talking to the boss in the same way you talk to your poker buddies is acceptable. In today's economy, it's hard to imagine anyone's workday is that carefree. Hollywood examples: The Office, 30 Rock, Clerks, Will & Grace . 5. Money is no object . Wouldn't it be nice to live in a movie or TV sitcoms where you can be an out of work-actor, waitress or writer and still live in a lavish New York City apartment, buy $500 Louis Vuittons, sip on warm delights in a coffee shop all day, and barely ever go to work? TV shows like ""Friends"" and ""Sex and the City,"" and characters like Rachel Green, Joey Tribbiani and Carrie Bradshaw give us the false hope that we can actually work little and live a lot. In a post-recession economy, many workers are deciding how often they can afford to buy coffee each week, but you don't see that on TV. Hollywood examples: The 40 Year Old Virgin, Cheers, The Real Housewives [of any city], Modern Family . 6. Your boss is a horrible person and/or an idiot . You've probably had a boss that wasn't the brightest bulb or even the nicest person you've ever met, but he or she wasn't necessarily worthless. In fact, unless you've had an unfortunate run of luck, your bosses probably ranged from OK people to great leaders. Your average Hollywood bosses, however, either exist to make your life miserable with outrageous demands and endless piles of work, or they're incompetent fools who can barely tie their own shoes much less manage a team. ""While there are always going to be bosses who are -- ""clueless"" -- [it's] not a good idea to point that out to them,"" says McCale. ""Worse, don't make how you -- ""feel they are clueless"" -- obvious in front of others."" Hollywood examples: The Devil Wears Prada, Horrible Bosses, Nine to Five . Why it matters . ""The shame is, many teens and 20-somethings base career choices on what they see on TV, and TV just isn't a great career counselor because shows aren't meant to do that,"" says McCale. ""TV and movies are entertainment. They are geared for a shorter attention span, and to use elements of truth to propel a storyline forward."" While work can be fun, and some companies might have a more informal working environment than others, you might not want to model your workplace behavior after what you see on TV and in movies. &copy CareerBuilder.com 2011.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Tangled thickets and thirsty mosquitoes safeguard the secret of Koon Wing Chan. Less than two kilometers from the mainland Chinese border, in a quiet shadowy grove by a local village, sits a rare 200-year-old wild incense tree. ""No one in this village even knows that this is an incense tree -- except me,"" says the 54-year old Chan. ""I love these trees because I grew up with them."" He wants to ensure his two young sons do as well. Officially known as Aquilaria sinensis, ""agarwood"" was once a common commodity, but is now rare because of illegal logging. Chan has been trying to change that. Over the past four years, he has planted 10,000 new trees on Hong Kong's only incense plantation, part of a family business passed on to him from his father and grandfather. All told, the plantation has some 300,000 incense trees. ""My grandfather was the one in the family who started planting these incense trees back in the day,"" reminisces Chan. ""When I was young, I followed him up into the hills to help. Now, I see a lot of incense trees in Hong Kong have been logged, so I want to preserve them."" While incense tree conservation is one of Chan's motivations, a lucrative livelihood is another. Chan explains he can sell a sapling for as much as $600. The 10,000 trees he planted could mean millions if he were to sell. But if left to mature at least 10 years, the trees can be an even bigger moneymaker once harvested -- supplying incense powder, fragrant wood used in herbal teas as well as traditional Chinese medicines with anti-inflammatory properties. The wood itself can command a hefty sum. Chan says one arms-length carving can command $125,000. He adds his buyers usually come from Taiwan and mainland China after they learn of his business through word of mouth or through his website. But because of its high price and limited supply, the incense tree has also become a victim of its own value. Mainland Chinese loggers are to blame, says Professor Chi-Yung Jim, chairman of the geography department at the University of Hong Kong. ""They would come here -- of course illegally - usually in a fast boat at night. They would land and then climb into the hills, and stay there to actually set up some kind of rudimentary camp - and even cook there,"" explains Jim. ""And then they would systematically find these trees. Its value is comparable to gold, but of course, we are talking about the highest quality."" Over the past 90 years, Wing Lee Sandalwood has been legally trading in that quality. Long, slender aromatic joss sticks line the shop's walls. An incense burner sits by the entrance, puffing out a smoky scent to passersby. The most expensive incense wood sells for $2500 per kilogram. About once a month, employees hand roll incense sticks from scratch -- starting with incense power, water and secret, trade ingredients. Business has been bustling, says employee Li Hua Peng. ""In the past five years, I can see from my shop that there are more customers buying incense wood. The most popular products are the ones that are used for worshipping gods."" In fact, incense is primarily used for prayer and how Hong Kong got its name. Hundreds of years ago, this city served as a regional supplier of scents -- an Asian hub for aromatic affairs. ""Hong"" means fragrant in the local Cantonese language. ""Kong"" means harbor. In the meantime, Chan hopes people will not forget the city's heritage as he nurtures the city's last incense plantation to save the ""Hong"" of Hong Kong. ""I hope my incense trees can grow bigger and be everywhere. Even though Hong Kong is urbanizing I think more trees can and should be planted."" Vivian Kam contributed to this story .","Hong Kong plantation has 300,000 incense trees, but are increasingly rare .

"Cologne, Germany (CNN) -- More than 340,000 gamers from across Europe converged in this quaint German city last month to get their first hands-on with Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One consoles and to preview an assortment of new games. The occasion was Gamescom, the massive video gaming show that attracted over 600 exhibitors from upwards of 80 countries, all of whom set up booths in 10 massive halls that featured over 1.4 million square feet of space. It was like E3 and Comic-Con, only much bigger. Big companies like Sony, Microsoft, Ubisoft and Electronic Arts kicked off the festivities with press conferences that featured exclusive announcements, including the November 15 PS4 launch date and new games such as ""The Sims 4."" Europe plays an important role in the global gaming ecosystem, thanks to the success of such European companies as Rovio Entertainment (""Angry Birds""), DICE (""Battlefield 4"") and TT Games (""The LEGO Movie Game""). According to Peter Warman, founder of video-game research firm Newzoo, European consumers will contribute 23% of the $70.4 billion global video game market this year. ""The most talked-about companies over the past year are European,"" said Warman. ""Companies like SuperCell (""Clash of Clans""), Wargaming (""World of Tanks""), Mojang (""Minecraft"") and King (""Candy Crush"") will bring in a combined revenue of more than $1.5 billion this year."" Next-generation gaming was a huge focus this year, but the current crop of consoles still have a lot of life left in them. And the PC, which has always been strong in Europe, remains a force as well. Here are five games that stood out from the very crowded booths of Gamescom 2013. 'Fighter Within' -- Ubisoft/Daoka; Xbox One; Fall 2013 . Developer Daoka is making the most of the new Xbox One Kinect technology with this fighting game, which you control by moving your arms and legs. Thanks to the enhanced motion sensors and tracking capabilities, players' moves are represented on a one-to-one basis within the game. This means that every punch, kick and counter in the real world will be faithfully replicated. Players can choose from an assortment of fighters, each with distinct and authentic fighting styles and special moves. The game supports two-player competitive play, which means friends will be standing next to one another in the real world while they pummel their opponent in the virtual one. 'The Sims 4' -- Electronic Arts/EA Maxis; PC; 2014 . With over 175 million copies of ""The Sims"" sold so far, EA Maxis is making this simulation franchise more life-like than ever before by utilizing new technology. The franchise has evolved over the years to incorporate more human behaviors into its virtual characters. Each Sim now has a rich emotional center that drives meaningful social interactions with those they interact with. Players can explore deeper stories with these more human simulations. Gameplay revolves around life's tragedies and triumphs, with the ability to customize everything from Sims' homes to their lifetime aspirations. The core game mechanics have worked for over a decade now. The genius has been adding new gameplay and content, through expansion packs and sequels, and making the connections between human and Sim evolve over time. 'Dead Island Epidemic' -- Deep Silver/Stunlock Studios; PC; TBD . Developer Stunlock Studios is expanding Techland's popular zombie franchise by exploring a new genre with this free-to-play PC MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) game, which strands players on a tropical island overrun with zombies. Three teams of four players will battle against each other over control of strategic positions. There will also be a wide assortment of zombies and undead creatures to contend with, the larger ones requiring all three teams to work together. Players can customize their own weapons from hundreds of items they collect in the game, making for a unique action-packed experience. This game stands out from the very crowded MOBA genre (""Dota 2,"" ""League of Legends,"" ""Heroes of Newerth,"" ""Infinite Crisis"") with its rare combination of zombies and over-the-top action. 'Fable Legends' -- Microsoft/Lionhead Studios; Xbox One; TBD . Lionhead Studios returns to the fantasy world of Albion with this Xbox One-exclusive adventure. For the first time, up to four players can embark on quests together as they build their characters, explore photorealistic lands and face off against monsters and assorted bad guys. The game's been designed for seamless solo play as well. For the first time in the franchise, players can forgo their heroic calling and become a villain instead -- complete with an army of minions. The game utilizes the Xbox Smartglass experience through any tablet by opening up a second screen on which villains can battle heroes while sitting next to each other on the couch. 'The Order: 1886' -- Sony/Ready at Dawn; PlayStation 4; TBD . One of the more unique next-generation action games on display at Gamescom, ""The Order"" provides an alternate vision of Victorian-era London. Players join an elite order of knights and jump into a centuries-old battle between good and evil in this PS4 exclusive. The game's world blends real historical figures, places and events with myths like the Arthurian legend. Developer Ready at Dawn has brought advanced Industrial Revoluton weaponry to the fray, allowing players to better fight mysterious supernatural enemies. The entire experience has a cinematic feel, and the game's presentation even replicates the texture of film. With its foreboding atmosphere and action-heavy gameplay, ""The Order"" stands out from the crowd.","Here are 5 games to watch from the recent Gamescom show .

"(CNN) -- Remember the good ol' days, circa mid-naughts, when most people's phones just alerted them of incoming calls and the occasional text message? After a two-second peek, you knew that you were not in desperate demand, and you were free to slip your cell back into your pocket or purse (or cell phone holster, if you were a huge geek). You'd then go back to standing in line, taking in a raucous concert or attending your grandma Bunny's funeral. Now we're more stupidly available, and a phone check involves, at minimum, viewing your e-mails, scanning Twitter mentions, perusing blog comments and stalking that dude's Facebook wall. Even if there's nothing remarkable in any digi-venue, we keep tapping away -- reading the latest headlines, checking the weather (often, bafflingly, while outside or near a window) or ordering the most darling collectible Hummel set from eBay. You know, the usual. Last year, a study even hinted that fresh bits of info may hook into the brain's reward system, shedding light on how whipping out your phone is analogous to that whiskey-and-taco bender you went on last weekend. (It just hurts so gooooood.) The problem, of course, is that constantly perusing your phone is freaking rude -- a clear signal that your reception is more important than anything going on in the here and now. Get this: 10 percent of people 24 and younger think it's OK to text during sex, according to consumer electronics shopping and review site Retrevo. That brings a whole meaning to the term multitasking. But unless you're among that ADD-addled 10 percent, there's hope for you yet. May we suggest holsterin' the old communication cannon during the following situations: . At a restaurant . Putting your phone screen-up on the table is like ordering dessert -- one person does it and everyone else follows suit. Never mind that phones do not belong amidst tableware. As soon as a text pops up or a call comes through, everyone else at the table is trapped in conversational limbo while you have your own digital tete-a-tete. If you must remain imminently reachable, simply make a big show out of it: ""I'm so sorry to have to keep my phone out. Jess is supposed to get here soon, and I don't want to miss her."" The others will get the point. Either that, or they'll stick you with the bill. Don't worry, you'll likely be too distracted by Foursquare to notice. On the sidewalk . It's one thing to walk and talk with your phone glued to your ear. Research finds that you're more likely to get run over while yakking, but hey, that's a risk you take. However, tucking your chin to your chest and staggering along whilst reviewing your Match.com updates or checking the Facebook RSVP list for your ""America's Got Talent"" viewing party is both stupid (cars!) and obnoxious. It's all about spatial awareness: Those who walk-n-surf tend to weave to and fro, making them impossible to pass on crowded or skinny sidewalks. Park yourself out of the current and against a wall, finish your phone time and pocket your cell before re-entering the deadened, zombified stream of pedestrian humanity. Special request to those of you who live in subway-arteried cities: I know you're super eager to breach fresh air and burst into the service zone, but for heaven's sake, wait until you've crested the stairs to turn your attention to your mobile. Your slow climb is pissing off scads of already addled public transportation users. One day they will push you to your death, and all those shuffling aforementioned zombies will likely trample you under their distracted soles. When cool stuff is happening . Manners aside, here's the big danger with packing every spare moment with a cybercheck: Eventually, idle but perfectly interesting moments (sitting on a park bench, people-watching at a café) become excuses to busy yourself with your touch screen. Remember that iconic New Yorker cover from last Halloween? Clever, sure. Terrifying, absolutely. Soapbox, prepare to be climbed: Challenge yourself to go a week without using your data plan. Pretend you're on vacation overseas and can't afford the rate. Turn off Push and Fetch and all the other emphatic verbs that bring inane Facebook updates and new e-mails to your attention like a cat proudly dropping an especially fresh rodent at your feet. Stick to phone calls and texting and check everything else exclusively from a computer. You'll see passersby, not pixels, when you're riding in a car; squirrels, not a screen, when you're waiting outside to meet a friend. And you'll make the liberating (albeit depressing) discovery that when you fire up your e-mail again, the world has continued to swivel without your immediate viewage of e-coupons from Suave and that cat video from Uncle Bob. Those are best dealt with when you're at your desk and supposedly working anyway.","Phones do not belong on the table at restaurants, CNN.com's netiquette columnists say .

"Washington (CNN) -- The glitch-plagued rollout of President Barack Obama's signature health care law has been dogged by one big question: How many people have enrolled in an insurance plan? The White House refuses to release the numbers, leading many to assume they are embarrassingly low. But insurance industry insiders point to another reason: Nobody knows if the numbers they do have are even accurate. Turns out, some insurance companies say they are receiving data from the administration that is incomplete, duplicative or contradictory, making it difficult to get an accurate count of new enrollment. Opinion: Why healthcare.gov has so many problems . So far, most of the attention has focused on people being unable to sign up for coverage through online health care exchanges. But even when customers manage to make it through the enrollment process, glitches persist. ""The administration is not wrong in saying that there's been a lot of problems with signing up. But it's incorrect to say that's the only problem,"" an insurance industry official said. ""That's not the only issue at hand."" Industry officials who were contacted requested anonymity to speak candidly because of the superheated politics surrounding Obamacare. Opinion: Will glitches derail Obamacare? The sign-up process works this way: A person sets up an online account, verifies an identity, applies for coverage and subsidies and, if eligible, shops and enrolls for a plan. Once completed, information is sent to the insurance plans selected by the user. At 6 p.m. each day, the government sends the latest batch of new enrollees to insurance companies. But sometimes that data come with conflicting information, showing for instance, someone who enrolled and then canceled a plan, said an insurance industry executive. Other times data come in without a time stamp, making it difficult to track, the executive said. Adding to the confusion, the executive said, is that people are not officially enrolled in a plan until they pay their first premiums, which are not due until December 15. That means shoppers have about two months to cancel or switch plans before making a final decision of whether or not to enroll. Success on day 14 of Obamacare website . An administration official did not dispute there have been problems with data sent by the government to insurers. ""We know that people are enrolling in coverage and the system works. As individual problems are raised by insurers, we work aggressively to address them,"" said Joanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services. An HHS official said enrollment numbers will likely be released in mid-November, giving officials time to verify their accuracy. Former Obama press secretary Robert Gibbs had harsh words for the administration, saying the October 1 rollout was ""bungled badly."" ""I hope they're working day and night to get this done, and when they get it fixed, I hope they fire some people that were in charge of making sure this thing was supposed to work,"" Gibbs said Monday on MSNBC. 'Cumbersome, glitchy' system . So far, the buzz in the insurance industry is that enrollment numbers are falling short of projections. One insurance company executive put it this way, ""The numbers aren't as bad as the doomsday people would say. But so far, they're low and they have people worried.""","White House hasn't released numbers on enrollment, leading many to assume it's low .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi's sixth hat-trick of 2010 helped Barcelona demolish Almeria 8-0 on Saturday night, but three goals from Cristiano Ronaldo kept Real Madrid on top in Spain ahead of next Monday's ""Clasico"" clash between the La Liga giants. Messi reached the milestone of 100 league goals for Barcelona in just 154 appearances for the defending champions, and has already scored 22 this season in all competitions. His third goal briefly lifted him above Ronaldo as the league's top scorer on 13, putting the visitors seven up before the Argentine laid on substitute Bojan Krkic's second goal with 17 minutes to play. Barcelona led 5-0 at the halftime break, with Messi breaking the deadlock in the 17th minute after combining well with David Villa. Andres Iniesta made it 2-0 a minute later after woeful defending by Almeria, with his misplaced cross fortuitously rebounding back into his path, then Peru defender Wilmer Acasiete turned Maxwell's low cross into his own net on 27. Pedro embarrassed the onrushing Diego Alves eight minutes later as he easily won the race to a long ball in the 35th minute, then soon after Messi netted from the winger's low cross at the second attempt after the goalkeeper parried his first. Messi helped set up Bojan's first in the 62nd minute, with the 20-year-old showing nimble feet before dinking the ball over Alves. The beleaguered Alves could only parry Villa's shot into Messi's pass for the seventh, and Bojan made no mistake when sent free down the middle to seal the biggest win of the Spanish season so far and leave Almeria in the bottom three. The home side had conceded only 10 goals in 11 games -- the third best defensive record in the league behind Real and Barcelona -- but coach Juan Manuel Lillo was sacked after the match. Barcelona travel to Greece on Wednesday to face Panathinaikos in the Champions League, then host Real in a Monday fixture forced due to security concerns over the Catalan elections that weekend. Real Madrid will take a one-point lead into that match following the 5-1 victory at home to Athletic Bilbao in the late match, as coach Jose Mourinho completed his two-match touchline ban. With the Portuguese boss watching from various positions in the stands, Real almost went behind in just the second minute when defender Pepe had to clear off the line from Fernando Llorente. But Gonzalo Higuain put Real ahead in the 19th minute with a clinical low finish after fellow Argentine Angel Di Maria slipped a low pass into the penalty area, and Ronaldo doubled the lead on the half-hour after Mesut Ozil cleverly knocked the ball into his path. Spain striker Llorente reduced the deficit five minutes before halftime from close range with his ninth league goal of the season, but Real restored their two-goal buffer 11 minutes after the break. Di Maria duped Markel Susaeta into bringing him down just inside the box, and defender Sergio Ramos surprisingly stepped up to smash home the resulting penalty for his first goal of the campaign. Ronaldo effectively sealed the win in the 62nd minute with a swerving free-kick that wrongfooted goalkeeper Gorka Iraizoz could only palm into his net. The Portugal forward then netted his 15th league goal this season -- and 17th overall -- from the penalty spot in time added on after substitute Esteban Granero was brought down, despite having to retake the kick after illegally stopping in his initial run-up. Bilbao, who hit the bar through Javi Martinez in the 87th minute, were left in ninth place -- 16 points behind Real. Villarreal retained third place after coming from behind to earn a 1-1 draw at home to 10-man Valencia, who stayed fourth. Aritz Aduriz put Valencia ahead in the 20th minute with a deflected shot as Villarreal -- who had won all five previous home matches this season -- conceded at El Madrigal for just the second time. Italy forward Giuseppe Rossi gave his side a lifeline in the 73rd minute with a volley for his eighth La Liga goal of the campaign as his team now trail Real by eight points. Valencia lost Lithuania defender Marius Stankevicius to a second yellow card with 10 minutes to go, but held on for the draw ahead of Wednesday's Champions League clash with Turkish side Bursaspor.","Real Madrid stay one point clear in Spain after beating Athletic Bilbao 5-1 .

"(CNN) -- It was the long goodbye as China bid farewell to its sporting heroine in a tearful ceremony. Li Na had announced last month at the age of 32 her career was over, that her recurring knee problems would keep her off the court once and for all. And at the start of the China Open at Beijing's National Tennis Center Asia's first grand slam singles champion was lauded by peers, Chinese celebrities and the wider public in a special ceremony. In all, 40 WTA players were on court for the ceremony, which reached its climax as world No.2 Rafa Nadal, moments after winning on his own return from injury, presented the player with flowers alongside her husband Jiang Shan. The 14-time Grand Slam champion had previously tweeted: ""Congratulations for your career and I wish you all the best in your new life #LoveLi."" Li reached a career-best ranking of second earlier this year shortly after her victory at the Australian Open. She had previously become her continent's first grand slam winner at the 2011 French Open, one of nine WTA career singles titles. But having not played since Wimbledon, she decided to retire. Now, she plans to start a family and also set up her own tennis academy but admitted: ""I was sad because tennis was with me for 24 years"". Caroline Wozniacki, Jelena Jankovic and Petra Kvitova were among the players on court to wipe away the tears, Wimbledon champion Kvitova leading the tributes. ""The most important thing I want to say is thank you for being our opponent, thank you for being our inspiration and thank you for being our friend. We will miss you, champion,"" said Kvitova. WTA chairman Stacey Allaster also paid tribute adding: ""You're a true champion and pioneer, who has made such a difference in so many people's lives. You are the player of this decade, who has made the most impact and growth on women's tennis.""","Tennis says its goodbyes to Li Na in a tear-jerking ceremony in Beijing, China .

"(CNN) -- China's population may be in excess of 1.3 billion inhabitants but only two of its players had ever reached a grand slam semifinal -- until Tuesday. That was when unseeded Peng Shuai put years of frustration, thoughts of retirement and major heart surgery to one side as she blew away Swiss teen Belinda Bencic at the U.S. Open. At her 37th grand slam, the 28-year-old was finally into her first semifinals. The buildup had mainly focused on the 17-year-old Bencic but it was the little known Peng -- far more recognized as a doubles player -- who stole the show with a powerful display. By so doing, she follows in the footsteps of Li Na, a two-time grand slam winner, and Zheng Jie, who reached semifinals at Wimbledon (2008) and the Australian Open (2010). ""It's a little bit too exciting,"" Peng said on court after her 6-2 6-1 victory, earning a round of applause after pausing as emotion got the better of her. ""I love tennis, I love to play."" That much is clear from her back story. Aged 12, Peng went against her family wishes to undergo a major operation to repair a fault in her heart. The procedure was so complicated surgeons had to access her heart through her left leg but as Peng made clear in a 2008 advertisement, there was one fundamental reason she went through with it. ""All I thought was very simple: if I want to continue tennis, I need to have this operation,"" she said in the Adidas advert. Nearly two decades later, her tenacity was rewarded when she achieved the No. 1 ranking in doubles. By so doing, she became the first Chinese to ever achieve top spot -- whether in singles or doubles, male or female. Despite the ranking, a player who has never won a singles title revealed she had been wracked by doubts in recent times. ""A career is tough sometimes,"" said Peng in victory. ""I've thought about giving up, stopping playing (singles), because I didn't know if I can make it, but my coach and parents told me to never give up."" With her two-fisted ground strokes proving too much for a rattled Bencic, the youngest U.S. Open quarterfinalist since 1997, Peng hit 24 winners. Although Zheng was the first Chinese player to reach a grand slam semifinal, world No. 3 Li has taken the country's tennis further. She won its first singles grand slam at the 2011 French Open, before clinching a second title at this year's Australian Open. No Chinese woman has ever reached the U.S. Open singles final, a record that Peng -- who has won two grand slam doubles titles in the last year -- will try to correct on Thursday. She will meet 2009 finalist Caroline Wozniacki, who continued her career resurgence by crushing Italian 13th seed Sara Errani 6-0 6-1 later Tuesday. The former world No. 1, who has a 5-1 career record over Peng, reached the last four of a grand slam for the first time since 2011, also in New York. ""She was much stronger than me physically tonight,"" said Errani, a semifinalist in 2012. ""She doesn't let you play. She never misses. ""And every point was a long point, and it made me feel worse, physically."" Serena Williams is in action on Wednesday against Italy's Flavia Pennetta, but she suffered a frustrating day on Tuesday. Not only did she lose her doubles quarterfinal with sister Venus to Russian pair Ekaterina Makarova and Elena Vesnina, but she also suffered an injury scare. The world No. 1's right foot had to be heavily bandaged early in the second set of the 7-6 6-4 defeat. In the men's event, second seed Roger Federer marched into the quarterfinals for the 10th time in the last 11 years with an aggressive 6-4 6-3 6-2 win over Spanish 17th seed Roberto Bautista Agut. The five-time U.S. champion, seeking his first final appearance since losing the 2009 title match, came to the net 50 times as he comfortably set up a clash with French 20th seed Gael Monfils. ""I'm happy I'm able to come forward now because coming to net requires a lot of agility and explosiveness, and I have it back,"" said the veteran 17-time grand slam winner. He has a 7-2 record over Monfils, beating him in three sets on the way to winning the Cincinnati title last month. ""I know exactly how I need to play him,"" Federer said. ""I know I'll be coming in; he knows he'll be defending. He'll be wanting to serve well and play big as well."" Monfils, known for his all-action style, was in impressive form as he overcame a sluggish Grigor Dimitrov 7-5 7-6 (8-6) 7-5 to reach the quarterfinals at Flushing Meadows for a third time. Sixth seed Tomas Berdych will play Croatia's Marin Cilic in the quarterfinals, after the Czech beat Austria's Dominic Thiem 6-1 6-2 6-4. Cilic, seeded 14th, came from behind to beat Richard Gasquet 5-7 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 3-6 6-3, avenging his five-set defeat by the Frenchman at January's Australian Open. In Wednesday's opening quarterfinals, Australian Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka takes on Japanese 10th seed Kei Nishikori, then in the late session world No. 1 Novak Djokovic plays Andy Murray in a repeat of the 2012 title match.","Peng Shuai becomes only third Chinese player to reach a grand slam semifinal .

"(CNN) -- The head of one of America's biggest animal protection organizations said Thursday that Michael Vick, who served prison time for his role in a deadly dogfighting operation, should have the opportunity to bring a dog home -- in due time. Humane Society of the United States President Wayne Pacelle told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell that the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback shouldn't get a pet immediately and should have to meet certain milestones whenever he does. But Pacelle, whose group has worked with Vick in public outreach efforts, said that it would be wrong to close the door to his ever having a dog again. ""He's been going through counseling, he's been speaking to kids twice a month, and he needs to interact with animals,"" said Pacelle. ""If he continues to hit these markers, then if his daughter wants a dog two or three years down the line,... I'm saying that we should be open to that possibility."" Under the terms of his conviction, Vick is currently barred from owning an animal. But the Newport News, Virginia, native this week told The Grio, a news website focused on an African-American audience, that he would ""love to have another dog in the future."" ""I think it would be a great step in my rehabilitation process,"" Vick said. ""Just to have a pet in my household and show people that I genuinely care, (to show) my love and my passion for animals, I think, would be outstanding."" Jim Gorant, the author of the book ""The Lost Dogs"" about the animals that were killed and those that survived from the ring that Vick belonged to, questions the extent of Vick's love for animals given his conviction. ""It's a common thing among dogfighters: In one sentence, they'll talk about how much they love these dogs, and the next sentence they'll talk about how they force them to fight,"" the author told HLN's Velez-Mitchell. ""It's hard to take him at face value, (given) what he's done,"" added Gorant. ""He was arms deep in this process of abusing and killing these animals."" The NFL indefinitely suspended Vick in August 2007 after he pleaded guilty to a federal charge of bankrolling a dogfighting operation in Virginia. Vick left a Kansas prison in May 2009 to serve the last two months of his 23-month sentence in home confinement. The Humane Society, which claims support from 11 million people, bills itself on its website as the country's ""mainstream force against cruelty, exploitation and neglect"" of animals -- including the very kind of dogfighting rings and killings for which Vick was convicted. After being released, Pacelle said that Vick approached the group ""to help ... combat that problem."" The society president defended his group's partnership with Vick, saying that it has helped spur a new conversation about the reality of dogfighting. Pacelle said that the quarterback has personally talked with thousands of children regarding an issue he first learned about as an adolescent, helping start a dialogue that's led to animal protection clubs popping up at several inner-city schools. ""What he did is terrible, there's no question about that,"" Pacelle said. ""But this is an issue of protecting animals in the future. And endlessly flogging Michael Vick is not going to save one animal. But putting him to work in communities to save animals and educate people about the problem of dogfighting -- especially with at-risk kids -- is the way to help the problem."" ""Thousands now are being reached,"" he added. ""We've never had a conversation with them before."" Vick's off-the-field past has done little to diminish his popularity on the field. According to NFL.com, he currently ranks first in fan voting for the 2011 Pro Bowl -- above all other players, at all other positions. Still, Vick has acknowledged publicly that his rehabilitation is not yet complete. And as much as Vick might potentially save some dogs by making the public more aware of fighting rings, Pacelle said that having him interact with dogs should benefit Vick personally. The Humane Society plans for public interactions at first, during which he might even attend ""end dogfighting classes"" with others. ""Animals have a healing quality to them,"" Pacelle said.","Humane Society President Wayne Pacelle says he's open to Michael Vick having a dog .

"(CNN) -- When Bobbi Brown introduced her eponymous lipstick line to Bergdorf Goodman back in 1991, she never expected all 10 pinky-brown shades to fly off the shelves in just one day. Since then, the trailblazing makeup mogul has built a billion-dollar empire by making women look and feel beautiful in a natural way. Her cosmetics adorn the faces of VIPs such as Michelle Obama and Katie Holmes, as well as the Duchess of Cambridge, who wore the brand on her wedding day. With stores in 68 countries today, the company has grown from a mail-order business in the early 90s to a staple in women's makeup bags from London to Beijing. ""When I started the company, my mission was to make a lipstick that looked like lips, because most of the lipsticks on the market looked artificial, they were greasy and they smelled bad,"" Brown told CNN's Poppy Harlow. ""I wanted to create something that looked natural, and that worked with a woman's skin tone and her lip color,"" she adds. Brown's love affair with makeup started as she watched her mother's beauty rituals in their suburban Chicago home. But her true entrepreneurial streak came from her Russian immigrant grandfather, who worked his way up to become a successful car dealer: ""I grew up watching Papa Sam in his dealership and I learned so much. He was an amazing role model,"" she says. School was never the focus of Brown's attention, and when she wanted to drop out of the University of Arizona after her first year, her mother asked her a question that would determine the course of her life: ""If you could spend the day doing whatever you wanted, what would you do?"" ""Go to the mall and play with makeup,"" came the answer. After earning a degree in theatrical makeup at Emerson College in Boston, Brown moved to New York City, showing her portfolio to anyone and everyone. Living the life of a fledgling makeup artist, her talent and perseverance paid off. Soon she was working on high-profile magazine shoots, eventually landing a Vogue cover with Naomi Campbell -- her first big break. ""I'll never forget it,"" recalls Brown. ""It was Naomi Campbell's first cover and the photographer was Patrick Demarchelier. It was shot on the beach early in the morning, and you never know if it's a cover or not, but when I heard it was, I was beyond (excited),"" she says. While her makeup artist career was burgeoning, Brown was frustrated by the lack of wearable, natural looking shades amid the fuchsia lipsticks and electric blue eye shadows which dominated the 1980s: ""Everything was artificial and fake. It just did not look right to me,"" she says. A chance meeting with a Kiehl's pharmacist during a fashion shoot led to the creation of her first lipstick, Brown Lip Color, in her signature chocolate-based tones. Four years later, the company she started with just $10,000 was beating cosmetics giant Estee Lauder in major department stores. Brown soon got a call from Leonard Lauder, the scion of the makeup empire started by his mother Estee, offering to buy her company. She accepted, under the condition that she retained all creative control, and today it is estimated that Bobbi Brown products account for about 10% of all Estee Lauder sales. ""You know, I think that women will always need their basics,"" Brown says, explaining how her business managed to weather the financial downturn of recent years. ""They will always need their tried and tested things, they are not going to forgo makeup. Maybe they'll forgo the trendy things that come out every season, they don't need it. But most women still need what they need,"" she adds. When it comes to her role in an industry which has been heavily criticized for making women feel self-conscious, Brown says: ""Everyone I know in the beauty industry, not just the people that work in my company, is really there to make products that make women look and feel better, they devote their lives to it. I think the biggest problem is that the Internet now shows everything. So if you are going to be an actress or a supermodel, you are unusually photogenic, you are unusually thin, that is not what all women are,"" she says. Brown still beautifies the faces of models in all her advertising campaigns, but her business interests are not limited to cosmetics. She has partnered with Safilo, a leading Italian eyewear brand, to design a range of glasses, and has recently been appointed as Editor-in-Chief of Yahoo's new beauty section.

""I'm trying to create a space that is empowering, that's teaching, that's fun, with a sense of humor, that's visually exciting and cool,"" she says, ""but mostly, a place that will give women real answers to not just beauty but lifestyle and empowerment, and everything it means to be a successful, happy woman. And I hope a man, too, I have things planned for men as well,"" Brown adds. The entrepreneur has also channeled her energy into philanthropy, starting the Pretty Powerful Campaign for Women and Girls, where 100% of the purchase price of a limited edition product goes to programs helping disadvantaged women and girls around the world. The company also sponsors Dress for Success, a global charity which offers unemployed women career advice and professional attire for job interviews. Brown's youthful face and eyes exude humor, and she fosters a homey atmosphere in her headquarters in New York's trendy SoHo. Large windows flood the pastel-colored space with sunlight, and there are regular yoga sessions. ""There are dogs and kids that come in, and I love having this atmosphere, it's who I am,"" she says. The make-up mogul jokingly describes herself as a Type A personality -- hardworking and efficient, yet able to unplug from the daily grind: ""I enjoy things that are not about my work, I enjoy my husband, my kids and nephews, my 'entourage,' as I call them. And whether it's family vacations or trips, I'm able to let go,"" she says. However, the 57-year-old is not ready to hang up her brushes any time soon. ""I'm bad at golf and even worse at tennis,"" she quips, adding that she doesn't feel she has reached her pinnacle yet. ""So many things happened in my career which were important moments, from my first Vogue cover to getting into Bergdorf Goodman and Harrods, and finally when Leonard Lauder called, but then things just continued to happen. ""So, I haven't made it yet,"" she concludes. Read more: Marina Abramovic, the sorceress who creates art out of thin air .

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- U.S. drone strikes in Yemen on Friday killed six militants, including two senior leaders of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, four local security sources said. Qaed al-Thahab, the top AQAP leader in the country's Baitha province and described as a ""high-profile target,"" was among those killed, the sources said. They said eight missiles were launched by two unmanned drone planes targeting vehicles. The strikes are believed to have been undertaken by the United States, which has been conducting drone strikes in the fight against terrorism. There was no immediate comment about the attack from the United States. Offensives by the nation's army and drone attacks by the United States have reduced the terror organization's effectiveness in recent years. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is the al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen. The Long War Journal, a website that tracks, reports and analyzes the U.S. fight against terrorists, said the drone strike was the first in Yemen since August 10, when the United States targeted AQAP operatives traveling in Lahj province. Drone strikes against militants in Yemen intensified a few weeks ago as the U.S. Embassy there and in other Middle Eastern and African countries closed amid terrorism fears. After the Lahj strike, a Yemeni Defense Ministry official said that 34 people had been killed in 12 drone strikes since July 28.","Two of the six militants were senior leaders for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula .

"Washington (CNN) -- Letting openly gay or lesbian troops serve in the military would have little lasting impact on the U.S. armed forces, a major Pentagon review has found, several sources familiar with the results told CNN Tuesday. Putting an end to ""don't ask, don't tell"" would have ""some limited and isolated disruption to unit cohesion and retention,"" the year-long study found, but the effects would not be long-lasting or widespread. There will be some strong minority opposition, particularly in the Marines and some combat arms specialist units, said the chairs of the study, Defense Department General Counsel Jeh C. Johnson and Army Gen. Carter F. Ham. As many as 40 to 60 percent of troops in those units were against changing the 17-year-old policy that lets gay and lesbian troops serve as long as their sexual orientation is secret. Overall opposition throughout the military was about 30 percent -- roughly the same as it is in America as a whole, according to recent findings from CNN/Opinion Research Corp. and the Pew Forum. Top administration and military officials are briefing the Senate on Tuesday on the results of the Pentagon review. Johnson told members of Congress on Tuesday that he thought ""don't ask, don't tell"" could be repealed even while the United States is at war, sources said. The Pentagon believes that the study is ""the largest, most comprehensive review of a personnel policy matter which the Department of Defense has ever undertaken,"" a defense official close to the process said. More than nine out of 10 troops said their unit's ability to work with someone they thought was gay or lesbian was very good, good, or neither good nor bad. The authors of the report say gay and lesbian troops would continue to be discreet about their personal lives, even with a repeal, based on observations of workplaces in civilian society. The authors said they did hear a large number of religious and morally based objections to homosexuality. Troops would not be asked to change their beliefs, and their the views should not be downplayed, the authors said in their remarks to Congress, even as they pointed out that troops already work and fight alongside people with other faiths and beliefs. The authors outlined a number of recommendations for effectively handling the repeal, including leaders making clear what is expected of troops in the field. Although the report will say it is not necessary to change standards of conduct extensively, some new guidance on conduct will be necessary. The authors will also recommend that those previously removed from the military under ""don't ask, don't tell"" be allowed to reapply under the same criteria as anyone else seeking to rejoin the military. Even with a repeal, not all benefits will be available to gay service members and their partners because of the Defense of Marriage Act. The recommendations are based on surveys, focus groups and face-to-face meetings at bases around the world and even a carefully controlled effort to communicate anonymously with homosexuals serving in the military. The Pentagon sent surveys to 400,000 troops and got about 115,000 responses. It sent separate questionnaires to 150,000 military spouses and got 44,000 back. The Defense Department also set up a website for service members who wanted to comment. That effort elicited 72,000 responses. And the Pentagon held meetings at 51 U.S. military bases around the world where 24,000 more troops discussed the issue. Officials preparing the report also went to the service academies to hear from staff, faculty and students. Key senators fired the warning shots for what could be a bitter debate in the chamber as the week began. ""The system is working,"" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. ""The military is at its highest point in recruitment, in retention, in professionalism, in capability. So to somehow allege that this policy has been damaging the military is simply false."" Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, shot back on ""Fox News Sunday,"" saying that ""gay members of the military have served for decades, and there hasn't been a problem with our military being the finest in the world. ... We should move forward to make sure that any person who stands up and says, 'I'm willing to die for our country' can do so with honor."" On Thursday, the committee will hear from Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. On Friday, it will hear from the top brass of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines. McCain, the ranking Republican on the committee, will undoubtedly ask why a survey of active duty military and families -- a central part of the report -- did not directly ask whether they supported changing the present policy but focused instead on how it should be changed. The former presidential contender wrote a letter to Gates about this in September. In a response in October, Gates told McCain that it was not part of the charter of the Pentagon's so-called working group to poll the troops on whether the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy should be repealed. ""I do not believe that military policy decisions should -- on this or any other subject -- be subject to referendum of service members,"" Gates wrote. His letter to McCain has not been released, but a Pentagon source confirmed the accuracy of the quote. Gates said the survey will allow him, Mullen and the chiefs of the individual services to understand how a policy change may affect ""unit cohesion, military readiness and effectiveness, recruiting and retention and family readiness."" Outside the military, Americans are overwhelmingly in favor of repealing the Clinton-era law. A Pew survey released Monday indicated that a majority of Americans say they favor allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the armed forces. According to the poll, 58 percent of the public approves of allowing homosexuals to serve openly, with 27 percent saying they are opposed. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll conducted earlier in November indicated that more than seven in 10 Americans said that people who are openly gay or lesbian should be allowed to serve in the military, with 23 percent opposed. Despite public opinion on the side of repeal supporters, the heads of the four military branches have either directly opposed or been unenthusiastic about the policy change, at least until the Pentagon report was finished and released. Marine Commandant James Amos has said that he opposes the change while the U.S. is fighting in Afghanistan because of its potential negative effect on unit cohesion. He will be joined on the second day of hearings by another Marine, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Marine Corps Gen. James Cartwright. Gen. George Casey, the Army chief of staff, has said he is on board with Gates in considering the effect of the repeal. But committee members may remind him of something he told them earlier. ""I do have serious concerns about the impact of the repeal of the law on a force that's fully engaged in two wars and has been at war for eight and a half years,"" Casey said this year. Once the hearings are over, the spotlight will turn to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. He will decide how the issue will move forward, whether to keep it part of the Defense Authorization Bill or whether to strip it off for a separate vote. But the calendar could be the biggest factor weighing on whether the law is repealed or upheld. With just weeks left for this Congress with its significant Democratic majority, the leadership will need to decide whether it has the time, amid other priorities it wants considered, to mire the Senate in debate about ""don't ask, don't tell.""

"(CNN) -- When the patrons of the Stonewall Inn fought back after the New York police raided that Greenwich Village gay bar 44 years ago, no one there imagined the federal government would ever recognize the rights of two women or two men to get married. No other movement for equality in the United States has ever traveled so far or so quickly as the push for equality for gay men and women. I have a vivid memory of a dinner at Gracie Mansion with Tom Stoddard, an early leader of the gay rights movement, and Ed Koch, then the mayor of New York, sometime in the late '80s, when the idea of same-sex marriage was first in the air. ""If you think people are going to go for this, you're crazy!"" Koch said. I'm sure I agreed with Koch at the time. As a gay man who came out the year after the Stonewall riots, I have witnessed more change than I had ever imagined would be possible in my own lifetime. When I was a reporter for The New York Times in the 1970s, like every other gay employee there, I was securely in the closet. No gay person there believed his or her career could survive a disclosure about sexual orientation. Opinion: Fight for gay rights must continue . In fact, in 1980, there was exactly one openly gay reporter at a daily paper in New York City: Joe Nicholson of the New York Post. By 1996, more than 300 of Nicholson's colleagues at other mainstream media outlets had followed his example. That gives a small idea of how far and how quickly we have come. With Wednesday's two decisions from the Supreme Court, one ordering the federal government to recognize same-sex marriages wherever they occur, the other reinstating marriage equality in California by letting a lower court ruling stand, the court's five-member majority has placed itself firmly on the right side of history. This is the third historic gay rights decision written by Justice Anthony Kennedy. The first one was Romer v. Evans, in 1996, when the court threw out a Colorado state constitutional amendment that had forbidden protection for gay people from discrimination. The second one was Lawrence v. Texas, decided 10 years ago on Wednesday, which outlawed every state statute that had criminalized same-sex love-making. The harbingers for Wednesday's decision were clearly in place in Kennedy's Colorado opinion. In 1996, he wrote, ""A state cannot ... deem a class of persons a stranger to its laws."" The Colorado provision had singled out gay people as ""a solitary class,"" creating a legal disability so sweeping, it could only be explained ""by animus."" On Wednesday, Kennedy wrote that the Defense of Marriage Act ""writes inequality into the entire United States code.""... (Its]) principal effect is to identify a subset of state-sanctioned marriages and make them unequal."" The court called DOMA an ""unusual deviation from the tradition of recognizing and accepting the benefits and responsibilities that come with federal recognition of their marriages. This is strong evidence of a law having the purpose and effect of disapproval of a class recognized and protected by state law. DOMA's avowed purpose and practical effect are to impose a disadvantage, a separate status, and so a stigma upon all who enter into same-sex marriages made lawful by the unquestioned authority of the states."" Among other things, Wednesday's decision is a reminder of just how important the political process is to progress in America. The first person nominated by Ronald Reagan to fill what is now Kennedy's seat was Robert Bork. Bork was a fierce opponent of equal rights for gay people, and if the Democrats in the United States Senate had not blocked his nomination, opening the way to Kennedy's appointment, none of these historic decisions might have been possible. Opinion: How youth led change in public attitudes . Wednesday's decisions also would likely not have happened without the election of Barack Obama in 2008. As Andrew Tobias, treasurer of the Democratic National Committee, said Wednesday, John McCain repeatedly promised to appoint justices like John Roberts and Antonin Scalia, both of whom were in the minority on DOMA. ""So the vote would have been 6 to 3 against, instead of 5 to 4 in favor,"" Tobias said, without the votes of Obama appointees Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. James Esseks,director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender & AIDS Project, said, ""One of the things that's really important about the DOMA decision is that it gets rid of the core of the last federal law that requires discrimination against gay people. The country used to have a lot of laws that required discrimination against gay people,"" including an executive order signed by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1953 that banned gay employees in the federal government and all its contractors (an order that remained in effect until it was vacated in 1975). ""Until 1991, federal immigration law actually barred gay people from entering the country,"" Esseks recalled. We still have a long way to go. While the Proposition 8 ruling makes California the 13th state to allow same-sex marriage, there are still 37 that do not. For more than 30 years, Congress has refused to pass a law that would make it illegal to fire someone because of his or her sexual orientation, and there is no chance that will change as long as Republicans control the House. Bullying of gay children and gay teenagers also remains routine at elementary schools and high schools throughout the land. There is something bittersweet about a decision that expands the equality of gay people the day after the same court, including Kennedy, issued a horrendous decision gutting the Voting Rights Act, perhaps the most important civil rights achievement of our time. This is especially true because the black civil rights movement provided all the blueprints that made the gay movement possible. Opinion: The only history that counts for me is my own . But Wednesday is still a day for great celebration. On Wednesday my country continued its journey toward fundamental fairness for people like me faster than any member of my generation ever thought it could. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charles Kaiser.","Charles Kaiser: At Stonewall riot 44 years ago, no one would have imagined today's ruling .
He says the push for equality for gay men and women has made incredibly fast, recent progress .
He says much of it due to political process; boons of Kennedy appointment, Obama election .

"(CNN) -- They have two wheels, can weigh less than a kilo and more than 6 million of them are made each year. They're Giant Bicylces -- the work of a Taiwan based company which has been making bikes since 1972, and now has over 12,000 retail partners worldwide. The secret to its success? The process is everything. Tony Lo, CEO of Giant Global Group, is an avid cyclist himself and commutes 35 kilometers on his Giant Propel Advanced SL, which he describes as the most aerodynamic road bike in the world. ""Whenever I get on a bicycle I always feel very free,"" he says. ""The bike is an arrow, cutting through the wind. Everything disappears except you and the road in front of you."" Giant's bikes are made from millions of carbon fibers, each thinner than a human hair, cut by machines and sewn together. ""You want it very light, you want it very strong. But you also want the strength or stiffness only at where you want it,"" he says. ""Metal you can shape, but when you make the carbon fiber you can decide where each piece goes. You want the pedal to be very strong -- we call that the power core -- but in the seat you want it to be a bit soft, so it doesn't feel so hard,"" says Lo. The bonded carbon fibers are cut into sheets that become the bike frames, and just like fresh bread, the frames are then baked in an oven before being rigorously tested. ""The most important thing we learn is that the bicycle can always become better,"" adds Lo. Watch the video above to learn how to build a Giant bike. Are 'immortal' jellyfish key to eternal life?

"(CNN) -- Attorneys for a Guantanamo Bay detainee on a hunger strike say a U.S. military nurse has refused to conduct forced feedings of inmates. Abu Wa'el Dhiab has been at the U.S. Navy base on Cuba since August 2002, attorney Cori Crider told CNN. Crider says Dhiab told her in a telephone call last week about the reported actions of the unnamed male nurse, believed to be a Navy medical officer. ""Initially, he did carry out his orders and participate in the tube feedings. But when he came, as soon as he saw what was happening, he started talking to the brothers,"" meaning the inmates, Dhiab was quoted as saying. ""He explained to us: 'Before we came here, we were told a different story. The story we were told was completely the opposite of what I saw.' Once he saw with his own eyes that what he was told was contrary to what was actually taking place here, he decided he could not do it anymore."" A Pentagon official late Tuesday confirmed, ""There was a recent instance of a medical provider not willing to carry-out the enteral feeding of a detainee. The matter is in the hands of the individual's leadership. The service member has been temporarily assigned to alternate duties with no impact to medical support operations."" There are 147 personnel attached to the Joint Medical Group, of which 83 are responsible for direct detainee care. Details of the nurse's refusal were first reported by The Miami Herald. The military refers to the controversial process as ""enteral feeding,"" which is designed to provide liquid nutrition and medicine via a tube inserted in the nose directly into the stomach. CNN was recently given a tour of the hospital at Guantanamo, where the forced feeding procedures were demonstrated without the involvement of any inmate. Dhiab is part of a group of detainees who are participating in a hunger strike to protest their continued, open-end detention without charges being filed, said Crider, who works at the London-based legal defense group Reprieve. Crider said it was believed to be the first time one of the U.S. medical personnel has refused to carry out the feeding regimen. ""This nurse showed incredible courage -- to see the basic humanity of the prisoners and to recognize that force-feeding is wrong is a historic stand,"" Crider told CNN. ""It meant a great deal to my client and to the other cleared detainees who are hunger striking."" Through his legal team, Dhiab has filed a federal lawsuit, protesting the forced-feeding policy. The U.S. military has justified it as humane and necessary to keep the inmate alive. There are about 150 inmates currently at Guantanamo. Supporters of Dhiab say he is among more than 40 men who at one time in the past few years were being forced fed. In their June 2013 lawsuit, Dhiab and three other men urged the court to intervene quickly. ""Petitioners request an expeditious hearing on this application because of the extreme nature of the human rights and medical ethics violations that result from petitioners' force-feeding,"" said the lawsuit, ""and because of the imminent risk that it will deprive them of the ability to observe the Ramadan fast,"" which typically happens in July. ""Petitioners do not trust the Guantanamo doctors and nurses, because those staff have been ordered by their superior officers to subject petitioners to a force-feeding regimen they reject and which causes them humiliation and pain."" Dhiab, 43, was captured in 2002 in Pakistan. His supporters deny he is a terrorist and say the Syrian had been operating a food import business in Kabul, Afghanistan before the 9/11 terror attacks. He has been cleared for release since 2009, but U.S. officials said they were reluctant to send him back to Syria because of that country's ongoing civil war. His supporters say he could be sent to Uruguay, but there is no indication when any transfer would happen. A federal judge in May allowed Dhiab to be forced-fed to keep him alive, but strongly urged authorities to use other methods, criticizing the Pentagon's continued ""refusal to compromise."" ""The court is in no position to make the complex medical decisions necessary to keep Mr. Dhiab alive,"" said Judge Gladys Kessler. ""Mr. Dhiab may well suffer unnecessary pain from certain enteral feeding practices and forcible cell extractions. However, the court simply cannot let Mr. Dhiab die."" Kessler also ordered the Obama administration to release 34 video recordings of Dhiab being forced-fed, as well as the detainee's medical records. The legal case is Belbacha v. Obama (04-2215).

"(CNN) -- A top U.S. Justice Department official warned Alabama's education department that the state's controversial immigration law has had ""lasting"" and possibly illegal consequences for Hispanic school children, according to a letter released Thursday. ""(The law has) diminished access to and quality of education for many of Alabama's Hispanic children, resulted in missed school days, chilled or prevented the participation of parents in their children's education, and transformed the climates of some schools into less safe and welcoming spaces for Hispanic children,"" wrote Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez, head of the federal department's Civil Rights Division. The legislation, known as HB 56, has several provisions, including one requiring police who make lawful traffic stops or arrests to try to determine the immigration status of anyone they suspect might be in the country illegally. A federal appeals court has blocked some components, however, including one requiring Alabama officials to check the immigration status of children in public schools. Even with such changes mandated by the courts and others proposed by legislators, Perez argues in a letter to state Superintendent of Education Thomas Bice that the bill already has had negative effects. He points to data provided by Alabama officials that, he says, shows that ""Hispanic students absence rates tripled while absence rates for other groups of students remained virtually flat."" That includes a sharp drop in those getting schooling through English as a second language programs, meaning they did not ""receive the educational services to which they are legally entitled."" Perez also writes that ""the rate of total withdrawals of Hispanic children substantially increased,"" with 13.4% of such children having dropped out between the beginning of the current school year and this February."" There was no immediate comment Thursday night from the state about Perez's letter. Three weeks ago, state Department of Education spokeswoman Malissa Valdes said that when the law went into effect last September, there were about 1,200 daily absences more than normal of Hispanic students. This compares to a normal absentee rate of about 900 to 1,000 students. In mid-March, that number was 1,478 absences among Hispanics and the number fell to 1,340 in April, said Valdes. Notably, the Alabama law as written allows students to be questioned on their immigration status, though this information was not intended to deny them enrollment in public schools. One of the bill's authors, state Sen. Scott Beason, defended the idea of checking students' legal status. ""I think it's important that we gather that data,"" said Beason, a Republican like most of the members of the state's legislature. ""I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with collecting the data, and I think the courts will agree."" Nearly 99% of all Alabama K-12 public school students are U.S. citizens, said Perez. And many of those of Hispanic origin feel ""unwelcome in schools they had attended for years,"" he added, basing these comments on interviews with students, parents, teachers and administrators. Many reported ""being singled out to receive notices or attend assemblies about HB 56,"" as well as ""increased anxiety and diminished concentration in school, deteriorating grades and increased hostility, bullying and intimidation,"" said the civil rights division chief. Perez noted the U.S. Department of Justice's duty to enforce laws that bar ""discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin,"" and requirements that ""affirmative measures"" be taken to assist students for whom English isn't their native language. ""Further, the United States Supreme Court held (in a 1982 case) that a state may not deny a child equal access to public education based on his or her immigration status,"" he said. Several supporters of the law, including Gov. Robert Bentley, have suggested changes to the law -- considered one of the toughest in the country, along with Arizona's landmark legislation -- but have been adamant that the core of it remain in tact. Todd Stacy, a spokesman to House Speaker Mike Hubbard, said late last year that such discussions dealt with improving the law, ""clearing up misconceptions and correcting any portions that might be vague or require additional definitions."" ""Make no mistake, the legislature is not going to repeal this law and have Alabama become a sanctuary state for illegal immigrants,"" Stacy said. CNN's Gustavo Valdes contributed to this report.","Justice Department's civil rights chief sends letter to Alabama's superintendent .

"Washington (CNN) -- In what may be the furthest thing from a pleasure cruise, the U.S. Coast Guard's only operating Arctic icebreaker is escorting a Russian-flagged tanker this week on an emergency fuel run to the ice-blocked town of Nome, Alaska. The mission: Deliver 1.1 million gallons of diesel fuel and 300,000 gallons of gasoline to Nome (population 3,598), where storms prevented a fuel shipment in the fall. Midweek, the two ships left Dutch Harbor, in Alaska's Aleutian Islands. Friday, the ships are expected to encounter the ice, and USCG Cutter Healy will take the lead, plowing a 300-mile-long path for the Russian-flagged tanker Renda. If all goes well, the two ships will arrive at Nome on Sunday or Monday. The Healy will stop a half mile short of the harbor to avoid scraping the bottom, while the tanker Renda will push on, stopping next to stable ice to off-load fuel using a lengthy hoses. Officials are calling the trip historic. It is the first time fuel has been delivered through ice-covered waters to a western Alaska community, they say. While it is possible to exaggerate Nome's plight -- fuel could have been flown in -- officials say it is difficult to exaggerate what this mission says about the dismal status of the Coast Guard's ice-breaking fleet. The nation's two heavy polar icebreakers -- the Polar Star and the Polar Sea -- are out of commission, with the Polar Sea unlikely to see service again. The 420-foot Healy, meanwhile, is a medium-sized icebreaker and it does not have the capabilities of its larger predecessors. The Nome mission has lengthened the eight-month deployment of its 80-person crew, robbing them of a Christmas holiday. And it is delaying scheduled repairs to the ship, possibly affecting its scientific mission scheduled for next summer. This further underscores just how thin the nation's ice-breaking capabilities have become. By contrast, Russia has 25 polar icebreakers (including eight heavy ones), according to a Congressional Research Service report. Finland and Sweden have seven icebreakers each. Canada has six. ""The United States needs icebreakers, and this incident proves it,"" said Alaska's Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell. Treadwell said the dearth of icebreakers means the U.S. is not competitive with other Arctic nations, which are exploiting new water passages created by climate changes. Icebreakers could extend the seasons for some state industries, he said. But many people in the Lower 48 just don't understand, Treadwell said. ""The United States has been an Arctic nation since 1867, but most people still think of Alaska as Seward's Folly,"" he said. The Nome mission ""brings awareness that there is a bigger issue there,"" said Nome Mayor Denise Michels. ""It really does."" ""There is more of a need now than ever before in our history for new ice-breaking ships capable of reaching the shores of our communities,"" wrote Jason Evans, chairman of Sitnasuak Native Corporation, Nome's village corporation. Slow-motion crisis . If the Nome situation is a crisis, it's a ""crisis that's kind of unfolding in slow motion,"" Evans told CNN. The stage was set in November when a major storm swept through the region, delaying a barge carrying 1.6 million gallons of fuel to Nome. After the storm cleared, sea ice blocked the harbor. The village corporation, one of two main suppliers of fuel for the town, quickly determined its existing fuel would likely run out before another barge could reach the town in the spring. There was a chance that home heating fuel would run out by March, when Nome is still subject to freezing temperatures. Diesel fuel for the police department and heavy equipment ran out a week ago, though the town's other supplier has helped fill that void. And gasoline is expected to run out in early February, Evans said. Corporation officials considered flying in fuel. But it would have taken more than 300 flights, each carrying 4,000 to 5,000 gallons, to meet the town's needs, Evans said. Shipping costs would have added $3 or $4 to the price of a gallon of gasoline, which already approaches $6 a gallon, he said. The corporation considered hiring local ice-breaking tugs, Canadian tugs and barges, Norwegian ice-breaking ships and Russian ships, finally settling on Russian ships that were ""close, capable and possibly available."" Vitus Marine LLC contracted with the Renda, a Russian-flagged, double-hulled vessel. Since the Renda is an ice-breaking tanker, ""we were confident, cautiously confident, that they could do it unassisted,"" Evans said. But Evans said he sought assistance from the Coast Guard icebreaker to ensure the mission's success. ""This has never been done before and when you do something that's never been done before, having an organization like the U.S. Coast Guard is a huge relief,"" Evans said. Officials said legal and regulatory obstacles were as formidable as the ice. Evans and officials worked with the Coast Guard to get a waiver from the Jones Act, which requires goods being transported from one U.S. port to another to be transported by a U.S.-flagged ship. The Coast Guard inspected the Renda so it could operate in U.S. waters. And they worked out a plan to off-load the fuel at Nome. State officials invoked a law signed by President Franklin Roosevelt that allows the Coast Guard to conduct operations for commercial enterprises. Though commonly used to justify Coast Guard operations in the Great Lakes and Hudson River, it had not previously been used to assist businesses in Alaska, officials said. ""The same protections that Americans enjoy in the Great Lakes, western Alaskans ought to enjoy,"" Treadwell said. To the rescue . Rear Adm. Thomas Ostebo, commander of the Coast Guard's district that includes Alaska, said the Coast Guard had wanted to be part of the operation from the beginning. ""Clearly having Healy there in the event that something were to (go wrong), just a simple mechanical problem on Renda, the Healy's there to help her out,"" Ostebo said. ""It's a 300-mile transit in ice close to our shores and the prudent thing to do."" Ostebo said the Cutter Healy can cut through ""first year"" ice at close to 10 knots, but that the speed of the Renda may be the limiting factor. He said he is confident that mission will be successful. ""We're not relying on hope or chance here. We've spent a lot of time with all of our partners, whether that's state, federal, tribal partners, as well as the city of Nome, to ensure that we look at all of the details of how this operation is going to go down,"" he said. ""I think we're going to do fine on this."" Village corporation chairman Evans agreed. ""I've done everything but celebrate yet,"" he said.","Coast Guard's only Arctic icebreaker is escorting fuel ship to Nome .

"Paris (CNN) -- Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former International Monetary Fund chief who was at one time accused of sexually assaulting a hotel maid in New York, is threatening to sue a Belgian sex club using the initials ""D.S.K."" The Dodo Sex Klub is due to open Wednesday in Blaton, a town on the Belgian-French border. Strauss-Kahn is often referred to as ""DSK,"" especially by the French media. The former head of the IMF ""will take all legal measures necessary to cease the smearing of his name,"" according to a statement released by five French and Belgian lawyers. Strauss-Kahn's attorney had no further comment when contacted by CNN. The club's owner, Dominique Alderweireld, owns a string of prostitution houses in Belgium. And he's no stranger to Strauss-Kahn. Later this year, Alderweireld will be on trial, along with Strauss-Kahn, on charges of ""aggravated pimping"" for their alleged participation in a prostitution ring at the Hotel Carlton in Lille, in northern France. In 2011, a maid at New York's Sofitel Hotel accused Strauss-Kahn of trying to force himself on her when she came to clean his room. He was indicted on seven counts, including sexual assault and attempted rape, but all the charges were dropped after prosecutors found inconsistencies in the woman's story. The woman later filed a civil lawsuit against Strauss-Kahn. The two reached a settlement in 2012, but the terms were not disclosed.","Strauss-Kahn was accused of sexually assaulting a hotel maid in New York in 2011 .

"London, England (CNN) -- The British parliament was officially dissolved on Monday, as a nationwide election campaign launches to determine if Gordon Brown can hang on as prime minister. The opposition Conservative party, led by David Cameron, has consistently held an edge in recent opinion polls, but it is not clear that Cameron has a big enough lead to dislodge Brown. Elections take place on May 6. Brown's Labour party has been in power for 13 years, first under Tony Blair and, since 2007, with Brown as prime minister. Brown is hoping to lead Labour to an unprecedented fourth consecutive term in office. Under the British parliamentary system, voters choose a member of parliament from each of 650 constituencies, or districts. The party with the most seats traditionally gets the first chance to form the new government. Queen Elizabeth II, as head of state, formally dissolved parliament on Monday, a procedural step. The announcement means there are officially no members of Parliament as of 5 p.m. London time Monday (12 noon ET.) ""MPs immediately revert to being members of the general public and lose all the privileges associated with being a Member of Parliament,"" Parliament's Web site says. ""They are allowed access to Parliament for just a few days to remove papers and equipment from their offices. But all MPs' services and facilities are closed at 5 p.m. on the day of dissolution,"" the site says. ""Government ministers remain in charge of their departments until after the election result is known,"" according to Parliament, but do not make any major policy decisions.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As a candidate, Barack Obama promoted hybrid cars. Auto enthusiasts have panned the design of the new presidential limo, which will be painted all black. As president, he'll be handed the keys to one. Sort of. Shortly after taking the oath of office, Obama will climb into the Mother of All Hybrids -- part car, part truck and, from the looks of it, part tank. In keeping with recent tradition, the Secret Service will place a brand-new presidential limousine into service January 20 to drive the new president on the 2-mile jaunt down Pennsylvania Avenue during the inaugural parade. Already, spy photos of the limo -- with patches of gray primer -- have leaked out. And already, the reviews: . ""Ugly as sin,"" says one car enthusiast on an auto Web site. ""Can't we make a hotter ride for our pres?"" ""Sheesh,"" says another, ""why don't they just transport the president around in an Abrams tank."" One news agency, noting its 8-inch-thick doors, says the limo can withstand a ""direct hit from an asteroid."" But GM spokeswoman Joanne K. Krell laughed off the comments. ""And it will fix you a latte if you ask,"" she jokes.  Watch Obama's new wheels » . In truth, the new presidential limo is a Cadillac, Krell said, although it is ""not a direct extension of any single model."" ""The presidential vehicle is built to precise and special specifications, undergoes extreme testing and development, and also incorporates many of the top aspects of Cadillac's 'regular' cars -- such as signature design, hand-cut-and-sewn interiors, etc.,"" Krell told CNN. ""Cadillac is honored to serve and renew this great tradition,"" she said. ""And it is entirely appropriate that an American president has at his service a great American vehicle."" For much of the country's history, the Secret Service didn't even drive the president, evidently oblivious to the dangers of asteroids. In the post-Lincoln horse-and-buggy era, it was customary for a security detail to closely trail the president, according to a Secret Service history. With the advent of automobiles, the Secret Service acquired a 1907 H. White Steamer to follow Theodore Roosevelt's horse-drawn carriage. White House chauffeurs drove later presidents, until the Secret Service assumed many of the driving responsibilities after Franklin Roosevelt's death in 1945. In 1965, Lyndon Johnson was the first president to ride in a bulletproof limo in an inaugural parade, less than two years after his predecessor, John F. Kennedy, was shot and killed while riding in an open car.  Take a look at a few presidential limos » . Cut off from the world . Obama should expect two seemingly contradictory feelings when riding in the presidential limousine, said Joe Funk, a retired Secret Service agent who was President Bill Clinton's driver during part of his career.  Watch Funk talk about his time as the president's driver » . ""I think he will be surprised about how when he's in the limo, it's a cocoon,"" Funk said. ""The everyday noises will be gone, and he will be totally isolated in this protective envelope."" ""At the same time, I think he will be surprised at the communication capabilities, how the phones, the satellites, the Internet -- everything is at his fingertips,"" he said. ""So at one end, you are totally removed from society. The other side of the coin is that he can have any communications worldwide at a moment's touch."" Funk says presidents sometimes chat with the agents, and sometimes don't. ""Every day is different, just like every person,"" he said. ""Sometimes they get in the car and they have a lot on their mind. They're involved in reading material, they're involved in the newspaper, they're talking to local dignitaries or they are talking to Cabinet-level. ""Other times, they are interested in sporting events, in doing the crossword puzzle, interested in the feedback they get from talking to the agents -- primarily the supervisor that sits in the front seat,"" Funk said. While the government spares no expense for the presidential limo, the weight of the car makes it less maneuverable and more sluggish than comparable sport utility vehicles, Funk said. And the door and window frames, which accommodate thick ballistic glass, create large blind spots, he said. Funk's own experience driving Clinton was uneventful, he says, which is a good thing, considering his line of business. ""I was very lucky. We didn't have any close calls,"" he says. ""Everything was very smooth."" But he still considers the experience a career highlight. ""At the end of the day, if you had a good driving day, you do kind of sit back with a certain amount of pride and say, 'I had the president of the United States in the car with me for an hour, two hours, and I got him from point A to point B safely in conjunction with all the other team members,' "" he said. ""When it's done, you can sit back and take some pride in knowing that you pulled it off."" Available in any color, as long as it's black . One Internet wag, adding to the rampant speculation about the new car, made this prediction: It will be painted black. But environmentalists may ask, will it be green? Not likely. Car enthusiasts believe the overweight vehicle burns diesel and will have low mileage. And with diesel costing about $2.40 a gallon Monday, versus $1.67 for gasoline, this new limo can't be called an economy vehicle. ""The limousines of yesteryear were designed just well enough to provide protection to get the president out of the situation,"" says Ken Lucci, CEO of Ambassador Limousine Inc. and owner of two Reagan-era limos. ""In today's case, they [the Secret Service] expect a prolonged attack, and they expect an attack that is a lot more violent than [with] a weapon you can hold in you hand."" ""It literally is a rolling bunker,"" he says. ""It just happens to have wheels on it."" And it's not a bad vehicle for someone whose job is to fix the economy, even if it won't brew coffee on command.","New presidential limo will transport Obama on Inauguration Day .

"Moscow (CNN) -- An American businessman who lost his company, health and freedom in Russia is now struggling to merely stay alive. Arkadi Gontmakher is the owner of the company that used to be the largest U.S. crab importer from Russia. Two weeks ago, he was unanimously acquitted by a 12-member jury in a high-profile court case in Russia's remote Kamchatka region. But earlier this week, he was charged with an almost identical set of criminal violations, according to his family and lawyers. ""Gontmakher is suspected of (laundering the profits from selling) crab products in 2006-2007 fished in Russia's exclusive economic zone, without having proper permission,"" said senior investigator Galina Saigushkina, who is leading the new probe. Speaking to CNN from the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, eight times zones east of Moscow, she said Gontmakher is now in a hospital under orders not to leave. According to Russian law, if convicted, he could be jailed for up to 10 years, in addition to the more than 39 months he already spent in prison since his 2007 arrest. But because of his deteriorating health, he may not even be able to go through another trial. Gontmakher's certified medical records, which were obtained by CNN, show he has a number of cardiac disorders, including serious atrial fibrillation. He is, in the words of his wife, ""at death's door."" ""I have a congenital heart illness that was exacerbated during my years in prison. I badly need heart surgery but they don't do the kind of operations that I need in Russia, let alone here,"" Gontmakher said in a phone interview from a cardiology clinic in Kamchatka, where he is under police surveillance. ""My heart rate routinely reaches 170-180 beats per minute. I've had illness bouts almost every day in the past few weeks that lasted anywhere from eight to 14 hours. On top of that, I have chronic kidney problems. ""Seems like they'll keep coming up with more charges until I finally die,"" he said. Gontmakher and his legal team have continuously appealed to Russian authorities about his severe heart condition that needs immediate treatment. But Saigushkina said no such appeals were ""presented to the investigation -- neither by Gontmakher not by his defense lawyers."" The Ukrainian-born Gontmakher, now 53, is the founder of the Washington-based crab importing company Global Fishing Inc. Nicknamed in the U.S. media the ""King Crab King,"" he was arrested in Moscow in September of 2007 and charged with leading an international criminal group which was conducting massive crab overfishing off Russia's continental shelf and laundering its illicit proceeds, according to the Russian Interior Ministry. The investigation report asserted that in the first half of 2007, he and his partners illegally caught 9 million kilograms (9,000 tons) of prime king crab worth about $58 million. The court trial lasted from May to mid-December of 2010 and was interrupted several times due to Gontmakher's heart ailments. But eventually the jury reached a not guilty verdict on all counts for the crab king, as well as for two of his Russian business associates who stood in the dock with him. Moreover, jurors ruled that the events of the crimes didn't occur in the first place, according to Gontmakher's lawyer. But as the two Russians were set free, police rearrested Gontmakher in the courtroom just minutes after his acquittal, with a notice that he was suspected in another criminal case going back to 2006, and needed to be interrogated without delay, his lawyer said. The stress caused by this news catapulted Gontmakher back to the hospital's intensive therapy ward. ""I had been purchasing my crab in Kamchatka from a whole range of Russian fishing companies, to keep two of my processing factories, in the U.S. and in China, busy,"" he explained. ""I was buying all my crab from a seafood warehouse in South Korea -- after the Russians caught it, pre-processed it and delivered it there, with proper customs declarations, acceptance certificates and other papers proving the origin and legality of the produce. I didn't have any crab-fishing ships, I was only a wholesale buyer,"" Gontmakher said. ""And with all of my Russian sellers I had always applied exactly the same business model as in the case that I had been charged for but found innocent of."" ""In this case I'm being held responsible for doing the same kind of business but with another Russian partner,"" he said. ""As far as his new case is concerned, those are different charges, other than those he had been acquitted of in court,"" investigator Saigushkina said, refusing to elaborate any further. Ever since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the following economic chaos in Russia, seafood harvesting, and especially crab fishing, has been a highly-lucrative but shadowy business in the country's resource-rich Pacific coast. Rampant poaching and overfishing in the region in the 1990s has brought the highly-priced Kamchatka king crab to the brink of extinction. In the past few years, the government managed to impose a firmer grip on the industry, and introduced heavy restrictions on crab fishing. Nevertheless, poaching and exceeding legal harvesting limits are still common, according to authorities. Gontmakher's Russian lawyer, Vladimir Odyagaylo, said that knowing how things work in Russia, he believes his client could have been set up by unscrupulous competitors who wanted to sideline the successful American. However, Odyagaylo said he didn't have any hard evidence of that. Responding to a question about corruption in the Russian crab-fishing business, he said, ""Up until 2002, when the harvesting quotas were single-handedly distributed at the whim of the local governor, it was a very criminalized industry. But after 2002, quotas were auctioned, and anyone could openly buy them."" He added that his client had no links to crab poachers whatsoever. Global Fishing, Inc., was founded by Gontmakher in 1999 in Washington state. It was the largest American importer and supplier of Russian crab and other seafood products to the United States and internationally. A once growing multi-million dollar business, it shut down operations soon after Gontmakher was first arrested in 2007. Arkadi's wife, Elena, said in an e-mail to CNN from the family's home in the Bridle Trails area of Bellevue that the situation ""is a true tragedy for our entire family and Arkadi himself. ""His younger son has not seen his father for more than three years, he's now turned eight years old. Our older son is now 25. We are extremely worried for Arkadi, especially now, when he badly needs qualified surgery,"" she wrote. ""We don't see an end to this police persecution. How long can an innocent man be tormented after having been acquitted by a jury trial?""","Crab merchant Arkadi Gontmakher says he is in poor health .

"London (CNN) -- It's midsummer in London and it's raining. For once, however, everyone seems very pleased about the matter. Londoners are used to summer showers but they'd never seen anything like this as a helicopter hovered over the London Eye, scattering 100,000 poems on to the delighted crowds below. The ""Rain of Poems"" is the idea of a Chilean arts collective called Casagrande and follows similar stunts in cities that have suffered from aerial bombardment during wartime from Berlin to Santiago, Gernica to Dubrovnik. Casagrande's Cristoball Brianchi says the forthcoming Olympic Games made London the perfect target. ""This time we have included one poet from each of the countries participating in the Olympic Games so when you see all of these poems in the sky what you are seeing is the story, the literature of all these different places."" But logistics threaten to replace lyricism among Cristobal's list of priorities. ""I have become a weather specialist. I have to calculate wind direction, the wind speed as well as the rules of civil aviation."" In the event, Cristobal's command of wind speed proves inadequate and the first batch of poems is carried away from the crowd, sending people scurrying through side streets in pursuit of poetry. Eventually, the chopper moves to a more suitable position from which the delightful deluge can hit its mark. Soon Jubilee Gardens are full of laughter as poem-baggers run to and fro, leaping in the air and diving on the grass to snare their quarry. If Â£50 notes had replaced the bookmark-sized poems there could barely have been a happier response. The ""Rain of Poems"" marks the beginning of what is being described as the biggest ever gathering of international poets. The event is called ""Poetry Parnassus"" -- named after Mount Parnassus, known in Greek mythology as the spiritual home of poetry, the stamping ground of the lyricist Orpheus and the hang-out for the Muses. The event has attracted poets of all ages, continents and literary stature -- from Nobel Laureates Seamus Heaney (Ireland) and Wole Soyinka (Nigeria) to Poet Laureates Kay Ryan (U.S.) to Bill Manhire (New Zealand). Many arrived in London with incredible stories to tell. Jang Jin Seong was court poet to North Korea's Kim Jong-il. When his disillusionment with the regime became too much to bear he fled across the Tumen River carrying seventy of his poems. He now lives in South Korea separated from his family but free to express his thoughts about his native country. Poetry Parnassus is part of the South Bank Centre's ""Festival of the World,"" in turn part of the Cultural Olympiad, designed to spread the Olympic fervor beyond sport to the arts. Londoners at the ""Rain of Poems"" embraced this idea. ""It's very important because not everyone has tickets for the Olympics so events like this mean everyone can take part."" ""A lot of the things that are in the Cultural Olympics are free and you don't have to pay an extortionate amount to go and see a celebration when you've got a thousand people here having fun and all it is is poems falling from the sky, which is something that doesn't happen every day."" A beaming among the crowds turned out to be Christian Leon -- Cultural Attache at London's Chilean Embassy, who was proud that his countrymen had staged the Rain of Poems. ""You feel like a little child running to catch one of those lovely poems and as you know Chile is the country of poets with two Nobel Prizes in Literature -- both of them poets. It's the best thing we can bring to this country in order to celebrate the Olympics."" As the deluge of verse continued, people on the ground began to get in touch with their own inner poet. The area was soon awash with whimsical people reading aloud to each other. A team of cleaners was on hand to gather up any mess -- in the event most of the poems were gathered up and taken home by those who found them -- and any poems which fell in the nearby River Thames were designed to dissolve, leaving no trace of poetry on the ground. But it was clear that poetry had left its mark on many who witnessed the curious event. People like Attache Leon, who told us: ""Poetry is life. Poetry is happiness. Poetry is absolutely everything!""","Helicopter hovers over central London, scattering 100,000 poems on to delighted crowds .

"(CNN) -- As football's reputation continues to be dragged through the mud following accusations of bribery during the FIFA World Cup bidding process, the man charged with repairing the sport's image revealed he is close to concluding his investigation. New York lawyer Michael Garcia, who is set to meet Qatari officials in Oman following allegations of wrongdoing, will finish his work on June 9 before publishing his report six weeks later. In a statement published Monday, his office said: ""After months of interviewing witnesses and gathering materials, we intend to complete that phase of our investigation by June 9, 2014, and to submit a report to the Adjudicatory Chamber approximately 6 weeks thereafter. The report will consider all evidence potentially related to the bidding process, including evidence collected from prior investigations."" The statement comes a day after allegations surfaced claiming a Qatari official paid more than $5million in an attempt to secure support for his country's successful bid to host the 2022 tournament. According to allegations in The Sunday Times, Mohamed bin Hammam made secret payments to soccer officials in the run up to the controversial ballot. Bin Hammam, the former president of the Asian Football Confederation, was a member of FIFA's powerful 24-person executive committee charged with voting on who hosted the finals at the time of the vote in 2010. Despite the country's small size, a technical report from FIFA calling its bid ""high risk"" and summer temperatures that can exceed 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit), Qatar shocked the world by winning the right to host the 2022 finals, defeating bids by the United States, Australia, Japan and South Korea. FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce has said he would back a re-vote, potentially opening the possibility of the U.S. staging the 2022 tournament. Mark Pieth, who heads the FIFA Independent Governance Committee, believes the latest allegations could ""shake FIFA to its foundations"". He told CNN: ""It's the first time that an institution like FIFA has to ask itself whether it should totally re-run the decision of a host, the hosting decision, and the consequences could be massive. It could be about billions of dollars. ""At the moment, we have two options open. We could say 'OK, let's have the evidence, let's run the case'. ""The problem is that there are two appeal bodies, this could drag on for two or three years, and in two or three years a lot has been planned and built, so the price tag is going to be really high. ""We've heard enough of Qatar now, let's call a stop immediately, but the difficulty there is, who is going to prove corruption, right now? ""What we have at the moment is, obviously, emails and they would have to be tested, whether they're genuine, they could be fake, so there has to be a thorough investigation conducted under all circumstances."" When FIFA voted on who should host the 2022 World Cup in 2010, the organization 's president Sepp Blatter reportedly voted for the U.S., while a potential rival for the presidency, UEFA chief Michel Platini, voted for Qatar. The Sunday Times claims to have seen millions of e-mails detailing payments to officials in the Caribbean, Africa and the Pacific designed to secure support for the tiny, gas-rich Middle Eastern emirate's quixotic bid to host the world's most popular sports tournament. ""Bit by bit, we have been unraveling it and finally we hit the mother lode,"" Sarah Baxter, deputy editor of the Sunday Times, told CNN in an interview. ""We've seen millions of documents that prove without a shadow of doubt that corruption was involved. There is clear evidence linking payments to people who have influence over the decision of who hosted the World Cup. ""You also have a bunch of officials with a bearing on the vote begging favors. They were prepared to sell their influence. What bin Hammam was doing was buying people up who could have influence."" Mohamed bin Hammam responded by saying he would not be making any comments other than he believed ""that the truth will find its way to (the) public one way or another."" The Qatar 2022 bid committee strenuously denies any wrongdoing or knowledge of any payments made on its behalf. ""Mohamed bin Hammam played no official or unofficial role in Qatar's 2022 Bid Committee,"" it said in a statement sent to CNN. ""As was the case with every other member of FIFA's executive committee, our bid team had to convince Mr. bin Hammam of the merits of our bid. ... ""Following today's newspaper articles, we vehemently deny all allegations of wrongdoing. ""We will take whatever steps are necessary to defend the integrity of Qatar's bid and our lawyers are looking into this matter. ""The right to host the tournament was won because it was the best bid and because it is time for the Middle East to host its first FIFA World Cup."" Almost as soon as Qatar won the bid to host the 2022 World Cup finals, the process was dogged by allegations of bribery and corruption. In the run-up to the 2010 vote, two FIFA executive committee members were suspended after another Sunday Times investigation filmed Nigeria's Amos Adamu and Tahiti's Reynald Temarii appearing to offer to sell their votes in exchange for money. Bin Hammam was banned from all football-related activities for life after first being accused of offering bribes to soccer officials in the Caribbean seeking support for his doomed 2011 bid to replace Sepp Blatter as FIFA president. He was cleared of those allegations after a hearing at the Court of Arbitration for Sport but was later banned for different ""conflict of interest"" charges relating to his time as AFC president. The Sunday Times' allegations come ahead of a FIFA-commissioned ethics investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments. That two-year investigation has been led by Garcia. ""We are cooperating fully with Mr. Garcia's ongoing investigation and remain totally confident that any objective enquiry (sic) will conclude we won the bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup fairly,"" the Qatar bid team added in its statement.""","Michael Garcia to finish investigation into World Cup bids .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Naomi Klein's 2000 book ""No Logo"" galvanized a generation to resist the lure of brands and corporatization. Bono, rock star and new style activist . Direct action such as protests and guerilla tactics such as culture jamming and graffiti were encouraged. Back then the movement had teeth and energy, but very quickly it has not just deflated but sharply turned into a world of hyper consumption, according to Klein. Welcome to the Pro-Logo generation that is more likely to buy a wristband and ticket to Live Earth than hit the streets in protest. Speaking this week at the Cheltenham Literature Festival in the UK,  to promote her new book ""The Shock Doctrine,"" Klein attacked the ""Bono-ization"" of the protest movement, referring to U2 frontman Bono who is also an active anti-poverty campaigner. ""The Bono-ization of protest particularly in the UK has reduced discussion to a much safer terrain."" Referring to the Make Poverty History Campaign at Gleneagles in 2005 she said, ""It was the stadium rock model of protest -- there's celebrities and there's spectators waving their bracelets. It's less dangerous and less powerful (than grass roots street demonstrations.)"" Speaking to CNN.com, Klein said the new style of anti-poverty campaigning, where celebrities talk directly with government and business leaders on behalf of a continent (such as Africa) is another form of ""noblesse oblige"" where the rich and powerful club together to 'give something back.' ""They are saying we don't even need government anymore, it's the replacement of nation states with corporate rule -- this Billionaires Club, including Bill Clinton that gets together to give a little something back."" ""What's complicated about the space that Bono and Geldof (Bob Geldof, founder of Live Aid) are occupying is that it's inside and outside at the same time -- there's no difference. What's significant about the Seattle movement (the WTO protests in 1999 and 2000) is that it's less the tactics but the fact that it identifies that there are real power differences, winners and losers in this economic model."" Klein believes when celebrities such as Bono engage in talks with world leaders at forums such as Davos they are legitimizing the structures in place, and the inequalities that arise from these structures, rather than promoting any radical change; ""The story of globalization is the story of inequality. What's been lost in the Bono-ization is ability to change these power structures. There are still the winners and losers, people who are locked in to the power structures and those locked out."" Protests such as the Seattle anti-globalization protests, ""were really demanding a structural change."" But now but according to Klein, the rise in blogging and on-line protests has taken the heat out of direct action. ""It's safer to mouth off in a blog than put your body on the line. The Internet is an amazing organizing tool but it also acts as a release, with the ability to rant and get instant catharsis. It's taken that sense of urgency away."" Bono's Red initiative is emblematic of this new Pro-Logo age. He announced a new branded product range at the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland last year called Product Red. American Express, Converse, Armani and Gap were initial partners, joined later by Apple and Motorola. The corporations sell Red branded products, with a percentage of profits going to Bono approved causes. In this Pro-Logo world there is an irony of consuming to end poverty. Perhaps an even bigger irony: through initiatives like the Red card, consumer culture and branding is buying a stake in anti-globalization and alleviating poverty movement. Klein says, ""What they've tapped into is a market niche. There's nothing that's inherently wrong with these initiatives except when they make radical claims that it's going to end poverty. There's a long history of radical consumption -- what's pretty unbelievable about this (the Red Label) is that they say it's revolutionary and it's going to replace other forms of politics."" Instead Klein advocates for a more confrontational and engaged form of activism, ""We have had mass social movements that are messy -- and that leads to some kind of negotiation and some kind of representation. What I see from the Bono camp is that they dismiss street protest as bunch as gripers whereas they (Bono) are being constructive because they engaging with power (but) if you look at the history of the labor movement its people outside trying to enforce change."" CNN spoke to a London-based activist Susie (who did not wish to give her real name) from the Climate Camp who said ""charity concerts are pathetic, just pathetic and a way to recorporate the issue. It changes nothing. It's enjoyable but (from a political point of view) it's a waste of time. It diverts attention away from taking action and protest. Nobody ever changes anything from attending a concert."" Klein agrees saying, ""I think people go to concerts because it's fun but I don't get a sense from anyone I talk to that it's effective politically."" Long time human rights activist, Peter Tatchell says despite the huge numbers marching in the anti-Iraq war marches three years ago, ""There is a sense of political powerlessness plus there's been a shift to the right."" He sees the Bono-ization effect in the way ""the protest movement has been incorporated -- the corporate agenda around consumerism and spending has just become another form of protest."" Yet he does see the value in having people working with power to effect change: ""The classic model of social change is that you need people on the inside talking to people in power and people on the outside shaking up the establishment -- a combination of the two getting results. The good cop, bad cop routine seems to have worked in the past.""  E-mail to a friend .","Protest movement shifts with rock star activists' involvement .

"(CNN) -- The family of a woman who died last year while in police custody at Phoenix, Arizona's, Sky Harbor International Airport filed an $8 million claim Wednesday against the city of Phoenix and its police department, the first step in filing a wrongful death suit. Carol Gotbaum, shown in an undated family photo, died accidentally, a medical examiner said. Carol Gotbaum, a 45-year-old mother of three from New York traveling to Tucson, Arizona, to enter an alcohol rehabilitation center, was taken into custody by Phoenix police on September 28 after she missed her connecting flight and flew into a rage. She was left alone in a holding cell at the airport and subsequently died, accidentally strangling herself while trying to escape her handcuffs. The claim accuses the Police Department of using ""excessive and unreasonable force"" on Gotbaum and failing to follow its own procedures in handling people who are obviously disturbed. ""Good people here made lethal, unreasonable mistakes, with catastrophic results for Carol, her three small children and for her husband,"" the claim says. Gotbaum was treated ""as if she was a dangerous criminal, rather than as a sick, intoxicated and vulnerable person she was,"" it says. ""She had no weapon and never threatened anyone."" City attorneys responded to the claim, saying that police officers acted properly and responsibly in restraining Gotbaum. ""The Gotbaum family has publicly admitted, not only that Carol hid her medical and mental condition, but that the officers responded to Carol exactly the way her husband knew they would respond because they did not have critical information known only to the Gotbaum family,"" city attorneys representing the Police Department wrote. Gotbaum, the stepdaughter-in-law of New York public advocate Betsy Gotbaum, became agitated after missing her flight when gate agents were unable to seat her on a subsequent flight. Airport surveillance video shows Gotbaum's arrest, with police officers struggling to handcuff her. Police reports say she was ""uncooperative"" and resisted arrest, screaming during their attempts to escort her out of the airport terminal. She was accused of disorderly conduct and placed in a holding cell at the airport, where she continued to scream for several minutes after police left the room. Shortly after she stopped screaming, an officer found her unconscious, and rescuers were unable to resuscitate her. The Maricopa County medical examiner ruled that her death was an accidental hanging. E-mail to a friend .","Police took Carol Gotbaum into custody after she missed a flight, flew into a rage .

"(CNN) -- An ex-judge accusing Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez of manipulating court rulings is a fugitive who ""sold his soul to the devil"" when he agreed to talk with U.S. investigators, the nation's foreign minister said Thursday. ""People like him will keep being defeated and his lies will be unveiled,"" Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro said. Eladio Aponte Aponte, who was a Supreme Court justice until the Venezuelan government accused him of connections with an alleged drug trafficker last month, told SOiTV in an interview that aired this week that he made rulings in cases based on requests from Chavez and other top officials. ""They just asked for favors that I complied with. And woe be the judge that refused to cooperate. ... They were dismissed,"" Aponte Aponte said. Top Venezuelan authorities were aware of at least one instance in which a military lieutenant was caught transporting cocaine to an army camp -- and made personal phone calls asking the judge to look the other way, Aponte Aponte told the Miami-based TV network. CNN has not independently confirmed the former justice's accusations. In recent years, the U.S. Treasury Department has placed several Venezuelan officials, including the nation's current defense minister, on its drug kingpin list. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration flew Aponte Aponte to the United States from Costa Rica early Monday morning, according to the head of the Central American country's intelligence agency. Mauricio Boraschi said U.S. Embassy officials contacted the Costa Rican government after the former judge -- who had been in Costa Rica for about two weeks -- reached out to officials in Washington. The U.S. State Department told CNN it could not comment on what it called ""this law enforcement matter."" Venezuela's foreign minister criticized the United States for attempting to destabilize his country's government. ""It is easy to understand how a fugitive from justice processed for his connections with drug trafficking mafias and removed from his job has sold his soul to the DEA,"" Maduro said. ""The DEA has appeared again as a political actor in Venezuela against Venezuela."" The DEA has not commented on Aponte Aponte. An agency official who watched portions of the interview that aired on CNN en EspaÃ±ol said it was ""very interesting."" The former justice told SOiTV that high-ranking Venezuelan officials were involved in drug trafficking, but declined to say who or offer evidence. In one instance, Aponte Aponte said, Chavez's office called and asked for the former judge's help after a military lieutenant was caught with cocaine. So did the nation's defense minister and other top officials, Aponte Aponte said. They said ""he was a good guy, that it was the president's order, that the president was very interested in the case,"" Aponte Aponte said. The former judge also described weekly meetings in the Venezuelan vice president's office with the president of the Supreme Court, the attorney general and other top officials. ""That is where the directives of the justice system come from. ... They decide what guidelines to follow depending on the political climate,"" he said. Aponte Aponte also said the nation's prosecutors participated in extortion and had asked him to ""orchestrate cases."" The attorney general's office did not respond to requests for comment. Several of Aponte Aponte's remarks contradicted previous statements by top Venezuelan officials -- including Chavez. When asked whether there were political prisoners in Venezuela -- something Chavez has previously denied -- Aponte Aponte said yes. ""There are people they ordered not to be released. ... In a nutshell, we had to accept the fact that they were not to be released, so the justice system turned its back on them,"" he said. Asked whether he felt that the Venezuelan government had turned against him, Aponte Aponte said, ""I think they did that a long time ago. I just didn't realize it."" Venezuelan officials removed Aponte Aponte from his post last month, accusing him of providing a government credential to a man authorities allege was one of the world's top drug lords. Aponte Aponte, who has not confirmed or denied that accusation, left Venezuela the day he was supposed to face questioning in the Venezuelan National Assembly. A government ethics commission said the judge had committed ""serious misconduct"" and a ""breach of public ethics"" when he allegedly provided a credential to suspected drug trafficker Walid Makled. Makled is currently on trial in Venezuela, where he is accused of drug trafficking and killing a journalist who was investigating his family. He was extradited to Venezuela from Colombia last year. The United States designated Makled as one of the world's most significant drug kingpins in May 2009 and had also requested his extradition. Makled, who denies U.S. accusations of drug trafficking, said in an interview with Venezuela's El Nacional newspaper that he paid millions of dollars to government officials and top military brass so his family's shipping business could operate at some of the nation's largest ports. ""If I am a narcotrafficker, the whole Chavez government is a narcotrafficker,"" he told the newspaper. Chavez has strongly denied those accusations and stood up for his government officials. Maduro said Thursday that Aponte Aponte's removal from office showed that ""in Venezuela the laws work. No one is privileged or protected."" Aponte Aponte told SOiTV that his daughter had invited Makled to her wedding, ""but we didn't have any idea of the activities of this gentleman. We only knew him as a reputable businessman."" The former judge claimed Venezuelan officials had unfairly used the Makled case to destroy his reputation. ""I am not going to pay for a crime I never committed,"" Aponte Aponte told SOiTV, but he said he wants to make up for the harm his rulings have caused. ""When I finished packing all my stuff in my office, all my books, I told myself I'd never touch another law book. Justice is nothing, justice is a ball of putty. I say putty because it can be molded, for or against. I didn't want to have anything to do with the law anymore. I said I'd rather have a hotdog stand,"" he said. ""But then, after all my reflection, and I had time to think it over, and after I saw that, that my friends have offered to help me, I now think you need to fight for justice. And that blindfolded lady has to be shown the way."" Saying he felt afraid for his life and betrayed by his colleagues, the former judge said he would go back to Venezuela to face the accusations against him only if officials respect his rights. ""Knowing the system from the inside, and how it works, and how it's handled, I don't think I'd have any rights at all,"" he said. CNN's Fernando del Rincon, Ana Maria Luengo-Romero, Jamie Crawford and Terry Frieden contributed to this report.","NEW: Ex-judge said the nation's prosecutors had asked him to ""orchestrate cases""

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraqi President Jalal Talabani has blasted the United States for the arrest Thursday of an Iranian and called for his immediate release. Iraqi President Jalal Talabani says an Iranian detained by the U.S. was a civil servant on a trade mission. The U.S. military said the detainee is a member of an elite Iranian unit that has been accused of training and equipping insurgents in Iraq, but Talabani said he is a civil servant who was on an official trade mission in Iraq's Kurdistan region. The ""letter of resentment"" was dated Thursday and addressed to Ryan Crocker, U.S. ambassador to Iraq, and Gen. John Petraeus. Presumably, the Iraqi president was referring to U.S. Gen. David Petraeus, commander of multinational forces in Iraq. Iraqi and Kurdish regional government representatives were aware of the man's presence, Talabani wrote. As a result of the incident, Tehran threatened to close its border with the Kurdistan region unless the detainee, identified as Agay Mahmoody Farhadi, is released. Closing the border would cause ""severe damage to markets and trade in the province on this blessed month,"" Talabani said, referring to Ramadan. ""Therefore, I express to you our outrage for these American forces arresting this Iranian civil official visitor without informing or cooperating with the government of the Kurdistan region, which means insult and disregard for its rights,"" he wrote. ""I call for his release immediately in the interest of the Iraq Kurdistan region and the Iranian-Iraqi relations."" The detainee belongs to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps-Quds Force, ""a covert action arm of the Iranian government responsible for aiding lethal attacks against the Iraqi government and coalition forces,"" the U.S. military said. The military said the man ""has been involved in transporting improvised explosive devices and explosively formed penetrators into Iraq. Intelligence reports also indicate he was involved in the infiltration and training of foreign terrorists in Iraq."" He is one of several Iranians in U.S. custody in Iraq.

"Des Moines, Iowa (CNN) -- Paul Ryan's four years at Miami University, a bucolic campus nestled in the small town of Oxford, Ohio, helped to shape the Wisconsin congressman's political and ideological views. An economics professor named Richard Hart guided Ryan through the classics of conservative economic theory, and Ryan soon came to revere thinkers such as Ludwig von Mises, Ayn Rand, Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman. But Ryan, who graduated in 1992, didn't spend all his time in the classroom. Ryan was also a Delt -- a member of Delta Tau Delta, one of many fraternities on a campus where Greek life reigns. He also had a fondness for turtlenecks apparently. That's according to several group photos of the fraternity that appeared in the 1989, 1990 and 1992 editions of Recensio, Miami's yearbook. The pictures were passed along by a Democratic researcher sent to Miami's campus after Mitt Romney tapped Ryan as his running mate. Ryan is one of many Delta Tau Delta alumni who have entered politics, and the second vice presidential candidate to emerge from the fraternity nationally: Alben Barkley, a longtime senator from Kentucky, was vice president during Harry Truman's second term. Other notable Delts from around the country include actor Will Ferrell, journalist Roger Mudd, former NFL star John Elway, former R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck and Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear. Delta Tau Delta brothers on campus at Miami reacted with excitement at the news of Ryan's selection as Romney's No. 2. ""Pretty damn cool to say that a VP candidate was raging in the same fraternity house as me 20 years ago,"" tweeted one Miami undergrad Saturday when Romney announced his pick.","Miami University in Ohio helped to shape Rep.

"Charlottesville, Virginia (CNN) -- A few months ago I had the opportunity to say goodbye to Elizabeth. Knowing her time was limited, Elizabeth Edwards visited Japan, where I am stationed, to show her children where she spent much of her childhood. She had endless fond memories. Her father and family had been stationed here with the Navy. It was unclear whether she would be healthy enough to make the trip, but right before she came she wrote me, apologizing for being disorganized, and asked if we would have time to see her.  The last time I had seen her was at her home in North Carolina, right after the campaign ended.  Much had changed between then and now. Elizabeth brought her family down from Tokyo to the base in Yokosuka, riding the public train, to meet us on the Navy base -- a base she remembered roller skating on as a child. We had lunch in the Officers Club, where we all ordered hamburgers, and began to catch up on life.  She shared stories of what the Officers Club meant to her as a child and talked about how she always felt that she had an instant family around the Navy.  Her children who came with her, Jack and Emma-Claire, were perfectly behaved, listening to their mother and talking about the Ninja stars they had just bought. She agreed to tour my office, where she graciously met the other judge advocates general, allowed pictures to be taken with her, and spoke to everyone about her experiences in the Navy. Very much in character, she also took the opportunity to share some specific policy ideas she had to help military families. On a family vacation, toward the end of her life, she was still looking for ways to engage with anyone she could on ideas to improve the lives of others. When John and the two kids went on a tour of one of the ships, she stayed behind. Walking up and down ladders and around a ship would have been too much for her weak body.  So, I stayed with her in an air-conditioned car outside of the ship's gate, and for an hour and a half we talked. We talked about everything, including what had happened during the campaign and what she had been going through afterward. I expressed my disappointment in them, and told her how deeply hurt those of us who put our lives into the causes they championed were by what happened. They were our heroes, my heroes, and we were let down. She listened. She told me her story, what she knew, what ate her up inside as well, but she wasn't defensive. It was her life that had been turned upside down, but she let me have my closure. On this July day, she was as she only knew how to be, totally raw.  She told me then that she didn't know how much more time she had.  She feared most for her children, and what would happen to them when she was gone. How would they fare without a mother?  She wanted to see Cate get married and watch the kids grow up. She was frustrated that her ability to work on the causes she still cared deeply about (there were many) was hampered by her husband's actions.  She worried about the future.  But she was humble, tested and gracious enough to know that life wasn't always about what you wanted. She told me that she had come to believe life isn't valued by how many years we have on Earth, but rather by how many good years we have.  And she wanted to live her life out, whatever little she had left, to the fullest. After visiting on base she took the kids shopping in Yokohama, and then we all went to a Japanese baseball game that night.  At the game we talked politics, ate ramen, laughed about memories of trekking through Iowa in December and January together, and rooted for players in Japanese.  She gave me advice for my career and excitedly explained to me the business model for her furniture store in North Carolina. She stayed six innings before getting tired. We hugged, and she whispered to me that she was proud of me. Then, for the last time, we said goodbye. She was smiling. What made Elizabeth so special was how wonderfully human she was. She embodied in everything she did the entirety of the human experience. She was passionate, edgy, classy, beautiful, unvarnished and sometimes awkward. To many she was frustrating, tough, and stubborn. To many more she was inspirational, intellectual, loving, curious, optimistic and nurturing.  She wasn't perfect. Yet there was so much beauty in her imperfection.  And America fell in love with this beauty. Much in her life was tragic, but she never let herself be a tragedy.  Despite the anger and sadness she felt from the challenges life brought her, she never stopped living life on her terms, and sharing her amazing life with us. Thank you for all the good years, Elizabeth.  We are more grateful than you could ever know, and we miss you already. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Josh Fryday.","Josh Fryday, a friend of Elizabeth Edwards, said goodbye a few months ago .

"(CNN) -- ""Until death do us part"" is what generations of couples have vowed at the altar. But a legislator in Mexico City wants to give people a much shorter option. Leonel Luna from the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution wants to make it easier for couples to divorce if things don't work out the way they hoped in the first two years after tying the knot. The bill is at the center of a controversy about family values and the definition of marriage in Mexico City. But Luna, who introduced the bill at Mexico City's Legislative Assembly last week, says his measure is simply a reflection of reality. ""Almost 50% of couples in Mexico City end up in divorce,"" Luna says. ""What we're trying to do is acknowledging reality and creating a mechanism that will allow couples to end their marriage without going through the additional pain and suffering of a legal battle."" Luna uses statistics from the Mexico City registry to illustrate his point. Out of 33,000 couples who got married in the past two years in Mexico City, around 16,000 filed for divorce. Ending the marriage, Luna says, costs approximately $3,500. The couple normally spends anywhere from $1,000 to $1,500 in legal fees and attorneys and the Mexico City legal system absorbs the rest. Under Luna's bill, couples would sign a marriage contract that would last two years. Once that term was over, the couple would have the option to renew. The contract would specify if property is owned by both spouses or separately. It would also state who would get custody of the children, if any, and how benefits would be distributed. The bill is now in committee. It may take up to three weeks before it is voted on in front of the full legislative assembly. If approved, the bill would apply only to couples getting married in Mexico City. But is there a demand for it? Norma Ojeda, a sociologist at San Diego State University who has researched marriage and divorce in Mexico, said that at first glance, the proposal seems like an unnecessary law that would simply create more bureaucracy. As it is, she said, the majority of marriage dissolutions in Mexico -- 70% -- come not from a formal divorce but from informal separation. Costs, as Luna pointed out, are an obstacle to divorce, but to date, couples have dealt with that simply by splitting and starting new families in many cases. Ojeda did say, however, that a temporary contract could provide additional protection for children whose parents split, whose needs are often overlooked in informal separations. Jorge Perez, a Mexico City resident, said the bill would benefit many couples who tie the knot in a rush. ""It's like renewing your vows (after two years) if you want. If there's a fight, they can plan what to do from the beginning"" of the marriage, Perez said. Angelica Cesar, who also lives in Mexico City, strongly disagrees with the bill. ""If you're making a commitment to share your life with someone, it better be for more than two years. It has to be for the rest of your life,"" Cesar said. As a country, Mexico has the second largest Catholic population in the world after Brazil, and many say the bill goes against the beliefs of most Mexicans. But things are different in the capital, where the population tends to be less conservative than the rest of the country. Two years ago, the liberal majority in the Mexico City legislature also made gay marriage legal in the Mexican capital. The Mexican Catholic Church denounced that law then and is strongly opposed to the passage of the two-year marriage bill. The Rev. Jose de Jesus Aguilar, a spokesman for the Mexican Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Mexico City Archdiocese, has denounced the bill. ""Mexico is suffering very serious problems precisely because we're losing family values. I think that instead of creating all kinds of comfortable rules for political purposes, legislators should focus on promoting strong marriages and family values,"" he said. Luna, the bill's author, said the chances of getting the measure passed are good. Out of 66 legislators in the Mexico City Assembly, 34 belong to his party and are likely to vote in favor of the bill. Luna said he's working on getting votes from the left-leaning Labor Party to ensure he gets the majority needed for passage. CNN's Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","Legislator Leonel Luna wants to make it easier for couples to call it quits .

"(CNN) -- An airline is investigating the removal of two imams from a flight headed to North Carolina, ostensibly because passengers felt uncomfortable with their presence of the pair -- both clad in Islamic attire. The incident occurred Friday on an Atlantic Southeast Airlines flight from Tennessee to North Carolina and it involved Masudur Rahman and Mohamed Zaghloul were wearing traditional Muslim dress, CNN affiliate WCNC reported. The two -- who hold high religious positions in the Muslim community -- were headed to North Carolina for a conference on prejudice against Muslims, or Islamaphobia. The meeting is sponsored by the North American Imams Federation. Rahman, who is a professor at the University of Memphis, told the affiliate that the incident reminded him of the prejudice Rosa Parks faced during the civil rights movement. ""That history I found today in that plane, and it shouldn't happen with any other person,"" he said. Atlantic Southeast Airlines, which operated the flight, said the incident is under investigation, and apologized ""for any inconvenience that this may have caused."" Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the civil rights group Council on American-Islamic Relations, told CNN the two men contacted his office and said they were told that passengers were uncomfortable with them on the flight. ""They went through security, even went through secondary security, and got on the plane, were taxiing out,"" he said. But then, they were taxied back, Hooper said. ""TSA came on and pulled them off and said the pilot was refusing to fly with them because passengers were uncomfortable with them,"" Hooper said, referring to the Transportation Security Administration. Hooper said officials re-screened them and found they were no threat. While officials tried to get the men back on the plane, ""the pilot absolutely refused and ultimately took off,"" Hooper said. The airlines did not say why the two men were taken off the flight, but said they were given the opportunity to fly on a different flight. ""Atlantic Southeast Airlines flight 5452 from Memphis to Charlotte returned to the gate to allow for additional screening of a passenger and the passenger's companion,"" the statement said. ""We take security and safety very seriously, and the event is currently under investigation.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan was released from home confinement at 10:20 a.m. Wednesday, 35 days after she began serving her sentence for misdemeanor theft and probation violation, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County sheriff said Wednesday. The electronic monitoring bracelet was removed from Lohan's ankle about 40 minutes before she was officially freed, spokesman Steve Whitmore said. The actress was sentenced last month to 120 days in jail after she entered a guilty plea to stealing a necklace from a jewelry store in January.  The judge had earlier sentenced her to the same jail term for violating her probation by being arrested in the theft case. The four months in jail translated into five weeks in home confinement because of jail overcrowding and state rules that allow for credit for good behavior for prisoners, Whitmore said. ""I am not happy about house arrest,"" Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Saunter said during a hearing last week. ""It was not my sentence."" Lohan must now resume work on the 480 hours of community service ordered as part of her sentence, including 360 hours at the Los Angeles Downtown Women's Center.  The last 120 hours will be served at the county morgue.  Judge Saunter gave Lohan a year to complete the community service. Her supervised probation is scheduled to end within a year, unless Lohan is charged with breaking any laws before then. It has been extended several times because of probation violations, including failed alcohol and drug tests. Lohan failed an alcohol test administered by a probation officer on June 13 and was ordered to go before the judge for a probation violation hearing last week. But Lohan's attorney convinced the judge the testing requirement had lapsed in February.  Judge Saunter ruled that Lohan is now allowed to drink alcohol and she is no longer required to take random drug tests. The actress, who turns 25 on July 2, has managed to avoid more than a few days in jail despite two drunken-driving convictions, a long list of probation violations and the recent theft conviction. ""Because of budget constraints and because we're under a federal consent decree that requires us to curb our overcrowding situation, nonviolent offenders, lesser crimes, get 20% of their sentence,"" Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said. Lohan entered drug rehab last year to avoid a jail sentence imposed by another judge. But Saunter made it clear in court last month that she didn't think drugs and alcohol were the root of Lohan's legal troubles. ""She's got other problems for which she self-medicates,"" Saunter said at her sentencing in May. Lohan's four years in and out of court -- and sometimes jail -- started with two drunken-driving arrests in 2007. Since then, she's spent more than eight months in substance-abuse rehabilitation programs. A probation report released last month said the actress ""appears to be continuing to struggle with substance abuse issues."" ""It would appear that the defendant's criminal conduct is increasing in seriousness and severity,"" the probation report said, yet it suggested she serve her sentence on probation and not in jail. Lohan tested positive for alcohol use, a violation of probation rules, in February, the report said. It also revealed that the drug test failure last August, which resulted in a jail sentence and court-ordered rehab, involved cocaine and amphetamines. CNN's Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report .","The actress served 35 days in home confinement .

"Istanbul (CNN) -- One of the world's most powerful Muslim preachers lives behind a gated compound in the small, leafy town of Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania. The reclusive Turkish cleric's name is Fethullah Gulen. If you believe the Turkish government, supporters of this cleric in Pennsylvania are spearheading a coup attempt in Turkey that is destabilizing one of America's most important allies in the Middle East. In recent weeks, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a religious conservative, has compared Gulen and his supporters to a virus and a medieval cult of assassins. Meanwhile, in an interview with CNN, a top official from Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP, called the Gulen movement a ""fifth column"" that had infiltrated the Turkish police force and judiciary. ""We are confronted by a structure that doesn't take orders from within the chain of command of the state,"" parliament member and deputy AKP chairman Mahir Unal told CNN. ""Rather, it takes orders from outside the state."" Who is this mysterious man in Pennsylvania? The 72-year old imam went into self-imposed exile when he moved from Turkey to the United States in 1999. He rarely speaks to journalists and has turned down interview requests from CNN for more than two years. But in a rare e-mail interview published in The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, Gulen denied any involvement in a political conspiracy. ""We will never be a part of any plot against those who are governing our country,"" he wrote, according to The Wall Street Journal. Muslim cleric and school spiritual leader . Supporters describe Gulen as a moderate Muslim cleric who champions interfaith dialogue. Promotional videos show him meeting with Pope John Paul II in the Vatican in the 1990s. He also repeatedly met with rabbis and Christian priests in Turkey. The preacher is best known as the spiritual leader of a network of schools and universities that operate in more than 100 countries. In the U.S., this academic empire includes Harmony Public Schools, the largest charter school network in Texas. The U.S. Department of Education awarded Harmony schools in Texas a $30 million grant after they received high scores in the government's ""Race to the Top"" education competition. Every year, students from Gulen schools around the world gather in Istanbul for a lavish series of concerts, dances and academic competitions called The Turkish Olympics. At these events, African students perform Turkish folk dances in traditional Turkish costumes before packed stadium audiences. Gulen supporter and newspaper columnist Ihsan Yilmaz insisted the schools ""are not owned by Gulen,"" but by a loose network of volunteers from the cleric's movement. ""These people know each other, they meet together, but officially speaking, (the schools) are owned by different businessmen,"" Yilmaz explained. Volunteers in the Gulen movement also own TV stations, the largest-circulation newspaper in Turkey, gold mines and at least one Turkish bank. ""There are many businessmen in Turkey who espouse the ideas of Gulen. Because starting from the 1960s, Gulen has been teaching them look, in order to be a good Muslim, you don't have to be a poor guy,"" explained Yilmaz, who is also a professor of political science at Fatih University, a Gulen-affiliated school in Istanbul. Relations with the Prime Minister . Throughout much of the last decade, the Gulen movement was also a strong Erdogan supporter. Pro-Gulen media outlets backed sprawling investigations of alleged coup plots organized by Turkish military commanders. Dozens of military officers, as well as secular writers, academics and businessmen, waited for years in prison for trials that critics called witch hunts. At that time, it also became increasingly dangerous to criticize the Gulen movement. Police arrested and imprisoned writer Ahmet Sik for more than a year, accusing him of supporting a terrorist organization. A court banned his book ""The Imam's Army,"" which took a critical look at the Gulen movement, before it was even published. Now out of prison, but still facing charges, Sik said the long-standing alliance between Turkey's two most prominent Islamic conservative leaders -- Erdogan and Gulen -- had collapsed into a bitter power struggle. ""There was a forced marriage, and the fight that began with who would lead the family is continuing as an ugly divorce,"" Sik told CNN. ""On the one side, there is the Gulen community, a dark and opaque power that can damage the most powerful administration in Turkish history. And on the other side, you have an administration that under the guise of fighting this community can and has suspended all legal and democratic principles,"" he said. In November, Erdogan announced plans to shut down privately owned preparatory schools, which help some Turkish students study for university entrance exams. Pro-Gulen media groups denounced the move, which would hurt an important part of the Gulen academic empire in Turkey. Anti-corruption raids . On December 17, police carried out a series of anti-corruption raids targeting dozens of people closely linked to the Turkish government. Among those arrested were the sons of two senior Cabinet ministers as well as the head of the state-owned HalkBank. Outlets like the pro-Gulen newspaper Today's Zaman published detailed reports alleging that police found large amounts of cash -- in the case of the bank director, stored in shoe boxes -- in the homes of some of the suspects. Erdogan denounced the allegations of graft against his government. Instead, he accused police and prosecutors of organizing a politically motivated investigation to hurt his party before nationwide municipal elections in March. The Turkish government embarked on the highly unusual mass demotion of thousands of police and prosecutors believed to be involved in the investigation. 'God is behind us' ""There is a political crisis in Turkey right now, and also a societal crisis in the sense that I've hardly seen Turkish society this polarized, this tense, this paranoid,"" said Mustafa Akyol, author of the book ""Islam Without Extremes."" ""Both sides use religious language to justify themselves,"" Akyol added. ""Both sides say 'God is behind us.' "" In a fiery speech distributed on one of his movement's websites last month, Gulen accused the Turkish government of hypocrisy. ""Those who don't see the thief but go after those trying to catch the thief, who don't see the murder but try to defame others by accusing innocent people: Let God bring fire to their houses, ruin their homes, break their unity,"" the cleric yelled while shaking his fist in anger. There are few signs that the power struggle between rival wings of the Turkish bureaucracy shows any signs of letting up. Speaking on condition of anonymity, Erdogan supporters have said that a recent series of police arrests targeting alleged al Qaeda suspects in Turkey were actually carried out by pro-Gulen police and prosecutors seeking to embarrass the Turkish government. Within hours of the anti-al Qaeda raids on January 14, a counter-terror police commander involved was reportedly demoted to his department's juvenile crimes division. As the mudslinging also continues between different factions of the Turkish media, it is highly unlikely that the enigmatic cleric, safely sequestered in Pennsylvania, will return to face the political firestorm in Turkey anytime soon.","Turkish government says group managed by Fethullah Gulen is leading a coup attempt in Turkey .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani military on Tuesday continued its deadly campaign of airstrikes against alleged militant hideouts in the country's northwest, a week after the government's peace talks with the Pakistani Taliban broke down. The series of recent bombing raids in a region considered a stronghold for extremist groups has killed scores of people and raised the question of whether a broader offensive is afoot. ""Reportedly, 30 terrorists were killed in early morning airstrikes on militants' hideouts,"" the military said in a statement Tuesday. The strikes were carried out in the Shawal Valley, which lies between North and South Waziristan, loosely governed tribal areas that border Afghanistan. They also targeted the village of Ghariom in North Waziristan, the military said. The strikes demolished some hideouts, military officials said. The area is dangerous and hard for journalists to reach, making it difficult to independently verify the military's account or to determine if any civilians have been killed or wounded. On February 19, the military carried out airstrikes in tribal areas that it said killed 15 people in North Waziristan and seven people in Khyber agency, another tribal area. ""Foreign fighters"" were among those killed, it said. More airstrikes took place in the northwest over the weekend, targeting militants in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province and the tribal areas. The military said the weekend strikes killed 38 people. Thousands of residents of the tribal areas have been fleeing the area amid the intensifying violence. About 36,000 individuals have fled North and South Waziristan in the past month, said Arshad Khan, the director general of the tribal areas' Disaster Management Authority. Many of them have been taking refuge in Bannu, a district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province that borders the tribal areas, he said. The Pakistani government said last week it had indefinitely suspended peace talks with the Pakistani Taliban. The talks, between Taliban intermediaries and a government-appointed committee, lasted for about 13 days. But the militant group carried out several deadly attacks targeting security forces and civilians during that time, including the execution of 23 abducted members of Pakistan's Frontier Corps, prompting the government to halt the negotiations. The military has stepped up its attacks on militant groups since then. Deepening the mistrust on the Pakistani Taliban side, a leading member of the group was killed in a shooting in North Waziristan earlier this week, said Shahidullah Shahid, a Taliban spokesman. He blamed the Pakistani military intelligence agency and the CIA for the killing of Asmatullah Shaheen Battani, who briefly served as interim leader of the Pakistani Taliban last year after the group's former chief Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a U.S. drone strike. The Pakistani military declined to comment Wednesday on the Taliban's accusations. A senior Pakistani government official on Tuesday told CNN's Jim Sciutto that the military was engaged in an offensive in North Waziristan to try to push the Haqqani network, an insurgent force affiliated with the Taliban and al Qaeda, out of Pakistan and across the border into Afghanistan. CNN's Sophia Saifi reported from Islamabad, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong. Journalists Adeel Raja, Saleem Mehsud and Zahir Shah Sherazi, and CNN's Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","The latest strikes hit loosely governed tribal regions that border Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- A $54.5 million program meant to cut gang violence in Chicago left out some of the most violent communities and failed to account for how the money was spent, according to a critical audit report released this week. The Neighborhood Recovery Initiative, or NRI, which was highly touted by Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn, suffered from what the state auditor general's report calls ""pervasive deficiencies"" in ""planning, implementation and management"" of the program. The NRI was supposed to be overseen by the Illinois Violence Prevention Authority, or IVPA. The report, which was publicly released Tuesday, criticized the state agency for poor oversight and said the program was rolled out too soon. ""We noted a significant number of internal control weaknesses and instances of noncompliance related to grant awarding, administration and monitoring including missing documentation, incomplete and untimely application review or approvals ... untimely and incomplete monitoring reports lacking approval dates, lack of site visits, unapproved budget reallocations and untimely recovery of unspent grant funds,"" the audit report said. Illinois set up the NRI program with 23 lead agencies, which contracted with smaller community groups to provide services. As of January, the audit had found $2 million in unspent funds that the state could not explain. Examining a sample of the agencies participating in the program, state auditors ""questioned 40 percent of the NRI expenses,"" the report said. In many cases, there was missing documentation and receipts that did not match the amounts submitted by the state for reimbursement. A CNN investigation in December 2012 found that the NRI program paid at-risk teens to hand out fliers promoting inner peace, take field trips to museums, march in a parade with the governor and even attend a yoga class to learn how to handle stress. Critics said the program was a way for Quinn to boost his gubernatorial race in 2010 since he announced the anti-violence initiative just one month before the election. Two years after the program was implemented, there was a 20% increase in murders in Chicago. The number of murders went down last year. Supporters said the program kept teens off the streets of Chicago's most dangerous neighborhoods. But the audit found that the communities selected by the program ""were not all the most violent in terms of total crime in the Chicago area."" Of the 20 most violent neighborhoods in Chicago, seven were excluded from the program, the report found. Judge rules Chicago gun ban is unconstitutional . In an e-mail to CNN, a spokesman for the Illinois governor wrote that the issues raised in the audit were resolved more than a year ago. ""When the governor's office became aware of the issues with IVPA in 2012, the administration acted quickly and, working with the Attorney General's Office and the General Assembly, passed legislation to have ICJIA (the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority) take over the authority,"" the e-mail said. ""The ICJIA has taken major steps to ensure responsible management of this critical violence prevention program and this issue has since been resolved. We are committed to providing effective work and educational opportunities for our youth to help prevent violence in communities across Illinois."" But that isn't enough for some Republican lawmakers. They have asked for further review of the NRI program as well as freezing any unspent money, which they said could be as much as $33 million. ""I've spent 32 years in law enforcement, and the information I'm looking at is the kind of information indictments are made of,"" said Illinois state Sen. Tim Bivins, R-Dixon. ""This warrants, in my estimation, a criminal investigation."" Calling the NRI program a ""shameful waste of taxpayers' dollars,"" state Sen. Matt Murphy said there was ""no documentation, no monitoring, no attempt to recover funds. We need to get this information to the appropriate law enforcement authorities and freeze the spending."" Most of the funding for the program was from the governor's discretionary fund, with the remainder from general reserve funds. Quinn told CNN in a 2012 interview that he had to do something because of the crime rate. ""It does work when you intervene when you keep people on a positive path, doing good things for their community instead of getting involved with gangbangers and drug dealers that afflict many communities, and use violence to kill children in particular,"" Quinn said.","Illinois' governor introduced anti-gang violence program ahead of 2010 election .

"(CNN) -- Federal health officials are investigating another possible norovirus outbreak aboard a cruise ship that just ended a Caribbean voyage. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 114 passengers and 10 crew members on the Holland America cruise ship ms Veendam suffered vomiting and diarrhea during a week-long voyage that ended Saturday. A CDC Vessel Sanitation Program environmental health officer and an epidemiologist boarded the ship when it arrived in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Saturday, the agency said. The investigators will ""conduct an environmental health assessment and evaluate the outbreak and response activities."" The CDC is also testing stool samples from the sickened passengers and crew, the agency said. Holland America officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Veendam carried 1,273 passengers and a crew of 575, the CDC said. Hundreds of people aboard two cruise ships in the Caribbean fell ill with norovirus last month. The CDC reported that norovirus hit more than 600 passengers and crew on Royal Caribbean's Explorer of the Seas in January, making it one of the biggest such outbreaks on any cruise ship in the past two decades. The Caribbean Princess, operated by Princess Cruises, cut short its seven-day Caribbean itinerary last month after 178 passengers and 11 crew members were stricken with norovirus. CDC staffers helped sanitize that ship. The Veendam got a failing grade from CDC inspectors who found multiple sanitation violations, including brown liquid dripping on clean dishes and a fly on the buffet, in September, the CDC said. ""While unacceptable for Holland America Line, the unsatisfactory score is highly unusual and an aberration,"" Holland America's Sally Andrews said last year. Inspectors don't tell cruise lines when they're going to show up, but they visit twice a year as part of the CDC's vessel sanitation inspection program. The CDC grades ships on a 100-point scale. An 85 or lower is considered a failing grade. The Veendam received a grade of 77. ""Since 1996, Veendam has received passing scores on 32 inspections,"" Andrews said. The Veendam is a 16-year-old ship, christened by actress Debbie Reynolds, that can carry 1,930 passengers and crew, according to Holland America. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.","CDC: 114 passengers and 10 crew on Holland America ship had vomiting and diarrhea .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Sanlu Group, the company at the center of China's tainted infant formula scandal, has filed for bankruptcy. Markets withdrew Sanlu milk powder in September after melamine was found as an additive. A court in Shijiazhuang, China, where the company is based, told CNN Wednesday it has received the bankruptcy application. Baby formula produced by Sanlu -- previously one of China's leading dairy producers -- was first flagged in the scandal when it recalled about 700 tons of the powdered milk in September after discovering the product was contaminated with melamine. The poisonings killed six babies and sickened 290,000 others, according to China's Xinhua news agency. Melamine is commonly used in coatings and laminates, wood adhesives, fabric coatings, ceiling tiles and flame retardants. Some Chinese dairy plants have added it to milk products to make it seem to have a higher protein level. Melamine is the same industrial contaminant from China that poisoned and killed thousands of U.S. dogs and cats last year. Health experts say ingesting melamine can lead to kidney stones, urinary tract ulcers, and eye and skin irritation. It also robs infants of much-needed nutrition. Sanlu could be taken over by Beijing Sanyuan Food Company or Wandashan Dairy, Xinhua reported. Chinese investigators found melamine in nearly 70 milk products from more than 20 companies, according to then-quality control official Li Changjiang, who was forced to resign. Thousands of tons of tainted milk powder were recalled, including pullbacks by Mengniu Dairy Group, China's largest milk producer, and Sanlu. In addition to Li's ouster, the fallout from the scandal led to arrest of at least 18 people in September and new government safety measures. New Zealand-based Fonterra, which owns a 43 percent stake in Sanlu, said the Shijiazhuang court issued the bankruptcy order against the Chinese company in response to a creditor's petition. Under the court order, according to Fonterra, a court-appointed receiver will manage Sanlu and assume responsibility ""for an orderly sale of the company's assets and payment of creditors"" within six months. ""This bankruptcy order is not a surprise to us,"" Andrew Ferrier, Fonterra's CEO, said in statement. ""We were aware that Sanlu was in a very difficult situation and faced mounting debts as a result of the melamine contamination crisis.""","Sanlu was one of China's leading dairy producers .

"London (CNN) -- Arguing that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has ""weakened the organization,"" a newly organized rival to the website known for leaking official secrets says it will launch Monday. The founders of Openleaks.org say they are former WikiLeaks members unhappy with the way WikiLeaks is being run under Assange. ""It has weakened the organization,"" one of those founders, Daniel Domscheit-Berg says in a documentary airing Sunday night on Swedish television network SVT. He said WikiLeaks has become ""too much focused on one person, and one person is always much weaker than an organization."" In an e-mail to CNN, Domscheit-Berg said the group hopes to launch its site Monday. Like WikiLeaks, which facilitates the anonymous disclosure of secret information, Openleaks says its goal is to help people deliver material to news outlets and other organizations without being identified. The Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter, citing internal Openleaks documents, reported that the new site intends to act as an intermediary, ""without a political agenda except from the dissemination of information to the media, the public, non-profit organizations, trade and union organizations and other participating groups."" Domscheit-Berg said WikiLeaks put ""everything we had"" into the high-profile disclosures of hundreds of thousands secret U.S. documents over the past five months. ""I think the wisest thing to do would have been to do this slowly, step by step, to grow the project. That did not happen,"" he says in the SVT documentary. Assange and WikiLeaks have been the focus of worldwide condemnation since their first major release of classified U.S. documents in July. Since it began disclosing more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables in November, it has been hit with denial-of-service attacks, been kicked off servers in the United States and France and lost major revenue sources. And Assange has been held in a British jail since Tuesday as he battles extradition to Sweden, which wants to question him about allegations of sexual assault. Assange has denied any wrongdoing, and supporters have called the charges an attempt to strike back him and his organization. But Domscheit-Berg said, ""If you preach transparency to everyone else, you have to be transparent yourself."" ""You have to fulfill the same standards that you expect from others,"" he told SVT. ""And I think that's where we've not been heading in the same direction philosophically anymore."" Another former WikiLeaks staffer said he had brought up his discontent with Assange, but that the WikiLeaks founder had not wanted to listen. ""Eventually this ended with me arguing with Julian about basically his dictatorial behavior, which ended in Julian saying to me that if I had a problem with him I could just 'piss off,' I quote,"" Herbert Snorreson said. WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson would not discuss disagreements between Assange and other members of the organization. But as for the planned launch of a rival group, he said, ""the more,the better."" ""Well, I'm inclined not to talk too much about the people, the few people that have decided that their interest is not with WikiLeaks anymore,"" he told SVT. ""What I hear is that some of the people are contemplating to open up their own website with the same ideal as WikiLeaks and I think that is an excellent idea and I wish them well.""","Openleaks.org says it plans to launch Monday .

"(CNN) -- My niece Sarah is one of the do-gooders with an entrepreneurial bent who's blurring nonprofit and for-profit activities. Through micro-lending, Individual Development Accounts, creative marketing and a novel kind of stock offering, these disruptors are re-imagining charitable giving and re-purposing investment tools. Now we need policies and financial instruments to catch up to the movement. Sarah is one of more than 900,000 Kiva lenders who have made more than $440 million in loans to entrepreneurs in 68 countries. Kiva is a nonprofit organization that facilitates micro-loans. Amounts as small as $25 can help someone -- usually a woman -- start or expand a business. The effects can be life changing. Starting with the $1,000 Kiva fund I gave her as a high school graduation gift, Sarah found time during college to make 30 loans totaling $1,700 to entrepreneurs in 17 countries, from Bolivia to Uganda. As folks repay the loans, Sarah keeps making new loans and helping more people change their lives. A funding pool that replenishes itself gives Kiva an edge over typical charities. With most cash donations, when the receiving organization spends the money, it's gone for good. There's a catch: Sarah can loan money to a grocer in Ghana, a farmer in Uganda and a weaver in India -- but she has not been able to loan money to entrepreneurs in the United States. Because of technical and policy issues with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, it's easier to help entrepreneurs in another country than in our own backyard. The bright folks at Kiva are creating a work-around. Kiva Zip is an experiment in ""person-to-person lending."" Using Kiva Zip, Tommy in West Helena, Arkansas, sought a loan to expand his barbecue and catfish restaurant. Tracy in Pittsburgh is seeking a loan to move her home hair salon into a commercial space. She expects expansion to create three or four jobs. Kiva Zip comes along as Grameen America is bringing its micro-lending model to more U.S. cities. Thirty years after Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus created Grameen Bank, which has extended micro-finance to 8 million people in Bangladesh, Grameen America now has branches in New York, Los Angeles, Oakland, Omaha, Indianapolis and Charlotte. Some of the business-charity hybrids are counterintuitive. While many nonprofit groups ask local businesses for donations, the reverse is uncommon. Yet Ross Baird emerged from the University of Oxford in 2009 with just that notion. He created a nonprofit organization, Village Capital, that raises rounds of capital to invest in startup companies. One foundation invented a new kind of stock offering to turn neighborhood stakeholders into real stockholders. Fulfilling its commitment to ""resident ownership,"" the Jacobs Family Foundation wanted to transfer a chunk of the equity in a commercial development project to residents living nearby. It took attorneys six years and 40 drafts to invent a way, and in 2005 Jacobs issued the first-ever Community Development IPO. Residents purchased all 50,000 units of stock, priced at $10 per share. In Philadelphia, Dr. Mariana Chilton began working with mothers who didn't have enough food. Through Witnesses to Hunger, she put the mothers in front of elected officials to advocate for federal nutrition programs. Chilton discovered that women from Witnesses to Hunger were also entrepreneurs. Hustling to put food on the table for their kids, literally, these mothers were earning $50 here and there doing hair and nails or babysitting. Problem is, no one treated these mothers as entrepreneurs. Their business activities were discouraged or penalized, either because of overly enthusiastic local government regulations or upside-down rules of federal assistance programs. The reporting requirements, intended to deter fraud, were not calibrated to accommodate modest income fluctuations associated with their entrepreneurial activities. Chilton is chipping away at change. Her team is giving mothers technical assistance to bring their micro-businesses into the mainstream. She is connecting the women to bank accounts, and Chilton's nonprofit will match deposits the mothers make into savings accounts and Individual Development Accounts. Policy changes could help. The federal nutrition benefits should diminish gradually over time, as folks get on their feet. At a moment when we need innovative thinking, the old rules still use a bright-line test to force mothers to choose between food and work. Further, we need more technical and policy advancements that make social investing easy. Few organizations have the time and resources to chase legal solutions for six years. The next generation of leaders must generate breakthrough solutions that can operate at scale. A good place to start is MCON13, which is hashtag-speak for a conference devoted to engaging the 80 million U.S. millennials in giving and volunteerism. Next month hundreds of professionals will gather in Indianapolis at MCON13 to crack the code on millennials. Expect millennials to keep blurring the lines. If Sarah can loan $50 to a farmer in Paraguay, why not a hair dresser in Philadelphia? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Bare.","John Bare: Young people are taking entrepreneurial approach to charity .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A grand jury has indicted a Long Island teenager on a charge of second-degree murder as a hate crime in the stabbing death of an Ecuadoran immigrant this month, according to the indictment, unsealed Thursday in Suffolk County District Court. Marcello Lucero, 37, was stabbed to death in an attack that police say was a hate crime. Jeffrey Conroy, 17, had been charged with first-degree manslaughter as a hate crime, one count each of gang assault and conspiracy and two counts each of attempted assault and attempted gang assault. The ""hate crime"" designation would add to any sentence imposed upon conviction. Six teenage co-defendants were arraigned Thursday on the same assault, conspiracy and gang assault charges as Conroy. One of the six faces an additional charge of criminal mischief. Marcello Lucero, 37, was walking to a friend's apartment in Patchogue, New York, when he was attacked late in the evening of November 8, police said. Officers found that he had been stabbed in the chest, and he died of his injuries. A friend with Lucero was not injured. Authorities believe that Conroy stabbed Lucero. His arraignment on the murder charge is scheduled for Monday. The seven youths were trying ""to find Latinos and to assault them,"" Suffolk County Police Detective Lt. Jack Fitzpatrick said at the time. ""That was what they went out to do that night, and that's exactly what they did do. ... They were actively seeking victims,"" he said. Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer said all seven ""admitted their involvement and their role in this crime. But all seven pleaded not guilty at their initial arraignment November 10. Attorneys for two of the boys told CNN before the unsealing Thursday that their clients are not guilty and disputed the hate crime designation. ""Anthony Hartford had no physical contact with the unfortunate victim who was stabbed,"" attorney Laurence Silverman said. ""My client denies he harbors any ill will toward any person because of race or national origin. My client comes from a mixed background. His great-grandmother was born and raised in Puerto Rico."" ""Kevin Shea is not guilty,"" attorney Steven M. Politi said. ""The charge that this was a racially motivated crime is inaccurate. ... These are young boys and should enjoy presumption of innocence, and I hope everyone reserves judgment until the facts come out."" The other defendants are Jordan Dasch, Nicholas Hausch, Christopher Overton and Jose Pacheco. All but Overton, who is 16, are 17 years old. Dasch also faces a charge of criminal mischief.","Jeffrey Conroy, 17, faces count of murder as a hate crime .

"(CNN) -- New York City officials are proposing banning the sale of large-size sodas and other sugary beverages at restaurants and food carts. ""More than half of NYC adults (58%) are overweight or obese,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg tweeted Thursday. ""We're doing something about it."" Opinion: Big Gulp? Meet Big Brother . The ban would outlaw such drinks larger than 16 ounces at restaurants, food carts and any other establishments that receive letter grades for food service. It would not apply to grocery stores. Critics -- including McDonald's and Coca-Cola, which stand to be hurt by the proposal -- quickly assailed it as ""misguided"" and ""arbitrary."" Is drinking soda really bad for you? The New York City Department of Health will submit the measure to the Board of Health on June 12. There will then be a three-month comment period before the board votes on the proposal, officials said. ""If approved, the city's proposal would take effect six months after Board of Health approval and would be enforced by the city's regular restaurant inspection team,"" a statement from Bloomberg's office said. ""Restaurant owners will have nine months from the adoption of the proposal until they face fines."" Fines will then be $200, the statement said. Soft drinks: Public enemy No. 1 in obesity fight? Speaking by satellite to the All Things D technology event in California -- a previously scheduled appearance -- Bloomberg said, ""This is something we think we have the legal authority to do. WeÂ¹re not taking away anybody's right to do something; we're simply making it different for them in how they do it."" He said he hoped the move will help lead to different behaviors. The city spends $4 billion a year on medical care for overweight people, he said. The statement from his office cited health problems facing the city, including an increase in obesity. ""The single largest driver of these alarming increases in obesity is sugary drinks, which have grown in size,"" the statement said. It was not immediately clear what that assertion was based on. Overheard on CNN.com: Doughnut lovers' lament, washed down with a giant soda . While the consumption of sugary drinks contributes to obesity, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not name a single largest cause nationally. In a report this month, the nonprofit Institute of Medicine said, despite the ""difficulty of quantifying relative contributions to the obesity epidemic, researchers have found strong associations between intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and weight gain. Although the exact mechanisms of how sugar-sweetened beverages contribute to obesity are not fully known, their link to obesity is stronger than that observed for any other food or beverage."" The New York City Health Department commissioner, Dr. Tom Farley, tweeted, ""Big sugary drinks are major contributor to obesity epidemic. We're proposing to cap them at 16 oz. in restaurants."" Eatocracy: How I kicked my Coke habit . ""There they go again,"" Stefan Friedman, a spokesman for the New York City Beverage Association, said in a statement Thursday. ""The New York City Health Department's unhealthy obsession with attacking soft drinks is again pushing them over the top. The city is not going to address the obesity issue by attacking soda because soda is not driving the obesity rates."" McDonald's restaurants issued a statement saying, ""Public health issues cannot be effectively addressed through a narrowly focused and misguided ban. This is a complex topic, and one that requires a more collaborative and comprehensive approach."" A statement from the Coca-Cola company said the ""people of New York City are much smarter than the New York City Health Department believes. ... New Yorkers expect and deserve better than this. They can make their own choices about the beverages they purchase. We hope New Yorkers loudly voice their disapproval about this arbitrary mandate."" Bloomberg bans smoking in parks . But Center for Science in the Public Interest spokesman Jeff Cronin told CNN that his group considers the decision the ""boldest move in the country"" and ""not the first time that Mayor (Michael) Bloomberg has led the charge."" ""In the same way New York City generated momentum for calorie labeling and for getting rid of artificial trans fat, we hope this move today will start a national movement to ratchet down out of control soda serving sizes,"" Cronin said. Broad public health initiatives have become a hallmark of Bloomberg's administration. Under the mayor, the city has banned trans fats from restaurants, smoking from parks, and has placed graphic ads targeting junk food and tobacco in public transit. NY officials: Take soda out of food stamp program . The CDC says that ""many people don't realize just how many calories beverages can contribute to their daily intake."" The CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, in a brief last August, said sugar drinks ""have been linked to poor diet quality, weight gain, obesity, and, in adults, type 2 diabetes."" The American Heart Association has recommended a consumption goal of no more than 450 kilocalories of sugar-sweetened beverages -- fewer than three 12-ounce cans of carbonated cola -- per week, the report says. But Friedman, in his statement, said that ""as obesity continues to rise, CDC data shows that calories from sugar-sweetened beverages are a small and declining part of the American diet."" Beverage Digest, which tracks sales, reported that in 2011, sales of carbonated soft drinks dropped by 1%, a steeper decline than the year before. Total sales of carbonated soft drinks are down to the level they were in 1996, the report said. Per capita consumption is at its lowest since 1987, the report said. But the CDC notes that the consumption of sugar drinks -- including non-carbonated beverages -- is higher than it was 30 years ago. And part of the key to cutting calories is ""to think about what you drink,"" it says. That includes watching calories in coffee drinks and smoothies, the CDC says. Just over half -- 52% -- of calories from sugar drinks are consumed at home, the CDC brief said. CNN's Ronni Berke, Mark Norman, and Mary Snow contributed to this report.","NEW: More than half of NYC adults are overweight, Mayor Bloomberg says .

"(CNN) -- A Mexican beauty queen was killed during a weekend shootout in Sinaloa, a northern state known for drug-fueled violence, authorities said Monday. Maria Susana Flores Gamez, 20, was the 2012 Woman of Sinaloa. She was killed Saturday in a gun battle between military troops and suspected criminals in the municipality of Mocorito. Two others were also killed. Sinaloa State Attorney General Marco Antonio Higuera said a rifle was found near the beauty queen's body, but it was not clear whether she had fired it. It was also not clear who shot her. ""All we know is that it happened during a confrontation that the army had with criminals, and that she was with the group of criminals,"" he told reporters, according to a transcript from his office. Four people were detained, he said, and authorities seized various weapons, drugs and vehicles. Flores Gamez was a student of communications. She was crowned Woman of Sinaloa in February, beating more than a dozen young women for the title. In addition to the Woman of Sinaloa pageant, Flores Gamez had participated in the 2012 Our Sinaloa Beauty contest. Organizers of that pageant released a statement upon news of her death, offering condolences to the family, which received her body Monday. ""We are dismayed by the news -- a beautiful young person, happy, and with a big future ahead of her, "" the pageant organizers said. ""Rest in peace Susy."" The beauty queen is not the first in Mexico to make headlines for something other than her good looks. In 2008, Laura Zuniga, who was then the reigning Our Sinaloa Beauty, was taken into custody along with seven men. They had been traveling in two vehicles that contained AR-15 assault rifles, 38 specials, 9mm handguns, cartridges and $50,000 in cash, Luis Carlos Najera Gutierrez de Velazco, secretary of public security for the state of Jalisco, said then. She was subsequently released. More than 47,500 people have died across Mexico in drug-related violence since December 2006, when President Felipe Calderon took office and announced plans to deploy federal troops to help the government's fight against organized crime. According to Mexico's National Human Rights Commission, more than 5,300 people have disappeared throughout the country in that same time, and the bodies of 9,000 dead have not been identified.

""What we are offering is essentially a cure."" In a study published in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Guyuron and colleagues looked for people who had migraines that started in a specific region on the front, side, or back of the head. The researchers injected Botox into these trigger points to temporarily paralyze the muscle; if the injections helped relieve the migraines, the patients were randomly divided into two surgical groups. After the Botox wore off, one group had a face-lifting surgery combined with the removal of muscle tissue or nerves in the area that triggered the migraines. Fat or muscle was used to fill in the area after tissue was removed. Health.com: Quiz --Surprising migraine causes and cures . The second group had a sham procedure, in which incisions were made but all muscles and nerves remained intact. A total of 75 patients were involved in the study. In the year after the procedure, 57 percent of those who had the actual surgery reported the complete elimination of migraine headaches, compared with just 4 percent in the sham surgery group. In addition, 84 percent of those who had the surgery reported at least a 50 percent reduction in migraine pain compared with just 58 percent in the sham group. Health.com: Secrets to a stress-free home . As for side effects, one surgery patient had persistent numbness of the forehead, and 10 of 19 patients who had the procedure on the side of the head had a slight but persistent hollowing in their temple region. More than 30 million Americans experience migraine headaches. However, Robert Kunkel, M.D., a consultant at the department of neurology at the Cleveland Clinic, says this surgery probably won't become a common procedure, despite the results. Health.com: Knowing your mother's health history can lower your risks . ""This may be a technique that will help a small number of migraine patients who have responded to Botox, but it's certainly not a procedure for generally treating migraines,"" says Kunkel, who was not involved in the new study. He points out that people who had the sham surgery probably suspected that they were in the placebo group, since the face-lift would most likely have reduced wrinkling. If a treatment isn't completely blinded, it can skew a study's results; if patients suspect they've had a sham treatment, they may be less likely to say their migraines are cured. However, nearly 60 percent of the people who had the sham procedure reported some migraine relief too. Guyuron believes this could be related to a placebo effect, or the incisions could have disturbed some of the nerve branches and actually relieved migraines in some way.

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- The number of children sickened by suspected melamine-tainted milk products in China has more than doubled and apparently spread beyond mainland China -- raising fears that the impact of the tainted products could be more widespread that initially thought. China's Health Ministry announced Sunday that 12,892 infants and young children have been sickened by tainted milk powder -- more than double the number previously reported -- according to state-run Xinhua news agency. Of these, 104 have serious symptoms, and 1,579 have been cured and discharged, the agency said. Previously, Chinese officials said more than 6,200 children had been sickened by melamine found in baby formula. At least four children have died. Xinhua reported the first death from from the toxin on September 12. In addition, nearly 40,000 other infants and young children have received outpatient medical treatment and consultation as a result of the tainted milk, Xinhua reported on Sunday.  Watch CNN visit the company at the center of the scandal » . The latest statistics from mainland China come after Hong Kong reported late Saturday that a 3-year-old girl has been sickened by a suspected melamine-tainted milk product -- the first known illness outside of mainland China. The child in Hong Kong was diagnosed with a kidney stone at Princess Margaret Hospital, the government reported, citing a hospital statement. Although tests are still ongoing, her illness is suspected to be linked to consuming milk products containing melamine, the hospital statement said. The child has been released, and her condition will be monitored, it said. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Center for Food Safety announced Sunday that a sample of Nestle Dairy Farm Pure Milk, sold in one-liter packs for catering use only, had tested positive for melamine. But the Swiss company said in a news release it is ""confident"" none of its milk products made in China contains the chemical. The officials asked that retail sales of the milk for catering be halted, and that Nestle recall the product. ""The level of melamine detected in the Nestle sample was 1.4 ppm (parts per million), which the center believed is low. However, small children should not consume the product,"" the center said.  Learn more about the chemical melamine » . The other 64 samples were free from the toxic substance, according to the Hong Kong government Web site. In a news release on its Web site, Nestle did not address the report regarding its Dairy Farm Pure Milk, but it disputed press reports that -- according to Nestle -- said melamine was found in its powdered toddler milk formula, NESLAC Gold 1+, designed for children ages 1 to 3. ""Following press reports in Hong Kong earlier today claiming that traces of melamine had been found in a Nestle growing up milk, Nestle is confident that none of its products in China is made from milk adulterated with melamine,"" the company said. ""The Hong Kong Government's Food and Environmental Health Department has just released a report declaring that NESLAC Gold 1+, which was mentioned in the media reports, is safe and that no melamine was detected in the product,"" Nestle said. The company, based in Vevey, Switzerland, said NESLAC Gold 1+ also was tested by at least two government-approved, independent laboratories, and none of them detected melamine in the mixture. ""Over 70 different tests are routinely conducted in the course of producing infant formula and other milk products,"" Nestle said. ""In fact, the Chinese authorities have issued official certificates for all tested Nestle products stating that no melamine has been detected in any of them."" Nestle noted that ""melamine is found throughout the food chain across the world in minute traces which do not represent any health risk for consumers."" It noted that a 3-year-old would have to consume over 40 liters of milk that contained 2 ppm of melamine to exceed internationally recognized safety limits, which vary by country. Melamine is commonly used in coatings and laminates, wood adhesives, fabric coatings, ceiling tiles and flame retardants. It has shown up in testing done on milk and yogurt, prompting at least two supermarket chains in Hong Kong to pull dairy products by Mengniu and Yili from store shelves, representatives from the companies told CNN Friday. Health experts say ingesting melamine can lead to kidney stones, urinary tract ulcers, and eye and skin irritation. The Chinese State Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine said the amount of the chemical found in the milk would not cause ill effects in adults who drank less than two liters a day. More than 18 people have been arrested in the contaminant cases. Melamine is the same industrial contaminant from China that poisoned and killed thousands of U.S. dogs and cats last year. The chemical, a byproduct of plastic manufacturing, can be used to mimic high-protein additives.","NEW: Four infants dead, 12,892 sick after drinking baby formula .

"(CNN) -- In deciding last week to label one third of Americans -- fat people -- as diseased, the American Medical Association not only went against the advice of its own experts, they also failed to include anyone from fat community in that decision. There is a consensus among three groups of people -- those who proudly self-identify as fat, fat studies scholars and advocates of the Health at Every Size approach -- that the AMA is putting profits before people and redoubling its focus on weight and weight loss when that approach has, for decades, failed to produce on its promises. It doesn't make people thinner or healthier in the long term, and it encourages weight stigma, prejudice and discrimination. The AMA seems eager to expand weight-loss treatment and convince insurers to reimburse for it. Big Pharma has two new weight-loss drugs out, with users losing at most only 10% of their body weight at a monthly cost of $100 or more and possible health complications. New obesity drug Belviq to be available to certain patients . 2012: FDA-approved diet drug Qsymia available . Bariatric surgeons would doubtless like to expand insurance reimbursements for the practice of surgically interrupting healthy internal organs. And the $66 billion per year weight-loss industry has a stake, too. (Although ""weight-loss"" industry is a misnomer when so many dieters regain lost weight that repeat customers are a basic part of the industry's business model.) ""I can guarantee you that if there was no money to be had in this, the term 'obesity epidemic' would not exist,"" said clinical psychologist Peggy Elam. At news of the AMA's pronouncement, fat community members started the #IAmNotADisease hashtag on Twitter. I posted this petition on Change.org. The fat community's oldest civil rights group, the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance, proclaimed a vote of no confidence in the AMA and called for ""an immediate roundtable discussion that includes higher-weight people from every community."" As a result of the AMA's decision, fat people who face health challenges will encounter even more weight bias in medical settings and will likely encounter more difficulty obtaining treatment unrelated to weight. (The classic story in fat community involves going to the doctor with a sinus headache and being told to lose weight although many people's stories of medical weight bias are far more dire.) Weight stigma itself is a direct threat to fat people's health. ""Overall, it feels like another form of systematic discrimination and oppression,"" said blogger TaRessa Stovall. Author Lesley Kinzel wrote, ""For all of our cultural hand-wringing about how much fat people are allegedly costing health insurance companies, the AMA sure doesn't seem bothered by potentially causing an explosion of unnecessary prescriptions (and surgeries!) among the one-third of Americans who are suddenly now 'diseased.' "" When doctors rely on weight, or a phrenology-era number such as BMI, they will misidentify more than half the healthy people as unhealthy, psychologist Deb Burgard pointed out. ""They do not seem to understand that calling one-third of the natural variety in a population 'sick' is a hostile act and undermines the trust that millions of people would otherwise place in their doctors' advice,"" Burgard said. As one petition signer, Victoria Centanni, commented: ""My doctor already [attributes] all of my health problems to my being fat. [It] makes me want to avoid seeking health care for any reason."" For more than two decades, health professionals who promote the Health at Every Size concept have argued that a weight focus does no lasting good and much harm to physical and mental health and to fat people's social status. They are finding that a weight-neutral approach based in self-acceptance and social justice yields far superior results for people's health and happiness. People are able to develop enjoyable, sustainable eating and exercise habits and a positive feeling about their bodies. If the AMA truly cares about the health of fat people, they will end the war on obesity. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Marilyn Wann.","The American Medical Association classified obesity as a disease .

"(CNN) -- Violence swept across Syria on Friday, with at least 43 people reported killed in another bloody day of confrontation between government forces and demonstrators calling for political change. Reliable numbers were difficult to come by. CNN bases its figures on reports from witnesses. Amnesty International, citing local human rights activists, reported that at least 75 people were killed in Friday's protests. The Syrian government does not permit CNN to report from inside the country. The killings occurred in several flashpoint regions as thousands of Syrian protesters defiantly marched after Muslims' weekly prayers in a display of mass discontent toward the government. Violence ripped through the Damascus suburbs of Douma, Moademy, and Zamalka, and other cities -- Homs, Harasta, and Izraa. The state-run news agency reported demonstrations and clashes, citing injuries but no deaths. Human rights groups and witnesses told a different story. ""Today, they have killed so many people. There are so many people injured and people have been kidnapped,"" Wissam Tarif, a human rights activist, told CNN. ""They are acting as an armed gang, not as security forces."" The violence prompted international condemnation, with British Foreign Secretary William Hague calling the killings ""unacceptable,"" and calling on Syrian security forces ""to exercise restraint instead of repression, and on the Syrian authorities to respect the Syrian people's right to peaceful protest."" Before Friday's marches, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said the death toll had exceeded 200 since the demonstrations began in mid-March. Human rights groups had been urging the government to refrain from cracking down on peaceful turnouts during the Facebook-inspired outpouring dubbed ""Great Friday."" A witness in Douma said eight people died and approximately 25 were wounded when security forces fired on several thousand protesters. Riot police and secret police comprised the security forces and a sniper on a hospital roof was seen taking shots at people. Pellets and lethal rounds were used, the witness said, as people chanted for the downfall of the regime. A doctor in the Damascus suburb of Moadamy said six people were killed and dozens wounded when security forces fired in an ""indiscriminate and disproportionate manner"" on thousands of demonstrators. The doctor, a pediatrician, said it was difficult taking the wounded to the hospital. Syrian security forces had set up checkpoints across the area and were preventing anyone from entering or leaving the suburb. Five people were killed in the Damascus suburb of Zamalka, a witness said. An opposition leader in Homs said 12 people died and dozens were wounded when security forces fired on demonstrators. Protesters raced from the main streets for cover in smaller streets and alleys where they waited for the situation to calm. A witness said one of the dead was a 41-year-old demonstrator who was shot in the neck. Tarif said security forces fired on demonstrators from the southern city of Izraa who were trying to join protesters in nearby Daraa, killing nine and wounding others. Two people in Izraa reported seeing an assault on demonstrators and many casualties. An activist in Harasta in the south said 2,000 to 3,000 people met with a fierce crackdown by security forces, and heavy gunfire could be heard over the phone as the witness spoke. Three people have been killed and nine wounded, the source said. In protest, demonstrators burned down a police station. In Daraa, where the protests got their start last month, people shouted ""dignity and freedom!"" Activist Razan Zaitouneh in Damascus said security forces in the suburb of Sit Zainab fired on demonstrators who were tearing down a statue of Hafez al-Assad, the president's late father and the former ruler of Syria. She said three people were wounded when security forces opened fire in Hasaka in the northeast. Witnesses reported demonstrations in the capital, Damascus, where people chanted slogans and tear gas was fired amid a moderate security presence. Amateur video obtained by CNN purportedly shows demonstrations in Homs, Damascus, Banias, Kiswah, and Qamlishi. CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the material. The Syrian Arab News Agency said a ""limited number of demonstrators"" came out on Friday in the Damascus area, Hama, Deir Ezzour, Hasaka, Daraa, and Banias. It said security forces settled ""scuffles that erupted between demonstrators and citizens"" in Hama, Harasta, al-Hajar al-Aswad, and Hasaka. Demonstrations have been a daily occurrence across Syria for weeks and huge rallies have been common in the authoritarian state after Friday prayers across the predominantly Muslim nation. As people gathered to express their grievances toward the government, they've frequently been greeted with force from police. Friday's turnouts came a day after President Bashar al-Assad lifted the country's 48-year-old state of emergency and abolished the state security court, both of which were key demands of the demonstrators. The emergency law permitted the government to make preventive arrests and override constitutional and penal code statutes. The security court was a special body that prosecuted people regarded as challenging the government. Al-Assad's decrees on Thursday included recognizing and regulating the right to peaceful protest. They also extended the period that security forces can hold suspects in certain crimes. But Human Rights Watch says the decrees don't ""address the extensive immunity that Syrian law provides to members of its security services."" It urged al-Assad to undertake more change, such as releasing political prisoners and those arrested for participating in peaceful protests, order probes in security force violations, ensure detainees gain ""prompt access to a lawyer,"" and amend repressive provisions of the penal code. It said the government, which is controlled by the Baath Party, should ""enact a political parties' law in compliance with international human rights norms."" Such a law would allow the establishment of independent political parties. Hague urged the government to address the citizenry's ""legitimate demands."" ""Political reforms should be brought forward and implemented without delay,"" he said. ""The Emergency Law should be lifted in practice, not just in word."" Tarif also said that ""lifting the emergency law is a big joke while the security forces have impunity. ""This is going to become worse. Remember, tomorrow are the funerals,"" he said. U.S. President Barack Obama issued a statement in which he condemned ""in the strongest possible terms"" the use of force by the Syrian government against demonstrators. ""This outrageous use of violence to quell protests must come to an end now,"" he said. ""The Syrian people have called for the freedoms that all individuals around the world should enjoy: freedom of expression, association, peaceful assembly, and the ability to freely choose their leaders. President Assad and the Syrian authorities have repeatedly rejected their calls and chosen the path of repression."" He accused Assad of ""blaming outsiders while seeking Iranian assistance in repressing Syria's citizens through the same brutal tactics that have been used by his Iranian allies."" Obama added, ""The United States will continue to stand up for democracy and the universal rights that all human beings deserve, in Syria and around the world."" In separate statements, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the spokesman for France's Ministry of European and Foreign Affairs condemned the violence.

"(CNN) --  For many Muslims it's the journey of a lifetime: making the Hajj pilgrimage. Almost 3 million faithful, together, in the city of Mecca, Saudi Arabia. But this year, the Hajj could become an incubator for the H1N1 virus. At a Muslim community center in Duluth, Georgia, American Muslims pray and prepare for the Hajj. Lateefa Khan is here with her husband, Zakerullah. She has mixed emotions. They are leaving their children behind but say they look forward to the worship. ""It is very exciting. An amazing experience,"" Khan says. ""I am looking forward to worshipping, focusing all my time on worshipping."" Khan will take precautions to avoid H1N1, also known as swine flu, at the Hajj. They'll carry hand sanitizer and will be ""frequently washing our hands, trying to stay as clean as possible."" The Khans, along with a number of people at the center who are going on the Hajj, also are getting H1N1 inoculations. Dr. Asif Saberi gives them a short lecture on how to prepare and encourages everyone to have their shots at least seven days before traveling. He says the Saudi government is doing a lot to protect pilgrims, but ""the magnitude of the problem is the magnitude of the numbers of people who attend the Hajj."" When it comes to using hand sanitizer and wearing masks, Saberi says he encounters confusion about religious dictates and flu prevention. According to Muslim beliefs, for example, men in a state of pilgrimage should not wear any stitched items or touch alcohol. So what about wearing face masks or using alcohol-based sanitizers? ""One of the basic principles on which shariah (Islamic law) is based is the protection of the health,"" he says. ""So if protection of the health is of such paramount importance, then the ritualistic significance of not wearing stitched clothes on your body is subservient to the need to maintain good health. And therefore wearing a mask is important. Using the sanitizer, which prevents this disease from spreading to others, is important."" Saudi Arabia has been preparing for the influx of millions of pilgrims. It won't turn away anyone who wants to come to the Hajj, but it is urging other countries not to let children younger than 12, people older than 65 or pregnant women make the pilgrimage. The Saudi health minister went on television with his daughters, publicly getting their H1N1 flu shots, part of a campaign to alleviate fears about the vaccine. The kingdom also is using sophisticated technology -- thermal screening equipment at entry points and mobile devices to document suspected cases of the flu. Dr. Ziad Memish, assistant deputy to the Saudi health minister and co-author of a paper on Hajj and H1N1 published in Science magazine, said the government consulted 25 international experts, who joined with 25 Saudi experts, to discuss how to prepare. ""We had the team inspect the airport, the seaport, the regional lab that tests for the influenza,"" he said. ""And then we had a review of all the evidence regarding the different strategies that should be used to prevent the spread of the disease during the mass gathering of the Hajj. ""We have relied on a collaborative program with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where they are helping us setting up a system that was used in the Hurricane Katrina disaster, and I think the system has already been tested and it is working perfectly well."" In Washington, Louise Gresham, director of health security and epidemiology at the Nuclear Threat Initiative -- which also works to reduce global biological threats -- looks at a report tracking the spread of H1N1 in the Middle East. Gresham describes the risks: . ""Picture, if you can, that 1 million people will come together in a single mosque at any given time during the Hajj. Picture that crowding over an extended period of time, and that's a test. A test not just for each individual pilgrim, but it is a real test for disease detection."" The Nuclear Threat Initiative supports a groundbreaking surveillance system in the Middle East, called the Middle East Consortium on Infectious Disease Surveillance. It brings together public health leaders and representatives from academic institutions and private health care facilities in Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian Authority. It was started seven years ago, during the height of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. ""They actually started writing a plan for food-borne disease outbreaks, but they started a pandemic preparedness plan,"" Gresham says. ""When H1N1 came along, this put them in a perfect position, because they were practiced, they were rehearsed and they had built great, great trust."" As part of this cooperation, Israel is supplying Gaza and the West Bank with H1N1 vaccinations for those who make the religious journey. That trust, plus international cooperation, will be crucial in protecting pilgrims. For those like Fayzah Abu Ayadah, faith outweighs fear. ""Even if we die there, it is not important,"" the Palestinian says. ""The important thing is to go for the Hajj.""","Health officials fear Hajj could help spread H1N1 virus .

"(CNN) -- Michael Moore's ""Sicko,"" which opened nationwide Friday, is filled with horror stories of people who are deprived of medical service because they can't afford it or haven't been able to navigate the murky waters of managed care in the United States. A couple featured in Michael Moore's ""Sicko"" leave a London hospital with their newborn. It compares American health care with the universal coverage systems in Canada, France, the United Kingdom and Cuba. Moore covers a lot of ground. Our team investigated some of the claims put forth in his film. We found that his numbers were mostly right, but his arguments could use a little more context. As we dug deep to uncover the numbers, we found surprisingly few inaccuracies in the film. In fact, most pundits or health-care experts we spoke to spent more time on errors of omission rather than disputing the actual claims in the film. Whether it's dollars spent, group coverage or Medicaid income cutoffs, health care goes hand in hand with numbers. Moore opens his film by giving these statistics, ""Fifty million uninsured Americans ... 18,000 people die because they are uninsured."" Watch Michael Moore talk about ""Sicko"" with CNN's Larry King. » . For the most part, that's true. The latest numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say 43.6 million, or about 15 percent of Americans, were uninsured in 2006. For the past five years, the overall count has fluctuated between 41 million and 44 million people. According to the Institute of Medicine, 18,000 people do die each year mainly because they are less likely to receive screening and preventive care for chronic diseases. Moore says that the U.S. spends more of its gross domestic product on health care than any other country. Again, that's true. The United States spends more than 15 percent of its GDP on health care -- no other nation even comes close to that number. France spends about 11 percent, and Canadians spend 10 percent. Like Moore, we also found that more money does not equal better care. Both the French and Canadian systems rank in the Top 10 of the world's best health-care systems, according to the World Health Organization. The United States comes in at No. 37. The rankings are based on general health of the population, access, patient satisfaction and how the care's paid for. So, if Americans are paying so much and they're not getting as good or as much care, where is all the money going? ""Overhead for most private health insurance plans range between 10 percent to 30 percent,"" says Deloitte health-care analyst Paul Keckley. Overhead includes profit and administrative costs. ""Compare that to Medicare, which only has an overhead rate of 1 percent. Medicare is an extremely efficient health-care delivery system,"" says Mark Meaney, a health-care ethicist for the National Institute for Patient Rights. Moore spends about half his film detailing the wonders and the benefits of the government-funded universal health-care systems in Canada, France, Cuba and the United Kingdom. He shows calm, content people in waiting rooms and people getting care in hospitals hassle free. People laugh and smile as he asks about billing departments and cost of stay. Not surprisingly, it's not that simple. In most other countries, there are quotas and planned waiting times. Everyone does have access to basic levels of care. That care plan is formulated by teams of government physicians and officials who determine what's to be included in the universal basic coverage and how a specific condition is treated. If you want treatment outside of that standard plan, then you have to pay for it yourself. ""In most developed health systems in the world, 15 percent to 20 percent of the population buys medical services outside of the system of care run by the government. They do it through supplemental insurance, or they buy services out of pocket,"" Keckley says. The people who pay more tend to be in the upper income or have special, more complicated conditions. Moore focuses on the private insurance companies and makes no mention of the U.S. government-funded health-care systems such as Medicare, Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program and the Veterans Affairs health-care systems. About 50 percent of all health-care dollars spent in the United States flows through these government systems. ""Sicko"" also ignores a handful of good things about the American system. Believe it or not, the United States does rank highest in the patient satisfaction category. Americans do have shorter wait times than everyone but Germans when it comes to nonemergency elective surgery such as hip replacements, cataract removal or knee repair. That's no surprise given the number of U.S. specialists. In U.S. medical schools, students training to become primary-care physicians have dwindled to 10 percent. The overwhelming majority choose far more profitable specialties in the medical field. In other countries, more than one out of three aspiring doctors chooses primary care in part because there's less of an income gap with specialists. In those nations, becoming a specialist means making 30 percent more than a primary-care physician. In the United States, the gap is around 300 percent, according to Keckley. As Americans continue to spend $2 trillion a year on health care, everyone agrees on one point: Things need to change, and it will take more than a movie to figure out how to get there.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Blake Mycoskie founded TOMS Shoes in 2006. The socially responsible company aims to provide impoverished children with shoes in a sustainable way. Blake Mycoskie says he pursued his vision for TOMS Shoes with ""reckless ambition."" The California-based entrepreneur shares some of the lessons he learned along the way. Follow these tips and you too could launch the next big thing. Follow your passion . Despite having no background in fashion, Mycoskie relentlessly pursued his vision for TOMS. ""I had absolutely no experience in shoes or fashion so I approached the business how I have done everything in my life, and that's with reckless ambition,"" he says. He set out to learn how to make shoes and often spent weekends peddling the shoes to L.A.'s trendy spots in the early days of the company -- an effort that paid off. Establish smart partnerships . Partnerships are critical to spreading the TOMS model and creating a global brand that's known for giving, according to Mycoskie. He wants other firms to realize they can establish a ""one-for-one"" giving model through partnerships ""instead of reinventing the wheel themselves."" His goal is to expand the TOMS model and work with ""other great companies out there that are already doing great products."" Be flexible in your thinking . Mycoskie wanted to provide children in need with shoes, but was concerned a charity would not be sustainable. He could raise money from his friends and family, but worried about what would happen if his donors decided to contribute to another cause one year. But he found a solution by blending philanthropy with business. He says: ""I thought to myself, 'Okay, how can I guarantee these kids that they'll have shoes over and over again?''' ""The only way I could guarantee that was to start a business."" Know when to move on . One of his early ventures was a 24/7 reality TV channel, which he started up after appearing on ""The Amazing Race."" But two years after launching, the company faced stiff competition from media titan Rupert Murdoch. ""That really taught me a valuable lesson in business: Even if you have a great idea, the market is there and the market is right,"" Mycoskie says. He ended up shutting down the network, Reality Central, after realizing he couldn't compete with such a large player. ""You really have to look at who your competitors are. You can't compete with the biggest guy. The biggest guy has the ability to shut you down -- it's a really risky proposition."" Experience pays off . Mycoskie had already started four other businesses by the time he got the idea for TOMS. He says the experience of running those companies helped prepare him for the rapid growth of TOMS. ""I think all my entrepreneurial experience and background kind of was trained for this one moment when this gigantic idea would explode.""","Blake Mycoskie had launched four other start-ups before creating TOMS .

"(CNN) -- Federal officers charged with keeping terrorists off planes are now searching their own ranks for staff who told CNN that few flights were protected by air marshals. Iraq war veteran Jeff Denning says a TSA investigator called him trying to find out if he spoke to CNN. The Transportation Security Administration rejected as a ""myth"" CNN's report that less than 1 percent of the nation's daily flights carry armed federal air marshals. Now the agency is conducting an investigation into who talked to CNN and who encouraged other agents to do the same. A spokesman for the TSA confirmed the investigation. Spokesman Christopher White said a TSA investigator is looking into the ""possible unauthorized release of sensitive and classified information to the news media by covered parties."" ""As part of this ongoing investigation, several individuals, both current and former employees, have been contacted as is typical in any investigation,"" he said in an e-mail to CNN. CNN spoke to more than a dozen current and former air marshals, pilots and federal law enforcement officials for the report, which aired in March on ""Anderson Cooper 360º."" Repeatedly, the sources told CNN that as few as 280 of an estimated 28,000 daily flights had armed federal air marshals aboard. That amounts to less than 1 percent. ""That number is absolutely wrong,"" said Kip Hawley, the head of the agency. He was speaking earlier this year before Congress, which held hearings into the Federal Air Marshal Service (FAMS) in the wake of CNN's reporting. CNN learned of the TSA investigation from a former federal air marshal and Iraq war veteran, Jeff Denning. He was not connected to the original story. Denning said he was called by TSA investigator Greg Neiderer a few days after he came back from the front lines of Iraq. Denning said Neiderer grilled him on an e-mail he received on his personal account while he was in Iraq. The e-mail discussed plans to expose corruption in the air marshal service. The e-mail encouraged recipients to contact CNN correspondent Drew Griffin if they had information about the hiring of airport screeners as air marshals, the elimination of mandatory psychiatric tests for new hires and managers lying to Congress.  Read the e-mail » . CNN only recently received a copy of the e-mail. CNN did not have it when the report aired in March. Denning said he forwarded the e-mail to current and former air marshals. Denning said Neiderer wanted to know who sent him the e-mail. Nothing in the e-mail contained sensitive security information, Denning said, nor did it encourage anyone to disclose information that could endanger the public. ""I was petrified,"" Denning said of Neiderer's phone call, explaining how he contacted CNN full of dismay that the TSA was harassing him and his family to find out which of his former colleagues had talked to the media. ""In Iraq, there were a lot of dangerous things, but never have I been so scared [as] when the federal government called me on my home phone and said I want to know about your personal e-mail account and what you have been sending."" TSA's Hawley refused repeated requests to be interviewed by CNN. Neiderer did not return repeated calls or e-mails. In an e-mail, TSA spokesman White confirmed Neiderer's involvement, but denied that the TSA or the Federal Air Marshal Service had accessed anyone's private e-mail accounts, via subpoena or otherwise. However, he added that ""all e-mails sent to government employees on a government system are always eligible to be read and reviewed as is outlined on every computer in TSA, including the FAMS."" White did not say how much the investigation is costing taxpayers or how long it would last. With a few phone calls, CNN was able to find the author of the original e-mail. The author is an air marshal who asked that his identity be concealed for fear of retribution by the TSA. The marshal said he sent the e-mail because for six years, his colleagues have been trying to alert Congress about continuing problems in the air marshal service. Many have left, he said, because of low morale and complaints about management. A May 2008 report from the Department of Homeland Security Office of the Inspector General said that the agency ""currently experiences a 17% voluntary attrition rate and low employee morale."" ""Congress doesn't want to hear it,"" the marshal said. ""They stick their heads in the sand. We tell them about the corruption. We give them examples and proof and I think they are scared of what they see. And they don't want to deal with it."" The marshal said he had done nothing wrong by sending an e-mail. ""The only thing in my e-mail was my telling these other air marshals that CNN was willing to expose the corruption in the federal air marshal services and Mr. Griffin's e-mail address,"" he said. ""That's not sensitive security information. That's freedom of speech."" He said he sent another e-mail urging air marshals to contact members of Congress investigating the air marshal service. Meanwhile, the air marshal service is undergoing a management change. Shortly after CNN aired its first report, director Dana Brown announced plans to retire. He has since decided to stay with the air marshals in a newly created position of Integrity Officer. His successor is Robert Bray, current deputy director, who, like Brown and Neiderer, is a former Secret Service employee. According to the TSA, Brown's job is to ensure that ""disciplinary measures and other personnel actions are administered uniformly throughout the organization."" Former air marshal Denning said he thinks the TSA should spend its time tracking down terrorists instead of former employees' e-mails. ""If they want to tap into someone's personal e-mail because they were going to destroy the Pentagon or kill the president, I could see reasons for contacting someone,"" Denning said. ""But they're contacting me on my personal e-mail that I apparently forwarded to someone else's personal e-mail account. It's outlandish.""

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- Soldiers, insurgents and bandits routinely target civilians in Somalia for rape, robbery and murder, according to an Amnesty International report released Tuesday. Somalis run through the streets of the capital, Mogadishu, on Monday to protest food prices. The report said civilians are caught in the middle as Ethiopian soldiers and troops of Somalia's Transitional Federal Government battle remnants of the Islamic Courts Union, which the Ethiopian forces ousted in 2006. Amnesty International, which included in its report interviews with dozens of refugees who recently fled the East African country, called for international help and pressure to end the violence. ""It was like living in constant fear, fear of RPGs [rocket-propelled grenades] that can reach you,"" said Aasha, a young female refugee quoted in the report. ""If you go out on the street someone could rape you. But someone could also come in your door and slaughter you."" Read full report -- (PDF) Aasha said she fled the lawless capital of Mogadishu after her brother was killed when Ethiopian soldiers retaliated for a militia attack. Amnesty International said it found ""established patterns of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law including rape and unlawful killings of civilians in neighborhoods of Mogadishu by all parties to the conflict in Somalia, most notably TFG and Ethiopian forces."" The report cited an estimate that 6,000 Somali civilians were killed in 2007 and that 600,000 have become refugees because of the violence. ""Among the most common violations reported were an increased incidence of gang rape, and scores of reports of a type of killing locally referred to as 'slaughtering,' or 'killing like goats,' "" the report said. One December slaying was described ""where a young child's throat was slit by Ethiopian soldiers in front of the child's mother."" ""I saw girls get raped in my neighborhood and on the streets,"" said Butaaco, 30, a refugee from Mogadishu. ""I saw people get slaughtered. I saw people killed in their houses, their bodies rotting for days.""  Watch what violence is doing to Somali children and families » . Amnesty International said that in many cases when Somali government and Ethiopian forces couldn't find militia collaborators, then ""they beat, arrested or killed someone other than the person they were looking for."" ""In many other cases, TFG and Ethiopian forces would sweep entire streets, moving door to door, beating or shooting those they found in areas from which armed groups were believed to have launched attacks, or areas presumed to be armed group strongholds,"" the report said. Civilians are ""frequently caught in indiscriminate fire"" from Ethiopian snipers on top of buildings, it said. Qamaan, 44, said a woman he knew was shot to death by Ethiopian soldiers while she sold gas at a market. ""She called her family on her cell phone ... as she lay in the street, but no one could come close enough to rescue her because of snipers,"" Qamaan said. Amnesty International documented an increase in attacks by Ethiopian soldiers against civilians in November and December. These followed an incident in which bodies of Ethiopian soldiers were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu. Guled, 32, a refugee from Mogadishu, described seeing neighbors with their throats slit and bodies left in the street. ""Some had their testicles cut off,"" Guled said. He said a newlywed woman who lived next door to him was raped by more than 20 Ethiopians. ""Our main problem is communication,"" Guled said. ""The men do not speak our language; they start screaming and we can't tell them we don't understand."" Hibo, 52, a mother of 11, said Ethiopian soldiers killed her husband and two sons after they searched the older man, found some money and took it. She said she saw the killings from a window. ""One of my sons cried out, 'Don't take this, we don't have anything else at home for my mother and the other children.' One of the soldiers beat my son, and my husband responded by trying to protect him. The soldier beat my husband, and my other son grabbed onto him. The soldier took out his gun and shot him."" Amnesty International said that armed groups, including remnants of the Islamic Courts Union, act ""as bandits, perpetrating raids, robberies and other abuses against civilians, including rape and other forms of sexual violence."" Refugees said the militias are not usually visible, but they launch hit-and-run attacks on the Somali government and Ethiopian forces. Those forces respond with artillery fire, frequently destroying entire neighborhoods. The crisis is compounded by threats and attacks on human rights workers and journalists who try to stop the violence, the report said. ""I couldn't tell who to beware of and careful of -- the Ethiopians, the TFG or local national resistance groups,"" said Bilan, a journalist with Radio Simba. Even those who flee Mogadishu for temporary refugee camps in Kenya or Somaliland -- a self-declared independent region to the north -- are targeted by bandits and soldiers, the report said. ""On the road from Mogadishu, there are robbers who come and take your money or just fire directly at the buses,"" one female refugee said. ""Sometimes there are roadblocks where they stop and ask you for money. If you don't stop, they will kill you."" Haboon, 56, said Ethiopian soldiers abused people with whom she was fleeing the country. ""If the girls were pretty, they would try their best to take them from you,"" Haboon said. ""I was trying my best to cover the girls so they wouldn't see them."" The report said refugees arrive at temporary settlements with nothing but the clothes they wear, robbed of all money and possessions. Amnesty International said the recognized government of Somalia ""bears the primary responsibility for protecting the human rights of the Somali people. ""However, the Ethiopian military, which is taking a leading role in backing the TFG, also bears responsibility,"" it said. ""Attacks on civilians by all parties must stop immediately,"" the report said. ""Also, the international community must bear its own responsibility for not putting consistent pressure on the TFG or the Ethiopian government to stop their armed forces from committing egregious human rights violations."" Zembkun Tekle, a spokesman for Ethiopia's minister of information, said, ""We are not confident on the report that Amnesty is giving. ""They should be careful and need to see the facts on the ground,"" Tekle said. ""They should make every effort to include [the] other side of the story."" He said, ""Our forces are not known for robbery and other problems that are facing the Somali people. ""They are known for their discipline and [known] for their good relations to the public."" Amnesty International called for the United Nations to beef up its Political Office for Somalia. It also urged the African Union's mission in Somalia be given a mandate ""to protect civilians and include a strong human rights component with the capacity to investigate human rights violations.""

"TITUSVILLE, Florida (CNN) -- It's shortly after 5 a.m. when the phone rings, and on the line is a clearly anxious and worried parent. Sierra Journey Factor, 8, has a muscular disease that her mom, Shaylene Akery, hopes can be treated in China. ""Sierra is having a lot of problems tonight,"" Shaylene Akery tells a CNN producer. ""We have to take her to the hospital, but we still want to talk to you about her trip to China."" Her daughter, Sierra Journey Factor, is 8 years old and has a terminal disease called Type 2 spinal muscular atrophy, a genetic disorder that affects parts of the nervous system that control voluntary muscle movement. In addition, she has a restrictive lung disease and a kidney disorder. She has used a wheelchair since infancy. Sierra's mother, her stepfather and her biological father, A.J. Factor, all know that Sierra is seriously ill. On the morning we met them, Sierra was treated at two hospitals before she was stabilized. But the family is convinced of their next step -- taking Sierra on an arduous trip to southern China, where they believe the little girl will be injected six times with stem cells during a 34-day stay. It's the kind of treatment not yet approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration. Sierra's treatment will cost $26,500, which does not include the cost of travel and living for the extended family. Those costs would mean an additional $25,000, according to Akery.  Watch more on the quest for a stem-cell cure » . ""We are really walking into this blindfolded,"" Akery said. ""It's scary, but everybody says it's so nice over there."" The family says it got most of its information from a Web site called China Stem Cell News, at stemcellschina.com, which boasts of dozens of anecdotal testimonials from loved ones who say their children or family members showed improvement after the stem cell treatments. The site offers no scientific evidence and no means of making contact except through a Web form. CNN used the form, but as of yet has received no reply. Stem cell therapy is routinely performed at clinics in China. When CNN correspondent John Vause reported on one stem cell therapy clinic near Beijing in December, the clinic refused to release its records or put its cases forward for peer review. The International Society of Stem Cell Researchers and the FDA discourage Americans from traveling overseas for stem cell therapy. But clinics are operating worldwide -- many in China, and several in Russia, Latin America and Mexico. ""We do not encourage patients to seek therapies overseas that are not FDA-approved in the U.S.,"" an agency spokesman said in an e-mail to CNN, ""as the products or therapies have not undergone the agency's rigorous review."" The ALS Association is one group especially concerned. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a terminal illness also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, named after the baseball legend who most famously suffered from it. There are no accurate numbers, but ALS Association officials say dozens, perhaps hundreds, of ALS patients have traveled to China and other locations seeking relief. CNN asked Dr. Lucie Bruijn, the senior vice president for research and development for the ALS Association, whether stem cells offer meaningful treatment for ALS. ""No, it's definitely not true,"" she said. ""Certainly you hope that the answer from an ALS clinician who is knowledgeable ... [will be], 'There are things that are promising but we don't have anything to offer you now.' "" That statement is at odds with promises posted on a relatively new Web site run by an 80-year-old Florida doctor named Burton Feinerman, who says he's been conducting stem cell therapy for three years. His site, Stem Cell Regen Med, at stemcellregenmed.com, says it can offer treatment for a long list of life-threatening diseases, including ALS, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, cancer, brain damage and lung illnesses. It is not the program to which Akery intends to take her daughter. Feinerman says he and a partner work out of a clinic in Lima, Peru, where they offer stem cell therapy injections at a cost of $8,000 to $25,000. ""Isn't what you're doing experimenting on people?"" CNN asked Feinerman. ""Yes,"" he said, ""and people are fully aware."" ""And charging them large amounts of money to do these experiments?"" asked CNN. ""The amount of money is large,"" Feinerman replied. ""But it basically is pretty close to my cost."" Feinerman, who said he was a cosmetic dermatologist in Hawaii before moving to Florida, also said he is no expert on stem cells. ""I have trained at the Mayo Clinic and have been practicing medicine for over 50 years,"" he said. ""But you never trained in stem cell research?"" asked CNN. ""No,"" Feinerman replied. ""But you've gone to some conferences, self-taught, right?"" CNN asked. ""Right. That's true."" ""And now you're basically taking people from the United States to other countries because the procedures can't legally be done here?"" ""That is right,"" Feinerman said. ""But I am the organizer, so to speak. I am the person who does an enormous amount of reading and visiting. Putting protocols together that appear to work in other countries."" Feinerman said his expertise comes from extensive reading on the subject, and attending international conferences on stem cell research, sometimes as many as six a year. He spoke to CNN just hours before, he said, he was heading to Peru to treat three more Americans with life-threatening illnesses. In a statement issued after the interview, Feinerman said, ""We are not selling snake oil, but our scientific approach to diseases that are not available in the USA."" Meanwhile, at the Arnold Palmer Children's Hospital in Orlando, Florida, the family of 8-year-old Sierra Journey Factor were more convinced than ever to take their child across the world to China for a treatment they conceded is not a guarantee of a cure. The science director of the Fight SMA organization, Chris Lorson, told CNN there is no proven stem-cell treatment for the disease. ""If you go there and nothing happens, will you still think it was worth it?"" CNN asked Akery. ""Yes,"" Akery said. ""Because we can still say we tried.""","Stem cell injections are offered at various clinics worldwide .

"(CNN) -- Around 204,000 people have fled their homes in the Somali capital of Mogadishu as a result of a militant offensive against government forces, the U.N. refugee agency said on Tuesday. Islamist fighters exchange gunfire with government forces in Mogadishu on July 3. The eight-week long push by Al-Shaabab and Hisb-ul-Islam militias has prompted what the agency calls ""the biggest exodus from the troubled Somali capital since the Ethiopian intervention in 2007."" ""The escalating conflict in Mogadishu is having a devastating impact on the city's population causing enormous suffering and massive displacement,"" the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said. The agency said its local partners in the capital reported that fighting over the past week ""has killed some 105 people and injured 382."" ""Neighborhoods affected by the fighting include Kaaran, Shibis, Shangaani and Boondheere in North Mogadishu. These areas have hitherto been islands of peace, escaping much of the conflict and destruction. Many residents are fleeing their homes for the first time since the start of the Somali civil war in 1991,"" the agency said. The agency said the number of internally displaced people in Somalia amounts to more than 1.2 million people. There has been growing concern that Somalia, in the Horn of Africa, could be the next base for al Qaeda as U.S. forces pound their positions in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Last month, a U.S. State Department spokesman said the United States is providing weapons and ammunition to Somalia's transitional government as it fights al Qaeda-linked Islamist militants. CIA Director Leon Panetta recently said that the intelligence agency is keeping tabs on the region as a possible destination for fleeing al Qaeda operatives. ""Our concern right now is that likely safe havens are areas in the Horn of Africa, like Somalia and Yemen, that are countries that because of their political status can be attractive to al Qaeda in order to operate there,"" Panetta said earlier this month. Al-Shaabab, also known as the Mujahideen Youth Movement, was officially designated as a terrorist organization by the United States in March 2008. It is waging a war against Somalia's government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law.","Eight-week long push by Al-Shaabab and Hisb-ul-Islam militias prompted exodus .

"(CNN) -- These days, it's impossible to overstate the popularity of games for social networks, with Facebook titles like ""Pet Society,"" ""Happy Aquarium"" and ""Zoo World"" all boasting massive followings. To cynics, popular games such as Zygna's new ""FrontierVille,"" which recently racked up 20 million users in just 36 days, may seem like simple carbon copies of earlier hits -- most obviously ""FarmVille,"" which once touted four times as many players. Not so, argue industry insiders, who maintain that imitation is both the sincerest, and most sensible, form of flattery available to today's game designers. ""Zynga certainly uses a formula for its games,"" says Libe Goad, editor-in-chief of Games.com. ""'FrontierVille' takes elements of 'FarmVille,' including harvesting and helping neighbors, and then adds elements from more traditional strategy games to it. Since [the company] is notoriously metrics-driven, I predict that they will stick to this formula... It seems to be working well for them."" It's a sentiment clearly echoed by Wade Tinney, CEO of Large Animal Games, makers of popular Facebook, MySpace and Bebo outings like ""Bumper Stars"" and ""Lucky Strike Lanes."" ""Certainly there are some play mechanics that reappear in 'FrontierVille,' but I'd expect that from any game developer,"" he says. Arguing that ""FarmVille"" was ""basically a rip-off"" of earlier title ""myFarm"" anyway, Tinney counters that ""FrontierVille"" is ""a step in the right direction"" for the company because it offers a more original take on an existing formula. The idea of recycling core game mechanics isn't really a big deal -- witness the number of military-themed shooters on the market for PCs and consoles, Tinney said. ""If something works well, why not keep using it?"" ""Games in general, including board games, sports, video games and more, tend to use successful mechanics over and over again, just like movies have formulaic plots,"" concurs Brenda Brathwaite, creative director at lolapps.com. ""It reduces risk and takes advantage of existing player knowledge."" But Brathwaite believes the practice of recycling game concepts, while appealing to profit-minded companies, also has the potential to backfire. ""In casual games, players not only want, but need to have some kind of idea how to play a game when they first [try] them, and these common paradigms provide context,"" she says. ""The key, however, is to innovate on them or introduce a completely new mechanic. The potential downside is that players can get tired of the same old patterns over and over again."" In FarmVille, players manage a virtual farm by planting and harvesting virtual crops and raising livestock. FrontierVille transplants this concept to the wilderness, where players fell trees, clear brush, find arrowheads and build a Western-themed homestead. Some outspoken critics say that enough is enough already. ""There will always be some players who want more of the same,"" says Joel Brodie, founder of casual game reviews site Gamezebo.com. ""I think the majority of game players online, however, have a short attention span and always want to be challenged."" ""Some companies are releasing very innovative games,"" he says. ""Examples include 'Lucky Train' (create and send trains between friends), 'Office Wars' (create an army of office workers and fight away) and 'Growing Diary' (a chance to relive your life as a 5- year-old). ""I think the bigger question is whether companies that take such risks are rewarded with success on Facebook. 'FrontierVille' in one hour is making more money and driving more game traffic than all the innovative games combined."" For those seeking the next big thing, experts agree that social games are just scratching the surface when it comes to pushing creative boundaries. ""Social game makers are just getting warmed up,"" says Games.com's Goad, citing Playfish and its swashbuckling title ""Pirates Ahoy!"" as a prime example. ""Nobody's run out of ideas,"" agrees Brathwaite. ""In fact, I think we're seeing more diversity of topics in social games than we're seeing in the traditional game market. Because of [social gaming's] nature and shorter development cycles, though, we're also more able to see the 'me too' clones way faster.""","Zygna's ""FrontierVille"" recently racked up 20 million users in 36 days .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Flashback to 1984: As a child, I am glued to my family's black-and-white television set for our daily dose of evening entertainment and news on India's national broadcaster. India holds its first rocket launch from a fishing village in southern India on November 21, 1963. But this is no ordinary newscast: Prime Minister Indira Gandhi is speaking via videolink with astronaut Rakesh Sharma, who is aboard a space station. Indian pride soared as Squadron Leader Sharma, an Indian Air Force pilot, became the first in the nation to explore the celestial realm, part of a joint mission with what was then the Soviet Union. I don't remember what show it was, but it etched India's ""astronomical feat"" in the minds of those who watched it, including a 10-year-old like me. But the Indian connection to space was much older than that milestone. In the country's space calendar, November 21, 1963, is a key date: It marks the first rocket launch from a fishing village in southern India. Nike-Apache, a two-stage sounding rocket imported from the United States, took off that day from Thumba, a site that eventually became a favorite location for similar experiments by international scientists. So far, there have been some 2,200 sounding-rocket launches from that facility, according to the Vikram Sarabhai Space Center. But the South Asian nation's space program has been far more expansive -- the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) has more than 60 events that it lists as ""milestones"" since 1962-63, which includes the successful use of polar and geosynchronous satellite launch vehicles.  See India's space odyssey in photos » . Fast forward to 2008: The country launches its first unmanned mission to the Moon in what is being seen as the 21st-Century, Asian version of the space race between the United States and the USSR -- but this time the two nations involved are India and China. In September of that same year, a Chinese astronaut took a spacewalk, his country's first. A month later, India sent Chandrayaan-1 -- Chandrayaan means ""moon craft"" in Sanskrit -- on a two-year mission to take high-resolution, three-dimensional images of the lunar surface, especially the permanently-shadowed polar regions. The craft, carrying payloads from the United States, the European Union and Bulgaria, will search for evidence of water or ice and attempt to identify the chemical composition of certain lunar rocks. Nonetheless, India maintains competition does not drive its space program. Vikram Sarabhai, seen as the father of India's space program, made this case for government funding of the program in the 1960s: . ""We do not have the fantasy of competing with the economically-advanced nations in the exploration of the Moon or the planets or manned space-flight,"" Sarabhai said, according to ISRO's Website. ""But we are convinced that if we are to play a meaningful role nationally, and in the community of nations, we must be second to none in the application of advanced technologies to the real problems of man and society,"" said Sarabhai, in what the agency described as a ""vision"" for India's space endeavors.   Earlier this year, the Indian government increased the federal budget for space research to around $1 billion from some $700 million, ISRO spokesman S. Satish told CNN, as scientists propose to send astronauts into space by 2015 on solely Indian missions. ISRO was also studying the feasibility of sending a manned craft to the Moon by 2020, Satish said, adding that plans for unmanned Mars missions in the coming years have not been finalized. The space agency dropped a TV-sized probe on the Moon last November that it said sent sufficient signals to the mother craft before a crash landing. But the country's space ambitions are not limited to public research endeavors, Satish said. ""We have just entered the commercial satellite launch market,"" he said, including what ISRO noted is now the world's largest constellation of remote-sensing satellites. These satellites, according to the Vikram Sarabhai Space Center, capture images of the Earth that are used in a range of applications -- agriculture, water resources, urban development, mineral prospecting, environment, forestry, drought and flood forecasting, ocean resources and disaster management. Another major system, or INSAT, is used for communication, television and meteorology. ""We have mastered the space technology in these 40 years. We have already sent an unmanned mission to the Moon and now we look forward to sending a manned one there,"" Satish said.","India made its first rocket launch on November 21, 1963 .

"(CNN) -- Taliban official Hakeemullah Mehsud has been selected the new head of the Pakistani Taliban, a local Taliban commander in Pakistan's federally administered tribal areas told CNN Saturday. Baitullah Mehsud, right, former leader of the Pakistani Taliban, and a bodyguard in Pakistan, in 2004. Mehsud was selected Friday by a 42-member Taliban council, or shura, according to Taliban commander Qari Haris. Another Taliban official -- Maulvi Faqir Mohammad -- had been tapped as Mehsud's deputy, Haris said. Mohammad had named himself acting head of the Pakistani Taliban on Wednesday. A third official -- Hazem Tariq -- was named the group's new spokesman, Haris added. The announced selection underscored the contention by Pakistani and U.S. officials that the group's former leader, Baitullah Mehsud, was killed in an August 5 drone attack in Waziristan. Both Mohammad and Haris claim Mehsud is alive but ill. Pakistani officials announced Tuesday that two top figures in the Pakistani Taliban had been arrested. Saif Ullah is believed to have been Baitullah Mehsud's right-hand man, and Maulvi Umar is the well-known spokesman for the militant group. Umar recently declared that Mehsud had not been killed in a drone strike on his father-in-law's house, but a senior Pakistani official said that Umar had admitted under questioning that Mehsud was dead. The top U.S. envoy to the region, Richard Holbrooke, told CNN that the Pakistani Taliban had not confirmed Mehsud's death because of an ongoing power struggle over his successor. Journalists Janullah Hamizshada and Nazar ur Islam contributed to this report.","Taliban official Hakeemullah Mehsud was selected Friday by 42-member panel .

"(CNN) -- As the violence in the Central African Republic reaches unprecedented levels, aid organizations say the number of internally displaced people edges toward a million, further hampering humanitarian relief efforts. The nearly 935,000 displaced people are hiding in bushes and seeking refuge with host families, and churches and schools have been turned in to makeshift shelters. More than half the population of the capital city of Bangui has been displaced, and nearly 60% of them are displaced children, according to the latest report from UNHCR, the United Nations' refugee agency. Since March, violence has gripped the Central African Republic, or CAR. Aboubakar Daoud, 33, has spent the last 15 years of his life as a shopkeeper in the country. He says life was very good, his business was thriving and everyone was living in peace. But all of that is now just a memory. ""The situation is very precarious for Muslims and particularly for Chadians, even for those who got married with the Chadians,"" he said. After the predominantly Muslim-backed Seleka militia and other rebel groups from the marginalized northeast seized Bangui, one of the Seleka leaders, Michel Djotodia, overthrew President Francois Bozize, who fled to Cameroon, creating a political power struggle. Under Djotodia's interim presidency and transitional governance, Human Rights Watch has reported details of the Seleka's deliberate killing of civilians, including women, children and the elderly. The rights group also reported in recent weeks that violence and insecurity in the Central African Republic have taken on an alarming sectarian dimension. Backlash set in when Djotodia officially disbanded the Seleka and, according to rights groups, thousands of Seleka rebels kept their arms and formed their own vigilante group known as the ""ex-Seleka."" That group has since been integrated into a new ""national army."" Human Rights Watch says command and control of the ex-Seleka remain questionable as the group continues to commit abuses in the Central African Republic. All the while, the anti-balaka -- a predominantly Christian armed group created by then-President Bozize to fight banditry -- continues to attack Muslim civilians in response to ex-Seleka abuses. Residents say the violence between the Muslim Seleka militias and the retaliating Christian groups has wreaked havoc in cities across the Central African Republic. ""For days and nights on end, the men in my town did not sleep so we could secure the area from anti-balaka. They would come anytime to attack Chadians in the area,"" Daoud said. In December, 1,000 men were killed over a two-day period, according to Amnesty International. As a protective response, France has sent 1,600 troops under a United Nations mandate into the Central African Republic to assist African troops, but the violence continues. Children beheaded as violence grows in Central African Republic . 'Unprecedented levels of violence against children' ""I was born in CAR and started to do commerce with my parents at an early age. The good moments were in the past and have ended. We were living in peace as brothers and sisters,"" said businesswoman Djemila Abdoulaye, 39. ""The worst moment was when my 21-year-old son went out to look for some provisions, and he got shot on Christmas Eve,"" she said, holding back her tears. ""At the same time, his uncle got shot trying to protect him. I have never seen them or their bodies again."" UNICEF, the United Nations children's aid agency, has verified the killings of at least 16 children, and injuries among 60, since the outbreak of communal violence in Bangui on December 5. The agency says at least two children were beheaded at the end of December, and one of them mutilated, further stating that attacks in the CAR against children have sunk to a ""vicious new low."" ""We are witnessing unprecedented levels of violence against children. More and more children are being recruited into armed groups, and they are also being directly targeted in atrocious revenge attacks,"" said Souleymane Diabate, a country representative for UNICEF. ""Targeted attacks against children are a violation of international humanitarian and human rights law and must stop immediately. Concrete action is needed now to prevent violence against children,"" Diabate said. The Central African Republic, which is north of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is one of the six African countries that border Chad. The International Organization for Migrants, or IOM, estimates there could be tens of thousands of migrants in the CAR, with most originating from the neighboring region, including Cameroon, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Niger, Nigeria and Sudan. Also, Chadians are among the migrants in the CAR who are at the highest risk, the IOM says. Group: Nearly 1,000 killed over 2 days . 'Largest evacuation effort' since 2011 . ""This is the largest evacuation effort we have seen since the war in Libya in 2011,"" said Dr. Qasim Sufi, the IOM chief of mission who's in charge of receiving Chadians arriving from the CAR. Air evacuations from the CAR to Chad are now entering the third week, and the IOM says the number of Chadian migrants evacuated is increasing by the day. Since late December, the IOM estimates, more than 17,000 Chadian migrants have been returned from the CAR by air and land. ""We have a very big caseload of evacuated migrants in a short period of time, which can overstretch our capacity to assist, and we need additional financial support,"" Sufi said. The UNHCR estimates that this mission could cost $152.2 million. ""There are also hundreds of Nigerians waiting at the Nigeria Embassy in CAR to be rescued. Citizens are being taken from Bangui to Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport in Abuja, where they can unite with their family,"" said Mohammed Sani Sidi, director general of the National Emergency Agency. For weeks now, the Bangui International Airport has become a safe house for many people looking to flee the violence. The government of Chad also has sent road convoys to help evacuate migrants who were not able to make it to the airport. ""The evacuations are nice, but the situation at the airport is not well-organized because there are too many Chadians who all want to get back to Chad,"" said Abdoulaye, the businesswoman. The air evacuations alone, to date, have topped 8,500 people aboard 51 flights. The first road convoy organized by the Chadian government to evacuate stranded Chadian migrants arrived at the Chadian border village of Sido this week to help evacuate about 1,800 women and children who were living in very desperate conditions. The IOM also estimates that 4,000 additional migrants have returned to Chad on their own through the Gore and Sido border crossing points. ""Many of the evacuees are in urgent need of basic humanitarian assistance, including food, water, medical attention,"" Sufi said. ""Once returning to Chad, these migrants are really traumatized psychologically and need further help, time and assistance reacclimating to their new surroundings."" At least five migrants have died since the evacuations began Friday, according to Sufi. As for Daoud, he looks across the border to find a new way of life. ""I think, it will be better to go to the village and be a farmer,"" he said. Others, such as Abdoulaye, are leaving everything behind. ""I will only take my life back to Chad. I'm happy to still be alive,"" she said. Fears of genocide: 10 things to know about the CAF .

"(CNN) -- A Massachusetts college has modified a controversial security policy after criticism it infringed on the religious rights of students, a school official said Friday. The policy originally banned any head covering that obscured the student's face while engaged in student activities. The Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences e-mailed students about the initial changes this week, saying, ""Any head covering that obscures a student's face may not be worn, either on campus or at clinical sites, except when required for medical reasons."" School officials said the policy was intended to ensure that all students would be identifiable ""for reasons of safety and security."" But on Thursday, the policy was changed to include an exception ""for medical and/or religious reasons."" The original policy had prompted questions and concerns among Muslim students and organizations, particularly because it meant Muslim women at the college could no longer wear the niqab, or face veil. The college -- with campuses in Boston and Worcester, Massachusetts, as well as Manchester, New Hampshire -- stated that the initial modification was ""based on a constructive dialogue with our extended community, and an intensive review of safety and security measures with advisors."" College spokesman Michael Ratty said, ""We will achieve our objective of campus security while allowing for a medical and/or religious accommodation. As always, our primary concern is the security and safety of all our students, faculty and staff."" Ratty stressed that Muslims were involved in the original policy decision saying, ""Prior to implementation, the college discussed it with several officials within the Muslim community."" Muslim students had mixed reactions to the original ban. Aisha Bajwa, president of the Muslim Students Association at the college, called the unmodified policy ""unjustified and unconstitutional."" Bajwa, who does not wear the niqab, said that having to wear student IDs at all times keeps students safe. Ibrahim Hooper, communications director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, thinks the policy targeted Muslim students and filed a third-party complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Writing to the commission, the Council invoked Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employers from discriminating based on religion. Hooper acknowledged that the college's policy focuses on students but said it will inevitably target Muslim employees in the future. After the complaint, George Humphrey, the vice president for College Relations, e-mailed Hooper, announcing the new policy. ""We have reviewed our ID policy and made an accommodation for religious reasons,"" the e-mail said. ""Thank you for your input on this matter."" Hooper then stated, ""We are pleased that the religious rights of all students and staff will now be protected. This is a victory for religious freedom and tolerance."" Ratty said, ""The complaint was not the sole reason for the reversal but rather an ongoing discussion this week with our community."" Daniel Pipes, director of the Middle East Forum, supported the original policy. Though Pipes acknowledged the larger cultural debate, he said the college is focusing on security. ""I have documented dozens and dozens of cases about criminality and terrorism that have been abetted by burqas and niqabs,"" he said. ""It is sensible to ban these, and there are a number of these bans in institutions such as banks or jewelry stores."" With increasing concern about terrorist attacks, religious practices will have to be weighed against security, Pipes said. ""In Turkey, the hijab has been banned from government offices, so this is not something that is just an American concern,"" he added.","School banned head coverings that obscured student's face during student activities .

"(CNN) -- European trade unionists descended on Brussels, Belgium, Wednesday in the tens of thousands, determined to both vent their anger at austerity measures and to tell European governments to ""put people first."" Belgian police told CNN that around 80,000 people turned out for the demonstration in the capitol, which was organized by the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC). It represents the interests of trade unions from 36 European countries and claims 60 million members. ETUC's general secretary, John Monks, had said up to 100,000 people were expected. Even so, the crowd was sufficient to pack streets in central and downtown Brussels. The atmosphere had the vibrant feel of a carnival, with trade unionists in brightly colored T-shirts and huge balloons among the crowd, only the T-shirts and balloons bore slogans advocating the preservation of workers' rights. Demonstrators wanted to tell European governments and banks to put the needs of people ahead of balanced budgets, according to the ETUC website. Marchers were on the streets to express their concern about both the economic and social situation, and to assert their belief that austerity measures designed to balance budgets will put more people at risk. One man told CNN, ""It's not time to forget the people. It's not time to forget the workers. It's time to hear what's happening in the street."" The crowd in Brussels marched from the Midi Railway station to Cinquantenaire Arch. Then they packed into Jubilee Park to hear speeches from union representatives. Some of those representatives later met with European Union President Jose Manuel Barroso. Explainer: Why Europe is protesting . Rallies were also planned in Portugal, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Serbia, Romania, Poland, Ireland and France. Those demonstrations coincided with a general strike in Spain. Lines were long at train stations and metro services in Madrid. Fewer trains and buses were in service and travel was disrupted both in the capitol and in other big cities across the country. Spanish unions said the strike was a big success. They said there was 70 percent support among their workers. They also said there was 17 percent less electrical consumption Wednesday than there is on a normal weekday. Thousands turned out to for marches to support the strike, as well. In Madrid, demonstrators packed streets shoulder-to-shoulder, waving red flags, chanting and blowing whistles. There were scattered confrontations between police and picketers reported during the day, especially in Barcelona. Some demonstrators were injured and police cars burned there. CNN affiliate CNN+ said a protester was hit by a bus and injured in the city. But overall, authorities say the day was peaceful . Spanish unions to called the strike because they believe planned government reforms will make it easier for companies to lay off workers, especially higher-paid ones. The government, however, says the changes will ease Spain's deficit and recession and make for a more competitive economy. Spain already has 20 percent unemployment -- the highest among countries using the euro currency -- and many see the reforms as inevitable and necessary.

"(CNN) -- Move over Pocahontas and Mulan. Sofia estÃ¡ aquÃ­. Disney's first Latina princess, featured in the movie ""Sofia the First: Once Upon A Princess,"" has received backlash as well as support from media outlets, especially the Latino community. Is Disney's new princess a milestone for Latinos or a culturally irrelevant character? Disney's spokeswoman provided a recent statement to CNN to help clarify what exactly makes ""Princess Sofia"" Latina: . ""The range of characters in 'Sofia the First' -- and the actors who play them -- are a reflection of Disney's commitment to diverse, multicultural and inclusive storytelling, and the wonderful early reaction to 'Sofia' affirms that commitment. In the story, Sofia's mother, Queen Miranda, was born in a fictitious land, Galdiz, a place with Latin influences. Miranda met Sofia's father, Birk Balthazar, who hailed from the kingdom of Freezenberg, and together they moved to Enchancia, where Sofia was born."" ""Sofia the First"" is a television movie and series set to debut November 18 on the Disney Channel and Disney Junior, aimed at children ages 2-7. Sofia is a regular little girl whose life changes when her mother marries the king. Ariel Winter from ""Modern Family"" will voice Sofia and Sara Ramirez from ""Grey's Anatomy"" will voice Queen Miranda. When news first hit in December 2011 that Disney was going to introduce its new and much younger princess, there was no mention of Sofia's Latina background, let alone that her mother was from ""a place with Latin influences,"" until this week. Yet this week, Disney announced that Sofia was indeed Latina. As reported by Entertainment Weekly, a blogger on a press tour of the movie's production offices asked why Sofia's mother, Miranda, had a darker complexion than the other characters. That led to the big reveal: ""She is Latina,"" said Jamie Mitchell, executive producer. According the the vice president of Disney Junior original programming, ""We never actually call it out."" ""It's sort of a matter-of-fact situation rather than an overt thing."" However, this isn't the first time there is controversy surrounding one of Disney's princesses. In 2009, ""The Princess and the Frog"" received criticism from parents and the media for being set in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, its voodoo references and Disney's first African-American princess, Tiana, falling in love with a Caucasian prince. Most agree Princess Tiana was a step in the right direction, but many said there was still work to be done. Some Latinos applauded Disney's new milestone and welcomed her with open arms on Twitter stating, ""#Disney comes out with its first ""#Latina Princess."" Its about time. It is 2012. #Hispanics"" and ""#Disney finally comes out with a #Latina princess"" Some criticized what they saw as a lack of cultural signifiers or ethnic identity in the Sofia character. ""If Disney were truly to finally step out and directly cater to the Latino community that has been crying out for decades for a Latina princess to represent our girls,"" said Ana Flores, blogger for Spanglishbaby, ""She would be as Latina as Tiana is black or as Pocahontas is Indian-American."" Alex Nogales, president and CEO for the National Hispanic Media Coalition, a nonprofit organization that promotes Latino equality in the entertainment industry, believes the Latino community needs more heroes right now that are very identifiable. ""Latinos are taking the blame for everything that is wrong with America. This is not a time to pussyfoot around. If you're going to promote this to the public, and Latinos in particular, do us a favor and make it a real Latina.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Andrew Dice Clay, one of the hottest and most controversial comedians two decades ago, sits on his front porch late at night, plotting his comeback. ""I was almost like self-exiled from the business, you know, other than going out and making a living for myself, I wasn't really making any career moves,"" Clay says, talking with fellow comedian Tom Green. ""I was bringing up my family."" Green, who was on ""Celebrity Apprentice"" with ""Diceman"" in 2009, had his camera rolling when Clay invited CNN to hang with him a recent Friday night -- just days before his first television comedy special in 17 years airs on Showtime. ""I want to be able to make people laugh as hard as they possibly can, and I really think they need that,"" Dice said. His TV special premieres at 10 p.m. New Year's Eve ""so people can just have a couple of drinks and just laugh until it hurts."" Clay rose to iconic status in the 1980s, selling out hundreds of large arenas -- including New York's Madison Square Garden two consecutive nights in 1990. He acted in movies and performed on HBO comedy shows. But after a tough divorce, he decided to focus on raising his two sons -- Max, now 22, and Dillon, now 18 -- who lived with him. A career resurgence started last year when he landed a role in the final season of HBO's hit series ""Entourage."" He played himself with his older son, Max, also in the show. Clay's back in Las Vegas, headlining at the Hard Rock Casino in February. Woody Allen saw his five episodes on ""Entourage"" and gave him a major dramatic role in his next movie, due in theaters next summer. His co-stars include Alec Baldwin, Cate Blanchett and comedian Louis C.K. His being in a Woody Allen film is ""kinda shocking,"" Clay said. Shocking, though, is something the 55-year-old Brooklyn-born comic is known for. Critics frequently scorned him, calling his act racist, misogynist and homophobic. His jokes about gays, women and midgets are still there in his new material. ""I make no apologies for anything I did on that special, or any joke I tell because that's the thing about jokes,"" he said. ""That's all it's meant to be taken as. Whether they're clean, dirty, it's just humor. You know, it's just jokes. This society today, the politically correct, I think people are just sick of it."" Politically incorrect jokes, however, have seriously hurt comic careers in recent years. Think Michael Richards and the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles. Or Tracy Morgan and his anti-gay humor. ""Some of these comics are on like CBS or ABC, so, you know, it's the powers-that-be that turn around and go 'You've got to apologize for what you said.'"" Clay said. ""And that's just wrong because, you know, comedy is like the last art form where you can get up there and just do whatever you want. You know, like they say, you are the producer, director, writer, star. And if they take that away, you know, that's what America is, that's what we were built on, freedom."" Clay knows what it is like for a network to turn on him for his humor. MTV banned him ""for life"" after his performance on a 1989 MTV awards show. The ban was recently lifted. ""I've been getting in trouble my whole life and I really don't care what anybody thinks of what I do on stage as a comic,"" he said. ""I know there are people out there who don't even like this kind of comedy. Turn off the TV, turn the channel. Don't watch me. But I have millions of fans out there that have been waiting for this special and waiting for me to come back like this."" And Dice is back -- still with his edgy, expletive-filled humor and a cigarette as a constant prop. He chain-smokes through the front-porch conversation, but you won't hear the profanity. ""I certainly don't walk around my home or being with my family and just using profane language all the time, but on stage, it's a constant,"" he said. ""Because I'm also hammering these different points across and because a lot of it is sexual, I just use the real words."" You will see his sons on stage, though. Max, who also does stand-up, plays drums, while Dillon is on guitar on singing. They are two-thirds of a rock group called ""L.A. Rocks."" His ex-fiance -- comedian Eleanor Kerrigan -- is his opening act in the Showtime special. With Eleanor sitting on a child-size plastic chair next to him, Dice calls her, ""The greatest opening act I've ever had -- as a woman."" As he enjoys her reaction to the backhanded compliment, he throws in, ""She's a killer."" Despite their romantic history, Eleanor is a frequent visitor at his Los Angeles home. She and his wife are ""like best friends."" Sister wives, he jokes. ""When I got together with Valerie (his wife) I told her there's one woman in my life that, you know, I can't turn around and say 'I can't see you anymore,'"" he said. ""Eleanor helped me bring up my boys, you know. It's almost like she is an ex-wife, but one I get along with."" As for the smoking, Clay got some electronic cigarettes for Christmas. While he says he may rotate them into his personal routine, don't expect to see them in his hand on stage when he's reciting his infamous versions of Mother Goose nursery rhymes. For that, it's the same Dice you've seen for decades.","Dice's resurgence started last year with a role a role in HBO's ""Entourage""

"(CNN) -- Every morning before riding, Gary Stevens has to walk four miles. The walk is a necessity, the only way the 51-year-old can get his ailing knees slowly warmed up and working, capable of dealing with the demands on those damaged joints of riding some of the world's best horses at speeds of up to 45 mph. When the American first retired in 2005, he had enough money in the bank from a glittering riding career to kill any thought of a comeback. Then there was the ensuing broadcasting career, not to mention acting forays in the movie ""Seabiscuit"" and the television series ""Luck."" But he finds himself back in the saddle. ""This is middle-aged crazy,"" he says -- and without cracking a smile, all too aware of the risks being taken. One only has to watch the clip of him being trampled like a rag doll in the 2003 Arlington Million race, suffering a punctured lung and a fractured vertebra in his back, to see that. ""People retire and play golf or go fishing. This is my fishing. I never thought I'd say so at this time of my life but I'd rather be on the race track than on the golf course, and I like golf,"" says Stevens, who started racing again at the start of last year. ""And the 50s are the new 30s right? Anyway, I'm not the only old guy out there. Look, you've got Fred Couples in golf and he's doing alright."" But his return demanded sacrifices. Stevens had to shed the equivalent of 10 bags of sugar off his body and get down to a racing weight of 114 lbs (51.7 kg) in a grueling two-month training regime. In addition, his knees are damaged to the point he knows he will need surgery to replace them. ""You don't realize how good it is until it's gone,"" he told CNN, explaining his decision to retire. ""Being retired allowed me to look back and actually enjoy some of the great things that had been accomplished in my first career. I was like 'wow.' If you won a big race, you could never rest on your laurels as there was the next day, the next race. ""Then there were the injuries and always thinking and obsessing, 'When will I get back?' I realized how good it was and I asked myself, 'Can I do it again?' ""I didn't want to come back and tarnish what I'd done in the past. I wanted to come back at a high level."" Sporting comebacks don't generally tend to end well. Stevens, though, has provided a Hollywood epilogue befitting his secondary career on the silver screen. Last year, he won 69 races including the prestigious Preakness Stakes and the Breeders' Cup Classic, and he is fast approaching 5,000 career victories on American soil alone. He notched up $100 million in winnings by the age of 30, and he is now nearer the $225 million mark. There are parallels between Stevens and another giant of flat racing, Lester Piggott, who famously returned to the saddle aged 55 -- in his case after a year in prison for tax evasion. Much like Stevens, his success was almost immediate, the British rider capping his return by winning the Breeders' Cup Mile within 10 days of his return. ""It's funny,"" says Stevens, ""but no-one's actually asked me about the Lester link before. The way he rode that Breeders' Cup, arguably one of the best rides of his career, making all the right moves at the right time. So my thought was, 'If he can do it and I'm younger, then why not.' The guy was a bit of an inspiration."" Luck has also played a part in Stevens' return to the saddle. He had previously been enjoying an acting career in the Michael Mann-directed TV series ""Luck"" alongside the likes of Dustin Hoffman and Nick Nolte, but it was cut short before the second season began due to concerns over animal safety. ""If that hadn't been axed, I'm not sure I'd be doing this,"" he says. ""I was all set to meet in makeup the next day at 4.30 a.m. when I got an email saying it might be scrapped. ""Via a couple of phone calls a few minutes later, sure enough, it was over. I was just lost, it was like losing a family member. In that first week, I made the decision to come back."" Stevens will forever be grateful for his acting career -- he describes it as one of ""two dream jobs I've had"" -- but it has also acted as Cupid for him, having met his wife Angie on the first day of filming ""Seabiscuit."" ""I turned up on the set and this lady appeared as a silhouette. She said, 'You look lost,' and I was like, 'I need to find where I'm supposed to be.' I explained I was playing George Woolf and she showed me to my trailer."" He did not lay eyes on her for the next five months but, as the movie wrapped up, they met again, went for dinner and the rest is history. Such Hollywood-esque nuggets are littered throughout the life of the man from Caldwell, Idaho. There was the hip condition called Perthes syndrome that forced him to wear a metal brace for 19 months at the age of seven, his decision to drop out of high school in 1979 to become a jockey -- also the year he won his first race -- difficulties with alcohol in his career, and now the ongoing return to the sport of kings: all quite remarkable for a grandfather. But he argues he is currently at his happiest. ""It's an unbelievable ride, better than the first time around,"" he says. ""It's been very gratifying as I don't think people expected me to come back at the level I did. I didn't expect it. But I'm very hard on myself and motivated so I made it happen. That was the thing missing in my life, I just didn't have anything to push myself."" How is the Stevens Mark II in his own mindset as a jockey? ""I think I'm better in the sense that my broadcast work has made me more analytical,"" he adds. ""I really think watching racing for seven years has developed my skills. ""It's been crazy, what a journey, hey? If it ends tomorrow I'd be a happy guy. My life is more than half over and it's been a good life."" The Hollywood ending, it would seem, has already been sealed.","Stevens is relishing life in the saddle having returned to being a jockey past his 50th birthday .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A man in an Afghan military uniform killed three U.S. troops Friday in southern Afghanistan, the latest in a series of assaults against NATO soldiers by Afghans clad in security force garb. The man opened fire on the troops in the volatile Helmand province, said Maj. Lori Hodge, a spokeswoman for the International Assistance Security Force. Hodge did not immediately provide details about the attack, one of a handful in recent weeks to target NATO troops. A Defense Department official said the three troops killed were part of a Special Operations Forces mission to stabilize a village in the Sarwan Qala area. They were meeting with local officials. NATO and Afghan troops have been searching for the gunman. ""It is too early to say that this latest incident is part of a stepped-up effort on the insurgents' part,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said. ""We know they are trying to maximize media exposure of these events but our military believes that the operational impact has been negligible. Nonetheless these incidents do concern us and our hearts go out to all the victims and their families."" In the strikes, known as ""green-on-blue"" attacks, Afghan security forces or militants dressed as local police or soldiers target coalition troops. The problem has sapped troop morale, and coalition forces have been working to address it. Earlier this year, Gen. John Allen, commander of the NATO-led force, said the systems that Afghans and coalition forces had put in place to help prevent these attacks were having an effect. Allen said coalition officials were working on a new procedure to check the backgrounds of Afghans who sign up for the army or police force, and the Afghans ""have taken a lot of steps themselves."" Bill Roggio, a terrorism analyst, said Afghan security personnel have killed an estimated 93 ISAF soldiers since May 2007, and they have killed 31 this year alone across the country. These attacks have taken place in all areas in Afghanistan, not just in the south and east, said Roggio, managing editor of the Long War Journal blog, which reports and analyzes terror issues. Two other green-on-blue incidents occurred this week, Roggio said. One was the killing of a U.S. soldier Tuesday by two Afghans wearing army uniforms. On Thursday, U.S. troops killed an Afghan soldier who tried to gun them down at a training center in Laghman province. ""The attack types are about split: About half seem to be Taliban infiltrators, or ANSF members who were turned by the Taliban,"" said Roggio. ANSF stands for Afghan National Security Forces. Remembering the Chinook crash, a year later . ""The other half seem to be disgruntled security personnel who have turned on troops for some sort of grievance. It is very difficult to know exactly what is happening given that ISAF does not release a lot of information on these attacks."" Afghan intelligence agents have started going undercover during recruit training to spot signs of extremist tendencies among the newcomers, military officials say. ""The U.S. military has become so concerned with the green-on-blue attacks that it has ordered units to designate 'guardian angels' in each unit whose job is to provide security for troops working with Afghans. But the attacks have not abated,"" Roggio said. Elsewhere in Helmand, a vehicle struck a roadside mine Friday, killing six civilians and wounding five others, President Hamid Karzai's office said. Women and children were among the casualties in the bombing, which Karzai condemned. The British Defense Ministry announced Friday that one of its soldiers was killed in ""enemy action"" while on patrol in the Nad Ali district of Helmand on Thursday. High-profile insurgent attacks against NATO and Afghan targets persist as the United States reduces its troop strength ahead of an anticipated 2014 handover of responsibility to Afghan forces. In a separate incident, a strike Wednesday in Kunar province left five people dead -- USAID Foreign Service Officer Ragaei Abdelfattah, three ISAF service members and an Afghan civilian -- and injured a State Department Foreign Service officer. The Department of Defense said that the three American troops died ""of wounds suffered when they encountered an insurgent who detonated a suicide vest."" Violence has raged during the Afghan war in Kunar province, on the border with Pakistan. ""On behalf of President Obama and the American people, I have sent my deepest condolences to Ragaei's family and to the entire U.S. Mission in Afghanistan,"" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a written statement released late Thursday. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, saying two bombers targeted the American soldier near the entrance of the compound of the province council in Asadabad, according to a statement released by spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid. Mujahid said the attack occurred as the troops were exiting a military vehicle and gathering to enter the compound. The Taliban claimed to have killed 17 soldiers, though the group is known to routinely claim responsibility for attacks and inflate casualty numbers. The Defense Department identified the slain soldiers: . -- Army Command Sgt. Maj. Kevin J. Griffin, the senior enlisted soldier of the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division from Fort Carson, Colorado. -- Army Maj. Thomas E. Kennedy, 35, of West Point, New York. -- Air Force Maj. Walter D. Gray, 38, of Conyers, Georgia. Kennedy served on the brigade staff, while Gray was a flight commander attached as a liaison to the brigade, according to their respective service records. Griffin, 45, of Laramie, Wyoming, was the brigade's senior ranking non-commissioned officer, the Defense Department said. He joined the Army in 1988 and participated in the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, according to his service records. Griffin deployed twice more to Iraq, once in 2007 and again in 2009. He deployed to Afghanistan in March with a headquarters company of the brigade. Kennedy was commissioned as an officer in 2000. He served two tours in Iraq in 2003 and 2005. According to his service record, Kennedy deployed to Afghanistan on July 18. Gray was assigned to the 13th Air Support Operations Squadron at Fort Carson. An Afghan interpreter was also killed, the State Department said. Troops were also wounded in the attack, said Maj. Martyn Crighton, a NATO spokesman.

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Naked, bound and blindfolded, a crudely shot video shows a man being pushed to the ground by men wearing what appear to be military, camouflage fatigues. Sri Lanka's military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara claims the video was staged. One of the men kicks the blindfolded man in the back. Another man raises a gun, points it at the back of the man's head and pulls the trigger. A loud crack is heard; the man slumps to the ground. Off-camera, someone can be heard saying in Sinhala, the majority language of Sri Lanka, ""I think he looked back."" The execution-style shooting is repeated with a second man, also bound and naked. Off-camera, a voice can be heard saying, ""This is like hitting midgets."" All the while someone is recording the scene, apparently with a cellphone camera. Panning across the open field, the camera reveals nine bodies, some lying in pools of blood. From the video alone, it's impossible to tell who they were or who killed them. The video was obtained by Journalists for Democracy in Sri Lanka, an advocacy group based in Berlin, Germany, that accuses the Sri Lankan government of harassing and intimidating journalists. CNN could not independently verify the authenticity of the video nor could it determine when or where it was shot, but sources in Sri Lanka told CNN they believe it was shot in January as the army closed in on the remnants of the Tigers. Journalists for Democracy says it is evidence of atrocities committed during the final months of the 26-year conflict that became infamous for its merciless killing: the jungle warfare between the Sri Lankan army and the Tamil Tiger rebels. Each side has accused the other of atrocities, though evidence surfaced to support the claims has surfaced only rarely. A Sri Lankan official said the video proves nothing.  Watch footage from the video » . ""Sri Lankan soldiers never get involved in this kind of a situation,"" Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara told CNN. ""We are 100 percent sure it has nothing to do with Sri Lankan soldiers; it is all created and staged."" Asked if he was saying the video was faked, he answered, ""This is all fake ... I feel it's not an actual situation, it's a created one."" The Sri Lankan High Commission (Embassy) in London issued a statement to CNN affiliate Channel 4 News, which first aired the video, saying that, ""in many instances in the past, various media institutions used doctored videos, photographs and documents to defame the Sri Lankan government and armed forces."" But Journalists for Democracy -- which would divulge neither how it obtained the video nor from where -- said the the men carrying out the executions are wearing Sri Lankan military uniforms. Independent observers were largely excluded from the conflict zone during the war in Sri Lanka. Even today access remains tightly restricted. Not everyone is buying the government's assertion that it was not involved in the killings. ""The Sri Lankan government has had a pattern of lying during this conflict,"" said Yolanda Foster, Amnesty International's Sri Lankan expert. While the video's authenticity cannot be independently verified, the organization has received reports from survivors of the conflict that suggest war crimes were committed, she said. ""Given the restrictions given on the media, the fact that the government is not allowing people to freely interview the displaced who may be able to share accounts of what happened in the final months of the war, it is urgent that there is an independent investigation,"" Foster said. That appears unlikely to occur any time soon. The government routinely rejects calls by human rights groups for independent investigations into its campaign against the Tigers. But Nanayakkara told CNN the government will try to find out who is trying to discredit the Sri Lankan government by releasing what it called a faked video. ""This is to tarnish the image of Sri Lanka,"" he said.","Video obtained by Journalists for Democracy in Sri Lanka shows apparent atrocity .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Harry Patch -- the last surviving British soldier from World War I -- died Saturday at the age of 111, Britain's Ministry of Defence said. Harry Patch, pictured here on November 11, 2008, at an Armistice Day commemoration ceremony in London. Patch died peacefully at his care home in the southwestern English city of Wells, the ministry announced. His death came a week after fellow British World War I veteran Henry Allingham died at the age of 113. Patch was the last surviving soldier to have witnessed the horrors of trench warfare in the first World War . He fought and was seriously wounded in Ypres, Belgium, in 1917 at the Battle of Passchendaele, in which 70,000 of his fellow soldiers died -- including three of his close friends. Born in 1898, Patch became a plumber before being conscripted to the army in 1916. After training, Patch was recruited to The Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry as a Lewis gunner assistant. The unit was rushed to the front line trenches of Ypres, where soldiers were urgently needed to replace those who were wounded and dying by the thousand. He fought in the trenches between June and September of 1917 and was involved in some of the fiercest fighting of the war. In late September he was wounded when a light shell exploded above his head, bringing an end to his military service. He received battlefield treatment without anesthetic. After the war, Harry returned to his work as a plumber and later became a sanitary engineer. He married Ada Billington, a young girl he met while convalescing after the battle. They married in 1919 and had two sons. In World War II, Patch joined the Auxiliary Fire Service and helped tackle the fires caused by heavy German raids on the English cities of Bath and Bristol. At one point, he was sent to organize sanitary arrangements for soldiers at a camp near Yeovil, where he became friendly with some of the men. Patch remembered the shock of finding the camp deserted, with coffee still hot and meals half-eaten, on the morning that the soldiers had gone off to France, the Ministry of Defence said. His wife, Ada, died in 1976, and their two sons also later died. Patch remarried in 1980, but he became a widower for the second time four years later. Patch didn't speak about the war until he turned 100, the Ministry of Defence said. ""He tried to suppress the memories and to live as normal a life as possible; the culture of his time said that he was fortunate to have survived and that he should get on with his life,"" a Ministry of Defence biography says. ""That suited Harry; he could 'forget' his demons, the memories of what happened to him and to his close friends."" In 1998, a television producer with an interest in the war talked to Patch, who then made the decision to speak of his memories, the Ministry of Defence said. He took part in a documentary on the war and began gradually to open up. It wasn't long before Patch became a spokesman for his generation, speaking about the horrors of the war as well as his own emotions and reactions, the Ministry of Defence said. ""In speaking about his experiences, Harry began at last to come to terms with his war, and was at peace with himself and his memories,"" the Defence Ministry said. ""His thoughts then turned to reconciliation, to the long-term effects of suffering and coming to terms with that suffering."" Patch returned to Belgium in 2002, something he had said he would never do, and laid a wreath to his battalion, the Defence Ministry said. Two years later, he met and shook hands with a German artilleryman from the Western Front, Charles Kuentz. Patch later laid a wreath at Langemark Cemetery for the German war dead. In his last years, Patch was honored at Buckingham Palace and the prime minister's residence at 10 Downing Street. On his 101st birthday France awarded him the Knighthood of the Legion of Honor, and this year President Nicolas Sarkozy upgraded that to the rank of officer. Last year, King Albert II of Belgium made Patch a Knight of the Order of Leopold. ""Harry was delighted to receive these awards and wore the medals with great pride, but he always made it clear that he wore these medals as a representative of the selfless generation he had come to represent,"" the Ministry of Defence said. Patch wrote a book detailing his life in 2007, called ""The Last Fighting Tommy."" The name referred to the slang term for British privates. ""While the country may remember Harry as a soldier, we will remember him as a dear friend,"" said Jim Ross, a close friend. ""He was a man of peace who used his great age and fame as the last survivor of the trenches to communicate two simple messages: Remember with gratitude and respect those who served on all sides, (and) settle disputes by discussion, not war."" Gen. Richard Dannatt, the chief of the general staff, issued a statement expressing his sadness about Patch's death. ""Self-effacing about his experiences in the trenches he was no less effective in describing the horror they represented when invited to speak to schoolchildren about the realities of war."" Dannatt said. ""He was the last of a generation that in youth was steadfast in its duty in the face of cruel sacrifice and we give thanks for his life -- as well as those of his comrades -- for upholding the same values and freedom that we continue to cherish and fight for today.""","Harry Patch, dead at 111, was last British survivor of World War One trench warfare .

"Washington (CNN) -- Ted Cruz appears to have played a key role in the emergency border bill falling apart in the House. Less than 24 hours before GOP leaders pulled a vote on Thursday on the $659 million emergency measure to address the crisis provoked by a surge of migrant youth from Central America, the arch-conservative Republican senator had lobbied House allies to scrap it unless it included a provision to toughen deportation policy. Support for the bill as written was already tenuous at best, but Cruz held sway, for the moment anyway. Negotiations were scheduled to run into Thursday night with a GOP meeting set for Friday morning to discuss next steps. Still, the meddling complicated an already arduous process in both the House and the Senate of marshaling support to help thousands minors, many unaccompanied and still stuck in a legal limbo that is stressing immigration services. Ground zero for the crisis is the Rio Grande crossing in Cruz's home state of Texas. Has his reasons . Cruz had his reasons and it wasn't the first time he's figuratively crossed the Capitol to buck Republican leaders to make his case to conservative members. The move that heightened legislative uncertainty most likely leaves President Barack Obama able to throw pretty sharp darts at House Republicans. Obama's sure to blame them for doing nothing about the border crisis as Congress stops work for a month-long summer recess, likely leaving him to use his executive powers to do what he can in the meantime. Even though getting a bitterly divided Congress to agree on a common approach on the border crisis in a midterm election year was a long shot from the start, it appears lawmakers in both parties won't even have the political cover as they arrive home of having voted for or against something in their own chamber. ""The Obama White House should put Ted Cruz on the payroll,"" Republican Rep. Peter King of New York quipped to the Washington Post following Cruz's latest foray into House affairs. What was he after anyway? Cruz, a tea party star who may have presidential ambitions, met with House allies on Wednesday night in is office where pizza was served. His office wasn't saying much about it. But others who were there said he pushed them hard for a provision that would bar the Obama administration from expanding a policy that prevents deportation of immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. He urged them to oppose the emergency border bill backed by Speaker John Boehner and his lieutenants unless it defunded that policy. Cruz likens it to amnesty even though it does not convey legal status. California GOP Rep. Devin Nunes said Cruz's intervention was ""not helpful."" ""It's kind of shocking to me that some of our members are willing to turn their voting cards over to the Senate or to outside groups,"" Nunes said of those following Cruz' lead. But Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican who attended the dinner meeting with Cruz, said the attendees did not make a pact on the House bill and denied that he twisted any arms to kill it, as Republican leadership aides have claimed. ""I don't think that would be accurate,"" he told CNN Senior Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash. ""Ted's a listener."" Remember the shutdown . The scenario on Thursday conjured up memories of last fall, when Cruz led the charge against funding Obamacare that helped draw Congress into a government shutdown. At the time, Cruz rallied tea party allies in the House to join his dogged opposition to Obama's signature health law, which remains a partisan political flashpoint. Instead of working for compromise in the days before the shutdown, Cruz took to the Senate floor for 21 hours to push against Obamacare. The shutdown lasted 16 days. Boehner and other Republicans admitted the tactic was a mistake and some, like Sen. John McCain, called it futile. ""It was a fool's errand to start with. It was never going to succeed,"" McCain said then on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Cruz placed the blame squarely on Democrats and the White House and denied his role in provoking the shutdown, despite being branded by Democrats and even some Republicans as the architect of the standoff. And then there was Cruz and the debt ceiling. And the debt ceiling . Just months later, Cruz again angered fellow Republicans by blocking a vote to raise the nation's borrowing authority so it could pay its bills. Republicans quickly scuttled Cruz's filibuster attempt, which would have forced at least 60 senators to vote in favor of raising the debt limit to avoid a U.S. debt default. That would have forced some Republicans into the awkward position of voting against the measure and being seen as responsible for another shutdown or voting for it and hurting their standing with conservatives. That procedural move provoked a contentious exchange between Cruz and his GOP colleagues as he accused the Republican leadership of ""trickery."" Cautious on primaries . Cruz has since cautiously waded into primary politics this election cycle by linking up -- often quietly -- with conservative groups that are backing challengers and opposing establishment incumbents in several Senate primaries. Cruz appeared in a Senate Conservatives Fund ad backing a tea party-backed candidate vying for an open Oklahoma Senate seat in June. And that group has poured millions of dollars supporting challenges to Republican incumbents, including state Sen. Chris McDaniel's contentious challenge to veteran Sen. Thad Cochran and Matt Bevin's failed battle against Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Cruz also penned a fundraising appeal for the Madison Project, a PAC that set its sights on dethroning establishment figures ranging from Cochran to McConnell to Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- An underpants-clad New York guitarist known as the ""Naked Cowboy"" can proceed with his trademark infringement lawsuit against the maker of M&Ms and its ad agency, a New York judge has ruled. The Naked Cowboy is part of the scenery at New York's Times Square. Robert Burck has become a fixture in Times Square for playing the guitar dressed in a white cowboy hat, white cowboy boots and white underpants while tourists pose with him for pictures and slip money into his boots. In February, the street performer filed a lawsuit against Mars Inc. and Chute Gerdeman Inc., after they released a video billboard showing a guitar-playing blue M&M dressed in a white cowboy hat, cowboy boots and underpants. The company also ran print ads showing a similar yellow M&M. Burck says in his lawsuit that he has registered trademarks to the Naked Cowboy name and likeness. The lawsuit alleges that the ads violate Burck's right to privacy and infringe on his trademark by ""using his likeness, persona, and image for commercial purposes without his written permission and by falsely suggesting that he endorses M&M candy.""  Watch the Naked Cowboy in his natural environment » . U.S. District Judge Denny Chin ruled Monday that the trademark infringement claim can proceed. Chin dismissed the privacy claim, however, saying New York law protects only the ""name, portrait, or picture of a living person"" and not a character ""created or a role performed by a living person,"" according to a statement from the court. Lawyers for Mars and Chute Gerdeman did not return calls for comment. Mars issued a statement saying, ""we do not comment on matters of litigation. However, as a good corporate citizen, Mars will handle this matter accordingly."" Burck said he is looking forward to pursuing the matter. ""I have spent 10 years in every kind of weather and going through the legal, step by step [process of getting a trademark],"" Burck said. ""It is imperative that damages are pushed so ... an example will be set."" iReport.com: One of the Naked Cowboy's biggest fans . He is seeking up to $100 million in punitive damages, plus attorney's fees. Chin ordered attorneys for both sides to appear at a pretrial conference July 11, according to the statement.

"(CNN) -- UPS has trucks up and running Thursday -- and hopes that holiday cheer may assuage the frustrations of angry customers. The shipping giant's backlog left some Americans with gifts missing from under the Christmas tree Wednesday. ""We're terribly sorry,"" spokeswoman Natalie Black told CNN. FedEx was late with some deliveries as well, but those were ""isolated incidents,"" the company said in a statement Thursday. FedEx ""experienced no major service disruptions in the week before Christmas despite heavy volume. Every single package is important to us, and we will continue to work directly with customers to address any isolated incidents,"" the statement said. On Wednesday, FedEx spokesman Scott Fiedler told The Associated Press, ""We're sorry that there could be delays and we're contacting affected customers who have shipments available for pickup."" The U.S. Postal Service had no immediate comment on whether it experienced any similar delays. Spokeswoman Zy Richardson said in an e-mail, ""We take great pride in delivering packages for our customers in time for their holiday. ... Our carriers continued to deliver mail on Christmas Day, in many locations, to make sure everyone enjoyed their holiday."" UPS did some package sorting Wednesday, but the company stuck to its plan to make no deliveries on Christmas, giving drivers a break after doing a lot of special deliveries Sunday. Both UPS and FedEx noted they were handling hundreds of millions of shipments in a compressed holiday shopping time frame, because Thanksgiving was later than usual this year. FedEx is projected to handle 275 million shipments, and ""operated with very high service levels -- over 99% at FedEx Ground, for example -- during our busiest time of the year,"" Fiedler's statement said. Black, at UPS, said that last week, during the peak of shipping season, ""we projected to deliver more than 132 million packages."" The company got more air shipments than it expected and was already dealing with a backlog from previous severe weather in the Dallas area, Black said. ""Thanks for totally screwing us AND lying about it all day,"" customer Mo Husseini posted on Twitter in response to a UPS tweet. Some packages declared 'delivered' weren't, customers say . Some UPS customers said they received tracking notices stating their packages had been delivered. But they weren't. And they complained about their experience on Twitter. ""Expected 3 packages on Xmas eve. All marked 'Delivered - Left at Other - Released' at exactly 5 pm,"" Von Hertzog tweeted. ""No delivery made here. Answers?"" UPS customer support tweeted back, providing an e-mail address to help get the situation resolved. But the company had no immediate comment Thursday about what may have happened. ""We know how hard it is for everyone to receive their holiday packages, and we're working around the clock to resolve this issue,"" Black said Wednesday. On the company's Facebook page, Melissa Gilbreath wrote that she ordered her sons' gifts on December 9, but the packages have sat in Fort Worth, Texas, since December 18. ""I realize it is not about the gifts but that is part of Christmas,"" she wrote. But the Facebook page is also filled with messages from people who say they are UPS employees and proud of their work and the company. ""We all work really hard and I think people have too high of expectations,"" Misty Fulton wrote. Amazon responds . Online retailers who promised customers delivery in time for Christmas have been affected by UPS' problems. Some customers received messages from Amazon.com alerting them of the ""failure in the UPS transportation network."" In the message, the company offered to refund shipping charges and provide gift cards. ""Amazon fulfillment centers processed and tendered customer orders to delivery carriers on time for holiday delivery,"" spokeswoman Mary Osako told CNN. ""We are reviewing the performance of the delivery carriers."" ""We have a relationship with Amazon. We will definitely work with all of our retailers,"" Black said. ""We're going to make good on our service commitments. What that exactly entails I don't know, but we'll work with them to maintain that relationship."" After January 2, the day the industry processes returns of holiday gifts, the company will examine what happened and gauge its contingency planning and losses, she said. Weather has caused delays in previous years. Technical glitches have as well, but Black said it's been ""quite some time"" since that happened. Medicine didn't arrive . The backlog isn't just affecting Christmas presents. The Warren family of Heath, Texas, had to go a few days without special medicine their 14-year-old son needs in order to eat. ""It was just sitting"" at a UPS outlet in Mesquite, where the family finally picked it up, Patrick Warren told CNN affiliate WFAA-TV on Tuesday. ""People are really upset in there. They have security guards,"" one woman outside the UPS distribution center in Fort Worth told WFAA.

"(CNN) -- The next time Minnesota drivers looking to play the Powerball lottery pay at the pump, the pump might pay them back. The Minnesota State Lottery has launched a pilot program to allow customers to purchase lottery tickets while they fill up their cars. This week's winning tickets for the $587.5 million Powerball jackpot were purchased at convenience stores, but Ed Van Petten, director of the Minnesota State Lottery, said sales of lottery tickets at gas pumps have been brisk. It works like this: Customers who use debit cards to fill up can enter their mobile phone numbers when they buy a lottery ticket at the pump. Their lottery numbers are then sent to their phone via text message, and the pump prints out a receipt. After the drawing, drivers get a text message telling them whether they won. Drivers can track their playing history and choose to have winnings of $599 or less paid directly to their accounts. Credit cards are not permitted. The program was developed by Linq3, a New York-based software developer. Van Petten said developers approached several states before partnering with Minnesota Lottery officials. The same lottery software is also available at various ATMs in sports bars and even at a state driver's license office and is part of the same Minnesota pilot program. Van Petten said South Africa is the only other place he knew of that allows lottery purchases through ATMs. Minnesota lottery officials have set a weekly purchase limit of $50 through gas pumps and ATM machines to encourage responsible gaming, Van Petten said. ""We're the only ones in the world who are doing this,"" Van Petten told CNN. The prize for the Powerball lottery -- held in 42 states, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia -- swelled to the largest jackpot in Powerball history after the jackpot rolled over 16 times without a winner. Two winning tickets matched all the numbers in Wednesday night's drawing. On Friday, a Missouri family collected its half of the prize money. Lottery officials have not yet confirmed the identity of the other winner, who bought a ticket in Arizona. Meet the Powerball winners .

"(CNN) -- Part of the solution to end drug violence in Mexico should include legalizing drugs like marijuana for personal use, former President Vicente Fox told CNN en Espanol. ""In order to get out of this trap (of drug violence caused by organized crime), I'm specifically proposing the legalization of the drug,"" Fox said during a visit to Puerto Rico, where he was speaking at a conference for small business owners in the city of Fajardo. Fox advocated decriminalizing marijuana in a 2009 interview with CNN en Espanol. Since then, he has repeatedly called on officials to rethink drug laws. In an interview that aired on CNN en Espanol Tuesday, he also said the Mexican government should ""retire the army from the task of combating criminal gangs."" Current Mexican President Felipe Calderon has sent as many as 50,000 troops to hot spots around Mexico to fight the drug cartels. The enforcement strategy is considered a pillar in Calderon's overall anti-drug policy. Both Calderon and Fox belong to the conservative PAN (National Action Party). Ex-President Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive who was the president of Mexico from 2000 to 2006, said the Mexican government should also ""demand that the United States do its part."" ""The United States has a huge responsibility. It's not enough that they give us (Mexico) a tip, saying 'Here's 500 million dollars. Go do your homework. You can pay us back with blood and with dead bodies,' "" Fox said. Mexican drug cartels buy their weapons and launder drug money in the United States, he said. Fox said Mexico has fallen into a trap ""between the gigantic U.S. drug market and the (illicit) drug producers in South American countries like Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador and others. Fox is not alone in advocating for legalization of some drugs for personal use. Two years ago, three former Latin American presidents proposed radical changes in drug policy for the region. Brazil's Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Colombia's Cesar Gaviria, and Mexico's Ernesto Zedillo wrote in the 2009 final report of the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy that ""Prohibitionist policies based on the eradication of production and on the disruption of drug flows as well as on the criminalization of consumption have not yielded the expected results. We are farther than ever from the announced goal of eradicating drugs."" The same conclusion was reached by the U.N.'s Global Commission on Drug Policy last month. The commission, comprised of former presidents (including Fox), policymakers and leaders from all over the world, recommended that governments experiment with drug legalization, especially marijuana.

The University of Kentucky's solar car races along the road, on its way to the finish line. (UWIRE) -- In the world of higher education, summer is usually the off-season. But for some students, this summer was the culmination of years of hard work in a 2,400-mile solar car race from Plano, Texas to Calgary, Alberta. Fifteen teams of students drove photovoltaic-powered cars across the North American Solar Challenge finish line in Calgary Tuesday, led by the University of Michigan Solar Car Team and its vehicle, Continuum. Placing second was the car Ra 7 from Principia College, followed by the sole European finisher, the German FH Bochum Solar Car Team. Michigan's victory, which took about 51 hours and 42 minutes on the road, is its fifth NASC championship. The school also won the last NASC, in 2005. It took Principia almost ten hours more than Michigan to complete the race, in about 61 hours and 38 minutes. Bochum's car took about two hours more, but the University of Waterloo Midnight Sun Solar Car Team was a very close fourth, taking about fifteen minutes longer. Principia's success may be as noteworthy as Michigan's margin of victory. The college has fewer than 550 students, all of them undergraduates. It's a sharp contrast from the enormous research universities that traditionally win solar car races. ""It's unique, I think, for their college to field a team, (because) they don't have an engineering school,"" said Dan Eberle, NASC's organizer. But he noted that small teams have had some success in the past. ""If you can get a group of folks who are really committed, then you can do a lot,"" he said. Driving force . Jeff Ferman, the race manager for Michigan, talked about how rewarding it was to enter Calgary and be greeted by 40,000 people. ""All the time and dedication really paid off,"" he said. ""We got to get out and walk across the finish line with (the car). It was great."" ""The streets were lined with people,"" he said. ""There were people on overpasses with tripods taking pictures."" The Michigan team led almost the entire race from Texas, trailing only on the first day of driving when it had to stop to fix a minor electrical problem. But that 20-minute stop was the only time it had to pull over to make repairs, which team members said was one reason they did so well. ""Reliability is one of the key things,"" said Steve Hechtman, Michigan's project manager and a driver. ""As they get more miles, teams start to get more problems with the car."" ""Once we left Fargo we just started pulling away from the other teams,"" he said, referring to the stop the cars made in Fargo, North Dakota Saturday. Eberle said building a reliable car is ""the first criteria"" for a successful solar car team. ""There's two things that really make a team,"" he said, discussing Continuum's crew. ""One is they're very well-organized. Two is that they've been able to stay on the road."" Eberle said he was still surprised how far ahead of the rest of the field Michigan was. Powering up . He noted that Michigan uses gallium arsenide multi-junction photovoltaic cells on their car. The gallium cells can provide almost 50 percent more power than silicon photovoltaic cells, but are nearly twice as expensive. Principia and a number of other teams also use the gallium cells. ""We do limit the surface area of the gallium cells,"" Eberle said, but added, ""the people who came in first are the people with the high-performance cells."" Luke Martz, director of fundraising for Iowa State University's PrISUm Solar Car Team, said he thought the difference between the types of cells teams used had a major impact on the race. PrISUm, which placed eighth, uses silicon cells. ""There's not anything that I hold against any other teams that did use gallium cells,"" he said. ""But it's like apples and oranges."" Darshni Pillay, operations manager for the University of Calgary Solar Car Team, disagreed about the advantage provided by the gallium cells. Her team, which uses the more expensive cells, came in sixth, two spots ahead of PrISUm. ""I really don't think that would have been a deciding factor,"" she said. She said the regulation limiting the surface area of the cells negated most of the advantage they provided. Pillay pointed out that Calgary's team, like PrISUm, had to tow its car when cloud cover was heavy in the early stages of the race. She said the reason leading teams didn't have to ""trailer"" -- which is legal but incurs a time penalty -- was because they were able to get ahead of the weather, not because of any superior technology. Finishing the race . Martz and Pillay both said they were happy with their results. Pillay pointed out that this year was only the second NASC her team has competed in, and said sixth is a big step up from their last finish. In 2005 Calgary's team placed 13th. PrISUm's finish in the middle of the pack is noteworthy because the team barely managed to qualify for the race. Its car didn't, in fact, finish the 60 laps on a closed race track in Plano, Texas necessary to qualify for the race. Martz said the car had mechanical problems when it first arrived in Texas and so the team only got it on the track on the second day of a two-day qualifying process. PrISUm only was allowed to compete after finishing the first leg of the trip, to Neosho, Missouri, in the allotted time without trailering. The teams from Durham University and Oregon State University, which also didn't qualify on the closed track, didn't make it to Neosho in time. ""I think we did exceptionally well with what we had,"" Martz said. He noted that when the car had problems, the other teams were eager to help. ""If there's a team that's struggling,"" he said, ""they're going to get help from whoever's available."" Pillay added one caveat. ""Everyone's sympathetic to each other and wants to see all the other teams cross the finish line,"" she said. ""Maybe just not in front of them.""","University of Michigan's team finishes solar-car race in first place .

"SAN DIEGO (CNN) -- ""When I got out of the Army, I did not want to talk about my war experience,"" said Angela Kozak, currently a speech pathology student at San Diego State University. The transition from war zone to classroom was not easy for the 30-something-year-old veteran. ""The first semester I came here, I was kind of stand-offish. I didn't get involved in anything. I wasn't really clicking with the people in my classes. They were 19, 20, 21 years old,"" she said. Things changed when she discovered the SDSU Veterans Center, where she met men and women with similar life experiences. ""It's made my college experience a hundred times better,"" she said. San Diego State University is one of the first in the country to provide a single location on campus where veterans can access their benefits, meet others with common military backgrounds, and even relax and play Xbox. The staff at the Joan and Art Barron Veterans Center does everything from helping coordinate psychological counseling for veterans who might need it, to managing the nation's first on-campus housing reserved exclusively for veterans. ""Veterans have these shared life experiences, issues that they might be dealing with that only they can understand because they've lived it,"" said Joan Putnam, the director of the SDSU Veterans center. The students have been stopping by this week to enjoy the ""bunker,"" a lounge at the center with one wall covered in camouflage netting and providing coffee, tea and snacks during finals. As the war winds down in Iraq and many men and women are retiring from the military, San Diego State recognizes a need to serve this type of student. Nationally, about 450,000 people used the Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits for college this fall, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. ""We are anticipating that the people who are taking advantage of the Post 9/11 GI Bill over the course of the next several years will rise as we draw down and people get out of the services,"" said Curtis Coy, undersecretary for economic opportunity at the Department of Veterans Affairs. ""The numbers are absolutely going up,"" said Keith Wilson, the educational services director of the VA. Since 2009 -- the first year for the Post 9/11 GI Bill -- the number of participants has increased by 50%. Share your Iraq war stories . The SDSU Veterans Center currently serves around a thousand students and is a selling point for the university to attract even more student veterans. ""I knew that leaving the military, I personally wanted a little bit of a safety net,"" said Holly Shaffner, who retired from the Coast Guard at the end of October after 24 years in the service. ""I knew that San Diego was a big veteran's community so I chose to come to San Diego State."" Like Kozak, Shaffner felt she was different from the younger students who don't share her background. ""They don't have the same maturity level, the same goals, the same vision for the class,"" she said. ""I sit at the head of the class. I'm studious. I take notes. Their principles aren't the same right now."" ""Veterans are not your typical kid right out of high school. They are disciplined. So there's lots of those sort of nuanced reasons why school would want to have veterans on campus,"" said Coy. The American Council on Education surveyed 723 colleges and universities in 2009 and found that 65% of the respondents who offered services to veterans and military personnel prior to September 11, 2001, had increased their emphasis on those services since that time. This included adding new programs for military and veterans, and marketing and outreach strategies aimed at those groups. Todd Kennedy retired from the Marine Corps after a 22-year military career. He served in Desert Storm in 1991, and Restore Hope in Somalia in 1992. He did two tours in Iraq in 2006 and 2009. The history major decided to retire in November 2010 while serving in Afghanistan, and he started the college entrance paperwork process before returning to the United States. Kennedy says the SDSU Veterans Center has been a big help as he moves into the next chapter in his life. Whether they are 22 years old or 32 years old, the veterans all share a common bond, Kennedy said. ""If something is bugging you, you've got someone who speaks the same language, so it's been a really good transition tool,"" he said.","VA: About 450,000 people used Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits for college this fall .

"(CNN) -- Severe thunderstorms ripped through central Oklahoma Monday triggering vicious flash floods that left 136 people injured, roads and cars submerged, and thousands without power, authorities said. None of those injured required hospitalization, according to Michelann Ooten, information officer for the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management. Meanwhile, thunderstorms continued to roll across the southwestern and south-central part of the state Monday evening, sparing Oklahoma City more rain that would have likely worsened the flooding there. A state of emergency has been declared in 59 of Oklahoma's 77 counties, at the request of Gov. Brad Henry, who is out of town. Lt. Gov. Jari Askins, who approved the emergency paperwork, commended the state's emergency crews, saying, ""Once again, our heroic responders have demonstrated the Oklahoma Standard."" The National Weather Service said that almost 10 inches of rain fell between 2 a.m. and 11 a.m. Monday. A flash-flood watch was extended across central Oklahoma through 7 a.m. CT (8 a.m. ET) Tuesday. CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said the damage Monday morning was caused by ""backbuilding thunderstorms,"" a series of heavy rain cores without intermittent periods of let-up. The American Red Cross opened a center for any victims displaced by the storm at an elementary school in nearby Edmond, according the Ooten. According to Oklahoma Gas & Electric's website, close to 1,500 customers were still without power by 8 p.m. Monday, including 1,300 in the Oklahoma City metro area. It's a ""bad situation throughout the entire county,"" said Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office spokesman Mark Myers. Some washed-out Oklahoma City metro highways and ramps remained closed Monday night, including parts of Interstate 40, according to the Oklahoma Department of Transportation. Department officials urged drivers to be alert and warned them to avoid driving through water-covered roads. The Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported getting about 180 calls related to the flash flooding. Troopers worked nearly 30 crashes, with a total of six injuries. According to Ooten, several state buildings in the metro area were damaged in the deluge. Those affected agencies either closed or reduced their services because of the flooding. Standing flood waters also can be dangerous, the Oklahoma State Department of Health warned. They urged residents to avoid the water as it can contain snakes, insects, sharp objects, oil, gasoline, and in some case raw sewage. Glynda Chu, a police spokeswoman in nearby Edmond, said it was the worst flooding that city has seen in 25 years. CNN iReporter Jennifer Oliver, who lives in Edmond, says there's normally a little creek with a 20-foot waterfall behind her house, but by late morning, she couldn't even make it out. ""Never seen anything quite like that,"" Oliver said. KOCO broadcast pictures of a car submerged almost to its windows. Dive teams navigated the raging waters to get to the scene and then rescued the car's occupants by boat. CNN affiliate KFOR showed another water rescue, with crews ferrying people to safety. It's a dangerous situation for rescue crews as well. CNN affiliate KWTV showed gripping video of a woman trapped in a tree, struggling through the rushing water in search of stronger branches to hold. Oklahoma City Fire Battalion Chief Kirk Wright said the first rescue boat sent her way got stuck, stranding the three would-be rescuers. Another team set off for the scene and returned safely with all four people. Oklahoma City Fire Department Deputy Chief Marc Woodard estimated that there were 20 to 30 rescues of people stranded in cars, homes or businesses Monday morning. CNN iReporter Sarah Burris, who lives on the northwest side of Oklahoma City, said leaving her neighborhood wasn't even an option, with every way out under water. Burris said backlogged drains were regurgitating water into the streets. The National Weather Service was issuing flood warnings across the breadbasket region Monday. Most of Nebraska and southeastern Kansas were under advisories Monday afternoon. The Weather Service said 3 inches of rain had fallen in both Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Kansas City, Missouri, which experienced flash floods Monday morning. But Morris said the Kansas City overflow had affected only low-lying areas and didn't look like a threat to homes or businesses.","NEW: 136 people injured in Oklahoma flooding; none seriously .

"(CNN) -- Istanbul's new transcontinental train tunnel under the Bosphorus Strait had a bumpy first day of operation, a day after Turkey's Prime Minister called it a ""project for whole humanity"" at an inaugural ceremony. On Wednesday, Turkey's state railway confirmed reports there had been a power outage in the tunnel system. ""Emergency situation procedures"" were also carried out multiple times, the agency said in a statement posted online, because passengers hit emergency buttons aboard the trains. Turkish journalists complained of being barred from entry into the railway system after the breakdowns took place. ""Security personnel told journalists filming video, 'We received orders. It is not allowed to film anymore,' "" Turkish news agency DHA reported Wednesday. Amateur video posted on YouTube showed scores of passengers leaving a stopped train and walking down the long tube that has been constructed underneath the rushing waters of the Bosphorus Strait, effectively linking the European and Asian halves of Turkey's largest city. Turkey's Marmaray project: An ambitious plan to link Europe and Asia . Because of an unexpectedly large volume of curious first-time passengers, the railway agency also said it had decided to skip one of the stops on the train's transcontinental route. The Marmaray Tunnel is part of a $4.5 billion, 76-kilometer (47-mile) megaproject launched by the Turkish government in 2004. Speaking at a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by Japan's Prime Minister, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the project ""connects history and future, past and future; as well as connecting continents, Marmaray connects people, nations and countries."" The rail system, built by a Turkish-Japanese consortium, is expected to have a capacity of 1.5 million people a day, connecting the two continents in about four minutes. The 13.6-kilometer (8.5-mile) tunnel -- the deepest of its kind -- passes under the Bosphorus Strait, one of the busiest shipping arteries in the world. The world's spectacular infrastructure projects . The financial capital of Istanbul, with a population of nearly 15 million people, is often snarled with traffic, with about 2 million residents making the crossing between continents on a daily basis. Beyond the size of such an undertaking, digging for the Marmaray uncovered about 40,000 artifacts and helped archaeologists trace Istanbul's history back 8,500 years, 2,500 more than ever believed before. However, the discoveries delayed the project for four years, which frustrated the Prime Minister who, analysts and businessmen say, wants to put a permanent imprint on Turkey's financial capital. The project also had to account for Turkey's long history of violent earthquakes and the tunnel's position parallel to a major fault line. Transport minister Binali Yildirim has outlined the precautions, saying the tunnel allows movement and is designed to handle a quake of 9.0 magnitude. Connecting continents amid earthquakes . The Turkish government has also begun construction of a third suspension bridge across the Bosphorus Strait. It also plans to build a third airport for Istanbul and dredge a canal to run parallel to the Bosphorus. The massive government-backed development projects have become a politically polarizing issue in Turkey. Anti-government protests erupted last summer after the government announced plans to bulldoze a park in central Istanbul and replace it with a shopping mall. As government officials and crowds of supporters applauded the Marmaray tunnel's inauguration Tuesday, in other parts of Istanbul, riot police clashed with demonstrators protesting the Turkish government.

"(CNN) -- The 2014 midterm elections are quickly shaping up to be the most obscenely expensive ever. As more and more outside groups shell out an unlimited amount of campaign cash -- while accepting bottomless contributions from big business and anonymous wealthy donors -- stockpiling huge amounts of campaign cash has become a political arms race. Even so, this is the year concerned Americans can begin to turn it all around and get big money out of politics. Together, ""we the people"" can stamp out big money in politics. If we don't act now, we're in trouble. The Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision was a key ruling in opening up the gates to a torrent of spending by super PACs. Outside groups spent a whopping $2 billion in the 2012 election cycle, according to Federal Election Commission figures, compared with $298,549,659 in 2008. According to the Center for Responsive Politics' analysis of super PACs and politically active nonprofits, by November of last year these groups had burned through $20.6 million, more than three times the $6.3 million they'd laid out by the same point in the last election. ""Dark money"" organizations -- 501(c)(4) and 501(c)(6) nonprofits such as Americans for Prosperity or The League of Conservation Voters, which aren't required to disclose the names of their donors -- have nearly quintupled their spending of two years ago. And right now, the nation is awaiting the Supreme Court's decision in another case, McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission, which is challenging caps on the total amount that a wealthy donor can directly give to all PACs, campaigns and parties combined -- what's known as ""aggregate contribution limits."" If the court strikes down contribution limits, one affluent donor would be able to give more than $3 million in direct contributions. Currently, individual donor contributions are capped at $123,200 -- more than double the median family income in America. What's one impact of all this money? Many Americans are becoming convinced that their votes don't count, that our political process is controlled by the biggest bankroll, and that money, not the public interest, sets policies and priorities in government. Big money gives a big voice to the wealthy and corporations, at the expense of the rest of us. It threatens the democratic voice that is the foundation of our country. Freshman representatives in Congress are asked to spend nearly half their time raising money, many providing special interest lobbyists and elites with unprecedented access. These special interests can afford to pay $5,000 a plate for politicians' fund-raising breakfasts, or for such things as ski trips, pheasant hunts and luxury golf tournaments. This access shapes the issues that members of Congress care about. It inevitably promotes a ""pay to play"" government that leaves other citizens out in the cold and makes the public increasingly cynical that elections matter. What are the steps we must take to restore our political process to one determined by ""we the people""? Public financing of campaigns would restore the political voice of small contributors and the belief that the votes and voice of ordinary Americans count. Last week, Rep. John Sarbanes, D-Maryland, and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, introduced ""government by the people"" legislation that will empower ""we the people"" as small donors to fight back against big money in politics. With a ""Freedom from Influence Fund,"" financed by closing corporate tax loopholes, the bill would give small donors a $25 refundable tax credit, and match contributions of $150 or less at a rate of 6 to 1. This effort is similar to a public finance measure introduced in New York state, and other jurisdictions also are looking at this public financing model. Already 16 states, 500 municipalities and over 140 members of Congress are on record in support. While local and national advocates are driving key reforms, every citizen -- Democrats, independents and Republicans -- can help build the movement to get money out of politics by legally stamping messages like ""Not to be Used for Buying Elections"" on their paper currency. On average, a dollar bill stays in circulation for approximately two and a half years and is seen by 875 people. So as more stamped bills enter the marketplace, we can create a massive visual demonstration of support for reforms -- support that our elected representatives will no longer be able to ignore. If we care about a truly representative government and political process, one that engages and encourages the electorate to participate, then we must take action to get big money out of politics. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ben Cohen and Larry Cohen.","Ben Cohen, Larry Cohen: 2014 elections will see huge campaign donations, spending .

"(CNN) -- Manchester City continued their lavish spending spree by sealing the capture of England international James Milner from Aston Villa in a deal reportedly worth $37 million. Milner put pen to paper on a five-year deal with the English Premier League side as Stephen Ireland traveled in the opposite direction. The 24-year-old is the latest in a long line of big-name players to sign for Roberto Mancini's side, who are bankrolled by Abu Dhabi oil billionaire Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan. Earlier this week City bought striker Mario Balotelli from Inter Milan, to add to the signings of ex-Barcelona midfielder Yaya Toure, Germany defender Jerome Boateng, Serbian defender Aleksander Kolarov as well as Spain winger David Silva in deals that amounted to a reported $195 million. Milner's transfer was mooted long before he went to the World Cup with England, but he played his last game for Villa in their 3-0 defeat of West Ham on the opening day of the Premier League season on Saturday. He told City's official website: ""It didn't take too much selling by the boss when you see the players who are already here and the plans for the club. ""The last thing he said to me was ""be ready for the next game,"" and then he said ""be ready to win the Premier League,"" and that's my ultimate aim - that's what I want to do and why I'm here. ""There's a lot of competition to get there, it's where we all want to be. I'm ambitious and I want to win trophies here. I believe this is a great place to do that and I believe we will do it. Hopefully, sooner rather than later. ""The move seems to have gone on a long time - now all I want to do is get out on the field and play. I'm ready and raring to go now we've finally got everything done. I can't wait to start a new chapter."" Mancini said he was delighted to finally seal the deal for Milner: ""I am very happy to have James with us, everybody knows we have admired him for some time. ""He is an excellent midfielder, who can play in a number of positions. This is important for the team, and I am looking forward to seeing him play for us. We have a very strong squad, and this signing is a very important one for us. ""James is already a very good player, who has proved he can play at the very top level. But he is also young and a good character."" As for Ireland, the 23-year-old ended his five-year association with City to move to Villa Park, after slipping down the pecking order at Eastlands. He told Villa's official website: ""For me, my number one target is to work hard for my team-mates, show them what I can bring to the table, show them they can rely on me and that I am going to work hard for them week in, week out.""","Manchester City complete the signing of James Milner .

"(CNN) -- Twenty children and six adults killed in a town in Connecticut. Why? As someone who listens to killers as an expert psychological witness in murder cases, I have spent much of the last 20 years trying to understand how and why young men kill, maim and attack others. Killings like those in Newtown, Connecticut; Aurora, Colorado; and Virginia Tech are always met with expressions of shock, anger and sadness. These are understandable first reactions, but in the long run they accomplish nothing. So long as the discussion does not move beyond labeling these events ""senseless violence,"" horrors such as these never move us closer to a place of deeper understanding. Greater understanding is crucial because understanding leads to more peace and less violence through preventive action. All the crime scene investigations in the world will not do this. Although all our instincts urge us to dissociate from the killer, achieving better understanding requires us to put ourselves in his shoes no matter how frightening and distasteful that may be. I have done this over the past 20 years, and I have learned that it's the only way we can understand a fundamental truth: Although to the rest of us, the observers and the victims, extreme acts of violence seem ""senseless,"" these murderous acts make sense to the shooters. Masculinity, mental illness and guns: A lethal equation . This is true whether it's Adam Lanza in Newtown, Connecticut; James Holmes in Aurora, Colorado; Seung-Hui at Virginia Tech; Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris in Columbine, Colorado, and the many thousands of others who wage war against their society, either in the form of high-profile massacres or the daily grind of shootings around the country that barely make the local news. How do we go about this process of ""making sense,"" not as a way of excusing but as a path to understanding and preventing violence? We start by recognizing that many young Americans (and other young people around the world) develop and carry with them a kind of moral damage, which I have come to call ""the war zone mentality."" However it develops, they grow up with a damaged sense of reality. They view the world as if they are soldiers confronting a hostile environment that they perceive to be full of enemies. Once they get fixated on this damaged world view, they may hatch the delusion that even teachers and young children are their enemies. For Adam Lanza, apparently even his mother was an enemy who had to be destroyed. There is no one cause. It is as if they are building a tower of blocks, one by one, that can get so high it falls over, with innocent people dying. These building blocks can be found in a dangerous neighborhood or a school rife with bullying. They can be found through the Internet and mass media: the many, many web sites and videos that promote paranoid views of the world and validate violent action in retaliation. Thinking twice about violent video games . They can be found in pervasive and intense playing of video games, the hands-on virtual violence that desensitizes young people to proxy killing. These games become a psychological pathway to real killing by dampening impulses of compassion and altruism. They also come from a culture that supports access to lethal weapons: the crazy availability of guns like the Bushmaster semi-automatic rifle used by Adam Lanza that are, in effect, weapons of mass destruction when turned against children at school, or moviegoers in a theater or shoppers at a mall. These weapons have no place in civilian life. But moral damage and a misperception of reality usually are not enough to lead to murder. The typical killer is emotionally damaged and has developed mental health problems, perhaps exacerbated by being bullied and rejected by peers, or abused and neglected at home. He might be suffering from profound sadness, depression, despair, self aggrandizement and narcissism. The mental health problems that result from emotional damage require more, not less, social support, and not just from parents, who may be overwhelmed and ashamed of their offspring. The boys and young men can be socially isolated because their damage makes peers and the community turn away from them, and that only compounds their problems. Couple deluded thinking and rage with the rationale of the war zone mentality, and the result can be a boy or young man ready to kill, sometimes with horribly spectacular results. But this is more commonly seen in the ""routine"" killings that I work with as a psychological expert witness in murder cases across the country. Opinion: Get serious about mental health care . The crucial point is that even ""crazy"" people operate in a particular culture, a particular society, a particular time and place, and within a certain world view of how to manage your rage, your hurt, and your sadness. While not uniquely American (it has happened in recent years in Europe and the Middle East), the mass murder that took place in Newtown, Connecticut, is especially American. Our socially toxic culture promotes paranoia, desensitization to violence, almost unlimited access to lethal weapons, opportunities to practice mass murder via realistic ""point and shoot"" video games and games that justify violence as a legitimate form of vengeance in pursuit of an individual's or group's idea of justice. So what do we do? We can improve mental health services in schools and communities. Right now many parents are frustrated that there is nowhere to go with their troubled kids. We can work harder at getting kids to share disturbing information with adults with the confident expectation that those adults will help not punish and stigmatize. We can get behind efforts to rid our country of semi-automatic weapons and prohibit high-capacity ammunition clips for any gun. We can step up efforts to prevent kids from having access to the point-and-shoot violent video games. We can work harder at creating emotionally safe schools where bullying and rejection are antithetical to school spirit. One part of this is teaching boys that being compassionate and emotionally expressive is part of manhood in the 21st century. If we don't help, there will be more dead and wounded. It has become an American phenomenon. Only by getting close to killers and finding out what we need to do to integrate troubled boys and young men into society do we have any hope of preventing more carnage. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of James Garbarino.","James Garbarino: Violence that seems senseless to us makes sense to shooters .

"(CNN) -- The Department of Veterans Affairs said Wednesday it will apologize to veterans who were mistakenly told they'd been diagnosed with a fatal neurological condition. Brent Casey said went into a ""meltdown"" when he got a letter from the VA saying, erroneously, that he had ALS. Letters were sent August 13 to 1,864 veterans and survivors, the VA said in a written statement. They were supposed to be sent to veterans with ALS -- also known as Lou Gehrig's disease -- to keep them apprised of expanding benefits eligibility. ""According to the records of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), you have a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),"" said the letter, according to the National Gulf War Resource Center. ""This letter tells you about VA disability compensation benefits that may be available to you."" But some who received the letters, like Brent Casey, do not have ALS. Casey, a disabled Army veteran from the first Gulf War, told CNN that when he received the letter, he was ""just completely beside myself. Just floored. Went into a complete and total meltdown. I couldn't speak, couldn't -- I guess I was, truthfully, speechless."" The VA said issued a statement saying it made ""a coding error, and a number of veterans who should not have received this letter did."" An estimated one-third of the letters -- more than 600 -- were sent erroneously, a department official familiar with the program told CNN. After hearing from veterans who received the letter but do not have ALS, the VA immediately began reviewing individual claims files for all the recipients to determine who received the letter by mistake, agency spokeswoman Katie Roberts said in the statement. ""VA employees are personally contacting these individuals to ensure they understand the letter should not be confused with a medical diagnosis of ALS, explain why they mistakenly received the letter and express VA's sincere apologies for the distress caused by this unfortunate and regrettable error."" ""It's not right for it to happen this way,"" Casey said. ""Regardless if it was the case that I was diagnosed with ALS, that would be the worst possible way for an organization to let an individual know."" Upon receiving the letter, some veterans sought a second opinion outside the VA, according to veterans' service organizations, paying for doctors' consultations out of their own pockets. The VA said it will reimburse those veterans for the costs. In addition, the VA said it is reviewing its notification process to make sure a similar error doesn't happen again. The AmVets service organization is ""encouraged"" by the VA's response to the situation, and pleased to see they caught the error, said spokesman Ryan Gallucci.

"(CNN) -- A federal grand jury on Tuesday charged Paul Ciancia with first-degree murder in the fatal shooting of a Transportation Security Administration officer at Los Angeles International Airport. Investigators say Ciancia, 23, killed TSA officer Gerardo Hernandez and wounded two other agents and a passenger in what appeared to be an orchestrated assault on members of the federal agency responsible for airport security. He faces a total of 11 counts in the November 1 rampage, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California. Three charges based on the killing of Hernandez -- first-degree murder, violence at an international airport that resulted in death and using a firearm to murder and cause death -- carry possible sentences of life in federal prison or the death penalty. Prosecutors have not yet decided whether to seek the death penalty if Ciancia is convicted, the statement read. Ciancia, who was shot multiple times by police during the incident, is scheduled to be arraigned on December 26. He was released last month from the hospital and taken into custody by the U.S. Marshals Service. Relatives in New Jersey had received alarming texts from Ciancia before the shootings and raised concerns with local police, who had asked Los Angeles police to check on his welfare. Police missed Ciancia by ""a matter of minutes"" on the day of the shooting, U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, told CNN.

"(CNN)  -- Two Florida school administrators were due to appear in federal court Thursday to face contempt charges for saying a prayer at a school luncheon. Rep. Mike McIntyre is one of three members of the Congressional Prayer Caucus backing the school officials. Frank Lay, principal of Pace High School in Pace, Florida, and school athletic director Robert Freeman are accused of violating a consent decree banning employees of Santa Rosa County schools from endorsing religion. They face a nonjury trial before U.S. District Judge M.C. Rodgers. If convicted, they could be sentenced to up to six months in prison and fined, subject to sentencing guidelines. Defense attorneys have said it is it outrageous Lay and Freeman are facing prosecution for ""a simple prayer."" But the American Civil Liberties Union, whose lawsuit led to the consent decree, maintains students have a right to be free from administrators who foist their personal religious beliefs on them. However, an ACLU representative said the organization ""never suggested"" people should go to jail for violating the decree, and the organization is not involved in the criminal proceedings. The ACLU filed suit last year against the school district in northwest Florida on behalf of two Pace students who alleged that ""officials regularly promoted religion and led prayers at school events,"" according to an ACLU statement. Both parties approved the consent decree put in place January 9 under which district and school officials are ""permanently prohibited from promoting, advancing, endorsing, participating in or causing prayers during or in conjunction with school events,"" the ACLU said. Lay was a party in the initial lawsuit, and his attorney was among those approving the consent decree, according to the organization. In addition, the court required that all district employees receive a copy.

"Washington (CNN) -- With the approach of congressional elections and the midpoint of what he hopes will be his first of two four-year terms, President Barack Obama is honing a humor-laced stump speech that is part pep talk, part populist ideology. Obama delivered similar versions of the speech at six fundraising events this week, kicking into full campaign mode with calls to continue the progress made so far by his administration. His poll numbers are shrinking, and Democrats are resigned to losing some congressional seats in November. Amid unabated criticism from the political right and unyielding legislative opposition by Republicans, the White House wants to galvanize the liberal base and maintain support from independents vital to Obama's election but who polls show turning away. The basic premise of the president's stump speech message is that his administration inherited a mess after eight years of Republican leadership and needs more time to fully fix it while also positioning America to prosper in coming generations. Republicans complain Obama's repeated references to problems he inherited are intended to duck responsibility for what they call failures of his own policies that have allowed unemployment to remain high amid a sluggish recovery. Obama, however, insists that full economic recovery from such a deep recession will take years, and that his administration has so far laid the basis for continued improvement while addressing longstanding problems . He cites what he calls his main achievements -- reversing the recession, getting health care reform and Wall Street reform bills passed -- and touts energy reform proposals intended to greatly increase clean energy alternatives to make the U.S. industry globally competitive in the 21st century. Overall, though, the lingering message is that the GOP screwed up when in power, and now Democrats are making things right. Partisan rhetoric and jokes abound. In almost every speech, Obama says Republicans are counting on voter amnesia about GOP policies that led to the Wall Street meltdown and economic recession. He acknowledges some of his polices have been unpopular, particularly bailing out big banks and automakers. ""I actually have pollsters, so I know when things aren't popular,"" he said Tuesday at an event for Washington Sen. Patty Murray, repeating an oft-used line that always prompts laughter and applause. ""I know when they don't poll well. But I was not sent to Washington just to do what was popular. I was sent to do what was right."" Noting his campaign rally cry of ""Yes we can,"" he lampoons what he calls the obstructionism of congressional Republicans by dropping his voice into a kind of growl to mimic what he offers as their slogan: ""No we can't."" ""That's really inspiring,"" he deadpanned to laughter and applause at the Murray event. ""This vision they have for the future,"" Obama continued, pausing to add, ""Gives you a little pep in your step when you hear it, don't you?"" before adding a final ""No, we can't."" When he's really revved up, Obama shifts to the car-in-a-ditch analogy. Specific words change a little each time, but the message is unwavering: Republicans drove the American economy off the road through failed policies of tax cuts, deregulation and increased spending, and now his administration is getting it out of the ditch. With Obama, it's all in the delivery. ""They spent almost a decade driving the economy into a ditch,"" he said Tuesday, pausing several times as laughter erupted. ""And so me and Patty, and a bunch of others, we go down there and we put on our boots and we're pushing and shoving. And it's muddy and there are bugs and we're sweating and shoving, pushing hard."" The Republicans, meanwhile, are standing by ""sipping Slurpees"" and calling out ""you're not pushing hard enough"" and ""that's not the right way to push,"" Obama continued, pretending to sip a Slurpee to laughter and applause. ""So finally, finally, Patty and I and everybody, we finally get the car up on level ground. We're about to go forward,"" Obama said. ""And these guys come and tap us on the shoulder, and they say, 'We want the keys back.' "" He shouted over the roaring laughter to deliver his punch line: ""You can't have the keys back! You don't know how to drive!"" In recent weeks, Obama included an additional jab based on motor vehicle transmission symbols. ""You notice, when you want to move forward in your car, what do you do?"" he said Tuesday. ""You put your car in 'D.' When you want to go backwards, you put it in 'R.' "" With the crowd applauding, he declared: ""Back into the ditch. Keep that in mind in November. That's not a coincidence."" Along with the humor comes more stern rhetoric that depicts Republicans as the enemy of ordinary citizens. On Tuesday, he described the basic GOP philosophy as cutting taxes for ""millionaires and billionaires"" who don't need it, cutting rules for special interests, gutting regulations that protect clean air and clean water ""and things that most of us value,"" and then cutting ""working folks loose to fend for themselves."" ""So if you can't find a job or you can't afford college or don't have health insurance, tough luck -- you are on your own,"" Obama continued. ""Now, if you're a Wall Street bank or an insurance company or an oil company like BP, come on in, help us write the regulations."" The American people tried those policies for eight years under the previous GOP administration, Obama said, adding: ""And it didn't work."" ""It gave us record deficits and ultimately led to the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression,"" he said. ""Now, I bring all this stuff up not because I want to re-litigate the past,"" Obama said as applause erupted. ""I just don't want to relive the past."" Republicans, he said, are ""counting on the fact that you don't remember; that you're going to forget what happened when they were in charge for eight years."" ""So that's the choice in this election,"" Obama said. ""Do we go back to the policies that got us into this mess, or do we keep moving forward? I believe we move forward. America always moves forward.""","President Obama shifts to campaign mode for the November election .

"(CNN) -- This month marks the anniversary of many historical milestones in the continuing effort to guarantee equal rights to all Americans. The 19th Amendment was ratified on August 18, 1920, granting women the right to vote. On August 28, 1963, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. marched for civil rights and delivered his clarion call for a more just America on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington. And, 45 years ago Friday, President Lyndon Baines Johnson signed into law the historic 1965 Voting Rights Act. That law has proved to be one of the most successful civil rights laws in our nation's history, extending to millions of Americans the right to vote and the opportunity to participate more fully in our democracy. In celebrating its 45th anniversary, we must also remember that passing the Voting Rights Act and other civil rights laws was no easy feat. After the Civil War, ratification of the 15th Amendment was supposed to extend voting rights regardless of ""race, color or previous condition of servitude,"" meaning former African slaves would have the right to vote. But that promise was left unrealized because state legislatures (especially the southern states of the former Confederacy) expertly circumvented the Constitution and used ""Jim Crow"" laws to ensure the continued disenfranchisement of African-Americans. Poll taxes, ""literacy tests"" and blatant threats of violence depressed voter registration rates in black communities. Blacks attempting to register to vote were often brutally beaten. Many were killed. Then came Bloody Sunday. On March 7, 1965, about 600 peaceful civil rights workers were marching from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. While attempting to cross the Edmund Pettis Bridge in Selma, these nonviolent activists were savagely beaten and bloodied by Alabama state troopers. The images of that brutality were displayed on TV and in newspapers throughout the country and around the globe. Those visuals are widely credited with shifting public opinion in favor of the nonviolent protesters and leading to the passage of the Voting Rights Act. LBJ (a Texan) and other national leaders showed amazing strength and courage by forging ahead with legislation that many in the South would have called an overreach of federal power. The civil rights movement awakened the nation's conscience. Passage of the act signaled a new era of voting rights in the United States, finally enfranchising low-income blacks. It introduced federal oversight of elections to eliminate intimidation of minority voters and arbitrary registration requirements. The law directed the Department of Justice to challenge states' use of poll taxes, and one year later, the Supreme Court responded by declaring such taxes unconstitutional violations of the 14th Amendment. Amendments to the Voting Rights Act in the 1970s introduced protections for language-minority citizens, and later amendments banned supposedly ""neutral"" voting regulations that had racially disparate effects. The protections contained within the act, a century in the making, finally gave force and effect to many of the hard-fought gains of the Civil War. The Voting Rights Act is directly responsible for the election of dozens of African-American House members and the formation of the Congressional Black Caucus. Today, African-American voter registration rates are approaching those of whites in many areas, as are the rates of Latino voters. I wonder how the 1960s civil rights marchers would be treated by today's new media: whether the powerful images they created through nonviolence could be edited to instead show a riotous crowd; whether nightly opinionated ""journalists"" could successfully portray them as mere lawbreakers. And, I wonder whether today's political leaders would have the same courage as those serving in 1965. Recall that it wasn't in Johnson's political interest to forge ahead on civil rights policies, but it was the right thing to do for the country. It seems doubtful that today's elected leaders would take such a stand, especially in light of the growing chorus of Republican lawmakers questioning the citizenship provision in the 14th Amendment. States today are also fashioning new ways to restrain voting rights. Georgia, for example, relies on outdated and inaccurate information to verify the citizenship status of Georgians registering to vote. The Department of Justice concluded that the program improperly harms minority voters. Rather than repair its program, Georgia elected to sue the federal government in hopes of continuing to use its flawed process. A heavily disputed law now on the books in Indiana forces voters to show government-issued photo ID, which is inconvenient and expensive to obtain, keeping many low-income people from casting a vote. Other states have enacted similar laws or have simply refused to comply with federal demands, perhaps betting that they are unlikely to face reprimand from an overburdened federal government. This year, an election administrator in Texas -- a state employee -- publicly mocked the Voting Rights Act's language minority protections, telling an audience that poll workers should simply speak in slow, broken English to Spanish-speaking voters. The administrator was fired. We know that the promise of equality enshrined in our Constitution, and brought to bear by the Voting Rights Act, falls victim even today to ideological skirmishes and petty politics. But honoring the anniversary of the Voting Rights Act means acknowledging these remaining challenges and committing ourselves to addressing them. Just as it was 45 years ago that when Jim Crow was the law of the land. The right of every citizen to vote is too fundamental to the health of our democracy to be wielded as a political cudgel or traded away in favor of other, fleeting interests. This month, as we stop to appreciate and celebrate the efforts of generations past, we know that our reach towards meaningful equality -- that goal that Justice Thurgood Marshall once called only a ""distant dream"" -- grows stronger with each voter registered and every ballot cast. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","Amendment passed after Civil War was supposed to guarantee former slaves right to vote .

"(CNN) -- The major portion of the area Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is attempting to control for the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria is the same place I called home for 16 months of my life. Commanding Multinational Division North during the ""surge"" in 2007-08 -- a command that required securing four of the five provinces ISIS now desires to occupy -- allowed me to study the geographic, cultural, infrastructure and political and economic complexities of northern Iraq. Anyone who supports fighting Baghdadi's ISIS in this area ought to be aware of the challenges the land and the people will present. During our time there, we countered Iraqi insurgents, elements of al Qaeda in Iraq, homegrown terrorist groups like the 1920s Brigade, Nashqabandia, Ansar Al Sunna and a variety of other gang-like organizations. During that time, I had more than 30,000 U.S. forces and a significant U.S. Air Force support element contributing to our operations. We also coordinated with an emerging Iraqi army (five divisions, 60,000 men in our area), Iraqi police force (about 40,000 men and a few hundred women in the various cities in the region) and a small and uncommitted Iraqi air force, with pilots training in helicopters and prop planes. The most important thing I learned is how tough it is to fight a determined enemy there. Another takeaway: To succeed, the government of Iraq must want to provide security in the area more than the United States does. The four Arab provinces in the area between Baghdad and the borders with Turkey and Syria are about the size of our states of Maryland, Connecticut, Vermont and New Jersey. Ninewa -- with Mosul as the capital city -- shares a 175-mile border with Syria; Ninewa and two other provinces have a 400-mile border with the three Kurdish provinces (also a part of Iraq but viewed by most within their borders as the autonomous Kurdish Regional Government). The Kurdish provinces, in turn, share a 200-mile border with Turkey and a 300-mile border with Iran. Four major rivers (Tigris, Euphrates, Diyala and Zaab) and two major mountain ranges (the now-famous Sinjar and the lesser-known but more mountainous Hamrins) break the landscape, which is mostly desert, palm groves and irrigation canals. There are 10 major cities (five of which are among Iraq's top nine in population), dozens of smaller towns and hundreds of mud-hut villages. More than 11 million people make northern Iraq their home; I would suggest that over 90% do not want ISIS in control. The land is diverse, and the culture is exceedingly complex. Though I studied this area for months prior to the deployment and then lived, traveled and interacted with the people in the area for over a year and a half, I still had difficulties understanding many cultural dynamics -- even with the advantage of State Department professionals, intelligence analysts from top three-letter agencies and cultural subject matter experts from universities and think tanks at my disposal. It will take more than just wanting to beat ISIS to win in this area. Tribes are critical in Iraq, and in the north, there are seven major tribal confederations and over 100 subtribes. While many believe the north is Sunni Arab territory, I found that while many tribes were indeed Sunni, a slightly smaller number were Sunni-Shiite mix, and some were exclusively Shiite. One tribal confederation -- the Shammars -- is on both sides of the Iraq/Syria border, they have subtribes that are Sunni and Shiite, and their members roam freely across this national boundary with more allegiance to tribal law than to government of Iraq authority. When we were in northern Iraq, we had evidence that some members of a tribe were assisting in smuggling weapons and foreign fighters from Syria into our area of operations. I would suspect they have provided the same service for ISIS. When growing and training the Iraqi army and police during our tour, we realized it wasn't enough to recruit individual soldiers or police for the force. We had to garner tribal support. It becomes obvious why the Iraqi security forces fell in the wake of ISIS advances: Since the central government in Baghdad did not meet the wishes of the tribal sheiks in the north, the leaders' calculation was that it was better to back those who would overthrow the government. All this gives some indication of the challenges new Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has in winning back the north from the grips of ISIS. Gaining tribal allegiance to support a government counteroffensive against ISIS is an issue al-Abadi understands; it took U.S. forces years to comprehend this critical cultural nuance. Tribal feuds occur due to clashes over resources in rural areas, control of economic sectors in cities, honor issues (promises of marriage) and crimes committed by members of one tribe against another. The Kurdish region is not immune from tribal loyalties: The Talabanis make up one major political party (the PUK); the Barzanis make up the other (the KDP). There has been much discussion of the importance of the control of Mosul Dam. But that is only one of many key infrastructure elements. The Bayji Oil refinery, the Kirkuk oil fields, the Mullah Abdullah Power Plant, the Ports of Enty at Rabbiya and Habur Gate, and key religious shrines like the newly renovated Shiite mosque in Samarra are also critical to the political and economic future of Iraq. Each is probably on ISIS's ""control"" list, just as the elimination of security forces and other religions is on the ""destroy"" list of this horrific organization. Controlling or destroying each will result in humanitarian disasters as ISIS broadens its reach. A more inclusive Iraqi government is currently forming, and hopefully it will gain momentum in addressing a nationalistic approach to countering ISIS. It will require many things: an Iraqi national will; a condemnation by sheiks and imams -- and other moderates in the Islamic religion -- of the horrors committed by ISIS; an Iraqi and Kurdish military adequately supplied and trained, centrally controlled and supported by the people and not used for sectarian purposes; help from its friends and allies in the region and beyond; and taking advantage of mistakes ISIS is increasingly making in its messaging campaign. Special operators designating key targets and U.S. air power dropping bombs will contribute, but ultimately only the Iraqis, including the Kurds, can turn this around.

"(CNN) -- Images of chimpanzees on television or in the movies depict cute, cuddly and smart animals. So it's no wonder that some people, perhaps those with exotic tastes, may seek them out as pets. A chimp comes up to the fence to inspect visitors at an animal sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Florida. Some chimp owners will even dress the animal in diapers and treat them like a doll or a child. But playing that way with chimps is risking lives, the president of the Humane Society of the United States said. Wayne Pacelle wants people to know that chimps kill in the wild. ""Their behavior, which is born into them, can come out even if you put the animal in a bed at night, even if you dress them up in a tutu. They are still wild animals,"" he said. Pacelle's organization estimates about 15,000 monkeys and other primates are living as either pets or in private zoos. ""As infants they are fascinating,"" said Beth Preiss, who directs the organization's Exotic Pet Campaign. ""But they grow up and become dangerous to manage."" Just how dangerous was demonstrated Monday when a pet chimp named Travis attacked his owner's friend in Stamford, Connecticut. When Sandra Herold couldn't pull her nearly 200-pound chimp off of Charla Nash, she tried to drive him away by stabbing him with a butcher knife and hitting him with a shovel. When that failed to stop the vicious attack, Travis' owner -- heard on a 911 tape -- asked the police to shoot the chimp in order to stop the attack. They did and Travis died of gunshot wounds. The victim of the attack remains hospitalized with extensive injuries to her face and hands. While being raised by Herold, Travis was treated like a member of the family. ""I cooked for him, I shopped for him, I lived with him, I slept with him,"" Herold  told WNYW. Preiss said she believes the only place primates should be sleeping is under the stars. ""When chimps are kept in captivity we think they should be kept in as natural environment as possible,"" she said. One of those seminatural environments for chimps raised in captivity is operated by the nonprofit organization Save The Chimps. The sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Florida, has several three-acre islands among 200 acres of wilderness  where 150 chimpanzees roam free. The chimps arrive from different types of captivity. Some are former pets, but there are also some descendants of NASA's space chimps and some chimps used in labs for medical research.  Watch what life is like for the animals at the sanctuary » . It is the former pets that have the hardest time adjusting, according to Jen Feuerstein, director of operations for Save the Chimps. ""We make them dependent on human beings for their survival,"" Feuerstein said. Travis was 14 years old when he attacked, six years older than the age chimps used for entertainment are usually retired. They are adorable as babies but ""when grown, they are seven times stronger than an adult human and capable of causing some very serious harm,"" Feuerstein said. Herold said she did not have a problem with Travis in the past. ""He didn't have anything but love until this freak accident,"" she told WNYW. Pacelle saw it differently. ""This is a perfectly predictable outcome of an inherently dangerous situation,"" he said. Police in Connecticut say Travis had acted out previously. The chimp, which was well-known and liked in the community, escaped in 2003 and ""wreaked havoc"" on the streets of Stamford for a couple of hours, said Stamford Police Capt. Rich Conklin. Pacelle finds it outrageous that some people raise chimps as pets. ""If the owners are stupid enough to allow this animal into their home, they shouldn't be allowed to jeopardize the rest of the community,"" he said. At least 20 states have laws that make owning a primate illegal. The Humane Society is asking people to support the passing of The Captive Primate Safety Act, which would prohibit interstate and foreign commerce for primates as pets. Preiss gave three reasons why chimps shouldn't be pets. ""One, (they're) too dangerous, two, they can transmit disease,"" she said, and third, ""they belong in the wild.""","Chimp owners who treat them like pets are risking lives, Humane Society says .

"(CNN) -- Huma, please say it isn't so. That was the overwhelming sentiment of women I chatted with on Facebook, Twitter and over e-mail after I heard reports that Huma Abedin, wife of embattled New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner, might partly blame herself for her husband's return to sexting. An Abedin family member reportedly told People magazine that she blamed herself, in part, for ending couples counseling last year and focusing on her newborn son around the same time Weiner got back to his explicit digital contacts with women. I checked in with women around the country, most of whom I interviewed last week about Abedin's decision to stick with her husband, to take their pulse. Weiner's wife: Should Huma stand by her man? ""What a sad thing to hear, that Huma blames herself, but it's not so unusual, is it?"" said Jessica Dukes, a mom of two and freelance writer in Brooklyn, New York. ""When relationships hit the rocks, doesn't everyone have those 'What did I do to deserve this?' thoughts."" Andrea Kristina says she knows exactly what Abedin is going through. She put up with her husband's infidelities for years, she said, and that battered her self-worth. ""When a woman's self-esteem is already low, and she is already so insecure, it is easy for a man like this to bend her thinking in a way that makes her feel as if she is the one who failed somehow,"" the divorced mom of a teenager said. ""For so long, that's how I felt."" Pam Selker Rak, a married public relations executive in Pittsburgh, said if she were Huma's friend, she'd tell her she feels terrible she is choosing to ""carry this burden on her own shoulders."" ""But this is not her burden to carry,"" she said. ""Her husband is an adult who made choices, and those choices resulted in actions that have impacted his family, his career and even himself."" Sources: Huma Abedin considered leaving Weiner last fall . Allison Kluger, a married mom of two in Palo Alto, California, believes Huma's ""self-blame stance"" is ""very generous."" ""I don't really believe that she believes this, but she is very brave in voicing that a relationship -- all the ups and downs -- involve two people,"" Kluger said. ""What saddens me, but does not make me think negatively of Huma, is that she seems to be making all the sacrifices to keep her family, her husband's career and her career together."" It is not surprising and very common for women to blame themselves when a spouse or partner strays, says Dr. Thema Bryant-Davis, a Los Angeles-based psychologist and associate professor at Pepperdine University. Women in these situations, says Bryant-Davis, are looking for hope, power or control. ""If I acknowledge I am powerless to stop his behavior, that is very disheartening,"" she said. ""If I can figure out what I did wrong, I can figure out how to fix it, and if you tell me that I didn't do anything wrong, then what do I do with that?"" Huma Abedin dines with Clinton spokesman . Bryant-Davis also said it can be very hard for a woman such as Abedin, who has been very successful in her career and is not accustomed to ""losing."" ""It can be very disorienting to say how is it that in every other area of my life, I've been able to achieve, and now in this area it looks like a failure,"" she said, adding the best advice for women who are in Abedin's shoes is to get individual counseling as well as couples therapy. Meg Watt, a married mom of two, says she knows plenty of people who have blamed themselves for their significant other's choices, and that she was also guilty of it in a past relationship. ""But either you live in denial of reality or you eventually face the facts in the situation: she didn't make him seek something outside their marriage. He did that all on his own,"" she said. We, as women, are wired to be fixers, Watt added. ""But the important thing is to realize that the only person who can 'fix' infidelity is the one who chose to commit it.""

"(CNN) -- When James Holmes' psychiatrist warned campus police at the University of Colorado how dangerous he was, they deactivated his college ID to prevent him passing through any locked doors. After a deadly movie theater assault a month later, the question of what else could have been done hung in the air. Papers released by prosecutors Thursday are allowing a peek into the troubled mind of the alleged Aurora theater killer. They roughly trace his path from abandoning psychiatric treatment to amassing guns, clips and nearly 1,000 high-caliber or high-power bullets. Dr. Lynne Fenton told university police that Holmes talked about killing people. The warnings didn't stop the spray of gunfire weeks later, on July 20, 2012, that took the lives of 12 people and wounded dozens more at the premiere of the Batman movie ""The Dark Knight Rises."" It is unclear what was done with Fenton's information. Eyewitness recalls the 'darkest night' He threatened his psychiatrist . Along with the collection of firearms that police turned up with search warrants prosecutors have released, they found a Batman mask, a movie ticket receipt and detailed photos of the theater. Holmes also had ""numerous photos"" of himself with his hair dyed fire orange. Fenton, who works on the medical campus, contacted police in June about Holmes, according to a search warrant affidavit. ""Dr. Fenton was advising that she had been treating Holmes, and that Holmes had stopped seeing her and had begun threatening her via text message,"" the affidavit said. Holmes mailed her a frightful package. Inside were $400 in burned $20 bills, a sticky note with an infinity sign, and a spiral notebook containing a placard. Written on it: ""James Holmes, Of Life,"" according to the documents. Despite her warning and on top of the torment she's already endured, Fenton could face more than a dozen lawsuits that blame her and the school for improperly handling Holmes' treatment. At least 14 people have filed legal documents indicating they are planning to sue the University of Colorado Denver and Fenton for negligence.

The prosecution documents released Thursday give a macabre portrait of the arsenal Holmes acquired before the alleged shooting: . -- Nearly 1,000 bullets or shotgun rounds; he had ordered at least six packages from Bulkammo.com at the end of June. -- Two semi-automatic pistols, one with a laser sight . -- An assault-type rifle . -- A shotgun . -- Multiple ammunition clips . -- A 90-round magazine . -- A magazine carrier . -- Paper targets . -- Materials to booby trap his apartment . -- Multiple cellphones and computers . -- Black army boots . -- A black coat . -- A black combat helmet . -- A gas mask .

"(CNN) -- The debate over the number of civilian casualties caused by CIA drone strikes in Pakistan is perhaps the most contentious issue in the often fraught U.S.-Pakistan relationship. On one side are US officials who assert that the strikes kill few, if any, Pakistani civilians. In June 2011, President Barack Obama's then-counterterrorism adviser John Brennan claimed improbably during a speech at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies ""there hasn't been a single collateral death because of the exceptional proficiency, precision of the capabilities that we've been able to develop."" Two months later, U.S. officials speaking on condition of anonymity told the New York Times that around 50 civilians had been killed in drone strikes in Pakistan since the 9/11 attacks. On the other side of the debate are Pakistani officials such as the country's powerful Interior Minister Rehman Malik, who asserted in 2012 that 80% of the people killed in drone strikes were civilians. Earlier this year, before he stepped down as Interior Minister, Malik told Pakistani reporters that the strikes had killed mostly women and children. Similarly, Maulana Sami ul-Haq, leader of the Pakistani Islamist party Jamiat Ulama-i-Islam (JUI-S), told crowds at a 2011 conference in Lahore that drones kill ""dozens of innocent people daily."" Now comes a leaked Pakistani government document that helps to shed light on some of the facts surrounding this debate. According to the internal Pakistani report, civilian casualties from drone strikes are much lower than has often been claimed in Pakistan, but they are also much higher than the U.S. government has asserted. The Pakistani government confirmed 10 civilian deaths in CIA drone strikes in 2009, according to the leaked official document obtained this week by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a London-based organization that tracks the strikes. The report also found that from 2006 through October 24, 2009, civilians made up a minority of those killed in drone strikes: 147 civilians in a total death toll of 742, or about 20%. That number is somewhat lower than the estimates of Western nongovernmental organizations that track the strikes. The New America Foundation estimates that up to 207 civilians were killed from 2006 to October 24, 2009, along with up to 198 people who were not identified in reliable media reports to be either civilians or militants. Oddly, the leaked Pakistani report left out four strikes that occurred in 2007. It also missed nine strikes from 2008 and 2009, in which between eight and 10 civilians were reported killed, according to the New America Foundation's tally. The leaked report is a welcome sign that the Pakistani government is making a concerted effort to confirm the identities of those who have been killed in U.S. drone strikes in the country's remote tribal regions that border with Afghanistan. Pakistani authorities have long denounced the strikes, out of concern that civilian deaths caused by drone strikes inflame the local population, bolster militant groups and violate Pakistan's sovereignty. The civilian casualty rate has declined steadily over the life of the CIA drone program as both technology and intelligence-gathering have improved. One civilian -- a 10-year-old boy -- has been confirmed killed so far in 2013, according to reliable media reports. In 2012, five civilians were confirmed killed, representing 2% of the total deaths. As the civilian casualty rate has fallen, Pakistani officials who oppose the drone strikes have turned more frequently to the argument that they violate Pakistan's sovereignty, regardless of whom they kill. Pakistan's new Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, told parliament in June that ""We respect the sovereignty of others and they should respect our sovereignty and independence. This campaign must come to an end."" As Sharif wrangles with the United States over the future of the drone program, a complete and authoritative official Pakistani tally of civilian deaths caused by drones would be a useful tool for those discussions. The leaked Pakistani report is a step in the right direction.","U.S. drone program is especially controversial in Pakistan .

"(CNN) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh dismissed his Cabinet on Sunday, according to Tareq Al-Shami, a spokesman for the country's ruling party, but has asked the officials to stay on until a new Cabinet is appointed. The move followed what sources said were the weekend resignations of two top Yemeni officials to protest a government crackdown on protesters that left 52 people dead last week. ""The Embassy of the Republic of Yemen hereby would like to express its condolences and heartfelt sorrow for the loss of innocent lives,"" read a statement released Sunday by the Yemeni embassy in Washington, D.C. ""The perpetrators of this heinous act will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law."" According to the statement, Yemen's chief prosecutor has launched an investigation into the shootings at Sanaa on Friday and is questioning 17 suspects accused of orchestrating the massacre. News of Human Rights Minister Huda al-Bann's resignation came from an official in her office who is not authorized to speak to the media and asked not to be named. A foreign ministry official told CNN about the resignation of Abdullah Al-Said, Yemen's ambassador to the United Nations. Al-Said was replaced by Abdullallah Yahya Alsalal, according to Yemen's embassy in the United States. The resignations came amid new signs of cracks in support for Saleh. Senior ruling party member Mohammed Abulahoum said Sunday that Saleh ""should seriously consider a good, safe exit strategy"" to ""prepare the foundation in Yemen for a good transfer of power from him to the next authority or president."" Abulahoum ""strongly"" condemned Friday's violence, and in protest, has withdrawn a plan he proposed to mediate between the president and the opposition. Members of Saleh's own tribe are also calling for him to step down, according to Yemeni ruling party officials who have asked not to be named as they are not authorized to speak to the media. Tens of thousands of people protested Sunday outside Sanaa University in the capital, eyewitnesses said. CNN was not able to independently confirm the size of the protests. Funerals were held Sunday for some of the people killed in attacks Friday, with bodies of the victims carried through the streets. In addition to the fatalities, more than 100 people were hurt Friday in clashes between tens of thousands of anti-government protesters and security forces outside the university, medical officials on the scene said. Saleh announced that a state of emergency had been declared, and he expressed his ""deep regret"" over the casualties. Witnesses said the clashes began after government supporters and anti-government demonstrators threw rocks at each other. Security forces shot into the air and then into the crowd; they also fired tear gas to try to disperse the crowd, witnesses said. Yemen has been wracked by weeks of unrest, with thousands protesting Saleh's government. High unemployment has fueled much of the anger among a growing young population steeped in poverty. The protesters also cite government corruption and a lack of political freedom. The president has said he will not run for another term in the next round of elections. He also has pledged to bring a new constitution to a vote by the end of the year and transfer government power to an elected parliamentary system.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's national security team has recommended the U.S. suspend hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Egypt over the Egyptian military's ouster of President Mohammed Morsy, U.S. officials said. The recommendation, officials said, was made in a ""principals meeting"" last week of the president's national security team, including National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Secretary of State John Kerry and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. The meeting was the culmination of months of debate within the administration about how to respond to the July 3 ouster of Morsy, Egypt's first democratically elected leader. The Obama administration has not labeled Morsy's removal from office a ""coup."" Such a designation would require a cut in all but humanitarian aid. The White House has said it was in U.S. national security interests to keep the aid intact, although it did delay delivery of some fighter planes. But after U.S. calls to the Egyptian military for restraint over the last month were met with a heavy-handed crackdown on Morsy supporters, Obama canceled a joint military exercise and announced a new review of U.S. aid to Egypt. Egypt rethinking who its 'real friends' are . That aid totals $1.5 billion a year, $1.3 billion of which goes to the Egyptian military. The rest is economic assistance, some of which goes to the government and some goes to other groups, although only aid to the government would be suspended and could be reinstated once a democratic government is re-established. Officials said Obama's advisers recommended that the cut in aid include all foreign military financing to the Egyptian military, except funding toward security in the Sinai Peninsula and along the Egyptian border with the Gaza strip. The Sinai has become increasingly unstable over the past year, with U.S. troops in the area monitoring the peace treaty with Egypt coming under increased threat. The officials said they didn't expect Obama to make a decision until after Congress votes on his request to authorize military strikes on Syria, which is not expected until next week. ""The president has not made a decision to suspend or terminate our assistance to Egypt beyond what the administration has already announced,"" said Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the National Security Council. ""The national security team continues to review all of our assistance to Egypt."" Intervening in Middle East turmoil: mission impossible?","The United States provides some $1.5 billion in aid to Egypt yearly .
Some military aid has already been halted .
The review of aid to Egypt came after that country's president was overthrown ."
"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Millions of Chinese netizens were prevented from accessing huge swathes of the Internet Tuesday, with many rerouted to a website owned by a U.S. company with ties to a group outlawed in China. The China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), a state-run department, blamed a ""malfunction in root servers"" that blocked access to top-level domain names in China such as .com and .net, according to a post on its Sina Weibo account, the Twitter-like micro-blogging service. Security analysts quoted by the official Xinhua news agency said this could have been the result of a cyber attack by hackers -- though this has not been proved. Dynamic Internet Technology (DIT) confirmed it owns the web address users were redirected to but denied any involvement. It said the company's IP address is already blocked in China so users would have been met by a blank web page. DIT President Bill Xia told CNN Wednesday that the Internet outage was likely caused by China's own web censorship system, more widely known by its infamous ""Great Firewall"" moniker, which controls access to content on the Internet inside China deemed unsuitable. China 'employs 2 million to police internet' ""Their DNS hijacking system is used to redirect visits to certain websites to the wrong IP address,"" he said. ""But this time it was likely a temporary misconfiguration that affected all domain names."" According to its website, the U.S.-based company provides a range of services including anti-censorship solutions and has worked ""to provide web access to forbidden sites for Internet users in China,"" with the Epoch Times, a newspaper run by the Falun Gong, listed among its clients.

"(WIRED) -- Jawbone's UP activity-monitoring wristbands have been failing at an alarming rate. Three review units have failed during Gadget Lab testing, numerous complaints of ""bricked"" units riddle Jawbone's user forums, and the clever health and fitness product currently receives just two out of five stars on Amazon.com reviews -- 41 different user reviews were complaining of 23 bricked devices as of press time. Today, Jawbone CEO Hosain Rahman issued a statement on Jawbone's website explaining the cause of the failures, and offered a comprehensive, perhaps unprecedented, refund program for anyone unhappy with his or her purchase. Apparently, problems with circuit board capacitors are to blame for the litany of units that have trouble keeping a charge, exhibit erratic data-recording behavior, or just plain stop working. Rahman's message to customers reports the following: . ""We've found an issue with two specific capacitors in the power system that affects the ability to hold a charge in some of our bands. We're also fixing an issue with syncing related to the band hardware. Typically, these issues surface within the first seven to ten days of use. The glitches are purely performance related and do not pose any safety risk."" When the wristband works properly, it records all your daytime footsteps, and later provides a visual report of your walking, running or hiking activity via a nifty iOS app interface. You can also set the band to give you ""Activity Reminders"" -- gentle vibrations on your wrist that compel you to get out of your seat and take a few steps. The UP system also offers nighttime sleep monitoring, providing rich visual graphs detailing periods of deep and light sleep. Well, that's how the UP system operates when working. In our experience with three different failed bands, problems ran a frustrating gamut. One band issued random vibrations (even though no reminders were set) and consistently dropped data before failing to keep a charge, and then dying completely. The other two bands simply exhibited syncing failures before bricking for good. In his statement, Rahman says that Jawbone has ""temporarily paused production"" of the bands, and will once again begin taking orders after the hardware's technical issues have been resolved. Jawbone's VP of Product Management and Strategy Travis Bogard told Wired.com, ""We will bring it back as fast as we can."" Jawbone is also offering a ""no questions asked"" refund program for anyone who's purchased an UP. Starting tomorrow and running through December 31, 2012, consumers who bought their UP bands from authorized retailers will be granted full refunds, and -- here's the big news -- be allowed to keep their bands. Consumers experiencing hardware problems can also continue to receive replacement bands through Jawbone's existing warranty program. In fact, someone can collect a full refund, as well as receive a replacement band as long as the band qualifies under warranty.

"(CNN) -- If you're still querying any economic freeze between Russia and the West, digest this line from VTB bank the day Europe's sanctions took effect: The European Union ""have gone against their own interests to do the bidding of their senior colleagues from across the ocean,"" the Russian financial giant said. That's a publicly-traded, Western-style bank bluntly calling European governments lapdogs of the U.S. It's not a statement likely to win Western business in the future. To be clear, these sanctions could never have been agreed by the divided, 28-nation bloc if 298 people had not been blown out of the sky over Ukraine. This is an unparalleled precedent set by the EU, a group that hardly ever agrees on anything of substance. It has now taken steps that will harm its own economy in order to stand up to Russia. The sanctions are tough, but have holes. France, for example, can still deliver a pre-paid Mistral-class warship to Russia. And the European branches of Russia's big banks can still operate as normal. But European companies are suffering. Adidas is closing stores in Russia in anticipation of deteriorating sales. Volkswagen and Renault have already noted a slowdown that pre-dates the sanctions. Industrial and engineering giant Siemens has said it sees a ""serious risk"" to European growth as a result of the sanctions. These companies are not complaining and are not taking sides. They are doing due diligence and telling their shareholders the rules have changed and they expect an adverse impact. In London, there is debate as to whether the city will suffer. Luxury homes, car sales, art and wine investment, private school enrollment and football teams have all benefited from Russian investments. I believe the city could see upside. The Financial Times has reported the numbers of Russians putting their children into posh private schools is soaring. The Times has reported oligarchs are contemplating suing the EU or the individual governments to remove them from sanctions lists, and the best place for that is London's High Court. Such cases will generate significant fees for London's lawyers and public relations firms. However, Russian firms contemplating listing on the London Stock Exchange may pause, out of caution investors could shy away. I do wonder if changing sentiment will generate the most long-term pain between Europe and Russia. More sectors could be hit as financiers fear future sanctions and retaliation from Moscow, deals could dry up and finance could flee. That, in turn, could put a chill on European firms doing deals in Russia even if they are is not impacted by sanctions. An economic cold wind, if not war, is certainly blowing through the financial capitals of Europe.

"Paris (CNN) -- French perfume designer Jean-Paul Guerlain was fined 6,000 euros ($8,000) Thursday by a Paris court for racist remarks he made during a French television interview. He was also ordered to pay 2,000 euros ($2,665 ) to each of three French anti-racism groups that brought the case. Guerlain was found guilty before Judge Anne Marie Sauteraud of making a racial insult, under a law dating back more than a century. Guerlain -- who is no longer connected with the company that bears his name -- uttered a racial slur twice during an October 2010 interview on France 2 about his career and the making of the Samsara perfume. The racial epithet was used as he was describing how he was inspired to create the perfume while trying to impress a woman. ""One day I told her -- and I still called her Madame -- 'What would seduce you if one was to make a perfume for you?' and she told me, 'I love jasmine, rose and sandalwood,'"" Guerlain recalled. ""And for once I started working like a (racial epithet). I don't know if (racial epithet) ever worked that hard,"" he said. He subsequently apologized for the remarks, which prompted protests outside the Guerlain boutique in Paris. Guerlain, which is now part of the empire of luxury goods giant LVMH, was a family firm for five generations, was founded in Paris in 1828 by Pierre Francois Pascal Guerlain. Jean-Paul Guerlain, born in 1937, is now retired. CNN's Anna Prichard contributed to this report.","NEW: Guerlain is told to pay $2,665 to each of three anti-racism groups that brought the case .

"(CNN) -- To all of you gun lovers, feel free to go buy your Glock, shotgun, hunting rifle, .22 pistol, .357 Magnum or any of the other guns at your disposal. But you do not need an AK-47. For some, it's too soon to discuss gun reform, a little more than one week after the mass killings in Aurora, Colorado. I disagree. Too many Americans are being killed by guns every day; this most recent heinous tragedy should not keep us from having a rational debate. Let me be crystal clear: I do not own a gun, have no desire to get one and don't begrudge anyone for having one. Keeping a gun for safety? No problem. You're a hunter? Knock yourself out. I've fired a submachine gun once -- at the FBI Citizens Academy in Chicago -- and it did nothing for me, so please, carry on. I absolutely and positively support the Second Amendment. Americans have the right to bear arms, but nowhere in the U.S. Constitution does it say that you must be able to bear any arms your heart desires. Opinion: Media can't ignore the killer . There is no reason the ban on assault weapons is no longer the law of the land. If you need an AK-47 to hunt, maybe you need shooting lessons. President Barack Obama was right when he told the National Urban League last week that ""AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers ... not on the streets of our cities."" The inability of the National Rifle Association to understand that is shameful and destructive. The group assumes that any reasonable restriction on guns is un-American and unnecessary. Well, it's wrong. Dead wrong. Opinion: Three who gave their lives . And the NRA is just as wrong when it opposes efforts to restrict drum magazines that can hold 100 rounds, such as the one the gunman in Colorado used to mow down moviegoers. Seriously, please offer me a reasonable and rational explanation as to why someone who isn't a law enforcement officer needs to fire off that many bullets? This is where common sense makes a ton of sense. Yes, people are the ones pulling the trigger, but our gun culture borders on the truly obsessive. Gun deaths here have reached epidemic levels, and too many of us have an out-of-sight, out-of-mind attitude. Enough with timid politicians afraid to offend the gun lobby. Enough with voters making the stupid and nonsensical argument that the government wants all of our guns. As a nation that trumpets being the best in the world, let's stop outdistancing gun deaths in Japan, China and England. If we want to lead, let's lead in changing directions when it comes to our gun culture. America's gun obsession is unhealthy, unwise and deadly. Delaying the conversation does nothing for all of us. It's time to stand up and lead, America. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Roland Martin: Gun lovers should be free to own shotguns, pistols and the like but not AK-47s .

"(CNN) -- It's unlikely commercial aviation stories in 2014 will surpass those of 2013 for pizzazz or significance. This is probably a good thing. Who could have foreseen the three-month grounding of the entire Boeing 787 fleet when we forecast events for 2013? We were only 16 days into 2013 when 50 787s worldwide were grounded following a battery fire on a Japan Air Lines 787 and a near-fire occurred days later on an ANA 787 flight. Boeing Co. ended the year with embarrassing, dysfunctional standoff with its largest union, the International Association of Machinists District 751, over where the 777X (successor to the popular 777 airliner now in service) will be built. In between these bookends were first flights of the Boeing 787-9, Airbus A350 XWB and Bombardier CSeries. The latter was an attempt by the Canadian firm to challenge Airbus and Boeing at the lower end of the mainline jet sector. And American Airlines and US Airways merged in December after negotiating a settlement to a surprise lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice (which sought to block the merger) creating what is widely regarded as the world's largest airline. By comparison, 2014 should be relatively quiet. That's not to say it won't be fascinating. Here's what we forecast for the major players in the year ahead. Consumers: More fees, tighter seats, ""connected"" flight attendants . Passengers will get more opportunities to connect with the Internet while in-flight, but at a cost, as airlines continue to seek more profits from ancillary fees. It's likely that a number of fees will rise in 2014: ticket change fees, on-board purchases and baggage fees being the biggies. More passengers in the United States will be able to apply for TSA Pre-Check, as that program expands. Previously, the program has been largely confined to frequent fliers invited in by the airlines and those who applied for and were approved for Global Security and Nexus programs. TSA Pre-Check allows passengers to keep shoes and jackets on, laptops and 3-ounce liquids packed and even pockets filled -- just like the pre-9/11 days. The ugliest projection for 2014? Tighter seating. ""Airlines will continue to reconfigure their aircraft with slim seats in super-snug seating configurations, in a bid to squeeze in more passengers and generate additional revenue,"" says Mark Kirby, founder of the Runway Girl Network website that tracks passenger experience. ""Yet, in parallel with this trend, carriers are also moving rapidly to offer the type of technology in-flight that will distract our brains from the pain, including providing power for our personal electronic devices, faster/better connectivity, wireless in-flight entertainment and, increasingly, personalized service from flight attendants who will be armed with 'connected' tablets."" Boeing: Preserve or obliterate its largest union? The U.S.-based multinational behemoth is expected to announce in January where it will build its new 777X. The decision may be of limited global interest (though Japan is bidding on building the wings), but it's a matter of burning interest in the United States, particularly in Washington State, Boeing's traditional base of manufacturing. Washington stands to lose upward of 27,000 direct and indirect jobs in the 2020 decade if the 777X is built outside the state. The location hinges on a January 3 vote of Boeing's ""touch labor"" union, the International Association of Machinists District 751. If members vote to accept a revised version of the contract offer they rejected by a 2-1 margin on November 13, the 777X assembly and wing production will be placed in the state's Puget Sound area. If not, the jobs could go elsewhere -- or the fuselage may stay in Washington with wing production at another site. UPDATE: In a stunning reversal of the November 13 vote, IAM union members on Jan. 3 voted narrowly to accept the revised contract. The vote was 51% to 49%. Members continued to object to the terms and conditions of Boeing's revised contact offer. They said it wasn't much better than the one rejected November 13 on a 67%-33% vote. But heavy pressure within and from outside the union, particularly from elected and civic officials in the Seattle area, and the fear of losing jobs in the long-term, appeared to be enough to sway the vote. By March, Boeing should announce where it will assemble the 787-10 -- expectations are for its plant in North Charleston, South Carolina. The 787-9 is in flight-testing, which by all reports is going smoothly. Boeing is currently scheduled to deliver the first 787-9 to Air New Zealand in June. Airbus: End of the line for A350-800? The European company's highly anticipated A350-900 aircraft began flight-testing just before the 2013 Paris Air Show and is proceeding smoothly. Officials claim the program is ""on track"" for first delivery to launch customer Qatar Airways in 2014, but the precise date has been a moving target. First it was mid-year. Then the company said September would be the magic time. Then delivery became November or December. More generically, officials say delivery will come in ""late 2014."" It's possible delivery could slip to early 2015. Whether it's late 2014 or early 2015 matters little, just so long as delivery doesn't slip beyond that. More interesting for aviation geeks is what appears to be the drip, drip, drip demise of the smallest family member, the A350-800. There are now just 61 in backlog, following the widely expected decision by the new American Airlines to swap merger partner US Airways' order of 18 A350-800s for the larger -900 model. Industry experts believe Airbus will continue to urge customers to swap to the -900 and formally or informally discontinue offering the -800 this year. This would be followed by a decision to launch a re-engined version of the popular A330, a model that entered service in 1994 and has sold more than a thousand planes. Problem is, the A330's older engines aren't competitive with the new technology power-plants on the 787 and the A350. A re-engined A330-300, with derivatives of the Rolls-Royce and GEnx engines used on the 787, would make the A330 much more competitive. Given its far cheaper price tag than the A350-800 or 787, this could give the aircraft life well into the 2020s. Bombardier: Huge expectations, precious little time to reach them . Traditionally operating in the shadows cast by Boeing and Airbus, the Canadian aircraft company will have to sweat a bit if it wants to steal some of the spotlight it bid for in 2013. This makes it one of the more interesting players to watch in the year ahead . Bombardier's CSeries aircraft made its first flight September 16. Since then, company officials have stuck with an aggressive entry-into-service (EIS) plan to follow within 12 months . Slower than expected progress on flight-testing and a test schedule largely discounted as too optimistic, however, have led most aerospace analysts to conclude that the aircraft won't likely see service until the first quarter of 2015. Maybe even later. Swiss Airlines, an early customer, is supposed to receive its first CS100 in February 2015, based on the current September 2014 EIS plan. Bombardier officials told a Swiss newspaper the company is now planning delivery in the summer of 2015 or even later, at least five months beyond projections. Bombardier is expected to give an EIS update on its 2013 year-end earnings call February 11. A new delay of six-to-nine months is expected to be announced. An EIS date slip from the original plan of December 2013 to mid-2015 (a period of about 18 months) would put the aircraft on a par with the A350's delays, but well ahead of the 3 Â½ years of delays for Boeing's 787.","The ugliest projection for 2014?

"(CNN) -- Theodore Wafer said he was sorry from the bottom of his heart Wednesday for gunning down an unarmed young woman on the front porch of his Michigan home, but a judge said ""mistake"" was the wrong word to describe a murder and sentenced him to 15 to 30 years in prison. Wafer, 55, looked down, his lawyer patting him on the back, as Wayne County Circuit Judge Dana Hathaway sentenced him for second-degree murder in the November shooting death of Renisha McBride, 19 -- a racially charged case because the victim was black and Wafer is white. Wafer had testified that he feared for his life when loud banging startled him awake in the early morning hours of November 2, 2013. He opened his front door and fired a fatal shotgun blast into the face of McBride, who prosecutors say was seeking help after a car accident. ""To the parents family and friends of Renisha McBride, I apologize from the bottom of my heart and I am truly sorry for your loss,"" Wafer said. ""I can only hope and pray that some how you can forgive me. ... From my fear, I caused the lost of a life that was too young to leave this world and for that I carry that guilt and sorrow forever."" Hathaway said it was one of the ""saddest cases"" she had ever presided over. ""I do not believe that you are a cold-blood murderer or that this case had anything to do with race or that you are some sort of monster,"" the judge said. ""I do believe you acted out of some fear but mainly anger and panic and unjustified fear is never an excuse to take someone's life."" Hathaway said she was confident Wafer was remorseful and would likely never commit another crime in his life, but that McBride came to his doorstep seeking help and lost her life. ""You made the choices that brought us here,"" the judge said. ""I don't know that you could ever use the word 'mistake' to describe a murder, and a person was murdered."" The defense had argued for a sentence of four to seven years, saying a longer sentence guaranteed that he would never get out of prison alive. But Hathaway said the sentencing guidelines were reasonable for the crime, giving him 15 to 30 years for second-degree murder and two additional years for possessing a firearm while committing the felony. Before sentencing, Walter Simmons, McBride's father, addressed the court. ""This man has ruined our family's life,"" he said ""There's not a day that goes by that I don't think about my daughter."" McBride's sister, Jasmine, said: ""Losing my sister was one of the most devastating times of my life. Mr. Wafer, your actions impact a lot of other people other than just yourself."" After Wafer was convicted in August, McBride's mother, Monica, described her daughter as a ""regular teenager"" who was ""well-raised and brought up with a loving family."" During his trial, Wafer testified feeling the floor vibrate under his feet from the violent pounding on his front and kitchen doors. He said he couldn't find his cell phone to call 911, but retrieved his Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun from a closet and opened the front door at a quiet moment. ""I was not going to cower. I didn't want to be a victim in my own house,"" he said. ""I drew first, that's how I see it."" McBride had a blood-alcohol level more than two times the legal limit at the time of her death and had smoked marijuana earlier in the evening, according to testimony. Witnesses said she crashed her vehicle into a parked car in Dearborn Heights, Michigan, just before 1 a.m. and wandered off disoriented and bloodied. Some three hours later, she lay dead on Wafer's porch. The incident sparked protest and was likened by some to the shooting of unarmed Florida teen Trayvon Martin in 2012. After the incident, Wafer told police he was angry and ""full of piss and vinegar"" when he opened the door that night, according to prosecutors. CNN's Lena Jakobsson contributed to this report.","Theodore Wafer sentenced to 15-30 years in prison for shooting teen on front porch .

"(CNN) -- Once again, a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed has sparked anger and controversy. A South African newspaper published Friday a cartoon depicting the prophet lamenting that his followers lack a sense of humor, drawing ire from the Muslim community and fear of reprisal attacks just ahead of the World Cup soccer tournament that is expected to draw thousands to South Africa next month. The cartoon by the acclaimed Cape Town cartoonist Jonathan Shapiro, who is known as Zapiro, shows Mohammed reclining on a therapist's couch and saying sadly: ""Other prophets' followers have a sense of humour."" Zapiro called his cartoon ""gentle,"" and said he was responding to ""Everybody Draw Mohammed Day,"" a Facebook event that encouraged people to flout the belief by devout Muslims that it is wrong to depict religious figures because doing so could lead to idol worship. Zapiro said he believes all faiths should be subjected to satire. No religious groups, he said, should be able to think they are above society and not respect freedoms afforded to people who live in democracies. He said there should have been more movement on this score since 2005, when a Danish newspaper first published a series of Mohammed cartoons that led to riots around the world. ""It's important that we assert those rights,"" Zapiro said. He said the irony is that the cartoon itself is about asking people to think twice before they get so angry. But despite Zapiro's intentions, the publication by the Mail & Guardian on Friday drew strong criticism in some Muslim circles. ""These are times that the enemies of Islam are intentionally causing events to provoke a reaction from the Muslims,"" said a statement from South Africa's Council of Muslim Theologians, which went to court to try to stop the newspaper from printing the cartoon but lost its bid late Thursday. The council said it was exploring legal routes to ultimately implement a ban on what it called ""hate speech."" Radio Islam discussed the topic on South African airwaves Friday. ""Muslims have been seriously offended by the publishing in the Mail & Guardian newspaper of a blasphemous cartoon by Zapiro,"" the station said. Mail & Guardian Editor Nick Dawes defended his decision to publish the cartoon. ""I understand that for many Muslims any representation of the prophet, no matter how innocuous, is offensive and I genuinely regret any offence that the cartoon may have caused those who hold this belief dear,"" Dawes said in an open letter published on the newspaper's website Friday. ""That regret does not, however, outweigh my duty to the principle of freedom expression,"" he said. Creators of the ""Everybody Draw Mohammed"" Facebook group say their idea stemmed from recent controversies surrounding the belief. At least two European cartoonists live under police protection after drawing Mohammed and, most recently, Comedy Central censored part of the animated show ""South Park"" because it showed a depiction of the prophet.","Cartoon shows prophet wishing for sense of humor .

"(CNN) -- Drew Magary is an angry guy -- or at least he plays one on the Internet. The Deadspin, Gawker and GQ contributor and sci-fi author has amassed a large, rabid fan base for his sharp, smart, acidic rants on subjects ranging from the coaching abilities of Bill Belichick and the uselessness of scab referees to his hatred of scarves and the punchability of Justin Bieber's face. He's got opinions. But all that ire and energy were of little use as Magary and his wife watched their prematurely born child cling to life in a neonatal intensive care unit as a result of a condition known as intestinal malrotation. Luckily, the youngest Magary survived, and the ordeal inspired the father of three to share his parenting experiences in a new memoir, ""Someone Could Get Hurt."" CNN spoke with Magary about the peaks and pitfalls of being a dad in an often dangerous world. An edited transcript is below: . CNN: There are a lot of dad stereotypes out there, from doofus to ""Father Knows Best."" Do they have any impact on you? Drew Magary: They suck. Dad is clueless, bumbling and useless, or he's a hippie who's trying to breast-feed his kid. That can dictate behavior that you think you're expected to live up to. CNN: Fear is a prevalent theme in the book. What's the difference in the fear you felt before and after you had your kids? Magary: Every guy thinks, ""The kid is here, life's not going to be fun anymore."" There's a dread of not having the world revolve around you. I'm over that, and I'm more than happy to be a lameass who goes to bed by 9 every night. Once you have kids, you have all kinds of other fears: the kid getting hurt, or worse. You fear that everyone is watching you fail -- that there will not be another human being at the playground who is a worse parent than you are. It's all very self-inflicted and self-involved. I get too concerned with looking like I'm doing a good job rather than parenting well. You have to get past that layer of self-analysis, and that's very hard in this day and age. CNN: How do you think the Internet has affected how people parent? Magary: Your mistakes, admissions and fears are much more public. In that way, it's very good because there's more information for you to draw on and parents to commiserate with. It's really important for parents to have an outlet. Every time I've gotten advice on parenting, it might not have worked, but at least I felt more secure, not completely helpless. The downside is that people are d****. On certain mom forums, people are very supportive -- you present a problem and people will rush in with answers. But then there's a news story about a mom giving her kid a vegan diet, and it's 300 comments about ""You're a horrible person."" It's all amplified: The judgment and the support are more out in the open. CNN: What did your own dad teach you about fatherhood? Magary: He's a good dad, but he's a different kind of dad. I always expect things to work out for me the same way they worked out for him. When I'm not as effective as he was, I get really pissed off and frustrated, and I feel like I'm failing him. CNN: Are you having parenting discussions with your friends who are fathers? Magary: No. When moms get together, they'll talk shop a lot. Guys just would rather talk about anything else -- sports or something. There really isn't as much help or sounding boards for dads. There's no one who is like, ""Hey, come here, I'll help out."" Guys won't sit down and open a handbook; you get it all from the mom. She'll read something or make you read it (and you read half of it). The other useful person is the pediatrician. Still, you can ask if your kid is barfing too much, but you can't really ask, ""How do I get my kid to listen?"" Modern fathers face new expectations . CNN: In the book, you shared a story of getting so frustrated with your daughter, you worried about what you might do. What did you take away from that? Magary: I reacted poorly. You feel so awful for being angry at your kid, and you can see the precipice that you're on. Down one avenue there's a nice relationship where you're mutually respectful of each other, and down the other is abuse or just antagonism all day long. It's terrifying to see that and visualize a future where the fighting never ends. I'm getting better at it. CNN: Is it hard to let your kids have free rein to screw up? Magary: I was allowed to go outside unsupervised when I was 8 or 9 and explore the way you're supposed (to). It's good parenting to let kids figure out things on their own. But it's more difficult now because the world is more dangerous. The Internet has lots of terrible s*** on it. My neighborhood doesn't have sidewalks, so it's not amenable to walking. There's Lyme disease in the backyard. It's not the safe meadow it used to be, so that makes it a little bit of push and pull. CNN: You're known in your writing for having very strong opinions about how things should be. Do you set that perfectionism aside at home? Magary: I do a pretty good job in real life about not having huge expectations of my kids going to X school, having X job or making X amount of money. That's very old-fashioned, and it's going away. The things kids say and do are unlike anything you'd think of, and that's the fun of being a parent. When it's not fun is when they're acting in a way that presents a problem you don't know how to solve. They're screaming their heads off for three hours, and you have this fear that they'll keep screaming forever. You're trying to get your kid to the bus stop, and really, they don't have to go if they don't want to. What are you gonna do about it? That's a terrifying thing to realize -- that only they have the control over what they're going to do, and you just have to try to guide them in the right direction. That's the difference between being a good parent and a helicopter parent. CNN: How do you pick yourself back up from a bad parenting day? Magary: I have a glass of wine and go to bed. When my wife and I know the day is going badly, we'll just cut our losses, go to bed at 8 and wake up with a fresh slate. It usually works. You don't usually get two bad days in a row. Of course, all the parents of teenagers tell me it gets worse. They all look shellshocked; it's terrible. CNN: When you were a teenager, did you think that manhood included being a dad? Magary: No, I was like any other guy, ""I'll get married when I'm 50 and I'm gonna make movies and snort cocaine. ..."" All guys are like that, and then they undoucheify. A lot of what we do at Deadspin is debunking the bro thing. Men should get more credit than that. When guys write to me, they have fears and hopes and imaginations. They're a lot more interesting psychologically than just being douche bags who want to go clubbing. CNN: Did you have a moment when you saw that transformation in yourself? Magary: Probably when my third kid almost died. I was more grateful for existence -- I wasn't quite the cynical ass I'd always been, and that's permanently the case now. CNN: What did facing that teach you about the kind of man and father you want to be? Magary: You can have kids and not fundamentally change -- you just get to do more stuff. People say they change your life, but you're still pretty much the same person, but walking around grumpy because you don't get any sleep. I'll still get frustrated with my kid when he's crying his ass off, but I'm happy he's here. I have a fundamental understanding of how ridiculous it is to be annoyed at him -- because I'm happy he's not dead. I tell my kids I love them every day. I hug them and kiss them and all that, probably more than they want. I'm not the stoic dad, where you're fighting for 50 years to hear your dad say, ""I love you"" once. CNN: What advice would you give to a first-time dad? Magary: Know when to walk away. Not from parenting, of course, but from meltdowns and conflicts. It's not worth it.

"(CNN) -- Last week I offered some eco-friendly cell phone tips for people looking to save energy when they communicate. So, today I'll add it's also worth noting that several manufacturers already offer solar cell phone chargers. Solar cell phone chargers aren't just greener. They're also a handy piece of emergency equipment, especially if you get stranded (at least, during the daytime) with no access to a working electrical outlet. Or if you're spending time outdoors (at your kid's baseball game or doing yard work), you can keep your phone available and ready without running down the battery. Examples include: . • iSun, which claims to be compatible (via adapter cables) with most feature phone and smartphone brands, as well as popular mobile gaming devices and media players. The company also offers a larger model for charging laptops. • Solio Classic, a compact model featuring an attractive petal-like design and a long list of compatible mobile devices. (CNET review.) • Solar iPhone glove, offered by GadgetTown.com. • The Monaco mobile phone solar charger. See review at The Cell Phone Junkie. Also, solar chargers are available for many cell phone accessories, such as speaker phones (for car use) or Bluetooth headsets. The blog 12-volt Solar Panels recently explained how solar phone chargers work and reviewed a few models. They note that small two-watt solar chargers need about three hours of direct sunlight to fully charge a typical cell phone battery; 18-watt models can do the job in about 30 minutes. Or: Why not charge your phone by bike? This year Nokia debuted a bike charger kit that works with Nokia phones. Inhabitat reports, ""The first bike-powered chargers will be made available in Kenya for around €15 [$20 U.S.] and then go on sale later this year worldwide."" If you like building your own gadgets (or if you own a bike but not a Nokia phone), MAKE explains how to build your own bike-powered cell phone charger. Even though it's not renewable power, AT&T's Zero Charger is worth a look. This device automatically shuts down when it's done charging your phone -- thus avoiding wasting energy via vampire power. Whenever you buy a charger for your phone -- especially if you use a smartphone, which often have highly sensitive electronics -- check the manufacturer's charging specifications for your phone carefully to make sure that a third-party charger isn't likely to damage your phone. Also check whether using a different charger might void your warranty. And of course, take a little time to research online product reviews, forum posts or other information from people with the same kind of phone as yours. What was their experience with the charger? Remember that any nonstandard product combination is likely to yield some bad experiences. But a pattern of bad reviews (or no comments, which could indicate something doesn't work) is a red flag.","18-watt solar chargers can charge a typical cell phone battery in 30 minutes .

"Paris (CNN) -- Paris is home to tens of thousands of Africans who have added the tastes, sounds and look of home to the city's cultural mix. The majority come from the Francophone North African countries of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, but there are also communities from Mali, Congo, Guinea, Senegal, Burkina Faso and across the continent. According to the 2009 census, the 1.9 million population of Paris includes 30,000 with Algerian nationality, 21,000 Moroccans, 15,000 Tunisians and 54,000 with other African nationalities. There are also many people who were born in Africa and now have French nationality, and French nationals with African-born parents. Many other Africans live in Paris without documentation and do not appear on official records. Watch video: African culture in ""City of Romance"" Samira Fahim set up an Algerian bakery and cafÃ©, called ""La Bague de Kenza,"" in the 11th arrondissement, or district, 17 years ago. Today it is busy with African and European customers, but it took time to establish a taste for the Algerian pastries it specializes in. ""Even though we were many Algerians living in France, it was hard to find Algerian meals in Paris at that time because we did not have a lot of tourists coming to Algeria,"" said Fahim. ""In those years, you could find plenty of Moroccan and Tunisian specialties because many tourists were going there on vacation and then coming back to France, but Algerian dishes were much harder to find."" Watch video: Algerian food with French twist . Fahim had to adapt her recipes to appeal to home-sick Algerians, but also to French tastes. ""We don't use too much sugar,"" she said. ""That's because we wanted to satisfy our European clients' requests. In Algeria those kinds of pastries are way more sugary. ""We also make up new pastries. Many kids used to ask us if we had anything with chocolate so we made up new chocolate pastries."" Fahim also had to trust in her choice of location to see reward for her work. When she first opened, few people ventured down her street because it was unlit at night and many people told her the cafÃ© could not survive. Today, it is a thriving neighborhood. Also on Inside Africa: Film shines light on Obama's Kenyan sister . Musician Djeli Moussa Conde is another bringing African culture to Paris. Conde, who came from Guinea nearly 20 years ago, lived his first four years in Paris without documentation. ""I arrived here with a visa that was quickly expired,"" he said. ""For four years, I stayed undocumented. It was a very, very difficult situation. I tried to cope with this situation and I got by thanks to music."" Conde found much of his inspiration in the Menilmontant neighborhood he settled in. ""I've always lived either in the 11th arrondissement, or in the 20th arrondissement,"" he said. ""I've always stayed in this area. This is an area where there is a lot of diversity, many different kind of music. ""When I say diversity I mean this mix of colors between Africans, Chinese, Japanese, Malians, Guineans, Senegalese, people from Burkina Faso ... you see we're all here. ""The music is coming from here. We're all mixing with each other. That's why I chose this district."" Also on Inside Africa: Brazil's thriving African culture . Conde specializes in playing the kora, a harp-like instrument, and describes himself as a griot, a storyteller who keeps tradition going through generations. ""Everything I have shared I have shared it through a song, with lyrics, with music,"" he said. ""It has always been like this. My father did it this way, my grandfather did it this way, my mum did it this way."" Thirza Vallois, an author and expert on Paris, showed CNN around the La Goutte d'Or neighborhood in 18th arrondissement, home to almost 200,000 African immigrants. She lamented the closure of Lavoir Moderne Parisien, a theater which for 25 years featured African musicians, some of whom went on to enjoy international success. ""It's so sad, the end of a venture that went on for 25 years,"" she said. ""This is the kind of place that Paris was flooded with. It would be the equivalent of off-Broadway for this community,"" she said. She said the theater was closing because gentrification of the area had made it financially unsustainable and that its owner was leaving France with his family. Though as one institution passes, others always find ways to continue their culture in this city. ""As Africans, we are foreigners in this country,"" said Conde. ""We always have to keep our own identity. Even though you mix with others, you will always keep your identity, you'll always be an African and you must not forget where you come from.""","Tens of thousands of Africans have made Paris home .

"(CNN) -- Ashton Kutcher's quiet romance with Mila Kunis has reportedly blossomed into an engagement. The former ""That '70s Show"" co-stars have never been shy about PDA since they began dating in 2012, but neither one has talked much about the relationship. Reps for both actors have been mum, with only a telltale photo of a diamond ring on Kunis' left hand to fuel speculation she and Kutcher will soon be tying the knot. But how did these two go from friends and co-workers to a couple? Here's a recap of the love story: . 1998: Kutcher, then 20, landed a role in ""That '70s Show,"" the Fox comedy about a high school kid growing up in Wisconsin during the late 1970s. Kutcher was the ditzy pretty boy Kelso, and Mila Kunis, at 15, was Kelso's on-again, off-again girlfriend, Jackie. At the time, Kutcher was in a relationship with a pre-""Mad Men"" January Jones, but working together definitely helped Kutcher and Kunis bond. The actress told People magazine in 2001 that Kutcher, a former model, was her first kiss. ""I was so nervous and uncomfortable,"" Kunis recalled. ""I had the biggest crush on him."" Kutcher, on the other hand, insisted in 2001 that he was the nervous wreck. ""She acted so cool. She seemed as if she'd done it a thousand times,"" Kutcher told the magazine. ""I was the one with the butterflies in my stomach. I mean, here's this little girl, and I have to kiss her. It was nerve-racking."" 2002: With ""That '70s Show"" turning both Kutcher and Kunis into household names, their private lives became the interest of the public. Kutcher moved on from Jones and began dating actresses such as Ashley Scott and the late Brittany Murphy. Meanwhile, Kunis struck up a relationship with Macaulay Culkin of ""Home Alone"" fame in 2002, and their relationship lasted for eight years. 2005: By now, Kutcher had fallen for Demi Moore, nearly 16 years his senior, and they wed in a private Kabbalah ceremony in 2005. 2006: As ""That '70s Show"" came to an end, Kutcher and Kunis had apparently forged an enduring friendship. When they were first spotted spending a lot of time together in 2012, Kunis' rep brushed off the romance reports by saying that ""they have been friends for years."" 2011: Kutcher and Kunis moved on personally and professionally after ""That '70s Show."" Kutcher had been trying his hand in films with romantic comedies such as ""What Happens In Vegas"" (2008), ""Valentine's Day"" (2010) and ""No Strings Attached"" (2011). In 2011, Moore released a statement she was ending her marriage to the star. ""It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that I have decided to end my six-year marriage to Ashton,"" she said at the time. ""As a woman, a mother and a wife there are certain values and vows that I hold sacred, and it is in this spirit that I have chosen to move forward with my life."" April 2012: The April following his separation from Moore, Kutcher and Kunis began spending a large amount of time together. They were seen dining out and going furniture shopping, and they reportedly went on a weekend trip. A ""Kutcher source"" wasn't surprised by the turn of events, telling People magazine that while nothing happened during ""That '70s Show,"" Kutcher ""was always talking about how beautiful she is. But she was with Macaulay (Culkin) for a lot of that time and also just generally gave off a not interested vibe."" Yet when ""Extra"" asked Kunis what was going on with Kutcher, the actress called the dating rumors ""absurd"" and said, ""A friend is a friend."" September 2012: At some point, these ""friends"" found something more. While Kunis insisted she was having a hard time finding a date in July 2012, paparazzi photos told a different story. She was seen kissing Kutcher in New York's Central Park that September, a month after the two were rumored to have taken a vacation to Bali and two months after they seemed very into each other at a wrap party for his Steve Jobs biopic, ""Jobs."" December 2012: As their relationship became more apparent, Kunis and Kutcher headed on a trip to his hometown in Iowa for the holidays. February 2013: While on Ellen DeGeneres' talk show, Kunis was visibly flustered when the host grilled her about her relationship with Kutcher. ""Have you talked to him at all? When was the last time you talked to him?"" DeGeneres asked. Kunis, failing to keep a straight face, replied, ""Um, you know, it's been, give or take, a couple minutes."" March 2013: Last spring, Kutcher explained his reluctance to talk about what had become a pretty obvious love affair. ""You know, I've learned the hard way how valuable privacy is,"" he told Elle magazine in its March 2013 issue. ""And I've learned that there are a lot of things in your life that really benefit from being private. And relationships are one of them. And I am going to do everything in my power to have this relationship be private."" November: Following rumors that Kutcher and Kunis were engaged in September -- which turned out not to be true -- Kutcher became officially single again. Two years after Moore initially announced their marriage had ended, Kutcher's attorney filed a document in court that made their final divorce settlement official. January and February: As cameras kept catching Kutcher and Kunis in the act -- they were seen kissing courtside at a Los Angeles Lakers game -- Kunis began to open up a bit more about their bond. In a February interview with Cosmopolitan magazine, Kunis described her ideal date night: . ""We have a thing called white T-shirt night, and it's when you wear jeans and a white T-shirt and you go on a date,"" she said. ""Nothing fancy, it's just something that you love to do.""","Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis are reportedly engaged .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak hasn't seen ""jOBS,"" the biopic of his founding partner that premiered Friday at the Sundance Film Festival. But in terms of how well the movie tells the story of Apple's heady early days, his review is already in. ""It's so awful and atrocious,"" said Wozniak, who said he got access to a copy of the movie's script. ""Unlike the way Steve and I really dealt with each other. ""I didn't want to have much to do with that movie."" The film, which stars Ashton Kutcher as Steve Jobs, has received early mixed reviews. Some critics said it portrayed an overly fawning image of Jobs, while others praised Kutcher and called it an appropriate, if inaccurate, homage to Jobs, who died in October 2011. Speaking Wednesday at Georgia State University in Atlanta, Wozniak said he's also watched a scene from the movie that was released online. In it, Wozniak says ""nobody wants to buy a computer"" as Jobs tries to convince him of the potential. ""Never happened,"" Wozniak said. He elaborated last week in an e-mail to Gizmodo: . ""Totally wrong. Personalities and ... the ideas of computers affecting society did not come from Jobs ... . His idea was to make a $20 PC board and sell it for $40 to help people... build the computer I'd given away ... . [H]e always saw a way to make a quick buck off my designs (this was the 5th time). The lofty talk came much further down the line."" Steve Jobs' diet lands Ashton Kutcher in the hospital . All that said, Wozniak thinks the movie might be fun to watch, comparing it to ""Pirates of Silicon Valley,"" a 1999 made-for-TV movie that aimed to depict the early days of Apple and Microsoft. ""If it's anything like 'Pirates of Silicon Valley,' wow -- that's going to be so popular,"" he said. ""It's the the fun part. The story's when we were young, just like [Facebook biopic] 'The Social Network,' that type of movie."" Perhaps predictably, Wozniak was higher on a Steve Jobs film being developed by writer Aaron Sorkin (""The West Wing,"" ""The Social Network,"" ""A Few Good Men""). Wozniak is a consultant on that movie, which will play out in three extended scenes, shot in real time, that depict Jobs at three product rollouts: the Macintosh, Jobs' non-Apple product NeXT, and the iPod. ""It'll have people like me backstage talking to Jobs and him ... doing his type of thing. I guess that's how it's going to be,"" he said. ""Very creative. A very different kind of movie."" In an hourlong chat with Mark Becker, president of Georgia State, Wozniak answered questions submitted by students via Facebook and Twitter. Some of his other points: . On advice to budding entrepreneurs: ""Believe in yourself. You don't have to win arguments. You don't have to prove to someone else that you're right. If you believe you're right ... that's what matters. You've got to follow what's in your heart. The second piece of advice is: How far you go in life ... it's how well-liked you are by the people you work with. That will determine how far you go up organization ladders and the like. Be nice to people. Don't be cutting them down. Don't be rude and all that stuff. That's my philosophy."" On whether he has ""a love affair with Siri"": ""I also have a love affair with Android sometimes."" Wozniak, who is no longer involved in the day-to-day running of Apple, has long said he carries around multiple smartphones and other gadgets by various companies. On tech patent wars: ""New innovators should not be blocked. There is some room for patents. We develop stuff and sometimes you come up with something very clever and, yeah, there is some room for that."" But sometimes, he said, patents are awarded for ""something that really didn't take a great mind to think of -- a little 2-year-old with a pencil would have come up with it, almost. That's a great problem because sometimes patents are used to inhibit innovation."" Sorkin: Jobs biopic will be told in three scenes .","Wozniak: Story in Steve Jobs movie looks ""awful,"" ""atrocious""
Apple co-founder says ""jOBS"" may be fun, but is far from accurate .
He's higher on Aaron Sorkin's rival Steve Jobs biopic, on which he's consulting .
Wozniak says too many tech patents are stifling innovation ."
"(CNN) -- An enthusiastic male voice announces the new haul -- a dozen fresh Disney-themed Kinder Eggs -- while a disembodied hand rotates a fully wrapped chocolate treat for the camera. The hand slowly peels the foil off the egg, cracks it open with a thumb and reveals the surprise treasure inside. It's Slinky Dog from ""Toy Story""! The video lingers on the plastic pooch for a few seconds, making sure to take in every angle, then repeats the process with each of the remaining Kinder Eggs. As far as popular videos go, it would seem to pale next to viral skateboard crashes, comedy sketches or music clips. And yet this video has been viewed more than 35 million times since it was posted to the FluffyJet channel on YouTube in 2012. Welcome to the world of ""unboxing videos,"" one of the many peculiar genres on YouTube, the Google-owned video hosting site where viewers watch more than 6 billion hours of video every month. The volume of unboxing videos has boomed in recent years. Easy to make and surprisingly hypnotic to watch, the videos have become a lucrative little corner of the Internet for the people who film them. The most popular unboxings are for expensive gadgets, like the iPhone, Xbox and PlayStation consoles. Competition for these views is fierce. Tech-news sites rush to post their own slideshows and videos of brand new Apple products being birthed from their high-end packaging. Companies have even started uploading their own unboxing videos to official YouTube channels, like this clip of the new Xbox One from Microsoft that has been watched more than 3 million times. Less well known are the secondary product groups, oddly specific areas where there is still plenty of room for YouTube entrepreneurs to stake their claim. Toys of all types are huge, including collectable figurines, Legos and Kinder Egg videos like those posted to the FluffyJet channel are hits. Makeup videos are a small industry unto themselves. There also are unboxing videos for blenders, Uggs, coffee machines and live reptiles. If you can buy it, there's probably an unboxing video of it. Since 2010, the number of YouTube clips with ""unboxing"" in the headline has increased 871%. Last year alone, 2,370 days, or 6.5 years, worth of unboxing footage was uploaded to the site. The traffic is coming from all over the world, with an uptick in recent interest from such far-flung places as India, Brunei, Sri Lanka, and Trinidad and Tobago. The people who post the videos are not just bragging about their latest purchases. They make money off ads displayed at the start of a clip or that pop up while they're playing. YouTube's payment system is complicated, but one unboxer said he can make $2 to $4 for every 1,000 views. Older videos don't necessarily fall off the search rankings, so a creator in it for the long haul can make more money as they add videos over time. Creators only get paid per ""monitized"" view. That means visitors have to actually watch enough of the video for ads to appear. To keep people from abandoning a video before they've seen an ad, the videos have to be engaging, well shot and more than just SEO-keyword spam. ""It just needs to be long enough and good enough for people to stay to watch the ad,"" said the unboxer, who preferred not to be identified to prevent competitors from moving in on his categories. He currently has more than 2,000 videos on YouTube. Unboxers look at Google Ad Words and YouTube search's auto suggest function to uncover popular search terms and name their videos accordingly. They might borrow the products, or buy and return them after the video is shot. Companies will even ship free samples to the more popular channels. To keep viewers engaged, unboxers often bring a unique style to their product category. Some put their own personalities front and center, turning their faces into a trusted brand that brings back followers. Others have a specific shooting style that might favor time-lapse style footage set to catchy music, or close-up shots that pan lovingly over the unblemished surface of a new product. In addition to pulling in search traffic, good unboxers can get large volumes of subscribers to their YouTube channels. Consistency and focus are key to luring in those repeat viewers, so some people will have multiple channels, one for each narrow category. ""If someone really cares about Kinder Toys and you also have chainsaws, they're not going to subscribe,"" said the unboxer. It's clear why enterprising people make the videos, but what compels so many viewers to watch an amateur video of some stranger they don't know opening a box? What would compel a viewer to subscribe to the all-coffee channel and binge-watch a guy unpacking coffee makers? One reason is purely practical. Unboxing videos offer an unvarnished and honest peek at commercial products. The glossy, heavily retouched images and videos companies share of their goods often vary from what's really in the box. People want to know what they're really getting, whether the product looks cheap or well made, or if there are more parts than advertised. It's research material for devoted comparison shoppers and collectors. Some people actually find watching an unboxing clip to be satisfying and enjoyable. As any kid on Christmas morning can tell you, the process of ripping open paper and figuring out what's inside a package is half the fun. (Some YouTubers take the thrill to its literal conclusion and post videos of themselves opening birthday and holiday presents.) FluffyJet's audience metrics say viewers are primarily adults between 25 and 44, half of whom are in the United States. Kids are the primary target for toy channels, and the videos are shot accordingly, with bright colors, quick cuts and chipper narration. Some viewers are parents who are playing toy-unboxing videos to entertain their children. The parents might not be able to afford all the toys, but their kids can watch the videos and dream. ""Toy unboxing videos are great because kids get to experience the opening just as if they were opening the toys themselves,"" said a FluffyJet spokesperson. ""As for surprise unboxing videos, it is a real mystery, literally. Kids seem to love the mystery of seeing what's inside the surprise and seeing all their favorite toy characters.""","""Unboxing"" videos are a growing and surprisingly lucrative genre on YouTube .

"(CNN) -- The young woman at the center of the Supreme Court challenge to the University of Texas' affirmative action policy was a good high school student, an accomplished musician and a frequent volunteer, according to information released by her legal team. When Abigail Noel Fisher filed the lawsuit challenging the rejection of her application to the school in 2008, she was a senior ranked 82nd in her class of 674 at Stephen F. Austin High School in the Houston suburb of Sugar Land, according the lawsuit she filed against the university. On Monday, in its decision on whether race-conscious school admission policies violate the rights of some white applicants, the Supreme Court affirmed the use of race in the admissions process, but made it harder for institutions to use such policies to achieve diversity. The justices' 7-1 decision threw the case back to the lower courts for further review. Fisher's academic record placed her in the top 12% of her classmates, and the school recognized her for academic excellence in each of her three years for scoring above 80% in all of her classes, according to the complaint. Student voices differ on diversity . She participated in math competitions and also was an accomplished cellist, according to her lawsuit. She was co-president of her high school orchestra and played in city and regional youth orchestras, according to the complaint. She was also an active volunteer, having worked with Habitat for Humanity, and used her musical skills to play holiday music at a nearby nursing home, among other efforts, the lawsuit indicates. She included those details in her application to the university, but was nevertheless rejected under a program for students who don't land in the very top tier academically. Such students are automatically selected for admission. ""I was devastated,"" The New York Times quoted her as saying in a story published in October, in what the newspaper said was her first interview since the university turned her down. Affirmative action under pressure . ""I dreamt of going to UT ever since the second grade,"" she said in a video interview released by her lawyers to bolster her case in September. ""My dad went there, my sister went there and tons of friends and family, and it was a tradition I wanted to continue."" Instead, she went on to study finance at Louisiana State University, where she graduated, according to The New York Times. She is working as a financial analyst in Austin, according to the newspaper. ""The only thing I missed out on was my post-graduation years,"" the newspaper quoted her as saying. ""Just being in a network of U.T. graduates would have been a really nice thing to be in. And I probably would have gotten a better job offer had I gone to U.T."" In the video interview released by her lawyers, she said she doesn't like any form of discrimination. ""I was taught from the time I was a little girl that any kind of discrimination was wrong. And for an institution of higher learning to act this way makes no sense to me,"" she said. Opinion: Keep affirmative action but reform it . ""If people say anything about me, I hope they say I didn't take this sitting down,"" she said in the interview. ""I didn't accept the process because the process is wrong."" Should affirmative action still exist?

"(CNN) -- A soldier trying to scare another soldier out of hiccups shot his comrade in the face, killing him, authorities said Tuesday. Both soldiers, joined by a third man, were drinking alcohol and watching football at the time of the Sunday night incident, authorities said. ""The victim had the hiccups. The suspect pulled out a gun to scare him in order to stop the hiccups,"" said spokesman Carroll Smith of the Killeen, Texas, Police Department. Pfc. Patrick Edward Myers, 27, was charged on Tuesday with manslaughter, and Justice of the Peace Garland Potvin set his bond at $1 million, police said. Killed was Pfc.

Young entered active duty in May 2011 and arrived at Fort Hood in October 2011, the Army said. Myers is a soldier at the base, as was Young at the time of his death, said Fort Hood spokesman Chris Haug. Police responded to a shooting shortly after 10 p.m. Sunday and found a man shot in the face and two other men at the residence, Killeen police said. Myers allegedly ""produced a handgun and while handling it in an unsafe manner, discharged the handgun striking the victim in the face,"" police said. Young was pronounced dead during the ambulance transport to Skylark Field, where he had been scheduled for an airlift to a hospital, authorities said.

"(Lonely Planet) -- The Bahamas. Seven hundred islands. Twenty-five hundred cays. Four days of vacation. What do you do? From Nassau to the Out Islands, here's our cheat sheet for the Bahamian best in exploring, imbibing and just plain loafing. 1. Kayaking & kiteboarding, Exumas . Hundreds of cays swoosh over a 120-mile span of crystal blue in the Exumas, a shimmering natural playground anchored by lonely coves and critter-filled reefs. Glide past palmettos and plovers near George Town or paddle to iguana-owned shores in Exuma Cays Land & Sea Park. Adrenaline junkies may prefer swooping the gusty banks by kiteboard. Lonely Planet: How to plan the perfect destination wedding . Visit www.starfishexuma.com and www.outislandexplorers.com for kayaking info, www.exumakitesurfing.com for catching air. Find need-to-knows for Exuma Cays Land & Sea Park at www.exumapark.info. 2. A goombay smash at Miss Emily's, Abacos . Miss Emily's Blue Bee shines like a bright blue gumdrop near the center of New Plymouth, a gingerbread town clinging tight to windswept Green Turtle Cay on Abacos. For decades, yachties and day-trippers have drifted into the Blue Bee for jug-poured goombay smashes -- the drink was created here -- and the easygoing charm of Violet Smith, Miss Emily's daughter. Tack your business card to the wall. Ferries depart the Green Turtle Ferry Dock near Treasure Cay ($15 roundtrip). 3. Diving with friends, Andros . Divers swap stories and lies at Small Hope Bay Lodge, Andros, where the only thing better than peering over the Tongue of the Ocean is talking up the adventure with friends. And everyone's a friend at this affable, family-owned retreat near Fresh Creek. With its home-cooked buffets, eco-friendly accommodations and laugh-filled happy hours, Small Hope serves up everything but the camp songs. 4. Junkanoo, Nassau . Christmas doesn't leave Nassau on lullabies and sugarplums. It parades out of town in a jostling blast of whistles, horns, drums, and cowbells that whirls down Bay Street in the wee hours of Boxing Day. In this brightly costumed celebration, which traces its roots to West Africa and plantation-era religious rites, neighborhood teams compete for prizes. If you miss the parade on Boxing Day, there's a second one on New Year's Day and a warm-up in the summer. 5. Stylish loafing, Harbour Island, Eleuthera . Roving roosters and sputtering golf carts are part of the charm in Dunmore Town, a chichi Harbour Island village where Wall Streeters, supermodels and kitesurfers come for the shimmering pink sand beach. Beyond loafing, requirements are few: lunch at Sip Sip, cocktails at Rock House and mingling at Vic Hum, where the basketball court doubles as a dance floor. Lonely Planet: Culebra vs. Vieques -- Puerto Rico's contrasting islands . 6. Aquaventure & aquariums, Paradise Island . Got the grownup blues? Hurtle back to your childhood with a 60-foot plunge, a bobbing river ride and a shark-encircled waterslide at the 141-acre Aquaventure at Atlantis, on New Providence. More than 20,000 exotic fish and sea creatures -- from orange Nemos to stately manta rays -- float past in the resort's vast-but-walkable network of tanks and lagoons. 7. Apres-snorkel at Nippers, Abacos . Mother Nature smiled when she created Great Guana Cay, a breezy isle floating just a few kicks away from the fish-and-coral treasures of the Great Abaco Barrier Reef. Nippers Beach Bar & Grill adds a wink to that smile with cold Kaliks, beach-shack conviviality and free use of its snorkel gear. The Sunday afternoon pig roast is a legend. The ferry to Guana Cay ($25 roundtrip) docks beside the Conch Inn in Marsh Harbour. 8. Pirate wanderings, Nassau . Governor Woodes Rogers may have expelled Nassau's pirates in 1718, but that doesn't mean they actually left. Engaging displays about parrots, peg legs and Blackbeard keep swabby legends alive at the Pirates of Nassau Museum while the 260-year-old Graycliff Hotel charms guests with swashbuckling tales of its buccaneer founder. A statue of Rogers stays vigilant from his pedestal in the middle of town. 9. Smith's Point Fish Fry, Grand Bahama . Every taxi driver on the island knows the way to the Fish Fry, a Wednesday night tradition at Smith's Point, east of Lucaya on Grand Bahama. Locals queue early for grouper, lobster and snapper, fried up Bahamian-style under a wooden shack by the sea. Trust us, everyone's here or on the way. Stick around for after-dinner dancing. 10. Friday-night jam at Elvina's, Eleuthera . First-timers always ask the same question: Where did all these people come from? Elvina's, a ramshackle roadside shack in lonely Gregory Town, lures 'em in from far and wide for short sets by native musicians and traveling pros. Who's here? Low-key locals, gregarious old salts, sun-baked surfers and, occasionally, Lenny Kravitz. (Elvina's should actually be number one, but we're hiding it here out of selfishness.)

"(CNN) -- Professor Raffaello D'Andrea isn't short of admirers for his autonomous flying robots and the amazing tricks they perform. Every week, he receives a flood of e-mails from excited people telling him how to use them, he says. ""Folks have contacted me about using them to deliver burritos and pizzas, paint walls, do search and rescue, monitor the environment, flying cameras for movies ... It's just endless,"" D'Andrea says. ""I'm not going to pass judgment on whether they are good or bad ... my role is to show people what is possible."" It appears those possibilities are growing by the day at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich) where D'Andrea leads a team of researchers at the Flying Machine Arena (FMA). Set up by D'Andrea five years ago, the arena offers a ""sandbox environment"" for testing a fleet of progressively acrobatic quadrocopters. In the beginning, these four-rotor machines learned to flip through 360-degrees, ""dance"" to music and even play the piano. Today, increasingly complex flight maneuvers are being attempted as quadrocopters work together to build a six-meter tall model tower and juggle balls and poles. It is an extraordinary and slightly befuddling sight to behold. Read: Billion dollar mission to reach the Earth's mantle . Quadrocopters are controlled by varying the relative speed of each rotor blades, or pairs of rotor blades to generate thrust and control pitch, roll and yaw. They've been around for a long time, says D'Andrea, but what's making them so popular now as a creative tool is the shrinking size and cost of technology. ""In order to fly these things you need gyros. Only recently have they become small, accurate, and cheap enough to put on these vehicles,"" he explains. The tiny motors driving each rotor are also extremely powerful and cheap now, he says, as are the batteries. Last month, ETH Zurich released video footage of their latest stunt showing a quadrocopter balancing a pole before tossing it to another quadrocopter which successfully catches and controls the pole. ""We tried various catching maneuvers,"" said grad student Dario Brescianini, who D'Andrea and a colleague supervised during the research, ""but none of them worked until we introduced a learning algorithm, which adapts parameters of the catching trajectory to eliminate systematic errors."" It took Brescianini around three months to perfect the move, D'Andrea says, but the infrastructure behind the FMA has taken much longer to build up. Draped in protective netting and crash mats, the FMA looks like a rather down-at-heal gymnasium on first inspection, but a closer look reveals a high-tech suite of equipment which is crucial to understanding how the ETH's quadrocopters fly. Atop the 10-meter cubed space sits a motion capture system (made up of eight cameras) which locate objects in the FMA at rates of more than 200 frames per second. The data from this indoor GPS system is sent to computers where custom-built software sends commands to the quadrocopters via wifi. Read: Scientists build human brain inside a supercomputer . ""Aerodynamics is a very complex phenomena to model properly. If we can create machines that learn and adapt what they are doing in aerobatics it pushes use towards more intelligent systems. It's a great research challenge,"" D'Andrea says. Within five years he expects to see a proliferation of flying machines being used in a variety of settings. There are already companies exploring flying vehicles for inspection and for humanitarian purposes. In the case of the latter, he points to the efforts of Californian-based start-up Matternet. Founded by Andreas Raptopoulos, the company have ambitious plans to build a network of autonomous vehicles delivering food and aid to inaccessible areas in developing countries. In between in his other projects at ETH Zurich, which include developing balancing cubes and actuated wingsuits, D'Andrea is also looking for ways to commercialize the university's innovations. He's currently in the process of starting a company which aims to maximize the potential of their quadrocopters in the arts and entertainment industry. If his previous forays into the business world are anything to go by then expect it to be wildly successful. In 2003, D'Andrea co-founded Kiva Systems, applying the knowledge learnt creating a team of soccer-playing robots at Cornell University. Read: Search for alien life on Earth . The company, which provides automated robot systems for warehouses, was sold to Amazon for $775 million in 2012. ""When we were doing RoboCup (an international robotics competition) it did not enter my mind that the learnings I would take from my students I had trained could be used to build a company like Kiva Systems,"" he says. ""Basically, my mode of operation is really to focus on creating things that have never been done before and push the boundaries of what autonomous systems can do. In the process, do great research and educate people on how to really make things work and the applications will come."" There seems no limit to what autonomous flying robots might be capable of in the future and their unstoppable rise is increasingly causing concern, particularly their use in espionage and warfare. Suppressing the technology is not an option though, D'Andrea argues. ""I'm a firm believer that if the military use this technology then it's just a short step away from everyone using it,"" he says. ""We don't want the technology to be misused. The starting point is that our governments don't misuse the technology. As a society, we should question how much of a role, if any, these robots have in warfare."" Efforts to outlaw weapon-carrying drones have been gathering speed and support in recent months. NGO Human Rights Watch published a report (Losing Humanity: The Case against Killer Robots) in November 2012 urging governments to pre-emptively ban autonomous weapons. Another campaign, ""Stop the Killer Robots,"" is being mobilized by the NGO International Committee for Robot Arms Control and is due to launch in April. Far away from the social and political debates about the misuse of drones, D'Andrea is just keen to promote his teaching philosophy and how students should approach learning. ""I think there needs to be more room for unconstrained creation. We need to provide ways for folks, especially at university, to push the boundaries of what technology can do without being concerned about the immediate commercial application,"" he says. ""We should be more concerned about fulfilling our dreams as children. What was it we wanted to do as children? We wanted to fly like birds. Well, why aren't we doing that?""","Raffaello D'Andrea heads ETH Zurich's Flying Machine Arena .

"(CNN) -- Cameron Diaz is feeling fearless. With her 42nd birthday approaching on August 30, the actress is dismissing Hollywood's obsession with youth and embracing growing older with pride and an eagerness to try something new. ""I like being 41. I love it,"" Diaz tells Esquire magazine in its August issue, on sale July 8. ""So much s*** just falls away. Fear, mostly. It's the best age. That's when a woman knows how to work things, or she doesn't care about that anymore. You just stop being afraid. You don't worry about what men think. You just don't worry that time registers anything awful."" Perhaps it's that perspective that helped lead Diaz to the July 18 comedy ""Sex Tape,"" in which she and Jason Segel play a couple who accidentally share a home video of their intimate moments for all to see. Obviously, neither Diaz nor Segel could be shy about showing some skin with a plot like that, but in fact, Diaz isn't just showing some skin. She's showing everything. ""It's a first for me,"" she says of the nude work in the comedy. ""But Jason (Segel) gets naked, too. It's just a part of the role. So I did it. I mean, you see everything."" While Diaz is still conquering career firsts, in her personal life she's content with where she is. When the topic veers toward her decision not to have kids, Diaz explains, ""it's so much more work to have children."" ""To have lives besides your own that you are responsible for -- I didn't take that on,"" the actress continues. ""That did make things easier for me. A baby -- that's all day, every day for 18 years. Not having a baby might really make things easier, but that doesn't make it an easy decision. ""I like protecting people, but I was never drawn to being a mother. I have it much easier than any of them. That's just what it is. Doesn't mean life isn't sometimes hard. I'm just what I am.

"(CNN) -- Texas Gov. Rick Perry's Twitter account sent a disparaging graphic of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg Sunday night. Less than an hour later, he followed up with a tweet calling the graphic unauthorized. The disparaging picture of Lehmberg was a graphic created by a conservative group, but she is a central figure in Perry's legal challenges. The potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate has been charged with two felonies, accused of coercion of a public servant and abuse of his official capacity relating to a veto threat over funding for a the state's Public Integrity Unit run by Lehmberg, who had been charged with drunk driving and refused to resign. At the time of the veto, the Public Integrity Unit was investigating the Texas Cancer Prevention and Research Institute. Democrats say the attempt to slash the unit's funding was in response to the CPRIT investigation as questions arose about payouts from the organization to Perry's friends. Perry's attorneys have called the claim a ""red herring.""

"(CNN) -- A Chinese town has been on lockdown since last week after a man died of the plague. Parts of the city of Yumen was sealed off by police after a 38-year-old man died in a hospital on July 16, according to state news agency Xinhua. He had contracted pneumonic plague. On the same day of the patient's death, a quarantine zone was set up, affecting at least 30,000 people living in Yumen city in China's northwestern Gansu province. The original quarantine period is set for nine days. The deceased had been in contact with a dead marmot, a small furry animal in the squirrel family, according to Xinhua. He had chopped up the dead animal to feed to his dog, reports the AFP. It is not known whether the dog became infected. The plague is a severe bacterial infection of the lung that affects rodents, some animals, and humans. Caused by the same bacteria that leads to the bubonic plague, the pneumonic type is considered more rare but more dangerous as it can be transmitted between humans through inhalation, without the involvement of animals. The China Daily said four quarantine sectors had been set up in Yumen and 151 people who had come into close contact with the deceased patient are under medical observation. None of them have reported any symptoms so far, according to Xinhua. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. says when plague is left untreated, all forms of the disease will rapidly progress to death. Antibiotics that fight the plague bacteria should be given to a patient within 24 hours of the first symptoms. The plague occurs in many places in the world today, including Africa, North and South America and Asia.","A middle-aged man died from pneumonic plague in China last week .

"(CNN) -- In ""The Internship,"" co-stars Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson share the screen with a somewhat demanding co-star: Google. The comedy, which hits theaters Friday, is about two middle-age watch salesmen who overcome career obsolescence and a complete lack of tech savvy to join Google's internship program in hopes of scoring a job at the giant tech company. Based on early reports, the movie is also a valentine of sorts to Google, which cooperated with the filmmakers to portray the company in an accurate and flattering light onscreen. Google's campus in Mountain View, California, is shown as an idyllic place where employees blow off steam playing volleyball (true), riding bikes (true) and enjoying delicious free food (also true). Google products appear frequently and favorably throughout the movie, co-founder Sergey Brin makes a cameo appearance, and the company's mission is unquestioningly depicted as doing good in the world. ""I think the reason why we got involved in that is that computer science has a marketing problem,"" explained Google co-founder Larry Page at a Google conference last month. ""We're the nerdy curmudgeons."" The filmmakers approached Google about making the movie after Vaughn was inspired by a ""60 Minutes"" segment on the Google campus, director Shawn Levy told Reuters. A Google spokesperson told CNN that the company saw the movie as a good way to expose people to the company's ""do no evil"" culture and get more students interested in technology and computers -- a field that faces a shortage of qualified workers. All those good intentions aside, ""The Internship"" is also an impressive piece of marketing. Google says no money was exchanged during the deal with the film's makers, but the company was nonetheless very involved with the movie. Google allowed the film's cast and crew to shoot for five days at the Googleplex headquarters, using 100 real Google employees as extras. The company also provided props and consulted with the director, actors and script writers on what it's like to be a ""Googler"" (a Google employee). The company also offered insights into its fabled summer internship program, which accepted only 1,500 candidates this year from more than 40,000 applicants. ""Over two years, we answered their questions about Google products, allowed them to see a Noogler (new Googler) orientation, had them speak with our internship programs team to learn more about life at Google,"" the Google spokesperson told CNN. Google also gave feedback on the script, including a request to remove a scene in which a Google self-driving car crashes. Google says it didn't mind the car being in the movie, but thought that scene wasn't appropriate because ""the product hadn't launched yet."" The filmmakers complied. Product placement . Most of ""The Internship"" was filmed not at Google but on the Atlanta campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology, where the film crew turned a shiny new student commons building into a replica of Google's California headquarters. Even so, the Google brand -- Gmail, YouTube, Nexus tablets and so on -- appears extensively throughout the movie. (Google Glass, the company's connected eyewear that's currently being beta tested, is not in the film.) Such product placement is increasingly common in Hollywood, which is always looking for ways to defray the escalating costs of film and TV production. Typically, there are two kinds of product placement: natural and paid. When a company pays to get its soda, car or website into a movie, the camera lingers on it lovingly for an extra moment. Think of the BMW car scenes in a James Bond movie or Peter Parker using Bing as his search engine in ""The Amazing Spiderman."" On TV, most of these more brazen product shots are usually thrown in for free as part of a larger ad buy deal. ""If [it's] blatant and obvious enough that it's taking you out of the story, there's a pretty good chance that was a paid placement,"" said Jon Holtzman, who was the director of worldwide brand marking for Apple in the 1980s and early 90s and started its product placement program. But brands don't always have to pay, especially when their name is as respected as Google or Apple. Natural product placement is a more casual arrangement, where a company loans its products free of charge in the hopes of getting some exposure. They might provide the prop master on a TV show with gadgets that fit with a character. It saves the prop department work because they don't have to get a legal team involved with clearing the rights needed to mention real brands, and it saves them money that would have been spent renting props. However, the companies have no say over how their products are used or worked into the plot. Apple has a very successful history with this kind of unpaid, natural product placement. In the '90s Sandra Bullock movie ""The Net,"" the good guys are seen using Apple computers, the bad guys PCs. In ""Forrest Gump,"" Tom Hanks' character is seen opening an envelope from Apple that contains a large check after his buddy Lieutenant Dan invests money in a ""fruit company."" Hollywood vs. reality . ""The Internship"" blurs the line between the two types of placement. Google didn't pay 20th Century Fox, but in exchange for its cooperation, the filmmakers gave the company some control over how its products were shown onscreen. Even when companies don't pay or have agreements that allow them to prescreen scripts or get final approval on how their product is depicted, it's usually in the studio's best interest to show a brand in a favorable light. ""They'll go out of their way not to say something bad about it because they don't want a lawsuit,"" said Holtzman, whose company, Eclipse Worldwide, specializes in natural product placement. ""It's sort of implicit that this stuff will not be seen in a negative fashion."" Even makers of 2010's ""The Social Network,"" a raw and often unflattering look at the origins of Facebook and its founder Mark Zuckerberg, worked with the company on some aspects of the film to sidestep lawsuits. Google didn't ask for any changes after seeing a final cut of ""The Internship,"" despite a number of deviations from the original script -- and the fact that it sometimes strays from Google reality. For example, in the movie the interns are separated into teams that compete in various contests -- including the mythical Harry Potter sport of Quidditch -- to win full-time jobs at Google. The company says this is not actually part of its real-life internship program. ""It couldn't have been more opposite than my own experience,"" said former Google intern Raymond Braun, who now works full time at the company. ""The whole competitive, mean-spirited facet of the Internship program didn't resonate with me."" In reality, the Google Internship program is less ""Battle Royale"" and more ""Oceans 11,"" with each intern a key part of a tight-knit, collaborative team. Even so, Braun told CNN he enjoyed the movie and thinks it accurately captures the excitement and passion of Google's employees. ""I think that's it really fun to see the place where you work depicted on the big screen,"" he said.","Google provides the setting for the new movie comedy, ""The Internship""

"(Rolling Stone) -- Jay-Z and Beyoncé can't trademark the name of their daughter, Blue Ivy, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has ruled, which means the Boston wedding planner Blue Ivy can continue to use the name. The superstar couple filed a petition to trademark the name ""Blue Ivy"" shortly after their daughter was born in January, seeking to reserve it for use as a possible brand name for a line of baby-related products, including carriages, diaper bags and baby cosmetics. Veronica Alexandra, who started Blue Ivy in 2009, filed her own petition to trademark the name, and the Patent Office ruling means she can use ""Blue Ivy"" for event and wedding planning and related marketing and advertising. Jay-Z and Beyoncé can use the name for other potential business endeavors. ""I knew this was going to be a bittersweet roller coaster,"" Alexandra, 32, tells Rolling Stone. ""If this wasn't going to work, I'd go after both of them. Like, 'Let's do it!' In my mind I had some protective rights. There's no way by way of being a celebrity they should have entitlement [to the name]. Shame on them."" Alexandra was initially surprised to learn the famous couple had given their child the same name as her company. ""I was really blatantly shocked,"" she says. ""I didn't think it was true because nobody names their daughter Blue Ivy."" Still, Alexandra, who named the company to convey romantic traditionalism, says the trademark dispute has been a blessing in disguise. ""For me it was a very large compliment,"" she says.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN)  -- My son Alden called me at work one morning recently. He wanted to know my thoughts about the word ""mankind"" and whether it's OK to use the term in an essay. So I blurted out, ""Not if you don't want to exclude more than half of the human race!"" Only then did I learn I was on the speaker-phone with other students in the principal's office listening. So I asked the boys in the room the question: ""Would you feel left out if you were referred to as part of 'womankind?'"" The answer was, of course, yes. With my son's innocent question, memories flooded back of all those times at work as a journalist in the newsroom when the male reporters were sent out on the big stories, but not the women. It reminded me of that same left-out feeling I had the first time I saw a ""Men Working"" construction sign on the roadside. The sign made me wonder where the women were. Why didn't they get those jobs digging ditches and waving orange flags in the fresh air? Sometimes there would be a woman on the job site. But you wouldn't know it from the sign. Now that women constitute fully half the work force, the signs and words that exclude them seem even more noticeable and incongruous. Conversations that omit one group or another have no place in organizations that value diversity. In the workplace, we try to steer away from terms that alienate certain people. Such sensitivity helps with little things such as office culture, retention, productivity and profitability. Plus, it's the right thing to do. Despite much progress, most women in business can still relate to being left out of discussions daily. It's most pronounced in male-dominated professions. ""When I read something that refers to everyone as 'men' -- that bothers me,"" says Valerie Weingrad, one of few women captains operating charter trips through the Greek Isles. Weingrad, who spent much of her career in the competitive world of sales for telecom conglomerates, became comfortable early on as an outsider. ""I'd be in a conference room with 15 guys. A lot of times I'd feel excluded cause it was the good ol' boys network. I don't take it personally."" Still, when the CEO asked, ""Gentlemen, what do you think?"" from the back of the room, Weingrad wondered ""What about me?"" Newell Rubbermaid's only female corporate officer can relate. In an interview with PINK magazine, Penny McIntyre said, ""During the 'warm-up' conversations before big meetings, all the guys will discuss some big game that happened last night or last weekend. It's not inclusive -- and not just to women who aren't into sports."" Just sharing stories like McIntyre's and Weingrad's raises awareness and shifts culture, even if just slightly. It's amazing how simply considering something like the words we use can result in change and greater inclusiveness. Not everyone sees the need: Forbes editor-in-chief William Baldwin for one. I remember him glaring at me across the table at lunch one day a few years ago in the Forbes dining room, saying: ""Cynthia, if it's a good stock price -- it's a good stock price whether you're a man or a woman. What difference does it make?"" It makes a big difference. What Baldwin and so many others miss is that when you don't speak directly to your audience, they don't hear you. That's why so many women tune out when stories and pictures of men, often only men, fill the pages of Forbes, or when network TV shows feature only male experts. Women will wonder, ""What about me?"" But does all this fuss cross the line of political correctness? Are we becoming overly concerned to the point of absurdity? Before answering those questions; consider this question. Is it absurd that while women now have parity in numbers in the workplace, they still lag far behind men in pay and position? And yet, we put up with this just as we tolerate language that undermines women. Historically, one can argue that words such as ""man"" and ""mankind"" were never intended to be sexist. After all, the word ""man"" comes from the Sanskrit ""manu"" which means human being. ""Mankind"" comes from Latin, 'homo' (human and humanity) meaning both male human and human being in general. Yet, English dictionaries, such as American Heritage define ""man"" first, as ""an adult male human."" And this is a common interpretation. Let's face it -- men aren't the only ones to blame here. Old habits die hard even for those with the best intentions. Growing up in Los Angeles, just about everyone, myself included, used the phrase ""you guys."" During one news interview on the ""Men Working"" signs issue, I found myself, saying, ""Well as you guys know ..."" Oops. Busted. We all make mistakes. Even the best leaders will lapse into familiar territory, resorting to language and behaviors they're used to. It happens. But the real test is this: When we use a particular word or phrase, will others feel ostracized? Of course in many cities across the country, you'll still see those pesky ""Men Working"" signs -- which, by the way, could jeopardize states from receiving Federal Highway Administration dollars, since the DOT requires that all signs be consistent with their 700-page manual. ""Workers Ahead"" is the accepted language. It may not be always possible to use inclusive language, but it's worth trying. Anyway, how hard is it to use the word ""humankind"" when referring to all people? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Cynthia Good.","Cynthia Good asked son, boys if they would feel left out if called a part of ""womankind""
Good's question was to show why women and girls might feel excluded by word ""mankind""
Words excluding females seem antiquated now that women are half the workforce, she says .

"(CNN) -- The jailed mayor of Hampton, Florida, resigned Tuesday as the embattled city of 477 residents fought to keep its municipal government functioning in the wake of a state audit that exposed rampant corruption and mismanagement. Barry Layne Moore had held office for just over a month when he was arrested in November in a sting operation in which he allegedly sold a single 30-milligram oxycodone pill to an undercover informant for $20. He has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial. Gov. Rick Scott suspended Moore shortly after the arrest. But state lawmakers, including Sen. Rob Bradley and Rep. Charles Van Zant, are pushing to dissolve Hampton, saying the city, notorious for its speed trap along U.S. Highway 301, is too corrupt to govern itself. The audit, released last month, found 31 violations of Hampton's city charter, as well as violations of state and federal codes and laws. The allegations included nepotism, sloppy bookkeeping, and failure to maintain records, withhold payroll taxes or insure city vehicles. The audit also found $9,000 in questionable payments to the city clerk, $27,000 in questionable charges on a city credit card and $132,000 charged to an account at a BP gas station and convenience store across the street from City Hall. The city has been given 30 days to show it can put its house in order. If the lawmakers are not satisfied that progress has been made, they will proceed in the state legislature with a bill to dissolve Hampton's city charter. Among the conditions the city must meet: All current office-holders and employees must resign. The police chief, city clerk, and water manager already have quit, as has one of the five city council members, who are paid $125 a month. Others are likely to follow. The City Council meets Tuesday night. Moore's letter was short and to the point, stating, ""I, Barry Layne Moore, being of sound mind and body, ask that you would please accept this letter as notification that I am leaving my position with the city of Hampton, effective immediately.""","Barry Layne Moore, the jailed mayor of Hampton, Florida, resigns after audit .

"(CNN) -- By now, all have heard the appalling news that storm researchers Tim Samaras, his son Paul and Carl Young lost their lives while studying the tornadic supercell thunderstorm that struck the Oklahoma City area Friday. Tim and Carl were my colleagues and seasoned meteorologists involved in TWISTEX, or Tactical Weather Instrumented Sampling in/near Tornadoes Experiment, whose mission it is to sample aspects of the environment near tornadoes. I've known them for years. I have been involved in storm research and/or the storm chasing community since 1985. In this 28-year span, there had not been a death, and I know of no injuries among meteorologists studying tornadic storms until now. It will be several days before the exact circumstances of this tragic loss become clear. But even before the storm that ravaged the El Reno and Union City, Oklahoma, areas occurred, many questions appeared in the media about storm chasing, or storm observing in the field. Storm chasing: Science, thrill-seeking or tourism? Reducing this issue down to its core, emergency management personnel complain that storm chasers are clogging roads and making it difficult for first responders to reach victims. This issue came to a head in Ellsworth County, Kansas, on April 14, 2012, as an EF4-rated tornado approached Salina. Whether it is true that storm chasers did indeed impede traffic in that and other cases, it's clear that the number of chasers out on the roads has dramatically increased in the last decade. And some of these people engage in foolhardy and dangerous behavior. The question is ""why?"" CNN Photos: Professional storm chaser . From my perspective, as a professor of meteorology, the term ""storm chasing"" means what it always has meant to atmospheric scientists who study storms in the field. It means interweaving meteorological reasoning and forecasting skills for the purpose of understanding severe thunderstorms in general, and tornadic supercells in particular. It's enough to say that the early forays of meteorologists studying severe storms in the field in the 1960s and 1970s continued into the 1980s and 1990s. Eventually, their missions split into two tracks. On the one hand, in the middle to late 1990s and early 2000s large National Science Foundation-funded projects such as VORTEX, or Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment; STEPS, or Severe Thunderstorm Electrification and Precipitation Study; TWISTEX; and others involved field efforts bringing many research meteorologists and instrument platforms into the field to surround tornadic supercells or severe thunderstorms. I was involved at a minor level in the first and more actively in the second. The second track relates to more of what I do as a meteorologist. Initially, I was drawn to study these storms because they happen in California, too. So, since I am a weather forecaster by training, what better way to understand how weather patterns contribute to the ingredients of severe storms than by immersing myself in a large ""inquiry-based"" personal research experience? In my case, bringing this knowledge of ingredients, burned into my psyche by having to forecast them, back to California has helped meteorologists there understand the patterns that are liable to produce favorable conditions for tornadic supercells. Other meteorologist chasers have their own set of predetermined goals in observing storms in the field. All of us are admittedly united in a fascination with these storms. Tornado chasers were researchers, not cowboys . What is important to note is that no matter what their mission, meteorologists studying storms in the field contribute to the storm-observing process. All my colleagues who do this have ways of contacting the National Weather Service quickly when tornadoes are forming. This has led to an increase in the warning time. For example, such observations were a key in preventing injuries and loss of life for the Greensburg, Kansas, tornado on May 4, 2007. In 1996, the film ""Twister"" popularized the notion of chasing storms to immerse oneself in a tornado's circulation. The film's chase teams were loosely based upon the fleets of vehicles called Mobile Mesonets in project VORTEX and the early chase forays by the National Severe Storms Laboratory and Oklahoma University. Except it was based upon a fiction: that meteorologists purposefully drive into tornadoes. That fiction, I believe, has combined with the trend in society for ""extreme"" behavior. This has encouraged literally hordes of nonmeteorologists -- many of whom who do not understand storm structure or behavior -- carrying cellular phone cameras into the field. This extreme behavior is exemplified by cable network programs extolling groups of chasers who drive vehicles that resemble the Flash Gordon/Emperor Ming the Merciless' spaceship into the path of tornadoes, screaming ""tornado, tornado."" What does this have to do with Friday's tragedy? There were many chasers in the field that day. A radar plot taken around 6:11 p.m. CT about the time that a multiple vortex tornado was on the ground shows dozens of red dots representing storm chasers or spotters or researchers who were reporting their positions. Undoubtedly there were many more. Most of the meteorologists I know who were out in the field that day are represented by the dots south and east of the storm circulation. Many of them contributed useful information to the National Weather Service in the form of eyewitness accounts of the tornado formation, that were not able to be detected by the weather service radars in the Oklahoma City area. Some of them were on instrumented vehicles that included mobile Doppler Radar that also contributed to the excellent warnings issued for that tornado. Most left the area when the storm's circulation got so intense that visibility became an issue. They also navigated away from Oklahoma City so as not to clog roads at commute time, or to contribute to the chaos that would develop there if a tornado went into that heavily urbanized area. In the coming days, we'll learn more about the decisions that Tim's group made that day. It could be that he took some calculated chances and was caught by the rapid northward motion of the tornado. It would be a double tragedy if his memory is besmirched by an assumption the he was seeking thrills or personal publicity. He wasn't. He was an active researcher contributing to our knowledge. But the fact remains that to emergency management personnel a chaser is a chaser, whether he/she is a meteorologist or not.

"(CNN) -- Reports of rapes, killings and other horrors are growing in the Central African Republic. Rights groups accuse security forces and militia gangs of torturing civilians as world leaders warn that the nation is on the verge of genocide. Here's a quick primer to get you up to speed on the escalating situation. 1. First things first: Tell me about the Central African Republic . The landlocked nation in central Africa is home to about 5 million people. It declared independence from France in 1960, and has since been under the leadership of Presidents or Emperors. Despite vast resources, including gold, timber, diamonds and uranium, it's among the poorest nations in the world. Lack of good governance does not help. 2. So why all the chaos? It started as anti-government resentment. A coalition of rebels named Seleka ousted President Francois Bozize in March, the latest in a series of coups since the nation gained independence. They accused the President of reneging on a peace deal and demanded that he step down. Months before his ouster, both sides had brokered a deal to form a unity government led by the President. But that deal fell apart as the rebel coalition pushed its way from the north toward the capital of Bangui, seizing towns along the way. Rebels infiltrated the capital in March, sending Bozize fleeing to Cameroon. 3. What happened after the President left? The nation plunged into chaos. Political turmoil raged. Looters hit the main cities. Violence became the order of the day. Aid agencies warned of a humanitarian crisis as fear of the rebels prevented critically injured patients from going to health facilities. An unknown number of people have been killed in remote rural areas that are too risky to access. Others have fled into forests. More than 400,000 people have been internally displaced, according to the United Nations. That's nearly 10% of the population. 4. Who's in charge of the nation now? After the President fled, Seleka named its commander, Michel Djotodia, as the new leader. He took over and integrated some of the rebel fighters into the army, analysts say. 5. Was this the nation's first instance of instability? No. Political turmoil is nothing new for the Central African Republic. About a decade ago, Bozize led a coup that deposed his predecessor. Though he later won elections in 2005 and 2011, he did not have full control of the nation. Rebel groups ran amok for years, especially in rural areas. In fact, four of the nation's five Presidents since independence have been ousted through unconstitutional means. 6. OK, the President left and the rebels got their wish. Why's the fighting ongoing? Some say greed is a factor. Ousted government officials have long accused Seleka of going after the country's vast minerals. Then there's the reprisal aspect. When the President fled, the poorly trained national army didn't stand a chance against the rebels. Rebels capitalized on the army's weakness and went on a rampage, human rights groups say. The list of horrors is endless: rape, torture, kidnappings, looting. To counter the attacks, vigilante groups formed. Reprisals led to more mayhem. The country descended into anarchy, and the United Nations warned that ""the seeds of a genocide are being sown."" 7. What role does religion play in the tensions? Good question. Seleka is a predominantly Muslim coalition, and as history has shown over and over, religious loyalties can breed contempt and escalate conflicts. In addition, the conflict has exposed years of marginalization and discrimination against the northern, predominantly Muslim population, the United Nations says. Left uncontrolled, militia groups are uniting along religious lines. Most of the vigilante groups fighting back are Christian, leading to sectarian violence. United Nations officials have warned that the violence between the Christian majority and Muslim minority now in power could lead to genocide. 8. All this is happening a world away. Why should I care? The Central African Republic is surrounded by countries struggling to emerge from years of conflict. South Sudan, Sudan's Darfur region, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Chad are barely stable. Any instability is sure to have ripple effects that'll be hard to ignore worldwide. The CAR is also believed to be one of Joseph Kony's hideouts. The United States sent special forces to the region last year to help hunt down Kony, the brutal leader of the Lord Resistance Army. In a sign of a potentially expanded role, the Pentagon recently said it's considering sending aircraft to assault the Kony militia. The chaos not only risks destabilizing the region; it could complicate the Kony mission. 9. What's the current government doing? The current President has tried to distance himself by disbanding Seleka, Human Rights Watch says. Djotodia, the President, has denied that his country is on the brink of genocide. ""I don't think there's a genocide, there's not even a religious war, all of this is made up, it's to manipulate, to manipulate the opinion of the international community,"" he told Reuters. He accused the former regime of fueling the rebellion. ""They want to create a religious war by all means possible,"" he says. ""That's what Bozize wants."" 10. What is the international community doing? Though world leaders have warned of mass atrocities if nothing is done, the response has been limited. Last month, France pledged to send 1,000 more troops to add to the 400 it already has there. The current troops in the nation, it says, are there in a noncombat mission to protect French nationals and help secure the airport in the capital. An African Union force is already in the nation. The United Nations has suggested its peacekeeping force should eventually replace the African-led mission known as MISCA. That potential force could number about 6,000 troops and 1,700 police personnel, the U.N. says. The U.N. Security Council meets Thursday to discuss sending peacekeeping forces to the nation.","A coalition of rebels ousted President Francois Bozize in March, plunging CAR into crisis .

"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- In the city of Donetsk, the devastation wrought by weeks of fighting between pro-Russia rebels and Ukrainian forces is all too apparent. And as the civilians caught in the crossfire sweep up the debris of their homes and livelihoods, they are hardened against a president they say is killing his own people. Alexander Omelyavenko, a Donetsk resident, told CNN, ""We are Ukrainian but they kill us, so we probably need our own country. Because these people in Kiev, they are not brothers for us."" Another resident, Victoria Khrushova, wiped away tears as she told how her family had been forced to hide from the shelling in cellars. ""We live underground. It was so hard for two weeks -- especially 27th, 28th, 29th -- but only today is quiet,"" she said. The husband of a 34-year-old woman killed outside a block of flats last Wednesday wouldn't talk to CNN, saying he was in shock. He made it down to the cellar with their small child but she simply didn't have time. A 50-year-old woman was killed with his wife. It's a story which repeats itself over and over in dozens of apartment blocks, with civilians being killed by the constant shelling around Donetsk. Windows are shattered, holes blasted in walls and blackened rafters which once supported the roofs of homes stand in bleak outline against the sky. The victims are the human face of a humanitarian catastrophe unfolding even as diplomatic efforts to curb the fighting plow on. The United Nations' refugee agency, UNHCR, said Tuesday that the number of people displaced in Ukraine by the fighting, particularly around Donetsk and Luhansk, had more than doubled in less than a month. While an estimated 117,000 had fled their homes as of August 5, the agency puts the number displaced as of September 1 at 260,000. UNHCR believes the actual number displaced is higher, as many are staying with families and friends and choose not to register with the authorities. Nearly 95% of those forced from their homes are from eastern Ukraine and most remain in the region, its report said. 'Be human... Stop this war' Donetsk, once-thriving, is now half-empty, shop fronts shattered and its railway station bombed. Its trauma hospital is filled with the civilian wounded who were unable to reach safety in time as the shells rained down. Medical teams treat market traders with shrapnel embedded in their legs or the broken limbs of pensioners too old or sick to run. ""There was one war and this is the second war. I was born in 1940 in World War II and I will probably die before this war is over,"" said elderly resident Valentina Sergeyevna. Valentina Popova, in the ward next door, has lost her leg and her arm to indiscriminate artillery shells. Switching to the Ukrainian language, she made a heartrending plea to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. ""We used to dance, sing, do everything in Ukrainian. Poroshenko, Mr. Poroshenko -- please listen to us. Why don't you understand your people? Be a man. Be human. Please stop your aggression. Stop this war."" Russia accuses the Ukrainian government of precipitating the humanitarian crisis by pursuing its campaign to regain territory seized by the rebels. Meanwhile, Poroshenko and some Western allies have said thousands of Russian troops are in his nation's east, helping the separatists. NATO members meeting this week in Wales are expected to create ""a very high-readiness force"" to deal with Russian aggression in Ukraine and other international conflicts, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Monday. European Union leaders are expected to decide on further sanctions against Russia over its actions in Ukraine by Friday, Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini said Tuesday. Lavrov: 'Let us sit down and talk' Though Russia has denied sending its troops to Ukraine, it has defended the rebels' action in the east. ""Washington and Brussels need to ask Kiev authorities to stop shelling the houses, schools, hospitals and so on because you leave militia with no choice but to stand up to protect their people,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said. ""Let's not ask militia to lay down their weapons and allow themselves to be killed."" Lavrov said negotiations, not threats, would help resolve the crisis between the two neighbors. ""Let us sit down and talk instead of threatening with sanctions and stubbornly making absolutely unrealistic demands of the militia laying down arms,"" he said. ""This is what the peace plan of Poroshenko is about."" The continued fighting means it's difficult for humanitarian workers to assess the full scope of the crisis, the UNHCR said in its report, while damage to roads and other infrastructure makes it hard to get aid in. As of September 1, some 2.2 million people remained in conflict areas according to the Ukrainian authorities, the agency said, many with limited access to food, water, and other basic necessities. ""In Donetsk, Makiivka and Gorlovka the regional authorities estimate there are 20,000 people with disabilities and needing help,"" it said. ""In Luhansk, residents have been without proper supplies of food and water, and dealing with electricity shortages and communications problems for a month."" The number of people using ""humanitarian corridors"" set up by the authorities to flee has dropped off since a number of civilians died in attacks, the UNHCR said. Statehood question? Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in March following the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych the previous month. Violence broke out in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions in April when separatist leaders declared independence from the government in Kiev. Since then, the conflict between the pro-Russia rebels and the Ukrainian military has killed more than 2,500 people, according to the United Nations. A Human Rights Watch report released Monday claimed ""unlawful government and insurgent attacks"" in and around Luhansk were contributing to rising civilian casualties. It cited a Luhansk morgue doctor as saying explosive weapons have killed more than 300 civilians in the city since May. HRW researchers spoke to more than a dozen people who had witnessed artillery, mortar or rocket attacks in civilian areas. ""Many of the attacks appeared to be indiscriminate, in that they did not or could not distinguish between civilians and combatants,"" the rights group said. ""Indiscriminate attacks violate international humanitarian law, or the laws of war."" A report last week by the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights documented ""a wide array of serious human rights abuses"" committed primarily by the rebel fighters. Violations have also been committed by members of the Ukrainian military as they try to recapture rebel-held territory, it said. Opinion: Fog lifts to show Russia at war .

"New York (CNN) -- It was the most vivid, and unexpected, confrontation of Wednesday's State of the Union address. It happened when President Obama said this: ""Last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests -- including foreign corporations -- to spend without limit in our elections."" In the audience, Justice Samuel Alito, President Bush's second appointee to the Supreme Court, could be seen shaking his head and saying, it appeared, ""Not true, not true."" Who's right? As for what the court decided in Citizens United v. FEC, Obama seems to be right -- mostly. In a 5-4 decision, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy and joined by Alito, the court held that corporations, labor unions and other organizations had the right under the First Amendment to spend unlimited amounts of money to influence the outcomes of elections. If a corporation now wants to saturate the airwaves for or against any candidate for office, including on the eve of the election, it now has the Supreme Court's say-so to do it. Obama was on shakier ground when he said foreign companies now had the same unlimited rights to participate in our elections. The court's opinion very carefully said it was not deciding the issue with regard to foreign entities. So the court may yet give the green light to these foreign companies -- but it hasn't done so yet. On the larger question of whether Alito should have expressed himself in this restrained but unmistakable way, I'm with the justice. Attending the State of the Union has always been an awkward duty for the justices -- sitting through these political addresses and wondering when it's appropriate to applaud or react. Gloves come off after Obama rips ruling . When the president is paying tribute to the armed forces, or making an otherwise uncontroversial point, the justices usually join in the clapping; when the point is more political -- like the one Obama made about Citizens United on Wednesday -- the tradition is for the justices not to react. But it's wise to remember that the justices are human beings, with strong views on many subjects, including their own decisions. When Obama was criticizing the court's work (as was his right), Alito had the right to react the way anyone would who had taken a shot in a high-profile setting. In my book, even a Supreme Court justice -- even at the State of the Union -- is entitled to grimace and mutter. (It is worth noting that Alito does seem to have an ax to grind with Obama. As a senator, Obama voted against Alito's confirmation, which the justice does not seem to have forgotten. When the President-elect Obama made a courtesy call on the justices shortly before his inauguration last year, Alito was the only member of the court not to attend.) Still, it's worth remembering who is likely to have the last word in this confrontation. In his speech, Obama went on to say about the court's opinion, ""Well, I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities. They should be decided by the American people, and that's why I'm urging Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps to right this wrong."" The president and the Congress can try -- but it is the court that will have the last word on evaluating whether any new law is constitutional. And Alito, who is 59 years old with life tenure, will likely be passing on the validity of laws long after Obama has left office. As Justice Robert Jackson said of the court many years ago, ""We are not final because we are infallible, but we are infallible only because we are final."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Toobin.","Jeffrey Toobin says a comment by President Obama led to an awkward moment .

"(CNN) -- The hostage situation at Nairobi's Westgate Mall has raised four fundamental issues. These are Kenya's thinking on security, its state of preparedness, state responsiveness and the regional security dimensions. Given the death toll, it is tempting to seek easy answers or adopt quick options, including perhaps withdrawing Kenyan troops from Somalia or scaling back Kenya's role in regional security matters. Kenya has no option but to remain the central cog in the struggle to restore normalcy in Somalia. There are historical reasons for this -- in addition to the fact that Kenyan defense forces are already entrenched in Somalia. For better or worse, history connects Kenya intricately with East Africa in ways that are difficult, if not impossible, to separate. Not only is Kenya the gateway to several East African countries, some of them are Kenya's main trading partners. Read more: Al-Shabaab breaks new ground with Nairobi attack . Somalia's security and political history have become a part and parcel of Kenya's socio-economic reality. As an ethnic group, Somalis are separated into five different nations in the horn of Africa. Kenya has citizens of Somali ethnicity living in its north east, a historically marginalized part of the country that at one point preferred an irredentist option. Kenya's poorly policed border with Somalia is over 600 kilometers long. Some Somali are concentrated in Eastleigh estate in Nairobi while many others have spread across Kenya for trade and related purposes. Given the Somali refugee population in Kenya, it is difficult to differentiate citizens from non-citizens with certainty. Indeed, since Kenyan defense forces entered Somalia in October 2011, north-eastern Kenyan towns have experienced the highest number of attacks from Al-Shabaab -- to which there has been minimal government response. Read more: How Al-Shabaab picks its targets . This complex regional story is apt for the current metamorphosis and connectedness of global terror networks. Over the years, terror networks have borrowed tactics across regions. Their attacks are increasingly synchronized and Al-Shabaab is no exception to this process. This means that the threat that faces Kenya is real and complex and withdrawal from Somalia is not an option. But can Kenya's response be different? The tendency in counter-terrorism action has been to borrow strategies from other places and deploy them locally. Kenya has borrowed extensively from the United States and relied on Uganda to mount a counter-terror programme in which security is thought of in military and defense terms. Here, the use of extra-judicial force is preferred and replaces intelligence and surveillance. Locally, the police still think of security as synonymous with secrecy. They therefore never mobilize communities as key pillars of intelligence gathering and community support for security provision. Kenya's main challenge is therefore to address the lack of a visible security strategy and/or policy framework. This was apparent in the state of preparedness (or the lack of it) and responsiveness to the attacks at Westgate mall. To be certain, Kenya's security establishment is well organized and impressively presented. The problem is the absence of a clearly articulated security vision and policy framework around which its citizens can collectively rally. Three layers of strategic response must pave the way toward a Kenyan strategy that can potentially deal effectively with Al-Shabaab. Kenya needs to think beyond defense or purely military approaches, to ensure coherent and better use of security apparatus, and to mobilize society around a unifying security consciousness. Read more: Al-Shabaab grew amid Somalia's lawlessness . Kenya's anti-terrorism plan is heavy with legislative action that anchors the military approach. This is important but hardly sufficient because there is an inherent danger in packaging security bills that polarize society into ""us versus them."" This is the problem that has stalked Kenyan's proposed anti-terrorism legislation. Civil society and political opposition have contended the proposed law contains provisions that might roll back hard won civil liberties and sanction the profiling of innocent people. This view had a valid basis given the arrest and rendition of people to Uganda where the anti-terror law is more draconian. But such extra-judicial approaches simply lead to a dead-end. The story of the Somali sketched above suggests there is obviously no place to chase ""them"" away to. Kenya needs to bring its citizens together to recognize security threats, to mobilize them into a common security consciousness and surveillance system that they trust and have confidence in. This will require intricate work. But Kenya will not be the first country to think in such terms. Other societies have lived through decades of terror and collectively mobilized to challenge it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Godwin Murunga.","Kenya shares a 600 kilometer border with Somalia and has many Somali residents .
Al-Shabaab blamed the presence of Kenyan troops in Somalia for its Nairobi mall siege .
Godwin Murunga says Kenya needs to unite its citizens around a visible security strategy .

"(CNN) -- The front-page headline put it plainly: ""MURDERERS,"" it accused in huge capital letters, trying to capture the national mood in the Netherlands during a time of grief and anger. Below the headline the paper printed a photo of scowling, heavily armed pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine, men who many believe fired the missile that brought down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, with support from Vladimir Putin's Russia. The Dutch government, to no one's surprise, is moving much more cautiously than the populist press -- too cautiously, in the opinion of many, who are taking to social media to demand more forceful action, echoing the words of U.S. President Barack Obama, who called Thursday's disaster ""a wake-up call to Europe."" Not usually known for impulsiveness, the Dutch are demanding that their government respond. No country lost more people on MH17. That puts the Netherlands in a position of moral leadership in the aftermath of the attack. With nearly 200 Dutch citizens on board, it seems almost everyone in the Netherlands has a connection to a passenger on the plane. In a nation of travelers, everyone feels it could have been them or one of their loved ones. The flags across the country are at half-staff as the magnitude of the loss begins to take shape: An entire family of six wiped away, a leading AIDS researcher, a senator and professor of jurisprudence, a member of parliament along with his wife and daughter -- one son had stayed behind. One of the most prominent among the Dutch victims was Joep Lange, former president of the International AIDS Society, and a pivotal figure for several decades in the fight against AIDS. He played a key role in developing the treatment protocols that helped HIV patients survive and in making treatment affordable for patients around the world. The majority of the passengers of MH17-- 193 out of 298 -- were Dutch. Who were the victims? At the crash site, a Dutch journalist posted photos of the horror. ""This probably hurts the most,"" he tweeted, showing a picture of an ""I love Amsterdam"" T-shirt resting on the debris field. One by one, the people of the Netherlands are hearing the names, learning the stories. One elementary school, St. Willibrord, announced the terrible news on its website: ""Dear parents and guardians, as you may have already heard, the whole Wals family was on the plane that crashed in Ukraine."" Similar announcements are appearing in many villages, in places of work and community centers throughout the country; pictures of youngsters setting out on vacation are surfacing, along with images of the wreckage from the Ukrainian field, the travel guides, the children's stuffed toys. Now that the names and faces of the victims are being made public, disbelief is giving way to outrage -- mostly targeted at Russian President Vladimir Putin -- along with frustration that the Dutch government is moving too cautiously because of economic concerns. Russia is the Netherlands' third-largest trading partner. ""I'm getting totally sick from the cowardly, spineless focus in business interest,"" said one online comment. Others, online and in private conversations, offered specific, practical ideas about how to respond. One suggested expelling the Russian ambassador. Someone else said the crash area should be secured by an international military force while investigators, Dutch and others, do their work. A Dutch physician who was a classmate of Lange, the AIDS researcher, told me she blames Putin for his role in backing the separatists: ""All diplomatic ties with Russia should be suspended until he has been brought to justice. ... This would not have happened if it weren't for him."" This, she said, ""is our 9/11."" Another, skeptical of her country's ability or willingness to act, said nothing will be done unless the U.S. takes the lead. Russia has been stirring trouble in Ukraine -- inside Europe -- for many months. Some of us have warned that things would get much worse and suggested economic trip wires, escalating sanctions that will go into effect if Russia makes more military moves. But Putin's bullying tactics have successfully instilled fear of retaliation, particularly in parts of Europe that use Russian gas to stay warm in the winter. The shooting down of a passenger airliner may now, finally, change the calculus. If this doesn't, what will? The Netherlands is not yet ready to indict the Russian president or the militias he supports, the separatist forces in eastern Ukraine. But Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte is growing visibly impatient with Putin, and he is undoubtedly feeling domestic pressure. Opinion: How MH17 disaster backs Russia's Putin into a corner . On Friday he vowed to find and punish the perpetrators. On Saturday, British Prime Minister David Cameron said he and Rutte had agreed it's time to reconsider Europe's relations to Russia. Later, Rutte -- clearly irritated with restrictions on access to the crash site and the ""utterly disrespectful behavior"" of the gunmen controlling the area -- said he had ""an extremely intensive"" talk with Putin, warning that time was running out for the Russian president to show he is trying to help. Each one of the 193 Dutch dead, as well as the 43 Malaysians, 28 Australians, and every single person who died in this atrocity, is a tragedy that shakes their families and their communities. It's a chilling reminder that global politics intersects with human lives, and can do so when and where we least expect it. The disaster puts the Netherlands in a position that goes against its instincts, but one that it cannot avoid. The Dutch are not warmongers. They are consensus-builders, methodical, averse to impulsiveness. The Netherlands has long hosted many international institutions. The city of The Hague is synonymous with international justice. Dutch cells hold war criminals on behalf of the international community, and courtrooms in the Netherlands are the scene of legal dramas over historic misdeeds. Surely, the Dutch Prime Minister would feel more comfortable following someone else's lead, voting along with other countries in some international body to condemn someone ""in the strongest terms."" But strong words and front page headlines are not enough when 298 civilians are killed in a passenger plane. This time, the Netherlands stands at the center of an affront against the civilized world. This time, the people of the Netherlands are demanding that their country stand up and acknowledge its role to fulfill. This time, the Netherlands has to lead -- and the rest of the world should urge it to set a course of firm action.","Nearly 200 of the MH17 victims are from the Netherlands .

"(CNN) -- U.S. boxing history reveals that it is a sport that has traditionally been the ""bluest"" of blue-collar athletic endeavors. It has always held out the promise -- despite the odds -- of advancement for young men with the talent and guts to succeed in an often bloody undertaking, beginning with the arrival of the Irish in the mid-19th century, and for African- Americans and the later influx of Jews, Italians and Hispanics, whether U.S.-born, from Mexico or from the Caribbean. Three of the earliest success stories in this history were men of Mexican-American heritage from Los Angeles: Solomon Garcia Smith in the 1880s; Joe Salas, the first Latino to medal in boxing in the Olympics, in 1924; and Bert Colima, Pacific Coast champion in three divisions during the 1920s. These men challenged the notion that Spanish-surnamed men were not good athletes with the physical capability and mental acumen to succeed in corporeal competition. In subsequent decades, Latinos continually proved themselves worthy in the boxing ring and on the baseball diamond, the football field, the basketball court, and elsewhere. Little by little, as economic and educational circumstances improved during the years following World War II, such athletes came to represent local communities, and a few competed at the professional level. While the world of sport did come to recognize talent of Latino participants, many female athletes continued to be shortchanged for most of the 20th century. In recent decades, the playing field has been leveled substantially, in part due to Title IX -- the 1972 law that increased opportunities for women in high school and college athletics -- and a series of court decisions. Still, there remain barriers -- economic, educational, familial, and cultural -- to increasing the percentage of Latinas participating in athletics. My recent work documents the struggles that young women confront as they seek opportunities to play soccer and other sports in Midwestern communities that have seen an explosion in their Hispanic populations in recent decades. Many of these young women are keen to share in the triumphs and joys of athletic competition on behalf of their hometowns. Some even aspire to earn athletic scholarships that assist their families in paying for college, but their hopes are often checked. Marlen Esparza, a Latina boxer vying for the Olympics, follows the tradition of other Latino athletes who broke barriers. They compete for their own success and glory, but also enter the boxing ring or take to the field for other Latinos who will never vie for professional titles. Their stories exemplify two key issues affecting our nation's future: first, the demographic transformation of small town America, and second, the role of sport as a vehicle to break down barriers between ""new arrivals"" and their neighbors. As Marlen Esparza and other Latinas gain acceptance in ""nontraditional"" sports, the path for young girls in small towns gets a bit easier. The success of Esparza at a national level demonstrates the possibilities that participation in sport can have for this generation. A chance to compete on the basketball court and soccer field can open entirely new social and academic prospects for young women. And by wearing the name of their school on their jerseys, Latina athletes are seen as local heroes who are accepted by the general populace. Just as Italian-Americans reveled in the triumphs of Joe DiMaggio and Yogi Berra, likewise it is conceivable that a greater sense of pride, acceptance, and community may result from Latinas bringing fame to their hometowns through their on-field exploits. Marlen Esparza is in the vanguard of what we can expect from Latina athletes in the future. Her successes will open doors for young women who will grasp the opportunity to compete in athletics and in our nation's classrooms. What could be more American than that? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jorge Iber.","Jorge Iber says boxing in U.S. has long been chance for advancement among immigrants .

"Rome (CNN) -- Scandal is threatening to eclipse the poignancy and pageantry of Benedict XVI's historic final days as pope. Vatican officials were already trying Monday to swat down unsavory claims by Italian publications of a brewing episode involving gay priests, male prostitutes and blackmail when news broke that Benedict had moved up the resignation of a Scottish archbishop linked over the weekend by a British newspaper to inappropriate relationships with priests. Benedict announced two weeks ago that he will step down as pope Thursday, becoming the first pontiff to leave the job alive in 598 years. Interactive: Where does the pope live? At 85, he said he was too old, frail and tired to continue on as spiritual leader of the Roman Catholic Church and its 1.2 billion followers worldwide. It was a stunningly unexpected announcement that left church scholars poring over Catholic law to answer such basic questions as when the pope's successor would be chosen and even what he would be called in retirement. But the scandals -- along with lingering questions about how the church has handled claims of abuse by Catholic priests around the world -- have dimmed the spotlight on Benedict's final days as pope. ""Clearly, prior to these scandals erupting, the cardinals had a long checklist of things they were looking for in terms of the new pope,"" CNN senior Vatican analyst John Allen said Monday, including finding someone to help spread the message of the church and inspire faith amid flagging practice of the Catholic faith in many parts of the world. ""But in the wake of everything that's happened in the last 72 hours or so, quite clearly a new item is on that list, which is they also want to make sure they pick somebody who's got clean hands,"" Allen said. Vatican reveals Pope Benedict's new title . Archbishop's resignation . The Vatican confirmed Monday that Benedict had accelerated the resignation of Cardinal Keith O'Brien, the archbishop of Scotland. O'Brien told the pope in November that he would resign effective with his 75th birthday, on March 17. But Benedict decided to make the resignation effective immediately in light of the pope's imminent resignation, the Scottish Catholic Media Office said. The announcement comes a day after a Sunday report by the British newspaper The Observer that three priests and one former priest leveled allegations against O'Brien that date back 30 years. The Observer did not recount details of the claims or identify any of O'Brien's accusers, but said one of the priests alleged ""that the cardinal developed an inappropriate relationship with him."" O'Brien did not attend Mass at St. Mary's Cathedral in Edinburgh on Sunday, but the Scottish Catholic Media Office told CNN that the cardinal ""contests these claims and is taking legal advice."" His accusers took their complaints to the Vatican representative in Britain and demanded O'Brien's resignation, The Observer reported. At the Vatican, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the church, told reporters that Benedict has been informed of the allegations. As late as last week, O'Brien appeared to be making plans to take part in the conclave, when the College of Cardinals gathers in Rome to pick a successor to Benedict. But in a statement in which he thanked God for the good he was able to do and apologized to ""all whom I have offended,"" O'Brien said Monday that he would not be part of that gathering. ""I do not wish media attention in Rome to be focused on me -- but rather on Pope Benedict XVI and on his successor,"" O'Brien said. Opinion: 'Gay lobby' behind pope's resignation? Not likely . Cardinal controversy . While O'Brien will no longer be involved in electing the new pope, another controversial cardinal's plan to attend is further taking focus from Benedict's final days in office. Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles is facing fresh attention for his role in the cover-up of sexual abuse by priests. Documents recently released as part of the 2007 settlement in a previous abuse case detail what Terry McKiernan, founder of the watchdog group BishopAccountability.org says is ""stark"" evidence of efforts by Mahoney and others to sidestep authorities investigating sexual abuse. He recently gave a deposition in a 2010 civil lawsuit filed in the United States by a Mexican citizen suing the Los Angeles archdiocese. The man alleges Mahony and a Mexican cardinal conspired to allow a priest accused of abuse to flee to Mexico, putting an untold number of children at risk. Mahony has denied the allegations. Two groups seeking to stop Mahony's participation in the election said Saturday they have collected nearly 10,000 signatures on a petition against his involvement. ""His participation in the conclave would only bring clouds of shame at a time that should bring springs of hope,"" said Chris Pumpelly, the communications director for one of the groups, Catholics United. Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests also worked on the campaign. Church law requires that Mahony attend, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles said. Father Albert Cutie, an Espiscopal priest who studies the Vatican, said it would be impossible to exclude every cardinal with a hand in the church's vast sex-abuse problem. ""Unfortunately, if you were going to tell me no one can go to the conclave who has part in any type of cover up, you would probably exclude every cardinal in the church, because unfortunately that's the way the church is operated,"" he said. Blackmail allegations . As if the controversies over O'Brien and Mahony were not enough, two Italian publications reported over the weekend that Benedict had decided to resign not because of age, but because of a brewing scandal over the blackmail of gay priests by male prostitutes in Rome. Benedict received a 300-page report in December detailing the possible blackmail, la Repubblica newspaper and the Panorama news weekly reported, citing an unidentified senior Vatican official and dozens of unnamed sources. The Vatican emphatically denied the allegations this weekend, with Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone criticizing a rash of ""often unverified, unverifiable or completely false news stories"" as the cardinals prepare for their conclave. Cardinal Velasio de Paulis, one of the men who will help elect Benedict's successor, called the claims ""guesswork and imagination."" ""There is no proof and these allegations only serve to create a climate of division that helps no one,"" he said. While no one outside the Vatican has seen the document that purportedly details the claims and Vatican officials have not confirmed it exists, Allen said such a claim is not improbable. ""To me that passes the smell test,"" he said. Retirement preparations . Amid the scandal, the Vatican still has a transfer of power to manage. On Monday, Lombardi said it remains unclear when the gathering of church leaders who will elect the next pope will begin. While Benedict issued an order Monday to allow the election to begin sooner than the 15 days after the seat becomes vacant mandated by church rules, the date for the election will be set by the cardinals when they first gather, Monsignor Pier Luigi Celata said Monday at a Vatican press briefing. It still must happen within 20 days of his resignation, the pope said. After his retirement, Benedict is expected to head to the pope's summer residence in Rome before eventually settling in a monastery in Vatican City. Church officials have said he will seek no influence over the election of his successor, or over management of the church. Among other issues, Vatican officials are still trying to work out what Benedict will be called in retirement. One suggestion is ""pontifex maximus,"" Celata said. The term can be translated as ""supreme bishop."" Vatican officials hope to have an answer next week, Lombardi said. Ben Wedeman reported from Rome; Michael Pearson reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Israeli military said its forces opened fire on infiltrators while on patrol along the Egyptian border early Tuesday, killing one of them. ""The suspects fired at the soldiers, who returned fire,"" a military statement said. ""Most of the suspects fled back to Egyptian territory,"" except for the one who died in the exchange. Egyptian security said the shootout involved three Bedouins smuggling tobacco into Israel. ""One armed Bedouin was killed by the Israelis close to Karam Abu Salem crossing ... in North Sinai after Israeli soldiers fired at the men,"" according to Gen. Saleh Al Masry, head of North Sinai Security, who also said two others escaped. Border incursions are not unusual along Israel's border with Egypt. In August, militants crossed into Israel from Egyptian territory to attack civilian targets. Eight Israeli citizens were killed in the attacks, which Israel has said were the work of a jihadist group based in Gaza. Responding to the attacks, Israeli troops killed five Egyptian border guards while in pursuit of the militants. The incident strained relations between the two governments, with Egypt suggesting it was recalling its ambassador in protest. After an investigation, Israel apologized in October for the deaths of the Egyptian policemen. A rare statement of regret was issued in the days following the shootings. The incident also follows this week's reopening of a an Israeli highway that runs along the border. The road had been closed for safety reasons since the August attacks. ""Wide-scale work was carried out in order to strengthen the defenses of the road,"" the Israeli military said. Following the revolution in Egypt and the subsequent increase of instability in the nation's Sinai peninsula, the Israeli government has accelerated the pace of construction of a steel border fence that will run the 260 kilometers (162 miles) of shared border. Originally proposed as a method of stemming the flow of illegal immigration into Israel, the $350 million fence is increasingly being regarded in Israel as a necessary defense against lawlessness and what Israel says is the growing influence of radical Isamist groups operating in the Sinai Peninsula. Construction is expected to be completed by the end of the year. CNN's Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report .","NEW: Egypt says three Bedouins were smuggling tobacco .

"(CNN) -- A 15-year-old Yemeni girl was burned to death by her father for ""communicating with her fiance,"" according to Yemen's Interior Ministry. The father, a 35-year-old man, was arrested Tuesday in a village in Taiz Province. The statement did not clarify when the girl was killed. The case, which activists are calling an honor crime, is once again highlighting the plight of young girls in Yemen, where child marriages and honor killings still happen. According to Human Rights Watch, more than half of all females in Yemen are married off before the age of 18. Leading child rights advocate Ahmed Al-Qureshi confirmed to CNN his organization, Seyaj, had been asked to investigate the incident, one he considered an ""honor killing."" Honor killings are a problem in Yemen, a deeply tribal and conservative country, Al-Qureshi said. ""Most incidents of honor killing take place in rural areas where tribal law is applied."" ""The government needs to deal with honor killing seriously,"" Ali Al-Bahri, a human rights activist, told CNN. Al-Bahri added that most honor killings in Yemen go unreported, ""and suspects are never punished."" ""Tribal culture and lack of government awareness campaigns are key to the continuous spread of honor killings,"" said Al-Bahri. A written statement on the Interior Ministry's website said police had told the ministry that ""the father committed this heinous crime against his daughter under the pretext that she was communicating with her fiancee.""

"Abu Dhabi, UAE (CNN) -- During the summer months, in the arid, subtropical coastal plains of the United Arab Emirates, temperatures rise to 40 Celsius plus -- while average rainfall is a desolate four inches a year. And yet, in the years since the discovery of vast oil reserves in the late 1950s, a forest of skyscrapers, luxury apartments, verdant green gardens and golf courses has risen from the sand. It's been made possible only with recourse to unimaginably large amounts of water. Indeed, at 550 liters a day, Emiratis consume more per head of population than anyone else on earth. ""It just evaporates very, very quickly,"" explains Ivano Iannelli, CEO of the Dubai Carbon Center of Excellence. ""Then when you add the lifestyle requirements -- the giant swimming pools; the cooling systems; the big gardens that need irrigating four times a day ... it goes some way to explain why the water consumption is so high."" With scarce native freshwater supplies, Iannelli says the oil-rich nation spends hundreds of million of dollars a year purifying coastal seawater. For a country that, according to OPEC, boasted over $74 billion crude-oil export revenue in 2010, the financial burden may seem relatively light. But the cost to the climate, says Iannelli, is certainly not. ""Desalination requires a lot of power ... we estimate that about four tonnes of carbon are emitted per million gallons of freshwater produced here,"" he says, with reference to the energy-intensive process of removing salt from seawater (see factbox). To put that figure in context, Iannelli says that the energy required to pump freshwater from underground (which, he says, is the most common source of drinking water in the West) typically produces just over 1.5 tonnes of CO2 per million gallons. Read related: From polluter to protector: The UAE's 'Green Sheikh' While large-scale desalination is not uncommon in those parts of the world where natural water resources are scarce -- such as Texas and Australia -- the UAE is by some margin, according to Iannelli, the industry's most active player. In fact, 50% of all the world's desalination takes place in the Gulf. The Fujairah desalination plant in Abu Dhabi has a freshwater generation capacity of 492 million liters a day, making it the biggest single producer on the planet, according to Iannelli, who notes that it ""totally dwarfs anything found in the West."" For Dr Mohammad Dawoud, of the Abu Dhabi Environment Agency, this spells trouble for the future. ""If we don't conserve our water ... I fear about our resources in the future for the next generation,"" he says. However, standing in one of the country's 30 solar plants -- overlooked by sand dunes on all sides, Dawoud tells CNN that he hopes that solar technology may eventually offer a viable alternative energy source to power the UAE's huge desalination needs. ""There are no carbon emissions while using photovoltaic cells to produce electricity -- then (we can) use electricity to operate desalination plants to produce freshwater,"" he predicts. But on this point Iannelli is not convinced: ""At the moment, solar panels are not fit for purpose in the UAE ... the dust and the sand in the atmosphere prevent (sun) rays from hitting the panels efficiently ... and the high temperatures also reduce performance,"" he says. ""For me, solar is not the answer."" Instead, Iannelli believes that the most practical solution is for the desalination process to become more energy efficient, in conjunction with an effort by the Emiratis themselves to curb their ""lavish"" water consumption habits. ""There is almost no regulation concerning water or power use, no minimum standards for water-consuming appliances ... and very few energy requirements for buildings,"" he laments. ""Whatever we do, from now on it has to be cost-effective, lean and clean.""","UAE consumes 550 liters of water per head each day -- more than any other country .

"(CNN) -- Here's a thought to chew on: America's most intractable problems all double back to our collective mistreatment of animals. Sounds crazy, right? Well, humor me for a minute. Our own lives would improve if we started showing some basic decency to the 9 billion cows, calves, pigs, lambs, turkeys and chickens that are slaughtered a year in the United States. More than 99% of farm animals in the U.S. are raised in factory farms, many unable to even turn around in small cages. A slew of investigations by Mercy for Animals, PETA and the Humane Society of the United States have uncovered repeated instances of vicious abuse of animals headed for slaughter. The latest Humane Society undercover investigation of a large veal calf slaughterhouse in New Jersey showed abuse too gruesome to display on television and resulted in the temporary shutdown of the facility by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. ""Animal abuse is the norm in the meat industry,"" says Paul Shapiro, vice president of farm animal protection at the Humane Society. ""Many standard practices in animal agribusiness are so cruel that they're just out of step with mainstream American values about how animals ought to be treated."" The society cites piglet tail docking and castration without anesthesia, the confinement of pigs to crates where they cannot turn around and cutting off the beaks of egg-laying hens before they're confined to tiny cages. If all of this sounds hideous, it is. And here's how it hurts us humans. The obesity crisis: Two thirds of American adults are overweight or obese. The American Medical Association has declared obesity a chronic disease in an attempt to get a grip on what some label the 21st century plague. A recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that kids who are overweight in kindergarten are often condemned to future obesity. It also showed obesity is highest in the poorest socioeconomic sectors of society, further hobbling already disadvantaged kids. The rise of obesity has paralleled the rise of fast food, laden with meat and dairy products: burgers and shakes. Obesity affects every aspect of a people's lives, from health to relationships. Less fast food would help stop the obesity epidemic and would also mean raising and killing fewer animals. A 2010 study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition concluded, ""a plant-based diet seems to be a sensible approach for the prevention of obesity in children."" The health care crisis: The myriad of serious health risks resulting from poor diet include high cholesterol, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke and even sleep apnea. Eating too much meat and dairy products, combined with excessive intake of sugars and starch, plays a big role in these medical issues. Cholesterol does not exist in vegetables. Vegetables do not clog arteries. A report by the Union of Concerned Scientists says we could save 100,000 lives and $17 billion in health care costs from heart disease every year if Americans ate more fruits and vegetables. The report begs Congress to slash farm policies that subsidize Big Ag's massive production of junk and fast food. Critics say the $956 billion farm bill that just passed is simply a bait and switch that cuts direct subsidies but replaces them with generous crop insurance. That brings us to money. The deficit: Skyrocketing health care costs are a key factor in the ballooning deficit. The yearly medical costs of obesity are estimated to be as high as $190 billion a year, according to a study reported in the Journal of Health Economics, with expenditures of almost $1,200 more a year to treat obese Americans compared with those of normal weight. Natural disasters: Extreme weather phenomena is on the rise leading to more massive, destructive storms as a result of climate change. Hurricane Sandy alone cost $70 billion in damage and lost economic productivity. Meat production is one of the leading causes of climate change because of the destruction of the rainforest for grazing lands, the massive amounts of methane produced by farm animals and the huge amounts of water, grain and other resources required to feed animals The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization found the production of meat contributes from 14% and 22% of the world's greenhouse gases. Hunger: Every five seconds a child dies somewhere in the world of malnutrition or starvation. World hunger could be eliminated if all the produce fed to cows, chickens and pigs raised for human consumption was distributed directly to hungry humans. Bill Gates, who is championing meat alternatives in his ""Future of Food"" project, puts it succinctly when he notes: ""For every 10 kilograms of grain we feed cattle, we get 1 kilogram of beef in return. The calorie kick-back is just too low to feed a growing world population."" Some of the smartest people in America, from Bill Clinton to Bill Gates, are starting to see the big picture. Clinton, after having quadruple bypass surgery and later stents to open his veins, publicly adopted a plant-based diet. Bill Gates, in his Future of Food project, sums up the unsustainability of our food system succinctly, noting: ""raising meat takes a great deal of land and water and has a substantial environmental impact. Put simply, there's no way to produce enough meat for 9 billion people."" The human population of Earth is expected to surpass 9 billion by 2050. Now, it's time for the rest of us to wake up and vote with our shopping carts. American taxpayers and consumers are being exploited right along with the animals.

"(CNN) -- Israeli soldiers apprehended three suspects who tried to cross into Israel while patrolling their country's border with Egypt, authorities said Thursday. A firefight between the soldiers and gunmen on the Egyptian side of the border ensued during the incident, injuring the suspects, according to a statement from the Israeli Defense Forces. A fourth suspect was found dead at the infiltration point, the IDF reported. Israel says the incident occurred after the suspects refused to comply with Israeli orders to stop. Egypt's head of security in northern Sinai said the men were Bedouin tobacco smugglers ""who intended to deliver cigarettes to accomplices on the other side,"" selling the stolen items for twice the normal price. ""They crossed over from South Rafah in northern Sinai,"" said Gen. Saleh Al Masry. ""We have not been informed officially of the incident by the Israeli authorities."" Al Masry also rejected an Israeli statement that described last month's apparent discovery of an explosive device along the border, while also scolding Israel for ""politicizing"" the incident. The suspects were airlifted by helicopter to receive medical care at an Israeli hospital. No Israeli security personnel were injured. ""Smuggling and infiltration into Israel from its western border is used by terror organizations to execute terror attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF soldiers,"" the Israeli military said in the statement. ""The IDF will continue to operate against anyone that poses a threat to the security of the State of Israel and its residents."" Israel has recently ramped up security activity along its western border in the wake of a reported increase in the number of illegal attempts to cross it.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli soldiers and several dozen Palestinians clashed in Jerusalem Saturday, exchanging volleys of rocks, tear gas, fire bombs, and rubber bullets, according to eyewitnesses and the Israeli military. Hundreds of Palestinians gathered in the northern Jerusalem neighborhood of al-Ram for the burial of 25-year-old Palestinian man, Talat Ramiyeh. He was shot the day before by Israeli security forces in a protest opposing Israeli police entering the compound that houses Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque, Palestinian officials said. After the funeral, about 60 Palestinians began throwing rocks and fire bombs at an Israeli military position near the entrance to the neighborhood, an Israeli military spokesman said. The soldiers responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. There was no immediate word of injuries. The death of Ramiyeh prompted a condemnation from Palestinian Authority Prime Minster Salam Fayyad. He implored the the international community to hold Israel responsible for what he described as the ""concerted use of violence against peaceful protests."" The military spokesman said Ramiyeh's death was still under investigation, but a preliminary report suggested that he had been engaged in a ""violent riot"" and aimed fireworks at Israeli security personnel who responded with live fire. The investigation suggested that Ramiyeh was hit in the shoulder, the spokesman said. Saturday's protest marked the latest in a series of disturbances connected to the compound that holds Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque. During the past week, clashes around the sensitive religious site known the Noble Sanctuary to Muslims and the Temple Mount to Jews erupted on multiple occasions amid rumors that Israeli authorities were allowing right-wing Jewish activists access to the compound in order to stoke tensions with Palestinians. Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld denied the reports and said access to the location was being administered under normal guidelines.","The fighting occurred in Jerusalem's al-Ram neighborhood .

Yet it's likely that there will be plenty for doughnuts and Duff beer for Homer, Marge, Bart and company as they prowl the bars, nuclear reactors and other happening locales around Springfield. Twentieth Century Fox Television acknowledged to CNN earlier this week that they were working toward an agreement, while saying future shows couldn't be made ""under its current financial model.""

"(CNN) -- Cruising along the Roanoke Sound, 20 bottlenose dolphins crisscrossed the currents as my family and I toured the Outer Banks of North Carolina in a slow-and-easy, 55-foot pontoon. On a warm summer evening, we joined Captain Johnny's Outer Banks Dolphin Tours in Manteo, North Carolina, which is across the bridge on Roanoke Island. There are three simple words that tourists are encouraged to shout once someone spots dolphins: ""There they are!"" (Even the most cautious adult sightseers can't resist yelling when they see a dolphin skimming the surf.) Life's a beach at Cape Hatteras . Captain Johnny's guarantees dolphin sightings on each cruise, and the popular boat tour enterprise doesn't disappoint. Halfway through our two-hour cruise, I stopped counting after spotting about 30 playful dolphins surrounding our boat. ""This is a very active group of dolphins today,"" our guide told us. ""We don't know how many dolphins we'll see each day -- but we do know we'll find them."" The dolphin watch cruise -- a must-do activity for families -- leaves from a bayside dock in Manteo, a quaint waterfront town on the eastern side of Roanoke Island where in the late 1800s every store lining the waterfront had a door to come ashore by boat. Roanoke Island is part of a string of barrier islands that stretches 200 miles along the North Carolina coast. Driving to the Outer Banks is a great road trip for families; it's a destination that has something for everyone: inexpensive seaside restaurants serving fresh seafood and burgers, boutique shops and outlet stores, mini-golf, boardwalks, fishing, boat tours, ice cream and fudge shops, jet-ski rentals, hang gliding and a range of hotels, bed and breakfasts and oceanfront rental homes and condos. There are three popular islands in the Outer Banks -- Bodie, Roanoke and Hatteras, each with its distinct charm and history but all with some common features: sandy beaches and spectacular ocean views. Bodie Island includes the communities of Duck, Nags Head, Kitty Hawk and Kill Devil Hills. Visit the Wright Brothers National Memorial in Kill Devil Hills, where the first flight took off on December 17, 1903. Stop in Nags Head, home to the largest sand dune on the East Coast, Jockey's Ridge, and check out dozens of gorgeous high-end homes. Also visit Jennette's Pier for lunch or dinner, fishing and great ocean scenery. The 1,000-foot pier is the oldest pier in the Outer Banks and a great hangout for children. Check out Duck, which boasts seven miles of pristine beaches, bike paths and jet skiing. Be sure to walk through town and pick up a pint of homemade ice cream. On Hatteras Island, visit the Hatteras Island Visitor Center and Museum of the Sea at the historic Cape Hatteras Lighthouse Double Keepers' Quarters. Also tour the lighthouse. The first Cape Hatteras Lighthouse was lit in 1803, according to the National Park Service. At nearly 200 feet tall, the current structure is the tallest brick lighthouse in the United States. Take time to climb the lighthouse. It's a fun experience for the entire family. For maritime buffs, also stop by the Graveyard of the Atlantic Museum in Hatteras Village. Exhibits include evidence of numerous shipwrecks around the Outer Banks, the result of treacherous seas. If you're a pirate enthusiast, then Ocracoke Island, south of Hatteras, is the place for you. In the late 1600s and early 1700s, the Outer Banks was a secret base for pirates. They hijacked Spanish and British ships carrying gold and silver and stashed the booty in the crevices of the Outer Banks. The most famous pirate of the Outer Banks was Edward Teach, also known as ""Blackbeard,"" who frequented Ocracoke. Blackbeard's ship, Queen Anne's Revenge, wrecked off the coast of the Outer Banks in 1718. For an evening of entertainment and history, plan to see the theatrical stage production ""The Lost Colony,"" the dramatic story of 113 colonists who mysteriously disappeared on Roanoke Island in 1590. The musical is performed in an amphitheater in Manteo, on Roanoke Island, on a stage that is three times the size of most Broadway productions. English families first settled in the Outer Banks in 1587, and many descendants of the early British pioneers still live on Roanoke Island today. Don't miss the North Carolina Aquarium on Roanoke Island, which features the largest collection of sharks in the state as well as an outstanding interactive exhibit for kids called Operation: Sea Turtle Rescue. The 68,000-square-foot aquarium features the Outer Banks' vast aquatic life, including horseshoe crabs, rays and alligators. One of the most popular exhibits in the aquarium is the ""touch room,"" where children can touch rays, horseshoe crabs, hermit crabs and other creatures in a safe and controlled environment. A real treat for aquarium visitors is the high-velocity Hurricane Simulator that generates wind speeds of 78 mph -- the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane. Adults and children stand in line for this exhibit. Don't miss it. It will blow you away. Where to stay . We stayed overnight in Manteo -- our base in the Outer Banks -- and drove to other places such as Nags Head, Duck, Kitty Hawk, Southern Shores, Kill Devil Hills and Pea Island, the site of the first all-black U.S. Coast Guard life-saving station in the late 1800s. For couples, the Roanoke Bungalow is a charming bed and breakfast on a quiet street in Manteo. This family-owned home, originally built in the 1930s, has been renovated and transformed into a delightful and relaxing B&B. And Cheryl Wiggins prepares an outstanding continental breakfast each morning. Also try the Tranquil House Inn in the heart of town. Our second-floor room overlooked the bay and marina. The wine and cheese reception every evening is a nice touch, and a tasty breakfast is included each morning. Rooms are spacious, and the hotel is within walking distance of most local activities. Where to eat . For a great meal and a wonderful atmosphere, try 1587, the Tranquil House Inn's restaurant. It's a bit pricey but well worth it. If the mahi-mahi is on the menu, order it. Ask for a table overlooking the marina. For excellent traditional Latin food try La Cabana. It's inexpensive, great food and large potions. Try the empanadas, chicken stew and seafood dishes.

"(CNN) -- Earth is in the grip of the ""sixth great extinction crisis,"" say some scientists, with up to 2,000 species dying out each year. These 11 great wildlife experiences could disappear within your lifetime. 1. Witnessing a great animal migration . Ancient rock art images of animals moving across the African savannah indicate that humans have been marveling at animal migrations for more than 20,000 years. But poaching, agriculture, war and deforestation are encroaching on wildlife corridors around the world, placing these animal movements -- from Africa's wildebeest migration to the annual pilgrimage of North American bison -- under threat. How to do it: GAdventures pairs good wildlife access with creature comforts on its Kenya Safari Experience tour (eight days from $3,490 per person; +1 888 800 4100), taking in Kenya's Lake Nakuru, Amboseli National Park and the Masai Mara, where Africa's wildebeest end their migration. 2. Coming eye-to-eye with a polar bear . While hunting is still allowed by some Arctic-dwelling native communities, it's climate change that poses the largest threat to polar bears. Latest data from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) shows that eight of the 19 sub-populations of polar bear that roam the Arctic are in decline. Scientists project that two-thirds of all polar bears could disappear by 2050. Due to its southern exposure, Canada's Hudson Bay is one of the bear habitats most threatened by climate change -- increasing temperatures are forcing bears off the ice earlier each year. How to do it: Churchill Wild (+1 866 846 9453) is one of a handful of operators on the western shores of Hudson Bay that facilitate multi-day bear watching tours starting at around $3,000 per person. 3. Counting the stripes on a tiger . Tigers once roamed freely across Asia. Today the world's most endangered big cats have disappeared from 90% of their historic range. Just six of nine known tiger species are thought to remain, with an estimated 3,200 animals left in the wild. While it's extremely rare to spot the elusive beasts in their natural habitat (the South China tiger, for example, hasn't been seen since the early 1970s), protected reserves in India and Nepal provide the best opportunities. How to do it: Intrepid Travel offers a Chitwan Extension (four days from $430 per person; +1 800 970 7299) tour to Nepal's Chitwan National Park from Kathmandu. Once a royal hunting reserve, Chitwan is home to elephant, rhino, crocodile, monkeys, deer and about 100 Bengal tigers. 4. Swimming amid live coral on Australia's Great Barrier Reef . The Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest reef system, is in peril. Temperature fluctuations are primarily to blame for the disappearance of half its coral since 1985 and the Australian Institute of Marine Science predicts that less than a quarter could be left within a decade. Following plans by the Australian government to industrialize parts of the reef, the World Heritage Committee passed a recommendation to consider listing the UNESCO site as ""in danger"" at a meeting in June 2014. How to do it: Calypso Snorkel and Dive (+61 7 4099 6999) offers daily snorkeling and diving day trips to the reef from the Far North Queensland resort town of Port Douglas starting from $174 per person. 5. Tracking gorillas in the mist . Endemic to the forests of central Africa, both species of the world's largest primate have been decreasing in numbers for decades largely due to poaching and disease. Worryingly, a 2010 United Nations report suggested that these gentle giants of the forest might disappear from large parts of the Congo Basin, one of their primary habitats, by the mid-2020s. How to do it: Wilderness Collection offers gorilla tracking opportunities during a six-day tour, from $6,474 per person, split between two luxury Odzala camps (+27 11 807 1800) in an area of the Republic of the Congo that's home to a high density of western lowland gorilla. Chimpanzee, leopard, golden cat and a large number of other primate and bird species are also present. 6. Seeing the creatures of Galápagos as Darwin saw them . Remaining virtually undiscovered for centuries did much to preserve the living showcase of evolution described by Charles Darwin in ""The Origin of Species."" But Ecuador's best known ecosystem remains fragile. The last remaining Pinta Island tortoise, fondly known as Lonesome George, died in 2012, adding to the list of several other species that have died out since Darwin's 1835 visit. How to do it: While it's possible to fly to Galapagos from mainland Ecuador and visit several islands independently, you can only reach the bulk of protected habitats on heavily regulated organized cruises. You can expect to pay from around $1,500 for a last-minute, week-long cruise organized in the capital Quito or Puerto Ayora on the island of Santa Cruz. Prices double (or more) for the convenience of booking ahead through an international company such as Ecoventura (+1 800 633 7972). 7. Hanging around with orangutans . Sharing 98% of our DNA, orangutans are one of the closest relatives to man, though if predictions are accurate, Asia's only two great ape species could be extinct in the wild within the next decade. Conservation groups such as Borneo Orangutan Survival have bolstered numbers through rehabilitation and release programs, but the illegal pet trade, trafficking and habitat destruction still present the greatest threats to the survival of orangutans on the only two islands they inhabit: Borneo and Sumatra. How to do it: Gecko's Adventures include a visit to two rehabilitation centers in Malaysian Borneo on their Orangutanland tour (18 days from $2,500; +44 0808 274 5981). The trip includes a cruise down Kinabatangan River, where you might spot orangutans, proboscis monkeys, macaques and elephants in the wild. 8. Watching sea turtles nest . Scientists have been debating for decades why -- not to mention how -- sea turtles return to the same beach every year to lay their eggs. But the phenomenon may soon be a thing of legend thanks to the ravages of intense egg collection, fisheries bycatch and light pollution, which have forced species such as the leatherback, hawksbill and green turtles onto endangered lists. How to do it: You can sign up for a volunteering stint with an organization such as Earthwatch (nine-day Costa Rica program from $2,800 per person; +1 978 461 0081) during which you'll help safeguard turtle eggs and assist new hatchlings. 9. Spotting Africa's Big Five . European game hunters and the illegal wildlife trade may soon reduce Africa's most prestigious group of game animals from the legendary Big Five to four. While lion, African elephant, Cape buffalo and leopard populations are relatively stable, rhinos are in serious trouble. Poaching has increased dramatically during the past few years, with 800 rhinos killed illegally in South Africa in 2013 alone. Last year, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) declared the western black rhino officially extinct. How to do it: All members of the Big Five can still be found in Botswana, Uganda, Namibia, Ethiopia, South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Malawi and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. If you're particularly eager to see rhinos, Intrepid Travel's Okavango Experience (nine days from $1,155 per person; +1 800 970 7299) includes a dusk game drive in Botswana's Khama Rhino Sanctuary for a chance to spot both white and black rhino. 10. Swimming alongside whale sharks . Nicknamed ""dominos"" for their distinctive markings, the world's largest fish are among the most placid of the shark species. Unfortunately, demand for whale shark meat, fins and oil, on top of unregulated tourism, remains an enormous threat to this vulnerable species. How to do it: A WWF-sponsored ecotourism project in the Philippine village of Donsol allows tourists to swim with whale sharks while following strict rules to avoid disturbing them. Donsol EcoTour (+63 2 576 5934) offers snorkeling packages with gear and a trained guide from around $25 per person. 11. Be awed by a giant panda in the wild . They're China's natural treasure, but threats from humans have left just 1,600 giant pandas in the wild. High in the mountains of western China, the rarest member of the bear family plays a critical role in facilitating the growth and vegetation of the bamboo forests these placid beasts inhabit. How to do it: Given the difficulty of spotting giant pandas in the wild, only a small number of tour operators exist. The WWF-partnered Natural Habitat Adventures' Wild Side of China tour (13 days from $9,595 per person; +1 303 449 3711) includes a visit to China's Chengdu Giant Panda Base and rare access to a panda sanctuary to search for them in the wild.

"Washington (CNN) -- A 9-year-old boy's request to have ""Israel"" listed as the place of birth on his U.S. passport was met with wariness by the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday. Menachem Zivotofsky was born in Jerusalem, a disputed region in the eyes of the Obama administration, which argued in court the larger issue should be resolved by bilateral negotiations, not by a 2002 federal law favoring the family and 50,000 other Americans born in the holy city. The case is a classic fight between congressional and executive authority, with foreign policy the source of the current controversy. While the justices appeared ready to rule against the Zivotofskys, they also indicated concern about the president having either near-absolute control or a weaker influence over diplomatic and international relations, with many on the bench suggesting a middle-ground approach sure to displease both sides. Justice Anthony Kennedy expressed concern that the congressionally-approved law giving Americans the discretion to change ""Jerusalem"" on current passports to ""Israel"" offers a ""cramped"" view of the president's power to conduct foreign policy amid undue congressional interference. But Justice Sonia Sotomayor worried whether the president ""was entitled to ignore Congress"" in the international arena, suggesting it was an ""unsettling"" idea. At issue are two questions, one narrow, one broad: Can courts intervene to enforce a federal law explicitly directing the State Department how to record the birthplace of an American citizen on a passport? And does the law impermissibly infringe on the president's power to recognize a foreign sovereign? ""There have been 50,000 Americans in the last 10 years that were born in Jerusalem, and many of them would like to have Israel indicated as their place of birth in the passports,"" said Sarah Cleveland, a Columbia University Law School professor, and until recently a counselor on international law at the State Department. ""But this is also an extremely important geopolitical issue and a very sensitive foreign relations issue for the United States."" The high court case is Zivotofsky v. Clinton, but the key player in this dispute is perhaps the most famous city in the world, and one of the oldest human settlements still in existence: Jerusalem. Its name translates as ""City of Peace"" to some, ""Holy Sanctuary"" to others. It is Israel's largest city and its capital, though that is not recognized by the United Nations and most of the world community. The city is home to Ari and Naomi Zivotofsky. The couple and their two oldest children were born in the United States, but the family migrated to West Jerusalem a decade ago, and in 2002 the youngest, Menachem Binyamin was born. ""We're very proud of the fact that he was born in Israel and that we live in Israel and it's the modern state of Israel,"" Ari Zivotofsky told CNN Correspondent Kate Bolduan. ""Religiously and historically, that's very significant."" The family attended the court session and were cautiously optimistic they would prevail. Just three weeks before Menachem was born, the United States Congress gave U.S. citizens born in Jerusalem the individual discretion to ask that Israel be listed on passports and consular reports, where it says ""Place of Birth."" President George W. Bush signed the bill, but issued an executive ""signing statement"" indicating he would not comply. That law, and the Zivotofsky's long-standing request were at the center of the 70-minute argument. Justice Antonin Scalia wondered whether the court should be involved in a dispute between the other two branches of federal government. ""It seems to me you are not arguing for a co-equal congressional power, you are arguing for a superior congressional power,"" he told the Zivotofsky's lawyer Nathan Lewin. ""You are saying whatever Congress says, the president has to comply with. Now, that's quite different from saying that they both have authority in the field. And if they both have authority in the field and they are exercising it in different fashions, I frankly would not be inclined to intervene."" Sotomayor took another approach. ""What happens if there is a peace accord tomorrow, and Israel gives up any claim to sovereignty over Jerusalem? Is the president free to stop listing Israel on the passport? Or does he have to wait for Congress to change the law?"" ""I think he does have to wait for Congress to change the law,"" replied Lewin. ""So you are hobbling the president with respect to situations that occur frequently, as happened in Egypt, sometimes overnight."" A popular uprising there and nearby Libya resulted in two longstanding regimes being overthrown, which the Obama administration both supported and tentatively recognized as the new ruling authorities. Donald Verrilli, the Justice Department's new solicitor general, offered a sweeping view of presidential power in his argument to the court. ""Under the Constitution that is an exercise of the Executive's exclusive recognition power,"" he said. ""The Constitution commits that power exclusively to the executive and neither a court nor the Congress can override that judgment."" Several on the bench offered their doubts. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg somewhat skeptically wondered whether the court should be held back from answering the broader question of presidential authority. ""Why not all the way? I mean, if the (Supreme) Court decides that the Constitution commits this authority exclusively to the president, then it's all over,"" she said. ""That's the merits of the case: Does the president have this authority?"" Justice Samuel Alito added it would depend on the kind of authority asserted. ""If the question is whether the president has exclusive authority with respect to the formal recognition of a foreign country, that might be one thing,"" he said. ""But what if the question is whether the president has exclusive jurisdiction -- plenary authority, unreviewable authority -- with respect to anything that the president thinks has a bearing on the question of recognition?"" The tone of his question suggested he thought the government was reaching too far. Verrilli said the government was not taking that power that far, but said courts should give ""a very significant measure of deference"" to the White House and State Department. Scalia hypothesized whether Congress could try and block the president from recognizing a breakaway province of a foreign sovereign, which could prompt a U.S. war with that country. Even if the president were ""foolish"" to do so -- in Scalia's words -- Verrilli said that was still the president's prerogative. ""Our cases say repeatedly that the president is the sole instrument of the United States for the conduct of foreign policy, but to be the sole instrument and to determine the foreign policy are two quite different things,"" said Scalia. ""But it doesn't necessarily mean that the president determines everything in foreign policy... there is certainly room ... for saying that Congress can say what the country's instrument is supposed to do."" This case is the first substantive look at a president's ""inherent"" authority since a series of cases over the Bush administration's war on terror since the 9/11 attacks, and the power to detain suspected ""enemy combatants."" Several high court rulings restricted the military's authority to detain suspected terrorists without access to federal courts to contest their overseas imprisonment. A ruling in the Zivotofsky appeal is expected sometime before June. The case is Zivotofsky v. Clinton (10-699).","The Supreme Court is wary on a passport question .

"(CNN) -- It may take days or even weeks to find a venomous Egyptian cobra that has gone missing from New York's Bronx Zoo, officials say. But staffers hold out hope that the 20-inch, pencil-thin snake is hiding out somewhere in the zoo's reptile house and will surface when her ""comfort level rises."" ""Our best strategy is patience, allowing her time to come out of hiding,"" said zoo director Jim Breheny. ""We understand the interest in this story and that everyone wants us to find the missing snake. Right now, it's the snake's game,"" Breheny said in a statement posted on the zoo's website Monday. The zoo learned the adolescent Egyptian cobra was missing from an off-exhibit enclosure Saturday. Staff members closed and secured the reptile house. Daily sweeps continue. The zoo director said he is confident the snake will begin to move around the building to seek food and water once she feels completely secure. The Bronx Zoo case is reminiscent of an incident at Zoo Atlanta last year when a tiger rattlesnake went missing. Zoo officials believed the snake was hiding somewhere in the reptile house. But it was found two days later in the front porch of a neighborhood house where the homeowner had clubbed it to death -- unaware that it had escaped from the zoo. The Egyptian cobra is most commonly found in North Africa. Its venom is so deadly that it can kill a full-grown elephant in three hours -- or a person in about 15 minutes, according to wildlife experts. The venom destroys nerve tissue and causes paralysis and death due to respiratory failure. Scholars believe the Egyptian cobra was known in ancient times as the asp. Legend has it that Cleopatra, the ancient Egyptian queen, used an asp to commit suicide. While zoo personnel continue their search, someone has set up a cheeky Twitter account to chronicle the snake's fictitious adventures as she apparently explores New York City. In 11 hours since it was created Monday, the @BronxZoosCobra had collected more than 20,000 followers with tweets such as, ""Leaving Wall Street. These guys make my skin crawl.""","Officials hope the snake will surface when her comfort level rises .

"(CNN) -- More than 3,500 people have been infected by the Ebola virus in Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria since the first documented cases in December, according to new figures released Wednesday by the World Health Organization. More than 1,900 people have died. There is also a smaller, unrelated outbreak in Congo and at least one confirmed case in Senegal, according to WHO Director General Dr. Margaret Chan. She characterized the outbreak as a ""global threat"" and encouraged the international community to do more to combat it. Chan complimented the United States for its ""very strong support"" through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said the official numbers are lower than the actual number of cases, because families afraid of the stigma associated with Ebola do not report sick loved ones. Others are caring for patients in isolation. Frieden characterized the outbreak as ""spiraling out of control"" Tuesday in a conversation on CNN's ""New Day."" ""What we're seeing is a ... hugely fast increase in cases that's harder and harder to manage,"" he said. ""The more we can get in there and tamp that down, the fewer cases we'll have in the weeks and months to come."" Dr. David Nabarro, the senior United Nations system coordinator for Ebola, said that in observing the disease on the ground, he noticed that a number of the infections have spread between family members who are caring for the sick. They must care for those infected with Ebola because there are not enough hospital beds, nor are there enough ambulances to transport people safely. If the patients do get to a health care facility, there is not a good system of infection control, nor is there enough protective equipment to go around. Nabarro said there is a desperate need for personnel to help on the ground as well as for nurses, doctors and ambulance drivers in West Africa. The area also needs money to fight the outbreak -- at least $600 million, by some estimates. The fact that airlines have stopped flying to the countries affected has kept people isolated and has inadvertently made the outbreak worse, making it harder for staff and supplies to make it there. New cases in Nigeria . Nigeria's minister of health said there are three new confirmed cases of Ebola in Port Harcourt, the country's oil hub. The ministry believes other cases will be confirmed there shortly. Ebola initially arrived in Nigeria through an infected air traveler. The passenger landed in Lagos on July 20 and died five days later. One person who was put into quarantine after he came into contact with the passenger fled the city and sought treatment in Port Harcourt. A doctor who treated him developed symptoms and died a little more than a week later. Not knowing he was sick, the doctor treated other patients. He also came into contact with members of the community after family and friends visited to celebrate the birth of a baby and after members of his church visited him at the hospital. Nigerian health leaders are monitoring the health of more than 200 people who may have had contact with the doctor. About 60 more are considered to have had high-risk or very high-risk exposure. The other confirmed Nigerian cases now include the doctor's spouse, who is also a doctor, and a patient at the hospital where the doctor was treated. Staff members are being tested for Ebola. With the help of the CDC and the WHO, an isolation facility has been set up to handle additional Ebola cases. Civic unrest and security issues, coupled with the public's fear of Ebola, are among the concerns. The military has been called in to escort people to the clinic. More need for help . Dr. Joanne Liu, the international president of Doctors Without Borders, spoke at a special United Nations briefing on Wednesday, criticizing the international community's ""lethally inadequate"" response to the global threat. The group, also known as Medecins Sans Frontieres, has been on the ground fighting the outbreak since March. Liu made what her organization described as an ""unprecedented call"" for U.N. members with the technology to intervene in a biological threat to do so immediately. ""Six months into the worst Ebola epidemic in history, the world is losing the battle to contain it,"" she said. ""Leaders are failing to come to grips with this transnational threat. The WHO announcement on August 8 that the epidemic constituted a 'public health emergency of international concern' has not led to decisive action, and states have essentially joined a global coalition of inaction,"" she said. ""The clock is ticking, and Ebola is winning,"" Liu warned. ""The time for meetings and planning is over. It is now time to act. Every day of inaction means more deaths and the slow collapse of societies."" British patient gets better . Medical personnel have been particularly vulnerable in this Ebola outbreak. William Pooley, a British volunteer nurse who cared for Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, was the first Briton known to be infected. Doctors flew him back to be treated in an isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in North London. He stayed there for 10 days of treatment that included the experimental drug ZMapp, which was also used to treat two American medical personnel last month who have since been released from the hospital. Pooley's doctors released him from care on Tuesday.","More than 3,500 people are infected, and more than 1,900 have died, WHO says .

"(CNN) -- Copenhagen Zoo, which gained notoriety last month for killing a young giraffe named Marius and feeding his corpse to the lions, has hit the headlines again, as a healthy family of lions has now joined its growing death tally. Two adult lions and two cubs have been killed so that a new male can be introduced into the captive group to ""make room for a new generation."" In remarks reminiscent of those made to justify the death of Marius, the zoo's director Steffen StrÃ¦de claimed the lions had to be put down ""partly to avoid inbreeding between the two young lions and their father."" In any case, it was stated, the young cubs would likely have been killed by the new male. Unsurprisingly, the response to the newest development has been one of incredulity, with members of the public calling for a boycott and the sacking of those staff responsible. But this is not the answer. There is no quick fix which will see an end to the killing of healthy animals by the zoo industry. Zoos manage animals in confined spaces. Animals will breed and produce offspring. With the exception of those used in aquariums, few animals are now taken from their natural habitat to populate zoos and so the genetic diversity of the captive population is finite, as is the space available to house them. Individuals can be moved from one zoo or another on a case-by-case basis, but this will not make the problem go away. It is clear that while there are zoos, the killing will continue. There may be no quick fix, but there is a solution, and that is to withdraw support for the zoo industry and accept that the exhibition of animals as entertainment is no longer acceptable. This view may be seen by some as radical but we really have very little to lose by ridding ourselves of our affection for zoos. The animals, on the other hand, have so much to gain. Many people now believe that holding animals captive is distasteful and the zoo industry has sought to reinvent itself in recent years to suggest that its work is founded in conservation and education, but animals born in zoos are rarely released to the wild and the vast majority will spend their entire lives in captivity. Conservation efforts are most effective when carried out in situ, as it is only in the animals' natural habitat that the complexities of habitat destruction or poaching, for example, can be addressed in any meaningful way. A report commissioned and published by the zoo industry in 2011 demonstrated that it lags behind charitable organizations The Nature Conservancy and the WWF Global Network in its financial support for conservation efforts. Indeed, the report demonstrated that the financial contribution of the ""global zoo community"" collectively is less than the contribution made by two individual not-for-profit organisations independently of one another. The traditional argument put forward by zoos that people need to see animals in order to support conservation is, therefore, not borne out by the evidence. Education may be a laudable aim for zoos to pursue, but the suggestion that animals should be incarcerated for their entire lives in order that we fulfil our desire to learn about them is morally questionable, at best. This is particularly true when we consider that there are so many other sources we can use to teach ourselves about animals and conservation. Indeed, a study commissioned by the UK government, published in 2010, made clear that, while zoo education programmes exist, their efficacy has never been proved. It may seem difficult to imagine a world without zoos, but it is not such an extreme concept. If we are serious about conservation, our efforts should be focused on natural habitats. If we care about animals, we should not support an industry which treats them with such callous disregard. If we want the killing to stop, we must stop going to the zoo.

"Rome (CNN) -- The Vatican sought Saturday to tamp down rumors involving sex, money and gay priests that have been swirling in the Italian media and have been linked by some to Pope Benedict XVI's decision to resign. The strongly-worded denial came on the eve of the pope's last Angelus blessing, expected to draw huge crowds of the faithful, before he stands down on Thursday. Vatican Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone said it was ""deplorable"" that as the time for the Roman Catholic cardinals to elect a new pope approaches, a rash of ""often unverified, unverifiable or completely false news stories"" has appeared. Such unfounded stories ""cause serious damage to persons and institutions,"" he said, and are an attempt to influence the cardinals' free will in the election ""through public opinion."" Opinion: There's more to the Catholic Church than the pope . Bertone did not address the specific claims that were first published in La Repubblica, the country's largest circulation daily newspaper, on Thursday and Friday. The newspaper stories center on an investigation last year by three cardinals into a scandal involving leaks from the Vatican. La Repubblica, citing unnamed sources familiar with the investigation, alleged that the investigation revealed a series of scandals involving sex, money and power that touch cardinals, priests and lay people that work in the Vatican. Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi declined to comment on La Repubblica's article in a media briefing on Thursday. CNN Senior Vatican Analyst John Allen, also a correspondent with the National Catholic Reporter, suggested in a piece written Friday that unsourced speculation about a shadowy ""gay lobby"" within the Vatican should be taken with a grain of salt. But, he said, while he doesn't know for sure if the three cardinals did investigate networks based on sexual orientation, ""frankly, it would be a little surprising if they hadn't"" -- given past scandals that have become public concerning clergy involved in homosexual activities. The pope may well have been worn down by the ""cumulative impact of the various meltdowns over the last eight years,"" Allen said. ""However,"" he added, ""it's probably a stretch to draw a straight line between all of this and Benedict's resignation. For the most part, one has to take the pope at his word: He's stepping aside because he's old and tired, not because of any particular crisis."" The pontiff will leave office at 8 p.m. on February 28, two-and-a-half weeks after he shocked the Roman Catholic world by announcing his resignation. The Vatican has said a new pope will be in place for the Church's Easter celebrations on March 31. Benedict on Saturday concluded a week-long spiritual retreat, held to mark the Lenten period. Addressing the clergy who had joined him, he thanked them ""not only for this week, but for these past eight years that you have carried with me -- with great skill, affection, love and faith -- the weight of the Petrine ministry,"" referring to the papacy. Benedict also met with Italian President Giorgio Napolitano on Saturday, an encounter described by the Vatican as ""particularly warm and cordial."" Facts about Pope Benedict XVI . The pontiff is considering changing the Vatican constitution to allow a vote for his successor to begin before March 15, Lombardi said Wednesday. Existing rules say the Roman Catholic Church's cardinals should start voting on a replacement from 15 to 20 days after the papal throne becomes vacant. With Benedict due to depart on February 28, the cardinals' conclave ordinarily would start no sooner than March 15. But Lombardi has said that because Benedict was leaving the papacy through resignation rather than death, the Vatican would explore the possibility of selecting a new pope sooner than normally prescribed. The so-called ""Vatileaks"" scandal last year led to the pope's butler, Paolo Gabriele, being convicted on charges of leaking private papers from the Vatican in a high-profile trial and sentenced to 18 months in prison. Although Gabriele was pardoned weeks later by the pope, the whole affair -- which revealed claims of corruption in the church's hierarchy -- was damaging to the Vatican's reputation. The latest media allegations, despite the strenuous Vatican denials, may add to the pressure for reform. CNN's Hada Messia and Ben Wedeman reported from Rome, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London.","Top Vatican official condemns ""often unverified, unverifiable or completely false news stories""

"London (CNN) -- With all the fuss in the media at the moment about Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee anyone could be forgiven for thinking that the British are united in their adoration of their monarch. The reality is that while a large swathe of public opinion is largely indifferent to the royals -- but happy to have an extra public holiday to mark the jubilee -- many millions want the whole institution of monarchy consigned to the history books. The British republican movement has been growing rapidly over the past 18 months -- thanks in large part to the heightened royal coverage prompted by last year's wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton and this year's jubilee. Our cause is simple: it's about democratic reform and a rejection of inherited power and privilege. The case for Britain becoming a republic is threefold: the monarchy is wrong in principle, in practice and it is wrong politically. We're supposed to be a democratic society, which means we should cherish and value democratic values, such as equality of citizenship, freedom to participate in government, accountability and transparency. In a democratic society there is no room for a head of state who is put there for life and by birth. A hereditary monarch has no place in a society that believes ""we the people"" should be in charge. The principled objection is unanswerable. In practice the monarchy is an institution that is not fit for purpose. It is secretive, having recently lobbied successfully to have itself removed entirely from the reaches of our Freedom of Information laws; it lobbies government ministers for improvements to its financial benefits and for its own private agenda; it is hugely costly -- an estimated Â£202 million a year, enough to pay for thousands of teachers, nurses or police officers at a time of sweeping public spending cuts. The queen and Prince Charles must be asked for consent before our elected parliament is able to debate any legislation that affects their private interests -- that consent is sought in secret and we have no idea whether, how or how many times it has been used. Politically the monarchy is wrong because -- contrary to what is believed by many here and abroad -- it is a central feature of our unwritten constitution. The ""Crown"" is the supreme authority in this country -- not the people. The Crown has vast powers that cannot be challenged in a court of law and those powers are exercised by the queen on the instruction of our prime minister. Those powers include considerable patronage -- the ability to appoint bishops, government ministers, heads of public bodies and so on -- as well as the power to go to war, sign treaties and change the law through the little-understood Privy Council. Thanks to the Crown there is almost no limit to the power of our politicians other than those limits they place upon themselves (such as our Human Rights Act, which they have the power to repeal). The pomp of the monarchy is a neat way of distracting from this highly questionable constitutional arrangement. It is the power of the Crown and the authority it gives our politicians that most likely explains the hostility every government has shown the republican movement. But rather than engage with the issue on these serious matters most monarchists instead implore us to believe in fantasy and make-believe. ""The queen has never put a foot wrong"" is the time-honored clichÃ©, along with ""but what about all the tourism the monarchy generates?"" The tourism argument goes that as Britain has a monarchy and also attracts a lot of tourists, the monarchy obviously acts as a great tourism magnet and therefore generates millions of pounds of revenue and economic activity. The problem is that there are no facts to back this up. Does the monarchy pay its way? There is no reason to believe that if Britain abandoned the monarchy tourism would suffer -- that's something even the head of official tourism agency VisitBritain has acknowledged. Our history is certainly an attraction -- and the great thing about our history is that it will always be there regardless of what we do in the future. Selling hotel rooms and ""I Love London"" T-shirts is, anyway, no reason to abandon a proud ambition for democratic reform. As for the queen, well we really have no idea how she has done her job given that most of it is done behind closed doors. There has never been any real scrutiny of her role and she has never had to compete in open and free competition for the job. If keeping quiet and cutting ribbons is all we can expect of our head of state then perhaps we can agree she's done well -- but surely we can expect more. As a national figurehead and leading public figure the queen has utterly failed to do anything of note or worth. After 60 years who can quote a famous speech or point to a moment of crisis or celebration when the queen offered leadership and inspiration? For all the failures of the monarchy -- in principle, practice and in political terms -- the queen and the institution offer little in return but an empty chair where an inspiring national figure could have stood. These are the reasons why come the jubilee, republicans will be rejecting the celebrations and demanding real democratic change. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Graham Smith.","Millions want monarchy consigned to history, argues Graham Smith of Republic group .

""For now, and forever, I will live, breathe, sleep, and not sleep with the memory of Mr. Grant screaming 'you shot me' and me putting my hands on the bullet wound thinking the pressure would help while I kept telling him 'you'll be okay,'"" Mehserle says in the letter. ""I tried to tell myself that maybe this shot would not be so serious, but I recall how sick I felt when Mr. Grant stopped talking, closed his eyes and seemed to change his breathing."" Mehserle's letter was dated July 4, four days before a jury found him guilty of involuntary manslaughter for shooting 22-year-old Grant on an Oakland train platform on January 1, 2009. Mehserle, who was on duty as a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer at the time of the incident, said at the trial that he intended to draw and fire his Taser rather than his gun, CNN affiliate KTVU reported. ""I have and will continue to live everyday of my life knowing that Mr. Grant should not have been shot,"" his letter said. ""No words can express how truly sorry I am."" The involuntary manslaughter conviction usually carries a maximum four-year sentence, but some in Oakland expected a tougher penalty for the former police officer, and took to the streets in protest Thursday. Crowds broke the glass of a Foot Locker and other stores. Others threw sneakers out of the store as police wearing gas masks stormed the area. Outside the courtroom, Grant family members expressed outrage at the verdict. ""My son was murdered. He was murdered. He was murdered. My son was murdered,"" said Grant's mother, Wanda Johnson. ""The system has let us down, but God will never ever let us down."" Johnson and other speakers said African-Americans have been the victims of police abuse and a biased judicial system. She said Mehserle wasn't found accountable. ""We couldn't get even six hours of deliberations,"" said Johnson, who accused jurors of being unfair. Oakland police said there were 78 arrests during Thursday night's protests on charges including failure to disperse, resisting arrest, burglary, vandalism and assaulting a police officer. Mehserle's trial was moved from Alameda County to Los Angeles because of pre-trial publicity. Members of the jury, which included no African-Americans, said they were unanimous in their decision. Their finding indicates that Mehserle was criminally negligent. The shooting was captured on a bystander's cell-phone video camera. The video, which showed Mehserle pulling his gun and fatally shooting Grant in the back as another officer knelt on the unarmed man, was widely circulated on the Internet and on news broadcasts, and it spurred several protests in and around Oakland. Mehserle resigned his position a few days after the incident and was later arrested in Nevada. His sentencing is set for August 6. Involuntary manslaughter carries a maximum sentence of up to four years in prison under California law. But the judge could add an ""enhancement"" that could provide a longer sentence because a firearm was used.","Johannes Mehserle says he is ""truly sorry"" for shooting Oscar Grant .

"(CNN) -- Millions of migrant workers flood to the Middle East from some of the world's poorest countries in search of paid work they won't find at home. But for some, the journey doesn't end as they hope. Instead, they become victims of human trafficking, forced labor and sexual exploitation. The CNN Freedom Project: Join CNN's fight to end modern day slavery . A report released Tuesday by the International Labor Organization paints a horrifying picture of migrant workers who find themselves trapped in appalling conditions without any way to get out. ""Our research team interviewed hundreds of workers and their experiences independent of country were very similar, actually,"" Beate Andrees, the report's author and head of the ILO's Special Action Programme to Combat Forced Labour, told CNN. ""They were lured into jobs that either didn't exist or that were offered under conditions that were very different from what they were promised in the first place,"" she said. Data is scarce, but the ILO estimates as many as 600,000 people may be victims of forced labor across the Middle East. That equates to 3.4 in every 1,000 of the region's inhabitants being compelled to work against their free choice, the ILO said. The study, titled ""Tricked and Trapped: Human Trafficking in the Middle East,"" is based on more than 650 interviews done over a two-year period in Jordan, Lebanon, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. More than half of those interviewed for the study were migrant workers, the ILO said. The others included employers, government officials and representatives of employers' and workers' groups in the Middle East. ""Labour migration in this part of the world is unique in terms of its sheer scale and its exponential growth in recent years,"" Andrees said. ""The challenge is how to put in place safeguards in both origin and destination countries to prevent the exploitation and abuse of these workers."" Low-skilled migrant workers are the most vulnerable to human trafficking and forced labor, whether at the hands of unscrupulous agents or individual employers, the report states. ""Victims of trafficking usually have limited financial resources, incur debt and are poorly educated,"" it says. ""At the same time, many are resilient and courageous women and men, who are aware of the possible risks of exploitation but, impelled by the lack of viable job opportunities at home and the pressing needs of their families, have nevertheless made their individual decisions to travel abroad in search of work."" Confined, beaten, raped . Domestic workers are particularly vulnerable because their isolation in private homes, without inspections, makes them more vulnerable to exploitation and forced labor, the ILO said. Among the conditions they may face are: being denied proper time off; being confined to their place of work; being placed under surveillance; being made to live in degrading conditions, like sleeping in a kitchen or hallway; or having their identity papers confiscated or wages withheld so they can't leave. In more extreme cases, they may be subject to physical and sexual violence. A Filipina domestic worker in Lebanon told the ILO she was caught after trying to escape by climbing out over the balcony. ""My employer broke my elbow and then tied my hands behind my back. They left me one day long in my room and put a camera there. He threatened me: 'I'll accuse you of stealing money and ask for my money back, and they will throw you in jail!'"" she is quoted as saying. Another Filipina domestic worker interviewed in a detention center in Kuwait told the ILO that her employer had raped her. ""I went to the doctors and filed a complaint at the police, and then returned to work the next day. He reported to the authorities that I had run away, and the police arrested me,"" she said. ""My employer tells me that if I drop the rape charges, he will make sure that I am not deported."" Even where anti-trafficking laws exist, prosecutions are few, so ""there is little to deter others from confining migrant workers in exploitative situations against their will,"" the ILO points out. Sex brokers . Meanwhile, those who are coerced into sex work within the entertainment industry face a ""real"" risk of violence, detention or deportation, the report said. ""Owners and managers of entertainment establishments, and sex brokers (pimps), do not hesitate to use threats of denunciation to the authorities and family repudiation, and actual psychological, physical and sexual violence, to intimidate their victims,"" the report says. ""The impossibility of leaving the exploiter is entrenched by the fact that women known to have engaged in sex work have limited opportunities to secure income by other means."" Asian and African women are particularly vulnerable to being deceived and coerced into sexual exploitation, the report said. Some are lured away from their original employers with promises of love or a better job, and then forced into sex work, while others are abducted on arrival and taken to underground brothels, or are tricked into thinking they have a job as a waitress or singer in a nightclub and then made to provide sexual services. In some cases, those running the sex rings are other migrant workers, often of the same nationality, the report said. Local sponsors may also be involved or turn a blind eye. ""Even though prostitution is legally forbidden in most countries of the Middle East, the commercial sex industry employing foreign women is unofficially tolerated,"" the report said. In part, this is because demand for sexual services is stubbornly high. In addition to the local demand, there are also large numbers of male migrant workers who are away from home for long periods and cannot fulfill their natural sex drive by legitimate means, the report says. A Nepalese client of sex workers is quoted as saying: ""I think the majority of women are forced to have sex. They are physically beaten, isolated and locked in the apartments. The clients are usually aware that the women are forced but are okay with this because they themselves are sexually deprived."" Some girls from Middle Eastern countries who are forced into marriage are also pushed into prostitution by their husbands, the report says. 'Forced into the desert' But while much attention focuses on the plight of women, male migrant workers in the construction, manufacturing, seafaring and agriculture sectors are also vulnerable to human trafficking, the report says. They ""are routinely deceived with respect to living and working conditions, the type of work to be performed, or even the existence of a job at all."" Some migrant workers reported having been recruited as domestic workers -- but then forced to tend animal herds in the desert. A ""runaway"" Sri Lankan shepherd interviewed in Kuwait told the ILO: ""I came to Kuwait to work as a driver and my employer took me across the border in Saudi Arabia for six months. ""I lived in a small steel hut with no air conditioning, no electricity and no shower or toilet. I was not allowed to kill the animals to feed myself. I was scared of my employer who tried to hit me but I said, 'If you hit me, I will hit you back.'"" Complex factors make it almost impossible for many to leave if it all goes wrong. Chief among these is the ""kafala,"" or sponsorship, system that governs most migrant workers in the region. This, the ILO says, is ""inherently problematic"" because it creates an unequal power dynamic between the employer and the worker. Many employers justify holding the passports of migrant workers because under the system they are legally responsible for the worker's residency and employment. They may also hold back wages -- meaning workers can't leave because they risk ending up with nothing -- or charge sky-high ""release"" fees to stop exploited workers from seeking jobs elsewhere. ""The system was not set up to create this extreme dependence between employers and workers,"" Andrees said. Positive changes . Of course, not every migrant worker has a bad experience, and for many the opportunity to work overseas delivers the promised escape from grinding poverty at home. The presence of migrant workers is also vital to the economies of many countries in the Middle East -- and in some, they outnumber the national workers substantially, the ILO points out. In Qatar, an astonishing 94% of workers are migrants, while in Saudi Arabia that figure is over 50%, the report says. Migrants also make up a significant part of the workforce in Jordan and Lebanon. The ILO report highlights some positive changes in the region, saying governments and other groups have stepped up efforts to combat forced labor and human trafficking in recent years, including through the passage of anti-trafficking legislation. But, it says, ""shortcomings persist in applying laws and prosecuting and convicting perpetrators of human trafficking."" It proposes an overhaul of the kafala system, suggesting that national ministries of labor should be in charge of the recruitment process, rather than agencies, and should handle complaints. The ILO also recommends extending legislation to protect all types of worker, the revision of employment contracts, beefing up inspections and ending wage discrimination.

"(CNN) -- A scholar of world religions writes a book about Jesus. A woman, whose politician husband is caught in a sex scandal twice, decides to stand by him. Nothing out of the ordinary. But two giants of American mainstream media -- one on the right, the other left-of-center -- have come under criticism this week for interpreting the actions of the two through glasses tainted with ethnic slant. A FoxNews.com interview segment was widely derided online when the anchor kept asking author Reza Aslan how a Muslim can write a book about Jesus. While Aslan patiently explains -- repeatedly -- that it's his scholastic expertise that qualifies him to do so, the anchor presses on with the same question. On the other end, New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd posited in an editorial that Huma Abedin continues to stay by the side of her philandering husband, Anthony Weiner, because of her alleged harsh upbringing in Saudi Arabia. Foxnews.com interview . Aslan spoke to Piers Morgan on Monday night about his experience on Fox. ""Truly, I was kind of embarrassed,"" he said. He felt uncomfortable having to repetitively parade his academic credentials by Fox anchor Lauren Green. ""You really come off as a jerk, when you do that,"" said Aslan, who holds three degrees in religion. He has studied the life of Jesus for 20 years and calls him his ""hero."" Green seemed wholly uninterested in Aslan's qualifications. Her first question set the tone for the rest of the conversation, in which she spent nearly 10 minutes casting religious doubt on his motivations for writing the book. ""You're a Muslim, so why did you write a book about the founder of Christianity?"" The video of the interview went viral, and Green's reduction of Aslan to his religion triggered a backlash on social media. ""reza aslan's interview on fox news was so painful to watch, he was basically being interviewed by a wall,"" said @nimbaaa on Twitter. Some lambasted Green for tenaciously skirting Aslan's academic credentials, posting satirical comparisons, like this one on Twitter from @RadhikaMadhani: . ""I'm a vet who has a Ph.D. in treating animals. Lauren Green: But you're a human. Reza Aslan: But I have a Ph.D..."" ""I have a Ph.D. in oceanography, I study the ocean. But you live on land. Yes, but my area of study is the ocean,"" tweeted @lamaquinapls in the same vein. Critics from established media joined in. The Los Angeles Times called the interview ""strange,"" adding that Green gave Aslan the ""proverbial third degree."" Slate.com called the interview ""cringe-worthy."" ""Is This The Most Embarrassing Interview Fox News Has Ever Done?"" BuzzFeed asked in a headline. Aslan told Morgan that he feels bad for Green. People get emotional, when academics write about their religion, fearing it is being attacked, he said. ""Nothing could be further from the truth. The most important people in my life are Christian -- my wife and my mother,"" he said. Aslan was born a Muslim but felt inspired by Christianity in his youth and converted, as he explains in an essay he wrote for CNN. ""When I was 15 years old, I found Jesus,"" he wrote. He later converted back to Islam, the religion of his ancestors. The Fox interview and subsequent media coverage have garnered his book more attention. On Monday, it was the bestselling title on Amazon. Times article . The New York Times' ethnic slant was less belabored. It didn't take up a 10-minute segment but instead just one single paragraph. Huma Abedin is a longtime aide of Hillary Clinton. Her husband, Anthony Weiner, has been caught twice sending explicit messages to women on social media. He was recently caught for the second time sending out lewd photos of himself. Abedin pledged her love for him at a news conference. Columnist Maureen Dowd explained Abedin's decision this way: ""Huma was raised in Saudi Arabia, where women are treated worse by men than anywhere else on the planet."" First, Abedin is not exactly Saudi Arabian. Her late father was from India; her mother from Pakistan. She was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan, but the family moved to Saudi Arabia when she was 2. She moved back to the United States to attend George Washington University. She began her Washington career as a White house intern, before working in Hillary Clinton's office, when Clinton was first lady. Some could not help but see the irony in the same situation connecting both women, in light of the Monica Lewinsky affair during the presidency of Bill Clinton. ""Commentary on Huma Abedin's ethnic reasons for standing by her man ignores the fact that her white boss Hillary Clinton did the same #Weiner,"" @SaeedShah posted to Twitter. Moroccan author and novelist Laila Lalami tweeted: . ""Maureen Dowd: Huma Abedin stands by Anthony Weiner because she was raised in Saudi Arabia. Remind me, where was Hillary Clinton raised?""","Fox News and The New York Times come under fire for ethnic slant .

"(CNN) -- Surveillance video shows Tucson shooting suspect Jared Loughner walking up to Rep. Gabrielle Giffords at a constituent event and firing point blank at her face, the Washington Post reported Tuesday, citing two sources who have seen the videos. The bullet from his 9mm Glock entered Giffords' head just above her left eye and exited from the back of her skull, the sources said. Giffords is in serious condition at University Medical Center in Tucson. A second, unnamed victim is listed in good condition, the hospital said. The videos showed that U.S. District Judge John Roll was killed while covering Giffords' district director Ron Barber, who was one of 13 people wounded in the January 8 shooting outside a Tucson supermarket, the Post's sources said. Six people, including Roll, were killed. The sources told the Post that Loughner fired 32 rounds -- one more than his 31-round magazine held. Investigators believe the 32nd round was already in the weapon's chamber when he loaded the magazine. Legislation banning the kind of multiple-round ammunition magazine used shootings was introduced Tuesday evening in the U.S. House. Democratic Rep. Carolyn McCarthy of New York introduced the measure banning ""large capacity"" ammunition magazines, defined as those that hold more than 10 rounds. Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, will introduce similar legislation in the Senate later this month. ""I know what it's like to have tragedy brought to your life in a split-second by a madman with high-capacity ammunition magazines,"" said McCarthy, whose husband was killed and son seriously wounded by a gunman on the Long Island Railroad in 1993. ""I'm working to stop it from happening again."" ""This nation has come together before to support this simple, common-sense measure, and it is the law in several states right now,"" she said Tuesday afternoon. ""It is a small sacrifice that law-abiding gun owners can make once again in order to increase everyone's safety."" The manufacture and sale of new large-capacity magazines were outlawed under the assault weapons ban that was in place from 1994 until 2004, when Congress let it expire under President George W. Bush. McCarthy's legislation would also apply to previously manufactured magazines. The measure includes exemptions for law enforcement and security purposes. ""High-capacity gun magazines are tools for murder,"" Lautenberg said. ""This common-sense legislation would make it more difficult for someone to carry out a killing spree."" The Washington Post report says that Loughner, 22, shot Giffords from about two or three feet away and then turned to his left, firing on people -- not shown in the video -- who were seated or standing in line for the event. Then, the sources told the paper, he turned back to his right and shot Barber, 65. ""Judge Roll starts to push Barber down on the ground and lay on top of Barber, and they start to scamper under the table, but Roll is on top,"" one source said, according to the newspaper. ""At that point, you can see the suspect shoot Roll. Roll gets shot in the back, then he sort of appears halfway on the other side of the table. He starts to look over his right shoulder, and then he lays back down. It took out his aorta is what the autopsy showed."" The sources said that video ends at that point, but others show Loughner firing until he runs out of ammunition, when he was tackled by people attending the event. Meanwhile, a law enforcement official said Tuesday that federal and local authorities have conducted more than 300 interviews with family members, friends, neighbors and others as part of the probe into the shooting. The number of federal personnel deployed in the investigation hit a high of about 250 people, including agents, analysts and evidence response teams, the official said. The FBI has substantial resources in Arizona and was able to supply about 200 of those people, the official said. An additional 50 people came from FBI offices in Washington, D.C., and Quantico, Virginia, and also from other federal law enforcement agencies such as the U.S. Marshals Service, the U.S. Capitol Police and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the official said. The total number has now dropped to less than 250 people, the official said. Local law agencies had assigned about 130 people to the investigation as well, but the official didn't know the current figure. The Washington Post reported the parents of alleged gunman Loughner have not been able to provide much information and have told authorities they had little recent contact with Jared. When asked about this, the official said the parents have been cooperative, but did not assess how useful their information has been in the investigation.

"(CNN) -- The Justice Department charged Toyota with wire fraud on Wednesday as part of a settlement with prosecutors that will require the auto giant to pay $1.2 billion for admittedly misleading consumers and the government over unintended acceleration. According to an agreement signed by the Japanese company, Toyota executives responded to initial complaints about sticking gas pedals and unwanted acceleration by deceiving the public and trying to find ways to limit damage to its global brand. Toyota at one point boasted internally about saving $100 million in costs by avoiding a full safety recall. That strategy continued even after a 2009 incident in which a family of four in San Diego was killed when their Lexus suddenly accelerated to speeds of 100 miles-per-hour and crashed, Justice Department officials said. Toyota wound up recalling millions of popular vehicles in 2009-10. Attorney General Eric Holder said Toyota ""confronted a public safety emergency as if it were a simple public relations problem."" The financial penalty is the largest for a car manufacturer and Justice Department officials said it represented an aggressive new strategy to deal with how companies handle safety recalls. Under the agreement, the Justice Department will defer the criminal charge for three years, during which Toyota will submit to government monitoring. The settlement ends a four-year probe by the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office, which is now looking at safety issues at General Motors. GM has recalled 1.6 million vehicles worldwide over an ignition switch problem. GM engineers apparently knew about it years ago but the Detroit automaker did not move to recall vehicles until last month. George Venizelos, FBI assistant director in charge of the bureau's New York office, blasted Toyota. ""The disregard Toyota had for the safety of the public is outrageous. Not only did Toyota fail to recall cars with problem parts, they continued to manufacture new cars with the same parts they knew were deadly,"" he said. According to the agreement, Toyota admitted to deceiving U.S. safety regulators and members of Congress who conducted a separate inquiry. Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said the company's deception even raised concerns among employees. Bharara noted that one employee, in January 2010, said in response to the company's misleading public statements: ""Idiots! Someone will go to jail if lies are repeatedly told. I can't support this."" Christopher Reynolds, chief legal officer for Toyota Motor North America said the company has made changes to be more responsive to customers. ""In the more than four years since these recalls, we have gone back to basics at Toyota to put our customers first,"" he said. The company has settled similar allegations over unintended acceleration in agreements with a group of states, and has also settled with some vehicle owners. The Transportation Department previously leveled stiff fines against Toyota for not promptly addressing safety problems related to unintended acceleration. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) also came under scrutiny during the Toyota saga for not pushing the company harder in the early stages of their investigation into motorist complaints. The recall crisis cost Toyota an estimated $2 billion in repair costs and lost sales, even before it had to pay out any legal settlements.","Japanese auto giant also charged with wire fraud, but prosecution deferred .

"Editor's note: David Paterson, a Democrat, is governor of New York. New York Gov. David Paterson says taxing soft drinks could help combat obesity. ALBANY, New York (CNN) -- Like many New Yorkers, I remember a time when nearly everyone smoked. In 1950, Collier's reported that more than three-quarters of adult men smoked. This epidemic had a devastating and long-lasting impact on public health. Today, we find ourselves in the midst of a new public health epidemic: childhood obesity. What smoking was to my parents' generation, obesity is to my children's generation. Nearly one out of every four New Yorkers under the age of 18 is obese. In many high-poverty areas, the rate is closer to one out of three. That is why, in the state budget I presented last Tuesday, I proposed a tax on sugared beverages like soda. Research has demonstrated that soft-drink consumption is one of the main drivers of childhood obesity. For example, a study by Harvard researchers found that each additional 12-ounce soft drink consumed per day increases the risk of a child becoming obese by 60 percent. For adults, the association is similar. If we are to succeed in reducing childhood obesity, we must reduce consumption of sugared beverages. That is the purpose of our proposed tax. We estimate that an 18 percent tax will reduce consumption by five percent. Our tax would apply only to sugared drinks -- including fruit drinks that are less than 70 percent juice -- that are nondiet. The $404 million this tax would raise next year will go toward funding public health programs, including obesity prevention programs, across New York state. The surgeon general estimates that obesity was associated with 112,000 deaths in the United States every year. Here in New York state, we spend almost $6.1 billion on health care related to adult obesity -- the second-highest level of spending in the nation. Last year, legitimate concerns about links between consumption of fast food and the prevalence of heart disease prompted New York City to ban the use of trans fats in restaurant food. No one can deny the urgency of reducing the rate of obesity, including childhood obesity. Obesity causes serious health problems like type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. It puts children at much greater risk for life-threatening conditions such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. We must never stigmatize children who are overweight or obese. Yet, for the sake of our children's health, we have an obligation to address this crisis. I believe we can ultimately curb the obesity epidemic the same way we curbed smoking: through smart public policy. In recent decades, anti-smoking campaigns have raised awareness. Smoking bans have been enacted and enforced. And, perhaps most importantly, we have raised the price of cigarettes. In June, New York state raised the state cigarette tax an additional $1.25. According to the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, this increase alone will prevent more than 243,000 kids from smoking, save more than 37,000 lives and produce more than $5 billion in health care savings. These taxes may be unpopular, but their benefits are undeniable. Last month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that, for the first time in generations, fewer than 20 percent of Americans smoked. Lung cancer rates have finally begun to decline. As a result, we are all healthier. Just as the cigarette tax has helped reduce the number of smokers and smoking-related deaths, a tax on highly caloric, non-nutritional beverages can help reduce the prevalence of obesity. To address the obesity crisis, we need more than just a surcharge on soda. We need to take junk food out of our schools. We need to encourage our children to exercise more. And we need to increase the availability of healthy food in underserved communities. But to make serious progress in this effort, we need to reduce the consumption of high-calorie drinks like nondiet soda among children and adults. I understand that New Yorkers may not like paying a surcharge for their favorite drinks. But surely it's a small price to pay for our children's health. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Paterson.","Gov. David Paterson: At one time, most American men smoked cigarettes .

"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier, Haiti's former dictator, returned unexpectedly Sunday to the country after some 25 years in exile, adding uncertainty into an already turbulent situation. Duvalier remained huddled inside his hotel Monday, as the reasons behind his visit and what he hoped to accomplish remained unclear. A scheduled press conference at his hotel was canceled at the last minute because the hotel was not equipped to handle the crowd, and no other location could be found, Henry Robert Sterlin, a Duvalier associate, told reporters. Sterlin said that the former dictator had returned because he was moved by the anniversary of last year's tragic earthquake, and because he missed his homeland. The associate said he did not know how long Duvalier was staying, and added that he was not afraid to come back. He arrived in the Haitian capital as the nation is grappling with a political crisis, sparked by fraud allegations in a presidential election. Duvalier, wearing a dark suit and tie, greeted supporters at the busy Port-au-Prince airport. He was traveling with his wife. The Duvalier family ruled Haiti for three decades starting in 1957, when Francois ""Papa Doc"" Duvalier was elected president. He later declared himself president for life. When he died in 1971, he was succeeded by his 19-year-old son, Jean-Claude ""Baby Doc"" Duvalier. The younger Duvalier held onto power for 15 years before a revolt forced him to flee the country. Widely accused of corruption, Duvalier has been living in France. Upon arriving in Haiti, the former dictator and his wife went to the Karibe Hotel, according to Ryan Flaherty, head of security for Project Medishare. Duvalier's wife was swarmed by people as she approached the hotel and said that her husband had decided to return to Haiti some time ago, Flaherty reported. ""There's definite energy in the air right now,"" he said, as he stood with a small crowd of Duvalier supporters outside of the hotel. ""Right now, people don't know what he's back here for. People don't know if he is just visiting, or if he's here to talk about the earthquake and relief ... or, is he going to make a political move?"" said Flaherty. ""It's just going to be interesting to hear what he has to say."" The United Nations restricted the movement of its staff in Port-au-Prince until further notice, or until the impact of the former leader's arrival becomes clear, said Patrick Hanson, a security officer for the United Nations in Haiti. While groups of people have gathered in various parts of the city, they are calm and no violence has been reported, he said. Last week, Haiti marked the first anniversary of a devastating earthquake that left more than 200,000 people dead. The January 12 anniversary of the catastrophe, as Haitians call it, comes as the Caribbean nation faces new crises: a cholera epidemic that has killed more than 3,700 people and a political impasse sparked by allegations of election fraud in the nation's presidential balloting. Haiti's Provisional Electoral Council released preliminary election results in early December that showed former first lady Mirlande Manigat 31.4 with percent of the vote. Jude Celestin, President Rene Preval's handpicked successor, came in second with 22.3 percent, while popular musician Michel Martelly was third with 21.8 percent. However, a review of the results, conducted by an Organization of American States monitoring team, showed Martelly winning 22.2 percent of the vote to Celestin's 21.9 percent, affording Martelly a spot in a runoff election with Manigat. A runoff, originally scheduled for Sunday, was postponed. Haiti's constitution mandates a new presidential term starting on February 7, but it is unclear whether that will happen. Anges Pierre-Louis, a local business owner, said Haitians are anxiously waiting to see what the government will do next, now that Duvalier has returned. ""There are so many parties here and so many mixed feelings that it's really hard to know who to turn to at the moment,"" she said. ""We don't know what the next week or the next couple of days will bring.""

"(CNN) -- After months of being beat up by the media about his ""Bridgegate"" scandal in New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie is still standing. And there is even some evidence that he might finally be regaining ground. A new poll from Quinnipiac shows that the governor has narrowed the lead that Hillary Clinton, another possible presidential candidate, has over him in Iowa. His appearance on ""The Tonight Show"" and at a charity softball game in Yankee Stadium generated some media buzz about the more likeable parts of his personality. Although his political reputation is a long way from repaired, the idea that the governor might still run in 2016 is back on the table. How can this be? A number of factors have helped him absorb the continued blows that he has received from the constant news coverage and ongoing investigations into the events that transpired in the Garden State. The dynamics of the scandal have followed a few principles about surviving scandal politics that have worked in his favor. 1. Avoid the smoking gun: This is the biggest one. Until investigators have clear-cut evidence that a politician is responsible for the scandal at hand, there is always room for a person to maneuver. In certain cases, American voters are willing to give the benefit of doubt to the person accused -- especially in a heated partisan environment where investigations and accusations often turn out to be unfounded -- until there is evidence in hand that the politician is guilty beyond any doubt. Whether the evidence is a recording of White House conversations (Watergate) or pictures on Twitter (Weinergate), it's not usually over before this information actually emerges. The absence of a smoking gun of illegal activity has been very important in this case since, to many Americans, so much of the story -- leaning on politicians, favoring friends and intimidating enemies, making politics a top concern among the staff -- all seem like politics as usual in New Jersey. 2. Time your scandal well: As with everything else in politics, timing is everything when it comes to scandal. It matters very much when a story breaks. With Christie, the timing was good and bad. The revelations about the bridge began at a real high point for the governor when the media was virtually nominating him to be the Republican nominee on their own. So the impact of negative information was dramatic. But the story also broke a long time before any presidential primaries started. There is a huge amount of time still remaining until the political season really begins. This means that Christie has had some time for the noise to die down and the worst of the coverage, thus far, has taken place when nationally many people are not paying attention. The virtues of the scandal happening early are amplified in a rapid-fire media age where reporters turn their attention to the next big story quickly and the readers and viewers are quick to move on. 3. Keep governing: Christie has followed the Bill Clinton playbook. When faced with bad press and damaging allegations, keep doing the job that you were elected to do. During the past months, Christie has continued to focus on his work in New Jersey. He has been steadfast in his effort to convey the image of a politician most concerned about the challenges facing the electorate rather than the challenges he faces as a result of the scandal. He has also used his fundraising and appearances with the Republican Governors Association to continue to remind voters and member of the party of the assets that he can bring to the table as a party leader. By doing so, he continues to give the public opportunity to evaluate him a leader in action, rather than just the subject of investigation, and to charge that the accusers are more concerned in scandal than solving problems. 4. Remind your party that they need you: One of Christie's greatest virtues is his party. Even with all the problems that President Barack Obama has faced, the GOP remains greatly damaged. The party has suffered in the polls as a result the way in which Republicans have governed in Congress, as well as continued disapproval of President George W. Bush. Many of the possible candidates, such as Rand Paul or Marco Rubio, are untested or have serious potential weaknesses, such as Paul's noninterventionism at a moment that things are heating up overseas. Christie receives considerable protection just from the fact that Republicans don't have so many alternatives. Desperate to regain the White House, Republicans have been willing to give him some slack as the story unfolds. To be sure, it is far from clear whether Christie will ever regain the strength he once had. The recent news about a second scandal involving alleged securities laws violations connected to a major road repair might rekindle public interest in his wrongdoing and potentially produce the smoking gun that has not yet emerged. But at this point, Christie is still showing some signs of life and remains a player on the political field. He still has the potential to join the list of politicians who have stared scandal in the face and survived politically. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","Julian Zelizer observes how Gov.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's father filed a wrongful death lawsuit in federal court against Dr. Conrad Murray on Friday, the anniversary of the pop star's death, Joe Jackson's lawyer said. The suit alleges that Murray gave paramedics and doctors false information about the ""polypharmacy"" of drugs Michael Jackson had been given and hindered efforts to revive him in an ambulance and at UCLA Medical Center, according to a copy obtained by CNN. The suit said that ""other parties responsible for Michael Jackson's death"" would be added but that the plaintiff ""has not yet gathered sufficient information regarding their potential liability or responsibility."" A complaint filed by Joe Jackson with the California medical board this month also named AEG, the company that was producing his son's comeback concerts. Murray was hired to serve as Jackson's personal doctor two months before the London debut of the concerts were set. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled that Michael Jackson's death was caused by an overdose of propofol, a powerful anesthesia that Murray has acknowledged the pop star used to help him sleep. Joe Jackson attorney Brian Oxman obtained a court order this year giving him medical records from UCLA Medical Center, where Michael Jackson died on June 25, 2009. The suit also alleges that Murray delayed calling for paramedics for over an hour, after he found Jackson not breathing minutes after he injected him with propofol to help him fall asleep. The suit contends that Murray used the time to hide evidence of drugs he had been giving Jackson. When the ambulance carrying Michael Jackson from his home arrived at the emergency room at 1:13 p.m., he was identified as ""Soule Shaun,"" the suit said. He had ""no pulse, blood pressure, spontaneous respiration or heartbeat,"" it said. Murray, who had taken over control of resuscitation efforts from paramedics, said nothing to emergency room doctors about the propofol or ""other drugs"" he had given Michael Jackson earlier in the day, it said. It quoted a report written the next day by one of those doctors, who wrote that Murray told them ""the patient had been working long hours but had not been ill."" ""The only reported medications reported for the patient were valium and Flomax,"" Dr. Richelle Cooper wrote. ""There is no history of drug use by the patient as reported by Dr. Murray."" A police report said Murray told investigators two days later that ""he was afraid Michael Jackson was addicted to propofol."" ""He had a history of addiction, and the defendant was trying to wean him off the drugs, yet he told Dr. Cooper two days earlier that Michael Jackson had no drug use history,"" the suit said. The toxicology results included in the autopsy report said the propofol level found in Michael Jackson's body was equal to what would be used to sedate a patient for major surgery. Murray, who has been charged with involuntary manslaughter in Michael Jackson's death, did not give him that much of the anesthesia, his defense lawyer said recently. ""There is no way that Dr. Murray pumped Michael Jackson full of propofol sufficient for major surgery,"" attorney Ed Chernoff said. ""No way. I would stake anything that I own on this fact."" The lawsuit contends that Jackson showed ""neurological, pulmonary, and amnesia signs"" in his final weeks as he rehearsed in Los Angeles for the London shows. It said Jackson borrowed jackets from others and used a heater at rehearsals ""to control the shivering."" ""In May and June, 2009, Michael Jackson was confused, easily frightened, unable to remember, obsessive, and disoriented,"" the suit said. ""He has impaired memory, a loss of appetite, and absence of energy. He was cold and shivering during the summer rehearsals for his show, and as shown in photographs and motion pictures of him, he uncharacteristically wore heavy clothing during the rehearsals, while other dancers wore scant clothing and were perspiring from the heat.""

"Mexico City (CNN) -- Investigators exhumed the mother of one of Mexico's most notorious cartel kingpins Monday, two weeks after thieves apparently made off with her son's body before authorities could conclusively confirm his identity. Now they plan to do DNA tests to verify that the man they killed in a gunbattle earlier this month was Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano, leader of the Zetas drug cartel, Mexico's attorney general's office said. Masked federal police Monday guarded the cemetery in central Mexico that houses the mausoleum containing the remains of Lazcano's mother, Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency reported. Photos: Mexico drug war desperation . It was the latest chapter in a dramatic saga that has cast a cloud of mystery over what could be one of the biggest accomplishments of outgoing President Felipe Calderon's crackdown on cartels. Mexican authorities have said they have no doubt they killed Lazcano, thanks to fingerprints and photograph evidence. But additional tests will allow them to reach 100% legal certainty, prosecutors said. ""Taking tissue samples (from a direct family member) is necessary to complete laboratory studies of the genetic fingerprint, according to the most modern and advanced protocols for identifying people,"" the office said. On October 8, authorities proudly trumpeted the death of Lazcano, who was known as ""El Lazca."" The next day, they revealed they no longer had his body; gunmen had stolen it from a funeral home. They also said that members of Mexico's navy shot him dead without realizing that the man in the suspicious car they'd chased outside a local baseball game on a Sunday afternoon was the head of the ruthless Zetas cartel. Mexican navy: Zetas leader captured . ""Two people were killed, but for us, they were just two more criminals. We had no clue that it was El Lazca,"" Vice Adm. Jose Luis Vergara, a spokesman for the navy, said in an interview with MVS Radio shortly after authorities announced the news. Vergara said investigators thought he was ""a criminal, not even a capo, most likely a hit man in the town or something like that."" Officials said a fingerprint match after the autopsy confirmed he was the man Mexico's president described as ""one of the most important and most dangerous"" people on the country's list of most wanted criminals. The United States and Mexico combined had offered rewards of more than $7 million for information leading to his capture. Lazcano was a onetime special forces soldier who became a founding member of the Zetas, a group accused of some of the most violent atrocities that have come to define the drug war. Lazcano, 37, joined the Mexican armed forces in 1991 and was part of its elite airborne special forces group, dedicated to battling drug cartels. Soon after, Lazcano and several other special forces members were recruited by the Gulf cartel to create its enforcement arm, the Zetas. Zetas' founder sentenced to 35 years . After the partnership ended in 2010, the Zetas split into a major drug trafficking organization and have since branched out into extortion, kidnapping and human smuggling. Analysts have said it is unclear what impact Lazano's death will have on the Zetas. The cartel had been in the midst of a bloody turf war with its former employer, the Gulf cartel, and also with the Sinaloa cartel. The fight for access to lucrative smuggling routes in northern and central Mexico has left thousands of civilians dead. Mexican authorities: Suspect arrested in Falcon Lake killing .

"(CNN) -- Here's a roundup of five medical studies published this week that might give you new insights into your health, mind and body. Remember, correlation is not causation -- so if a study finds a connection between two things, it doesn't mean that one causes the other. Extreme obesity shortens your life more than smoking . Journal: PLOS Medicine . It's not going to come as a surprise that obesity shortens your life by contributing to heart disease, strokes, diabetes and other diseases. But how many years are lost? Researchers from the National Cancer Institute compared normal weight smokers to extremely obese non-smokers. They found the smokers lived longer on average. Healthy weight smokers lost about nine years of their lives. Non-smoking adults who were extremely obese -- defined as having a BMI of 55 to 55.9 -- lost nearly 14 years on average. Researchers analyzed 20 large studies, which included more than 9,500 extremely obese adults and more than 300,000 people with a normal BMI. Participants came from the United States, Sweden and Australia. The findings, published Tuesday in PLOS Medicine, highlight the need to develop more effective ways to combat the growing public health problem of extreme obesity, the authors write. Simple blood test may predict Alzheimer's . Journal: Alzheimer's & Dementia . According to the Alzheimer's Association, 44 million people live with dementia worldwide. That number is expected to triple in just 35 years. Alzheimer's is usually diagnosed when the disease has progressed. While there's no cure, early detection could lead to early intervention, which may slow the disease. And a simple blood test could be the key, according new study published Thursday in Alzheimer's & Dementia, a journal of the Alzheimer's Association. Researchers used blood samples from 1,148 people. Ten proteins in the blood were found to predict whether people with mild cognitive impairment would develop Alzheimer's within a year. As promising this new test appears to be, the Alzheimer's Association says it isn't ready for the doctor's office yet. ""To give the findings credibility, they need to be replicated by other researchers in larger, more diverse populations. "" Over 55? You too can donate a kidney . Journal: American Journal of Transplantation . People in need of a kidney often wait years for a deceased donor match. Another option is a live kidney donation. But many times potential live donors are excluded because of their age. It's been thought that older live kidney donors have a higher risk of heart disease after donating their organ. That's not true anymore, according to a new study in the American Journal of Transplantation. Researchers matched 3,368 older donors with older healthy non-donors and followed them for nearly eight years. They found that kidney donors older than 55 are at no greater risk for death or cardiovascular disease than non-donors. Combo approach may help smokers quit . Journal: JAMA . Smokers looking to quit often use either a medication named Chantix or nicotine patches, hoping it will help reduce withdrawal symptoms. But a combination of those two methods improves the odds you'll quit smoking on the short term, according to a study published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The study was funded by the companies that make Chantix and nicotine patches. Researchers randomly assigned 446 smokers to either take Chantix and a nicotine patch, or Chantix plus a placebo patch. Treatment continued for 14 weeks. Twelve weeks later, 55% of those who took both medications were still not smoking, compared to 41% of those on Chantix alone. After six months, the numbers were 49% and 32.6% respectively. The researchers also found a greater incidence of nausea, disturbed sleep, skin reactions and depression in the combination group. They say safety and long-term efficacy needs to be assessed by further studies. Don't pressure your doctor after a concussion . Journal: Neurology . After a concussion, doctors often receive pressure from their young patients, families and coaches to give an athlete the ""all-clear"" as soon as possible. But that's dangerous, says the American Academy of Neurology. The reason: Concussions are linked to long-term impairments in brain function. A new position statement published in the journal Neurology on Wednesday calls for doctors to only give an athlete the ""all-clear"" to play when medically ready. ""Physicians should be thoughtful about athletes going back to field after brain injury,"" says neurologist Dr. Daniel Larriviere, one of the study authors. Doctors caring for athletes with sports-related concussions should have adequate training and experience and also educate patients and their families about the dangers of concussion, the authors conclude. The Academy is also calling for a national registry the will require mandatory reporting of concussions.","Extreme obesity shortens your life more than smoking .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama told Hispanic leaders and immigration reform activists Thursday that despite frustrations with the delays in fixing the country's immigration system, he's going to need them to have his back. After punting on taking executive action on immigration until after the midterms, Obama pledged Thursday evening at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute that he will act on immigration before the end of the year. ""The moment I act -- and it will be taking place between the November election and the end of the year -- opponents of reform will roll out the same old scare tactics,"" Obama said. ""And when opponents are out there saying who knows what, I'm going to need you to have my back."" Obama was interrupted by one heckler that The Hill newspaper identified as Blanca Hernandez, an undocumented immigrant activist, who shouted ""we need relief now"" and was escorted out by security. Obama emphasized Thursday that he can't accomplish real, long-term change without what he called the ""powerful"" Latino vote. ""Si se puede, si votamos. Yes we can, if we vote,"" Obama told the crowd to applause. That rallying call, reminiscent of his 2008 campaign slogan, piles on top of Democratic efforts to mobilize lackluster Latinos who appear less likely to support Democrats in November despite strong backing in recent cycles, according to the Washington Post. ""Nothing I can do will be as comprehensive or lasting as the Senate bill. Anything I can do can be reversed by the next President,"" Obama said. While Obama pushed back his plans for executive action this summer and a bipartisan Senate bill on immigration reform last year failed to pick up steam in the House, Obama insisted that his administration has done a lot to benefit Latinos in his nearly six years in office. Obama rattled off a list of campaign promises that he said he has kept: from confronting ""the crisis of overcrowded classrooms and underfunded schools"" to fixing the ""broken health care system that left one out of three Hispanics uninsured."" ""The progress we've made has been hard. Sometimes it's been slower than we want, but that progress has been steady and it has been real. We have big things together and we're going to do more,"" Obama said. And fixing immigration reform falls under that category of ""more."" ""Fixing our broken immigration system is one more big thing that we have to do and that we will do,"" Obama said.","Obama pledged to take action on immigration reform by the end of the year.

"(EW.com) -- On the heels of reports that NBC is considering a creative restart on ""The Office,"" comes last night's ratings: The comedy veteran fell to a series low while facing a repeat of CBS' ""The Big Bang Theory"" in the 9 p.m. hour. What's interesting is CBS trying out ""Big Bang"" in this slot for the first time on a non-holiday (and a ""2 Broke Girls"" repeat at 9:30 p.m.). After CBS launched its 8 p.m. comedy hour beachhead on Thursdays, many wondered if it was Phase 1 in a master plan to have a two-hour comedy block on TV's most lucrative night for advertising. If Thursday is any indication, there's potential should CBS want to shake things up in the fall: ""The Big Bang Theory"" repeat (10.3 million viewers, 3.0 adult demo rating) won its time slot, beating fellow comedy ""The Office"" (4.4 million, 2.1), which fell 13 percent from its last original four weeks ago. ""The Big Bang Theory"" 9 p.m. repeat also performed stronger than its 8 p.m. repeat (2.8 in the demo), which you would expect given the higher audience levels in the hour. CBS' repeat of ""2 Broke Girls"" (7.3 million, 2.1) also beat the finale of NBC's ""Up All Night"" (3.2 million, 1.5).

"(CNN) -- Shilling etiquette advice is an old and illustrious profession. As long as there's been a society, there's also been appropriate social behavior (and a goodly number of schmucks who do everything wrong). We've come a long way since the 17th-century, court-appointed rules of courtesy, but things haven't actually changed that much since Emily Post, the maven of manners herself, published ""Etiquette"" in 1922. She didn't exactly see our modern array of technology coming (""With a hair-pin and a visiting card,"" she wrote, ""(a woman) is ready to meet most emergencies.""), but her do's and don'ts feel surprisingly modern. Here are some gems from the delightfully wry brain of an etiquette hero, and our takes on their modern translations. Then: ""A gentleman never discusses his family affairs either in public or with acquaintances, nor does he speak more than casually about his wife. A man is a cad who tells anyone, no matter who, what his wife told him in confidence, or describes what she looks like in her bedroom. To impart details of her beauty is scarcely better than to publish her blemishes; to do either is unspeakable."" Now: Emily could have been speaking directly to Mark Zuckerberg here, moments before he began that really mean blog post tearing apart the chick from ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo."" The audience to such flagrant meanness was once a bro's smoking buddies; now it's anyone with an Internet connection and the ability to Google. Taking to one's social-media channels to speak ill of a co-worker, friend or lover remains, well, unspeakable. Vent your frustrations with old-fashioned gossip or scrawl criticism in a diary or in a personal e-mail instead of hitting ""publish."" Then: ""The letter you write, whether you realize it or not, is always a mirror which reflects your appearance, taste and character. A 'sloppy' letter with the writing all pouring into one corner of the page, badly worded, badly spelled, and with unmatched paper and envelope -- even possibly a blot -- proclaims the sort of person who would have unkempt hair, unclean linen and broken shoe laces; just as a neat, precise, evenly written note portrays a person of like characteristics. ""Therefore, while it cannot be said with literal accuracy that one may read the future of a person by study of his handwriting, it is true that if a young man wishes to choose a wife in whose daily life he is sure always to find the unfinished task, the untidy mind and the syncopated housekeeping, he may do it quite simply by selecting her from her letters."" Now: Zing! Sexist guilt trips aside, Emily's onto something here. Yes, e-mail and spell check and digital fonts that reveal nothing of your atrocious handwriting have really taken away some of the hand-wringing over correspondence. But that means it's all the more important that you send clean, unblemished e-mails. Horrific spelling, atrocious grammar, missing punctuation, wingdings galore -- all just as bad as said inkblot. Then: ""When you have been staying over Sunday, or for longer, in someone's house, it is absolutely necessary that you write a letter of thanks to your hostess within a few days after the visit ... Don't be afraid that your (thank you note to your spouse's/friend's parents) is too informal; older people are always pleased with any expressions from the young that seem friendly and spontaneous. ""Never think, because you cannot easily write a letter, that it is better not to write at all. The most awkward note that can be imagined is better than none -- for to write none is the depth of rudeness, whereas the awkward note merely fails to delight."" Now: Thank you notes are hard! They were hard 90 years ago, too! And now some of them can come via e-mail so you have no excuse whatsoever for sulking into the ether without a little gratitude-based follow-up. Just bang something out. Let it be awkward. It's the gesture, not the content, that helps, and homegirl's got a point: A conversational note can make an old person feel more hip, less hip-replacement-seeking. Then: There are only two forms of farewell: ""Good-bye"" and ""Good night."" Never say ""Au revoir"" unless you have been talking French, or are speaking to a French person. Never interlard your conversation with foreign words or phrases when you can possibly translate them into English; and the occasions when our mother tongue will not serve are extremely rare. Now: In our digital dealings, the problem is less about foreign phrases (a friendly ""Merci!"" is better than no thank you at all to the intern who just spent four hours doing data entry for you). Rather, the issue is LOLspeak -- the ugly Internet-bred lexicon that Emily couldn't have seen coming. In nine out of 10 e-mails, posts and other missives, a spelled out word will be clearer and less idiotic-sounding than its abbreviated synonym. (This rule does not apply to hilar advice columns of the world, obvi. Hey, YOLO.)","Etiquette advice is as old as society, and Emily Post was ""maven of manners""
Much of her guidance can be updated to Internet age, Brenna Ehrlich and Andrea Bartz say .
E-mails full of poor grammar and spelling have supplanted poor penmanship, they say .
""Thank you"" notes are still important, even if they're digital, the two say ."
"(CNN) -- President Obama soon will nominate a new director of national intelligence, a position originally envisioned as overseer of the entire U.S. intelligence community. Dennis Blair, a retired Navy admiral, resigned as Obama's intelligence director Thursday. In the days before his resignation, Blair had responded to a Senate committee report's criticism by saying that ""institutional and technological barriers remain that prevent seamless sharing of information"" among the 16 agencies he oversaw. And that's the problem, a former White House homeland security adviser said Friday. Fran Townsend, a CNN contributor who was a homeland security adviser during the Bush administration, said the director's position lacks the authority to match its responsibilities. ""They either have to fix it or do away with it, but one way or another, what we don't need it to be is just an added layer of bureaucracy that impedes progress, especially when we have such serious threats out there,"" Townsend said on CNN's ""American Morning."" Congress created the position in 2004 as part of an intelligence overhaul recommended by the 9/11 Commission. John Negroponte, ambassador to Iraq, became the first director in April 2005 and held the position until February 2007, when he became deputy secretary of state. J. Mike McConnell, a retired Navy vice admiral, succeeded Negroponte and served until a week after President Obama's inauguration, when Blair took over. According its website, ""the Office of the DNI's goal is to effectively integrate foreign, military and domestic intelligence in defense of the homeland and of United States interests abroad."" However, the legislation that created the post did not invest it with authority to direct the budgets of any of the 16 intelligence agencies or tell them what to do. Before the director position was created, the director of central intelligence called most of the shots, and CIA directors have continued to wield considerable power, generating tension with the DNI. Time: Position not well defined or well rewarded . ""Anytime you have organizations that have similar interests, you're going to have disputes,"" McConnell said on his way out the door. ""And particularly if the two leaders aren't working together and having a partnership and so on, the warfare at the trench level gets to be pretty much a raging battle."" McConnell said he had a good professional relationship with then-CIA director Mike Hayden, so they made it work. But, he said, ""We don't have a department of intelligence. If this were the Department of Defense, there wouldn't be any question, but it isn't."" Blair's resignation is said to be the result of a power struggle with CIA director Leon Panetta. But even Panetta seemed unclear on the intelligence hierarchy during his Senate confirmation hearing in 2009. Initially, Panetta said he reported to the DNI and performed the tasks assigned to him by the DNI, but then he said: ""We are an operational arm, just like the [National Security Agency], just like the [National Reconnaissance Office], and I believe the role of the DNI is to coordinate all our activities."" In fact, the NSA and the NRO are part of the Defense Department and report directly to the defense secretary, not the DNI. The CIA is the only intelligence agency that is not part of another department. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, asked him directly, ""Is the DNI your boss or not?"" ""The DNI is my boss,"" Panetta answered. CNN National Security Producer Pam Benson and writer Jim Kavanagh contributed to this report.","Just-vacated position has responsibility but little clout .
Job was created on recommendation of 9/11 Commission .

"(CNN) -- Three teens admitted to police they attacked two homeless men who were found dead in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on Saturday, police said. The boys -- 15, 16 and 18 -- used bricks and a metal pole to kill the men, according to a criminal complaint accusing each of them of two counts of murder. A judge set bond at $5 million each during a hearing Monday. All three are being prosecuted as adults, although the two youngest are being held in a youth detention center. The 15-year-old told an investigator that the trio ""randomly"" attacked homeless people throughout Albuquerque over past year, including more than 50 people since moving to the neighborhood several months ago, the complaint said. The bodies of two men were found on mattresses in a field across a street from the home where two of the boys lived, according to the complaint. A third man told police he managed to escape the late night attack and he recognized the teens despite the T-shirts covering their heads. The youngest boy said he ""was very angry over breaking up with his long-time girlfriend"" when he went with the older boys to ""mob"" the men, an investigator said in a sworn statement. The boy explained that "" 'mob' meant they were going to attack them and rob them,"" the detective said. He told police that they used ""several cinder blocks, a metal pole and some sticks"" in the hourlong attack, the detective said. The 15-year-old ""admitted to using the cinder block as a weapon over 10 times,"" he said. The 15-year-old said his brother, 16, ""scooped up some dirt from the ground and placed on the deceased males' faces and stated 'eat mud bitch,' "" the complaint said. The 16-year-old told a detective that ""afterwards he looked at himself in the mirror and 'saw the devil,'"" according to the complaint. The oldest teen distanced himself from the most brutal details of the attack, accusing the other boys of using ""bricks, sticks and a metal fence pole"" to hit the men while he ""acted as a lookout,"" the complaint said. The 18-year-old did admit ""to pushing down one of the subjects and picking up a stick near where the deceased subjects were located,"" it said.

"(CNN) -- People have been pretty amazing lately. Sometimes these stories get buried underneath the daily clutter of social media updates, news programs and workplace conversations. But we noticed. And decided it's just not fair to keep all this goodness to ourselves. So here are 5 examples of humans being awesome. We hope it brightens your weekend. 1. Cop buys suspected shoplifter $100 worth of groceries . The Florida police officer who bought groceries for a shoplifter and her children says she did it ""just because I needed to."" ""She touched me,"" Miami-Dade Police Officer Vicki Thomas told CNN. ""I could relate,"" Thomas said. ""I was a single mom and, without the help of my family, that could have been me."" Thomas' act of generosity made national news and brought offers of help to the woman in need, Jessica Robles, and even a possible job opportunity. Robles told CNN affiliate WSVN she was desperate and had no money to pay for groceries for her daughter and two young sons. According to Miami-Dade Police, Robles walked out of a Publix supermarket in late September with a cart carrying $300 worth of groceries. She hadn't paid for them. Thomas looked at Robles' criminal history and didn't find any major charges, WSVN reported. Instead of being taken into custody, Robles was issued a notice to appear in court and charged with a misdemeanor. Thomas decided -- in addition to telling Robles about food banks, churches and other places she could get food -- she was going to help Robles and her family. ""I made the decision to buy her some groceries because arresting her wasn't going to solve the problem with her children being hungry,"" she said. 2. Customers refuse tip to server, other patrons rally around him . A waiter was thanked for his excellent service during a recent meal at Carrabba's Italian Grill in Overland Park, Kansas. But that thank you came with an anti-gay message, and without a tip. The man and his mother, who also works as a hostess told affiliate KCTV, they were very upset by what was written on the back of the check earlier this week after he waited on a couple. The note read, ""Thank you for your service, it was excellent. That being said, we cannot in good conscience tip you, for your homosexual lifestyle is an affront to GOD. (Homosexual slur) do not share in the wealth of GOD, and you will not share in ours,"" the customer wrote. ""We hope you will see the tip your (homosexual slur) choices made you lose out on, and plan accordingly. It is never too late for GOD's love, but none shall be spared for (homosexual slur). May GOD have mercy on you."" Since word has spread through social media, other customers are coming in to offer words of encouragement and tip the young server extra. 3. Contagious kindness at Minnesota Dairy Queen . A beloved family doctor from Chaska, Minnesota, loved his patients and his ice cream. When he died, to honor his memory, his family visited their pop's favorite Dairy Queen and gave $200 to pay for everybody's treat, a sweet reminder of the man they loved. Then, the people who received that free ice cream, paid it forward, too. Customers spent $700 for everybody for the entire day. In a great coincidence, the Dairy Queen clerk was Joey Prusak. He's the young manager who saw a customer steal a blind man's money, and refused to serve her unless she gave it back. When she wouldn't, he dipped into his own pocket to help and Warren Buffet called him with praise. 4. Dog's best friend: Woman carried injured dog down mountain . Andi Davis had no idea her regular hike would wind up making national news. Davis had hiked about a half mile uphill last Friday, October 18, along a deserted trail in Phoenix when she found the black and white pit bull, suffering from bullet wounds, said Arizona Humane Society spokeswoman Bretta Nelson in an e-mail. She hesitated for a moment before approaching the dog, Nelson said. But when he lifted his head as she reached for her water bottle, Davis put her apprehension aside, gave him a drink and then lifted the 47-pound dog into her arms, Nelson said. Then, she began walking. And she kept going until the dog was in the hands of veterinarians. 5. Oklahoma mother issues wallet thief an ultimatum . We saved the best for last. An Oklahoma mother of four is in the spotlight this week after she turned the tables on a man whom she believed stole her wallet. Jessica Eaves from Guthrie, Oklahoma, said she was grocery shopping earlier this month when she noticed that her wallet was missing. Instead of calling for help, she told affiliate KOCO, she handled the situation on her own. ""I approached him and said, 'Sir, my wallet's missing out of my purse and you were the only other person in the aisle,'"" Eaves said. She gave the man an ultimatum. Eaves told him he could either give her the wallet back and she would buy him some groceries or she would take his photo and call the police. ""He just kind of stared at me for a second and he reached into his hoodie pocket and handed it to me,"" Eaves said. After she purchased $27 worth of groceries, Eaves said the man started crying and apologized for his desperate act. ""The last thing he said to me was, 'I'm embarrassed, I have kids, I'm broke and I'm sorry,'"" she told KOCO. Do you have an example of someone being awesome you think is worth sharing?

"(CNN) -- Author Tim Federle has just wrapped a long day at the Atlanta Junior Theater festival, working with several thousand boys and girls who dream of stardom on the Broadway stage. Count these kids as lucky; they've found the perfect mentor. Federle has danced in several big Broadway shows and a Super Bowl halftime show and worked as a choreographer with the young dancers of the hit musical ""Billy Elliot,"" and now he's written his first novel, ""Better Nate Than Ever."" Despite his long day, an energetic Federle says, ""I think I was always a kid with his head in the clouds,"" which is appropriate since his book is about dreaming big. In his novel, Nate Foster is a teenager who loves musical theater. Feeling a bit like an outsider at school, he escapes small-town Pennsylvania and hops a bus to New York, where he hopes to land a part in ""E.T.: The Musical"" and get back home before his parents find out. The story is full of humor, a positive message and some Broadway insider moments. The book bears more than a passing resemblance to Federle's own life, but he says, ""For legal purposes, enough is different that I don't think my mom is going to sue me."" For Nate and for Federle, a love of musical theater is what sets them apart from their classmates, but it's also their life-saver. ""Musicals felt like a place where I could express myself in a safe way, even if my feelings were a little bit too big for school or home. It was the one place I really felt like, there's lights, there's scenery, and finally everything around me feels as big as my dreams,"" Federle said. Whether it's musical theater, sports or academics, Federle encourages young people to find that thing that makes them unique and hold on to it, because it could very well be their ticket to greatness and success as an adult. ""I think so often when you're a kid, we mellow out those more interesting edges in order to coast through middle school quietly. By the time you get to high school, you're left asking, who the heck am I? I would encourage kids to try and figure out the thing that sets you apart, not publicly but that you're passionate about internally."" Watch a video from Tim Federle about his new novel, ""Better Nate Than Ever"" Federle hopes readers find ""Nate"" especially relevant in a day where many kids who want to perform on stage are bullied or picked on for being different. ""Every time I think we've gotten past the point where it's weird to be a boy who performs, a girl who doesn't quite fit in, I turn on the news, and I see another tragic story of a kid who couldn't quite face what it felt to be alive amidst a group of kids who just didn't get them or wouldn't leave them alone. That tells me we can never have enough voices and mentors and stories."" While Federle ultimately made his Broadway dreams come true, after 10 years performing on stage, he found himself closing in on his 30th birthday and feeling like he was stuck in a creative rut. He thought about writing a novel but wasn't sure he was up to the challenge. It was his work as a choreographer on ""Billy Elliot,"" preparing young performers for a starring role on Broadway, that helped him conquer his own fears. ""Here I was about to turn 30, telling these kids to face their greatest fear and go out on stage for more than a thousand people who had all paid to see them play the title role in a Broadway show, and I wasn't facing my own fear, which was to try writing."" Federle made a vow a week before he turned 30 to write a novel. Thirty days later, he had his first draft of ""Better Nate Than Ever."" He calls the day he finished the book ""the best day of my life."" Now critics are raving about ""Nate."" Kids love it, and even adults are approaching Federle. ""Adults are saying to me, 'oh, my gosh, I remember what it was like,' and it's actually inspired a few to say things like, 'I'm going to take up racquetball again,' random stuff that has nothing to do with musicals."" Readers who are fans of TV shows like ""American Idol,"" ""The Voice"" and ""Glee"" might enjoy ""Better Nate Than Ever."" Some may even read it looking for career tips. Federle says desire, talent and hard work are all part of the equation, but what he really wants readers to take away from his book is to dream big, be brave and hold on to hope. ""It's really about putting yourself out there. Every time you leave the stage, you're thinking, 'was that as good as I hoped it was, or was that as bad as I hope it wasn't?' The amazing thing that every artist shares is, in a world where fear is huge, hope is just a little bit bigger.""

"(CNN) -- The Sea of Gallilee, where Christ reputedly walked on water, is today home to another miracle of sorts. It is where hundreds of millions of birds migrate across Israel and a paradise for bird watchers. Located west of the Golan Heights, the area is part of the Great Rift Valley, which stretches from northern Syria to central Mozambique in Africa. It is akin to a superhighway of bird migration routes, creating thermal currents that raptors and other birds can ride from central Africa to Europe. Israel is at a bottleneck on the migratory birds' flight path where an estimated 540 species converge. Compare that with 460 species in Germany, which is 20 times bigger. The Hula Valley, in Galilee, is an important resting and refueling place for migrating birds on their annual journey of thousands of kilometers from Europe and Asia to Africa and back. In late autumn, tens of thousands of common cranes and pelicans flock to the area, as well as more than 25 species of raptors like the imperial eagles and spotted eagles. Some of these birds stay in the area for the entire winter. It is a spectacular sight, and the area has become a popular spot for amateur bird watchers and ornithologists. There is even the Hula Valley Bird Festival held every November. According to Yossi Lessem, director of the International Center for the Study of Bird Migration, every year the Hula Valley's Agamon bird sanctuary attracts 398 bird species, more than 400,000 visitors and 50,000 hardcore bird watchers. Nadav Yisraeli, manager of the Hula Valley Bird Watching Center, has been studying birds here for years. In the middle of the migration season, he will catch hundreds of birds a day, and they will be taken to the ringing station for inspection and measurement. He showed CNN the ringing procedure. ""First, I'm going to record the ring number,"" he said, before moving on to measure the bird's wing length, tail length and weight. ""We are learning that there are certain species that are doing quite well with the changes,"" Yisraeli said, ""and some species are declining, so we can tell something is happening."" One of these change is the war in neighboring Syria. ""If they arrive on a war zone, and that was land on a stop for them and they can't stop and rest, then they are in a problem,"" Yisraeli said. ""They have to move on and sometimes their body will not be fit for that."" Luckily food is abundant in the Hula Valley. In the 1990s, as Israel started to restore its wetlands, more cranes began to stop here and many -- an estimated 30,000 birds -- decided to spend the whole winter in the area. The cranes took a shine to the local peanut crops, costing farmers around $350,000 a year. To avoid conflict between farmers and birds, the Israeli government now provides corn and other bird feed. Tourists can ride along the feeding tractor and the wild birds are hardly disturbed by the gawking visitors. Yenni Kwok contributed to this report.","Located between three continents -- Europe, Asia and Africa, Israel is at a bottleneck on the migratory birds' flight path .

"(CNN) -- I once asked a president of the Central African Republic, Ange-Félix Patassé, to give up a personal monopoly he held on the distribution of refined oil products in his country.   He was unapologetic. ""Do you expect me to lose money in the service of my people?"" he replied. That, in a nutshell, has been the problem of Africa. Very few African governments have been on the same wavelength as Western providers of aid. Aid, by itself, has never developed anything, but where it has been allied to good public policy, sound economic management, and a strong determination to battle poverty, it has made an enormous difference in countries like India, Indonesia, and even China. Those examples illustrate another lesson of aid. Where it works, it represents only a very small share of the total resources devoted to improving roads, schools, heath services, and other things essential for raising incomes. Aid must not overwhelm or displace local efforts; instead, it must settle with being the junior partner. Opinion: Why foreign aid is important for Africa . Because of Africa's needs, and the stubborn nature of its poverty, the continent has attracted far too much aid and far too much interfering by outsiders. From the start, Western governments tried hard to work with public agencies, but fairly soon ran up against the obvious limitations of capacity and seriousness of African states. Early solutions were to pour in ""technical assistance,"" i.e. foreign advisers who stayed on for years, or to try ""enclave"" or turn-key projects that would be independent of government action. More recently, Western agencies have worked with non-government organizations or the private sector. Or, making a virtue of necessity, they have poured large amounts of their assistance directly into government budgets, citing the need for ""simplicity"" and respect for local ""sovereignty."" Through all of this, the development challenge was always on somebody else's shoulders and governments have been eager receivers, rather than clear-headed managers of Western generosity. In the last 20 years, some states -- like Ghana, Uganda, Tanzania, Mozambique, and Mali -- have broken the mould, recognized the importance of taking charge, and tried to use aid more strategically and efficiently. Some commentators would add Benin, Zambia, and Rwanda to that list. But most African governments remain stuck in a culture of dependence or indifference. There are still too many dictators in Africa (six have been in office for more than 25 years) and many elected leaders behave no differently. In Zambia last year, journalist Chansa Kabwela sent photographs of a woman giving birth on the street outside a major hospital (where she had been refused admission) to the president's office, hoping he would look into why this had happened. Instead, the president, Rupiah Banda, ordered the journalist prosecuted for promoting pornography. She was later acquitted. Government callousness is one thing. Discouraging investors is even worse. No aid professional ever suggested that outside help was more important than private effort; on the contrary, foreign aid was intended to help lay the foundations for greater public confidence and private savings and investment. Few economists thought that aid would create wealth, although most hoped that it would help distribute the benefits of growth more evenly. It was plain that institutions, policy, and individual effort were more important than money. So, where -- despite decades of aid -- the conditions for private savings and investment are still forbidding, it is high time we ask ourselves why we are still trying to improve them. The Blair Commission Report on Africa in 2005 reported that 70,000 trained professionals leave Africa every year, and until they -- and the 40 percent of the continent's savings that are held abroad -- start coming home, we need to use aid more restrictively. An obvious solution is to focus aid on the small number of countries that are trying seriously to fight poverty and corruption. Other countries will need to wait -- or settle with only small amounts of aid -- until their politics or policies or attitudes to the private sector are more promising. We should also consider introducing incentives for countries to match outside assistance with greater progress in raising local funds. President Obama is being criticized for increasing U.S. contributions to the international fight against HIV/AIDS by only two percent, with the result that people in Uganda are already being turned away from clinics and condemned to die. When challenged, U.S. officials have had a fairly solid answer. Uganda has recently discovered oil and gas deposits but has gone on a spending spree, reportedly ordering fighter planes worth $300 million from Russia, according to a recent report in the New York Times. Does a government that shows such wanton disregard for common sense or even good taste really have the moral basis for insisting on more help with AIDS? We must not be distracted by recent news of Africa's ""spectacular"" growth and its sudden attractiveness to private investment. Some basic things are changing on the continent, with real effects for the future; above all, Africans are speaking out and refusing to accept tired excuses from their governments. But the truth is that most of Africa's growth -- based on oil and mineral exports -- has not made a whit of difference to the lives of most Africans. Political freedoms shrank on the continent last year, according to the U.S.-based Freedom House index. A quarter of school-age children are still not enrolled, according to World Bank statistics; many of those that are, are receiving a very mediocre education. And agricultural productivity -- the key to reducing poverty -- is essentially stagnant. The really good news is likely to stay local and seep out in small doses, until it eventually overwhelms the inertia and indifference of governments. Five years ago, Kenya managed to double its tax revenues because a former businessman, appointed to head the national revenue agency, took a hatchet to the dishonest practices of many tax collectors. He had every reason to do so. Only five percent of Kenya's budget comes from foreign aid, compared with 40 percent in neighboring countries. This is a good example of the sometimes-perverse effects of aid, but also of the importance of imagination and individual initiative in promoting a better life for Africans. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Calderisi.","Africa has attracted too much aid and interfering by outsiders, says Robert Calderisi .

"(CNN) -- Robin Williams received a warm sendoff from family and friends at a San Francisco tribute Saturday night. The private event at the Curran Theatre was attended by such luminaries as Stevie Wonder, Eric Idle, Bobcat Goldthwait, Bonnie Hunt, Whoopi Goldberg and Billy Crystal. Wonder was among the performers, a rep for Williams confirmed. Idle, the Monty Python legend, took to his Twitter account to talk about the show.

"(CNN) -- Jim Tressel -- who gained fame then infamy as a collegiate football coach in Ohio -- is now poised to lead a new team: Youngstown State University. The school's board of trustees announced Friday that it'll offer the president's job to Tressel, who has worked as an administrator at the University of Akron since departing as head football coach at Ohio State University under a cloud of controversy. ""Mr. Tressel has the personality and leadership skills, in addition to widespread community support, to dramatically raise YSU's profile and prominence across Ohio and the nation,"" board Chairman Sudershan Garg said in a statement. If the job offer is finalized, Tressel will know his way around the school. He obtained legendary status as Youngstown State's head football coach between 1986 and 2000, during which time he led teams to four Division I-AA national championships. This success catapulted Tressel to the top job at Ohio State, which historically boasts one of the top football programs in the country. He quickly picked up where he left off, leading the Buckeyes to the 2002 national championship and seven Big 10 championships. But Tressel's tenure there didn't end well. He left under pressure in 2011 after reports surfaced that several Ohio State players -- including star quarterback Terrelle Pryor -- swapped team and personal memorabilia and equipment for tattoos and other benefits. Those actions alone violate NCAA rules, but it's how Tressel acted -- and didn't act -- that really drew the ire of the NCAA, the nation's dominant intercollegiate sports organization. ""Of great concern to the committee was the fact that (Tressel) became aware of these violations and decided not to report the violations to institutional officials, the Big Ten Conference or the NCAA,"" the NCAA Division 1 Committee on Infractions said in a report issued in December 2011. By then, Tressel had resigned from his Ohio State post (the school later recharacterized his departure as a retirement) and quoted him as saying that he took ""full responsibility for my mistakes."" The whole ordeal led the Buckeyes to vacate all 12 of their wins from the 2010 season and to suspend five players for the first five games of the following campaign. In addition, the NCAA issued a five-year order for Tressel that limited his athletics-related duties and applies to any NCAA school that wants to hire him as a coach. Yet Tressel -- who holds a bachelor's degree in education from Baldwin-Wallace College and a master's degree in education from the University of Akron -- remained active in Ohio and in the field of education. In 2012, he became vice president for strategic engagement at the Akron school and the following year was promoted to executive vice president for student success. The job as president at Youngstown State, which boasts nearly 13,500 students and more than 135 undergraduate and graduate programs, would be another step for Tressel. Michael Slavens, the president of student government at Youngstown State for 2014-2015, says reaction to the Tressel's apparent hiring has been mixed on social media. ""It's been very polarized,"" Slavens said. ""People said they either really wanted Tressel, no matter what, or ... said he was the worst candidate and couldn't believe (university officials) would consider him."" The new president faces a university in flux. Several other top administrative positions, including provost, are open and will need to be filled, Slavens points out. The student government leader said he thinks Tressel, as president, would excel at ""being a cheerleader, the face of the university (because) he knows the area and donors"" and expressed confidence he can craft ""a vision"" for Youngstown State and its future. If and when he is officially hired, Tressel will have lots of attention and, perhaps, momentum to get things done. ""The fact that Tressel is coming back and it's getting people excited, I hope it helps in a meaningful way,"" said Slavens. ""I hope he takes advantage of the hype that he has caused."" Youngstown State has had two presidents over the past two years, not including its current interim leader. Sophomore Jordan Wolfe says that many in the Mahoning Valley are hoping Tressel can steady the ship and perhaps turn all the attention into a positive. But, at the same time, things could quickly turn south -- just like Tressel's time at Ohio State. ""If Tressel can bring stability to YSU and bring in more donations, keeping tuition down, I'm for it,"" Wolfe said. ""Do I think he has the potential to be a bust? Yes.""","NEW: Student leader: Polarized reaction to Youngstown State offer to Tressel .

"(CNN) -- If Adam Silver were commissioner of the NFL, would running back Ray Rice have already been banned from the league? And if Roger Goodell were in charge of the NBA, would Donald Sterling still be the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers? What-ifs and role reversals can make your head spin. What we have are two leagues and two vastly different responses to separate hot-button issues: racism and domestic violence. Silver had little time to settle into his new job. He took over from longtime NBA commissioner David Stern on February 1, and by late April, he was already embroiled in the Sterling controversy. Even with the short break-in period, Silver won rave reviews. He earned them by acting swiftly, sending investigators to Los Angeles to confirm it was Sterling who made racist comments on an audio recording obtained by TMZ. Within days, Silver acted, banning the Clippers owner for life, fining him $2.5 million and initiating proceedings to terminate Sterling's ownership rights. It wasn't easy, but Silver held firm. Sterling went back and forth about selling the team, and made additional reprehensible comments, some in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper. In it, Sterling repeatedly apologized and denied accusations that he's racist, saying he'd been ""baited"" into making what he called ""terrible"" remarks. Still, in the interview, Sterling continued attacks on former NBA great Magic Johnson. In it, he questioned the character of the former Los Angeles Lakers player and his battle with HIV, saying Johnson hasn't done anything to help others. But Johnson shrugged it off, saying he feels sorry for the billionaire and will pray for him. In the end, Silver's actions were seen as decisive and unflinching. Players, team owners and civil rights advocates applauded him. ""There's no room for Donald Sterling in the NBA,"" LeBron James said before a game in April. ""There is no room for him."" ""This attack on Magic is crazy,"" filmmaker Spike Lee told Cooper after the interview. ""He's messing with the wrong brother. Magic is loved by everybody around the world. And the talk about some other stuff that has nothing to do with nothing is ridiculous."" Sterling asked: What has Magic Johnson done? Answer: Quite a lot . There was some criticism, like why did it take the NBA so long to get rid of Sterling when he had been accused of racism several times in the past. In 2009 he settled -- while admitting no liability -- three lawsuits tied to discrimination claims at apartments he owned in Los Angeles County, the Los Angeles Times reported. He also settled a 2003 lawsuit that claimed he wouldn't rent to Latinos, the Times reported. Sterling also was sued in 2009 by former Clippers general manager Elgin Baylor, who said he was a victim of age and racial discrimination. Baylor dropped the race claim and a jury ruled in Sterling's favor. Donald Sterling interview . Bobbling the ball . Now compare that with Goodell's handling of the Ray Rice case. Critics say he fumbled it from the start. It was TMZ again with the damning evidence. Security camera video showed the former Baltimore Raven dragging an unconscious Janay Palmer -- then his fiancee -- out of an elevator. That was back in February, at the beginning of the off-season. The couple married in March. Voices of domestic violence . It would be several months before Goodell interviewed Rice and his wife. And when he did, the two were reportedly in the room together. Another month passed before Goodell gave Rice a two-game suspension, and that didn't sit well with many people. Goodell insisted it was consistent with other cases. Eventually, Goodell admitted that it was a mistake and drew up new domestic violence policy with harsher penalties that were a reaction to the criticism. The harshest blow to Goodell's handling of the case came this week when TMZ released another video that showed Rice throwing the punches that knocked out Palmer. The Baltimore Ravens dropped him from the team, and the NFL suspended him indefinitely. NFL chief Roger Goodell faces intense criticism . Taking the hits . Critics want to know why a tougher punished wasn't handed out sooner. ""I didn't get it right,"" said Goodell. ""Simply put, we have to do better."" The National Organization for Women thinks so. NOW is calling for Goodell's resignation. ""The NFL has lost its way,"" said a statement released late Tuesday by NOW President Terry O'Neill. ""It doesn't have a Ray Rice problem; it has a violence against women problem."" NOW also noted Goodell's silence on the Jerry Jones lawsuit. A former exotic dancer sued the Dallas Cowboys owner this week, accusing him of sexual assault. An attorney for the team called the allegations ""completely false."" Adding to the chorus against Goodell is outspoken ESPN personality Keith Olbermann. He called Goodell an ""enabler of men who beat women"" and demanded the commissioner resign or be fired. San Francisco Chronicle sport columnist Ann Killion agreed. ""Roger Goodell should follow Rice out the door -- his leadership has no integrity and no longer can be trusted by the public. He should resign,"" she wrote. In the reactions to the two cases, perhaps there's a lesson in how the NBA and NFL handled them. Much like on the court or on the field, a decisive hand running the team can blunt much of the criticism.","NFL and NBA commissioners have each faced member conduct challenges in 2014 .

"(CNN) -- Dallas Cowboys tight end Jason Witten is the 2012 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year. Why? In large part because of Witten's tireless commitment to ending domestic violence. As a former professional football player and longtime domestic violence prevention advocate, I understand how gratifying it is to receive this honor from the NFL. For the men engaged in this critical issue, it can be a lonely road. But now Witten has company in Dallas. Moved to action by a series of recent slayings, Mayor Mike Rawlings announced the launch of a citywide awareness campaign to show that domestic violence — and the culture that ignores or perpetuates it — has no home in his city. He's hoping at least 10,000 men show up to rally with that message on Dallas' City Hall Plaza later this month. A drive to end domestic violence, led by men. It's an idea whose time has come, again and again; some men have been pushing it for decades. But now many are hearing the call. Related: Beyond vomiting, how to prevent rape . As Rawlings said in a recent press conference: ""In the past this has been viewed as a women's issue, but it ain't. It's our problem."" The problem is not confined to a shocking spate of killings in Dallas, or to one major U.S. city. The New York Police Department reportedly receives 700 domestic violence calls every day. Domestic violence costs the United States more than $9 billion a year. More than 603 million women live in countries where domestic violence is not a crime. Globally, at least one in three women and girls are beaten or sexually abused in their lifetimes, usually at the hands of men. What can men do? Men do not just need to stop being violent. The vast majority of men are not violent. But men do need to stop being silent. Calling violence against women, whether street harassment or sexual harassment or rape or murder, a ""women's issue"" allows men to ignore it as if we have no responsibility for it or stake in ending it. We all have grandmothers, mothers, sisters, daughters and female friends and colleagues. Our lives are inextricably interwoven; women's issues of safety and equality directly affect our lives as men. Beyond that, women are humans, with the same rights to safety and freedom as men. It is therefore our moral responsibility to not remain silent or passively on the sidelines, but to be actively engaged in confronting this problem in every corner of homes, communities and societies. Many men have already taken action. Men marched with women protesting December's notorious gang rape and murder in Delhi. Men worked with women to stop sexual abuse of women in Egypt's Tahrir Square. Men joined women in pushing for a serious response to allegations of gang rape in Steubenville, Ohio (and the social media vileness that followed). Here in New York, men have produced excellent videos calling on other men to stop street harassment. I've been working since 1994 to bring men in as leaders and partners in stopping violence against women. Today, I believe we stand on the brink of a global tipping point. From Dallas to Delhi, the world is paying attention. Now is the time to stand up. That's why I'm joining Breakthrough, the global human rights group, in its ""One million men. One million promises campaign."" Starting March 8, over one year we will secure promises from men around the world to take concrete action toward stopping violence against women. What can you do? You don't have to be a mayor or an NFL player to have a major impact. You don't have to be like the New York City firefighters who recently tackled the guy attacking his wife with a meat cleaver in broad daylight. Small — even non-""heroic"" — actions add up. Challenge norms. Change culture. Make violence against women unacceptable. You can start with the discrimination and inequality that create the conditions in which violence happens. You can call out a friend who makes a comment that disrespects women. You can treat women well in front of boys and men who look up to you. We all, men and women, can reject the script that gets played out in media every day that tells our boys to be unemotional and violent while objectifying girls at increasingly younger ages. The profound presence of media in our lives has only led to young people being exposed earlier and more often to salacious and sexual content. This media bombardment desensitizes our boys and girls to the reality of violence that is anything but the subtext of a life. Our silence only validates that script. We can speak out against it. You can make sure your workplace's sexual harassment prevention polices are up to date. If you hear things getting violent next door, you can ring the bell or call the doorman or the cops. You can show that giving a damn about equality makes you a better man. You can do this. We can do this. Together, men and women can build a safer world for all. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Don McPherson.","Don McPherson: Not enough men speak out against domestic violence against women .

"London, England (CNN) -- A crowd of students marched through central London on Wednesday, disrupting traffic and shouting slogans in a protest against an increase in university tuition. Students also protested in other cities across Britain, including Leeds, Cambridge and Birmingham. Police said there had been 15 arrests in London and one each in Oxford and Glasgow, Scotland. Three of the arrests happened after students filled Whitehall, the street that runs from Trafalgar Square past the prime minister's residence toward Parliament. Police penned the protesters in at either end to try to limit criminal damage, and a line of police in fluorescent yellow vests kept the students from reaching Parliament Square. ""We're kettled, we're freezing, everyone needs the toilet, but we're having fun,"" protester Clare Solomon told CNN, using a local term for being penned in. Solomon, the president of the University of London student union, said police had been containing them for five hours as of 6 p.m. (1 p.m. ET). ""Obviously, people are starting to get angry now. Everyone is really hungry,"" she said. But she thought the demonstration was a success. She estimated 20,000 to 25,000 people had turned out. Police said they could not give an estimate of the size of the London crowd. ""Students are starting to self-organize,"" Solomon said. ""If we can get 25,000 on the streets with no major organization, it's a sign of things to come."" British universities should not follow the American model, where students have to pay large tuition fees and seek loans or grants themselves if they can't pay, she argued. That excludes poor people from higher education, she said. Students held signs saying ""Stop Education Cuts,"" ""Education not Segregation"" and ""Unite and Fight."" They managed to break into a police van inside the containment area in Whitehall after smashing the windshield, spray-painting the sides and trying to topple it. Other students stood in their way and tried to stop them. Some students set off firecrackers in the crowd. Otherwise, unrest did not appear to reach the level seen during similar protests two weeks ago, when protesters invaded the building holding the headquarters of the Conservative Party. The students are angry about government plans to allow universities to charge as much as 9,000 pounds (about $14,200) a year in tuition fees, a substantial rise from the current cap of 3,000 pounds (about $4,700). The government wants to raise the fees and scrap some subsidies for university students as it tries to cut a massive budget deficit. Defenders of the plan say universities will not necessarily charge the maximum they're allowed to, but education experts have disputed that. In the protests two weeks ago, students spray-painted anarchy symbols, broke windows and set off flares at the Conservative headquarters before being forced out. Some set fires and shot off firecrackers outside the building. That violence marred what was otherwise a largely peaceful protest. The National Union of Students said 50,000 demonstrators were on the streets in that protest. Two officers were injured in the London activities, London's Metropolitan Police said. A female officer broke her hand and a male officer suffered leg injuries, police said. CNN's Richard Allen Greene and Jo Shelley contributed to this report.","NEW: Police pen student demonstrators in for hours, a protester says .

"(CNN) -- For a championship with a distinctly Iberian streak, it is no surprise that South America should be high on MotoGP's list of territories to conquer. This weekend its hordes land in Argentina for the third round of the 2014 season. This vast nation is not entirely unfamiliar with top-class motorcycle racing, but this is still very much the case of an old friend arriving unexpectedly from out of town. The last time Argentinean fans heard the roar of grand prix bikes was in 1999, when current champion Marc Marquez was just six years old. Nevertheless, enthusiasm for the sport in these parts is clear. Spectators will be traveling to the circuit in Santiago del Estero, many by motorcycle, from across the country. Back in March, as Marquez and co. lined up on the grid for the season's opening race in Qatar, 65,000 tickets had already been sold. The grandstands around this redesigned and redeveloped circuit -- crafted by Italian Jarno Zaffelli -- are expected to be full. ""They have done a brilliant job,"" Carmelo Ezpeleta, CEO of MotoGP's commercial rightsholder Dorna, told CNN. ""We felt a very warm welcome since the first time we started negotiating with them."" After a protracted absence the Spaniard believes the time is right for the series to return to South America, with Argentina having met the required standards of motorcycling's ruling body the FIM. ""There is interest in MotoGP in this country, and a circuit and track at the best level possible, with FIM homologation, and with the government of Santiago del Estero completely committed and involved in the project,"" said Ezpeleta. ""Argentina is a country that deserves to have MotoGP."" One thing that should make this weekend's racing particularly intriguing is the fact that the Termas de Rio Hondo circuit is unfamiliar to all of the riders. ""This is a new circuit for everyone and we have to interpret it well,"" said Yamaha's seven-time world champion Valentino Rossi, who was second at the season-opener in Qatar. ""We'll have to understand as soon as possible the ideal setup of the bike, and above all we'll have to understand how the tires behave on this asphalt."" Rossi's teammate Jorge Lorenzo, among the favorites for the title after running Marquez to the wire last year, is anxious to repair the damage wrought by a nightmarish start to his campaign. After crashing on the first lap in Qatar, the Spaniard compounded his misery with an extraordinary false start at the year's second race in Austin, Texas. Lined up on the grid, he had apparently been distracted by mosquitoes on his visor, and sped away before the lights turned green. It was a bizarre and costly error, which was punished with a ride-through penalty, and his 10th-place finish cast him adrift of the championship leaders after just two races. ""It's not easy to swallow what happened at Austin but I always try to get the positive thing even if we are in trouble,"" the 2010 and 2012 world champion said before traveling to Argentina. ""Staying on track is the best way to forget and I think our championship is going to kick off over there."" Lorenzo has spent the last fortnight resting and training in the Mexican resort of Cancun. ""I will arrive with plenty of energy,"" he said. One rider who won't be making the trip is Ducati's Cal Crutchlow, who is recovering from a painful crash at his last outing. After dislocating and breaking a finger the Briton had a pin inserted in the bone and will stay home for treatment. ""I'm very sad to let the team down like this because I was really looking forward to racing,"" he said. ""Unfortunately I'm still feeling too much pain in my right hand."" Across the Ducati garage, however, Andrea Dovizioso is still on a high after a surprise third-place finish in the U.S. ""When you are able to obtain these results, which seem almost impossible, it is truly a great feeling,"" said the Italian, who is relishing the chance to maintain his momentum in Argentina. ""I always like to race on new circuits and so I am very curious and motivated."" Ezpeleta is delighted by the apparent buzz among the riders as they step into the unknown. ""The whole paddock is excited because it's a new track,"" he said. ""Having a new track is motivation, and especially we want to see the feedback of the riders. The ones who were testing here in July were totally happy and satisfied with the circuit. I also want to see the response of the fans."" Honda's two riders, Marquez and Dani Pedrosa, are also feeling pretty satisfied with life.  After finishing just behind his victorious teammate in Austin, Pedrosa has been studiously preparing for this weekend. ""I've tried to do some homework with maps and videos and find our as much as I could before arriving,"" he said, ""but it's hard to say something not being on the bike."" Marquez, whose dominant performances in the opening rounds were all the more remarkable given that he was recovering from a broken leg, is oozing confidence. ""We will be looking to continue the momentum from the first two races,"" the 21-year-old said. Few would bet against him doing so. In spite of Honda and Marquez's apparent iron grip on the lead, Ezpeleta is satisfied with the start of this year's championship, and believes the new Open Class rules have been a success so far. ""The regulations were created to reduce the costs and increase the spectacle, and I think we have accomplished these things,"" he told CNN. ""I'm sure in the future races this season we will have some spectacular battles on track."" As far as the MotoGP circus itself is concerned, Ezpeleta indicated that the series may look to extend its reach into more new territories before too long. ""We would like to expand in South America, as well as Asia,"" he said. ""Brazil is interested in hosting a MotoGP."" The MotoGP chief also hinted that an African grand prix may be a possibility. The last top-class race on the continent was held a decade ago, at South Africa's Phakisa Freeway in 2004. ""I would like to have a grand prix in Africa, as we did in the past,"" added Ezpeleta. ""I can't predict the future, but I would like to have a race there and it's always good to open new frontiers; but right now it's very difficult to predict what's going to happen in Africa."" Fans and administrators alike will also be hoping for some unpredictability this weekend in Argentina; Honda's challengers need to take advantage of this new frontier.","MotoGP will return to Argentina for the fist time since 1999 this weekend .

"(CNN) -- The NFL, already under a spotlight for its handling of domestic violence cases, now has one of its players under investigation for an alleged sexual assault last month. A woman has filed a police report accusing C.J. Spillman of sexual assault, said Sgt. Robert Eberling of the Grapevine Police Department. No arrest has been made and no charges filed in the case. The alleged assault took place on September 20 at the Gaylord Texan Hotel, which is the Cowboys' team hotel, CNN affiliate KDFW reported. ""We are continuing our investigation and have no further details to release at this time,"" Eberling said. CNN reached out to the NFL and the Dallas Cowboys but didn't receive immediate comment from either. Attorney Bruce Ashworth couldn't be immediately reached, and agent Ron Slavin said, ""We're not making a comment at this time."" The alleged assault took place a day after NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced changes to the league's personal conduct policy, including the creation of a committee to review the NFL's personal conduct policy to address the league's handling of domestic violence and sexual assault cases. Goodell said he hoped to have the committee in place by the time the Super Bowl is played February 2, but he did not provide a time line for the committee to make changes to the policy. Word of the alleged attack came just days after attorney Gloria Allred held a news conference saying she had a client who was sexually assaulted by an NFL player. Allred didn't name her client, the player, the team he played for or the city where it was supposed to have taken place. She said the player participated in the team's game the day following the alleged assault. ""Did the NFL allow the player to play yesterday with knowledge of the rape allegation?"" her Monday letter states. ""The NFL Commissioner has been saying that they take allegations of violence against women seriously and they indicate that they are turning over a new leaf, but here, even though a rape allegation should have been reported to them it was not and what are they doing about that?"" The news comes on a week in which Cowboys coach Jason Garrett told players of the team's zero-tolerance policy when it comes to domestic violence, according to local media. If a player is involved in a domestic violence case, they won't play, regardless of due process, The Dallas Morning News reported. ""Part of what our jobs are as coaches is to create the right environment for our players to function both on and off the field,"" Garrett was quoted as saying. Though the NFL and Spillman's team, lawyer and agent aren't commenting, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that a Cowboys source told the newspaper that the team was dealing with Spillman differently because of questions about the veracity of the allegation. The allegations come on the heels of charges levied against NFL players alleging violence: . -- Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice was charged with aggravated assault in March after punching and knocking out his now-wife. He has been suspended indefinitely. -- Last month, Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson was charged with felony child abuse for whipping his son in Texas. He will take a leave with pay until his case is complete, the team said. -- Arizona Cardinals backup running back Jonathan Dwyer was indicted last month on a felony charge of aggravated assault and eight misdemeanors stemming from two July arguments with his wife in which he allegedly head-butted her and fractured her nose. -- Carolina Panthers star defensive end Greg Hardy, who has been granted a new trial this fall after a domestic violence conviction in July, has taken a voluntary leave with pay until his legal matters are resolved, the team announced last month. -- San Francisco 49ers defensive end Ray McDonald was arrested in August on suspicion of felony domestic violence after he allegedly got involved in an altercation with his fiancee, who was 10 weeks pregnant, a police source told The Sacramento Bee. San Francisco 49ers CEO Jed York said the team would await the outcome of the criminal case before determining whether to punish him. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Steve Almasy, Dave Alsup and AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.","Dallas player C.J. Spillman is part of a sexual assault investigation, police say .

"Pyongyang (CNN) -- It is exceedingly rare for Western journalists to be allowed inside the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK) -- commonly known as North Korea. It is even less common for an American reporter to visit this reclusive nation, home to nearly 25 million people who are essentially isolated from the rest of the world. Yet here I am, an American member of a CNN crew, reporting from Pyongyang about the latest high profile sporting event to sweep this city since a bizarre basketball tournament earlier this year. You probably remember when American NBA star Dennis Rodman organized a basketball tournament in Pyongyang. Rodman was widely criticized in the United States for befriending the DPRK's Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un, whose authoritarian regime has been accused by a United Nations panel of widespread human rights abuses, charges that North Korea strongly denies. 'Sports diplomacy' Outside press were not invited to cover Rodman's trip. This time, CNN is among a handful of news organizations granted rare access to Pyongyang to cover the International Pro Wrestling Festival. Retired Japanese wrestling star turned politician Kanji ""Antonio"" Inoki is organizing the event. In his professional heyday, Inoki fought in a memorable and bizarre 1976 match in Tokyo with boxing great Muhammad Ali. Today, as an aging member of the Japanese parliament, he is once again in the headlines for his latest attempt at what he calls ""sports diplomacy"" between Japan and North Korea. Inoki is holding the event in the home country of Rikidozan, his late wrestling mentor. He says it will bring together professional fighters from the United States, China, and several other countries. The wrestlers are also scheduled to tour Pyongyang and interact with North Korean fans. Our journey so far . After landing in Pyongyang, we headed to our hotel,which sits on its own island. Complete with a microbrewery, the hotel tries to give journalists on this trip a Western experience, serving simple Western-style omelettes and potatoes for breakfast. Dinner was a Korean-style meal. Taking a look around the city, we saw some people holding cell phones, which looked like small Blackberrys. People weren't blindly walking about with their eyes locked on the screen; a common sight in Western cities. These were not touch-screen phones, instead gadgets where people can access the internal net and visit certain North Korean sites like government sites and the country's largest newspaper. On Friday morning, we visited the birthplace of North Korean founder, Kim Il Sung. This site is considered sacred -- every North Korean who visits the capital goes there. Bus loads of school children, who took a 23-hour trip from a northern rural province, arrived at the site to take a look. Asked about how they felt about being there, the students recited facts about the place. Even when our minders encouraged them to speak with us, it appeared they were shy or nervous facing foreigners and TV cameras. We headed to the Munsu Water Park, a park with water slides and pools, that current leader, Kim Jong Un, is said to have personally scrutinized 113 times. There weren't many children there, though many North Korean families appeared to be enjoying the activities. The rest of Friday will be spent visiting a new pediatric hospital and a sports village -- all in Pyongyang. During our tightly-controlled five-day trip, we will be under the constant supervision of government minders. We are staying in a hotel on an island -- in the middle of a river -- and we aren't allowed to leave without our government-assigned escorts. We expect them to monitor what we shoot and step-in to stop us if we point our cameras in the wrong direction. We expect to see only what the government will allow us to see -- the landmarks of Pyongyang, omnipresent tributes to the Kim family regime, and majestic displays of patriotic pageantry. Thawing relations . This unusual visit to the Hermit Kingdom comes at a time when years of frosty relations between Tokyo and Pyongyang could be beginning to thaw. In July, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe eased several unilateral sanctions on North Korea after the two countries made progress in talks about Japanese citizens kidnapped by the North Korean regime during the Cold War. The Japanese government says North Korean operatives kidnapped at least 17 Japanese citizens in the late 1970s and early 1980s and possibly dozens more. In 2002, North Korea shocked the international community by admitting to the kidnappings and returning five victims to Japan. But questions still linger about the fate of the remaining 12 confirmed abductees and the other suspected cases. A North Korean ""Special Investigative Committee"" of about 30 government officials is expected to update the Japanese government in the next few weeks on the status of missing Japanese citizens. Families of the abducted hope renewed diplomacy between the two countries will bring long-awaited answers. Among the Japanese sanctions lifted is a restriction asking its citizens not to travel to North Korea, which opens the door for more Japanese tourists to embark on commercial tours of the country. Behind the curtain . Our flight on North Korea's only airline (one of just 10 scheduled flights a week) was packed with mostly Japanese press and an eclectic group of wrestlers who will tour Pyonyang and entertain crowds who rarely see anything like this in their country. At a press conference, one North Korean official said he hopes the event will bring the DPRK closer to Japan after years of tension. Even though decades of isolation and crippling sanctions have left North Korea struggling economically and lagging far behind much of the developed world in terms of technology and infrastructure -- the nation is nearly unrivaled in its ability to mobilize tens of thousands of citizens to put on a spectacular show. It remains yet to be seen if we will get a glimpse behind the curtain to witness the true reality of life in one of the most secretive places on Earth. I asked our government minders if they'd be willing to show us what life is really like for regular people in North Korea. They said they'd ask their superiors and get back to us.","CNN is in Pyongyang for the International Pro Wrestling Festival .

"(CNN) -- If your coach airline seat is uncomfortable, it's your fault. That's the gist of one of hundreds of responses to a CNN.com report about airline seat comfort, configuration and cost. Coach fliers may complain about airline seats, but U.S. airlines are filling those seats pretty successfully. A commenter called withReason7 suggests that consumers are getting what they ask for. ""I will continue to blame the passengers that will sit in any crappy seat as long as it's a little bit cheaper. THAT IS WHY THE AIRLINES ARE DOING THIS. Not because they are mean, because that is what MOST travelers want..."" In the report, a top body measurement expert says Americans are getting bigger, and seat-makers have been basing their designs on the wrong body parts. A seat maker says the industry simply builds what the airlines want. An airline spokesman says passengers are more interested in cost rather than comfort. Have you seen the new numbers for airline passenger traffic? Cha-CHING! From the looks of it, seems like carriers aren't having any trouble selling seats, even if they are less than royal thrones. U.S. airlines hauled 53.1 million passengers in February. That's an increase of 6.1% over traffic in February 2011 and 9% above the same month in 2010, according to the U.S. government. But the numbers also show that airline profits are down a bit, probably due to higher fuel prices, according to the Los Angeles Times. Commenter Rick1948 says airlines have some work to do. ""The domestic airlines need to get back into the customer service business.  Spread the seats out, get rid of the flight attendants with an attitude or have behinds wider than the drink cart, trash the toy airliners and get the real ones back, and start serving real food again.  Then, charge whatever you need to so you can make a REASONABLE profit.  Those who can afford to fly - will - and those who can't - won't.  Then, at least flying won't approximate the pain of a root canal any more."" Are there any new ideas out there that can spread some sunshine among grumpy fliers? Johnkc suggests bringing in Uncle Sam. ""Sometimes, we need the government to save us from ourselves. There should be a mandated minimum width of seats and legroom. Do you really think it is safe with all those people packed in like sardines? We needed the government to mandate auto safety, and should have the same on airlines so that everyone is reasonably comfortable and safe in flying. I am not a fat person, but the way they jam us on airplanes, it is just not fun to fly anymore."" Speaking of the government, Washington is predicting a slight dip in domestic passenger traffic this year, before it starts to rise again in a steep slope that will ultimately see air travel nearly double during the next 20 years. Hopefully, passenger size and weight won't be doubling. America's battle with weight is bleeding over into airline cabins. Commenter razorback10, who wanted to do the right thing, was faced with a difficult choice. ""I flew this last weekend. I am overweight and so looked at the website to see if there was anything I needed to do. It recommended buying two tickets, so I did in the section with extra legroom. Get to my seat and it turns out I don't need the seatbelt extension, I was suprised and informed the stew that I had purchased the 2nd seat so they wouldn't be looking for the person who wasn't showing. The flight is full and there is a waitlist. They actually bring a guy on the plane to ask if I was willing to give my 2nd seat up for him. I politely said no, nodded at him and resumed reading my book. I was terrified of flying because of the bigotry, I sure as hell wasn't going to give up the extra seat I paid for so some guy to take it and then likely complain later."" It's hard to know whether commenter GBGentleman was being serious or facetious when he suggested this: . ""I think they should charge fares based on weight.  You and your luggage get on a scale when you get to the airport.  You get a refund or have to pay more compared to the 'average' price you paid. I weigh significantly less than the 'average' American so why should I supplant the cost of flying those who are larger than I am?  Want to save money LOSE weight.""
