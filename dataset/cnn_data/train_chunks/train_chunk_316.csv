"(CNN) -- A volcano erupted in Papua New Guinea on Friday, spurting ash tens of thousands of feet into the sky. The eruption of Mount Tavurvur on the island of New Britain began early Friday, said Craig Earl-Spurr, a meteorologist at the Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Center in Australia. The volcano spewed a thick tower of ash that reached as high as 60,000 feet above sea level. Dramatic photos posted on social media showed Tavurvur belching fire and ash from across a bay. The volcano is situated only a few kilometers from the township of Rabaul. In 1994, Tavurvur erupted at the same time as nearby Mount Vulcan, destroying Rabaul.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- A potent stash of Russian-made surface-to-air missiles is missing from a huge Tripoli weapons warehouse amid reports of weapons looting across war-torn Libya. They are Grinch SA-24 shoulder-launched missiles, also known as Igla-S missiles, the equivalent of U.S.-made Stinger missiles. A CNN team and Human Rights Watch found dozens of empty crates marked with packing lists and inventory numbers that identified the items as Igla-S surface-to-air missiles. The list for one box, for example, written in English and Russian, said it had contained two missiles, with inventory number ""Missile 9M342,"" and a power source, inventory number ""Article 9B238."" Grinch SA-24s are designed to target front-line aircraft, helicopters, cruise missiles and drones. They can shoot down a plane flying as high as 11,000 feet and can travel 19,000 feet straight out. Fighters aligned with the National Transitional Council and others swiped armaments from the storage facility, witnesses told Human Rights Watch. The warehouse is located near a base of the Khamis Brigade, a special forces unit in Gadhafi's military, in the southeastern part of the capital. The warehouse contains mortars and artillery rounds, but there are empty crates for those items as well. There are also empty boxes for another surface-to-air missile, the SA-7. Peter Bouckaert, Human Rights Watch emergencies director, told CNN he has seen the same pattern in armories looted elsewhere in Libya, noting that ""in every city we arrive, the first thing to disappear are the surface-to-air missiles."" He said such missiles can fetch many thousands of dollars on the black market. ""We are talking about some 20,000 surface-to-air missiles in all of Libya, and I've seen cars packed with them."" he said. ""They could turn all of North Africa into a no-fly zone."" There was no immediate comment from NTC officials. The lack of security at the weapons site raises concerns about stability in post-Gadhafi Libya and whether the new NTC leadership is doing enough to stop the weapons from getting into the wrong hands. A NATO official, who asked to not be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said 575 surface-to-air missiles, radar systems and sites or storage facilities were hit by NATO airstrikes and either damaged or destroyed between March 31 and Saturday. He didn't elaborate on the specifics about the targets. Gen. Carter Ham, chief of U.S. Africa Command, has said he's concerned about the proliferation of weapons, most notably the shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles. He said there were about 20,000 in Libya when the international operation began earlier this year and many of them have not been accounted for. ""That's going to be a concern for some period of time,"" he said in April. Gilles de Kerchove, the European Union counterterrorism coordinator, raised concerns Monday about the possibility that al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, based in North Africa, could gain access to small arms, machine guns and surface-to-air missiles. Western officials worry that weapons from the storage sites will end up in the hands of militants or adversaries like Iran. The governments of neighboring Niger and Chad have both said that weapons from Libya are already being smuggled into their countries, and they are destined for al Qaeda. They include detonators and a plastic explosive called Semtex. Chad's president said they include SA-7 missiles. An ethnic Tuareg leader in the northern Niger city of Agadez also said many weapons have come across the border. He said he and other Tuareg leaders are anxious about Gadhafi's Tuareg fighters returning home -- with their weapons -- and making common cause with al Qaeda cells in the region. Gadhafi's fighting forces have included mercenaries from other African nations. The missing weapons also conjure fears of what happened in Iraq, where people grabbed scores of weapons when Saddam Hussein's regime was overthrown. Bouckaert said one or two of the missing artillery rounds are ""enough to make a car bomb."" ""We should remember what happened in Iraq,"" he said, when the ""country was turned upside down"" by insurgents using such weaponry. There have been similar concerns in Afghanistan, where the United States provided thousands of Stinger missiles to the Afghan mujahedeen when they were fighting the Soviets in the 1980s. The United States has spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to buy them back, fearful that they would fall into the hands of terrorists.

"(CNN) -- It's that time of year when colleges around the country show off the people who will offer the last lesson to soon-to-be graduates: the commencement speakers. This year, some universities drew on famous alumni: The University of New Hampshire featured 1992 New Hampshire graduate Jennifer Lee, the Oscar-winning screenwriter and director of Disney's hit film ""Frozen."" Shonda Rhimes, creator of ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Scandal,"" told graduates of her alma mater, Dartmouth College, that it's impossible to do it all, but it's still worth doing as much as they can. ""Volunteer some hours. Focus on something outside yourself. Devote a slice of your energies towards making the world suck less every week,"" Rhimes said. ""Some people suggest doing this will increase your sense of well-being. Some say it's good karma. I say that it will allow you to remember that, whether you are a legacy or the first in your family to go to college, the air you are breathing right now is rare air. Appreciate it."" Other schools competed for high-profile speakers like President Barack Obama, who spoke at University of California-Irvine in June after receiving 10,000 postcards from the community asking him to attend. First lady Michelle Obama spoke at Dillard University in New Orleans, as well as a high school senior recognition ceremony in Topeka, Kansas, and a college access program in Washington. President Obama used part of his speech at University of California-Irvine to address climate change, calling lawmakers and pundits who deny manmade climate change a ""fairly serious threat to everybody's future."" ""Progress won't always be flashy. It will be measured in disasters averted, and lives saved, and a planet preserved -- and days just like this one, 20 years from now, and 50 years from now, and 100 years from now,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- A number of Chipotle employees across Minnesota were fired after an immigration audit targeted the restaurant chain for allegedly hiring undocumented workers, officials said. ""We are not disclosing a number of people displaced by this,"" company spokesman Chris Arnold said Monday. ""We did lose some restaurant employees in Minnesota following a document review by Immigration and Customs Enforcement."" The review took place last month and is likely reflective of a shift away from work-site crackdowns against employees -- considered a hallmark practice under the Bush administration -- and toward so-called ""I-9 audits,"" which instead focus on the hiring practices of their employers, according to analysts and a U.S. Immigration official who declined to be named. The I-9 form is an employment eligibility document meant to determine a person's ability to work legally in the United States. ""At the end of the day, the goal is to ensure that the companies have an authorized, legal workforce and also that employers are aware of their responsibility to ensure the people they hire are lawful,"" the official said. The I-9 strategy is believed to be a more effective use of the agency's investigative resources, putting the onus on the audited company to take corrective action, the official added. Chipotle has ""done what ICE has asked of us and are looking to put that incident behind us,"" Arnold said. The crackdown coincides with recent judiciary hearings in Arizona in which lawmakers debated proposals to end birthright citizenship for U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants. Nearly one-third of America's 38 million immigrants are illegal, just under four percent of the total U.S. population, according to recent reports from the Pew Hispanic Research Center and the Brookings Institute, a Washington-based think tank. Of those, many are employed in low-wage restaurants jobs. But analysts debate the broader economic impact of illegal immigration in the United States. Critics often blame the large undocumented workforce for siphoning public resources while forcing a drop in wages or displacing low-skilled U.S.-born workers. Advocates say consumers benefit from lower prices as a result of the lower wages paid to illegal workers, arguing that they fill unskilled labor gaps and create work opportunities for higher-skilled, higher-paid workers who are often native born. Illegal immigration ""nationally, doesn't seem to make a significant difference"" to the broader U.S. economy, said Audrey Singer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute who studies U.S. immigration policy. ""The real impact is at local levels,"" Singer said, pointing to state and local law enforcement, schools and health care systems that pay for an undocumented workforce that may or may not contribute tax revenue for services rendered. But as record unemployment rates affect cities and towns across the country, immigrants -- particularly illegal immigrants -- are being targeted, she said.

"(CNN) -- A wildfire in a northeast Minnesota woodland grew by nearly tenfold Tuesday, giving off a pall of smoke that stretched from the Canadian border to southern Wisconsin. Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton called in National Guard helicopters to assist firefighters as the Pagami Creek fire, located in the remote Superior National Forest. It spread from about 11,000 acres on Monday to more than 100,000 by Tuesday afternoon, said Doug Anderson, a spokesman for the firefighting effort. The blaze started in mid-August after a lightning strike, but jumped about 16 miles eastward on Monday -- ""unprecedented for northern Minnesota,"" said Lisa Radosevich-Craig, another spokeswoman for the fire command. No injuries were reported and no buildings had been destroyed, but 36 homes in the nearby community of Isabella were evacuated as a precaution, she said. About 25 National Guard troops and four Black Hawk helicopters activated by Tuesday evening, the state Guard reported. Air National Guard members were also activated to assist the effort. The fire was centered about 80 miles north of Duluth and about 240 miles north of Minneapolis -- but the smoke stretched across the upper Great Lakes for hundreds of miles. Tyler Barnes, a spokesman for baseball's Milwaukee Brewers, said that haze contributed to the team's decision to close the retractable roof at its stadium for Tuesday night's game against the Colorado Rockies. ""The forecast tonight was for lower temperatures that would have put us right around the line for closing the roof for fan comfort,"" Barnes told CNN. ""The haze and smoke made the decision that much easier."" Milwaukee is about 500 miles from the blaze. Radosevich-Craig said the fire was spread by near-drought conditions in the region that had already prompted the Forest Service to close some parts of the reserve and restrict campfires in others. The last major fire in the area, about five years ago, scorched about 35,000 acres, she said.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recently announced that it is no longer recommending prostate cancer screening for men. A spokesman for the Prostate Cancer Foundation told CNN the recommendation is ""a tremendous mistake,"" but the senior author of the task force's report says the prostate specific antigen, or PSA, test does more harm than good. The report says that cancers detected by the test are often slow-growing and would never be harmful, but that treatment could render a man impotent or incontinent or kill him. It's a debate that's ongoing for several other types of screening as well, but not all are in contention. Here's what you should know about the four most common types of pre-symptom cancer screenings, including the leading experts' recommendations and what the test involves: . Prostate cancer . Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer among men, with approximately 30,000 dying from the disease each year. The American Cancer Society recommends that men over 50 with no special risk factors talk to their doctors and decide on an individual basis -- after weighing the risks of treatment -- if they want to be screened. The American Urological Association says that making an informed decision about screening is important, but that all men with a life expectancy of 10 years or more should have a baseline PSA test at the age of 40. Prostate cancer screenings include a blood test for elevated levels of the prostate specific antigen protein and a digital rectal examination. During the digital rectal exam, a doctor will insert a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for abnormalities in the prostate. Breast cancer . The chance of developing invasive breast cancer for American women is a little less than one in eight, according to the American Cancer Society. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force released a statement two years ago recommending against yearly mammograms for breast cancer for women in their 40s. The task force said the benefits didn't significantly outweigh the risks. However, the ACS and the Susan G. Komen for the Cure foundation have fought against this recommendation. Mammograms have helped reduce breast cancer mortality rates in the U.S. by nearly one-third since 1990, according to the American College of Radiology. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the National Cancer Institute recommend that women age 40 and older get screened for breast cancer every one to two years. A mammogram is basically an X-ray of the breast. Plates flatten the breast tissue to take a more accurate photo, often from two angles, which can be uncomfortable but only takes a moment. The photos are then analyzed for calcifications, which appear as white dots, and any mass that looks abnormal such as a cyst or tumor. Colorectal cancer . Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death, but also one of the most curable if caught early. The tests that the National Cancer Institute recommends for both men and women over the age of 50 to screen for colorectal cancer and polyps include a flexible sigmoidoscopy, a colonoscopy, a double-contrast barium enema and a virtual colonoscopy. However the ACS says only the colonoscopy can see the complete colon and is best for screening. The U.S. Preventive Service Task Force agrees, giving colorectal screenings an ""A"" grade. During a colonoscopy, a thin tube is inserted through the rectum and into the colon. The tube has a light and camera-like apparatus for viewing any polyps or unusual pieces of tissue. Complications from colonoscopy are rare, but can include tears in the lining of the colon. Cervical cancer . The number of cases of cervical cancer has decreased significantly in the United States over the past 40 years thanks to regular screenings, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2007, 4,021 women died from the disease. ACS recommends yearly Pap tests for all women beginning at age 21, or three years after they begin having intercourse. At age 30 women may choose to reduce screenings to once every two or three years until they are 70 years old. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force agrees. Do not confuse a Pap test with a pelvic exam, the ACS warns. A Pap test will include a gentle scraping of your cervix with a spatula-looking instrument; the cells collected will be sent to a lab for analysis. This is usually done at the start of a pelvic exam, after the doctor has inserted a speculum into the vagina.","Prostate cancer screenings include a blood test and a digital rectal examination .

"New York (CNN) -- A New York teacher's aide previously accused of distributing child pornography has been arrested again, this time on a charge of making such pornography, possibly on school grounds. Taleek Brooks, 40, had been employed at Weeksville Elementary School in Brooklyn since 1995 and volunteered at an after-school program there with the Madison Square Boys and Girls Club. The Department of Education had suspended him without pay after learning of the initial arrest on January 13, when the FBI charged him with distributing child pornography. He was rearrested Tuesday and is being held without bail. According to the complaint, the FBI found photos and videos showing Brooks spanking a naked boy inside a classroom and touching another boy. Last month, FBI agents searched Brooks' home and discovered more than a thousand lewd photographs and videos, authorities said. They said Brooks told them he had been collecting the material for at least seven years. At the time, they said, Brooks admitted that he viewed and traded child pornography on daily basis. During the search, FBI agents seized a computer and two hard drives containing the material, authorities said. Brooks was scheduled to appear in court on the initial charge until investigators found evidence that some of the material was made by Brooks, they said. Dennis M. Walcott, chancellor of New York City schools, met with Weeksville's principal and staff after the news of the second arrest. ""As a chancellor, and as a father, I am horrified and disgusted at the charges we learned today from the FBI,"" Walcott said in a written statement. ""Our paramount concern is for the safety of our students, and we are cooperating fully with the federal authorities as they continue their investigation."" The school sent a letter home with the children Tuesday, informing parents that a crisis team would be at the school Wednesday and an FBI hotline had been set up for people who want to offer information. The FBI was at the school on Wednesday trying to identify the victims and determine if the videos were shot inside the school. Jim Margolin, a spokesman for FBI, said children were not being interviewed at that time.","A Brooklyn elementary school teacher's aide is being held without bail .

"(CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI's spokesman has denied the pontiff will resign over the arrest of his butler on suspicion of leaking confidential documents, the Vatican press office said Thursday. During a Wednesday meeting with journalists to answer questions about the situation, the Rev. Frederico Lombardi said the ""hypothesis"" advanced by some media outlets that the pope would resign are ""baseless creations of some journalists, which have no foundation in reality."" Butler Paolo Gabriele, 46, was arrested last week and accused of illegal possession of confidential documents. Lombardi said Wednesday that Gabriele has met with his attorneys, ""who will probably request monitored surveillance or house arrest for their client."" Gabriele, one of only a handful of people with access to the pontiff's private desk, has been charged with aggravated theft for allegedly stealing private documents, Lombardi said earlier. He is suspected of leaking the papers to an Italian journalist. The Vatican has said confidential documents were found in Gabriele's apartment in Vatican territory. But Lombardi said Wednesday that media reports that said packets of documents, prepared for sending to specific people, were found in Gabriele's home were unfounded. Material found in Gabriele's possession is being studied and catalogued, he said. ""It seems to me,"" Lombardi said, ""that there is a line of desire for truth and clarity, a desire for transparency that, although it will take time, continues forward. I thus honestly believe that we are trying to handle this new situation: We are seeking the truth and trying to objectively understand what may have happened."" The investigation, he said, is still in its preliminary stages. Last month, the Vatican gave Cardinal Julian Herranz a ""pontifical mandate"" to uncover the source of hundreds of personal letters and confidential documents given to Gianluigi Nuzzi, an Italian journalist and author of ""Sua Santita,"" a book that translates to ""His Holiness"" and includes the documents. Nuzzi would not divulge his sources but previously told CNN that his primary source -- whom he referred to as ""Maria"" in his book -- ""risked life and limb"" if ever discovered. He said the source worked inside the Vatican but would not reveal details, including the source's gender, age and whether or not they were clergy. He said this week that he had not been questioned in connection with Gabriele's arrest. The Vatican called publication of Nuzzi's book ""criminal"" when it was released in Italian this month. A top Roman Catholic Church official, Archbishop Angelo Becciu, told the Vatican's official newspaper Wednesday the theft of the documents was ""an immoral act of unprecedented gravity"" and a ""despicable abuse of the relationship of trust that exists between Benedict XVI and those who turn to him."" With the leaks, he said, the pope's very ministry ""has come under attack."" But observers say the scandal lifts the lid on a secret power struggle going on behind the closed doors of the Catholic Church. The alleged documents leak, along with the firing of the head of the Vatican Bank, are aimed at weakening the authority of the pope's second-in-command, they say. Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican's secretary of state, is involved in a power struggle with his predecessor, the observers said. ""The reason for this fight is that the secretary of state will have a strong influence over the next conclave which will choose the next pope,"" said Giacomo Galeazzi, a journalist at the Italian daily La Stampa. Cardinal Angelo Sodano, secretary of state to the late John Paul II, is trying to sideline Bertone and put one of his own proteges in place before Benedict dies, he said. ""The leaks will end when Bertone is out as secretary of state,"" Galeazzi said. When he became Vatican secretary of state, Bertone ""did what normally happens,"" said the Rev. Thomas Reese, author of ""Inside the Vatican."" ""He brought in his team, the people he likes, the people he trusts, and put them in key positions in the Vatican."" ""There are people who had hitched their star to the previous secretary of state, who thought by now they would become an archbishop or a cardinal, and they didn't,"" Reese said. ""These people are unhappy and don't like Bertone."" CNN's Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report.","Vatican says reports that the pope will step down ""have no foundation in reality""

"Pumwani, Kenya (CNN) -- Asha Mohamed sits in her cramped room in Pumwani slum clutching a tiny photo of her son, Harun. He's dressed in a blue-striped tie framed by a crisp white T-shirt -- a typical 15-year-old Kenyan high school student. But in September he vanished. ""Harun woke up very early and asked his sister ""what time is it?"" says Asha. He kept on asking her again and again. Then, at four in the morning, he left the house."" In her heart, Asha knew where he had gone, but the text messages later confirmed it. Harun left his school and home in Kenya to fight for al Qaeda-linked Al Shabaab. ""It started when he was 14. He came to me many times and said ""mom, I am going to Somalia to fight Jihad."" I thought he was just playing."" For years, Al Shabaab has targeted Somalis abroad to fight in their campaign to overthrown the weak transitional government. Now Kenyans, with no ethnic link to Somalia, are joining the Jihad. According to a recent U.N. report, there are ""extensive Kenyan networks linked to Al-Shabaab, which not only recruit and raise funds for the organization, but also conduct orientation and training events."" Many of those events centered on Pumwani, a largely Muslim slum in Nairobi. Here, residents and religious leaders speak of a charismatic young Kenyan Sheikh that arrived from Mombasa. They say he bravely stood up to corruption, promoted the Quran, and generously handed out scholarships to young men. And he stoked their passion for Al Shabaab. The man is Sheikh Ahmad Iman Ali -- now the leader of Al Shabaab's Kenya cell. He is remembered fondly at the Maratib Islamic Center in Pumwani. ""He was fearless and, at the same time, kind,"" says Abdullah Kilume, the administrator of the center. ""The majority think he was a good man, he did a lot of good, they saw what he did."" Sheikh Iman would conduct lengthy sermons at the center's mosque, says the U.N. report. The sermons were called 'Jihad Training sessions' and many of them are posted on the internet. According to the U.N's investigations, training sessions included classroom based lectures about 'Islamic Struggles' in Afghanistan, Iraq and Yemen. Many of the children wore ""Jihad is our Religion"" T-shirts. Kilume remembers Sheikh Iman's teachings well. He said that he appealed to the Kenyan youth of Pumwani. ""It reached the youth. I personally know that some of them wanted to go to Somalia."" But while parents in this area supported the Sheikh's war on graft and welcomed his financial help in this grindingly poor place, they felt differently when their children started to vanish. ""I went to that mosque and caused havoc, but they didn't care,"" says Asha. ""Somalia, that is not his war, I don't even know why they are fighting, so why should he leave here and go fight in something he doesn't even understand."" But increasingly, it seems, these Kenyan youth do see it as their fight too. Six of Harun's school friends who attended the center also vanished, she says. Local authorities wouldn't comment specifically on the case, but they acknowledged that a problem exists. The youth, who fled face the prospect of fighting Kenyan soldiers, many of them Muslim, who are engaged in an incursion deep into Somalia to stamp out Al Shabaab. Kilumi, the Muslim Center administrator, says he can accept it if these Kenyan recruits to Al Shaabab end up killing Kenyan soldiers. ""Like every other Muslim, I would like the Sharia law to be implemented and that is what they want to do in that part of Somalia,"" he says. ""Muslims first, Kenyans second."" Sheikh Iman's recruiting and fundraising drive has apparently been so successful that he has been rapidly promoted through the ranks of Al Shabaab. In 2009 he moved his base to Somalia, where it's believed that he commands a force of between 300 and 500 Kenyan fighters. In January a video of the sheikh was posted on jihadi websites. It's not known when the video was recorded. It shows him seated cross-legged in battle fatigues. Sheikh Iman called again for Kenya's youth to cross over the border to fight. And if they couldnÂ¹t, he gave them a simple message. ""Raise your sword against the enemy that is closest to you. Jihad should now be waged inside Kenya.""","Mom tells how her teen son living in a Kenyan slum was one of at least six persuaded to join al-Qaeda-linked Al Shabaab .

"(CNN) -- Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers Hall of Fame center fielder Donald ""Duke"" Snider died Sunday at a convalescent hospital in Escondido, California. He was 84, according to team officials. Snider's career with the Dodgers spanned 16 seasons and included a half-dozen World Series appearances. Among them was the 1955 series, which the Brooklyn Dodgers won, as well as the 1959 series title, which Snider's team captured after moving to California. A statement released by the Dodgers' organization described Snider as one of ""the game's more feared hitters."" Snider led the major leagues in home runs and runs batted in during the 1950s. With a career total 389 home runs and 1,271 RBIs, the seven-time All-Star center fielder remains the Dodger franchise's all-time leader in both categories. He slugged four homers apiece in the 1952 and 1955 World Series. Snider was nicknamed ""Duke"" by his father at age 5. The former high school baseball, football and basketball standout was inducted in to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1980 and his Dodger number 4 uniform was retired. After retiring as a player, Snider returned as a minor league manager for the Dodgers. He later joined the Montreal Expos as batting coach and broadcaster. ""He was an extremely gifted talent and his defensive abilities were often overlooked because of playing in a small ballpark, Ebbets Field,"" said former Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully, referring to the Dodgers' home in Brooklyn. ""When he had a chance to run and move defensively, he had the grace and the abilities of (Joe) DiMaggio and (Willie) Mays and of course, he was a World Series hero that will forever be remembered in the borough of Brooklyn.""

"(CNN) -- He was sentenced to life in prison plus 1,000 years for a heinous crime, but in the end he cut that life short. Ariel Castro, convicted of kidnapping and raping three women, as well as murder, committed suicide in his prison cell Tuesday night, the Franklin County, Ohio, coroner's office said. The discovery of the three women who had been Castro's captives in his Cleveland home for about a decade was shocking from the outset, and surprising in its end. Castro, 52, hanged himself with a bedsheet, Coroner Dr. Jan Gorniak told CNN on Wednesday. He was being held at the Correctional Reception Center in Orient. Prison medical staff tried to revive him but failed. Castro was taken to The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 10:52 p.m. The Cuyahoga County prosecutor had tough words in the wake of Castro's suicide. ""These degenerate molesters are cowards,"" Timothy J. McGinty said. ""... This man couldn't take, for even a month, a small portion of what he had dished out for more than a decade."" Castro's brother-in-law, Juan Alicea, told CNN that the family was notified by the warden about 1 a.m. The family is angry, he said, that it first learned about the death from media reports. Alicea said that Castro's mother and sister visited him twice in prison, most recently on August 26. During that last visit, both women said they were worried by his demeanor, mood and body language; he appeared depressed, Alicea said. But nothing indicated that Castro was contemplating suicide, Alicea said, recounting what the women told him. In fact, he said, the final letter that Castro's mother received from the inmate was more upbeat. Another family member, Maria Castro-Montes, said she cried when she heard the news. Her first thoughts were with the three victims -- Michelle Knight, Georgina DeJesus and Amanda Berry -- and what they must be feeling. Would they be glad or angry about Castro's death? The three women held captive by Castro are aware of his suicide, Knight's attorney, Kathryn Joseph, told CNN. She said the women will not be making a statement. Castro-Montes said nearly everyone in the family had cut ties with Castro, and relatives hope that with his death, the tragic story can come to an end. ""It was just shock and part of it was even relief in hopes that now this will just end all of it and that his name will not be out in the spotlight for years and years to come,"" she told CNN. ""I just hope the victims can move past this now."" 'No one should be celebrating' Castro was not a part of the general prison population, officials said. ""He was housed in protective custody which means he was in a cell by himself and rounds are required every 30 minutes at staggered intervals,"" JoEllen Smith of the corrections department told CNN in a written statement. ""A thorough review of this incident is under way,"" she added. At least two investigations will be done, according to another corrections department statement. The prison director commissioned a review team, to be made up of legal, medical, mental health, security and operational professionals not directly involved in the incident, to analyze Castro's death. The Ohio State Highway Patrol will conduct a separate, independent investigation. 'Hope for everyone,' ex-captive says before house demolished . But Castro attorney Craig Weintraub said more precautions against a possible suicide should have been taken. Castro's attorneys had requested permission for an independent forensic psychologist to evaluate their client, but were denied by officials, he said. If Castro was believed to be suicidal, he should have been under stricter protection, he said. Some will see his death as ""a happy ending to this story, and a quick ending and justifiable,"" Weintraub said. ""But we're in a civilized society and no one should really be celebrating this."" No place in the world . In handing down a sentence last month, Judge Michael Russo told the kidnapper there was no place in the world for his brand of criminal. Castro pleaded guilty to 937 counts, including murder and kidnapping, in exchange for the death penalty being taken off the table. The charges stem from his kidnapping, rape and assault of Knight, abducted in 2002; DeJesus, abducted in 2004; and Berry; abducted in 2003. Castro is the father of Berry's 6-year-old daughter, DNA tests confirmed. Castro's victims resilient after years of abuse . 'You will die a little every day' All three women kept diaries with Castro's permission, providing many of the details of their abuse. ""I cried every night. I was so alone. I worried what would happen to me and the other girls every day,"" Knight, 32, said, as she addressed her abductor head-on during his sentencing. ""I will live on. You will die a little every day."" In each case, Castro lured the women into his car with the promise of a ride, according to court documents. The women and girl were freed in May after Berry shouted for help while Castro was away. Neighbors heard her cries and came to her aid as she tried to break through a door. One neighbor gave her a cell phone to call authorities. ""Help me, I am Amanda Berry,"" she frantically told a 911 operator. ""I've been kidnapped, and I've been missing for 10 years. And I'm here, I'm free now."" Captives' hellish life inside Castro's home . Plays the victim, blames the victims . During his sentencing, Castro played the victim, saying he was addicted to porn and masturbation. In his oft-disjointed statement, he referred to himself as ""very emotional"" and ""a happy person inside."" Castro appeared to blame the victims and accused them of lying about their treatment. He went on to say that none of the women was a virgin when he abducted them, that they wanted sex and there was ""harmony"" in the ""happy household."" Castro's 1,400-square-foot home was reconfigured to keep their whereabouts a secret, FBI agent Andrew Burke testified. The back door was outfitted with an alarm, bedspreads and curtains obscured parts of the home and a porch swing was placed in front of the stairs leading to the rooms where Castro held the women and girl hostage. Police also testified Castro would chain the women to objects, including a support pole in his basement. In the room where Berry and her daughter were held, the doorknob was removed, a lock was affixed to the outside and a hole was cut through the door for ventilation because the windows had been boarded up from the inside, Burke said. Burke also described a handwritten letter in which Castro claimed he had been sexually abused as a child and wrote, ""I am a sexual predator."" Most dramatic moments from his sentencing . 'You saved us' The first police officer on the scene, Barbara Johnson, recalled for the court how she and another officer heard the pitter-patter of footsteps in a dark room where Knight and DeJesus were held. When the captive women realized they were police, Knight ""literally launched herself"" onto an officer, ""legs, arms, just choking him. She just kept repeating, 'You saved us! You saved us!' "" Johnson said. The women were described as scared, pale, malnourished and dehydrated when they were rescued. Dr. Gerald Maloney, who was in the emergency room when the victims arrived, said Knight requested that no male physicians attend to her. Castro's son said he wouldn't visit dad in prison .

"(Lonely Planet) -- What's the first thing you think of when you think of Hawaii? The foaming-white sea lapping at a golden-sand beach surrounded by palm trees swaying in the breeze? Well, sure -- Hawaii's one of the world's ultimate beach destinations, an island paradise made for basking in the sun sipping daiquiris or hitting the waves to surf some righteous tubes. But what to do if you're one of those people who just can't stand beaches? (Scorching sunburn, salt in your hair and sand everywhere!) If you're a beach hater, don't dismiss Hawaii just yet: there's plenty to do on the Hawaiian islands where you'll never have to step foot on sand. Here are some of our suggestions. HAWAI'I (the Big Island) Mauna Kea . This dormant volcano's peak is 4205 m (13,796 ft) above sea level -- the highest mountain in the state of Hawaii. (If you measure from its base underneath the Pacific, though, it's 10,000 m (33,000 ft) tall -- making it the tallest mountain on Earth.) With such a clear vantage point, it's no wonder that its snowy summit is dotted with the greatest collection of astronomical telescopes in the world. The Onizuka Center here offers astronomy displays and nightly stargazing programs to the public. Experienced mountaineers can even hike 12 miles to the summit through an otherworldly landscape of volcanic cinder cones and ancient archaeological sites. Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park . If you'd prefer to see some live volcano action, head southeast to this unique national park, where Kilauea, the world's most active volcano, has been erupting continuously since 1983. Outside the park boundaries, depending on conditions the day you visit, you may even be able to see fresh molten lava flowing into the sea (which is slowly but surely making the Big Island even bigger, year after year). But even if the volcano goddess Pele isn't cooperating, there are still plenty of intriguing sights within the park's confines: hollowed-out lava tubes, steaming craters, tropical rainforest and old lava trails. Rangers offer guided walks and other activities at the visitor center. For information on volcanic activity, the National Park Service has helpful updates (plus lava cam). MAUI . Upcountry Maui and Haleakala National Park . The volcanic soil and sloped pastures of Mt Haleakala have sustained much of Maui's farming and livestock for the past two centuries, and the paniolo (cowboy) vibe is still strong in towns like rustic Makawao. A drive through the plush pastures of the Kula region will take you past cattle ranches, vineyards with cellar-door sales, goat dairies and a huge lavender farm (with a cafe and gift shop offering lavender versions of just about any foodstuff or cosmetic product you can imagine -- and even those you can't). If you keep driving you can follow a tortuously winding road up the flank of Mt Haleakala itself, up 3055 m (10,023 ft) to the summit, where you can explore the surreal, lunar-like landscape -- home to unique flora such as the ten-year-blooming Haleakala silversword, which grows nowhere else on Earth -- and stare down at clouds filling enormous volcanic craters below you. If you can get up early (or stay up late) enough, book a tour to catch the sublime sight of sunrise from the peak; you can also have a van take you and a bicycle up to the top so you can ride -- er, roll all the way down. Lahaina . This colorful town was once the whaling capital of the Pacific, where ships would dock for supplies, sailors and shore leave. Today the dance halls, saloons and brothels that kept the whalers busy have been replaced by the best restaurants on Maui, art galleries that host free ""art nights"" every Friday, bars with live music from Irish trad to jazz and, of course, souvenir shops (c'mon, it is Hawaii). Meanwhile, Lahaina's seafaring past is kept alive by the numerous whale-watching cruises that depart from its harbor. O'AHU . Diamond Head . This extinct volcanic tuff cone stands guard over Waikiki, and is O'ahu's signature backdrop. You can hike to the top in about an hour or less -- a paved trail leads 1.3 km (0.8 miles) all the way to the summit, which at 232 m (760 ft) affords some pretty awesome views of Waikiki. (OK, you'll still have to see a beach, but you won't have to step on it. Happy?) USS Arizona Memorial . The tragic events of December 7,1941 are memorialized at Pearl Harbor, just a short drive from downtown Honolulu. The USS Arizona lies where it sank, the resting place of over a thousand of the U.S. sailors who died in the Japanese attack. In 1962 the memorial was opened, with a structure built over the ship that allows you to view its remains poking out of the shallow water below; a marble wall inside is engraved with the names of the honored dead. A visit to Pearl Harbor will leave you with a palpable sense of the history that was made there. KAUA'I . Waimea Canyon . This gigantic chasm at the heart of Kaua'i is one of the island's greatest natural wonders, and its red-and-black-striated lava-rock walls contrasted with the lush green forests that blanket its top is a true sight to behold. Its name comes from the Waimea River, which runs through the bottom; the canyon was formed by a combination of erosion and the partial collapse of one of the island's shield volcanoes. Waimea Canyon State Park has lookout points over Kaua'i's stunning Na Pali cliffs, as well as numerous hiking trails through and around the canyon, a wilderness lover's delight. Helicopter ride over Kaua'i . Way more thrilling than a day at the beach is a helicopter ride over the interior of Kaua'i, most of which is too densely forested and mountainous for wheeled vehicles. Numerous helicopter companies (most based in Lihu'e) offer up-in-the-air jaunts over waterfall-striped Mt Wai'ale'ale, the island's central shield volcano and one of the wettest spots on Earth, and the sheer-hewn sea cliffs of the Na Pali coast, accessible otherwise only by ocean kayak. MOLOKAI . Kalaupapa National Historical Park . Hansen's disease (leprosy) was introduced to Hawaii by foreigners in 1835, and soon spread through the islands. King Kamehameha V, in an attempt to stop the epidemic, created a law banishing all those afflicted to this remote peninsula jutting out from beneath the towering sea cliffs (the world's highest) of Molokai's north coast, which became the final home for the unhappy exiles. Around 40 years later, a compassionate Belgian missionary named Father Damien came to visit, and remained with the colony for 16 years, when he died after contracting the disease himself (Father Damien was officially canonized by the Catholic Church in 2009). The enforced isolation law was finally revoked in 1969; today, only a handful of patients, all senior citizens, remain. You can visit the peninsula to see the village and Father Damien's church and gravesite only by pre-arranged tour -- either flying down to the peninsula (which takes about eight minutes) or riding a mule down a steep, 2-mile (3.2km) route zigzagging across the cliffs. © 2011 Lonely Planet.

"Washington (CNN) -- A divided federal appeals court has ruled that federal regulators went too far with new rules to control air pollution in parts of the eastern United States. The decision Tuesday is a blow for several states, the Obama administration and environmental groups, which had sought to prevent ""upwind states"" from emitting possibly unhealthy levels of contaminants across state borders, a requirement known as the ""good neighbor"" policy. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia concluded that the Environmental Protection Agency exceeded its authority when imposing the restrictions. ""When EPA quantified states' good neighbor obligations, it did not allow the states the initial opportunity to implement the required reductions with respect to sources within their borders,"" the 2-1 panel said. ""By doing so, EPA departed from its consistent prior approach to implementing the good neighbor provision and violated the act."" The issue was tossed back to federal officials to rewrite the regulations. A number of states and power companies had sued over the July 2011 rule limiting power plant emissions in 28 ""upwind"" states. The court opinion written by Judge Brett Kavanaugh said some upwind states were unfairly being required to reduce emissions ""by more than their own significant contributions to a downwind state's nonattainment."" Kavanaugh described a ""Catch-22"" scenario that would make it hard for states to comply with federal rules. ""EPA faults the states for not hitting that impossible-to-know target with their (State Implementation Plans) submissions,"" Kavanaugh said. ""In effect, EPA's view is that the only chance states have to hit the target is before EPA defines the target. By the time EPA makes the target clear, it's already too late for the states to comply."" He was supported by Judge Thomas Griffith. Both were named to the bench by President George W. Bush. Less stringent rules set up by the Bush administration will now go into place until the rules are rewritten. The requirement is known as the Transport or Cross-State Air Pollution Rule. Under the Clean Air Act, the good neighbor provision requires upwind states to bear responsibility for what the appeals court said was their fair share of ""the mess"" in downwind states. In dissent, Judge Judith Rogers said the court majority exceeded its authority, ignoring congressional intent. ""The result is an unsettling of the consistent precedent of this court strictly enforcing jurisdictional limits, a redesign of Congress's vision of cooperative federalism between the states and the federal government in implementing the CAA based on the court's own notions of absurdity and logic that are unsupported by a factual record, and a trampling on this court's precedent on which the (EPA) was entitled to rely in developing the Transport Rule rather than be blindsided by arguments raised for the first time in this court,"" wrote Rogers, a Clinton appointee to the appeals court. Environmental groups also criticized the ruling. ""This decision allows harmful power plant air pollution to continue to aggravate major health problems and foul up our air. This is a loss for all of us but especially for those living downwind from major polluters,"" said John Walke of the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""This rule would have prevented thousands of premature deaths and saved tens of billions of dollars a year in health costs, but two judges blocked that from happening and forced EPA to further delay long overdue health safeguards for Americans."" But Texas was among those states critical of the administration's new rules. ""Yet another federal court has reined in an overreaching EPA for violating federal law and intruding on Texas sovereignty,"" Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said. ""Vindicating the state's objections to EPA's aggressive and lawless approach, today's decision is an important victory for federalism and a rebuke to a federal bureaucracy run amok."" The federal government now has the option now of asking the Supreme Court to accept the case for review. The agency finalized separate new federal standards on toxic pollutants and mercury emissions from coal power plants last fall. That move was praised by environmentalists but criticized by others, who predict lost jobs and a strain on the nation's power grid. Lawsuits over those new rules have been filed. The case decided Tuesday is EME Homer City Generation LP v. EPA (11-1302).","The regulations sought to limit contaminants released by ""upwind states""

"(CNN) -- One of the UK's most critically endangered butterflies is making a comeback thanks to a profit making partnership between private landowners and conservation organizations. The heath fritillary -- a rare species exclusive to the south of England that thrives in cleared woodland environments -- has declined sharply over the past 25 years as forest clearing has become less common. But population numbers are on the rise again after the introduction of a forestry management scheme that enables rural landowners to cash in by creating butterfly habitats on their property. ""We were down to 12 colonies (of heath fritillary) in 1995 and most of those were very small,"" says Dr. Martin Warren, chief executive of Butterfly Conservation, the organization behind the projects implementation. ""Since then we've been able to work with landowners to get the management back up again and we are now looking at 25 colonies in the same area."" See also: Butterfly farmers help protect threatened forests . The conservation scheme works by first sourcing locations where there are remnants of heath fritillary colonies. Those who own the land identified during this process -- be they individuals, businesses or wildlife trusts -- are then approached for permission to carry out the conservation work. This primarily consists of clearing the areas pinpointed of their indigenous plant life and repopulating them with the lighter foliage the heath fritillary requires to prosper. If landowners agree to take part in the project, they are then able to sell on the discarded lumber that accumulates during the clearing and ensuing maintenance process at a profit. See also: Brazil tries to balance farming and forests . ""A lot of this is about persuasion,"" says Warren. ""You have to deal with loads of different people who all have their own agenda and financial constraints."" ""When you go in there and say 'there is a rare butterfly on your land' you can sometimes get a very bad response,"" he adds. Although Warren admits the profit margins remain relatively small at this stage and that the scheme itself relies on grants from the Forestry Commission to break even, he sees potential for much larger projects in the future. He says that there are currently numerous sites throughout the UK -- where nearly three quarters of butterfly species have seen their numbers decline in the last 10 years -- being scouted for their suitability by Butterfly Conservation. There are also scores of endangered butterfly species across Europe that could benefit from the implementation of similar cleared woodland schemes, he adds. See also: Can wooden skyscrapers transform concrete jungle? ""There are a whole suite of them (countries) where woodlands are not being managed to the detriment of butterflies,"" says Warren. Yet despite his enthusiasm for the project, Warren cautions that there must be a balance struck between maintaining natural forest environments and manipulating their makeup through woodland clearing. ""We wouldn't advocate every woodland area be managed as there are many other species that depend on mature woodland to thrive,"" he says. If an equilibrium between profit, species conservation and respecting natural forest ecosystems can be achieved however, all kinds of diverse forest wildlife could benefit, he adds.","One of Britain's most critically endangered butterflies is making a comeback .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A new credit rating agency backed by Chinese, Russian and American firms has launched today in Hong Kong, with a mission to displace the ""Big Three"" Western firms at the heart of the international ratings system. The joint venture, the Universal Credit Rating Group (UCRG), says it intends to reform the current international credit rating regime, creating the initial framework for a new system by 2020, with the ability to provide credit risk information on all the world's economies by 2025. Beijing-based Dagong Global Credit Rating, Russia's RusRating and U.S.-based agency Egan-Jones Ratings are behind the project, which they consider part of a necessary overhaul of a system whose failings contributed to the 2008 global financial crisis. Currently, ratings issued by the Big Three -- Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch -- to large-scale borrowers, such as governments and corporations, play a central role in determining how investors allocate billions of dollars. Their ratings indicate to buyers of debt how likely they are to be paid back. During the financial crisis, the ratings agencies were criticized for giving top ratings to mortgage-backed securities that eventually cratered, sparking a deep global recession. Sean Egan, president of Egan-Jones Ratings and director of the UCRG, believes there's been inadequate reform of the international credit ratings system since the crisis. ""Obviously there's a been a breakdown of the system, obviously there's yet to be any sort of tangible reform,"" he said. ""That is really the impetus for seeking some alternatives for global institutional investors."" Guan Jianzhong, chairman and president of Dagong Global Credit Rating and chairman of the UCRG, said reform was essential to the recovery of the world economy. ""Credit ratings are indispensible in global economic operation, and it is obvious that the current rating system needs reforming and introducing new thinking,"" he said in a press release. Egan said the venture would bring a more international perspective to ratings and provide greater accountability. ""It's not going to represent the, you could argue, parochial interests of New York-based firms. There's going to be a variety of perspectives included as a result of a variety of ratings firms being part of it,"" he said. A ""self-policing "" mechanism would see contributors' ratings assessed over time, he said. ""It addresses the major problem you've had, whereby if a rating at the triple-A level is issued and quickly downgraded, the rating firm has historically just said 'We're sorry, but thank you very much for the rating fee.'"" He said the response to the proposal had been better than he had anticipated. ""The timing is right, the parties are right, the interest is there,"" he said. ""Capital providers in the form of Asian and some Middle Eastern institutions have not had a seat at the table and have been terribly burnt as a result."" Observers have welcomed the move, saying the new agency could be a viable competitor, but will need time to establish its credibility. ""I'm of the view: the more the better,"" said Avonechith Siackhachanh, senior advisor in the Asian Development Bank's Office of Regional Economic Integration. ""Anything to introduce greater competition -- it will encourage everybody to have better discipline. But I think it will take time for this new rating agency to establish itself."" The fact that the agency was giving itself a decent time frame to start up ""gives me some comfort that it has a chance to succeed,"" she said. She rejected the argument that U.S.-based ratings firms had parochial interests, saying it was ""not that black and white,"" but agreed that insufficient reforms of the ratings regime taken place since the crisis. ""Perhaps more ratings agencies in the market will promote reform in the long run.""","Credit rating agency launched in Hong Kong with Chinese, Russian and American backing .

"(CNN) -- The ""extraordinary"" rush to develop an Ebola vaccine is moving forward apace, the lead researcher told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Tuesday, adding that the fast pace may engender ethical concerns about how it the vaccine is eventually implemented. ""This is, frankly, extraordinary,"" Adrian Hill of the Jenner Institute at Oxford University said. ""We are trying to do in a few months something that might typically take 10 years. We've had accelerated reviews of all our applications, regulatory and ethical approvals, and so on."" ""And we're now trying to proceed so quickly that if things go well, by the end of the year, this vaccine might actually be being used in the three affected countries in West Africa."" He said that the vaccine has been shown to be ""really quite remarkably protective"" in studies on monkeys at the National Institutes of Health in the U.S. Ebola drugs are in the works . Researchers are under tremendous pressure to develop a vaccine, as over 3,400 people have died in West Africa and a Spanish nurse's assistant was confirmed on Monday to be the first person to have contracted the virus outside of Africa. But even if researchers are able to make enough vaccine, and have data showing that it is safe for use in humans and produces good immune responses, Hill said that they will would not know that ""it actually works."" ""So we're going to have to figure out a way of using the vaccine, and at the same time evaluating it. And there's a great deal of discussion about how you might do that now."" Therein may lie ethical concerns. Your Ebola questions answered . There is little worry, he said, about administering a vaccine to humans in a phase one trial, as he said will begin this week in West Africa. The issue is what you do after that. ""Once you've shown safety in those individuals, do you go on to deploy the vaccine in a very large population -- ideally of health-care workers who are at greatest risk -- without knowing that the vaccine actually works?"" ""Or instead, do you wait several months -- maybe six months, maybe a year -- to prove absolutely that the vaccine has a certain efficacy and then start thinking about deploying it widely?"" ""And if you wait that long, the epidemic might either be over, or the whole thing might be completely out of control."" Tobacco plant may be key to Ebola drugs . ""So that's the challenge -- to figure out what the best thing to do, given those conflicting priorities as I've described them.""","There is ""extraordinary"" rush to develop Ebola vaccine, says scientist Adrian Hill .
Ethical questions arise in regard to when widely distribute vaccine, says Hill .

"Washington (CNN) -- Most Americans -- and most American Catholics -- think Pope Benedict XVI has done a bad job of dealing with the problem of sexual abuse by Catholics priests, according to a new national poll. CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey results released Friday also indicate that recent revelations about that matter have hurt the pope's standing with the public. Fifty-nine percent of American Catholics questioned in the poll have a favorable view of the pope, down 19 points from February. Among all Americans, the slippage is even greater: from 59 percent in February to just 35 percent today. ""Only a quarter of U.S. Catholics have an unfavorable view of the pope, but they don't seem satisfied with his track record on the growing and persistent scandal within the church,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. According to the survey, 56 percent of U.S. Catholics disapprove of how Pope Benedict XVI has dealt with the problem of sexual abuse committed by priests; only about one in three Catholics has a positive view of how he has dealt with that subject. An even larger number -- 74 percent -- disapproves of how the church overall has handled that matter. Pope Benedict XVI called for ""penitence"" Thursday for the church's ""sins"" amid the sex abuse scandal that has embroiled the Roman Catholic Church, according to Italy's official news agency. Allegations against the church have piled up this year across Europe, including in Austria, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland. Pope Benedict XVI has found himself tied to the crisis after news broke last month that 30 years ago, when he was an archbishop, he approved accommodations in his diocese for a priest accused of child sex abuse so the priest could undergo therapy. The priest, who was not identified, was let go from church service in 2008, according to church officials in Germany. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted April 9-11, with 1,008 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points and plus or minus 6.5 percentage points for the 231 American Catholics questioned. CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","59 percent of American Catholics polled have favorable view of pope .

"Washington (CNN) -- With his budget approved by the House, Paul Ryan is turning his attention to Iowa to headline a high-profile Republican event that will only fuel speculation he's laying the groundwork for a potential presidential run in 2016. Lawmakers approved the Wisconsin Republican's 2015 spending plan on Thursday. But there were notable conservative defections, making his appearance at Friday's Lincoln Dinner in Cedar Rapids more interesting. The question that confronts Ryan is whether his budget, dubbed the ""path to prosperity,"" will help pave a path for him to compete in the early contest state in two years. Or will it prove a political liability when Republicans choose their next White House nominee? Ryan's role as the chief fiscal expert in the GOP is the main reason he was tapped as Mitt Romney's running mate in 2012, and remains his main calling card in a potential national campaign. Since Republicans took control of the House in 2010, top GOP leaders have deferred to the Budget Committee chairman to construct the party's blueprint to address the growing national debt. He has shepherded four budgets through the House and brokered a deal with Democrats last fall to avoid another government shutdown and possible default on the nation's credit limit. Ryan budget details . Some say not aggressive enough . But that resume has not won over some tea party groups who believe Ryan isn't' being aggressive enough about slashing the size of the federal government. The group of fiscal conservatives in the House introduced an alternative budget that balances the federal budget in four years, instead of the 10 years in Ryan's plan. Former 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, who previously backed Ryan's budgets, called this version ""a joke."" In all, a dozen Republicans voted against his bill, a mix of conservatives who wanted the swifter cuts and moderates in competitive seats who may be worried about political fallout. ""I don't think it helps him at all,"" Tammy Kobza, Iowa State director for the Eagle Forum, a conservative group, told CNN when asked if Ryan's record crafting GOP budgets could be a basis for 2016 presidential campaign in Iowa. Kobza isn't ready to endorse any GOP candidate in the next presidential race yet, but she says there are other activists who will attend Friday's dinner who share her view that Ryan isn't conservative enough to win the party's nomination. ""Paul Ryan seems like a very nice man, someone I'd love to have like a next door neighbor,"" Kobza said, but she grouped him in with ""Washington Republicans"" who she said ""have no clue what's going on in real world America."" Jim Carley, President of Save Our American Republic (SOAR), a conservative grassroots group in Iowa, said he supported most of what Ryan had in previous proposals, but he admitted he hasn't focused on the details of Ryan's latest plan. Ryan's dilemma . Iowa conservatives . He told CNN that conservatives in Iowa are determined to get the federal budget in balance, and although he understands it may take some time, ""you're going to have some people that are never happy."" Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who has been making his own trips to Iowa to drum up interest in a likely presidential campaign, told CNN he is ""a fan"" of Ryan's. But he said voters in Iowa would have to decide about the political consequences of his budget. When pressed on whether he backs Ryan budget blueprint, Cruz declined to answer, saying his focus was on the Senate. But some Iowa Republicans say Ryan's willingness to tackle tough issues appeals to conservatives there who are especially concerned about the nation's debt. Iowans hold the lowest credit card debt in the country, according to Transunion. ""There is a tremendous amount of affection among Republicans I talk to, especially with the small business and donor community,"" former Iowa GOP Chair Matt Strawn, who is not affiliated with any potential 2016 candidate, said of Ryan in a phone interview. ""They appreciate he isn't just saying no, he's attempting to demonstrate that he's a solution oriented conservative."" Ryan's Poverty push . Other issues energize voters . Republican activists and strategists say right now Iowa voters are energized about issues other than cutting federal spending. The backlash to the National Security Agency's surveillance program is pulling people toward Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul, who has seized on the issue, and is tapping into his father Ron Paul's infrastructure in the state. And the base's continued zeal to roll back Obamacare is something that Cruz has highlighted during his visits to the state. But these same Republicans also say the kitchen table issues that Ryan's budget addresses will generates enthusiasm among caucus goers when the election comes around in 2016. ""Iowa Republicans like somebody who is put forward serious proposals."" Tim Albrecht, a former aide to GOP Gov. Terry Branstad, told CNN. He believes Ryan's budget will be an asset and shows ""he's a thoughtful, smart leader, unafraid to make tough decisions and put together tough proposals that don't necessarily endear him to the east coast elite."" Albrecht suggests that it's time though for Ryan to move beyond the spreadsheets and the numbers in the budget plans and demonstrate how his proposals will work in people's lives. ""If he can explain to Joe Citizen how it helps them help their pocketbook then he'll be successful."" Ryan well known . Veteran Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley told CNN that he expects Ryan to have a ""good following"" when he visits the state. He pointed out that some ""economic conservatives and libertarians"" within the Iowa GOP may not be exactly on the same page with Ryan's approach, but said these groups ""don't necessarily disagree with him but it's a matter of emphasis for them."" Republicans agree that Ryan is well known in the state from the 2012 campaign and it helps that he comes from neighboring Wisconsin, and shares Iowans love of the outdoors. But Friday's visit is only Ryan's second to the state since the 2012 presidential campaign,. Paul, Cruz, former senator and 2012 GOP candidate Rick Santorum have been to the state more often, and GOP strategists say if serious about running for president Ryan needs to start spending more time cultivating support there. Democrats aren't waiting until 2016 to put Ryan's budget proposal front and center in the November midterms. While congressional Republicans insist the fallout from Obamacare will help them regain control of the Senate and increase their majority in the House, Democrats believe Ryan's budget is key to their election prospects this fall. They say its proposed spending cuts and changes to entitlement programs are issues that will energize their base which has been deflated because of the series of problems with the health care law. Dems to highlight Ryan budget . Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer has called the focus on the Ryan budget this spring ""a turning point"" and a ""gift"" to Democrats. In Iowa Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley, who is running to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, told CNN the Ryan budget will be a major focus as he talks to voters. ""No matter who my opponent is going to be they've all been out at public meetings talking about where they stand on these issues - and where they stand on these issues is not very different from what's contained in the Paul Ryan budget. They're going to have to own up to whether they stand behind this philosophy of governing,"" Braley said. Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana may be one of the most vulnerable candidates seeking re-election this fall, and points out that her likely opponent, GOP Rep Bill Cassidy, has repeatedly voted for Ryan's budgets. ""I most certainly plan to point out how my opponent has advocated to raise the retirement age to 70. I most certainly plan to point out how some of the proposals in that budget undercut the support for the middle class in Louisiana so I think there are just any number of things,"" Landrieu told CNN. Another Senate Democrat facing a tough race, Alaska Sen. Mark Begich, said ""elements"" of the Ryan budget will play prominently in his race. He told CNN that those Republican candidates vying to defeat him have already linked themselves to the ""pretty draconian cuts"" to education and entitlement programs that he believes will alarm voters in his state. Dems to focus on Ryan budget . Could attacks strengthen Ryan? But Iowa Republicans believe that attacks from Democrats could strengthen Ryan going into 2016. ""If anything the howls coming from Democrats are an asset,"" Strawn told CNN, adding, ""even those conservatives who would want to see more cuts, quicker, when they see Ryan being attacked, those Republicans and conservatives will rally."" While three House Republicans competing for the GOP nomination for a Senate seat in Georgia opposed the Ryan bill, seeking to show conservative primary voters they wanted deeper cuts, GOP Senate Leader Mitch McConnell, who is battling his own tough re-election campaign in Kentucky, said earlier this week he supported it. ""My personal view is - I think the Ryan budget is a step in the right direction,"" McConnell said Tuesday. He also indicated that most Senate Republicans backed the plan. Grassley maintains that it's too early to tell which potential GOP candidate has an edge with potential 2016 Iowa caucus-goers, and he said based on discussions with Republicans ""of all stripes"" in the state Ryan is on equal footing with others in the field. But referring to some of the other potential Republican candidates who have executive rather than congressional experience, Grassley said right now there is an ""anti-Washington feeling which I think gives some edge to governors.""","Ryan headed to Lincoln Day dinner in Iowa .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- British journalist Paul Martin was released without charge Thursday, a month after Hamas officials arrested him in Gaza, his lawyer and the British Foreign Office said. Martin was at the British consulate in Jerusalem, the Foreign Office said. His family said they expect him to fly home to London over the weekend. Ahmed Yousef, an adviser to Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh, said the decision to release Martin was made as a ""good will gesture"" and was in response to the many calls they had received to let him go. Yousef said many lawmakers, press organizations, and even South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu had been communicating with Hamas about his release. Martin is a documentary maker who has worked for the BBC, ITN, and other broadcasters, and reported for the British newspaper The Times. He was arrested February 14 by Hamas on suspicions he was involved with Israeli espionage activity. Hamas initially detained Martin for two weeks, but extended his detention for 15 more days. Officials from Hamas, the Islamic militant group that rules Gaza, suggested at the time of Martin's arrest that he had been communicating with a Palestinian affiliated with the rival Fatah movement and whom Hamas had accused of collaboration with Israel. Yousef said in the end, Hamas did not have enough evidence to push the case further. He said Martin, who also holds a South African passport, had been declared persona non grata in Gaza and that it would be ""dangerous for him to come back."" Martin's wife, Anne, said the family was ""extremely relieved"" at her husband's release. ""Paul is an experienced and highly regarded foreign correspondent with 30 years' experience,"" she wrote in a statement. ""He is an innocent man who went into Gaza to testify in the trial of a Palestinian whom he had interviewed for a documentary. Paul has maintained his innocence throughout this ordeal."" As Martin was leaving Gaza, a reporter asked him about the Hamas allegations. Martin replied, ""Ridiculous, ridiculous,"" before closing the door of the car and driving away. British consular officials had been allowed to visit Martin while he was jailed and the British Foreign office had publicly called for his release. The Tel Aviv Foreign Press Association had also called on Hamas to release Martin, asking the group ""to respect the rights of every journalist on assignment, to work without fear of being arrested."" Before Hamas took over Gaza in 2007, the kidnapping and abduction of foreign journalists was a frequent occurrence as part of the factional warfare in the territory. Since that time, no foreign journalists have been abducted. BBC journalist Alan Johnston was being held by another group in 2007, and was released shortly after Hamas took power. Palestinian journalists are subject to various forms of restriction and intimidation by authorities in Gaza, but Martin's case was the first time Hamas had arrested a foreign journalist.","British journalist Paul Martin freed without charge by Hamas after month-long detention .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Let's say you were making a film. Which do you think would be harder? A. Coordinating a mass alien invasion B. Invoking tidal waves and tornadoes C. Telling a prehistoric love story. Roland Emmerich and Steven Strait (D'Leh) discuss a scene shot in Namibia when the young hunter discovers farming for the first time. For Roland Emmerich, the answer is C. He says ""10,000 BC"" is without a doubt the most difficult film he's ever made. It wasn't the time-consuming graphics that took the greatest toll, nor the need to re-record a lot of the dialogue. No, the most challenging aspect of this film was, um, the weather. ""You're obsessed with the weather channel,"" Emmerich says, of the duration of filming. ""Ninety percent of this movie was [shot] outdoors."" Producer Michael Wimer: ""It seemed like every time we needed sun, we'd get rain, every time we needed green landscape, we'd get snow. There we just got a series of curve balls, the weather is really fickle."" Emmerich says: ""It's like somebody didn't like 'Day After Tomorrow' and was like: 'We showed him.'"" Filming started in the wintry peaks of New Zealand's South Island, then moved to Cape Town in South Africa, then further north to the desert of Namibia. But it wasn't just the weather that tested the filmmakers' skill, patience and stamina.  see scenes from the film » . Prehistoric beasts . Visual effects supervisor Karen Goulekas started working on project two years before principal filming even started. She broke down the script to see what could be done, and what couldn't, then set about the bringing prehistoric animals back to life. Perhaps her biggest challenge was to create the film's ""terror birds"", flightless predators with huge beaks that hunt like sharks, suddenly piercing through long grass to snatch their prey before disappearing again. The birds were based on a number of images. During filming the terrifying bird was actually a blue head on a stick. ""It's been an experience,"" says Camilla Belle (Evolet), ""I've never worked with blue birds before and all that fun stuff.""  see D'Leh take on the terror birds » . Sets . After seeing off all manner of prehistoric threats, the film's hero D'Leh and his assembled army are awestruck by an immense 'lost' civilization dominated by pyramids that reach up into the sky. Not only did the filmmaker build the pyramids (at Dune 7 in Namibia), they also built miniature replicas of the pyramids, 'God's palace', the slave quarters and the Nile River. The buildings were made in Munich before being transport to Namibia in 15 sea containers. Once assembled, they covered an area of 100 square meters. see the pyramids during a battle scene in the film . Costumes . What to wear when you live in 10,000 BC? Presumably there wasn't much choice in those days, which gave the film's costume designers plenty of scope to use their imagination. They dressed the Yagahl tribe, or mammoth hunters, in antelope fur and hides in place of mammoth. But the weather was so cold during filming that some actors also wore thermals underneath. The final scenes required dressing 800 extras as slaves. Each costume had to be handmade to conceal the stitching. Says costume designer Renee April: ""We had an army in the workshops making beads from clay and glass and sewing them onto the costumes as well as making the fabric and headdresses."" 1000 sandals also had to be made to order. Sound . Most of the dialogue in the film had to be recorded not once, but twice. Peter Gleaves, an Automated Dialogue Replacement Mixer at De Lane Lea Studios in Soho, London explains: ""The original sound sometimes has background noises -- wind machines, sounds of cars and aeroplanes -- that in a production like '10,000 BC' you don't want to hear. So to get rid of them you have to get the actors to redo all their lines, or most of their lines."" Steven Strait was summoned to London to re-record some of his dialogue. When the Revealed cameras dropped in he was working on his grunts. see Steven Strait grunting and panting! ""It's an action sequence,"" Strait explains, ""so there are very few words. It's mostly just running and jumping and grunting and doing all sorts of strange sound effects that are going to look incredibly weird in this room, but hopefully it works in the film."" see the final product of Steven's grunting, the mammoth hunt .","Emmerich developed obsession with the weather during filming of ""10,000 BC""

"Silverstone, England (CNN) -- Fortune can be a fickle mistress in Formula One. Home hero Lewis Hamilton was dejected and apologetic after a mistake in qualifying but Silverstone rang with fans chanting his name as he fought back to win the British Grand Prix. His victory was won at the expense of his Mercedes teammate and title rival Nico Rosberg, who retired with a broken gearbox. The German had taken pole position and was leading at just over the halfway point before the pendulum of bad luck swung his way on lap 29. It was the first time Rosberg has retired this season while, in contrast, Hamilton had failed to cross the finish line twice. ""Yesterday was a really difficult day,"" Hamilton, who was knocked back to sixth on the grid after choosing to pit rather than finish a final timed lap in qualifying, told reporters at the historic Silverstone circuit. ""You could say it was a real kick in the balls. I really had to pull up my socks and get on it. ""I went away feeling terrible. I felt I really let the fans, the team and myself down. Determined Hamilton . ""Coming back today to turn that emptiness around was really my priority. This weekend showed you never give up."" Hamilton's second British GP victory -- earned exactly six years after his fantastic 2008 win in the wet -- was not only about personal redemption, it was also about closing the gap in the F1 world championship. Luck has been on Rosberg's side at the previous three races, the 29-year-old winning in Monaco and Austria and finishing second in Canada. Hamilton's home win means he is now just four points behind Rosberg, who was still smiling as he chatted to reporters in the Mercedes motor home after the race. The Mercedes duo will now renew their rivalries at the German Grand Prix on 20 July -- and Mercedes chairman Niki Lauda, a three-time world champion himself, is predicting fireworks now Hamilton is back to his best. ""Lewis from the beginning of the season was on a very good stable level and Nico after Monaco had everything going for him,"" Lauda said. ""But now Lewis is back on track so I tell you the next couple of races are going to be interesting. Highly motivated . ""He is highly motivated and for me the most important thing is that this victory gives him a real push about his qualities, what he can achieve so there will be no ups-and-downs with him anymore. ""Everything is reset like before. So they will fight until the end like you do not believe to be world champion. ""It's interesting to watch now because they are exactly the same level."" Rosberg: Mercedes has not peaked yet . There was also a turnaround in fortune for the Williams team, who saw their cars start out of position after failing to choose the right tires in a rain-hit qualifying. Valterri Bottas hustled his way through the field with some impressive overtaking to finish a brilliant second in the car Susie Wolff had driven on Friday for four laps before it ground to halt with an engine problem. ""We're on the right way,"" said the Finn, who finished third last time out in Austria. ""One step more to go. ""You see how quick the car is. It was a pleasure to drive. I was able to go through the field. I'm really, really happy."" Fine third . Daniel Ricciardo finished third for Red Bull Racing, the same position his teammate Sebastian Vettel had started the race from. While the four-time world champion came in for fresh tires twice, Ricciardo switched to a one-stop strategy, which moved him onto the podium. ""I didn't intend on doing a one-stop but we were able to keep the pace, so we stayed on and just held on at the end,"" the Australian explained. ""It was awesome. All three of us had a bit of redemption on our plate today. It was a pretty dismal Saturday for us so we're all pretty happy. This is definitely one of my best podiums this year."" A bit further down the road, Vettel found himself engaged in a thrilling duel with Ferrari's Fernando Alonso. Both drivers flexed their egos, complaining about each other's driving style on the pit-to-car radios but in the end Vettel swooped past Alonso for fifth place. Early incident . The dramatic race had been delayed for an hour after a crash involving Kimi Raikkonen's Ferrari on the opening lap. The Finn, who has had a difficult season since returning to the Italian team, lost control as he turned into the Wellington Straight. As he rejoined the track at speed, the car kicked out into repeated spins. The Finn plunged into the barriers on the right and then collided with Felipe Massa's Williams -- the damage enough to end the Brazilian's 200th grand prix in miserable fashion. The Ferrari spokesman told the media: ""Kimi is OK. He obviously got a big hit. He only seems to be having some bruises to his ankle and a little bit on his knee."" The bruising 2014 championship continues at the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim in two week's time.","Lewis Hamilton wins British GP in front of home fans .

"(CNN) -- Amid the skyscrapers, sidewalks and subways of New York City, scientists have discovered a new species of frog within view of the Statue of Liberty. In fact, the researchers who discovered the frog say the center of its range is Yankee Stadium in the Bronx. The newly identified animal is among more than a dozen distinct leopard frog species. And, while it's fairly common to find new species of animals in the remote wildness or in rain forests, to discover one in marshes and ponds within an urban area such as New York is nothing short of amazing, according to Leslie Rissler, program director with the National Science Foundation. ""The species is completely distinct,"" said Rissler, part of the team of scientists that found the species. ""It has a very small range and it was quite a surprise to find a new species in New York City."" World's smallest frog discovered; it fits easily on a dime . Researchers used DNA testing to find this so-called cryptic species, which is one species hidden within another. Researchers basically stumbled across the new frog, Rissler said, adding the discovery is ""extremely rare."" ""We were doing a study on a related organism, the southern leopard frog, in my lab at the University of Alabama and another colleague contacted us to say we have these frogs that look like southern leopard frogs, but they don't quite sound like southern leopard frogs, can you add some of these to your genetic analyses? And we did and that sort of began the study."" Scientist Jeremy Feinberg at Rutgers University first noticed the new amphibian sounded different from the northern and southern leopard frogs and that it had ""weird-sounding calls."" Feinberg said the frog had a ""peculiar croak."" It didn't have the ""long snore"" or ""rapid chuckle"" other leopard frogs have. The new frog had a ""short, repetitive croak."" Feinberg says he knew from the get-go there was something odd about the frog. ""When I first heard these frogs calling, it was so different, I knew something was very off."" And the DNA analysis proved him right. The species is so new it doesn't even have a name yet. And Rissler said there won't be any naming contests for this new amphibian, either. ""I think some people would like to name it, who knows, Staten I, a lot of things to do with New York City,"" Rissler told CNN. ""However, we have to go back to these different museums, find the exact voucher specimen that was used for these other species and, if there is an old name that's available then we will use that name because that's the proper way to do it, rather than taking bids on who wants to name the new frog in New York.""","New frog species discovered in New York City area .

"(CNN) -- Our genes play a major role in making us who we are, but a lot of information about their function has been mysterious. That's why an international team of researchers set out to figure out what the working parts of the human genome are, and what they mean for the human body as we know it. The project is called the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE). When the Human Genome Project sequenced the human genome in 2003, it established the order of the 3 billion letters in the genome, which can be thought of as ""the book of life."" ENCODE is about interpreting that -- understanding which genetic variants affect biochemical function, and which ones are associated with disease. ""This is the science for this century,"" said Ewan Birney of the European Bioinformatics Institute and lead analysis coordinator for ENCODE in a news conference Wednesday. ""This century, we are going to be working out how we make humans starting from this simple instruction manual."" ENCODE has begun to reveal the circuitry, networks and choreography within the human genome, said Dr. Eric Green, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, at the briefing. More than 30 scientific papers from the project are being published on it, in journals including Nature, Genome Research and Genome Biology. Scientists have determined that there are 4 million sites in the genome where specific biochemical events occur, most of which have been discovered with ENCODE. That means if you got your genome sequenced, there could be as many as 4 million differences between you and the person sitting next to you, Michael Snyder, a Stanford University professor who is the principal investigator for ENCODE, told CNN. These sites are ""switches,"" which determine which proteins and cells are going to be made, Richard Myers of HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, an ENCODE collaborator, said at the briefing. Most genetic changes that are likely to cause disease, or are associated with disease, don't lie inside the genes themselves, but rather in these control elements, Snyder said. Before, scientists believed that a lot of the human genome was junk -- that as little as 5% of it actually had a purpose in encoding proteins, Myers said. So it was a surprise, according to ENCODE, to find a full 80% of the human genome sequence is associated with some biochemical function. ENCODE allows researchers to identify which mutations are most likely to cause disease and drug responses. In a study on associations with diseases, scientists found links to heart disease and type II diabetes. The regulatory switches can cause problems with genes that can lead to disease. ""Before, they were just mysterious events; now we can say, 'Well, they're associated with a particular problem,'"" Snyder said. Snyder, who has had his own genome sequenced, believes personal genome sequencing will become an important part of health care. In his own case, genome sequencing revealed Snyder's risk for type II diabetes before his body started showing symptoms. Since he knew about the risk ahead of time, he was able to start managing his glucose levels early. With the new ENCODE information, Snyder could start seeing which variants he has that might affect gene function but don't lie inside the gene; they reside in the control switches. ""I think this will become standard of care for many people,"" he said of genomic sequencing. Still, there are issues with how much information about a sequence should be revealed to a person -- after all, just because a person has a genetic link to a disease, it doesn't necessarily mean that he or she will develop that condition, and the information could cause undue concern. Before ENCODE, scientists' knowledge was mostly about the exome, the protein coding sequences that account for about 1.5% of the genome, Snyder said. The remaining 98.5% was mysterious until the ENCODE project. A genome sequence as part of a research project costs under $4,000, but the proper interpretation costs a lot more, Snyder said. Some companies such as 23andMe offer DNA testing at a relatively low cost, but only sequence part of the genome. Even with what is known now, genome sequencing can benefit people with cancer. This technique played into the treatment of the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs. He underwent a sequencing of the genes of his cancer tumor and his normal DNA, so that his medical team could choose drugs that would be more precisely targeted at his disease, according to the biography ""Steve Jobs"" by Walter Isaacson. ""In my mind, it's a no-brainer to get your genome sequenced if you have cancer,"" Snyder said. The human genome has about 20,000 genes, and 1,000 of those genes are regulators -- the ""government"" of the genome, says Mark Gerstein of Yale University. Regulators bind to places in the genome, and then they turn genes near that binding site on and off. Gerstein and colleagues looked at the structure of these regulators, and determined that they have a somewhat corporate hierarchy structure. When you consider how information flows, it appears there are executives, managers and foremen. ENCODE received about $123 million over five years from the National Human Genome Research Institute, in addition to $40 for the pilot project and $125 million for relevant technology development and research since 2003. And there's still much more work to do, scientists say. ""It's a project that's not done, but it's a big step forward,"" Snyder said. More from CNN Health: Baby's DNA constructed before birth .

"(CNN) -- A previously unpublished collection of photographs from the wedding of John F. and Jacqueline Kennedy will be auctioned this month. The negatives of the photographs were found in 1993 in the darkroom of Arthur Burges, a World War II veteran and freelance photographer who was hired as a backup photographer for the wedding, according to Bobby Livingston, an executive vice president at RR Auction. ""They're relatively scarce,"" Livingston said. ""To come across a photo archive like this of such a famous event, they're a nice find."" The future first couple was married on September 12, 1953, at St. Mary's Church in Newport, Rhode Island. The event was also famously displayed in LIFE magazine with shots by photographer Lisa Larsen, according to Rachel Flor of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. The magazine called the wedding ""the most impressive the old society stronghold had seen in 30 years."" Letters reveal private thoughts of young Jackie Kennedy . Burges' photos, or the ""outtakes,"" as the auction house refers to them, include shots of the couple exiting the church and cutting the wedding cake. According to a press release from the Kennedy Museum, the wedding cake had five tiers and was accompanied by ""a luncheon of fruit cup, creamed chicken and ice cream sculpted to resemble roses."" Jacqueline Kennedy's wedding dress, captured in Burges' black and white stills, was made from 50 yards of ivory silk taffeta and took more than two months to make, according to the museum. Livingston estimated the collection of 13 shots will sell for several thousand dollars. The photos are being auctioned online through October 15. 50 years later, Jackie Kennedy's pink suit locked away from view .","13 negatives from 1953 Kennedy wedding found in 1993 .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- For Roland Emmerich, the easy choice would have been to join the family business. Roland Emmerich and his younger sister Ute as children in Germany. They now work together in Hollywood. His father had founded a thriving garden machinery company, but young Roland's interest in lawnmowers, and their like, was limited. ""I knew very early that I didn't want to do that,"" Emmerich says. ""But I also didn't know what I wanted to do, so I was dabbling in a lot of things. And then actually after a while, it slowly occurred to me that maybe film would be great."" He entered film school with the intention of becoming a production designer but came out a director. ""In film school, I had to make movies, so I made movies and was quite successful and all of a sudden I was a director."" The way he tells it makes it sound simple. And maybe it was. He went to one of Germany's leading film schools, The University of Television and Film Munich, which boasts an impressive alumni of respected directors: Wim Wenders, Bernd Eichinger, Uli Edel and Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, among others. He had the backing of a loving family; according to his sister Ute his ""very, very supportive"" father lent him office space in his factory and helped finance his early films.  Ute shows Revealed the family album » . Nor was he the first German director to make it big in Hollywood; Ernst Lubitsch and Billy Wilder had well and truly paved the way. What made Roland Emmerich different, and his Hollywood assent difficult, was his near obsession with special effects and monumental disasters; explosions, floods, tidal waves, and general destruction, both alien and earthly. Not only were his films expensive to make, but gallingly for German critics they weren't, well, very German. ""I was making movies like I'm doing now, but it was like a whole different world at that time in Germany,"" Emmerich says. ""They did Wim Wenders movies and all these kind of German movies and I just couldn't make movies like that. I wanted to make movies like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. I just did it and they were relatively successful, but critically more and more hated. They said: 'Why is he making movies like this here?'"" So now he's making films in Los Angeles, where he has a home just a few minutes drive from Hollywood, and his younger sister Ute.  Roland gives Revealed a tour of his home » . ""Ute was like me,"" Roland says. ""She didn't want to work in the family company and it was a good opportunity to work for me, it was more exciting."" The siblings set up their own production company, Centroplis Entertainment,  through which they've made 14 feature films. The move to Hollywood came after Roland directed ""Moon 44"", released in 1990; a science fiction action film set in 2038 about robots, convicts and companies fighting over mining rights in outer space. It earned him an invitation to Los Angeles and a job directing ""Universal Soldier."" Ute remembers, ""It was decided that we close our office [in Germany] and just try and see how it would work out for a year. Our parents, I think, were hoping that we would come back within a year, but eighteen years later, and so many movies and successes later, we are still here,"" she says. Roland has made himself very much at home in Los Angeles. Ten years ago he bought a house -- his own slice of Hollywood history -- a three bedroom mansion built in 1919 by Jesse Lasky, who, with Cecil B. DeMille, produced ""The Squaw Man,"" Hollywood's first feature film. ""I told Constance, my real estate broker, 'Look, don't come to me with something which doesn't have either Hollywood history or a really, really big garden'. I just wanted to have a big garden because I grew up in a house with a big garden."" In the end, he got both. The garden is an impressive oasis of towering palms, tangled vines and lush ferns, all lining an imposing staircase that leads to a pool where the director hosts parties for friends and colleagues. While Hollywood has embraced Roland Emmerich's action-packed, effect-laden style of epic story-telling, the director is less than enamored with its lifeblood, the film industry. ""I don't really like the movie business, I have to say. It's a very cold, brutal business. It's not a cozy living. But, on the other hand, I really like making movies,"" he says. ""I'm constantly torn between, should I keep going or not. And then I always want to make another movie and then I have to deal with it. But every time I come into a situation, I'm always talking about early retirement, which makes all my friends laugh out loud."" They might laugh out louder if he ever contemplated a return to the family business.","Roland Emmerich gave up potential role in family business to go to film school .

"(CNN) -- Recently, the United States has seen a resurgence of Bordetella pertussis, a highly contagious bacterial disease more commonly known as ""whooping cough."" The disease mostly afflicts children, though adults can catch it, too. Whooping cough is easily prevented with vaccination. According to the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention, vaccination, introduced in the 1940s, brought the number of cases per year down from 107,473 in 1922 to just 1,248 in 1981. Since 1982, however, the number of cases has steadily increased. In recent years, there has been a general decline in vaccination to prevent many childhood diseases in the United States. In 2012, the number of whooping cough cases in the United States hit a long-time high of 48,277. The decline in vaccination is in part due to the rise of the anti-vaccine movement, which has found spokespeople in celebrities like Jenny McCarthy and politicians like Michele Bachmann and Rick Santorum. It is a movement that relies on scientific fraud and pseudoscience. In the not too distant past, one of the scientific community's primary concerns was preventing scientific fraud. Episodes like the 1998 fabrication of data indicating a connection between childhood vaccines and autism risk have clear public health and policy repercussions. Claiming a link between vaccines and autism opens the door for false claims about the dangers of other vaccines, allowing, for example, politicians like Bachmann to inflame the public's doubts about the benefits of vaccination against the human papillomavirus, or HPV. In a 2011 interview on the ""Today"" show, Bachmann mentioned a woman whose daughter suffered from ""mental retardation"" as a result of receiving the HPV vaccination. In a subsequent interview, Bachmann defended her position, fueling the anti-vaccination movement. Given that HPV can result in cancer, disseminating this kind of misinformation not based on scientific evidence is dangerous. The general public thinks of scientific journals as unimpeachable, but the rise of e-commerce and e-media has created an unprecedented opportunity for charlatans to inflate credentials and corrupt scientific publications. In this process, pseudoscience has become rampant. In a recent article, ""Who's Afraid of Peer Review?"" published in Science, the flagship journal of The American Association for the Advancement of Science, John Bohannon revealed that it is relatively easy to publish fake scientific data in open-access journals. Unfortunately, Bohannon's piece barely received any attention from the popular media, squandering a vital opportunity to alert and inform the general public how to differentiate the wheat of real science from the chaff of pseudoscience. For the sake of public health, this issue must move beyond the confines of academia. The ideal behind open access journals is admirable: They aim to disseminate important scientific findings to audiences such as those in nonacademic settings or residing in developing countries who may not be have access to such information. But, the financial reality of open access is that the business model -- where an author agrees to pay a fee, often in the ballpark of $2,000, to get the article accepted for publication -- favors quantity and moneymaking over integrity. Such publications often fail to differentiate between the plastic Rolex and the real one. It is somewhat unnerving to read some of the comments posted below Bohannon's article, where a number of readers think ""scientific counterfeits"" are a fact of life, that falsifying data is old news, and that scientists should focus on our scientific work instead of worrying about counterfeiting. Scientists sometimes think it is not their role or responsibility to engage in public discourse regarding their work. In this instance, however, they could not be more wrong. As scientists, we have a responsibility to speak up about the damage that pseudoscience could inflict on society. For example, we are in the third decade of the AIDS pandemic, and there are still well-trained scientists such as Peter H. Duseberg, once an HIV/AIDS control and prevention adviser to the former president of South Africa, who denies that HIV causes AIDS. Duesberg says that recreational drugs are the culprits for AIDS among homosexual men in the West, while the cases in Africa are largely due to malnutrition and other diseases. People like Duesberg are not shy about spreading their half-baked, unproven ideas in spite of overwhelming contradictory scientific evidence. In this new business environment, publishers are often no longer responsible for preventing fake or less than credible data. Meanwhile, some scientists who have the financial resources might opt for a quick and easy publication, though their findings may be questionable. A key scientific currency, peer-reviewed publication, is being corrupted outright by the unscrupulous pursuit of profit. Sadly, the profit motive has begun to play an increasingly distortive role in the dissemination of scientific research findings. What's at stake here? Lives, obviously. Less dramatic, but no less important is the question of how we define ""knowledge,"" and how much we can trust science and scientists. Reasonable people can disagree on how to interpret data, but first, we need good data. The longer we turn a blind eye to scientific fraud, the more we encourage a pay-to-play system that puts dollars before scientific data, and the more we will erode the public's trust in science and its authority. That way is perilous. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frank Y. Wong.","Frank Wong: There's been a decline in vaccination to prevent childhood diseases .

"(CNN) -- Maybe you chickened out on the one-way trip to Mars that was being offered. But never fear, there's still a way for you to make a name for yourself. NASA is inviting the public to send their John and Jane Does to destinations beyond low-Earth orbit, including Mars. Spacey idea, right? Pack lightly, because your name will fly in comfort on a dime-sized microchip aboard an Orion spacecraft that launches on December 4.

""With each flight, selected individuals will accrue more miles as members of a global space-faring society,"" the agency's site says. There is a deadline for such important matters. To get your ""boarding pass"" for the first test flight, you'll need to submit your name by Halloween. What makes this more attractive is that it doesn't end in death on a barren planet.

In the days after the potential mission was announced, the company said it has received more than 10,000 emails from interested would-be spacefarers. Will it happen? No one knows for sure. The company says it needs $6 billion to fund the project. Check back in a few years. In the meantime, hedge your bets and send your name into space instead.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Justice Department is suing the state of California and Gov. Jerry Brown because prison authorities required a Sikh prison inmate to cut his beard. The lawsuit was filed Tuesday on behalf of Sukhjinder Basra, an inmate at prison in San Luis Obispo in central California. It said that the requirement violated the man's right ""to practice his religion"" under the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLIUPA). In the Sikh religion, which originated in northwestern India, unshorn hair is an article of faith. The Justice Department said the suit followed a probe ""that revealed that California's inmate grooming policy substantially burdens the rights of an inmate to practice his Sikh faith. "" ""The rights guaranteed by the Constitution extend to all people in the United States,"" said Andre Birotte Jr., U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California.  ""By protecting those rights -- even for those incarcerated -- we strengthen those rights for all."" The state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation was also named in the suit. RLUIPA, which became law in 2000, protects the religious freedom of people ""confined to institutions such as prisons, mental health facilities and state-run nursing homes,"" the Justice Department said.","Justice Department says the inmate has the right to practice his religion .

"(CNN) -- Mobile devices often get accused of alienating people from the world around them. But for U.S. teens, cell phones (especially text messaging) are a key way to stay connected with friends and other people in their lives, according to new research from the Pew Internet & American Life Project. Pew found that 63% of all teens say they exchange text messages every day with people in their lives, including their parents. Also, nearly half of all teens send and receive text messages with friends daily. In contrast, 28% teens say they never text their friends -- but then, 23% of teens don't have a cell phone at all. For teens, cell phones appear to correlate with social privilege. Nearly 90% of older teens (aged 14-17) have a cell phone, while just under 60% of 12- to 13-year-olds have a cell phone. White teens are most likely to have a cell phone (81%), vs. 72% of black teens and 63% of Hispanic teens. More than 90% of teens from households earning $75,000 or more annually have a cell phone, compared with 62% of teens from households earning less than $30,000 per year. Also, teens who live in the suburbs or whose parents graduated from college are most likely to have a cell phone. Only about one in four U.S. teens currently uses a smartphone, says Pew, in contrast to about 46% of U.S. adults. Interestingly, Pew found that smartphone-using teens are slightly less likely than teens with simpler feature phones to have recently used a computer to access the Internet. However, teens with smartphones also are ""substantially more likely than other teens to have used a tablet computer to go online in the last 30 days."" Teen girls (78%) slightly outnumber teen boys (78%) for cell phone ownership. And older teen girls tend to send and receive the most texts: a median of 100 per day. That said, teen boys now send 60% more texts daily than they did in 2009. Just over one-third of all parents of cell phone-using teens report using parental controls to help them manage their kids' cell phone use. These controls can include limits on which websites they can access, which apps they can download and limits on the amount or hours of texting. If their teens have simpler feature phones (rather than smartphones), parents are more likely to enable these controls. What aren't teens doing with their cell phones? E-mail and instant messaging, which lag in popularity behind texting. ""Increasingly, teens do not have the capability or the interest in exchanging instant messages or exchanging e-mail,"" Pew notes. ""Nearly two in five teens say they never or cannot exchange instant messaging, and another 39% of teens say they never exchange e-mail.""","Pew study: 63% of teens say they exchange text messages every day .

"(CNN) -- Every four years, hundreds of reporters, photojournalists, producers and other journalists take to the campaign trail to document every move of the men and women who want to become president. CNN is no different. Starting in 2011 and continuing into 2012, we unleashed our team of embeds -- reporters and producers who are ""embedded"" with presidential candidates for months at a time and send back the breaking and mundane news from the campaign trail. Our team of embeds -- including Peter Hamby, Rachel Streifeld, Shannon Travis and Shawna Shepherd -- report for both CNN TV and CNN digital throughout the 2012 campaign. On Tuesday June 5 at noon ET on cnn.com/roundtable, they will join host Wolf Blitzer -- a veteran of several campaigns himself -- for an exclusive live video chat about life on the campaign. Here are a few of their stories -- in their own words -- from covering the presidential election of 2012: . ---------------- . Shawna Shepherd . There are very few jobs where your office is a bus, a plane, a press riser in the back of a campaign event, and your competitors are also colleagues. Campaigns are grueling for candidates, their staff and the journalists who cover them but for all of the advances in technology, nothing replaces seeing a candidate up close day after day interacting with people. One moment came during a town hall where reporters asked Mitt Romney to explain himself on the rope line after the event: . During a town hall in Cleveland earlier, Romney took a question from a woman who, during the course of her remarks, accused President Obama of treason. Romney ultimately ignored that comment. On the rope line after the event, I asked him why he didn't acknowledge that part of her question. He said he doesn't ""correct all the answers that get asked of me"" and added, ""obviously I don't agree that he should be tried."" The Obama campaign promptly responded to the story I filed about the exchange, which I captured on my iPhone, by criticizing Romney for not standing up to ""hateful and over-the-line rhetoric."" ---------------- . Shannon Travis . Something you might've heard: journalists are a bunch of backstabbing, hyper-competitive, coffee-swilling egotists. I can report that the coffee thing is not true. Many of us prefer Diet Coke. Life on the campaign trail also fleshes out another truth: Though political reporters do compete to break and cover news, we often stick together -- like a ""team of rivals"" -- when one or all of us feel set upon.Consider what happened at a February event in Tucson, Arizona: . Reporters, including myself, were covering Rick Santorum. After his speech, we tried to do what we typically do: Film and report on the candidate's interaction with supporters. As we approached, security men roped off a few of us from getting near the candidate. But, I noticed one cable news producer filming directly in front of Santorum and some photojournalists snapping away. ""You can't let some of us near Santorum but tell the rest of us to stay back!"" I snapped at security. ""It's either no press -- or all press!"" My colleagues joined the protest. Ultimately, we only succeeded in raising a stink. But we did succeed in sticking together as one media contingent. It happens a lot. There was the time last November in Des Moines, Iowa, as sexual harassment allegations dogged Herman Cain, that his bodyguard tried to keep a Washington Post reporter at a distance and from asking a question. The bodyguard asked me if I knew the reporter. Not only did I vouch for him, I told the bodyguard I would not play his game of pick-and-choose the reporter. Then there was the time Rick Perry apparently hoped to avoid questions about the U.S. Supreme Court's delay of the execution of a Texas death-row inmate. After his tour of a bottling plant in Atlantic, Iowa, I popped a question on the court's delay. Annoyed, Perry briefly and blandly answered, then moved on. My colleague at NBC News would not have it. He followed up with another question on the subject -- a one-two punch that gave all of us a fuller answer to report. The campaign trail is littered with stories like these: reporters sticking together, working together to file deadlines, even helping each other with broken or missing equipment. I even once put money in a parking meter for a colleague when I noticed his meter time was up. ------------------------- . Rachel Streitfeld . One part of the job is making sure we get enough ""generic"" video of the candidate -- it's called b-roll -- that can be used on TV again and again. I picked up a trick occasionally used by still photographers covering the end of an event, as the candidate is shaking hands with supporters: If you see a cute baby, wait nearby for your moment. This tactic pays off particularly well when covering former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who usually can't resist lifting babies up high in the air. Some of us call ""the Simba lift."" And sure enough, at an event in South Carolina, Romney obliged. Holding a smiling youngster who gripped a Romney sign in her two small fists, he lifted her high up in the air. And CNN got the shot. Another fun moment was when, after hearing Romney talk for months about his friendship with an inspiring Olympic athlete, we finally met the man -- gold-medalist and speed skater Derek Parra. A small, compact speed demon who switched from rollerblading to speed skating, Parra told the traveling press corps stories about his and Romney's friendship. And then he let us try on his Olympic gold medal! ------------------------- . Peter Hamby . In the waning days of the Iowa caucus campaign, I was trailing Texas Gov. Rick Perry around the state as he scraped for a top three finish in hopes of boosting his faltering campaign. A longtime runner who was hobbled by back surgery the previous summer, Perry would often wake early in those frigid December mornings and hit the treadmill in whatever hotel chain the campaign and its traveling press corps were in. I'd sometimes encounter Perry during my own workouts; you'd know he was in the fitness center if a pair of Texas State Troopers was standing guard outside. I watched him every now and then on the treadmill. He liked to watch SportsCenter. He wore Brooks running shoes. I noticed, enviously, that he usually kept a faster pace and ran for longer times than I did. But I also saw that he had more energy on the campaign trail in the final days of the Iowa sprint than he did when he first embarked on his presidential bid in August. His staff knew it, too. He was sharper. He was a better debater. It was because he was jogging pretty much every day, something he was prevented from doing in previous months because he was lethargic and on painkillers. I later spun this morning workout routine of ours into a story about Perry's late burst of energy, and how his campaign might have worked out a little differently had be been in top physical condition during those damaging fall debates. Perry, it turned out, enjoyed the story and our shared interest in running. And after his campaign ended, whenever I saw him at political events around the country he would invite me to go jogging with him Austin.","Every 4 years, journalists join presidential campaign trail .

"(CNN) -- At a critical moment in the newly released action-thriller movie ""Contagion,"" the young disease detective, played by Kate Winslet, is using a dry-erase board to drive home the danger of the new virus that has wiped out thousands of people, including Gwyneth Paltrow. Winslet's character uses a concept known as ""R0"" -- pronounced ""R-naught""--- to explain to skeptical public health officials that the new virus could be much more contagious than influenza or polio. ""I wanted people to understand R0,"" explains Scott Z. Burns, who wrote the film, which was No. 1 at the box office this weekend. Here it is: R0 is the number of new cases that a single infected person will cause, on average. In most seasons, R0 for influenza is just below 2. In the devastating 1918 pandemic, it was likely above 3. With an R0 that high, the number of cases will grow exponentially, unless patients remain isolated or quickly receive effective treatment. ""Kate Winslet did an amazing job with it,"" says Burns. ""That one scene is really a science and math lesson, but people seem to get it."" Advanced math and science aren't usually a part of a big Hollywood thriller, particularly one with ""Contagion's"" cast: not just Winslet and Paltrow but Matt Damon, Jude Law, Laurence Fishburne and Marion Cotillard, along with a cameo by CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta. But Burns and director Steven Soderbergh approached the project in an unusually dedicated way. The germ of the idea was planted in Burns when he saw an online TED talk by Larry Brilliant, who was one of the doctors and scientists who finally eradicated the smallpox virus in the 1970s. By the time he gave the talk in 2006, he was working with Google to try and leverage the reach of the Internet to find early warning signs of a flu pandemic or other outbreak of deadly disease. Burns reached out to Brilliant, who introduced him to Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, a scientist and disease detective at the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University. Lipkin describes himself as an experimental pathologist -- ""I figure out what went wrong."" As a big part of his research, he examines tissue samples from around the world, looking for new and dangerous viruses. He began to hold one-on-one seminars with Burns at his office and his lab at Columbia, which evolved into a major role as a consultant on the film. Lipkin says the science in ""Contagion"" is strong enough that the film could have a long life as a teaching tool for students, politicians and even public health officials. Soon, Burns found himself poring through the daily reports of ProMedMail.com, a sort of listserv for scientists and infectious disease specialists, flagging unusual cases or findings anywhere in the world. ""You'd see three unexplained deaths in Africa, or two people with an unusual virus in India. I'd call Ian, and frequently he'd have been sent blood and tissue, to see what it was,"" Burns recalls. For the right killer for ""Contagion,"" ""I wanted to find a virus that would be especially nefarious in that it wouldn't show up in an unusual way, that could be misinterpreted in an emergency room 5,000 miles away from where a person originally caught it."" Burns and Lipkin eventually focused on a pair of deadly, closely related viruses that primarily live in bats but occasionally infect people: Nipah, found in Southeast Asia, and Hendra, from Australia. With a screenwriter's glee, they genetically modified the fictional virus to let it spread readily through bodily fluids or coughing. Voila! A global killer. By then, Brilliant had left Google to work at the Skoll Global Threats Fund, a foundation created by eBay co-founder Jeff Skoll to conduct research on large-scale dangers, including viruses. Another Skoll venture, Participant Media, founded with a mission to support films with important social messages, agreed to underwrite the development of the script. Ricky Strauss, Participant's president, served as an executive producer of ""Contagion."" Meanwhile, Lipkin was opening more doors to the scientific community, including top officials at the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""Some of these places, they wouldn't have gotten the time of day,"" recalls Lipkin. ""But I said, 'look, this is an important film. I wouldn't put my name on it if I didn't think it was going to be solid."" CDC not only allowed filmmakers to spend a day shooting ""on campus,"" but senior scientists spent a day with Winslet to help her prepare for the role. Winslet's main guide at CDC was Dr. Anne Schuchat, who led the agency's response to the H1N1 pandemic. ""In my discussions, the key thing I wanted to get across was the intensity of these investigations, the focus you give and the 24/7 nature of it,"" says Schuchat. ""You're disconnected from your regular life, and totally immersed in what you're doing."" Schuchat herself spent six weeks in China during the SARS outbreak in 2003, barely speaking to her family back home. As part of its promotional effort, Participant Media also built a multifaced website, showcasing the work of leading virologists and public health experts. One of them is Dr. John Brownstein, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital in Boston, who has worked with Skoll to develop an online tool to flag outbreaks as they happen around the world. Brownstein called it ""a massive challenge"" to break down the science of pandemics into a viewer-friendly message. ""In the absence of a vaccine or a therapeutic (medication), you couldn't come up with three things you could do right now to prevent a pandemic."" He says that people could somewhat slow the spread of a pandemic by taking simple measures like isolating themselves if they fall sick, or properly washing their hands. (Burns, incidentally, says he took away one new hand-washing lesson: Don't forget to wash your thumbs.) Lipkin says the real message of the film is political: Don't slash budgets for disease research and early-warning systems. In 2009, just a few months into development, it seemed as though real-world developments might hijack the film. That's when Burns put the project on hold and watched to see whether his imaginary scenario would be trumped by the real H1N1 virus. He found himself fascinated by the push and pull of officials struggling to answer questions from the public. He says the pressures are much the same for those officials and for journalists. ""It's tricky,"" Burns said. ""You don't want to be the scientist who cried wolf, or the journalist who cried wolf. The thing is, they move so quickly, and if you don't sound the alarm quickly, you're way behind the curve."" In ""Contagion,"" the CDC director, played by Fishburne, sends his own family into isolation, even as he offers a more reassuring take to the public. He's outed by an investigative blogger, played by Jude Law, who wins a mass following with his scoops on the pandemic -- some accurate, some deliberately misleading. Brownstein says he loved the subplot. ""That to me is the most interesting part of the film. They have this knowledge, and people are holding it back. It plays with the idea of false reporting, and the viral nature of the Web and how it can lead to mistrust."" Schuchat says the CDC is trying to move toward more openness. ""The more we focus on transparency, the more credibility we have. We shared what we knew as we knew it, although we also were careful to say it might change -- this might not be the last word on it."" Now that his creation is decimating a world filled with some of Hollywood's biggest stars, Burns pauses when asked whether the project left him reassured or alarmed about our vulnerability to a newly emergent killer virus. ""On the one hand, writing it did freak me out. I wanted to be realistic, and I kept asking these scientists, 'Could this or that scenario really happen?' And they always said, 'Sure, it could happen.' On the other hand, I was reading an article two years ago, and it talked about how human DNA is littered with remnants of our battles with retroviruses. There's something poetic about that. So with people and viruses, when you look at in the longevity of the relationship, there's some comfort.""","Teaching advanced math and science isn't usually part of a big Hollywood thriller .

"(The Frisky) -- Thanksgiving is one of those great holidays that are less about commercialism and more about togetherness (and food, of course). Unfortunately, all that togetherness can be a little stressful for couples -- especially if it includes a hectic travel schedule and/or time with one or both sets of families. So, after the jump, eight tips for surviving the holiday as a couple. 1. If you're hosting Thanksgiving, make sure to share the work load. Whether you're hosting your friends or your families or a combination of both, the key to survival is to help each other with all the tasks at hand. That may mean splitting the duties (one of you cleans while the other one cooks), or working together to get everything on the to-do list done. This is a wonderful opportunity to support one another and work toward a common goal together. Plus, entertaining can be fun -- especially if you do it with someone you love, so enjoy the day and don't get too caught up in the idea of being ""perfect."" 2. If you're traveling, make a joint playlist for the road. Holiday travel is stressful enough and if there's family on the other end of your trip, you're likely feeling even more pressure than usual. So keep things a little lighter by spending an hour or so before your travel day making a joint playlist you can listen to together en route. Choose songs you both love or have special meaning to you as a couple to help you reconnect during your weekend away (or help you think of each other if you have to spend the holiday apart). The Frisky: 10 tips for throwing a family-free, friends-only Thanksgiving . 3. Make time for just the two of you. If you're hosting friends or family or going away for the whole weekend, it's imperative that you squeeze in some solo time with your partner. If you're lucky enough to share a room, retire to bed a little earlier than normal or stay in bed just a little later to relish a few extra moments of alone time. Try to get out for a walk around the neighborhood, or pull your boyfriend away from the rest of the family and show him a childhood photo album. The point is to reconnect at some point during each day so you can check in with one another and you won't feel like strangers when the weekend's over and it's just the two of you again. The Frisky: The American Music Awards: the good, the bad, and the boring . 4. If you're meeting new family, debrief each other on names, relationships, and topics to avoid. Thanksgiving is a time for a lot of new couples to meet each other's extended families for the first time.

"(CNN) -- A federal judge on Friday ordered rapper T.I. back to prison for 11 months for violating his probation with a drug arrest. T.I., whose real name is Clifford Harris, begged U.S. District Judge Charles Pannell Jr. for mercy, saying he needed help for his drug addiction, not more time in prison. ""I screwed up big time and I am sorry,"" Harris said during his probation revocation hearing Friday afternoon. ""I am sincerely sorry. I am scared that you will send me to prison."" ""Mr. Harris has had the limit of second chances,"" Pannell said as he imposed the sentence. His wife, ""Tiny"" Tameka Cottle, left the courtroom in tears even before the judge finished the sentencing. Harris must report to begin his sentence in two weeks, the judge said. U.S. Attorney Sally Yates called for Harris to be sent back to prison for two years, saying ""there has to be a significant consequence for undermining the [plea] agreement"" that Harris received two years ago to resolve federal gun charges. Those charges followed his attempt to buy three machine guns in the parking lot of an Atlanta grocery store. The judge agreed, saying Harris ""dumped a lot of smut over all the experiment,"" referring to his unusual plea agreement that allowed him to avoid a long prison term. Harris served a year of house detention before he spent nine months in prison and three months in a halfway house. The cornerstone of the plea deal was his community service which included the rapper speaking to young people about the importances of staying off drugs and out of trouble. ""He was supposed to be living what he was preaching,"" prosecutor Yates said. Harris, in a prepared statement he read in court, said that he had been ""sincere in my message to kids that guns, gangs and drugs threaten your life and I mean it."" ""I've lived the same life that those kids have,"" he said. ""As I discovered in talking to my probation officer, I had many problems from my childhood. Now I am down to the disease of addiction. I need help. For me, my mother my kids. I need the court to give me mercy. Judge, don't send me back to prison."" Friday's hearing was triggered when Harris was arrested on drug charges after a traffic stop on Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood, California, in September, a violation of the rapper's probation on the weapons conviction. He failed a drug test the day after his arrest, according to his federal probation officer. ""I want drugs out of my life,"" Harris told the court. ""If I can get treatment and counseling I need, I can beat this."" Defense lawyers argued that it is rare for probation to be revoked on a simple drug possession charge. Defense lawyer Ed Garland told the judge that Harris began drinking a mixture of cough syrup and soda during a ""grueling tour schedule"" over the summer, saying the combination ""gave him the same feeling as his old pills, which he then ran out of.""  He had been given painkillers after a dentist performed several root canals, he said. ""He started off the wagon, like an alcoholic,"" Garland said. ""That's what happened to this young man. So he failed his commitment, with drugs that relaxed him in his schedule."" In an interview with CNN's Don Lemon on Thursday, Harris talked about his regrets. ""The only thing that I can say, man, is that all people who have supported me, who were behind me, who believed in me, who were disappointed and were let down, I just offer my sincerest apologies and I will dedicate my life no matter how long it takes to earn your trust back and to make you proud yet again,"" he said. When Lemon asked the rapper if that meant he would ""never again"" get in trouble, he answered, ""Absolutely."" ""I'm tired, I'm wore out,"" he said. ""I don't have the age, the energy, or just the attitude to move forward and continuing in this cycle in this ongoing process of destruction and disparity in my life. I've got too many depending on me and counting on me. I can't do it."" The recording artist made headlines Wednesday for his involvement in helping police persuade a man not to jump off the roof of a high-rise office building in Atlanta. Harris talked to the man about how a person ""can make it through anything,"" Atlanta Police spokesman James Polite said. ""T.I. just happened to be in the right place at the right time,"" Polite said. Harris told Lemon that he went to the scene after he heard on the radio that a man was threatening to jump. ""I believe that I have been put here for a purpose, and I believe that I have an ability to reach people that most people can't reach, that I can turn lives around that other people -- they can't have the same affect,"" he said. ""I think that God placed me here for that purpose."" The man, who was not identified by police, was taken to Atlanta's Grady Memorial Hospital for a psychological evaluation, Polite said. He was not charged with a crime, he said. A police officer appeared in court Friday to tell the judge about the rapper's involvement. CNN's T.J. Holmes contributed to this report.","NEW: The rapper gets 11 months for probation violation .

"Boston (CNN) -- An array of witnesses testified Friday in the 20th day of the federal trial of reputed Boston mob boss James ""Whitey"" Bulger: Former drug dealers, family members of alleged victims and a forensic dentist all took the stand. Some of Friday's most interesting testimony came when former drug dealers detailed the scare tactics they said Bulger used, including extortion and shooting one of their brothers. Bulger is charged in the deaths of 19 people during some two decades when prosecutors say he ran Boston's Irish mob. He also faces charges of extortion, racketeering and money laundering. The rules of the street . Paul Moore testified about the rules of the street when he was dealing drugs in Boston the early 1980s. Zach Hafer, assistant U.S. attorney, asked Moore whose permission he needed to sell drugs in South Boston. ""Jimmy Bulger, Whitey,"" Moore replied. To sell cocaine in South Boston, Moore said that and his partner, Billy Shea, had to pay ""rent,"" a weekly or monthly fee to Bulger and his gang. Rent payments to Bulger's gang were between $3,000 and $5,000. ""If you didn't pay, you'd get hurt,"" explained Moore. Anthony Attardo, another former drug dealer, testified that he didn't pay ""the rent,"" and then failed to pay a $100,000 fine for the missing rent payments. Attardo's brother was shot. ""What happened after he was shot?"" Hafer asked. Attardo replied that Bulger and his long-time associated Kevin Weeks came to his house and said ""you're next."" Attardo said he gave Bulger $80,000 and Bulger told him not to worry about the rest. Families share their outrage in court . In addition to hearing about the crime world's rules for drug dealing, the jury went on to learn about the heartbreaking loss the families of murder victims suffered. Steve Davis, the brother of Debra Davis, became emotional talking about his younger sister, whom he also called his best friend. Davis told the court his sister was dating Steve Flemmi, Bulger's partner. One day, she just didn't come home. ""Did you ever see your sister again?"" Hafer asked. ""Not until yesterday,"" answered Davis in reference to the pictures of her remains that were shown in court. As Davis was getting off the stand, he held a photo of his sister toward Bulger, who would not look up. Davis later told reporters outside the courthouse, ""I wanted recognition from him. He's been sitting with his head down."" Another relative of a victim, Patricia Donahue, spoke about the agonizing wait she endured to find out what had happened to her husband. Donahue told the court that while she was preparing dinner, she heard a TV news announcement of a gangland slaying -- and then she saw a picture of her father-in-law's car, which she knew her husband had been driving. ""I called every single hospital in the Boston."" Michael Donahue, who was not affiliated with any gang, was giving his friend Brian Halloran a ride home from a bar that night. Earlier in the trial, disgraced former FBI agent John Morris had apologized to Donahue's family. Morris said that he leaked information to Bulger that Halloran was about to disclose details of Bulger's gang. After court, Patricia Donahue spoke about testifying in front of Bulger. ""He couldn't look at me. If he can kill people and not look victims in the face, he is a coward."" Forensic dentist identified two bodies . Jurors also heard testimony from forensic dentist, Dr. Kathleen Crowley. She was able to positively identify the remains of two alleged Bulger victims. The specific details of the dental work that helped identify Arthur ""Bucky"" Barrett's remains included a root canal, Crowley explained. Earlier in the week, Bulger's long-time crime associate, Kevin Weeks, testified that he saw Bulger shoot Barrett in the back of his head after Barrett had tried to buy his way out of death. Using the same forensic methods, Crowley was able to determine that a different set of the remains belong to John ""Joey"" McIntyre. Weeks alleged that Bulger killed McIntyre after McIntyre admitted to letting authorities capture drugs that Bulger's gang had intended to sell. So far the prosecution has called 46 witnesses. The prosecution expects to call 20 more witnesses, including Flemmi, and believes it could wrap up in 10 days.

"Washington (CNN) -- A South Korean competitor of DuPont Co. allegedly stole the U.S. chemical company's trade secrets for Kevlar, according to a federal indictment. The six-count indictment unsealed on Thursday in Alexandria, Virginia, alleged that Kolon Industries engaged in a several year effort to steal trade secrets related to the high-strength product used in protective vests, body armor, fiber optic cables and other industrial products. Kolon makes a product called Heracron that competes with Kevlar. Five Kolon employees were charged in the indictment that was returned on August 21 by a grand jury in Richmond but kept sealed until U.S. and Korean authorities could decide how to handle the case. Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer said at a news conference that the Korean government has been fully cooperative, and the process of extraditing the Kolon employees has begun. Officials would not speculate on when the defendants might be turned over for trial. A DuPont plant in Richmond makes Kevlar. Neil MacBride, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said the government will seek at least $225 million from Kolon. The amount approximates Kolon's profits from the sale of Heracron over six years. DuPont's primary competitor in the industry, the Japanese firm Teijin, was also targeted by Kolon for intellectual property theft, the indictment said. Officials say the theft of trade secrets and other intellectual property amounts to hundreds of billions of dollars a year, and negatively impacts the U.S. economy. The charges of conspiracy and stealing trade secrets carry penalties of up to 10 years in prison and fines of $250,000.","Indictment says Kolon Industries stole trade secrets from DuPont and a Japanese firm .

"(CNN) -- Stepping into the New York office of fashion mogul Tory Burch, one can't help but notice the positive energy in the room. Elegant yet cozy, substantial yet relaxed, the space brims with creative spirit. Credit can be given to any number of factors, from the artfully layered furnishings to the welcoming personality of Burch herself. But she is quick to give due recognition. ""I work with a feng shui master,"" she says, seated in an armchair that is positioned, according to said consultant, to yield a particularly auspicious flow of harmonious life forces. Good vibrations have always been central to the Tory Burch brand, whose twist on preppy style makes cheerful use of classic hues and graphic patterns. In the ten years since the label's launch, it has expanded from a single Manhattan boutique into a global empire, with more than 120 outposts—a Milan flagship is next—and collections of clothing, cosmetics, home accessories, and more. This October the company will debut a line of watches as well as release its first book, Tory Burch: In Color (Abrams). Reflecting on this rapid growth, Burch remarks, ""I could never have imagined."" Architectural Digest: Bette Midler's Jaw-Dropping NYC Penthouse . Another constant throughout the brand's history has been Daniel Romualdez, the AD100 architect and designer responsible for the stores' famously ebullient decor. When Burch relocated the firm to its current headquarters, in the city's Flatiron neighborhood, she immediately called upon Romualdez to collaborate on her own suite (comprising an office and waiting area) as well as the company's reception spaces. ""Daniel makes the process so much fun,"" she says. The feeling is decidedly mutual. According to Romualdez, who helped decorate Burch's Manhattan and Hamptons homes, too, ""Tory is a dream. She knows exactly what she wants, but she also lets you run with an idea."" Architectural Digest: Elton John's Beverly Hills Home . In the case of Burch's new work space, what she desired was a setting that stayed true to her brand's retail concepts while adapting its signature look into something personal, almost residential. Certain details are direct references to the boutiques. The oak wall paneling, for instance, is based on woodwork used at the label's Madison Avenue location, while the X-base stools and Louis XVI--style side chairs are variations on those installed at many of the outposts. For the most part, however, the array skews toward unique pieces, with family photos and pedigreed furnishings alongside treasured keepsakes from her travels. Particularly fine are the matching bookshelf and desk—1960s designs by Howard Dilday for Count Rodolfo Crespi's bedroom at Palazzo Odescalchi in Rome. Burch admired the set and snatched it up from antiques dealer Gerald Bland. Architectural Digest: Incredibly Designed Vineyards . ""With Tory, it's about honoring her taste at that moment,"" Romualdez says. ""Her aesthetic is always evolving."" But some elements stay the same. The combination of blue and white is a leitmotif, appearing here in various configurations, from an antique mirror framed in crystal and cobalt-blue glass to the wall-mounted collection of china. ""Porcelain has always been a passion,"" Burch says. ""I was raised around it."" Architectural Digest: Gorgeous Childrens' Rooms . Across the room, another soupçon of Burch's childhood has been given pride of place. Displayed on a brass-and-rattan side table is a vintage edition of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's novella The Little Prince. ""It's been a favorite book of mine since I was little,"" she says, adding, ""there are also such relevant themes for adults—how you treat people, how you shape your outlook on life."" They are lessons Burch applies at her company, making social responsibility part of its mission. In 2009 she established a foundation dedicated to the empowerment of female entrepreneurs, offering mentoring programs, business education, and access to low-cost capital. As the Tory Burch brand continues to advance, its founder's office is graciously equipped to meet all challenges. ""We have so many meetings here, everything from finance to fittings,"" she notes. ""People come in and out all day. This is the hub."" Reprinted with permission of Conde Nast.","Fashion mogul Tory Burch enjoys a harmonious working environment .

"(CNN) -- A Kansas company has recalled more than 14,000 pounds of ground beef due to possible E. coli contamination, federal authorities have announced. The recalled meat, sold in large packages and distributed in numerous states, comes from Creekstone Farms Premium Beef of Arkansas City, Kansas. Some 14,158 pounds of beef, in a handful of varieties, are subject to the recall, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service said Tuesday in a press release. A ""third-party"" inspector -- not Creekstone Farms or the USDA -- determined the presence of E. coli 0157:H7, according to the federal agency. The USDA classifies the recall as ""Class 1,"" having determined ""this is a health hazard situation where there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious, adverse health consequences or death."" The company has not received reports of illnesses tied to consumers eating potentially contaminated products, the press release said. Creekstone Farms' recalled products include: 40-pound cases of ""beef fine grind 81/19"" with 10-pound ""chub"" sub-packages, 40-pound cases of ""beef chuck fine grind 81/19"" with 10-pound ""chub"" sub-packages, 40-pound cases of ""beef sirloin fine grind 91/9"" with 10-pound ""chub"" sub-packages, 40-pound cases of ""beef fine grind 90/10 natural"" with 5-pound ""chub"" subpackages, and 60-pound cases of ""beef fine ground 93/7."" All branded ""EST. 27"" inside the USDA inspection mark, the recalled products were processed on February 22, then shipped to firms in Arizona, California, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Washington for ""further processing and/or distribution."" The beef's final destinations remain unclear since they may have been repackaged into smaller packages for sale to individual consumers and sold under different brand names. Per protocol, the Food Safety and Inspection Service routinely has ""recall effectiveness checks"" to ensure that companies are properly alerting customers about the recall and making sure the products are no longer available to customers, the agency said in its news release. On its website, which has no mention of the recent recall, Creekstone Farms boasts that it ""supplies many of the nation's top grocers and restaurants with quality black angus beef products"". Besides being sold in North America, its products are also exported to Europe, Latin America and Asia. Creekstone is owned by Sun Capital Partners, a large U.S.-based private investment firm that says it has more than 170,000 employees and combined sales greater than $40 billion. It has a large portfolio of companies, including Big 10 Tires, Boston Market, Bruegger's, Friendly's, Hanna Anderson and The Limited. E. coli can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration and, in severe cases, kidney failure. Babies, seniors and people with weak immune systems are most susceptible to the infection.","Creekstone Farms has recalled 14,158 pounds of ground beef, the USDA said .

"(CNN) -- Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is known for bold disagreement, conservative arguments, pointed questions and the occasional crude hand gesture, and still, it's been an intense few months for one of the high court's most polarizing figures, with biting insults hurled in his direction. Last month, Scalia dissented in the U.S. Supreme Court's 5-4 health care ruling, writing that the court undermined values of ""caution, minimalism, and the understanding that the federal government is one of limited powers."" Three days earlier, when the high court mostly rejected Arizona's immigration law, Scalia's minority opinion showed he was ""more than usually outraged,"" CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said. In a solo dissent read from the bench, the 76-year-old dressed down the Obama administration and suggested Arizona wouldn't have entered the union if it had known how the ruling would come down: ""If securing its territory in this fashion is not within the power of Arizona, we should cease referring to it as a sovereign state."" While many call Scalia a brilliant legal mind, his dissent on the court's Arizona immigration decision was accused of being too political, ""more like a right-wing blogger or Fox News pundit,"" according to Politico. The Daily Beast called it ""his churlish and self-aggrandizing and probably unethical tirade."" An opinion in Salon called Scalia an ""increasingly intolerant and intolerable blowhard: a pompous celebrant of his own virtue and rectitude"" -- in short, the headline said, a ""ranting old man."" Liberal Washington Post opinion writer E.J. Dionne Jr. called for Scalia to resign. ""Justice Scalia, by the end of the term, was apoplectic,"" SCOTUSblog publisher Tom Goldstein told NPR this week -- and even that, Goldstein said, might be an understatement. ""Justice Scalia cares so passionately about these issues that he wears his heart on his sleeve and the blood runs through his pen."" It's hardly the first time the justice's words and actions have sparked debate and criticism. He's the longest-serving justice on the court currently, one who opposes abortion, gay rights and affirmative action. He advocates for separation of powers and consistently votes in favor of free speech, even when he doesn't agree with what's said. ""If it were up to me and I were king, I would take scruffy, bearded, sandal-wearing idiots who go around burning the flag and put them in jail,"" Scalia once said of a decision that upheld the right to burn the U.S. flag -- a decision he agreed with. In 2004, he refused to recuse himself from a case involving Dick Cheney, even though he'd gone duck hunting with the vice president when the court was considering an appeal involving Cheney's energy task force. The same year, a U.S. marshal guarding the justice confiscated a reporter's tape recorder and erased comments he made at a Mississippi school. The Justice Department found the marshal had violated the law, and Scalia apologized, but denied the seizure. Sometimes, he need not bother with opening his mouth or picking up his pen: When confronted by a reporter outside a Boston church in 2006, Scalia used a certain Italian hand gesture some call vulgar. ""I don't think he cares,"" Scalia biographer Joan Biskupic told CNN in 2009. ""He's got these intense feelings he's not going to keep in check."" Scalia was born in Trenton, New Jersey, an only child who went on to have nine children of his own with his wife, Maureen McCarthy. ""Nino,"" as friends and family call him, was the lone offspring of two immigrant Italian families and ""the center of their universe,"" said Biskupic, who published ""American Original: The Life and Constitution of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia"" in 2009. But that meant he carried the burden of his extended family's attention and desire for success. He attended Harvard Law School and went on to practice law. He also taught law at the University of Virginia, the University of Chicago, Georgetown and Stanford and work as an assistant attorney general and judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals before Ronald Reagan nominated him to the Supreme Court. ""I found the conflicts in terms of being a product of two different families continue to reveal himself,"" Biskupic said. ""The father was quite cerebral, was a professor, always had his nose in a book, he didn't abide any kind of silliness. And his mother's side was much more flamboyant. You had these contrasting families, and, as I write in the book, he learned to deal with conflict and tension early on in his life, and went on to readily generate it as an adult."" His demeanor on the bench and in writing isn't a facade for the public, Biskupic said. ""He actually is very confrontational behind the scenes, just as he is in public. He's very defiant. But he also can be quite funny, quite casual, generous and decent,"" Biskupic said. ""His best friend on the bench is Justice (Ruth Bader) Ginsburg"" -- a low-key, liberal justice but, like Scalia, a native New Yorker who loves opera. ""He's many things. He's very consistent on the law, but he's a lot of things in terms of his personality,"" she added. Indeed, he has a reputation as a language appreciator and grammar geek, as well as a voracious questioner with fierce opinions about almost everything. Bryan A. Garner, a lawyer who collaborated with Scalia on two books, 2008's ""Making Your Case: The Art of Persuading Judges,"" and ""Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts,"" told The New Yorker they nearly a canceled the second text, released last month, over a disagreement about contractions like ""don't"" and ""can't."" While Garner found them acceptable, Scalia ""finds them 'intellectually abominable, but commercially reasonable.'"" ""Justice Scalia is an intellectual pugilist, throwing some very hard punches,"" Garner told The New Yorker. His colleagues on the bench know his style well. In a 2011 tribute to Scalia's 25 years on the bench, Roberts noted Scalia was nominated in 1986 ""and the place hasn't been the same since.""

"(CNN) -- Do you know how long your cell phone company keeps records of whom you text, who calls you or what places you have traveled? Do you know how often cell phone companies turn over this information to the police and whether they first ask the police to get a warrant based on probable cause? No, you don't. Not unless you work for a cell phone company or a law enforcement agency with a specialty in electronic surveillance. You aren't alone: Congress and the courts have no idea either. The little we do know is worrisome. The companies are not legally required to turn over your information simply because a police officer is curious about you. Yet wireless carriers sell this information to police all the time. As far as the cell phone companies are concerned, the less Americans know about it the better. Whom you text and call and where you go (tracked by your cell phone as long as it's on) can reveal a great deal about you. Your calling patterns can show which friends matter to you the most, and your travel patterns can reveal what political and religious meetings you attend and what doctors you visit. Over time, this data accumulates into a dossier portraying details of your life so intimate that you may not have thought of them yourself. In comparison with companies such as Facebook and Google, which collect, store and use our information in one way or another, cell phone companies are less transparent. U.S. Rep. Edward Markey, co-chairman of the Congressional Bipartisan Privacy Caucus, recently requested that cell phone companies disclose basic statistics on how our personal data is shared with the government. Let's hope the companies are forthcoming -- but don't hold your breath. To be sure, there can be legitimate reasons for law enforcement agents to track individuals' movements. For example, when officers can demonstrate to a judge that they have a good reason to believe that tracking will turn up evidence of a crime. But with a surveillance technique this powerful, the public has a strong interest in understanding how it is used to ensure that it is not abused. While the details of individual investigations can legitimately be kept secret, the public and our elected representatives have a right to know the policies in general so their wisdom can be debated. Cell phone companies have long concealed these facts, and they're fighting vigorously to keep it that way. In California, the cell phone industry recently opposed a bill that would have required companies to tell their customers how often and under what circumstances they turn over location information to the police, complaining that it would be ""unduly burdensome."" What little has come to light so far about the companies' practices does not paint a comforting picture. Addressing a surveillance industry conference in 2009, Sprint's electronic surveillance manager revealed that the company had received so many requests for location data that it set up a website where the police could conveniently access the information from the comfort of their desks. In just a 13-month period, he said, the company had provided law enforcement with 8 million individual location data points. Other than Sprint, we do not have even this type of basic information about the frequency of requests for any of the other cell phone companies. The poorly understood relationship between cell phone companies and police raises grave privacy concerns. Like the companies, law enforcement agencies have a strong incentive to keep what is actually happening a secret, lest the public find out and demand new legal protections. More than 10 years ago, the Justice Department convinced the House of Representatives to abandon legislation that would have required law enforcement agencies to compile similar statistics, arguing that it would turn ""crime fighters into bookkeepers."" The excessive secrecy has frustrated the ability of the American people to have an informed debate on just how much information police should have access to without judicial oversight or having to show probable cause. It has also prevented Congress and the courts from effectively addressing these intrusive surveillance powers. That is not how our system of government is supposed to work. It would not be difficult for the carriers to tell customers how their data is collected, stored and shared. In fact, an internal Justice Department document from 2010, dislodged through a public records request by the American Civil Liberties Union, showed the data retention policies of all major carriers on a single piece of paper. The phone companies have all created detailed handbooks for law enforcement agents describing their policies and prices charged for surveillance assistance, a few dated versions of which have seeped out onto the Internet. If the cell phone companies can provide this information to law enforcement agencies, they can and should provide basic information about their sharing of data with law enforcement to their customers, too. While law enforcement sometimes argues that making members of the public aware that cell phone companies can track them will make it more difficult to catch criminals, it is too late in the day for that argument now that cell phone tracking is a staple of television police procedurals. Why aren't these policies available on the companies' websites? With such information, consumers could vote with their wallets and punish those companies that don't protect privacy. Keeping their customers in the dark about surveillance is better for business, it seems. We pay the cell phone companies to provide us with a service, not keep tabs on us for the government. And yet the companies that now have access to some of our most private information refuse to reveal even the most basic facts about their policies? We deserve better. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Catherine Crump.","A number of cell phone companies are selling users' private information to police .

(UWIRE) -- The state Board of Regents has reopened its investigation into the University of Iowa's handling of an alleged rape by two of its football players. The regents unanimously voted to re-examine how the university handled the accusation during a special meeting on the University of Iowa campus Tuesday. The mother of a woman who reported she had been raped in a Hillcrest dorm room in October 2007 sent letters in November and May to school officials complaining about the school's handling of the case. Those letters -- which President Sally Mason received copies of -- weren't turned over to the regents during the initial investigation, which concluded in June. In that investigation, the regents concluded that university officials had handled the situation correctly. Now that the regents are aware of the letters, however, they want to know more. ""This is a serious breach of trust,"" Regent President David Miles said. ""It undermines the credibility of the university and this board."" School officials say they welcome the second investigation, insisting that the findings will be the same as the earlier probe. The new report will be presented at the next regents' meeting, scheduled for September 18. On July 18, one of the letters from the mother was released. In the four-page letter, which Miles described as heart-wrenching, the mother contended that the university had mishandled her daughter's case. University of Iowa officials have not disputed the letter's contents but insist there was no cover-up. In October 2007, the woman reported she had been assaulted in a Hillcrest dorm by two then-Hawkeye football players, Abe Satterfield and Cedric Everson. The men left the team late last year. After a trip to the hospital, she and her father went to the athletics department with the allegations. According to the letter, she was interviewed by Gary Barta, the Iowa athletics director, head football coach Kirk Ferentz, and Fred Mims, an associate athletics director. The woman claims that she was pressured to keep the case ""informal"" or within the athletics department. The mother wrote that the woman was told a ""formal process"" would be ""long and arduous"" compared with the ""swift"" informal process led by the athletics department. Satterfield and Everson were both charged with second-degree sexual abuse six months after the incident. Satterfield was also charged with third-degree sexual abuse. The first letter was dated November 19, 2007, and was sent to various university officials. Mason said she saw the letter around Thanksgiving. Another letter was sent in May directly to Mason. Neither letter was given to the regents, a move that put into question the manner in which the investigation was handled. The letter sent in May has not been released yet, University of Iowa Spokesman Steve Parrott said. The original reasoning for not handing over the letters, Mason said, was an interpretation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. This act gives parents and students the right to protect their educational records. ""This original thinking ... is just not tenable,"" Mason said, apologizing to the regents. ""There is no excuse for the failure to turn over those letters as part of the [first] investigation."" Mason was informed of the misinterpretation by Marcus Mills, the University of Iowa vice president for Legal Affairs and the school's general counsel, but who initially made the mistake was not disclosed. Mason apologized profusely for the incident to the regents and the family. She declined to comment on whether safety policies were changed after the first letter in November. In the letter, the woman also contends that the woman's father attempted to call Mason on November 5. That phone call was never returned. Tom Evans, investigator and general counsel to the regents, attempted to contact the family after the case surfaced. The family declined to talk with him. Barta, who attended the meeting, said he welcomed the second investigation, and he was confident that the regents would find that his staff had followed the correct steps. ""Again, it has been very challenging to not be able to tell the full story,"" Barta said in a statement issued after the meeting. ""It has been especially trying the past few days as the integrity and character of Kirk Ferentz, President Mason, [and myself] has been publicly challenged.""","Board of Regents reopens investigation of university officials' handling of rape case .

"(CNN) -- It's a condition practically unheard of in the United States and most Western countries. But in a culture where a woman's status and dignity is decided by her ability to provide a husband with multiple children, it can be a fate worse than death. ""Obstetric fistula"" is a mouthful. But to these women, it's much more than just a physical injury. They see themselves as the walking dead, says Dr. Justin Paluku Lussy, head of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at HEAL Africa Hospital in Goma, Democratic Republic of the Congo. An obstetric fistula occurs when a woman withstands days of obstructed labor, when a baby's head is constantly pushing against her pelvic bone during contractions -- preventing blood flow and causing tissue to die. This creates a hole, or a ""fistula,"" between a woman's vagina and her bladder or rectum. Her baby is unlikely to survive. If the mother lives, she is unable to hold her urine and, in some cases, bowel content, Paluku Lussy says. A woman with a fistula, who is perpetually leaking urine and sometimes feces, is often rejected by her husband and shunned by her village because of her foul smell and inability to bear more children. ""These women have so much shame and so much fear. They spend so much money on perfume trying to cover up the smell,"" says Alison Heller, a doctorate student at Washington University in St. Louis who is leading a research study of 50 women in Niger awaiting fistula surgery. The women range in age from 15 to 70. Tanzanian women find hope in corrective surgery . An estimated 20% of Paluku Lussy's fistula patients report feeling ostracized by their communities, and divorce is common, says the doctor, who started his residency in 2001 at HEAL Africa, a 155-bed tertiary hospital with a fistula repair unit. ""People think fistula patients are witches and just have bad luck,"" he says. Although an estimated 2 million women in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa live with untreated obstetric fistula, according to the Fistula Foundation, it's unlikely for these women to meet or hear of anyone else suffering from the same injuries, because of the lack of modern forms of communication and also the women's reluctance to discuss the condition, Heller says. In most cases, a woman with a fistula doesn't know what a fistula is or that it's treatable with surgery. And if she does, she is far from any hospital and doesn't have money for -- or access to -- transportation, let alone the average $450 cost for repair surgery plus postoperative care. One of the youngest in Heller's study, a 15-year-old girl who was married off to her uncle at age 8, spent eight months selling bags of candied peanuts in order to raise enough money to pay for a taxi so she could get to a fistula center. Such concerns are foreign concepts to most Westerners, says Dr. Lewis Wall, a professor of obstetrics and anthropology at Washington University in St. Louis. That's because obstetric fistulas were largely eradicated from the United States by the 20th century, with strides in prenatal care and the use of cesarean section. But pregnancy complications and childbirth are among the leading causes of death and disability for African women, Wall says. Mom's death inspires doctor's life work . Typical West African hospitals do not have the trained staff or resources to identify and treat fistulas, Heller says. ""Habsu,"" one 32-year-old woman in Heller's study, contracted a fistula in her ninth pregnancy and has had three previous surgeries, all of which have failed. During the latest pregnancy, she was in labor for several days at home in a rural village before receiving medical care. Like many African women, she was malnourished and her pelvic bones were too small for a natural birth. After hours of unsuccessful labor and not knowing how to perform a cesarean, the doctors used a scalpel to sever the baby inside the woman's birth passage. Over the next few days, the mother delivered her baby, piece by piece, Heller says. Another West African woman in Heller's study, ""Amina,"" also has a severe fistula but only leaks when she sits down. After the seated interview with Heller, Amina apologized, saying she would leak urine once she stood up. ""It was as if a gallon of water was thrown to the ground,"" Heller says. ""She was so ashamed."" Many Africans -- both educated and uneducated -- believe there is no cure for fistulas, Paluku Lussy says. When he was in medical school at the University of Goma, he says, ""they used to tell us not to even try to fix them."" But, he says, that's not the case. Fistulas can be repaired with delicate surgery, which has a fairly good success rate. However, surgeons must be well-trained in the principles of the operation, and good follow-up care is essential so the surgery won't fail. Patients with more severe fistulas may need multiple surgeries. Too many mothers still dying . Although he is a full-time professor, Wall last year opened the Danja Fistula Center in Niger, a 42-bed hospital specializing in fistula repair surgeries with an operating room, outpatient clinic and hostel facilities for about 100 women. Since opening the fistula center, Wall estimates the facility has taken on 50 fistula cases per month. But it's very difficult to get trained staff to run a fistula hospital, because of the lack of available education in Africa, he says. Fistula centers rely on donations and cannot afford to hire American gynecologic surgeons. But even they aren't ideal candidates for the job -- since they never see fistula in their own country, they have no experience with it, he says. It's best to have the institution run by locals trained specifically in fistula repair surgery and care. Those who want to help should focus on spreading the word -- awareness is key, he says. Thursday is the first International Day to End Obstetric Fistula; the United Nations Population Fund will host a variety of events to raise awareness. That's true for Washington resident Olivia Bowen. She had never heard of obstetric fistula until she read a book featuring a detailed story of an African woman with the condition. Bowen was shocked at how affordable fistula repair surgery is, by Western standards. Bowen started a fundraiser called ""One Week to End Fistulas,"" which raises money for repair surgeries for underprivileged women who otherwise lack access. She asks that participants practice yoga daily for a week and raise enough money for one woman to have fistula repair surgery. ""I'm not a runner. I do yoga. So it's something that just came naturally to me,"" Bowen says. So far, participants have raised about $2,250, or enough to fund five surgeries. Bowen, who is in the process of making the fundraiser a nonprofit organization, says she hopes to help women who have already developed fistula, while the bigger organizations tackle other issues such as poverty, maternal health and human rights. Ultimately, she says, fistula is not just a women's issue; it's a human issue.","African women with obstetric fistula see themselves as the walking dead, doctor says .

"(CNN) -- In Chicago, thousands of public school teachers and support staff represented by the Chicago Teachers Union have walked off their jobs after reaching an impasse in contract talks with the city. Last month, 780 machinists at a Caterpillar Inc. parts plant in Joliet, Illinois, voted to end their three and a half month strike, accepting a six-year contract that contained almost all of the concessions the company demanded. These contemporary disputes hide a dramatic historical fact: The strike has almost disappeared from American life. The numbers are stark. During the 1970s, an average of 289 major work stoppages involving 1,000 or more workers occurred annually in the United States. By the 1990s, that had fallen to about 35 per year. And in 2009, there were no more than five. The decline in strikes cannot be explained solely by declining union membership. According to a study by sociologist Jake Rosenfeld, unionization among private-sector full-time employees fell by 40% between 1984 and 2002. But the drop in total strike frequency was even greater, falling by more than two-thirds. What has happened to the strike, and what does it mean? Since the 1970s, the forces of economic globalization and technological changes have put increasing pressure on employers and employees. Neither of those forces by themselves, however, requires the disappearance of either unions or strikes, as is shown by the example of other industrialized nations such as Canada, Britain, Australia and many European countries. Rather, the most important difference in the U.S. experience has been a profound change in the legal and institutional order governing labor relations and workers' rights. We have essentially gone back to a pre-New Deal era of workplace governance. Before the 1930s, American unions confronted a legal environment that historians have described as ""judicial repression."" During that time, federal courts repeatedly struck down workers' rights to organize and act collectively, making unions themselves all but illegal. In 1935, the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) created a process for legally recognizing union representation and managing private-sector labor conflict. The result was historic democratization of the American workplace and economy. The strike was a crucial part of this system: While the law was intended to reduce industrial strife, it also relied on the right to strike to protect the integrity of the bargaining process. The prospect of economic sanctions served to push both employers and employees to compromise and negotiate their way toward a peaceful agreement. Thus, the right to strike was explicitly protected in the language of the NLRA and affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1960. From the beginning, though, employers gained a crucial advantage. In 1938, the Supreme Court ruled that while workers could not be fired for striking, they could be ""permanently replaced,"" a distinction with little difference in reality. For much of the post-World War II period, employers generally accepted unions in sectors where they were already established. But in 1981, President Ronald Reagan summarily fired the striking federal air traffic controllers. Reagan's actions announced a critical turn in the federal government's attitude toward workers' rights. As a result, employers quickly adopted more aggressive tactics against unions and their strikes. Decades of conservative federal court and NLRB decisions have now turned the law upside down. For example, in 1983 the Supreme Court allowed permanent replacements to sue their employer if they were dismissed in favor of returning strikers, making a negotiated settlement of such strikes much more difficult. In 1989, the court ruled that the federal Railway Labor Act governing transportation unions did not require employers to lay off employees who crossed picket lines in order to reinstate more senior strikers after an economic strike. That case brought a blistering dissent from Justice William Brennan, who found no basis for the court to favor crossover workers ""unless it is perhaps an unarticulated hostility towards strikes."" At the bargaining table, the threat of replacement dovetails with legal rules that give management unilateral power to impose its last offer on declaration of impasse. As labor law scholar Ellen Dannin notes, the NLRB issued a series of decisions under the Reagan administration that lowered the number of bargaining sessions needed to show impasse, reduced the obligation to provide information to the union and gave employers freer rein to seek concessions, including total discretion in wages. These decisions have made it easier for employers to reach impasse and then implement their desired terms and conditions. The previous mechanisms that once encouraged settlement are now reversed: Managers have incentive to reach impasse quickly and terminate bargaining, while unions often must scramble simply to avoid deadlock. Disputes over impasse and implementation have featured in many high-profile labor struggles of recent years, involving Caterpillar, Bridgestone-Firestone, the Detroit News and major league sports. Even profitable employers can make extraordinary demands, and increasingly firms have chosen to lock out their workers and operate with replacements, as the National Football League is doing with its unionized referees. In effect, we have returned to a policy of judicial repression. The government may no longer send in troops, but ruinous legal and financial penalties threaten unions that go beyond tight restrictions on collective action. For some, the disappearance of strikes may seem like a good thing, an end to the disruptions and occasional inconvenience they may cause. But there are more serious consequences to the loss of workers' rights to organize and to strike. The decline of unionization has contributed to the rise of economic inequality in the U.S. over the past several decades. More than that, it also signals a historic de-democratization of the institutions that traditionally served to hold corporations accountable and govern our working life, from the scope of collective bargaining on the job to the protection for workers' rights under the law. ""This is a difficult decision for all of us to make,"" said union President Karen Lewis about the Chicago teachers' call for a strike. Work stoppages involve real sacrifices, not least of all from the striking workers. For the sake of our economic and political future, however, America would be better off if we had more strikes.

"(CNN) -- It started on Facebook, then spread to Twitter. Now Hipstamatic and Instagram-style pictures are everywhere, including the news media. With an app typically costing no more than $1.99, everyone is becoming a news photographer -- creating dramatic, emotive images with subdued tones, vignetted edges and selective focus. Just point your iPhone or Android device, click the shutter button and instantly you're producing something not short of fine art. But every time I see one of these ""news images"" -- subtly altered to resemble images taken on vintage film stock or using expensive lenses and filters -- I feel cheated. And so should you. The app photographer hasn't spent years learning his or her trade, imagining the scene, waiting for the light to fall just right, swapping lenses and switching angles. They haven't spent hours in the dark room, leaning over trays of noxious chemicals until the early hours of the morning. Nor did they have to spend a huge chunk of their income on the latest digital equipment ($5,999 of my hard-earned cash just went on ordering a new Nikon D4) to ensure they stay on top of their game. The app photographer merely has to click a software button and 10 seconds later is rewarded with a masterpiece. CNN Photos: My year on Instagram . The spread of these fake images to the mainstream news media is more worrying. I've recently seen a whole host of Hipstamatic or Instagram pictures in news reports from as far afield as Syria, Egypt and Afghanistan. Why should I worry about the spread of app-doctored news photos? Surely as a news photographer I should welcome the publication of news pictures of any kind, however they are taken. Well no. A news photographer is there to record, not to produce works of art. Any news photographer worth his or her salt will tell you that the best camera is one that lets you take the photo unencumbered by the technicalities of the process. A camera that lets you record the scene with the light and shadows as it lies before you, and to produce an image that brings the emotion of the scene to the viewer -- one that lets you take the photograph naked. Read more: Phone journalism gives a voice to India's rural poor . This is what sets great news photographers apart from the rest of us. In their photos we can see the pain, the suffering, the pity and often the horror. A little of the photographer's emotion will show through in every image. In Haiti, shortly after the 2010 earthquake, I took photos with tears running down my cheeks. It was only the camera held tightly to my face that meant my tears were not visible to those around me. I believe that emotion came through in my pictures. If it didn't I failed in my job. Every time a news organization uses a Hipstamatic or Instagram-style picture in a news report, they are cheating us all. It's not the photographer who has communicated the emotion into the images. It's not the pain, the suffering or the horror that is showing through. It's the work of an app designer in Palo Alto who decided that a nice shallow focus and dark faded border would bring out the best in the image. Over the past few years a number of news photographers have quite rightly been fired for altering images with the help of Photoshop. One added smoke to increase the dramatic appearance of bombing, one cut and pasted a rifle-toting soldier from one image onto another and another removed his own shadow from an image. Hipstamatic, Instagram and other apps produce images that are equally unethical or perhaps even more so. The image never existed in any other place than the eye of the app developer. Since when did we trust app developers to bring us the news? â€¢ Follow @nicksternphoto on Twitter .

"(CNN) -- Watch a movie from acclaimed Japanese animators Studio Ghibli, and you might see a boy turn into a flying dragon, a deer morph into a monstrous god, or a fish transform into a young girl. But with the retirement last year of Hayao Miyazaki, the studio's legendary co-founder, signs suggest the venerable and inimitable company is headed for a transformation of its own. In a Japanese TV interview last Friday, Ghibli co-founder Toshio Suzuki said the firm needed to ""think about its future,"" and would be ""changing the way we make (animation)."" He also speculated that Miyazaki might ""make something again,"" though it might be a no more than a short film for the Studio Ghibli museum. Suzuki's comments followed his own remarks from early last week, when he said Studio Ghibli would take a ""brief break,"" leading to panicked online speculation that the studio was about to close. A Ghibli representative told CNN the speculation was untrue, saying ""Studio Ghibli has decided nothing officially for the future of the studio."" Yet after concluding nearly three decades with Miyazaki at the helm, the fate of the company suddenly looks uncertain. The secret to Ghibli's longevity . The studio has been producing hand-drawn animated films for decades, sticking to old-school, painstaking frame-by-frame methods even as other studios have long embraced computer-aided animation and CGI. Every one of Studio Ghibli's hits -- from ""My Neighbor Totoro"" (1988) to ""The Wind Rises"" (2013) features a signature artistic style -- delicately rendered characters, exquisitely crafted environments, and an effortless sensation of movement. Anime expert Helen McCarthy says Ghibli has been able to perfect its hand-drawn tradition because it has employed the same animators for a very long time -- unlike many other studios, which rely on per-project contracts and short-term piecework. ""This means Ghibli can be sure of a consistent quality of artistry and craftsmanship,"" she said. But as Ghibli's staff ages, the firm must figure out how to carry on with younger talent. McCarthy says the Japanese studio has focused for decades on ""the personal visions of two remarkable directors,"" Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata -- both now in their 70s. ""(Studio Ghibli) is like a great violin, a Stradivarius maybe, in the hands of two great musicians. But when those musicians retire it has to be passed on to new players or else falls silent, because its structure is expensive to maintain."" What's next? The big question: Can anybody succeed Hayao Miyazaki? ""Studio Ghibli has young creators, Goro Miyazaki and Hiromasa Yonebayashi,"" Studio Ghibli's representative told CNN. ""They are continuing to work for the studio."" But the films of Goro Miyazaki, -- Hayao Miyazaki's 47-year-old son -- and Yonebayashi, 41, have yet to achieve anywhere the success of the elder Miyazaki's work. Hayao Miyazaki's 2001 epic, ""Spirited Away,"" grossed a record-breaking $274 million worldwide and took home the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. In 2013, Miyazaki's swansong ""The Wind Rises,"" made over $117 million. By contrast, the studio's newest film, ""When Marnie Was There,"" directed by Yonebayashi, is only expected to make $36 million. Goro Miyazaki's 2013 ""From Up on Poppy Hill"" made about $61 million. That's why the studio must now perform a sober self re-evaluation after enjoying years of steady success. ""We wanted to make a dream company,"" said Suzuki. ""We were able to realize (that dream) to some extent and we're very happy about that. But now we're at a point where we've got to think about what we'll do next."" Should fans be worried? McCarthy says Ghibli's tradition of hand-drawn animation should survive, as long as audiences ""accept the high costs and the demands it places on the workers involved."" ""Art is viable as long as people are willing to make it and buy it."" CNN's Junko Ogura contributed to this report.","Studio Ghibli co-founder: Firm needs to ""think about its future""

"(CNN) -- You can blame that third cup of Joe on your genes. A recent study has found six new genetic variants that could dictate the volume -- and frequency -- of a person's daily coffee consumption. Perfect your coffee pour-over . The research was led by Marilyn Cornelis of the Harvard School of Public Health, and published on Tuesday by the journal Molecular Psychiatry. ""Overall, we have known for a long time that there are some genetic components for our coffee-consuming behaviors,"" Cornelis told CNN. Researchers were able to identify six regions in human DNA that were not previously linked to coffee-drinking behavior, which could explain why one drinker will lie awake at night twitching after one cup while another can gulp down the whole pot before their REM cycle. The study analyzed data from several studies that polled more than 120,000 people on how much coffee they drink a day, then scanned their DNA. 5 hottest new coffee spots in the U.S. Cornelis said researchers will be able to use these genetic variants to study the health effects of coffee -- and caffeine -- better.

AMORY LOVINS, A 40-year plan for energy . Integrating all four energy sectors with new innovations are the key to shifting our reliance on oil, according to physicist Lovins. He believes that the sector costs to the US economy could be reduced by $50 trillion if we can ""eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by 2050 and use one-third less natural gas while switching to efficient use and renewable supply."" DAVID LANG, My underwater robot . TED fellow Lang taught a robot to become an amateur oceanographer, and maintains that the future of underwater discovery lies in our automated friends. Having raised money for his DIY project on Kickstarter, he has high hopes for the creation of a global community of ocean explorers, where thousands of the devices roam the seas. JEFF SPECK, The walkable city . A leader in the fight to eradicate dependence on cars, urban planner Speck slams 'suburban sprawl' - the reorganization of landscape around automobile use.

"(CNN) -- Once upon a time, Ronald Reagan said, ""Thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican."" Today, it's not only socially acceptable to attack your conservative peers, but it has actually become part of campaign strategy.

On Friday, Perry wrote an op-ed for The Washington Post attacking the ""isolationism"" of Paul and the libertarian right. He argued it overlooks the specific threat posed by ISIS in Iraq, a group that is ""well-trained, technologically sophisticated and adept at recruitment, with thousands of people with European passports fighting on its side, as well as some Americans."" More generally, Perry stated that an isolationist stance is naive about national security and quoted St. Ronald Reagan to prove it. He concluded that not only is Paul no Reagan but, even worse, his approach to foreign policy is reminiscent of President Barack Obama's. Of course, all of this is nonsense. Perry vs. Paul: Round two . As Paul wrote for Politico on Monday in reply, he is not an isolationist. He is an anti-interventionist of a nuanced variety, one who has floated the possibility of using airstrikes against ISIS. The comparison with Obama is inappropriate because Paul is not in favor of constantly setting red lines that he later forgets exist when it becomes potentially painful to enforce them. Also, Paul's foreign policy is practically defined by opposition to Obama's big government, security-state operation, so drawing similarities between the two is bizarre. Finally, it is very strange that Perry cites Reagan as an exemplar of interventionism without giving any example of him intervening. At best, there was Grenada in 1983 -- a brief invasion of a Caribbean island where the opposition was a handful of local Marxists (""A lovely little war,"" one correspondent called it). At worst, there was the Iran-Contra, arms-for-hostages scandal (illegal in most people's opinion). Or Lebanon, where a deadly terrorist attack on a Marine Corps barracks eventually led to the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country. On the whole, Reagan was in favor of political confrontation with superpowers or wars by proxy but rarely had the stomach for putting U.S. boots on the ground. His instinctive caution was far closer to Paul's than Perry's ""Remember the Alamo!"" nationalism. But Perry's attack on Paul is obviously tactical. He has noticed that a lot of hawkish Republicans are furious with Paul, so he has decided to leverage himself some media attention and political support by going on the offensive. The strategy is as transparent as the lenses in his new glasses -- presumably a PR guy's bright idea that they might erode memories of him forgetting his lines in the 2012 Republican primaries and convince people that he's smarter than they first thought. Alas, although he now looks like Clark Kent, we've yet to see any evidence that he'll turn into Superman. The debate between these two men is distracting because one senses that neither will be their party's nominee in 2016. Perry because, whatever his accomplishments as a governor, he comes across on the national stage as shallow. Paul because he is too philosophical and can be too easily labeled a maverick libertarian. This is a pity because there's actually plenty of evidence that Paul's libertarianism is far more complex than his father's, as demonstrated by his emergence as a cheerleader for Israel. Nevertheless, he faces months to come of responding to attacks like these. All of which suggests that the Republicans are in danger of forgetting who their real enemy is: the Democratic Party. Fascinating though these intellectual back-and-forths are, they contribute to the impression that the Republicans are cracking up as they obsessively strive for an official conservative ideological purity that they will never actually discover -- because it doesn't exist. Conservatism is traditionally about a spirit or an approach to governing, not a list of commandments that must be defined every four years in an internal party spat that has all the ferocity and counting of angels on a pinhead of a religious war. Rick Perry may believe he is helping himself with this assault on Rand Paul, but is he helping the GOP? Someone should remind him of Reagan's advice on how to treat fellow Republicans.","Timothy Stanley: Rick Perry, Rand Paul spar in op-eds, break Reagan's no-attack rule .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of Kurdish fighters from Turkey have arrived in the Syrian Kurdish town of Ayn al-Arab to join a Kurdish militia group battling to hold off ISIS forces, activists said Saturday. Clashes continue in the area between the militia, called the People's Protection Unit (YPG,) and the ISIS fighters, according the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The latest ISIS advance in Syria has brought a swath of the country's north-central Kurdish region under siege, with Kurdish leaders warning of another humanitarian crisis without international intervention. The Syrian Kurdish town of Ayn al-Arab, or Kobani as it is known to the Kurds, is an island, surrounded by ISIS on three fronts and the Turkish border to the north. The town was already mostly blockaded by ISIS, but in the past several days some 60 nearby villages fell under ISIS control, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. ISIS, which refers to itself as the Islamic State, took 39 villages on Friday alone as Kurdish forces withdrew from their positions, the Observatory said. Mostafa Baly, a Kurdish activist inside Ayn al-Arab, told CNN on Saturday that there had been fierce clashes between ISIS and the YPG 20 kilometers to the east and south of the town, and 25 kilometers to the west. ""The conversation is no longer about withdrawing from this village or taking control of that place. For the People's Protection Unit it is about resisting the attack by ISIS and defending 50,000 Kurds from a massacre,"" he said. Hundred of Kurdish fighters are streaming in from Turkey to join fighters on the front lines and more continue to cross into the city as the minority prepares for what it believes will be an existential battle. ""The Kurdish people do not want to go to the refugee camps. We refuse to live in tents. the only option is to stand strong and defeat ISIS,"" he said. News of the Kurdish fighters flooding to join the defense of Ayn al-Arab came as Turkey's government announced that 49 hostages seized from the Turkish consulate in Mosul, Iraq, had been freed after three months in captivity. Border opening . Fears of a humanitarian crisis in Ayn al-Arab rose this week as displaced people sought refuge there but became trapped between the fighting and the Turkish border. Turkey finally opened its border on Friday, relieving some of the mounting pressure in Ayn al-Arab and allowing refugees to enter its southeastern Sanliurfa province. Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said Saturday that more than 60,000 Kurds fleeing the violence had entered Turkish territories since Friday, according to Turkey's semi-official Anadolu news agency. The refugees entered through eight checkpoints along the border and are being housed in tents, he said. 'Barbaric' attacks . Hosting Syrian refugees is nothing new for Turkey and other neighboring nations. About 815,000 registered Syrian refugees were in Turkey as of last month, part of the 3 million total registered Syrian refugees the U.N. has counted amid Syria's three-year civil war. A further 6.5 million people were believed to be displaced within Syria as of last month, according to the United Nations. Masoud Barzani, President of Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdistan Region, called the ISIS attacks in northern Syria ""barbaric"" and described them as ethnic cleansing. ""I ask the international community to take every measure as soon as possible to save Kobani and the people of Syrian Kurdistan from the terrorists,"" he said in a statement Friday. ""The ISIS terrorists perpetrate crimes and atrocities wherever they are, therefore they have to be hit and defeated wherever they are."" READ MORE: How the ""Islamic State"" is governed .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama says he won't act on immigration reform until after the November congressional elections. The news angered Latino groups pushing him to make good on past promises to halt or substantially reduce deportations of immigrants living illegally in the country. It also prompted criticism from some Democrats, who have called for Obama to act unilaterally in the face of Republican obstruction of immigration legislation. Even Republicans who oppose Obama's intended reforms found a way to attack the President for not doing something they don't want. Here are five reasons why the unfolding Washington drama is all about politics and the upcoming elections: . 1) Waiting until after the November election keeps the focus on the voting . The election is for all 435 House seats and about a third of the Senate, not the White House. Betting money now says Republicans hold their House majority and perhaps gain control of the Senate. By putting off his move until after the election, Obama prevents diverting attention from historically low public approval for Congress. A Washington Post-ABC poll in early August showed that for the first time, a majority of Americans disapproved of their own representatives. An anti-incumbent atmosphere may be the Democrats' only hope for preventing Republicans from holding majorities in both chambers. ""For the Democrats, they want to make this election season about each individual candidate, about their gaffes, about their personalities,"" Manu Raju of Politico told CNN on Sunday. ""They don't want to make this an issue-based election."" Republicans know that, which is why they criticized Obama even though they oppose his planned unilateral moves. ""It's sad, but not surprising, that President Obama continues to play politics with such a serious and important issue, but for this White House politics seems to dictate everything,"" said Republican National Committee spokeswoman Ruth Guerra. 2) It avoids providing further fodder to GOP attack line of imperial Obama . According to reform advocates involved in conversations with the White House, Obama has looked at expanding a program that allows immigrants brought to America illegally as children to avoid deportation. The White House also could protect undocumented immigrants in industries such as farming. Republicans, particularly conservatives, routinely accuse Obama of exceeding the bounds of his powers through executive actions. They consider immigration reforms -- like a Senate-passed bill or the steps Obama contemplates -- to amount to an amnesty for lawbreakers. The GOP-led House already has authorized a lawsuit against Obama for allegedly unconstitutional steps in implementing his signature health care reforms. Proceeding with executive actions now on immigration would strengthen a central conservative campaign issue for November. Democrats saw ""some very scary polling out of some of these red states, particularly among independent voters, where the idea of executive action in particular was not looking good for some of these Democrats who were hanging on for dear life as it is,"" Molly Ball of The Atlantic told CNN on Sunday. 3) Democrats don't have to defend a move made less popular by the child immigrant crisis . Always a volatile political issue, immigration reform became even more inflammatory due to the influx of children from Central America across the Texas border this year. The tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors have overwhelmed U.S. border and immigration services, creating further backlogs in a system already known for long delays and lack of follow-up in processing cases. On June 30, Obama said at the White House he would act on his own on immigration, after GOP House Speaker John Boehner made clear the chamber would not take up a Senate reform bill that passed with bipartisan support. The President said then he expected recommendations from his Cabinet on what steps he could take before the end of summer, and that he intended to ""adopt those recommendations without further delay."" However, the child immigrant influx hardened positions and raised new concerns about lax border controls, causing Obama to change his message in an interview with NBC broadcast Sunday. ""This problem with unaccompanied children that we saw a couple weeks ago -- where you had from Central America a surge of kids who were showing up at the border -- got a lot of attention, and a lot of Americans started thinking, 'We've got this immigration crisis on our hands, '"" Obama said, adding later that ""the truth of the matter is that the politics did shift midsummer because of that problem."" Now, he said, ""I want to spend some time, even as we're getting all our ducks in a row for the executive action, I also want to make sure that the public understands why we're doing this, why it's the right thing for the American people, why it's the right thing for the American economy."" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Monday that Obama ""has not in any way altered his commitment or interest in taking executive action, again, within the confines of the law, to act where Congress hasn't and more specifically, to act where congressional Republicans have blocked congressional action."" ""And the President's commitment to acting on this before the end of the year has not changed,"" Earnest added. 4) It keeps pressure on House Republicans for not voting on the Senate plan . By not acting now, Obama allows his administration and congressional Democrats to keep blaming Republicans for a lack of progress. Every chance he gets, Obama notes how the Senate immigration bill had support from both parties as well as a broad public coalition including business, labor, religious and law enforcement groups backing it, but won't pass because House Republicans oppose it. Earnest said that ""injecting an executive action in the midst of this hyperpartisan, hyperpolitical environment"" shortly before the November election could have ""a negative impact on the broader public support and on the sustainability of immigration reform."" Conservatives respond that the Senate reforms let immigrant lawbreakers off the hook and would increase competition for jobs as the economy continues growing at a slower-than-desired pace. Keeping the focus on the broader immigration debate, rather than specifics of any unilateral steps the President might take, allows congressional Democrats -- especially vulnerable Senate incumbents -- to depict House Republicans as blocking progress. ""You have Democrats now who knew they always had an outside shot, but the President is not putting them under the gun and putting them on the spot,"" Robert Costa of the Washington Post told CNN on Sunday. ""They think they can go to some other issues and have some strengths."" 5) It responds to the political middle more than left-leaning immigrant communities . The news of no executive action on immigration until after the November election angered Latino groups and others, who back reforms and who helped Obama get strong support from Hispanic voters in his two presidential elections. ""When candidate Obama asked our community for support in 2008 and 2012, he urged us all to vote based on our hopes, not our fears,"" said Janet MurguÃ­a, president and CEO of the National Council of La Raza, a leading Hispanic advocacy group. ""Today, President Obama gave in to the fears of Democratic political operatives, crushing the hopes of millions of hard-working people living under the constant threat of deportation and family separation."" Or as CNN contributor Ruben Navarrette put it: ""Some on the left are finally getting the message that Obama is not their amigo."" ""For Obama, the question is never what he can do for the immigration issue, but what the immigration issue can do for him,"" Navarette wrote in an opinion piece published Monday. In this case, Obama decided that angering his traditional political allies made more short-term sense than putting vulnerable Democrats -- especially incumbent Democrats in the Senate -- at greater risk of a backlash against unilateral immigration moves from independent voters who will decide close races in November. CNN chief national correspondent John King noted Sunday that most of the vulnerable Senate Democrats come from states that don't have big Latino populations.

"(CNN) -- We could all learn a few things from Monica Lewinsky, and when you read the essay she penned for Vanity Fair, ""Shame and Survival,"" you undoubtedly will—maybe even about yourself. That is, judging by the excerpts of her article, which the magazine released Tuesday, ahead of publication. Most of the world will be looking for the salacious details of her ""consensual relationship"" with President Clinton. As many will recall, that affair began in 1995 and when news of it broke in 1998, it became a global story. It almost took down the President—he was impeached-- and sent Lewinsky into such an isolated state of hell, she writes, that she had suicidal thoughts at times and a ""fear that I would be literally humiliated to death."" Frankly, when you consider just how intense, relentless and abusive the Lewinsky bullying has been for the past 16 years--by the media, the politicians, the public and trolls on the Internet, it's a wonder she had the psychological stamina to resist those suicidal thoughts. And thank God she did. Lewinsky on Clinton affair: 'Time to burn the beret and bury the blue dress' You can't underplay how huge the news of the Lewinsky-Clinton affair was at a time when the Internet wasn't only used for trolling celebrities; it had such an impact in the public arena that there are people who are still making money off it. The founder of the Drudge Report, Matt Drudge, broke the story of the affair on his then mostly unknown website in 1998; the story put him on the map. In 2014 the site averages more than a billion page views a month. When Barbara Walters interviewed Lewinsky in 1999 on ""20/20,"" a record-breaking 70 million viewers tuned in. While the media pointed fingers at ""that woman,"" it was taking advantage of the hottest story in presidential scandal history and squeezing every dollar it could out of Lewinsky's demise. Heck, when Beyoncé ""dropped"" her album in December 2013, she cashed in as well -- reducing Lewinsky to a line in ""Partition"" as a reference to ejaculation. Lewinsky replied in her essay: ""Thanks, Beyoncé, but if we're verbing, I think you meant 'Bill Clintoned all on my gown.' "" Sexual affairs are happening all over the world at this very moment--with politicians, world leaders, famous actors and people you know personally. Yes, affairs and other indiscretions are disgusting and immoral, but you can hardly be surprised anymore when you hear about them (looking at you Vance McAllister, John Edwards, Anthony Weiner, Donald Sterling). After all, you don't publicly execute people for these everyday offenses between two consenting adults, and yet that's basically what the world did to Lewinsky. Last year, President Clinton was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Obama. In 2014, perhaps the world will give Monica Lewinsky the freedom she finally deserves. The powerful story here isn't the cigar and the blue dress with semen on it, it's that after 16 years of relentless bullying and a past that won't go away, Lewinsky has figured out a way to use the experience to help others by taking ownership of it. Lewinsky writes that she may be the first person ever at the center of an Internet cyberbullying event, and that it was the case of another recent victim of similar bullying, Tyler Clementi, that made her own suffering ""take on a different meaning"". Clintons' relationship with media still testy after all these years . ""Perhaps by sharing my story, I reason, I might be able to help others in their darkest moments of humiliation."" In the same way that a sitting President can sooth a community struck by a hurricane, mudslide or mass shooting, I have no doubt that Lewinsky could help a victim of cyberbullying get through the pain and humiliation -- and be instrumental in encouraging him or her to stay strong. One of the most powerful tools you have in life is the truth, and here's the truth: Regardless of what she says, people will judge. Pundits will pontificate, project and wonder aloud about political motivations in the timing. We will wonder if this will hurt Hillary Clinton in 2016 or if Lewinsky was paid by the RNC to unburden herself like this. Go down that road and you miss something way more powerful than politics -- a lesson in humanity and personal power. She writes that it's time to ""stop tiptoeing around my past—and other people's futures. I am determined to have a different ending to my story. I've decided, finally, to stick my head above the parapet so that I can take back my narrative and give purpose to my past."" By telling her story, she's doing exactly that. It takes remarkable courage to confront your humiliating mistakes and painful past, and still hold your head high. It's in our failures that we often find our strength. Good for you Monica Lewinsky, you found your strength. I for one will be cheering you on.","Mel Robbins: Monica Lewinsky writes in upcoming Vanity Fair about affair with Bill Clinton .

"(CNN) -- Grammy-winning singer Angelique Kidjo joined human rights activists to demand courts martial for troops who publicly gang raped women in the streets of the West African country of Guinea last month. It's part of a strong message against rape that Kidjo, a UNICEF goodwill ambassador, and activist Leymah Gbowee are spreading to the women of Africa, the governments of Africa and the rest of the world. ""I refuse any man to stand here and justify rape to me, because every girl, every woman that is raped is their mother, their grandmother that they are raping, their sister and their daughter,"" Beninese singer Kidjo told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Friday. ""And we cannot sit back -- I can't just accept it, and I'm never going to accept it in my life's breath."" Governments, international and regional groups ""have failed the women of this world,"" said Gbowee, founder and executive director of Women Peace and Security Network Africa. ""They've come up with all of these exotic resolutions, but they lack accountability mechanism, and they're almost like toothless bulldogs,"" she said. "" ... You have what happened in Guinea-Conakry few days ago. No one is compelling that military government to court martial all of those who raped women publicly in the streets."" Guinean soldiers cracked down on pro-democracy protesters a month ago, leaving more than 150 people dead. The United States, the European Union, and the African Union have all imposed sanctions against Guinea's military junta. On Friday, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced the three members who would comprise the international commission to investigate the alleged crackdown and rapes. Separately, in The Hague the International Criminal Court, which tries people accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, has said it would look into the deaths and rapes and determine whether they fall under its jurisdiction. The Guinean government under Capt. Moussa Dadis Camara, who seized power in a bloodless coup in December, said last month that most of the people who died were crushed in the rally. Gbowee, a Liberian, was the focus of the documentary ""Pray the Devil Back to Hell,"" which shows how women confronted then-Liberian President Charles Taylor with a demand for peace to end a bloody 14-year civil war. Led by Gbowee, Liberian women locked arms and refused to let Taylor's representatives out of negotiations in Ghana until they had reached a peace agreement. Ultimately, Taylor resigned from office after a U.N. tribunal charged him with war crimes. He went into hiding for a time but is now on trial. The efforts of the Liberian women ultimately led to the election of Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf as Africa's first female head of state. ""I think definitely this can be repeated,"" Gbowee said of Johnson-Sirleaf's election. ""And one of the things that I'm grateful [to] the documentary for is that it emboldens women in every part. "" ... This documentary is like a landmark or something that tells other women, 'People did it before we came, we've done it, and they can also do it,'"" she said. ""So it's not a fluke. It can happen. People just need to rise up and rise above the politics that so deeply divide us as women."" Women have power but must learn to use it, said Kidjo, who provided music for the documentary. ""The thing is, we women of Africa, we have the power,"" she said. ""We women of the world, we have the power, but we don't know the power we have."" ""... I've been thinking about Israel and Palestine for so many years,"" she said. ""Who's paying the highest price for this? The mothers, crying for their sons dying."" Kidjo said she believed that a strong coalition of women could be a deciding factor. ""We say to both sides, 'Enough is enough. We are tired of war, as you said. We are tired of our children not being safe. Without peace, our children can't go to school, we can't have health care.'"" she said. ""I mean, we women, we have the power. We've got to be absolutely in power."" And that begins with communities, Gbowee said. ""What we need to do and what we've done -- what we did in Liberia was going back into the communities and really just reassuring these women that it's OK to step out with that power,"" she said.","Gbowee: International groups, governments ""have failed the women of this world""

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- A day after the U.S. State Department strongly condemned Israel's plans to build a 1,500-unit settlement in East Jerusalem, Israel announced it would continue a plan to build settlements in other East Jerusalem neighborhoods. On Wednesday, initial approval for a total of up to 3,000 homes in Jerusalem was granted. Read more: Calm elusive as rockets rain in Gaza, Israel . Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a group of foreign ambassadors from Asia-Pacific countries he met with on Wednesday, while overlooking Jerusalem's Old City: ""The walls that you see behind me represent the capital of the Jewish people for 3,000 years. All Israeli governments have built in Jerusalem. We're not going to change that. That's a natural thing."" He went on to say: ""Imagine that you had to limit construction in your own capital; it doesn't make sense."" Read more: Israel's Hamas policy threatens permanent war . The significance of building in East Jerusalem is that Palestinians have long hoped to make it their capital in a future Palestinian state that would include the West Bank and Gaza. In 1967, Israel captured and annexed East Jerusalem, an action never recognized internationally and long condemned by Palestinians as an obstacle to a two-state solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. On Tuesday, Israel announced that settlement building in Ramat Shlomo would continue, a plan originally announced in 2010. Back then, the announcement, which coincided with a visit by Vice President Joe Biden, angered and embarrassed the United States. Read more: After Israel-Gaza: Who won, who lost? At the time, the U.S. had brokered indirect talks between Palestinians and Israel that it hoped would reinvigorate the peace process, but the settlement building announcement prompted the Palestinians to pull out of the talks. There have not been peace talks since. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland used the strongest words against Israeli settlements in recent years after Tuesday's announcement to move the settlement plan forward. ""We are deeply disappointed that Israel insists on continuing this pattern of provocative action. These repeated announcements and plans of new construction run counter to the cause of peace. Israel's leaders continually say that they support a path to a two-state solution, yet these actions only put that goal further at risk,"" she said Tuesday. Read more: Why Israel might hesitate to start a ground invasion . On Wednesday, Israeli Interior Ministry spokesman Efrat Orbach said of the Ramat Shlomo building plan: . ""It is a plan which was passed in the local council (during the visit of U.S. Vice President Joe Biden in March 2010), and two and a half years ago, it was opened to appeals from the public by the regional council. The public's objections were heard this week. As a result of the objections, a number of units were dropped. Now the property developer needs to make the changes to the plan and set out what he is obligated to do according to the plan."" Still, 1,500 new units have been approved. And a day after Nuland's statement, an Israeli planning committee approved more settlement plans. The latest approval is for the Givat Hamatos and Beit Safafa neighborhoods. If that plan goes to the building stages, they would be the first new settlements built in East Jerusalem since 1997. Read more: Why U.S., Israel should welcome Palestinian move at U.N. Palestinian Authority officials are furious and see this as another indication that Israel is not interested in a two-state solution, something Israel denies. ""If there is a financial cliff in Washington or the United States today, there is a political cliff over a two-state solution (here), and I think we are already slipping down the cliff, because the implementation of the massive settlement program that Israel has announced just today and yesterday it is putting an end to the possibility of a two-state solution,"" Mohammad Shtayyeh, a Palestinian Authority negotiator and minister, told CNN on Wednesday. Israel's Jerusalem mayor sees things differently. A statement about Israel's plan to build about 2,600 units in the neighborhoods of Givat Hamatos and Beit Safafa from the mayor's office said: ""Mayor Nir Barkat strongly condemns any attempt to undermine or derail the development plans, which will benefit the Jewish and Arab residents of Jerusalem alike. Not planning and developing Jerusalem neighborhoods ultimately harms all residents and landowners -- Arabs and Jews alike."" Read more: Gaza conflict leaves a 'cruel paradox' for Palestinians . Netanyahu spokesman Mark Regev told CNN: ""The actual construction is of 3,000 housing units, as was decided by the government on November 30, 2012. All these units are in Jerusalem and the settlement blocs that will stay a part of Israel in a future peace agreement. All other announcements regarding construction refer to stages of planning and zoning, a bureaucratic process that takes years to complete. In any case, this process necessitates a separate decision by the government before actual construction can begin."" The United Nations and many countries in the world consider Israeli settlements illegal and an impediment to the peace process. Netanyahu has been pushing more settlement expansion ever since the Palestinian leadership petitioned the United Nations for nonmember state status, which it received on November 29 after the majority of U.N. member nations approved it. In essence, the approval created a degree of statehood for Palestinians, though the change is largely symbolic. The recent settlement approvals do not mean building will commence quickly, but they may heighten tensions between Israel and its Western allies, never mind its Palestinian neighbors who are hoping the international community puts more pressure on Israel over the settlement issue. ""Israel does not understand the language of condemnation; it does not need somebody in a press conference to say we're opposed. Israel needs somebody to link its actions to the economic relations with this or that country. It was (former U.S. Secretary of State) James Baker who stood to say that if Israel continues with the settlement program, we are linking it to loan guarantees that are given to the state of Israel,"" said Shtayyeh, the Palestinian Authority negotiator. This is all happening just as Israel is set to elect its next leaders on January 22.

"(Mental Floss) -- When President Obama commented that the Republicans were standing around drinking Slurpees while the Democrats were busy creating real change in Washington, it caused quite a storm. Now that he's sitting down with the new Republican leadership this week, the so-called ""Slurpee Summit"" is the talk of the nation. While most of us have had one of 7-Eleven's frozen concoctions, there's plenty more you probably don't know about this too cool drink. A Happy Accident . Like so many great inventions, the Slurpee was created by accident. In the late-1950s, Omar Knedlik of Kansas City owned an old Dairy Queen whose machinery was always breaking down. When his soda fountain went out, he improvised by putting some bottles in the freezer to stay cool. However, when he popped the top, they were a little frozen and slushy. Folks loved them and started requesting ""those pops that were in a little bit longer."" Realizing he had a surprise hit on his hands, Knedlik built a machine in the back room using the air conditioning unit from a car that would create slushy soda by combining and freezing a flavor mix, water, and carbon dioxide to make it fizz. He held a ""Name the Product"" contest and the winning entry was ""ICEE."" With help from an engineering and manufacturing company in Dallas, the ICEE machine was redesigned and sold to a few convenience stores throughout the early 1960s. But things really took off when, in 1965, 7-Eleven licensed the machine, but called the drink by a different name to make it unique for their stores. The name Slurpee was coined by Bob Stanford, a 7-Eleven ad agency director, when he described the sound made while sipping it through a straw. Mental Floss: 10 secret menu items at fast food restaurants . Kids Love 'Em . Thanks to inventive advertising aimed at the growing youth market, Slurpees were an instant hit with the Woodstock generation. The cups featured colorful, almost psychedelic designs, and the flavors -- ""Fulla Bulla,"" ""For Adults Only,"" and ""Kiss Me, You Fool"" -- were edgy for the time. 7-Eleven ads were so popular that radio DJs were getting call-in requests for Slurpee commercials. One 1970 campaign featured a full-length song, ""Dance the Slurp,"" written by one of the founding fathers of radio jingles, Tom Merriman. It was released on free, promotional 45 rpm records available in 7-Eleven stores. The catchy little tune was a huge hit at the time and its influence even extended into the late-1990s, when turntablists Cut Chemist and DJ Shadow used the song as the inspiration for their 1999 album, Brainfreeze. Because so few copies of the giveaway album still exist, copies of ""Dance the Slurp"" regularly go for as much as $50 on eBay. In the 1970s, 7-Eleven started selling special cups with images of sports stars, comic book characters, early video games, and even rock bands. The cups kept kids coming back to complete the entire collection. Later, limited edition Slurpee flavors started accompanying the cups to create a complete marketing package. This is a tradition has continued today through promotional tie-ins with video games, professional wrestling, and extreme sports. In recent years, Slurpees have come in annual summer movie cups and flavors. Dating back to 2002, when the tie-in for ""Men In Black II"" was a blackberry drink, the promo cups and flavors have grown more and more elaborate (and popular). The biggest hit so far has been the ""Iron Man"" franchise, with special collector's cups that feature 3-D character designs and a special helmet dome lid. They've been sold on eBay for three times what they originally sold for in the store. However, for ""The Simpson's"" Movie in 2007, they went beyond just redesigned cups and wacky flavors. Select 7-Elevens were converted to look inside and out like Kwik-E-Marts, the 7-Eleven parody on the show, complete with ""Squishees,"" the cartoon world's version of the Slurpee. The tie-in flavor that summer was Woo-Hoo Vanilla Blue, probably one of Homer's favorites. Mental Floss: Sex! Drugs! Racism! 8 controversial candies . The Slurpee Factory . You'd think the last thing Canadians would want is a frozen drink. But since 1999, Winnipeg has been crowned the Slurpee Capital of the World with more than 188,833 Slurpees sold there every month. With a population of just over 675,000 people, that means over a quarter of the population enjoys a Slurpee on a regular basis. The rest of Canada pales in comparison, selling only 179,900 Slurpees every month. Detroit sells the most cups of any U.S. metro area, but the largest single Slurpee-selling store in the U.S. is the one in Kennewick, Washington, which locals have dubbed ""The Slurpee Factory."" Overall, North Americans sip almost 13 million Slurpee drinks every month. And since 1966, close to 6.5 billion Slurpee drinks have been sold, enough to almost fulfill your dreams of buying the world a (frozen) Coke. Happy Birthday to Us . Every year since 2002, on July 11 (that's 7/11, of course), the company celebrates its birthday with ""7-Eleven Day."" Only in this case, the customers get the present -- free 7.11-ounce Slurpees for the first 1,000 people through the door of participating stores. It's estimated that the company gives away over 5,000,000 Slurpees to happy customers on this one day. But Is it Kosher? In case you were wondering, almost all Slurpee flavors are considered kosher pareve (food that is neither meat nor dairy). There are a few, such as Diet Pepsi and the Jolly Rancher mixes, that are considered kosher dairy (due to the chemical tagatose in the artificial sweetener), while others, like the popular Piña Colada drink, are not certified at all. Some 7-Eleven stores get the machines themselves certified kosher, which the store owners use as a selling point for their Jewish customers. Mixology . As any regular Slurpee fan knows, one of the best parts about the self-serve drink is being able to mix flavors from different dispensers. According to Slurpee market research, 41 percent of slurpers never mix their flavors, 37 percent always do, and 21 percent will mix every once in a while. The most popular combinations use the Coke flavor as a base, with a fruity mix on top -- often Wild Cherry or Piña Colada. But of course for the really daring, there's always the ""Suicide Slurpee"" -- mixing a little bit of every flavor from the row of dispensers. No Wonka Required . Some of the wilder Slurpee flavors on tap have been Grapermelon, Darth Dew (a tie-in with Star Wars), Bubble Yum, Banana Cream Pie, Mango Bango, Red Licorice, Purple S-Cream, Slurpurita Pomegranate, and Shrekalicious (a tie-in with Shrek). Most of these and other wild and wacky flavors sound like they could come from a factory run by a guy named Wonka. But in fact, most are the invention of the mad scientists at the Dr Pepper Snapple Labs in Plano, Texas. (Yes, they make Snapple and Dr Pepper flavors, too). Mental Floss: Unusual flavors of 10 familiar treats . To create a new Slurpee flavor requires a savvy combination of science, senses, and marketing. One of their biggest challenges is keeping up on flavor trends, such as knowing that exotic fruits like acai, yumberry, litchi, and dragon fruit are becoming popular with consumers; whereas previously hot flavors, like mango and pomegranate, are now commonplace. Of course just because it's popular doesn't necessarily mean it will taste good. They go through numerous rounds of product testing until they get the flavor just right. But once they've locked down the taste, they have to consider the name, the color, and the consistency of the mix when it's cooled to the standard 28° Fahrenheit. The process can take weeks or even months to go from concept to your corner store. Purple for the People . For the upcoming Slurpee Summit, 7-Eleven has offered to provide symbolic Slurpees -- red for Republican, blue for Democrat, and a new flavor, ""Purple for the People,"" which combines the two colors. So far, their offer has not been accepted, but some in the White House say the drinks could still make an appearance. Regardless, the pending sit-down has been reason enough for 7-Eleven to launch a massive promotional campaign in the form of the Slurpee Unity Tour, a cross-country trek from 7-Eleven's Dallas headquarters to the nation's capital, giving away free samples of their new purple drink to Slurpee fans along the way. This isn't the first time 7-Eleven has gone political. Since the 2000 Presidential election, the company has run a promotion called ""7-Election,"" where customers vote by purchasing special red or blue coffee cups printed with each candidate's name. The cups are scanned at check-out and automatically entered in this unscientific, but surprisingly accurate poll -- in 2000 and 2004, the number of coffee cup votes and the number of actual popular votes for both candidates was only off by 1 or 2 percentage points. While 2008's 7-Elections results were still correct, they gave the election to Obama by a landslide -- 60 percent to 40 percent -- when the margin was really only about 7 percent.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As the Democratic primary race heats up between Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, the delegate estimate between the two remains extremely close. For the first time, Democratic superdelegates may decide their party's nominee. But what exactly is a delegate and why are they so important to Obama and Clinton, and Sen. John McCain and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee on the Republican side? The magic number of delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination is 2,025 out of 4,049 total number of delegates. For Republicans, the number needed is much less -- 1,191 delegates to secure the party's nomination out of 2,380 total delegates. CNN has compiled a list of questions and answers regarding the complicated world of delegates. Q: What's the difference between delegates and superdelegates? A: There are different set of rules for the Democratic  and Republican parties. For Democrats, there are two types of delegates within the Democratic Party: pledged and unpledged. Both of them cast votes for presidential candidates at the national convention, but the methods by which they are selected differ. A pledged delegate is elected to his or her position with the understanding that he or she will support a particular candidate. Over 80 percent of the total delegate votes at the convention are from these pledged delegates. In caucus states, pledged delegates are elected through a series of local-level meetings and conventions and then are allocated to the candidates based on the candidate's showing in the caucuses. In primary states, voters are actually voting for a candidate's slate of pledged delegates. The number of delegates who get to attend the national conventions is proportional to the candidate's share of the primary vote. Although pledged delegates make a ""pledge"" to support a certain candidate, they are not required or bound by the national party to actually support that candidate and may vote any way they choose on the convention floor. So-called ""superdelegates,"" unique to the Democratic party, are drawn from the Democratic National Committee, members of Congress, governors and distinguished party leaders -- like former presidents, vice presidents, and congressional leaders. Some are selected at state conventions. Though sometimes referred to as ""unpledged"" delegates, many superdelegates pledge allegiance to a candidate well before the party convention -- but they are free to change their minds. Superdelegates make up around 20 percent of the total delegates and have only been around since the 1980s. Although the national Republican Party does not have these superdelegates, 123 members of the Republican National Committee are free to vote for any candidate at the GOP convention this summer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Of those, 26 have already expressed support for McCain and three for Huckabee. Republicans, like Democrats, utilize pledged delegates in the nominating process.  A candidate needs 1,911 out of 2,380 total national delegates to secure the nomination. Q: At what point do superdelegates become a factor in deciding who wins the nomination? A: Because Obama and Clinton are neck-and-neck in pledged delegates, the superdelegate number could set a candidate over the top, getting the magic number of delegates needed to win the party's nomination.  Watch superdelegates weigh in on their role in the race » . CNN estimates, however, that Clinton has the support of at least 234 superdelegates compared with at least 156 superdelegates for Obama, according to an ongoing survey. The remaining 400 or so superdelegates either remain neutral, undecided or have not publicly revealed their preferences. Though Clinton appears to hold a sizable lead among these Democratic officials, Obama has scored a series of high-profile superdelegate endorsements in recent weeks, including nods from Sens. Ted Kennedy and John Kerry of Massachusetts. Although there are currently 796 Democratic superdelegates, those numbers may change over the next several months as people die, leave office or leave the Democratic Party.  Watch more about Democratic superdelegates » . The number of superdelegates may also change if states such as Florida and Michigan are ultimately allowed to send delegates. As you may recall, the DNC stripped both states due to the refusal to hold delegate selection contests during the so-called ""window"" of time sanctioned by the DNC. This means that, unless the DNC's current ruling changes, prominent Democrats -- including Florida Sen. Bill Nelson and Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm -- will not be superdelegates. Q: Can superdelegates who've expressed a preference change their mind before that time? A: Yes, superdelegates are not required to indicate a preference for a candidate. Candidates, however, can use their persuasive power to win over superdelegates' support. Q: Have superdelegates ever decided the Democratic nominee? A: No. Since superdelegates were first created in the 1980s, a Democratic nomination race has never come down to the votes of superdelegates at the convention. Usually, the eventual nominee emerges before the convention and the delegates generally have rallied around that nominee at the convention regardless of whom they supported during the primaries. Q: How does CNN determine its delegate count? A: The overall delegate estimate is a combination of our superdelegate estimate and our calculations of how many delegates the candidates won through primaries and caucuses. We add those numbers together and come up with the overall delegate estimate. For the superdelegate count in particular, CNN's ongoing survey involves phone calls and e-mails to delegates as well as public statements of endorsement for a particular candidate.

"Oakland, California (CNN) -- One L. Goh was ordered held without bail Wednesday on charges of seven counts of murder with special circumstances and three counts of attempted murder in the mass shooting this week at Oikos University in Oakland.Goh made his initial court appearance Wednesday before Judge Sandra Bean in Oakland. Goh made his initial court appearance Wednesday before Judge Sandra Bean in Oakland. Bean read the charges aloud in court and explained Goh's rights to him. Wearing a red jail jumpsuit, Goh uttered one word, ""yeah,"" when the judge asked him if One Goh is his name. Goh's next court appearance is April 30. At a news conference Wednesday, District Attorney Nancy E. O'Malley clarified that Goh voluntarily left Oikos last November and wasn't expelled as earlier reported. Oikos is a small college in Oakland that caters primarily to the Korean-American Christian community. Goh, 43, who is Korean-American, was upset because he ""wanted some money back for tuition he had paid, and it is also clear that he focused on one particular administrator at the school who was not present at the school on Monday,"" the day of the shooting, O'Malley told reporters. O'Malley described ""the enormity and devastation of these crimes"" as ""unprecedented in Alameda County."" O'Malley said she would decide on whether to seek the death penalty after his preliminary hearing later this year. ""The information that we have received from some of the individuals who knew him at the school was that he was a loner and what some might call a loser, but he didn't exhibit any behaviors that we're aware that would have alerted anyone to a rampage,"" O'Malley told reporters. Meanwhile, authorities on Wednesday identified the seven people who were killed. The victims, all from California, were: Katleen Ping, 24; Judith Ona Seymour, 53, of San Jose; Lydia H. Sim, 21, of Hayward; Sonam Choedon, 33, of El Cerrito; Grace Eunhea Kim, 23, of Union City; Doris Ifeyinwa Chibuko, 40, of San Leandro; and Tshering Rinzing Bhutia, 38, of San Francisco, according to prosecutors. Ping was killed in the commission of a kidnapping, and Bhutia was killed in connection with the carjacking of his vehicle, O'Malley said. Ping worked in the administration division of the university, and the six other victims were students, O'Malley said. Bhutia also had worked since March 2011 as a housekeeper/food court worker at San Francisco International Airport, the airport's director of community affairs said in a news release. ""He had been working the night shift and had been assigned to maintain and clean the food courts in the various terminals,"" it said. ""Mr. Bhutia had told his immediate supervisor that he had aspirations of moving up to custodial supervisor and that he was attending classes during the day to help him reach that goal."" ""This senseless tragedy has reached across the Bay and directly touched us here at SFO,"" said Airport Director John L. Martin. Goh is also charged with the attempted murder of Dawinder Kaur, 19; Ahmad Javid Sayeed, 36; and Grace Kirika, 43, O'Malley said. Goh allegedly used a .45-caliber gun with four fully loaded magazines of ammunition, O'Malley said. Most of the rounds were fired, said Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan. Jordan also provided new details on how Goh was arrested after he allegedly fled the college in a victim's car. Goh went to a Safeway grocery and asked an employee, if he could use the telephone, Jordan said. During the phone call, it became clear to the employee that something serious had occurred. The employee alerted store security, which in turn alerted Alameda Police, Jordan said. Authorities are investigating whether Goh was phoning a family member, Jordan said. On Monday morning, Goh allegedly walked into the single-story building, took a secretary hostage and went looking for a particular female administrator, Jordan said. Realizing the administrator was not in the classroom where he'd hoped to find her, Goh allegedly shot the secretary and ordered the students to line up against the wall, police said. Not all of them cooperated, Jordan said, and he allegedly began shooting. ""I'm going to kill you all,"" the gunman allegedly said. ""This was a calculated, cold-blooded execution in the classroom,"" the police chief said. The suspect ""just felt a certain urge to inflict pain on them."" The first 911 calls came at 10:33 a.m. ""Shots coming from inside the building, people are running out screaming,"" a dispatcher says in one of the police radio exchanges. After the shootings, the gunman left the classroom, reloaded his semiautomatic weapon and returned, firing into several classrooms, Jordan said. He ended his rampage by driving off in a victim's car, police said. In all, seven people were killed, and three were wounded. The victims were from countries that included Korea, Nepal, Nigeria and the Philippines. ""This happened within minutes,"" Jordan said. ""We don't think the victims had any opportunity to resist, any opportunity to surrender."" Police arrived at the college to find a chaotic scene. ""There's a female bleeding down on the ground, face down on the concrete,"" a dispatcher says in one radio exchange. Inside the building, survivors hid behind locked doors or desks. ""They were just pulling out bodies after bodies,"" said Art Richards, a witness. The suspect was arrested about an hour later when he surrendered to police at the grocery store in the Oakland suburb of Alameda, Jordan said. Goh offered no resistance when arrested, Jordan said, and was ""very cooperative, very matter-of-fact, very calm."" Investigators have determined the gun was obtained legally in California, but they have yet to locate it. Police said Goh was self-conscious about his inability to speak English like a native and felt students and others at the school made fun of him. While Goh appeared close to his family, visiting his parents in senior housing, he struggled with debt, including a tax lien by the Internal Revenue Service, according to court records. CNN affiliate KGO said Goh's brother, a staff sergeant in the Army, died in a car accident while training with the Special Forces. CNN's Sara Weisfeldt, Matt Smith, Alan Duke, Paul Vercammen, Ashley Hayes, Catherine Shoichet and Augie Martin contributed to this report.","District attorney will decide whether to seek death penalty .

"(CNN) -- A Florida man admitted to reporters that he killed his wife and five ""innocent"" children, adding that he wants to be executed ""right away"" so he can be buried with them on Saturday. Mesac Damas spoke with reporters in Haiti, saying a ""spirit"" drove him to kill his wife and children. Mesac Damas, 32, said he wanted to take his own life, but did not have the courage to go through with it, ""because if you kill yourself, you're not going to heaven."" Damas made the statements to a Naples Daily News reporter as he was being led into a Haitian police vehicle in Port-au-Prince. Damas was returned to the United States late Tuesday following his capture in Haiti. Damas faces six counts of premeditated first-degree murder in the deaths of his wife, Guerline Damas, 32; and the couple's five children -- Michzach, 9; Marven, 6; Maven, 5; Megan, 3; and Morgan, 11 months, police have said. The six bodies were found Saturday in the family's North Naples, Florida, home after relatives called police saying they had not been heard from. Asked by the reporter in Haiti why he killed his family, Damas responded, ""Only God knows."" Questioned further, he blamed the crime on his mother-in-law. ""Her mom pretty much made me do it -- the devil, her spirit, whatever she worships,"" he said.  Watch what Damas has to say » . Damas added, ""When I did it, [my] eyes [were] closed but right now my eyes are open."" He repeatedly asked the reporter, ""Do you believe in Jesus Christ,"" and stated, ""The devil exists."" Police said an arrest warrant was issued for Damas on Tuesday ""based on information and evidence collected thus far in the investigation and statements made by Damas to a federal agent after his detention in Haiti."" Police have not said how the five were killed, but Collier County Sheriff Kevin Rambosk described the scene as ""horrific."" The Naples Daily News, citing the warrant, reported that the woman and children were stabbed and their throats were slashed. Damas had used a one-way ticket to fly from Miami to Haiti. Later, he told reporters that he had gone to Haiti to say goodbye to his family. He claimed that he had planned to turn himself in. Police had asked the FBI and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for help in locating Damas. The FBI's legal attaché in the Dominican Republic notified authorities in Collier County, Florida, that a man believed to be Damas was taken into custody Monday by the Haitian National Police. ""Information obtained by [the sheriff's office] shows Damas was found hiding near a hotel in the capital city of Port-au-Prince,"" a sheriff's statement said Tuesday.  Watch In Session's report on Damas' detention in Haiti » . Police earlier said the judge who signed the arrest warrant ordered that Damas be held without bond upon his return to Florida. If convicted of six counts of first-degree murder, Damas could face life in prison or the death penalty. Mesac and Guerline Damas had a history of domestic violence, police said. Mesac Damas was arrested in January, and in June he pleaded no contest to misdemeanor battery charges against his wife. Police said they did not believe he served any jail time, and did not think a restraining order was currently in place regarding the couple. However, an arrest warrant was issued Monday for Damas on charges of violating probation stemming from the January arrest. Guerline Damas' family released a statement Tuesday through the sheriff's office, saying she was ""the best mother, sister and daughter in the world. She was caring and loving, and we miss her very much."" ""This is a family tragedy and we want the community to realize that domestic violence is a serious issue,"" said the statement from the family. ""If you have friends or family who are in an abusive relationship, please try to get them help. And to those women who are being abused, please love yourself enough to get help."" The family said its main concern was getting Damas back into the country ""to face what he has done and get justice for our sister and daughter and her children. ... We ask that you keep our family in your prayers."" The Damases had been married about 10 years, Rambosk said. He did not know how long they had lived in Naples. The six bodies were found about 6:30 p.m. Saturday, a day after police had visited the home to check on the family, Collier County sheriff's Capt. Chris Roberts said. A family member had asked police to conduct a welfare check on the home Friday, saying they had not heard from a resident there, Roberts said. Responding officers knocked on the door and got no answer, he said, but they saw nothing that aroused their suspicions. The following morning, the family member became more concerned and filed a missing persons report, Rambosk said. Later, authorities requested a key to the house from property management, as well as authorization to enter.","NEW: Warrant indicated victims were stabbed, throats slashed, paper reports .

"Edinburgh (CNN) -- In the 20th century, getting your child a toy car meant a trip to a shopping mall. In the 21st century, it can mean going to your computer, downloading a file and creating the toy on your 3-D printer. Only that is not quite revolutionary enough for Massimo Banzi, who spoke at the TED Global conference in Edinburgh, Scotland, in late June. As Banzi pointed out, the 3-D printer a friend of his used to build a toy car was itself an open-source device -- one that could be produced by anyone from freely available plans. The open-source maker movement offers an immense range of possibilities for creativity -- and in some ways, Banzi has been at the center of it. He is part of a team of five people behind ""Arduino,"" a pocket-sized open-source circuit board with a microprocessor that has been used as the brains of thousands of custom devices. Watch Massimo Banzi's TED Talk . For someone who needed to make sure his sick cat got special food not available to his healthy cat, an Arduino motherboard controlled a device, using a converted CD player, that enabled and restricted access to a bowl. For a 14-year-old inventor in Chile, Arduino was a building block in an earthquake monitoring system, connected to a Twitter feed, that provides seismic information; Banzi noted it was completed at least a year ahead of a planned government project with a similar aim. For Matt Richardson, who had grown tired of hearing about overexposed celebrities, Arduino was a key component of a product called ""The Enough Already,"" a system that mutes your television's volume whenever the names Charlie Sheen, Donald Trump, Sarah Palin and Kim Kardashian are mentioned. Arduino played a similar role for the plant monitoring device that tweets ""Water me please,"" the fetal monitoring device that tweets when the soon-to-be baby kicks inside the womb, the mini copter device that can transport items from one village in Africa to another, the network of custom-built radiation detectors deployed by concerned citizens in Japan after the Fukushima disaster, and the device developed at New York University that enables a disabled boy to play a baseball video game. ""You don't need anybody's permission to create something great, says Banzi. ""If you have an idea, you just go and you make it."" TED.com: Boaz Almog levitates a superconductor . The open nature of Banzi's system fit well with the theme of the TED Global conference: ""Radical openness."" TED is a nonprofit organization dedicated to ""Ideas worth spreading."" It holds conferences with high prices -- $6,000 to attend the one in Edinburgh -- but it distributes selected talks free online. Its more than 1,000 talks at www.TED.com have been viewed 800 million times, the organization says. (CNN has a partnership with TED in which it publishes selected talks with additional content.) Over five days, more than 70 speakers and performers explored the varieties of openness and its uses in science, politics, technology, government and the arts. Don Tapscott, a Canadian consultant and author focused on technology and society, began the conference with a talk suggesting that ""the arc of history is a positive one and it's toward openness,"" though he warned that transparency has its risks: If you're going to be naked, ""fitness is no longer optional."" Tapscott: Four principles for the open world . Filmmaker and former Current TV host Jason Silva, who is adept at blending together abstract cultural and philosophical themes, debuted a warp-speed video on the theme of radical openness, ending with a ""Wow"" that made his point that ""awe makes things new again."" NATO Supreme Commander James Stavridis called for open-source security, arguing that in the 21st century, the West isn't going to achieve stability only through the barrel of a gun or by building walls. He stressed the value of reaching out to people through social networks and providing services such as teaching Afghan soldiers to read. Ellen Jorgensen, who created a community ""biolab"" in New York, examined how DIY techniques can open up the world of biology, enabling us to understand ourselves, and our world, better than ever. Labs run by ""biohackers"" can identify invasive species, check your food, analyze your ancestry or pinpoint the dog that's fouling your lawn. Marc Goodman, a law enforcement expert, explored the downside of radical openness, describing how the terrorists in the Mumbai massacre used search engines and other technology to identify and hunt down victims. Criminals can turn the tools of transparency and technology against us, he warned: ""Control the code, control the world."" Beth Noveck, former deputy chief technology officer in the Obama administration, called for an open-source approach to rethinking government, making its operating system as accessible to everyone as the code that powers the Arduino device. And, closing the conference, theorist and teacher Clay Shirky pointed to the promise of open-source approaches to social and political issues. Shirky on TED.com: How cognitive surplus will change the world . Nearly 2 million people around the world use a site called Github to collaborate on software without being part of a formal coordinating structure. Some are now exploring ways to apply the open-source process outside the world of programming, Shirky said. Once you open up the process, it's not easy to shut it down. Shirky mentioned the case of the 9-year-old Scottish girl whose blog describing the lunches being served at her school drew wide attention, prompting a decision by local authorities to order her to stop. What made officials think they could get away with shutting down her blog? Shirky said: ""All of human history up to now."" In the end, the officials relented in the face of widespread criticism and allowed the blog to continue -- a sign that openness is now not just a goal, but a feature of the world we live in.","Open-source movement offers infinite opportunity for invention .

"(CNN) -- As more states pass measures tightening abortion laws, California is making abortions more accessible. Nurse practitioners, certified nurse-midwives and physicians' assistants who complete specified training are now able to perform abortions in California. Gov. Jerry Brown signed the measure into law Wednesday. ""Governor Brown is making a commitment to Californians to continue working to make abortion services a human right and not a privilege in our state, and is also sending a strong message to the rest of the country that attacks on women's health and rights stop in California,"" Laura Jimenez, executive director of California Latinas for Reproductive Justice, said in a statement. ""We are proud that California is the only state in the nation right now that is passing proactive legislation to improve access to abortion, and we hope that this law can further efforts to expand access to women throughout the country."" California Assembly member Toni Atkins, who authored the bill, said the new law reduces obstacles for California women seeking abortions. ""Increasing the number of trained healthcare providers who can perform abortions on a timely basis without requiring significant travel will improve the lives of women and their families in many ways,"" Atkins said in a statement. But critics say they're concerned the new law could undermine women's health. ""This bill is not about helping women, it is specifically designed to trivialize what an abortion is, and its risks,'' said Anissa Smith, spokeswoman for the California ProLife Council. ""Reducing the medical standards for abortion ... defies logic for those who say they care about women."" The Most Rev. Gerald Wilkerson, president of the California Catholic Conference, said even though California makes up 12% of the nation's population, it's also where 29% of abortions take place. ""The often repeated mantra of those supporting abortions rights is that abortions ought to be safe, legal and rare,"" Wilkerson said. ""With this change in California's law, abortions are merely legal -- no longer safe and rare."" Brown also signed six other health-related bills Wednesday, including one that repeals parts of the California Building Standards Code that treat primary clinics differently depending on whether the clinics provide abortion services. Against the grain . California's decision bucks a trend of stiffer abortion laws across the country. Texas passed a new law this year that bans abortions after 20 weeks of gestation; requires abortion clinics to upgrade facilities to become ambulatory surgical centers; tightens usage guidelines for the RU486, the so-called ""abortion pill""; and requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their clinics. Planned Parenthood filed a federal lawsuit last month seeking to overturn parts of the new Texas law -- specifically, the parts about doctors needing hospital admitting privileges, usage controls on RU486 and the upgrades to clinics. In July, North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory signed a law requiring all abortion clinics be held to the same standards as outpatient surgical centers. Also in July, a North Dakota judge delayed the implementation of a new state law that threatened to shut down the state's only abortion clinic by requiring doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles. The North Dakota law also requires those physicians to have ""staff privileges to replace hospital on-staff physicians at that hospital."" CNN's Joe Sutton, Greg Morrison and Nadia Kounang contributed to this report.","In California, some nurses and physicians' assistants can perform abortions .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- No pizza maestro worth his sauce will reveal his secrets. Not even if he's 9 and hoisting up his apron so he doesn't trip on it. ""I'm going to have to know you better,"" Johnny Di Palma says with a smile, as he sprinkles ingredients onto freshly tossed dough. ""And if I tell you, I'll have to kill you."" It's a Wednesday evening and the third-grader is where he usually comes after school -- Antico Pizza, the dream-come-true business established by his father, Giovanni Di Palma. The father/son duo moved from New York two years ago to start a unique pizza place, one that would reflect their family's Italian roots. Four months ago, the restaurant on the west side of Atlanta, Georgia, opened its doors. In the large open kitchen, where patrons crowd to eat over large metal worktables, Johnny is at home. He does his schoolwork -- math is his favorite subject -- in the restaurant office. But otherwise he's working the crowd in his signature newsboy-style hat, tossing and stretching dough (a skill he began developing at age 4) and making grown women swoon. ""He wanted to know if this was my first time here,"" a 32-year-old woman gushes, her hand over her heart. ""Oh, he's so cute."" Asked where he was born, Johnny, sporting a red kerchief around his neck, is quick to say Italy. But his father, standing within earshot, shakes his head and laughs. ""He thinks he was,"" Di Palma, 45, mutters. ""Little Italy,"" in New York, ""is more like it."" Along one wall are the imported mixers and sacks of San Felice flour from Naples, where Giovanni Di Palma's grandparents came from and where the family pizza-making tradition began. On the opposite side of the kitchen are three handcrafted ovens -- weighing in at 30,000 pounds -- that heat up to more than 1,000 degrees and bake a pizza to perfection in 60 seconds. Combining ancient Santa Maria brick with beds of volcanic rock from Mount Vesuvio and Sorrento stone, only seven of these Acunto Napoli ovens exist in the United States, Di Palma says. He has three of them. Propped atop each one is a patron saint, including above the center oven San Gennaro, the patron saint of Naples -- which is also the name of Di Palma's signature pizza, one that includes sweet and spicy peppers from a location he refuses to name -- or rather, confirm. Johnny says they come from Sicily. His father counters with South Africa. Later, one of them says Morocco. The game of guarding a family recipe secret is one the boy knows how to play. If he had his way, Johnny might be hanging out to the sound of Green Day. But the songs that fill the Antico Pizza kitchen include Dean Martin's ""In Napoli,"" Frank Sinatra's ""Isle of Capri"" and Enrico Caruso's ""O Sole Mio."" The maestros at the ovens get especially worked up during Gigi D'Alessio's ""Napule"" -- the song, about a guy making pizza, that's used to pump up the Naples soccer team before games. Wearing a team jersey emblazoned on the back with his nickname ""Giggotto"" (usually shortened to ""Gigi"" or ""Gigo""), Johnny grabs a 12-foot-long wooden paddle and maneuvers one of his pizzas into an oven. ""Maestro, bravo! Gigo!"" his father calls out, while standing beside the woman he recently asked to marry him. Aleesha Hurd was studying to get her MBA at nearby Georgia Institute of Technology when she was introduced to this place. She walked into the under-construction kitchen for an interview, wanting to do some bookkeeping for Di Palma. ""I came in all Tahari-suited up,"" she says, laughing at the memory. ""He asked me, 'You like pizza?' I said, 'No.'"" With that, she says, the interview stopped. Di Palma got to work in front of the ovens, then placed one of his creations before her. ""I ate the whole damn pizza myself,"" she says, shaking her head. She was sold on the business, and even before the engagement she put school on hold to help make Di Palma's dream happen. Telling her father she was dropping out to work at a pizza place didn't go over well at first, she says, but one trip down from his Ohio home and her dad understood. ""I thought I made a pretty mean pizza,"" Albert Hurd said by phone. ""Then I go and see the place. ... I'm watching these people come in. I just couldn't believe how they kept coming. They came until they ran out of dough."" On Saturday nights, Di Palma says, they usually have to lock the door to new customers at around 7:30 p.m. It's not just any pizza, and Johnny knows this, too. He'd like to start a class to teach other kids how to make a proper pizza, and he grimaces and gives a thumbs-down at the mere mention of places like Domino's and Papa John's. But he also munches on prepackaged convenience store beef jerky while strolling past a bin of specialty dried aged beef fit for his father's pizzas, and says of Wendy's, ""They rock!"" He absently grabs a handful of fresh basil and pops it in his mouth as he talks about his favorite movies, ""a lot of blood and gore,"" he says, his eyes lighting up. Later, while making a mask out of dough for a 7-year-old boy who's in the restaurant to celebrate his birthday, Johnny blurts out, ""You ever hear of Jeffrey Dahmer? That's one of the coolest serial killers."" He rattles off his other hobbies -- skateboarding, soccer and his Xbox 360 included -- and boasts of other skills. Tossing mints in the air, he pumps his fist when he catches three in a row. ""My second-best talent is jumping two chairs in a row, the long way,"" he says, minutes before grabbing hold of his flour gun. Yes, Johnny is there in the family restaurant, charming the patrons. But he's also a boy who, frankly, can act like one. Taking -- and wearing -- handfuls of imported flour, he loads his weapon. Bam! He blasts his uncle Giuseppe, visiting from out of town, in the back of the head. Poof! He shoots a boy who's dining with his family point-blank in the face. ""Hey Gigo,"" his father calls out over the crowd and white cloud, ""it might be time to put the gun away."" Leaving the laughing boy customer behind, Johnny saunters off -- maybe to chat up several women who are smiling his way or, if he's feeling it, to create the sort of pizza that would make his ancestors proud.","Boy, 9, has been tossing pie, making pizza and guarding secrets since he was 4 .

"Altinozu, Turkey (CNN) -- Mazen Hajisa has a secret. Amid the olive groves of Turkey just a stone's throw away from the Syrian border, he has hidden away several Styrofoam boxes. Their contents are deadly: a dozen unexploded antipersonnel mines. He took one out and brushed dirt off its green molded plastic case. It was about the size of a soup bowl and stamped with Cyrillic letters. Hajisa pointed at a raised black cross on the top of the device. ""If you put pressure on this trigger,"" he said, ""It will explode."" Hajisa's deadly stash of booby-traps are just a fraction of more than 300 similar devices he claimed he and several other Syrian volunteers dug up from the border between Syria and Turkey over the last two months. Turkish authorities said the Syrian army began planting mine fields along stretches of the border earlier this winter. The landmines appear to be part of an effort to close the widely-traveled smugglers' trails that criss-cross this long Middle Eastern frontier. The new measure has added another potentially lethal obstacle to the already perilous journey that has been made by thousands of Syrian refugees fleeing to Turkey. More than 17,000 Syrians are currently living in Turkish refugee camps, with hundreds of new arrivals coming every day. Rami Bakour knows the new landmine threat all too well. The 25-year old Syrian refugee lay mutilated in a hospital bed in the Turkish city of Antakya. All that was left of his right foot was a stump covered by a bandage. ""I didn't know there were land mines,"" he said, while recalling the fateful afternoon earlier this month, when he tried to flee with his family across the border to Turkey. ""I didn't feel anything under my foot. I didn't feel that I stepped on something. Then I heard a very big explosion,"" Bakour said. ""I didn't know I had been hit until I saw my shoe with my foot inside it laying close to me."" Turkish doctors were scheduled to operate on Bakour's stump once again on Thursday, to clean fragments from his maimed limb. Turkish officials say at least 10 Syrian landmine victims have been treated in Turkish hospitals in recent weeks. ""Any use of antipersonnel landmines is unconscionable,"" wrote the New York-based Human Rights Watch, in a report published earlier this month on new Syrian minefields buried along the borders of both Turkey and Lebanon. An international convention banning the use of antipersonnel mines has been signed by 159 countries. Syria, the United States and Russia are not signatories. Human Rights Watch researchers who examined the landmines retrieved by Hajisa identified them as Russian- or Soviet-made PMN-2 antipersonnel mines. Though the Syrian minefields were new, at least some of the landmines appeared to have been manufactured decades ago during the Cold War. ""The PMN-2 antipersonnel landmine was produced in state factories of the Soviet Union,"" wrote Mark Hiznay, a senior researcher in Human Rights Watch's Arms Division. ""The examples we photographed had stamps on them that indicated the explosives were loaded into the mines in 1982."" According to Human Rights Watch, it was impossible to ascertain when the mines were sold to Syria. But possibly as long as three decades after production, the Soviet landmines were claiming new victims. ""That is the insidious nature of the weapons,"" Hiznay wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""They wait for their victim. It's why 159 countries have banned them."" Typically, de-mining operations in conflict zones are carried out by experts wearing armor and using specialized equipment. But the Syrian activist Hajisa and his colleagues had none of these resources and virtually no training when they began the dangerous work of clearing smugglers' trails. ""Activists informed me that the regime planted mines that exploded under pressure,"" said Hajisa, who had some prior experience working with other models of landmines while doing his mandatory military service in the Syrian army five years ago. ""So I conducted an experiment. I dug in a big stick next to a mine, tied a rope to it, and went 20 meters away from the mine to pull it out. When I saw the mine didn't explode, I discovered that you have to step on it to detonate it."" From that moment, Hajisa said he and several other volunteers started opening up paths through the minefields. His de-mining tool of choice? A foot-long metal kebab skewer. ""The mines are typically buried 5 to 6 centimeters underground,"" he explained, while demonstrating how he probed the dirt with the skewer. ""You can find them because the earth around them is a different color, after the Syrian soldiers buried the mines there."" Asked why he was risking his life digging up hidden explosives, Hajisa had a simple answer. ""It's my duty,"" he said. ""If I don't do this, how will the refugees escape from the regime? They face two choices, either be killed by snipers and tanks, or be killed by landmines. The refugees must have a safe place to escape to."" A crackdown on protesters by the Syrian regime has been going on for more than a year. The United Nations estimates as many as 9,000 people have been killed, while activists put the toll at more than 10,000. The violence has forced thousands from their homes, many of them seeking refuge in Turkey. After showing CNN his boxes full of landmines, Hajisa gingerly carried them back into the underbrush where he had stored them. The volunteer de-miner did not know how to defuse the deadly little devices. He said he didn't know of any official to whom he could turn over the mines, seeming not to trust the Turks. ""I hide them here because I don't know where else to put them,"" he said. Journalist Omar al Muqdad contributed to this report.","Syria began mining its border with Turkey a few months ago, Hajisa says .

"(CNN) -- Melanie Servetas lived the American dream. She had a six-figure salary as an executive with Wells Fargo, a Jaguar and a three-bedroom house in sunny Southern California. But then, she fell in love. She met someone from Brazil on an online dating service. They chatted over the Internet and by phone for five months and decided they wanted to be together. That's where this simple love story gets very complicated. Servetas' partner is a woman, Claudia Amaral. If she were a man, the two could get married and Servetas could apply for her spouse to be admitted to the United States and eventually gain permanent residency. But current immigration law does not allow a U.S. citizen in a same-sex relationship to sponsor his or her spouse or partner. There are nearly 30,000 such couples in America who now find themselves in the crosshairs of two critical national debates: the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA, and immigration reform. One of those debates could be settled Wednesday. The Supreme Court is poised to hand down decisions on two gay marriage cases Wednesday, the last day of the court's term. One involves the constitutionality of Proposition 8, a California referendum that banned same-sex marriage. The other is DOMA. If Prop 8 is struck down, Servetas could marry Amaral in her home state just like she could in the District of Columbia or one of the 12 other states that allow gay marriage. But that marriage would be invisible as far as immigration law is concerned. Servetas could not sponsor her wife because of DOMA, which prohibits the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages. So Servetas, 48, gave up her life in the United States and moved to Brazil, where she launched an information technology company. The company is struggling and Servetas misses everything about America. But she cannot imagine a life without Amaral. ""Our life is surrounded by uncertainty. We live in limbo all the time,"" she said, not knowing if one day her work visa in Brazil might not be extended. She goes to sleep every night worrying that tomorrow, she may be separated from the woman she loves. If the justices strike down DOMA, bi-national gay couples will gain the same immigration rights as heterosexual married couples. At the same time, Patrick Leahy, a Democratic senator from Vermont, has filed an amendment to an immigration reform bill in the Senate that would afford gay couples equality in immigration sponsorship. Steve Ralls, spokesman for Immigration Equality, an organization that has been working on this issue for two decades, said for the first time, the LGBT community is optimistic that immigration policy will become less discriminatory. ""As of today, we are stuck in a race to see who's going to solve the problem first,"" Ralls said. ""If the Senate bill is about to receive its final vote and either we do not have a court ruling or we have a bad court ruling, then (Leahy's) amendment becomes absolutely critical for binational couples."" Gay rights plan clouds immigration reform prospects . The amendment, however, doesn't sit well with conservatives and even with more liberal lawmakers who believe it could potentially derail the entire immigration reform bill. The chances of Leahy's amendment passing, say immigration activists, are slim to none. In any case, if the Supreme Court strikes down DOMA, the immigration amendment would be moot. ""I can't sleep thinking about all this,"" Servetas said from her residence in Rio de Janeiro. A bill to recognize same-sex partners for immigration purposes was first introduced in Congress in 2000. Since then countless couples have been separated or have had to make the same difficult decision as Servetas and leave home. In Atlanta, Nepal native Satyam Barakoti, 36, has grown resolute in her efforts to establish a normal life, despite the dark immigration cloud that hangs over her. She and her partner, Tonja Holder, have been together five years and run a nonprofit consulting agency. They bought a house, and Barakoti is halfway through her first pregnancy. (More than 17,000 children in this country are being raised by binational couples.) Holder and Barakoti have picked out names: Kabir if it's a boy and Annapurna for a girl. But come February, Barakoti's temporary work visa, known as an H-1B, will expire, and she could very likely have to leave America. Holder cannot sponsor her for permanent residency or what's more commonly called a green card. Barakoti's child will be born a U.S. citizen, but under current law, children cannot sponsor parents until they are 21. ""We're kind of waiting to see what happens in the Supreme Court. Our options are very murky,"" Barakoti said. They could move to Nepal, but it will be difficult there for Holder. She's 47, settled in Atlanta and doesn't speak Nepali. The two have discussed moving elsewhere, maybe to immigration-friendly Canada. Mercer University law professor Scott Titshaw, who practiced immigration law for 12 years, described ""love-exiled"" cases as one of the few instances in which he has given this advice: Go north. ""Marriage is just so important to U.S. immigration law,"" Titshaw said. Opinion: Gay rights, immigration reform on collision course . Canada is the top destination for same-sex binational couples in the United States because of proximity and its immigration system. Canada uses a point system to determine who will be allowed in to live and work. Applicants are awarded points for proficiency in education, job experience and language skills. If one partner qualifies for immigration status in Canada, he or she can sponsor the other. Shehan Welihindha, 31, of Sri Lanka and his spouse, Ryan Wilson, 29, live in South Carolina, a state that bans same-sex marriage. They were among the first seven couples to get married in Maryland -- Wilson grew up in Baltimore -- on New Year's Day after that state approved same-sex marriage last fall. But now, with an expiration date on Welihindha's student visa, they're considering Canada. Welihindha watched his brother marry an American woman and become a citizen. His younger sister married an American man and within a very short time, she received her green card. But when Welihindha's visa expires, he will either have to find a job with a company that might sponsor him or leave. ""When we think about graduation or starting a family, it takes us back to that root conversation about immigration,"" said Welihindha from his home in Columbia, South Carolina. In all, 31 countries recognize same-sex relationships for immigration purposes. Some, like Great Britain, don't have legalized same-sex marriage but still recognize same-sex couples. That's why Brandon Perlberg, 35, abandoned his law career in New York and moved to London to be with his partner, Benn Storey. Even though the state of New York approved same-sex marriage in 2011, a wedding was not going to help when Storey's temporary work visa ran out. ""You don't get more committed than giving up your country,"" Perlberg said. ""That's the value DOMA was supposed to be protecting. Isn't marriage all about the sanctity of commitment?"" Perlberg is angry -- not at his partner but at his country -- for having to give up everything he cherished and begin again in a foreign land. Psychology professor Nadine Nakamura is researching people like Perlberg and the emotional toll of having to live in exile for the sake of preserving a relationship. ""The whole situation of not knowing what the future holds and kind of having to wait with bated breath to see what politicians or the Supreme Court decides creates a great deal of anxiety,"" said Nakamura, who teaches at the University of La Verne in southern California. ""A lot of same-sex binational couples have a hard time trying to figure out what their future looks like."" Barakoti said she has lived with that anxiety since she arrived in the United States in 2001, constantly filing paperwork for visa applications including an employer-based green card sponsorship that was rejected. It became so all-consuming that she decided not to fret about it anymore. She and Holder are bracing for a high court decision that will not be in their favor. ""Whatever they throw at us, we'll manage,"" Holder said. They know one thing: No matter what, they will find a way to be together. But no one, they said, should have to choose between love and country. Follow Moni Basu on Twitter .","The Supreme Court is poised to hand down a ruling on same-sex marriage .

"(CNN) -- Working in public health for 14 years in Brownsville, Texas, in a border region with poor health conditions, has taught me a lot about how disease threats can get a boost from an unsuspected source. For tuberculosis, this unsuspected source is now diabetes. Tuberculosis is common globally but mistakenly thought of as something that does not affect the United States. It is an airborne, bacterial infection, easily spread by coughing, and it can be fatal. It often lies dormant in the body for many years, and most of the 11 million people in the United States who have the infection are not even aware of it. The only vaccine has limited effectiveness and is not given in the United States. TB continues to have a serious impact in America, with nearly 9,600 cases in 2013, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is not only an issue on the U.S. border with Mexico; rather, it is found in every state, with a particular impact in Florida, Texas, California and New York. Drug-resistant varieties pose an alarming threat since the required treatment is so lengthy and often toxic. Today, the biggest risk for tuberculosis is not HIV/AIDS, which led to a surge in cases in the late 1980s, but diabetes. Diabetes impairs the immune system and leaves a person who has been exposed to TB much more likely to develop active disease. Fast facts on tuberculosis . This is precisely what we saw when we started to investigate TB in communities on the border with Mexico. The alarm has spread to California and the Pacific Northwest, where 20% to 30% of TB cases can be traced to diabetes. TB experts in Florida are also concerned about this phenomenon. Is this on the radar of health providers treating diabetes patients in the United States? Unfortunately, few are aware of the risk of TB or are looking for it. They are also unaware that the course of TB disease is frequently more severe in patients with diabetes, who do not tolerate TB drugs well. Diabetes patients often have difficulty completing treatment, take longer to be cured and are more likely to relapse, even die, and develop drug-resistant TB. TB physicians in Texas are acutely aware of the problem. One told me about a woman with severe diabetes in her 30s. When exposed to TB, she quickly developed active disease. Despite the best efforts of the medical staff, she was not able to absorb the TB medication due to nausea and vomiting. As a result, her TB became drug-resistant, and she had to undergo a rigorous, two-year ordeal of treatment. Five of her children also became infected, and two had to be treated for active disease. She was cured and survived, but this is not always the case. The dimensions of the problem are truly staggering. Diabetes is an exploding global epidemic, much larger than HIV/AIDS. In India, diabetes has nearly doubled the number of cases of TB. Today, 26 million of the 382 million people with diabetes live in the United States. By 2035, nearly 600 million people in the world will have diabetes, and by 2050 so will a third of all Americans, according to the International Diabetes Federation and the CDC. Ignoring this new threat could result in a reversal of the decline in TB experienced over recent years. Diabetes took my teeth but not my life . So what do we need to do? We must educate health care providers, patients and communities. All TB patients should be screened for diabetes. Diabetes caregivers and their patients need to be aware of the risk of TB, and patients born in or traveling to neighborhoods or countries where TB is common should be screened. If TB is found, these patients need treatment, along with the support they need to get through the many months of daily medication. We also need strong investment in research and development of TB vaccines, rapid and inexpensive diagnostic methods for both TB and diabetes, and fast-acting, easy-to-take TB medication. Research largely depends on government funding since the pharmaceutical industry shows little interest in TB. Congress has not made TB a priority despite the increasing risk to the public at large. We all know someone with diabetes. Diabetes could reverse the achievements of several decades in TB control, but, if we combine good science, adequate funding and above all, political will, we can get ahead of this looming crisis. We responded slowly to the combined AIDS/TB threat in the 1980s. We need to react faster to the diabetes/TB threat today. Diabetes continues to spread around the world . The opinions expressed are solely those of Dr. Susan Fisher-Hoch.","Nearly 9,600 cases of tuberculosis were reported in the U.S. in 2013 .

"(CNN) -- I'm sitting in a tiny Russian apartment, like so many others I've visited, talking to two parents who sound just like any other happy couple. They tell me about the first time they met: ""We were madly drawn to each other. And I couldn't even imagine we wouldn't be together."" They describe their hopes for the future: ""As soon as we're on our feet financially, then we plan to have a second child."" But this is not like most other families. Both parents are women who were both previously married to men. Their daughter is in another room playing a computer game. The women don't want her to hear the rest of our conversation. She's too young to understand her parents' fears or why they live in secrecy and have asked us not to publish their names. What's it like to live as a gay family in Russia today? ""To be silent. That's it,"" one of the women replies. ""To hide. Not to show, to give basis for rumors in the office. To be respected at work you have to keep silent,"" her partner adds. It's always been tough to live as a gay person in this country. During the Soviet era gay sex was a crime and the majority of Russians remain deeply conservative on gay issues. It's become even harder since parliament passed what's known as the gay propaganda law in June of last year. The legislation makes it illegal to tell children about gay equality. READ MORE: What one gay performer thinks of Russia's law . The law has been widely criticized by Western leaders who have called it archaic and discriminatory. Human rights activists say it proves Russia is unworthy of hosting the 2014 Winter Olympics, which get under way in Sochi in early February. But that hasn't stopped the political campaign for another law that would repress gay rights even further. In 2013 lawmaker Alexei Zhuravlyov proposed a new law that would strip gay people with children of their parenting rights. The bill triggered fears the government was about to start taking children from their parents, but stalled in Russia's parliament. Zhuravlyov is now pushing for a slightly watered down version that would deny custody to any parent who leaves a straight relationship to be gay. He says: ""In case any parent openly propagates homosexuality and only in this case, if the family splits, a child should exclusively stay with a parent who has heterosexual way of life."" Zhuravlyov dismisses Western liberalism and says traditional Russian values dictate a child should have a father and a mother. ""We think on this, Russia is on the right path compared to the west,"" he says. ""If you in the west are so tolerant, let Russia live with its established traditions. Be tolerant to us."" Activists say such a law would be another backward step and fear its implementation could gather momentum after the Sochi games when the world's focus has shifted away from Russia. Tanya Lokshina from Human Rights Watch says the existing gay propaganda law already has the potential to criminalize gay parents. ""If you're gay and together with your partner ... you tell your child that your family is just the same, no worse and no better than another family next door, a heterosexual family, than you'll be violating the law,"" Lokshina says. Back in the tiny apartment, two parents who love their daughter -- and who describe themselves as patriots and Orthodox Christians -- say they struggle to imagine a day when the government could take their child from them. ""I don't understand how it can be,"" one says. ""I hope it won't happen. Otherwise we'll have to migrate and many people will make that decision to leave Russia."" These parents feel increasingly pushed into the shadows of Russian society, but the couple says they and other gay parents they know are still raising their children with the goal of making their country a better place. ""As a rule, children in gay families are surrounded by care, attention and respect,"" one of the women tells me. ""I don't know what kind of people they'll be in the future, but they're the children in who the most is being invested.""","Russia's ""gay propaganda"" law is forcing gay community into shadows .

"(CNN) -- Emil and Leslie Congdon have just one goal, really: Run the best bag company in the world. It might sound like a stretch for a company of three people operating out of a 1,300-square-foot workshop in Nashville. But Emil Congdon, a self-trained leather craftsman and unabashed perfectionist, doesn't see the point in striving for anything less. ""There are a lot of people making stuff; you have to be unique and offer something different. You just have to make it better,"" said the 33-year-old father of three, who runs the company, Emil Erwin, with his wife, Leslie. ""The world doesn't need another widget; it needs a better widget."" It's a philosophy that seems to be working so far for Emil Erwin, which is named after Congdon's hometown of Erwin in mountainous eastern Tennessee. In less than four years, Emil Erwin's handmade bags and accessories have drawn the attention of major retailers and customers worldwide, proving a small operation can make a big splash. But, as Emil Erwin branches into new territory with women's handbags and clutches, the Congdons are playing it safe when it comes to growing their company -- part of the reason they have only one employee who helps create their products. ""I want to grow, but I'm not going to grow for the sake of growth,"" Emil Congdon said. ""I want to make some money, but I have the long view and I want to make sure we're doing it right."" Shopping made in America . From their workshop in Nashville's Marathon Village, the Congdons work constantly to fulfill orders. It's been that way since 2010, Congdon said, when lifestyle magazine Garden & Gun's ""Made in the South"" awards recognized Emil Erwin's ""elegantly simple"" bags made by hand from rich, heavy leather and waxed canvas. Congdon's smartphone began ringing with orders, prompting him to disable the notification alert. To keep up, he decided to quit his day job as a computer salesman for Dell. ""We couldn't justify taking orders unless we had a long-term plan for fulfilling them,"" Leslie Congdon said. ""It hasn't stopped since then."" 'It's not for everybody' Emil Congdon's fascination with leather-working began in a shoe and saddle repair store in his Appalachian hometown. In college, he taught himself to sew by mending his own clothes and discovered that he enjoyed it. When he couldn't afford a leather tote bag, he made his own. It was far from a masterpiece, he recalls, but he was hooked and hell-bent on mastering the process. Making bags and wallets on nights and weekends sustained him through a handful of unfulfilling jobs -- automotive restoration, unloading boxes, customizing tour buses for musical acts -- that enabled him to support his growing family. He began selling his handiwork at craft shows around Nashville and throughout the region, catching the attention of Matt and Carrie Eddmenson, the couple behind American denim company Imogene + Willie.

They have yet to clear the wait list, Congdon says. By 2012, Congdon was ready to move his workshop out of the family garage and into a workspace in Nashville's Marathon Village. He shared the space for about a year with another budding Nashville designer, men's accessories maker Otis James. By 2013, both businesses had grown to the point that they needed their own workshops. Standards over growth . Despite the growth, the Congdons don't measure success by the number of wallets and belts they sell. To them, being the best means making a distinct product that meets their standards. It's part of the reason they haven't hired more people, he said. Congdon makes each bag to order by hand, a craft he said requires a certain amount of raw talent. ""It's not for everybody -- or maybe I'm not for everybody,"" he said, laughing. ""You can't just want to do it and make it happen, not to the level that I expect or our customers expect."" Otherwise, Emil Erwin is growing and changing in other ways. The Congdons just launched a line of women's handbags and clutches in a design collaboration. The company recently stopped doing wholesale and started selling exclusively through their website. It might sound counterintuitive for a company trying to expand, but it allows them to bring down the cost of their products and interact directly with customers, Congdon said. ""That's the joy of being a small business. We can do whatever we want as long as it makes sense for us and it's fair for our customers,"" he said. Besides, he didn't start a family business to get rich, he said. He did it because he loves working with his hands and having something to show for his efforts.

"(CNN) -- Singer George Hamilton IV, known as the ""International Ambassador of Country Music,"" has died at a Nashville hospital following a heart attack, the Grand Ole Opry said in a press release. He was 77. Hamilton's biggest hit was ""Abilene,"" which reached No. 1 on the country charts in 1963 and returned him to the pop charts, the Opry said. His other country hits were ""Before This Day Ends,"" ""Three Steps to the Phone"" and ""If You Don't Know, I Ain't Gonna Tell You."" Hamilton performed around the world and became the first American country singer to appear in the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia and was the first to record a studio album in Eastern Europe, the Grand Ole Opry said. He performed extensively in Canada and recorded songs by Canadian songwriters such as Joni Mitchell and Gordon Lightfoot. Hamilton started out as a pop singer and had a million-selling hit ""A Rose and a Baby Ruth"" in 1956 before switching to country. He'd been a member of the Grand Ole Opry since 1960. The singer was not related to actor George Hamilton. The North Carolina native died Wednesday Saint Thomas Midtown Hospital in Nashville. Funeral arrangements have not been announced.

"Kentucky (CNN) -- The Kentucky Derby is, without a doubt, America's most iconic horse racing event. England has Royal Ascot, and Australians flock to the Melbourne Cup, but few meetings capture the spirit of a nation quite like the ""Run for the Roses."" So named for the garland of roses that is draped over the winner, the Kentucky Derby traces its rich history back to 1875 when Colonel Meriwether Lewis Clark Junior decided to inaugurate a race in his home state of Kentucky. Clark -- grandson of William Clark of the historic 19th century Lewis and Clark transcontinental expedition -- had been influenced by a visit to England's Epsom Derby. Indeed, the Kentucky Derby was originally run over a distance of 1.5 miles -- the same distance as the Epsom event -- before being shortened to its present 1.25 miles in 1896. The Kentucky Derby is also the first leg in the venerable Triple Crown, the other two legs being the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes. Considered one of the sternest tests in thoroughbred racing, only 11 horses have ever completed the treble, the most recent of which was Affirmed back in 1978. Jockey Borel's Kentucky Derby addiction . As the years stretch to decades, the search for that elusive champion capable of following in Affirmed's footsteps intensifies. A few have come close: in the last decade War Emblem, Funny Cide, Smarty Jones, Afleet Alex and Big Brown have all come within one victory. It's a far cry from the 1970s, arguably the races' heyday, when the Triple Crown was won three times -- by Affirmed, Seattle Slew and the great Secretariat. The enormous chestnut affectionately known as ""Big Red"" is probably the most famous winner of the Kentucky Derby. Secretariat was the first horse to win the race in under two minutes, and his record of 1:59.40 still stands today. He became a national celebrity, gracing the covers of Time and Newsweek, following his commanding performances in all three races. His 31-length victory in the Belmont Stakes ranks as one of the finest displays of sporting perfection by any athlete -- human or non-human -- in the 20th century. Secretariat's dominance in 1973 eclipsed the achievements of one of the sleekest, fastest thoroughbreds ever to grace a racetrack. Had he been born in any other year, Sham would have taken his rightful place among the sport's greats. His sub-two-minute time in defeat to Secretariat is still the second-fastest Kentucky Derby ever run. But while Secretariat has joined the ranks of the immortals, Sham is a mere footnote in history. African-Americans have played an integral role in the history of the Derby; indeed, the very first race was won by an African-American jockey (Oliver Lewis) and an African-American trainer (Ansel Williamson). In an era when African-Americans were still barred from participating in most mainstream sports (it would be more than 60 years before Jackie Robinson made his ground-breaking debut for the Brooklyn Dodgers), African-American jockeys went on to dominate the early years of the Derby, winning 15 of the first 28 races. That very first Derby was won by Aristides in front of an estimated crowd of 10,000. Nearly 140 years later, more than 100,000 people are expected to flock to Churchill Downs this weekend for a chance to be a part of America's oldest continuous sporting event. These days, Kentucky shares its Derby with the world. But it remains, in essence, very local in flavor. The hulking Churchill Downs with its famous twin spires is still imposing, but is showing its age. Outside of the Derby and the Oaks (the fillies-only race that takes place the day before the Derby), most of the racing here is low-grade. Louisville is not a rich town, unlike its well-heeled neighbor Lexington. If the venue feels a little frayed around the edges, that's because racing here is not a glamorous affair. Once a year, the international racing set descends on Louisville, clogging the skies over the city with private jets. Outrageously-plumed racegoers sip Mint Juleps from air-conditioned boxes while college students on spring break pack the infield. But when the renowned ""fastest two minutes in sport"" are up, the carnival will move on and racing will return to the people of Louisville. Kentucky has been the custodian of the world's most emblematic race for more than 100 years, and will continue to preserve its unique traditions for many years to come. It doesn't get more authentic than this.","America's Kentucky Derby horse race will take place on Saturday .

"San Diego (CNN) -- If you want to save souls, first you need to put folks in the pews. It works the same way with libraries, which -- without patrons -- are just large and imposing buildings full of dust and unread books, begging to be shut down by local officials the next time budgets are awash in red ink. Still, even for those who would like to see libraries kept open, it's worth asking: ""At what cost?""Â Traditionalists are sure to be horrified at the news that, in a trend that seems to be growing in popularity, more and more public libraries in the United States are supplementing their supply of books on science, history and literature with video games and big-screen televisions. What's wrong with this picture? Those are the types of electronic gadgets that, we have long been told, distract people and prevent them from reading -- especially teenagers with short attention spans. So what are they doing inside an increasing number of public libraries in the United States? It would seem that this is the last place they ought to be. The worldwide video game industry is projected to gobble up more than $70 billion by 2015. Can't there be one refuge from this tidal wave, and shouldn't it be a library? Maybe not. I admit that, when I first heard this story, my initial reaction was a wince. Call me old-fashioned. When I was a teenager, I liked spending time in arcades and in libraries, and yet I never confused the two venues. But the more I heard, the more supportive I became of libraries that go down this road. And I realized that this is just the normal evolution of the worlds of learning and entertainment. School for autistic adult teaches video game building . Video games are part of an elaborate attempt to lure teenagers into a library, in the hopes that, before they leave, they might actually crack open a book -- or even, dare to dream, check one out. The games have to be age-appropriate, and some are even educational in nature. According to a study published last year in Library Journal, about 15% of libraries in the United States now check out video games to anyone with a library card. And actual gaming within libraries themselves is believed to be far more common. Judging from some librarians who couldn't be happier with the results, the strategy is working. Teenagers -- boys in particular -- are coming to the library. And, in those libraries that have video games, books are being checked out at a rate that exceeds what it was before the gamers arrived. It sounds counterintuitive, but what if it turns out that the best way to get teenagers to even step foot into a library is to sweeten the environment with a few digital gadgets. What's the harm? Testing touchscreen tables in classrooms . Some might be uneasy with the concept, but what is new and different isn't necessarily wrong. Those who work in libraries can provide some context. They point out that, 20 years ago, the debate was over having CDs and VHS cassettes available for checkout. Ten years ago, it was over whether libraries should carry DVDs and install personal computers and provide patrons with access to the Internet. And now it's about video games. Besides, it's easy to criticize. But when was the last time any of these traditionalists even stepped foot in a library?Â When I was growing up in the 1970s, libraries were where you went to read books and research papers. They were a portal to new and exciting worlds, a pathway to adventure. Today, we do all that through electronic devices we can hold in the palm of our hand. Public libraries could soon become just another relic of the past, like the full-service gas station, the five-and-dime and the soda fountain in the corner drugstore. For those who love books and value learning, that's a depressing scenario worth fighting with every available weapon, and every conceivable strategy. Game on! The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.","Ruben Navarrette: Libraries are offering video games to lure younger crowd .
He says traditionalists may view the move as libraries selling their soul .

"Washington (CNN) -- Is a jihadist featured on a 55-minute video released by ISIS, warning the United States against getting in its way in Iraq and Syria, an American? That's the question being asked by U.S. intelligence officials as they analyze a recruitment video that features the jihadist, who speaks perfect English with a North American accent, orchestrating a mass execution. The United States is doing a voice analysis and comparing what it finds to people the intelligence community has been watching, the officials told CNN on Saturday. The analysis is in its initial stages, according to the officials. Officials see the killer's appearance in the video as significant because he comes across, they say, as articulate and persuasive -- a person of influence within the terror group. In the video titled ""Flames of War,"" the jihadist first appears speaking Arabic in a classical dialect and with the ease of a native Arabic speaker, CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said. But the ISIS fighter -- who is masked and wearing a camouflage uniform -- seamlessly switches to English. There are a number of men digging a ditch behind him. The jihadist claims they are Syrian soldiers assigned to a 17th Division military base near the Syrian city of Raqqa, and who now, after an ISIS attack, are ""digging their own graves in the very place where they were stationed."" CNN cannot independently verify that the men in the video were soldiers, as the propaganda video claims. How the 'Islamic State' is run, from oil to beheadings . The video then shows the speaker and a group of militants executing the men, who fall into the ditch. The man who led this atrocity on film could be an Arab who was educated in the West. Or he could be an American or Canadian. If so, Cruickshank said, he would be the first North American jihadist to commit a war crime on camera. ""Clearly ISIS had a calculated step to be able to put this guy on camera,"" said Frank Cilluffo, a security analyst at George Washington University. ""Why? Because he seems American. The message is aimed at a Western audience."" The difference between ISIS and al Qaeda . ISIS, ISIL or the Islamic state?

"Washington (CNN) -- Attorney General Eric Holder says the Justice Department plans to expand a review of police tactics to update training, technology and other standards around the nation. The aim, in part, is to produce broad national recommendations to enhance officers' safety, help them deal with new threats and also boost the use of technology such as police car and body cameras. In the wake of complaints about police handling of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, critics likely will also push for new standards to address police crowd control tactics and the use of force. The protests followed the shooting death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown by a Ferguson police officer in August. Associations representing police officers and executives have supported the idea of a commission to review standards. Holder, who speaks to a gathering of police officers in Little Rock, Arkansas, on Wednesday, plans to announce his support for such a commission to do the most expansive review of police tactics in 50 years. Holder on Supreme Court's Ohio early voting decision: A 'step backward' Holder, in prepared remarks, said the goal of the ongoing review is to ""swiftly confront emerging threats, better address persistent challenges, and thoroughly examine the latest tools and technologies to enhance the safety, and the effectiveness, of law enforcement."" An ongoing review is already doing some of the work. But Holder says expanding it would ""consider the profession in a comprehensive way and to provide strong, national direction on a scale not seen since President Lyndon Johnson's Commission on Law Enforcement nearly half a century ago."" Excerpts of his speech were provided by the Justice Department before delivery. Holder's speech is also intended to mark the 20th anniversary of a landmark crime law that created the federal COPS grants program, which funds community policing in cities around the country.","Goal is to produce recommendations to help police deal with new threats .

"(CNN) -- The Aedes Aegypti mosquito is just two to three millimeters long but its impact is devastating. Of the thousands of mosquito species, this one bears primary responsibility for one of the world's deadliest and fastest growing diseases. In the past 50 years, incidence of Dengue Fever has multiplied by 30 according to the WHO, spreading from nine countries in 1970 to over 100 today. There is no vaccine or cure for the painful virus known as Breakbone Fever, and of the 50-100 million people infected each year, over 20,000 die. Aedes Aegypti has spread with this epidemic, and has become the target of efforts to control the disease. But while solutions such as mass spraying of toxic chemicals have proved expensive, ineffective and environmentally damaging, scientists hope to use the insect as the agent of its own destruction. British biotech firm Oxitec is tackling the problem through pioneering genetic modification (GM) of the Aedes Aegypti. Scientists breed large numbers of the insects in laboratories and inject the sperm cells of males with a lethal gene. When the mosquito is released into the wild and mates with a female -- always of the same species - the deadly transgene is passed on and the offspring dies. Oxitec report successes from their Release of Insects with Dominant Lethality (RIDL) programme trials in Malaysia, the Cayman Islands and Brazil, claiming a 96% suppression rate in the latter case. This has proved enough for the Brazilian government to announce this year the first commercial release of GM mosquitoes into the wild. The treated insects are awaiting approval in the US. Oxitec CSO Dr. Luke Alphey claims the techniques the company has been refining since 2009 offers a high degree of control. ""In the target area we could suppress the population even to zero levels,"" he says.""It works. The engineered males can court and mate wild females and we can suppress the target populations as we demonstrated in the Cayman Islands and in Brazil. To a huge level, enough suppression to prevent epidemic dengue."" Alphey believes the concept could be applied at scale. ""I hope that it will become a major part of control of major pest insects. If we could reduce, even in some countries, the burden of diseases like dengue...that would be fantastic. We're just at the dawn of genetic control."" This approach is being widely adopted. Researchers at the University of California, Irvine have pioneered a method that renders mosquito offspring unable to fly, making them harmless. At Imperial College London, a team have suppressed malaria in trials by modifying mosquitoes to only give birth to males, which do not bite and cannot transmit the disease. Dr. Nikolai Windbichler, co-author of the latter study, uses a mousetrap analogy to illustrate the guarantee offered by genetic transfer. ""Even if one of every 10,000 mosquitoes would not function... it would not prevent the technology from suppressing populations. If you put up 20 mousetraps and one is not working, the remaining 19 would still be able to do the job."" The path of modifying mosquitoes has many supporters in the medical community. ""Scientists have made a lot of progress and there are many exciting projects"", says Dr. James Logan of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. ""If we can identify a single species which transmits a disease like the Aedes Aegypti and dengue fever, (genetic modification) can have an impact. It's less achievable for malaria, which is transmitted by many species."" Although there are still questions to answer, Logan wants to see expansion. ""We need more field trials to show the impact on disease transmission... I believe we need to push ahead, because the thing about mosquitoes with dengue fever and malaria in the wild is that they are always a step ahead, developing resistance, and we need new forms of novel intervention."" But critics believe that implementation of GM mosquitoes is happening too fast without enough understanding of the impact. Genewatch UK is demanding a public consultation in Brazil before the insects are released in the wild. ""Oxitec have omitted or failed to publish important information needed to make a decision"", says Dr. Helen Wallace director of Genewatch UK. ""The reduction figures from their trials cannot be verified and they have not proved a positive impact on disease. One problem is that if you reduce numbers of one mosquito species, another may increase. ""Many experts think that suppressing a wild population that is so mobile will not work and may cause actual harm, no one knows for sure but it is certainly irresponsible not to consider the risk."" Despite such concerns, the trend toward modification of insects for disease control is gathering pace as other solutions fail and regulators are favorable. Worms, flies and moths are also being targeted and 'weaponized' against their species. As this new battle commences, the stakes could hardly be higher. Read more from Make, Create, Innovate: .

"(CNN) -- Anthony Sullivan was a young Australian with Robert Redford looks. Richard Adams emigrated from the Philippines as a child and became an American citizen. The two met in Los Angeles, fell in love and got married in Boulder, Colorado -- long before any state legalized same-sex marriage. County Clerk Clela Rorex issued the gay couple a marriage license at 11 a.m., April 21, 1975. Nothing in the Colorado marriage code mentioned same-sex marriage, and Rorex signed licenses for six couples before the district attorney advised her to end to them. But the licenses were never rescinded. Sullivan and Adams believed their marriage was legal and embarked on a decades-long struggle to attain permanent resident status for Sullivan. They became the first gay couple to sue the federal government for recognition of their marriage, effectively launching a movement that helped lead to the Supreme Court's ruling a year ago that struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as between a man and a woman. But even now, a year after that historic ruling, Sullivan, 72, remains in America, undocumented. In April, he filed a motion for the government to reopen his case and grant him a green card. Federal immigration law says a U.S. citizen or green card holder can sponsor a spouse so that they can remain together in America. But because of DOMA, the law did not afford that right to binational gay couples. After DOMA's demise, about 40,000 such couples became eligible for immigration rights. Previously, they were forced to choose between love and country -- and many of them lived in exile to be together. ""The DOMA ruling completely changed the landscape,"" said Michael Sisitzky, an attorney with Immigration Equality, an organization that has been working with same-sex binational couples for two decades. It was a watershed moment, and within one week of the ruling, Immigration Equality heard from 1,500 couples seeking help. That's more than the total number of inquiries the group got the year before, Sisitzky said. ""It was as if a light switch had gone off,"" he said. ""LGBT couples go through the same process now as straight couples."" A year after DOMA, these couples choose both love and country . However, some people, like Sullivan, have been left behind, said his attorney, Lavi Soloway, a gay rights lawyer who helped found Immigration Equality. Six months before the DOMA ruling, Sullivan's spouse died. Soloway said gay and lesbian widows and widowers are fighting to get their marriages recognized even though they no longer have a spouse who can sponsor them for a visa. Sullivan hopes that the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service will allow him to live in the United States, as he has done for the past 40 years, legally. ""Common sense says that my petition should be accepted. Decency also says it should be accepted,"" Sullivan said. ""At the moment, I am just living my life day to day. "" A license and a letter . At 29, Sullivan left home in Sydney, Australia, and was in the middle of an around-the-world trip when he stumbled upon Adams at a gay bar called The Closet in Los Angeles. It was Cinco de Mayo, 1971. The two agreed to meet for a date the next day at Greta Garbo's star on Hollywood Boulevard. Soon after, they knew they wanted to spend the rest of their lives together. But Sullivan was on a tourist visa in the United States. He was not permitted to work. He would have to leave the country when his visa expired. They began to think about ways they could stay together. There was no country in the world then that allowed immigration rights for same-sex partners, nowhere they could go. Sullivan remained in the country -- illegally. Then, on television one day, they heard the most incredible news: a Colorado clerk had issued a marriage license to two men. Sullivan and Adams immediately made plans to fly to Boulder. Rorex, the Boulder County clerk, was 31, wore her skirts short and her hair long. She'd joined the National Organization for Women and was swept up in the movement for equal rights. She surprised even herself by winning the clerk's race. She'd been on the job only three months when a couple from Colorado Springs -- David McCord and David Zamora -- showed up wanting to get married. After she learned from the district attorney that nothing in the marriage code referred to gay marriages as illegal, Rorex granted the two men their wish. She did not know any gay people; she'd grown up in the small town of Steamboat Springs, Colorado, before it became a skiing haven. Her world was pretty insular. But she felt in her gut it was the right thing to do. Sullivan and Adams showed up in Boulder, got a license and then were married in a church that supported gay rights. The first thing Adams did when they returned to Los Angeles was to petition what was then the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) for permanent residency or a green card for Sullivan. They could finally envision a future together in the United States. But suddenly, after their marriage made headlines, their private lives had become very public. Newspapers ran stories about them. Phil Donahue invited them on his daytime TV talk show. Soon, they began to feel the sting of homophobia. Sullivan's mother wrote him a letter disowning him. ""Perversion is bad enough,"" she wrote, ""but public display, never. ... I can endure no more."" A woman in the audience of ""Donahue"" told Sullivan: ""I think we should give you a lottery ticket and send you back to where you came from."" Worst of all was a letter from the Department of Justice that arrived in the mail in November 1975. It contained only one sentence explaining a denial of a green card: ""You have failed to establish that a bona fide marital relationship can exist between two faggots."" The INS followed up with a second letter that said the green card petition was denied on the grounds that neither party was able to perform female functions in a marriage. It was inconceivable to Sullivan and Adams that anyone in government would use such language, especially that other ""f"" word. They filed the first lawsuit in America that sought recognition from the federal government for a same-sex marriage. But after years of legal wrangling, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the couple in 1985. The opinion, written by future Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, affirmed that marriage was between a man and a woman. Sullivan and Adams had lost. They tried to appeal to the Supreme Court but the justices refused to hear their case. Sullivan had exhausted every avenue available to him. He had a limited number of days left to voluntarily leave America before authorities would deport him to Australia. If he and Adams wanted to remain together, they had no choice but to leave the country. They felt like refugees because of their sexual orientation. There still wasn't any nation that recognized same-sex marriages, so Sullivan and Adams headed for Europe, where they had friends. They boarded TWA Flight 760 for London, leaving everything behind. For Adams, it was especially painful to separate from his mother and sisters. The couple floated around Europe like paupers for 11 months and eventually got fed up and returned to the United States by way of Mexico. Back then, crossing the border was easier, and Sullivan got through by passing as an American. Sullivan resumed life in Los Angeles under the radar of immigration authorities. In a way, it was a relief to live in hiding, away from the spotlight. In other ways it was painful. Sullivan's mother and brother died. Without documents, he could not travel and attend their funerals in Australia. The couple also had returned to an America reeling from the AIDS epidemic. They watched their friends get sick and die. They lived quietly, all the time fearing that Sullivan could, at any moment, get picked up by immigration agents. Bittersweet victory . In 2010, Adams was diagnosed with lung cancer. By then the gay rights movement had gained momentum and it seemed as though states were falling like dominoes on the question of same-sex marriage. Soloway, the couple's lawyer, knew there was a chance the Supreme Court would strike down DOMA. That's what he told Sullivan and Adams when he visited them on December 15 and encouraged them to go to Washington state and get married there -- just in case the government refused to recognize their Colorado license. They decided to marry again, except they would see it as an affirmation ceremony. Instead of ""death do us part,"" they planned to say, ""as long as there is love."" They never made it to Washington. Adams died the next day. He was 65. Several newspapers ran his obituary. He and Sullivan were, after all, pioneers in the struggle for gay rights in America. When DOMA was struck down a year ago on June 26, Sullivan watched the news with his dog Jasper. He thought it ironic that Kennedy was the swing vote. In Sullivan's eyes, the justice had redeemed himself for the decision he'd handed down all those years ago. The ruling was a victory for gay couples but bittersweet for Sullivan. He wished Adams were there by his side to witness history. ""It was a grave injustice he didn't live to see that day,"" Sullivan said. When Adams died, Sullivan's first inclination was to walk away from it all, to return to Australia. But he realized that America was home now. That's why he has asked immigration authorities to reconsider his petition for permanent residency. ""I should be allowed to continue my life here,"" he said, ""even though it's in a state of widowerhood."" Recently, he attended the premier of a new documentary, ""Limited Partnership,"" which chronicles his relationship with Adams and his battle to gain permanent residency. It will be shown in San Francisco on the first anniversary of the DOMA ruling. It was tough for Sullivan to sit through the film and see himself on the big screen. But he has no regrets. The U.S. government may not have recognized his marriage as legitimate, but for 41 years, he was a participant in a love story. It was the kind of love that many never experience. A love like Romeo and Juliet's. ""They never managed to separate us,"" he said. Love had won.

"Washington (CNN) -- In a late-night vote after a bitterly partisan debate, the House of Representatives passed a $694 million border bill Friday, but the measure has no chance of becoming law. The vote was almost entirely on party lines, 223-189, with just one Democrat, Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar, voting for it. Four Republicans opposed the legislation. The bill proposes to give the Department of Homeland Security more than $400 million for additional border security and law enforcement measures. It would allocate more than $20 million to speed up the deportation process by accelerating the judicial process, and also would set aside millions for National Guard border efforts and temporary housing for unaccompanied minors, among other things. The measure that passed Friday also included a change to a 2008 anti-trafficking law to make it easier to send home the unaccompanied children from Central American countries. The Democratic-led Senate had already left Washington to start a five-week summer recess after it was unable to pass its own legislation to give President Barack Obama some of the money he's requested to address the massive influx of migrants at the nation's southwestern border. At a news conference Friday, President Barack Obama dismissed the House GOP measure as ""a message bill"" and vowed to veto if it came across his desk. The vote came one day after a chaotic scene on Capitol Hill when House Speaker John Boehner was forced to abruptly pull an earlier version of the bill because it didn't have sufficient votes to pass. Some conservatives didn't like the price tag of the legislation and others demanded tougher restrictions on a separate bill that would halt future deportations of some child immigrants who arrived years ago. House GOP leaders had already agreed to hold a separate vote on that measure, modeled on a plan from conservative Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, which would prevent Obama from continuing his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy. Under DACA, the administration can defer deportations of children brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents. But conservatives wanted to end that policy, fearing that the President would use his executive authority to expand deportation deferments. After a late night of negotiations on Thursday, GOP leaders agreed to the demand. The House passed that bill Friday, 216-192, after a heated and ugly floor debate. Democrats accused the GOP of being ""anti-Hispanic"" and ""extreme"" -- a message the party will certainly repeat over and over before the midterm elections. Brushing off accusations that both bills were just political theater, House Republicans worked all day to lock down the votes from their members. They believed passing legislation right before they left for the break would flip the narrative -- instead of being the party that did nothing, they could claim they stayed and approved a plan while the Democrats who run the Senate left town without any action on the issue. ""The people's House is here working and we're not going to stop working until we pass legislation that actually addresses this crisis,"" said Rep. Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana. House Democrats said the Republicans would only make the situation worse. Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, warned that the House Republicans' legislation would cause the deportation of 600,000 ""Dreamers"" -- people who arrived in the U.S. illegally as minors and received conditional permanent residency under the 2001 DREAM Act. ""Republicans want to kill DACA and kill it quietly on a Friday night,"" Gutierrez said. But Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, said the President's move ""to use his pen and cell phone to legislate"" and allow children stay in the country violated the Constitution because it was up to Congress to pass new laws. Republicans criticized Obama for sending mixed messages to Congress on modifying that law. The President and some in his administration indicated they could support a bill to expedite deportations of children coming from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, but then backed off after Congressional Democrats strongly opposed linking that with additional border money. Without any agreement on additional resources to address the border crisis, Obama said Friday, ""we've run out of money."" Three weeks ago, Obama had asked Congress for $3.7 billion in emergency funds to help process the unaccompanied children at the border and boost border security. The Senate Democrats' plan called for $2.7 billion, but it failed to advance. The President said Friday he would reallocate money to ensure federal agencies providing housing or holding immigration hearings could continue to handle the increased activity along the border in Texas.

"New York (CNN) -- A transit advertisement depicting deceased American journalist James Foley moments before he was beheaded by ISIS was pulled from circulation in New York and San Francisco, according to the attorney representing the organization behind the ads, American Freedom Defense Initiative. The ad, which read in part, ""IT'S NOT ISLAMOPHOBIA... IT'S ISLAMOREALISM,"" was intended to launch Monday, appearing on buses and at the entrance of subway stops. David Yerushalmi, the attorney representing the president of American Freedom Defense Initiative, Pamela Geller, said he sent a letter to the Foley family attorney on behalf of his client Sunday in response to a letter from the Foleys' attorney requesting the ad be pulled. Foley disappeared on November 22, 2012, in northwest Syria, near the border with Turkey. At the time of his disappearance, he was working for the U.S.-based online news outlet GlobalPost. The video of his beheading was posted to YouTube on August 19. Yerushalmi's letter reads in part: ""As a mother, and one who still feels the pain of the hideous murders of many in her extended family by the Nazis, and with friends in Israel brutally affected by Islamic terrorism as a constant of daily life, Ms. Geller understands and feels intimately the pain your clients are suffering. Neither she nor AFDI wish to add to that pain, even if only tangentially."" James Foley's final months . The letter goes on: ""For this reason, and this reason alone, my clients have reached out as early as this morning to the New York and San Francisco transit authorities' respective advertising agents to pull the displays depicting the captive Mr. Foley prior to his beheading."" Yerushalmi said the ad was pulled ""as a matter of compassion for the family,"" but the rest would remain in circulation. Geller, who is behind the campaign, said the ad featuring Foley is speaking out against jihad terror. ""I am thinking of the family. I'm thinking of the next victim as well,"" Geller told CNN's Rosa Flores on Wednesday. ""But frankly, I think that that ad does a service to the family to expose the ideology that incites this kind of barbarity."" Diane Foley, James Foley's mother, said in an email Monday that her family received the letter and ""greatly appreciate the compassionate response."" Foley's mother 'appalled' by U.S. government handling of case . Ibrahim Hooper, the national communications director for Council on American-Islamic Relations, told Flores, ""These ads are targeted mainly at people who are not Muslims trying to get them to hate Islam and be hostile to Americans Muslims. Despite criticism, Geller said her message is not anti-Muslim, it's anti-jihad. ""There is nothing in my ads that say Muslim. We oppose jihad, and the idea that it's anti-Muslim, in my opinion, is a way of detracting from the message,"" Geller said Wednesday. One of the ads in circulation reads: ""Islamic Jew-hatred: It's in the Quran. Stop the hate."" Geller said she believes the Quran ignites jihad. ""There are numerous, numerous, verses ... calling for the annihilation of the nonbeliever. Smite them at their necks. ... Every action is accompanied by an Islamic prayer,"" she said. Peter Awn, a religion professor at Columbia University, said, ""to say that the Quran in and of itself is really what guides the choices Muslims make is really naive."" This is not the first time Geller has rattled emotions with edgy campaigns. In 2012, when the metropolitan transportation authority rejected one of her ads, Geller took her message to federal court and won. The 2012 ad read: ""In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel. Defeat Jihad."" All the ads launched Monday in New York have a disclaimer that reads: ""The display of this advertisement does not imply MTA's endorsement of any views expressed.""","""IT'S NOT ISLAMOPHOBIA... IT'S ISLAMOREALISM,"" ad says .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Electric shock guns, spiked metal batons and leg and neck shackles. These are some of the torture devices being made and exported by Chinese companies, fueling human rights abuses in Asia and Africa, according to a new report from campaign group Amnesty International. The report says that trade in what it calls tools of torture is flourishing, with 130 Chinese companies engaged in the production and trade of potentially dangerous law enforcement equipment, compared with 28 companies a decade ago. Most of the companies highlighted in the report are state owned, the report said, and openly promote their products at international trade shows and online. While some of the equipment such as tear gas, handcuffs and plastic bullets has legitimate policing uses, Amnesty says many of the devices marketed by these companies are intrinsically cruel and inhumane and should be banned immediately. Chinese officials questioned the report's credibility. ""I think you should not ask this question to the foreign ministry. We have no knowledge of it,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters Tuesday. ""But I would like to remind you that the organization you mentioned has always had strong bias against China. So I think it's questionable about whether the report is real."" ""Chinese authorities have done nothing to stop companies supplying these sickening devices for export or to prevent policing equipment falling into the hands of known human rights abusers,"" said Patrick Wilcken, security trade and human rights researcher at Amnesty International. The report, co-authored with the Omega Research Foundation calls on China to immediately ban the production and trade of inherently cruel and abusive equipment. It also urged Beijing to suspend or deny trade license for the supply of equipment when there is a substantial risk that the equipment will be used to commit or facilitate serious human rights abuses. Amnesty said the global trade in law enforcement equipment is poorly controlled and China is not alone in its failure to regulate the supply of law enforcement equipment to countries where there is a clear risk that it will be misused. It added that all countries should heed the report's recommendations. As many as 29 Chinese companies make electric stun batons that allow security officials to apply painful multiple shocks to sensitive areas of the body such as the groin without leaving long-lasting physical traces. A greater number of companies make restraint devices such as weighted leg cuffs. Spiked batons have been exported to security forces in Nepal and Thailand and have been reportedly used by police in Cambodia, while Chinese made electric shock batons are being carried by police in Ghana, Senegal, Egypt and Madagascar, the report said. Another example highlighted shows how Chinese-made riot control equipment was used to suppress protests against the rising cost of living in Uganda, killing at least 33. ""China's flawed export system has allowed the trade in torture and repression to prosper,"" Wilcken said. The report also documents how electric shock batons, mechanical restraints and other devices are widely used in detention centers throughout China. One practitioner of banned Falun Gong spiritual movement told Amnesty how she was tortured with an electric baton on her face: . ""It's a kind of torture the police call 'bengbao popcorn' because your face splits open and looks like popped corn.""","Trade in torture devices by Chinese companies flourishing, says Amnesty International .
Exports of police equipment are fueling human rights abuses in Asia and Africa, it says.
Much of the equipment is ""inherently cruel"" and should be banned.
Some equipment has legitimate uses but can still be misused, it adds."
"(CNN) -- The mission is anything but a Mickey Mouse task: Navigate the world's most treacherous seas, crossing 73,000 nautical kilometers in a confined space with stressed-out, sleep-deprived crewmates. That's the challenge facing two sailors -- Charlie Enright and Mark Towill -- who met on the set of a Disney movie. ""When they say this is the hardest race in the world, that's true,"" Towill tells CNN as he reflects on the Volvo Ocean Race, a grueling feat of endurance where competitors will face 30-meter waves in the Southern Ocean and winds of 110 kph (68 mph). With such conditions, tragedy is always a risk -- Dutch sailor Hans Horrevoets died in the 2005-06 race when he was swept overboard. The nine-month event begins in Alicante, Spain, on Saturday. Its eventual finish in June in Gothenburg, Sweden, will mark the longest route in the event's 42-year history. Not surprisingly Towill, general manager of Team Alvimedica, describes the buildup as the ""calm before the storm,"" while Enright admits it is impossible to predict what lies ahead in the coming months away from family and friends. To add a further twist in the marathon journey ahead, the American pair's crew is the youngest in the race -- skipper Enright is 30 while Towill is just 25. They are reunited seven years after meeting on the set of Morning Light -- the brainchild of Roy Disney Jnr., a nephew of the company's legendary founder Walt. Roy Disney, who died in 2009 a year after its release, came up with the idea of getting a crew of aged 18 to 23 to compete in the Transpacific Yacht Race from San Pedro in California to Honolulu in Hawaii. Hundreds applied but just 15 were selected, among them Towill and Enright. ""I just put my application in at the last minute as my flatmates did it,"" says Enright. ""I loved every minute."" From day one, despite the five-year age gap and differing backgrounds, the pair struck up a friendship that's still going strong. Enright hails from Rhode Island, a state awash with sailors, while Towill, from Hawaii, was the first in his family to take an interest in sailing. ""They wouldn't know what the boom or the spinnaker pole was but they're my biggest supporters,"" says Towill, who followed his newfound friend to Ivy League university Brown where they studied and sailed. Coached by Volvo Ocean Race sailors, they took on board every nugget of information they could about offshore racing before signing up in 2011 to the race's development program, learning the business side of getting together a team and the finances required. They worked tirelessly to get sponsors before Alvimedica, a medical technologies company that had already been liaising with race organizers, became a financial backer. Both parties' involvement was made possible by a cost-cutting rule for the 2014-15 race which meant teams would no longer make their own boats but use a centrally built Volvo Ocean 65 one-design vessel by Farr Yacht Design. It brought down the price of entering a team from $70 million to $21 million. ""It's a fairytale story,"" says Towill, recalling the surprisingly swift sealing of the deal. ""Alvimedica is a young company growing rapidly and we are a young team, so it was the perfect fit with American sailors -- and America's a big market for them."" That sole meeting spilled over to dinner, followed by a night out which eventually ended at 1 a.m. with a handshake to confirm the partnership. Enright and Towill needed to be up at 6 a.m. for a flight home but snuck out for another drink on their own to celebrate what they had achieved. For Enright, it was the realization of a lifelong ambition. He recalls in grade two at school putting together a project on the Whitbread Round The World race, set up in 1972 and by which it was known until Volvo became the title sponsor in 2001. ""It's the pinnacle of offshore racing, which is what I like most, and it just became a natural ambition,"" he says. As skipper, he knows the buck stops with him on the water and he admits he thrives on both the pressure and responsibility of seven other sailors relying on him for their direction and personal safety. Throughout the race, he will work closely with Towill as always, who he calls the yin to his yang, both with the shared aim ""to keep each other honest."" Towill admits to having gone into hibernation in the buildup to the race, knowing that there will only be snippets of sleep in the next nine months, and he expects their friendship will be tested. ""I'd be lying if I said it was going to be peachy all the time,"" says Towill, who turned down a job in renewable energy in San Francisco to follow his sailing ambitions. ""There's eight guys on a boat with not much space, stress and a lack of sleep. The dynamic of how we are as a group is important."" Amid the young guns on board, Australian navigator Will Oxley will provide experience. By the end of the race, the Volvo veteran will have turned 50 and sailed competitively more than the distance to the moon during an impressive career. Oxley's advice to Enright has been to ""keep it all in perspective."" The two young sailors and their crew will also be hoping for a Disney ending.

"(CNN) -- Kids are shuffled through numerous teachers, classrooms and schools during their educational career. Some will rack up a thick file of issues, while others will leave no mark, positive or negative, at all. Often in the current system, learning disabilities are not always caught, special talents overlooked, and students fall between the cracks. But in the future, schools could use tracking software and analytics tools to improve education. They will gather information about how a student performs and learns, discovering patterns, problems and promise that would otherwise get lost from year-to-year, if they're noticed at all. Information gathered about each student could become part of a larger data set used to learn what lessons and methods are working or failing across an entire school system. Smart classrooms that learn about students are just one of the major technological advancements IBM thinks we'll see in the near future. IBM has been predicting futuristic trends since 2005, releasing annual year-end lists of five technologies that it thinks will come to fruition in the next half decade. This year, most of the predictions are optimistic takes on what can be accomplished when the medical industry, governments, schools and computer systems gather and analyze unprecedented amounts of data about people, from their behavior and patterns as groups over time all the way down to a single person's DNA. A school that learns about its students to provide a more effective education. A city that improves public services based on citizens behaviors, schedules and movements. A digital assistant that monitors your health or improves your online security. Customized medical treatments based on an individual's DNA. And a return to local, in-person shopping by bringing customizing technology into brick and mortar stores. ""it is important that people stop and take a little bit of time to look at the stuff that's going to move the needle for society,"" said Bernie Meyerson, IBM's vice president of innovation, who heads up the project, called 5 in 5. Meyerson, who has been at IBM for 34 years, starts by looking at common ideas and unifying themes across various industries to identify common threads. In the eight years the company has been doing the project, Meyerson predicts it has had a hit rate of around 50 percent. Many of the past predictions had a positive social angle, like a new chemical formula that could make it easier to dispose of plastic, or making recycling a profitable venture for cities. Some are continuing to take off, like the emergence of telemedicine. Others, like computers that can smell, might never make it to the mainstream. 1. Can smarter schools make smarter kids? This year, Meyerson is most excited about the classrooms of the future. IBM is already testing out big data in schools with a program in a Georgia public school district serving 170,000 students. The project aims to improve graduation rates by tracking everything a student does -- including attendance, test scores, how they interact with electronic content, and what they are being taught in the classroom -- and suggesting improvements to tailor their educations. ""The education system works for you, it actually learns about you as time goes. I think that's a tremendous plus,"" said Meyerson. 2. Self-correcting cities . Cities are also in a unique position to gather data about people's daily lives. They can use technology to learn more about the behaviors and needs of large numbers of people densely packed into small geographic areas. For example, a city could determine the volume of people waiting on a train platform at any given time and instantly make small adjustments to the train schedules to ease congestion and delays. Mobile devices could increase participation in local government, with people reporting issues, communicating with politicians and make their voices heard far more effectively online than if they were in town hall meetings. Online petition sites such as Change.org and digital bullhorns like Twitter are already having an impact on local politics. 3. It sees you when you're sleeping, it knows when you're awake . On the personal level, IBM thinks ""digital guardians"" will emerge in the next five years. A program can learn everything about your online habits to confirm your identity and better detect when something is amiss. If you suddenly start uploading large volume of personal and financial data to a server in Eastern Europe, it might deduce that you have been hacked. The same technique can be used offline, using data collected from sensors in smartphones and wearable technology to monitor you physical activity and health. The accelerometer in your smartphone can detect a loss in motor control and set off an alarm to summon medical help. ""It literally creates an image of you. It knows who you are and what you do and how you behave,"" said Meyerson. 4. Medical treatment tailored to your DNA . Doctors take your vitals, flip though a manila envelope filled with a paper history of your previous visits and run tests to decide on the best treatment. IBM predicts that in the future, computers will be able to see exactly how a treatment will affect an individual based on detailed medical records that include detailed information, including DNA. People have different reactions to drugs and treatments, and this would cut down on the amount of time spent figuring out the best course through trial and error. The company is already working with health care partners on systems that will learn about patients over time and, eventually, take this type of health care to the cloud so doctors anywhere could benefit from the data. 5. Local shopping stages a comeback . No matter how fast and free Amazon Prime shipping is, physical store still have a place in our lives. They might even see a resurgence in the future by adopting some of the technology their online siblings have fine tuned. ""There's a certain category of product, and it is nontrivial, where there's a lot of resistance to doing something online without first getting your hands on it,"" said Meyerson. The futuristic experience starts with opting in and sharing more information about yourself, like your buying patterns over time. Walk in to your local store and it will know exactly what you're looking for -- what products you usually buy at a certain time of year or the week, favorite brands, allergies, that you love cheddar but would never touch American cheese. The store employees could make recommendations based on your past interests. The future is already here . Whether you think the ideas are creepy or brilliant, they are already on the way. These innovations are not just far-off fantasies, they're already starting to be developed and used in the real world, though still in early stages. The issues associated with governments, doctors and companies collecting increasing amounts of person data are also already in the spotlight. In the past year, there has been an uptick in awareness about what personal information is being collected about us and how it can be used by corporations hoping to make more money and by law enforcement. IBM's predictions focus on the other side of bulk data collection: more efficient systems tailored to keep people safe and healthy, encourage civic engagement and improve public services, help kids perform better in school, and support local businesses.","Governments and companies will collect personal data to improve services and schools .
IBM released a list of five innovations it thinks will take off in the next five years .
Smart schools that learn about students and cities that learn about citizens will emerge ."
"(CNN) -- The Mexican military has arrested four more people connected to the killings of 15 people at a January house party in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, bringing the total to seven suspects arrested and one killed, according to documents from the Mexican attorney general's office obtained by CNN. Last Sunday the Mexican military, in connection with federal police, arrested Heriberto Martinez, a self-proclaimed member of the Aztecas, a Juarez street gang that acts as the Juarez cartel's enforcers in the city. State prosecutors say Martinez committed at least four killings and acted as a lookout during the house party massacre in Villas de Salvarcar, a southern suburb of Juarez, in the early morning hours of January 31. The house party slayings of 15 people, most of whom were students with no ties to organized crime, has sparked outrage across the country. The slayings are thought by officials to be the result of bad intelligence by the cartel and by the gang that carried out the killings. Another one of the four arrested recently was Luis Alberto Camacho Ramos, alias ""El Shoker"" or ""El Flaco,"" who according to documents obtained by CNN confessed to participating in the house party killings. Ramos, along with admitted drug cartel member Jesus Bustos Renteria, was arrested in the beginning of March, according to the documents. The documents obtained Saturday, forwarded exclusively to CNN by someone close to the investigation, show that at least one of the four men recently arrested -- Alfredo Arias, alias ""Arnold"" -- was signaled out during testimony by Aldo Favio Hernandez Lozano, alias ""El 18."" Lozano was a municipal police officer arrested last month who state prosecutors say was a hit man in the January killings. During testimony, Lozano said it was Arias who originally called him to order the house party hit. Arias also supplied the weapons for the killings, Lozano said during testimony. Arias had been sought in connection with a different killing. Six people, including 26-year-old U.S. Air Force Airman David Booher, died in a November 2009 shooting carried out at a strip club in Juarez, according to Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz. In a press release last week by the Chihuahua State Attorney General's Office, Arias was identified as the gunman in the strip-club shooting through surveillance video taken at the club. Still photos included in the documents obtained by CNN show a man who resembles Arias, wearing a hat and hooded sweatshirt, removing a gun from his waist band and opening fire shortly after entering the club. Arias was caught on March 16, while driving his son in the colony of Plutarco Elias Calles. In his possession, according to officials, were dozens of rounds of ammunition and at least 3 guns, including an assault rifle commonly known in Mexico as ""un cuerno de chivo"" or ""goat's horn"" because of the gun's banana shaped clip. It is the weapon of choice for drug cartel members in Juarez. According to the press release, Arias was also the apparent leader of the drug cell ""Los Linces,"" and it was that cell that ordered the killing on January 31 in southern Juarez. Another man identified as the mastermind behind the killings -- Adrian Ramirez Armendariz, alias ""El Rama"" -- was killed by the Mexican military days after the house party killings. Arias ""was at one time in U.S. custody, but was later deported to Juarez,"" Reyes said. ""It really underscores the fact that many of the criminals we have in Juarez were illegal aliens in the U.S. that have been deported from the U.S. into Juarez."" Reyes said in recent years as many as 100,000 Mexican nationals living illegally in the United States have been deported to Juarez, just across the border from El Paso, Texas. ""We did a study of the killings during an isolated period recently and cross-referenced to the date we have of deportation. We found that 10 percent of those killed in previous months from the time we made this study actually had been deported within the last two years from the U.S. to Juarez."" CNN could not immediately authenticate whether or not Arias was at one time in U.S. custody. On Sunday, Reyes told CNN he was looking forward to meeting with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton when she visits Mexico this week. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano also is scheduled to visit Mexico this week. The announcement of the arrests comes on the same weekend a funeral was held in El Paso for two of the three people associated with the U.S. consulate in Juarez who were killed last week after they left a social gathering. Reyes said last week that authorities believe those slayings were carried out by the Barrio Azteca drug gang. No motive has been revealed, and no arrests have been made. About 200 U.S. federal, state and local authorities interviewed more than 100 Barrio Azteca members and associates in El Paso and southern New Mexico on Thursday, the U.S. Justice Department said.","Heriberto Martinez, member of a Juarez street gang, was arrested last Sunday .

"(CNN) -- The five writers knew a little about each other before they decided to pile into an SUV and embark upon a tour of five Southern states in seven days. But there's probably no quicker way to get to know someone than by spending a week logging thousands of highway miles, sharing hotel rooms (and sometimes beds) while visiting new cities, like traveling salesmen. The women of the Southern Summer Comfort Book Tour came together in the kind of self-funded promotional stunt that seems to be the norm for independent writers on small presses, which often lack the resources to support a book tour. Fortunately, the five bonded over a diet of whiskey, gas-station food and a shared love of writing. ""We were all slightly dreadful at first,"" author Chloe Caldwell said before a reading on the tour's last stop in Atlanta's Beep Beep Gallery. ""Now, we're like best friends. Spending all that time together can do that. Or it makes you hate each another, but luckily, that didn't happen to us."" Caldwell, 26, was hawking her new collection of essays, ""Legs Get Led Astray."" ""There are days when I prefer the boys I baby-sit to the adult boys in my life. To be a babysitter is to be part actor, part therapist, part housekeeper, part friend, part playmate, part athlete, part mom, part dad, part chef, part chauffeur, part waiter, and part saint, which I am not."" -- From ""Legs Get Led Astray"" (Future Tense, 2012) by Chloe Caldwell. With fewer titles accounting for a larger share of what Americans read, the tours serve as reminders that independent writers and small presses are alive and well, providing alternatives to the ""blockbuster"" titles that get most of the publicity in mainstream media. Initiatives such as The Lit Pub and Vouched Books, which helped publicize the Southern Summer Comfort Book Tour, promote small press literature through a variety of efforts. Efforts like setting up pop-up ""guerrilla bookstores"" at readings and art events remind people that great words are being written on small presses, said Laura Straub with Vouched Books. The writers on this tour were already familiar with each other's work through the ""vaguely incestuous"" world of online writing, said writer Elizabeth Ellen, 43, who assembled the lineup and booked the venues. The route from Texas to Georgia was based on a book tour that Ellen's husband did a few years ago and resulted from equal parts convenience and curiosity. Two of the writers, Mary Miller and Brandi Wells, already lived in the region -- Austin and Tuscaloosa, respectively. The rest were scattered north of the Mason-Dixon line and hadn't spent much time in the cities on the itinerary. A tour of the ""dirty South"" gave them a theme to work around, Miller said. Each writer brought her own personality and literary sensibility to the ""super trashy and weird"" group aesthetic of cut-offs and matching T-shirts. That included a liberal attitude toward alcohol consumption before, during and after the readings. ""We're taking ourselves on tour, so to take ourselves too seriously would be kind of embarrassing,"" said Ellen, a co-editor of the Hobart literary journal and keeper of the Bulleit Bourbon bottle (which actually contained Maker's Mark) that was passed around before readings. ""I didn't cook and it was Thanksgiving so we went to Old Country Buffet. It was after eight and they were already out of turkey. We ate macaroni & cheese and fish sticks and pudding and talked about Columbine. Eli and I had watched Elephant the week before. We were watching a different Gus Van Sant movie every week. All we did was watch movies, smoke cigarettes and weed."" -- from ""Middle School Sex"" (Future Tense, 2012) by Elizabeth Ellen. Writers, especially those on small presses, build hype for their books in a variety of creative ways, said Amy McDaniel, who runs Solar Anus, the poetry and fiction reading series that hosted the group's last stop in Atlanta. Some organize their own tours while others set up readings when visiting cities on other business, she said. Then there are contests and giveaways and oddball ploys for audience engagement. Poet Heather Christle included a temporary phone number in her book and on Twitter and invited readers to call her. Chapbook press Safety Third Enterprises publicized its newest book, ""Every Laundromat in the World"" by Mel Bosworth, with a photo contest and poetry bomb challenge. The Southern Summer Comfort Book Tour was partly funded with a Kickstarter campaign that raised $1,300 to help pay for some of the authors' airfare so they could meet and kick off the tour in Austin. Beyond that, they ponied up their own cash for the rental car, gas, lodging, food and admission to the home of American author William Faulkner in Oxford, Mississippi. In between driving and sleeping, they read to audiences in a puppet theater in New Orleans, bars bookstores and bars in Austin, Houston, New Orleans, Oxford and Tuscaloosa before their last stop in Atlanta. While the tour's name might imply many late-night parties, most nights they were asleep before 12, exhausted from constant driving and performing. The schedule was tight due to their full-time obligations, said Donora Hillard, who is pursuing a PhD in rhetoric and composition from Wayne State University in Michigan. ""Jeff Bridges tickles his aloe plants. He shivers and farts because . That s--- is poison, man, and better . out than in. This he tells you . in the voice of God. You walk. He says you are already dead . and you climb inside his ear. There is his silver mane, . then an ocean, then a universe."" -- from ""Theology of the Body"" (Gold Wake Press, 2010) by Donora Hillard. Hillard acknowledged that she probably fit in least with the tour's ""trashy"" theme, but relished the opprtunity to step outside academia for a bit to interface with readers. ""I love performing and having the opportunity to speak to an audience,"" Hillard said. ""If we're not affecting the audience, we're not doing our job."" Besides, she couldn't pass up a chance to spend time with other writers whose work she respected, even if the food and lodging left much to be desired. ""We were joking that it could've been called the Combos and Rollos tour because of all the gas station food we ate,"" said 35-year-old Miller, a Michener Fellow at the University of Texas. Expectations of publicity were also low, apparently. Miller said her publisher laughed when she said CNN had expressed interest in attending the Atlanta reading and joked that it must have been a slow news week. Yet, thanks to publicity from Solar Anus and Vouched Books, which promotes small press literature, attendees occupied all the folding chairs in the one-room gallery while the rest sat on the floor, beer cans in hand. ""What do you feel like doing tonight? he asks. This is your least favorite question the man asks. When he asks you this question, you feel very tired. You realize you don't want to do anything except sit on his couch, drink beer, and watch TV on the big screen. You don't have a big screen in your apartment. There is also never any alcohol in your apartment because you drink it all up, immediately. You want to watch America's Got Talent, but you can't say this. You'll have to flip through the channels and casually stop on it and say, is that guy double-jointed? Let's just watch this for just a second, and then a group of nasty dancers will come on or a water skiing squirrel and it would be impossible to change the channel then."" -- From ""They Could No Longer Contain Themselves: A Collection of Five Flash Chapbooks"" (Rose Metal, 2011) by Mary Miller. It wasn't exactly the most comfortable spot in the dead of summer, crammed among 40 or so strangers, front and back doors of the gallery open because the air-conditioning was useless. If the sweatbox atmosphere bothered anyone, it wasn't immediately apparent as they listened attentively, laughing and listening as each author read from her book. Wells, 28, got into the spirit by sharing a bottle of white wine wrapped in a paper bag with a friend from her hometown of Vidalia, Georgia. A highlight of the trip for her was throwing beignets at rats on the side of the Mississippi River in New Orleans. ""Perfect love is crawling inside another body and finding a miniature replica of myself, stealing the replica because I fear its destruction, and painting it with a semi-gloss lacquer to ensure its longevity. Somewhere there is a room of min-iatures formed to look like me, or almost like me. I worry there is a group of people searching for this room and they desire to burn it to ashes and to burn themselves to ashes and to insert those ashes into my body."" -- From ""Poisonhorse"" (Mud Luscious Press, 2012) by Brandi Wells. A guest author joined the group for most of their readings, with the Atlanta event featuring Scott McClanahan, who had driven nearly seven hours to read for 10 minutes. He left shortly after the event, while guests milled about outside the gallery, smoking cigarettes, and Wells and Miller hula-hooped.

"(CNN) -- As the number of swine flu cases rises around the world, so is a gradual backlash -- with some saying the threat the virus poses is overblown. Workers in South Korea, where one case of swine flu is confirmed, disinfect a terminal Sunday at Incheon airport. By Monday, 985 cases of the virus, known as influenza A (H1N1), had been confirmed in 20 countries, the World Health Organization said. The number of fatalities was at 26, including one in the United States. ""There is too much hysteria in the country and so far, there hasn't been that great a danger,"" said Congressman Ron Paul, a Republican from Texas. ""It's overblown, grossly so."" Paul, who was a freshman congressman during a swine flu outbreak in 1976, said Congress voted to inoculate the whole country at the time. Twenty-five people died from the inoculation while one person was killed by the flu, Paul said, adding that he voted against inoculation.  Watch Ron Paul talk about 1976 swine flu » . The United States' only death this year from the virus was a 22-month-old boy in Texas who was visiting from Mexico. The other 25 deaths happened in Mexico. ""I wish people would back off a little bit,"" Paul said. Others shared Paul's sentiment, saying the fear of the flu has gotten out of hand. ""We have people without symptoms going into the emergency rooms asking to be screened for swine flu at the expense of people with real illness,"" said Cathy Gichema, a nurse in Pikesville, Maryland. ""Schools are being shut for probable causes -- sending these kids congregating to the malls. How is that helping?"" Gichema said. Dr. Mark Bell, principal of Emergent Medical Associates, which operates 18 emergency departments in Southern California, said the level of fear is unprecedented. ""I haven't seen such a panic among communities perhaps ever,"" Bell said. ""Right now, people think if they have a cough or a cold, they're going to die. That's a scary, frightening place to be in. I wish that this hysteria had not occurred and that we had tempered a little bit of our opinions and thoughts and fears in the media."" Governments and health officials, however, say the concern is not unfounded. The virus, a hybrid of swine, avian and human flu, can jump from person to person with relative ease. And while most of the cases were reported in Mexico and the United States, some have been confirmed in countries outside North America. On Saturday, the virus strain was found in a herd of swine in Alberta, Canada, and the animals may have caught the flu from a farmer who recently returned from a trip to Mexico. It could be the first identified case of pigs infected in the recent outbreak. ""We have determined that the virus H1N1, found in these pigs, is the virus which is being tracked in the human population,"" said Brian Evans of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. But Evans and other officials said it is not uncommon for flu viruses to jump from humans to animals, and that it does not pose a risk for consuming pork. The number of pigs infected was not disclosed. In his weekly radio address Saturday, President Obama said the concerns over the new virus are justified because lack of immunity makes it potentially risky. ""Unlike the various strains of animal flu that were in the past, it's a flu that is spreading from human to human. This creates the potential for a pandemic, which is why we are acting quickly and aggressively,"" Obama said. The president, who said the virus is a ""cause for concern but not alarm,"" added the government has anti-viral treatment to treat the current strain of H1N1. In addition, WHO started distributing 2.4 million doses of a common anti-viral drug to 72 nations. iReport.com: How should H1N1 be handled? ""I think the world is infinitely better prepared than it was 90 years ago,"" said WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl, referring to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic that killed as many as 20 million people. In Mexico,  the epicenter of the outbreak, masks have become a common fixture. Nearly half the cases in Mexico involve patients 19 and younger, the health ministry said. ""I can hold for maybe another week or two and that's it,"" said Guillermo Jimenez, a waiter who hasn't worked in a week since the government ordered about 35,000 public venues to shut down. ""We don't have any money. We have mouths to feed. I don't know what I'm going to do now."" Still, some say the hype over H1N1 has led to undue hysteria. ""I'm sure the deaths in Mexico have something do with the infrastructure,"" said Anthony Markovich, a graduate student in Marina del Ray, California. ""I know our health care system has its flaws, but it is more advanced."" The world should focus on diseases that have more fatalities, according to Markovich. ""This is a joke compared to other things going on,"" he said. ""Malaria is killing thousands of people daily, the economy is not getting any better, it is time to move on."" Pakistan resident Faisal Kapadia agreed. ""When you put it in context, 700 cases in the world is nothing,"" said Kapadia, a commodities trader in Karachi. ""I understand it is a horrible new disease and governments should find a cure for it, but the media has created too much paranoia."" CNN's Emanuella Grinberg and Madison Park contributed to this report.","Ron Paul: ""There is too much hysteria ... there hasn't been that great a danger""

"(Lonely Planet) -- Go west, young man! This historic clichÃ© still resonates when it comes to road trips. But whether it's bombing to the Bay Area along the often dull-as-dirt I-80 or trying to find traces of iconic Route 66 amid a tangle of bland Interstates, the old paradigm of thinking horizontal when planning a road trip is simply not the way to go. Many of the best and most interesting roads in the U.S. run north to south, crossing the nation's striations and taking you from northern weather and cultures to entirely different ones down south. As a bonus these roads pack a lot into routes that are often shorter than the east-west standbys. New York to San Francisco is about 2900 miles by the most direct route, snoozy I-80. But Chicago to Miami on the legendary US 41 through Nashville is only 1400 miles and a thrilling journey from start to finish. Often overlooked, the old national highways (with route numbers proceeded by 'US') offer some incredible north-south journeys. At times the routes disappear under modern interstates but these are mere interruptions in authentic journeys of discovery and adventure. Here are some favorites. Lonely Planet: How to survive a boring road trip . US 1 (2400 miles) One of the great American road trips, this fabled road starts at the Canadian border in Maine and goes all the way south to the tip of the nation in Key West, Florida. Along the way it traverses 15 states, including 12 of the original 13 colonies. It hugs Connecticut's shore, razors across New York City, crosses Washington DC and hits the old south at Richmond, Va. Its rural meanderings in Georgia pass towns little changed in decades before it joins the balmy Atlantic coast in Florida and follows the beaches all the way through Miami and on to the Keys. Summer Travel: 10 best motorcycle roads in the U.S. US 41 (2000 miles) From the tip of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, where Lakes Superior and Michigan bracket the road, US 41 follows the latter lake down the coast of Wisconsin and into Chicago. There it veers southeast and wanders through the dense woods of Indiana and Kentucky, which abound in pioneer sites, especially ones linked to Abraham Lincoln. In Tennessee, the highlight is Nashville, the music city, before the road bounces down to Atlanta. In Florida US 41 links the resort towns of the Gulf Coast before cutting due east through the heart of the Everglades to Miami. Lonely Planet: The planet's ultimate drives . US 61 (1400 miles) From a start in the lake-dotted prairies just north of Minneapolis-St Paul, US 61 stays with the Mississippi River through Wisconsin, Iowa and Missouri, where it passes through Mark Twain country in Hannibal and the urban pleasures of St Louis. Continuing south through rural Arkansas and Tennessee, the route earns its legendary moniker 'the Blues Highway' as it follows the sinuous course of the mighty Mississippi through its namesake state's Delta Region. Crossing into Louisiana, US 61 ends fittingly at the blues clubs and other myriad pleasures of New Orleans. Summer Travel: Secret hotels of Florida's Gulf Coast . US 83 (1900 miles) The sleeper of great US roads, US 83 is anything but a snooze, especially if you want hundreds of miles of driving through wide-open spaces, often little changed since the last Conestoga wagon passed through. From Manitoba to Mexico, the route runs near-arrow-straight south through North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma. The skies are big, the vistas wide and the small towns offer respite from chain-filled Interstate interchanges. In Texas, the beautiful Hill Country is a highlight before the road hits the troubled yet fascinating Mexican border at Laredo and follows the Rio Grande River to Brownsville. Lonely Planet: Top 10 places to view the golden gate bridge . US 89 (1250 miles) No US highway hits more iconic national parks than US 89, starting with Glacier near the Canadian border in Montana. Hugging the east side of the Rocky Mountains it passes Yellowstone at the Wyoming border and then drops down behind the iconic Grand Teton. In Utah it passes the mineral-laced waters of the Great Salt Lake and in the south cuts between Zion and Bryce Canyon National Parks. Over the line in Arizona is the biggest spectacle of all, the Grand Canyon. Although US 89 officially ends at Flagstaff, you can follow its original route south through Tucson and Saguaro National Park to Nogales and the Mexican border. US 101 (1500 miles) Easily one of the most famous American highways, a journey along US 101 is the reason for many a trip. The road starts on the Olympic Peninsula across Puget Sound from Seattle. Then it curves around to the Pacific, which it never strays far from all the way south. The views become spectacular at Astoria, Oregon and never diminish as you pass the giant redwoods of Northern California right until San Francisco. Although many people opt for Hwy 1 south of here, staying with US 101 takes you through Steinbeck Country and Salinas and on past the historic 17th century Spanish missions that once lined what was then called the El Camino Real. At Paso Robles, hundreds of wineries vie for attention before the highway encounters the beautiful Southern California coast and follows the beaches through Santa Barbara. Further on it picks up the evocative name Hollywood Freeway and ends near downtown Los Angeles. Originally published as ""America's Best North-South Roads"" Â© 2012 Lonely Planet.

"(CNN) -- For many people, the name Sierra Leone still conjures up images of the country's decade-long civil war and subsequent war crimes trials. However, eight years after the end of the war, the country is hoping that tourism will be the key to its future prosperity. One organization with an innovative plan to attract the visitors back is Tribewanted, a project to build an eco-tourism community on John Obey beach, 20 miles from the capital Freetown. From October, the project hopes to attract tourists paying $450 a week to live in the community and help build a sustainable tourist village on the beach. The price includes all meals and a contribution to the community development. In addition, visitors will pay for their flights and transfers from the airport. Ben Keene, co-founder of Tribewanted, told CNN, ""We are going to be working with the local community of John Obey. We are going to build our village on this tiny peninsula and this is going to be our new life."" This is the second Tribewanted project. The first began four years ago on the Fijian island of Vorovoro, which the organization claims has injected more than $1million into the local economy. Elijah Eccles, a John Obey villager working as a cook on the project, told CNN, ""We want to have tourists coming in so a lot of people will have a job to do. ""We used to work with tourists before, but because of the war everything broke down,"" he explained. ""But we want the tourists to start to come again."" Daniel Macauley, another local working for Tribewanted, said: ""I believe that eco-tourism will be good for development because the locals will be involved and we are controlling it. It will help to develop the community and other areas like schools and healthcare. ""We are sending out a message to the world that Sierra Leone is open for people to come and visit, to actually see what we can give to them,"" he continued. ""There's a lot to come and see: the people, of course, and the country and also the nature we have,"" he said. Filippo Bozotti, co-founder of Tribewanted, told CNN, ""It's the perfect project for Tribewanted to partner up with the local community for sustainable development. ""We are looking for this to be a long sustainable project that helps the community in the long-term,"" he added. The area has already come a long way since the devastation of the civil war, which ended in 2002 with the help of a 17,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping mission. ""What's amazing is this whole place has been built up since the end of the war, so these villages have been built completely from scratch,"" said Keene. The World Travel Guide, which describes itself as the ""bible"" of the travel industry, said Sierra Leone was trying to recreate the tourist trade it enjoyed before the war, when 100,000 foreign visitors came every year for its natural beauty, secluded white sandy beaches and unspoilt rainforests. The guide said: ""The government is starting from scratch, going back to basics to entice foreign travelers to return to this small corner of Africa."" It said Sierra Leone was modeling its tourism development on that of nearby Gambia. The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office warns its travelers of petty crime, poor infrastructure and few health facilities. It said: ""Transport infrastructure is poor. None of the options for transferring between the international airport at Lungi and Freetown are risk-free."" The website VisitSierraLeone.org describes Freetown peninsula as ""a taste of paradise"". It said: ""Probably offering the greatest potential in the tourism industry, the beaches along the Freetown Peninsula are a sight to behold. ""As tourism is still a developing industry in Sierra Leone, the beaches are not overwhelmed with visitors which means that most are still in pristine condition and on a weekday you could have an amazing beach entirely to yourself."" A U.N.-backed war crimes tribunal in Freetown convened to try militia leaders on both sides of the civil war ended in October 2009 after seven years. Former Liberian leader Charles Taylor is still on trial in The Hague accused of instigating atrocities during the war in Sierra Leone.","Sierra Leone's tourist infrastructure collapsed during its 10-year civil war .

"Norfolk, Virginia (CNN) -- Mitt Romney on Saturday announced U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his running mate for the White House -- a bold and risky move that energized both conservatives and their opponents. Ryan is a rising Republican star and the party's leader on fiscal and budget issues. He said he is overwhelmed by the reaction to the announcement that he is Romney's running mate. ""I was amazed at the energy, the crowd, people who just want to see us take the country in a different direction,"" Ryan said. ""It's very exciting. We're going to win this campaign. We've got the wind behind us. I'm really excited about this race."" How Romney campaign kept Ryan tap under wraps . Ryan is the architect of a Republican spending plan that would overhaul many entitlement programs, making him a favorite of conservatives, whose support for Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has been shaky. ""You saw the response of our crowds, very excited to meet Paul Ryan to get to know him,"" Romney said. ""A lot of them know him pretty well by virtue of things he's been fighting for, but it just means one more person to drive a very strong message."" But the Romney camp was also quick to put some distance between Ryan's initial budget blueprint and his own. ""Gov. Romney applauds Paul Ryan for going in the right direction with his budget,"" the campaign said, ""and as president he will be putting together his own plan for cutting the deficit and putting the budget on a path to balance."" His running mate choice draws some clear lines with Romney's Democratic opponents over the size of the cuts in Ryan's plan and his prior votes on taxes, which they say favor the wealthiest Americans -- a point of contention in an election in which both sides consider themselves champions of the middle class. ""Congressman Paul Ryan is an outstanding choice as our country's next vice president, and today's announcement demonstrates Governor Romney's commitment to returning fiscal sanity back to Washington, DC.,"" said former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, who mounted the strongest conservative challenge to Romney's campaign in the Republican primaries. ""I have long supported Paul Ryan's fiscal and entitlement reforms to return our country back on a path of fiscal health."" Ryan, 42, is considered a policy wonk and conservative Catholic likely to energize the GOP base and sharpen the campaign's focus on government spending and the economy. That could boost Romney's appeal among middle-of-the-road Catholic voters in battleground states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania, though Ryan offers little in the way of foreign policy experience. The House Budget Committee chairman was chosen ahead of Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty and Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio. A campaign aide told CNN that Romney decided on Ryan on August 1. GOP sources said Friday that the latter three had all been told that they wouldn't be getting the nod. Meanwhile, Vice President Joe Biden contacted Ryan, welcoming him to the race, saying that he ""looked forward to engaging him on the clear choice voters face this November."" And Democrats were quick to make Ryan's fiscal policies a target. Analysis: A bold but risky choice for running mate . ""Congressman Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney are a match made in millionaires' heaven, but they'll be a nightmare for seniors who've earned their Medicare benefits,"" said New York Rep. Steve Israel, chairman of Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, ""For the last 18 months, we've said Republicans will have to defend the indefensible -- their vote to end Medicare. Now with Congressman Ryan on the ticket, House Republicans face the one thing they hoped to avoid -- a national debate on their budget that puts millionaires first and Medicare and the middle class last."" The announcement comes at the end of a week in which Democrats continued relentless attacks on Romney over his refusal to reveal more of his tax records and which saw three polls in 24 hours showing Obama with a growing lead over his Republican challenger. A CNN/ORC International poll released Thursday showed a big jump in those who had an unfavorable opinion of the GOP candidate. While some analysts saw Romney's choice as risky, others thought Romney had to go big. ""With Mitt Romney losing ground to President Obama in the polls, I don't see the selection of Paul Ryan as 'risky,' I see the choice as bold and necessary,"" Republican consultant Ford O'Connell told CNN. Timeline: Paul Ryan through the years . CNN senior political analyst David Gergen says the Ryan pick is ""an opportunity for the Romney campaign to go on the offense."" Ryan, appearing with Romney in Norfolk, Virginia, at the beginning of a four-day, four-state bus tour moved quickly to position himself and Romney as champions of voters dissatisfied with the economy and to draw his own contrasts with President Barack Obama. ""We won't duck the tough issues, we will lead!"" Ryan told a cheering crowd on the battleship USS Wisconsin. ""We won't blame others, we will take responsibility. We won't replace our founding principles, we will reapply them."" ""I hear some people say that this is just 'the new normal.' Higher unemployment, declining incomes and crushing debt is not a new normal. It's the result of misguided policies. And next January, our economy will begin a comeback with the Romney plan for a stronger middle class that will lead to more jobs and more take-home pay for working Americans."" Romney called Ryan ""a faithful Catholic"" who ""believes in the worth and dignity of every human life."" He lauded the fifth-generation Wisconsin native serving his seventh term in Congress as ""an intellectual leader of the Republican Party"" and a person who will help lead the country ""to widespread and shared prosperity."" Romney introduced his running mate saying that his ""integrity is unquestioned and his word is good."" Paul Ryan, top GOP voice on fiscal matters . But Romney, 65, initially flubbed his big line, announcing, ""Join me in welcoming the next president of the United States, Paul Ryan!"" He recovered moments later when Ryan took the stage, saying, ""Every now and then, I'm known to make a mistake. I did not make a mistake with this guy, but I can tell you this: He's going to be the next vice president of the United States."" At a later stop in Manassas, Virginia, Ryan picked up again on the economy. To choruses of ""no"" from the crowd, Ryan asked, ""Do you think the economy is heading in the right direction? Do you think we're getting our debt and deficit under control? Do you think the country is on the right track?"" ""Do you know why? he asked. ""Because President Obama is our president and he has put all of his policies in place and they're just not working."" Romney then took the microphone, touting energy independence, improved worker skills and enhanced trade opportunities. First, he drew cheers for his choice of Ryan. ""If you said one word about Paul Ryan it would probably be leader,"" Romney said. ""This is a man who learned leadership young because leadership is a function of character and courage."" Accolades on the veep choice poured in from Republicans. In a statement, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell called Ryan, the House budget chairman, ""a confirmation that Gov. Romney is serious about strengthening America's economic future, tackling the deficits and debt that have skyrocketed under President Obama, and returning to a path to solvency and security."" Pawlenty, in New Hampshire, called Ryan ""a respected leader and a bold thinker regarding the changes needed to restore America."" But the Obama campaign reacted to the announcement making familiar charges against the architect of GOP budget plans and tried to tie him to the incumbent's predecessor, which is consistently blamed for the country's economic doldrums. ""In naming Congressman Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney has chosen a leader of the House Republicans who shares his commitment to the flawed theory that new budget-busting tax cuts for the wealthy, while placing greater burdens on the middle class and seniors, will somehow deliver a stronger economy,"" it said in a statement. ""The architect of the radical Republican House budget, Ryan, like Romney, proposed an additional $250,000 tax cut for millionaires, and deep cuts in education from Head Start to college aid. His plan also would end Medicare as we know it by turning it into a voucher system, shifting thousands of dollars in health care costs to seniors. As a member of Congress, Ryan rubber-stamped the reckless Bush economic policies that exploded our deficit and crashed our economy. Now the Romney-Ryan ticket would take us back by repeating the same, catastrophic mistakes."" Democratic attacks on Ryan focus on changes to Medicare and Medicaid . The bus tour will take Romney through major media markets in four battleground states -- Virginia, North Carolina, Florida and Ohio. Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, once a potential running mate, introduced Romney. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Richmond native, joined Romney at stops in the commonwealth on Saturday. Prior to Saturday's announcement, many Republicans who spoke to CNN -- all of them granted anonymity to speak freely without angering Romney officials in Boston -- wondered why Romney would announce the pick on a weekend when millions of potential voters are likely to be distracted by the Olympics, PGA golf, late-season baseball and the box office release of the latest Bourne thriller.

"(CNN) -- In normal times, Lake E.V. Spence is a teeming 14,600-acre reservoir with a maximum depth of 108 feet, just west of the town of Robert Lee, Texas. In normal times, the reservoir serves not only the 1,000 or so people who live in Robert Lee, but also Midland, Odessa and Big Spring -- cities with a combined population over 230,000. But these are not normal times. In the past eight months this area has received 1 inch of rain. Only 3 inches have fallen in the past 12 months, and even though Robert Lee is now the reservoir's only customer, if the rains don't come, it will be dry by late winter. Texas is suffering from the third-worst drought in the state's history, according to state Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples. More than 2 million acres of farmland have been abandoned due to the exceptional dryness, he said, and the weather has been ""excruciatingly painful"" for producers, affecting the harvest of cotton, corn and grain. Tropical Storm Don teased Texas last weekend, making landfall between Beaumont and Corpus Christi, but it petered out into a tropical depression far, far away from West Texas and shriveling water sources like Lake Spence, some 250 miles west of Dallas. Photos posted online by CNN affiliate KWES in Midland showed parts of the reservoir that have been reduced to the basics -- the river that feeds it surrounded by acres of crackled, dried-out lake bed, some of it already being reclaimed by vegetation. ""I'll be 65 tomorrow and I've never seen anything like it,"" Mayor John Jacobs of Robert Lee said of the situation. The bigger cities, which have other water sources, are no longer allowed to pull from Lake Spence, but even with only Robert Lee pumping water, if it doesn't rain the town can expect to run dry ""around the first of the year or March, maybe,"" he said. The town is down to less than 1% of its water supply, and residents are under Phase 3 drought contingency plan, meaning no outdoor watering at all, he told KWES. Already, to try to achieve a 35% reduction in daily usage, officials are encouraging residents to find multiple uses for bathwater and other spent water. Right around the corner lies the prospect of rationing, or as Jacobs described it to the TV station, ""a pro-rated deal where everyone gets so much water per family member."" The only option for getting the water from somewhere other than Lake Spence is by pipeline or truck. Jacobs said the town still has an emergency plan to lay a 12-mile pipeline to Bronte, the nearest water supply, but not a foot of pipe has been laid yet. ""We're trying to jump through hoops with the state to get the permits,"" he said. And, it's not as though anyone in West Texas is doing much better. ""I don't know where you go to find someone who has excess water,"" Jacobs told KWES. ""We'd probably use the National Guard and I have no idea where they would get the water to truck in."" Llano, to the south, gets its water from the Llano River, which is drying up, and San Angelo, 32 miles to the south, is down to a two-year supply. San Angelo also is home to the nearest operating car wash -- a luxury by Robert Lee standards these days, the mayor said. ""You can see lots of pretty nasty cars around here."" CNN's Chelsea Bailey, Gustavo Valdes and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","The town of Robert Lee, Texas, relies on Lake Spence as its only water source .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A huge trove of artwork from the world's premier collection of Chinese contemporary art has been donated to a new visual culture museum in Hong Kong. The donation features 1,463 pieces of artwork by 310 artists, including many critically-acclaimed names such as Ai Weiwei, Fang Lijun, Zhang Xiaogang, Gu Wenda, Zeng Fanzhi, and Xu Bing, according to museum authorities. Valued at a total of HK$1.3 billion (US$ 167.5 million) by auction house Sotheby's, the works stem from a celebrated private collection amassed over the past three decades by Uli Sigg, a former Swiss ambassador to China and a renowned art collector. Sigg's collection is internationally acclaimed not only for being the world's largest trove of Chinese contemporary art, but also for its comprehensiveness and historical importance in documenting the development of contemporary art in China. ""The period 1979 - 2009 in China is a unique moment in art history. Given both the fact that many works, especially from the first ten years of this period were destroyed due to lack of interest from collectors and institutions, and the subsequent boom in the market for these works, it would be impossible to now build a collection similar in depth, scope and quality,"" Lars Nittve, the M+ museum's executive director, said in a statement. ""By joining forces with M+, the art works will ultimately come full circle back to China as I have always hoped they would,"" Sigg added. He said his donation is intended to ""enable these artists to have a space within M+ where they will communicate with an international audience, and where they will meet with a Chinese public."" The donation, which will form part of M+'s permanent collection, provides a tremendous boost to the yet-as-unbuilt museum, which is intended to be the flagship facility in an ambitious government-led project to create a contemporary arts complex called the West Kowloon Cultural District. The high-profile project has experienced repeated delays, scrapped plans, high staff turnover, and many rounds of public consultations since its announcement in 1998. Sigg's contribution is the ""most important development to date for the West Kowloon project,"" said Claire Hsu, co-founder and executive director of Asia Art Archive. ""It's extremely significant in the sense that it's an encyclopedic collection—he went about collecting it as if he was an institution as opposed to [assembling] a personal collection."" In a talk at the Asia Society in November, Nittve said he was discussing with major Asian art collectors the possibility of donations, given the museum had HK $1.7 billion in seed funding -- an amount that would not go far in purchasing top-notch Chinese contemporary art, which has shot up in price in recent years. A Zhang Xiaogang painting set an auction record of HK$ 79 million (US$ 10 million) for Chinese contemporary art in April 2011. ""It will be wonderful to have such an important collection in a public institution which can properly commit to its display and conservation for generations well beyond ours,"" said Yana Peel, a Hong-Kong-based contemporary arts philanthropist and founder of Outset Contemporary Arts Fund. Peel called Sigg's donation ""transformational for the museum and for our community."" M+ has also acquired 47 works from Sigg's collection for HK$ 177 million (US$ 22.8 million) under a split gift-purchase agreement. The museum is slated to open in 2017.","Most of world's premier Chinese contemporary art collection donated to Hong Kong museum .

"(CNN) -- Authorities have charged an Owosso, Michigan, man with two counts of first-degree premeditated murder in the Friday shooting deaths of an anti-abortion activist and another man, a prosecutor's office said. Activist Jim Pouillon was shot and killed Friday while protesting outside Owosso High School. Authorities say the suspect, Harlan James Drake, was offended by anti-abortion material that the activist had displayed across from the school all week. Drake, 33, is accused of shooting anti-abortion activist Jim Pouillon, 63, and Michael Fuoss, 61, who were killed in separate locations Friday morning, the prosecutor's office in Shiawassee County said. Authorities also have charged Drake with a felony firearm count and carrying a dangerous weapon with unlawful intent, the prosecutor's office said. Drake also is suspected of ""attempting to locate a third victim without success,"" the office said. He was arraigned Friday and is being held without bail, the office said. It was not immediately known whether he had an attorney. Pouillon, whose anti-abortion activity was well-known in the area, was protesting across the street from Owosso High School about 7:20 a.m. Friday when he was killed by several shots fired from a passing vehicle, Owosso Police Chief Michael Compeau said.  Watch Compeau talk about the incident » . Several people witnessed the shooting, and one was able to provide a license number, he said. About an hour later, Owosso police officers found the suspect, Compeau said. ""At the time of his arrest, the suspect made statements that he was involved in another homicide in Shiawassee County the same day,"" he said. Sheriff George Braidwood said a call had come to a 911 dispatch center about 8:17 a.m. saying that an employee at Fuoss Gravel, outside Owosso, had discovered the owner, Michael Fuoss, dead. He had been shot several times, Braidwood said. Authorities believe that Fuoss and the suspect knew each other, Braidwood said. According to Sara Edwards of the county prosecutor's office, authorities do not believe that Drake knew Pouillon. Operation Save America, the anti-abortion group of which Pouillon was a member, said in a written statement that he was ""well known for his love of Christ and unborn children."" The Owosso school district went into immediate lockdown after the shooting outside of the high school and remained so until the suspect was in custody, Compeau said . The high school's administration offered parents the option of picking up their children, he said. All after-school activities were canceled, he added. Owosso, a town of about 15,000 people, is about 25 miles west of Flint, Michigan.

"Durban, South Africa (CNN) -- Making cities greener ""actually makes a lot of sense"" in spite of the economic crisis, says former Irish President, Mary Robinson. ""You save money,"" she said, adding that the real challenge is greening cities in poorer nations, like Bangladesh, where people live in ""almost impossible conditions."" Robinson was one of four leading climate change thinkers discussing how viable it is to invest in sustainable cities in a debate hosted by CNN's Robyn Curnow during the 2011 U.N. Conference on Climate Change last week in Durban. Joining Robinson on the panel were Pan Jiahua, advisor to the Chinese delegation at the conference, Elliot Diringer, former adviser to the Bill Clinton's U.S. presidential administration and Kumi Naidoo, executive director of Greenpeace International. Below is an edited version of the debate. CNN: Why would people now, especially in the current economic climate, think they need to go green? Mary Robinson: Well, actually, it makes an awful lot of sense. If you make your home more efficient, you save money. Here in Durban, there is an exhibition of how to make buildings greener, how to make transport greener, and that is the way we have to go. But we have to recognize that our biggest growth in cities will be in poor developing countries -- I was in Dakar recently, in Bangladesh, and saw people living in almost impossible conditions and that is the real challenge. Could big cities lead the fight against climate change? CNN: China has seen a twenty-fold increase in the number of cars over the past decade and expects energy consumption to double by 2030. What is the country doing to ensure that growth is green? Pan Jiahua: That is one part of the story -- the other part of the story is that we have consensus. We are very much aware of the challenges and that is why we have been so aggressive and that is why we have to (explore) nuclear and that is why we have to set a very challenging target by 2015 and 2020 for renewable energy development. CNN: Do you think China is doing enough? Kumi Naidoo: China had made an assessment that not only is it right to invest in green technologies because of climate change, but in fact that it was actually good for the economy. Because countries that are going to dominate the future economy -- you can forget about the arms race and the space race -- the only countries that are going to do well in the future are those that win the green race. CNN: You were part of the team that helped negotiate the Kyoto protocol -- are you disappointed about the state of where things are now? Elliot Diringer: I am disappointed about the lack of action in the United States, the lack of action in other countries, the lack of progress at the international level. But we have to learn the lessons of the last 15 years since Kyoto was negotiated -- we have been going in circles for 15 years now insisting on binding commitments. Unfortunately, the United States and others aren't ready for that. We can't abandon that goal but we can't keep beating ourselves up year after year expecting it now. Kumi Naidoo: I agree with that but let's just be honest -- what's on the table at the moment is lacking in ambition, lacking in urgency. We have to be honest with the people in all the world and say that in fact we are failing you, we are sleepwalking the planet into a crisis of epic proportions. CNN: What are for you the greenest cities? What's the model to aspire to? Mary Robinson: There are very good Scandinavian models. I would like to see the implementation of what I heard yesterday -- that solar can be cheaper than kerosene for poor communities. I want green slum areas -- around most cities in the developing world you have these informal settlements and slum areas and that is where the real challenge is and that is where affordable and clean energy can transform those areas. Cities blazing a green trail . Kumi Naidoo: Cities have to look, from top down, how they are using energy, where they actually locate offices, what transportation distances people have to travel to work, what kind of transportation they have to travel (in). In fact our quality of life in cities in the main is going down and down. All countries have to begin to ask ourselves, what kind of society and consumption patterns gives us happiness, contentment and prosperity and I have to say that there is a lot of meaningless consumption that is contributing to this problem and we have to challenge what we consume. Pan Jiahua: In this regard, China is more advanced. Over two-thirds of ... (our) cities ... have low-carbon city planning, and we have very clear targets within these cities to reduce energy consumption, to reduce their carbon emissions and not only from the production side but from the consumer side. And we are going to change our behaviors. You are talking about the increase in car ownership, well now the Chinese are coming back to bicycles. I think we are moving in the right direction and we need to accelerate the process. Elliot Diringer: I think we need cities that offer people green choices. It is difficult to mandate changes in people's behavior and lifestyle but you need to offer people the right choices and they will take them. So, mass transit that is convenient; charging stations so you can have plug in electric vehicles and know that you can recharge them; car sharing arrangements; bicycle sharing arrangements.","CNN hosted a panel discussion with four leading environmental figures on the sidelines of COP17 .

"(CNN) -- A national park ranger fell to his death on Mount Rainier Thursday afternoon while assisting in the rescue of four injured climbers. Climbing Ranger Nick Hall fell about 3,700 feet down the northeast side of the mountain as he helped prepare the other climbers for extrication by helicopter, said Kevin Bacher, a Mount Rainier National Park spokesman. The climbers from Waco, Texas, had to be rescued after they slipped down the Emmons Glacier after a successful summit of the mountain. All of them were tied together. Their plunge down the mountainside left two of them dangling in a crevasse. They called for help with a cell phone. None of their injuries were life-threatening. Three of the climbers were eventually lifted off the mountain by Chinook helicopters from Joint Base Lewis-McChord despite stormy conditions. The fourth climber is spending the night on the mountain with two rangers, Bacher said. From the archives: Mount Ranier ranger shot dead in January .

"(CNN) -- Ten years ago, ""No Child Left Behind"" became the law of the land. Enacted under President George W. Bush's administration with the promise to focus on individual student achievement and overall school performance, No Child Left Behind was heralded as groundbreaking. And in some ways, it was. The expanded use of data helped superintendents, principals and teachers pay more attention to the students with the greatest need. Parents now have more access to important information about the quality of teachers and schools, and some student achievement gaps have narrowed. Hindsight is 20/20, and after a decade of No Child Left Behind, we can clearly identify the law's weaknesses. As it turns out, the ""Adequate Yearly Progress"" measurement, which requires all schools to meet targets for student proficiency or face the same federal interventions, is unrealistic and restricts states' and school districts' ability to effectively gauge student learning and tailor curriculum accordingly. The law's ""Highly Qualified Teacher"" requirements value tenure and credentials over an educator's ability to motivate students in the classroom. Strict mandates and funding restrictions stunt the development of innovative local education programs. Our children deserve better. Across the country, reform-minded individuals are challenging the status quo in exciting ways, and students are benefiting from their efforts. In Florida, for example, former Gov. Jeb Bush enacted far-reaching school reforms that improved the academic achievement of the state's Hispanic and black students. State legislators in Tennessee and Indiana are overhauling teacher evaluations to ensure student performance is a significant factor in measuring an educator's effectiveness. We must revamp K-12 education law to ensure Washington does not stand in the way of meaningful reforms. After months of hearings and bipartisan discussions, the House Education and the Workforce Committee will soon consider legislation that will enhance accountability, improve flexibility and support more effective teachers in the classroom. Enhanced accountability: No Child Left Behind taught us that parents, teachers and state and local leaders are more suited to address students' needs than a one-size-fits-all accountability system developed by Washington bureaucrats. During one of the first committee hearings of the 112th Congress, Indiana Superintendent Tony Bennett said, ""As a former teacher, principal and school superintendent, I am a strong believer in local control. Indiana's school leaders are in a better position to know what's best for the students in their communities... They understand the cultural and economic factors unique to their districts, and they are in the best position to drive innovation."" He's right. It's time to put control back in the hands of those who interact daily with our children. Our legislation will call on each state to implement its own accountability system that considers the challenges and opportunities facing local schools and more accurately evaluates student achievement. We propose eliminating federally mandated interventions for under-performing schools and allowing states themselves to determine the best way to raise the bar. Improved flexibility: The Department of Education operates about 80 programs tied to K-12 classrooms, each with its own set of burdensome rules and reporting requirements. According to Virginia's Loudoun County Public Schools Superintendent Edgar Hatrick, navigating this complicated system often results in ""resources being diverted from the mission of teaching and learning."" Worse, the strict regulations for some federal education funds can prevent eligible schools from applying the money to the initiatives that best serve their students. As Oklahoma State Superintendent of Public Instruction Janet Barresi told our committee last April, ""We would very much welcome the opportunity to decide for ourselves how these dollar bills are spent... It would allow us to focus on the individual child instead of focusing on funding the program or funding the school."" By combining most of these programs into one flexible grant, our legislation will cut through red tape and enable states to dedicate federal funds to a range of local education priorities, from acquiring new technology to supporting additional literacy programs. School districts will have the freedom to distribute federal funds based on the needs of their own student populations. Superintendents and principals will be able to use federal funding for groups such as English learners, migrant students and Native Americans to support a better classroom experience for all children. More effective teachers: The best teachers are those who keep students motivated, challenged and flourishing. Instead of placing excessive emphasis on credentials and tenure, our proposal will provide incentives for school districts to develop and implement their own teacher evaluations based on student learning. It will also support approaches such as performance pay and alternative paths to certification, which will help recruit and keep the most effective educators in our schools. Every child deserves to be inspired by a great teacher, just as every student deserves access to a quality education. House Education and the Workforce Committee Republicans are leading the way toward a better education system in which parents, teachers and state and local leaders are empowered to build superior schools and improve student achievement. With thousands of American schools labeled as ""failing"" under No Child Left Behind, the urgency to reform the law has never been greater. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Kline.","John Kline: No Child Left Behind's ""one size fits all"" approach doesn't work .
New law would leave decisions on teacher accountability to states, he says .
Kline: States will decide how to use ""one lump"" federal grants .

"(CNN) -- Panicked customers rushed to the exits when a gunman opened fire Tuesday at a mall outside Portland, Oregon. Some people huddled behind store counters and hid behind racks of clothing. The mall's Santa dropped to the ground. Three people were killed, including the shooter, said Lt. James Rhodes of the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office. The shooter died of a self-inflicted gunshot, he said. One person suffered a traumatic injury. A witness told CNN he tried to help a wounded woman who was lying on the ground by a cell phone store. ""She had apparently been shot in the chest, and I couldn't get her turned over to help her,"" said Antonio Charro, who had been shopping at the mall with his daughters. ""There was no one around. She wasn't breathing."" Witnesses said a masked man with a gun headed toward the food court at the two-story Clackamas Town Center mall, located about 11 miles southeast of downtown Portland. Read tweets from people at the scene . A woman told CNN affiliate KOIN that she saw a man wearing a hockey mask jogging through Macy's and wielding an assault rifle. ""Everyone ran toward the exits at that point to get out,"" she said. Outside Macy's, gunshots echoed where a man portraying Santa Claus was snapping photos with kids. ""I heard two shots, then 15 or 16 more shots,"" he told CNN affiliate KGW. ""I hit the floor."" The sounds of gunfire rang out through the mall, witnesses said. ""We heard one gunshot. It sounded like something fell,"" David Moran, an employee at the mall, told CNN. ""Then it was a matter of two or three seconds, and then it was just rapid gunfire."" Customers and employees alike started running for the exits, Moran said. ""I thought I was going to die,"" he said. ""The gunshots were so loud, it was very scary. ... Kids were crying. Parents were crying, too."" Inside Sears, some customers burst into tears as word spread of the shooter going store to store, Christina Fisher told KOIN. ""We were told to stand in a group by the top of the escalators and stay away from the windows out of the aisle. ... We stood there for probably a good 20 minutes,"" she said. ""All of the sudden, somebody came through with a radio, yelling 'get down!'"" Are you there? Share your stories, videos and images. A group of customers inside Sears watched television news reports about the shooting inside the store's entertainment center, witness Tylor Pedersen told CNN affiliate KGW. Pedersen said he heard about the shooting when people ran into the store, saying they had heard shots fired in the middle of the mall. ""I didn't think it was real at first until I saw the reactions on their faces,"" he said. ""They were serious."" Authorities put the mall on lockdown as they searched for the shooter, witnesses said. Later, they escorted people outside. ""All of us had to have our hands raised, because they didn't know who the shooter was yet,"" said Larisa Terekhova, who posted a video online that showed people leaving the mall with their arms in the air. Gov. John Kitzhaber praised first responders for reacting quickly to the shooting. ""I have directed State Police to make any and all necessary resources available to local law enforcement,"" he said in a statement. Authorities closed entrances and exits into the mall parking lot Tuesday evening, said Lt. Gregg Hastings of the Oregon State Police. A spokesman for General Growth Properties, which owns the mall, referred questions about the shooting to the sheriff's office.

"(CNN) -- At the 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest, Romania, Vladimir Putin told a surprised George W. Bush, ""You have to understand, George, that Ukraine is not even a country. Part of its territory is in Eastern Europe and the greater part was given to us."" Six years later, the Kremlin appears to be making sure that Putin's opinion becomes a reality. For Moscow, the drama that has been unfolding in Ukraine for the past three months is a domestic and an international issue. After all, if a revolution can unseat an unpopular, corrupt government in Kiev, why not in Moscow? Follow the latest developments in Ukraine . That was Moscow's nightmare scenario during the 2004 Ukrainian Orange Revolution, and it remains a major concern even though Putin's popularity rating in Russia runs at a healthy 60% today. Beyond that, Ukraine is closely linked to Russia's return to the world stage as a great power that should be entitled to a ""sphere of privileged interests"" in its backyard. Putin has said that the collapse of the Soviet Union was the ""greatest geopolitical tragedy"" of the 20th century. His project for his third term as President is to gather in as many of his neighbors as he can to form a new Eurasian Union. Ukraine is the key to that project. And Crimea is the key to Ukraine. Sixty years ago, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev ""gave"" the Crimean Peninsula -- for the previous 300 years part of the Russian empire and the U.S.S.R. -- to the Ukrainian Soviet Republic because they were all part of the Soviet Union and it was meant as a symbolic gesture. After the Soviet collapse, Crimea suddenly became part of an independent Ukraine to Moscow's shock. Moscow and Kiev worked out a deal to divide the Soviet Black Sea Fleet between Russia and Ukraine. In 2010, Ukraine extended the Russian lease until 2042. When Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted last week and fled to Russia, the Kremlin worried it might lose its lease and have to withdraw its fleet from this strategic area. The initial Russia move to occupy Crimea was designed to protect Russian naval equities on the Peninsula. Some 60% of Crimea's population is Russian and appears to support the current Russian occupation. But Russian interests and troops reach beyond that. Opinion: The two Putins . A key Putin goal since he came to power in 2000 has been to prevent either NATO or the European Union from encroaching in the post-Soviet space. That's why Russia offered Yanukovych a $15 billion loan to counter the EU's more modest offer in December. By occupying Crimea, Russia wants to ensure that only a rump Ukraine could negotiate with the EU in the future. If the current conflict does not spread to other parts of eastern Ukraine -- where there is a sizable population that is demanding closer ties to Russia -- then Crimea could join the ranks of other ""frozen conflicts"" in the post-Soviet space. These entities with substantial Russian-speaking populations exist in de facto ministates with Russian military protection within the borders of a larger state whose jurisdiction they do not recognize, such as the Transnistria region in Moldova. Russian support for these breakaway regions ensures that Moldova, Georgia and now Ukraine will not enjoy full sovereignty over their territory and that Russia will always have a role to play there. Occupying Crimea and raising tensions in eastern Ukraine to prevent Ukraine from moving toward more Western influence is a top priority for the Kremlin. The Ukrainian stakes are far higher for Moscow than they are for either Brussels or Washington. The United States can threaten economic sanctions, expel Russia from the G-8 and consider a range of other measures, but the Kremlin must have already discounted these possible countermeasures well before it executed its carefully planned takeover of Crimea. If maintaining a good relationship with the United States were a top priority for Putin, he would not have granted U.S. intel leaker Edward Snowden asylum in August. Guaranteeing and expanding the Russian presence in Crimea is much more important. Opinion: How Putin carries out power grab . Given Russia's determination not to back down from Crimea, the United States and its allies will have to focus on containing the advance of Russian troops beyond Crimea and trying to ensure that an unanticipated local conflict between groups under the control neither of Moscow nor Kiev could not precipitate a broader armed struggle in Ukraine. The fragile interim government in Kiev will need substantial economic support and must be encouraged not to let itself be provoked into a war with Russia as Georgia was in 2008. Because if there were an armed conflict, neither the United States nor NATO would get militarily involved, and the result could be the dismemberment of Ukraine and its division into two states on either side of a new East-West divide.

"USS George Washington, East China Sea (CNN) -- By his own admission, one of the U.S Navy's top commanders says his Pacific fleet ""gets all the best stuff"" when it comes to state-of-the-art weaponry -- an undeniable reflection of President Barack Obama's so-called pivot towards Asia. The flagship of its 7th fleet, the Nimitz-class USS George Washington aircraft carrier boasts a formidable arsenal; from the latest FA-18 fighter jets, to anti-submarine helicopters and early-warning surveillance aircraft. Add to this the fleet's numerous missile destroyers, cruisers and submarines and the statement of intent is clear to see -- Washington is serious about its role in the region. ""It's a long-term effort for us here,"" Fleet commander Vice Admiral Robert L. Thomas, told CNN aboard the giant vessel amid the muffled roar of jet engines from the flight deck directly above. ""From a policy perspective it's a shift in balance of not only our resources but our thinking across diplomatic, information, economic and military lines to the Pacific. ""But I would offer that the 7th Fleet never left -- we've been a strong presence here for the past 70 years. We're slowly shifting from a 50/50 mix in the United States Navy to a 40% Atlantic, 60% Pacific mix,"" he added, referring to the gradual swing away from traditional areas of operation in the West. 'Most advanced' weapons . ""From a military point of view -- my narrow swim lane of responsibility -- we measure our presence in two ways: capability and capacity. The capacity is coming -- more numbers over time -- but it's the capability that's leading the charge here. ""I get the preponderance of Virginia-class warships. I get the front-line submarine deployments out here. The carrier air wing that operates from the George Washington is the most advanced in the U.S. Navy -- and our task force commanders out here get the full support of the 'home office' in Washington."" In the past few days, these hugely expensive military ""assets"" have been deployed on a high-profile combat exercise with an armada of ships from the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) off the island of Okinawa, playing out a series of scenarios including the defense of Japan and the response to a regional crisis -- timely given China's increasingly assertive behavior in the region. China looms over U.S.-Japan drills . At the same time, China's own military development has been emphasized by the first deployment of its own aircraft carrier -- The Liaoning. While most analysts would point to it being decades behind its American counterparts technologically -- it's actually a refitted Soviet-era vessel purchased from the Ukraine in the 1990s -- its very existence is emblematic of Beijing's growing ambitions. Diverse security threats . Yet beyond the waters of the East China Sea, the threats to global stability in recent years have become far more complex and diverse and less likely to be played out on traditional battlegrounds where huge armies or navies face off against each other. The threat has become more asymmetric and complex in nature, with unseen enemies striking in less predictable but equally damaging ways -- something Thomas concedes -- prompting inevitable questions about whether these huge fleets are a worthwhile investment and relevant in this new security landscape. ""The maritime domain in general has got more complex, with the undersea domain a huge part of that with more sophisticated submarines and the emergence of long-endurance, unmanned or remotely operated vehicles,"" he said. ""You see it just in oceanographic capabilities. Frankly the way countries globally are using technology in the undersea domain is going to make it a very interesting operational space. So the traditional 'hey I've got a submarine and I get to play here,' mindset I think is naÃ¯ve. You're going to have to bring a lot more capability into that operating space to ensure you stay dominant -- economically as well as militarily. ""As to the asymmetric threats, the one thing that cannot be counted out is the ability of terrorists to use the maritime domain. It's not just in close, such as we saw when the USS Cole was attacked (in port in Yemen in 200), all of a sudden it's threats to commercial shipping and 'choke' points. ""Major commercial carriers such as Maersk all have immediate response actions already in place in case the Singapore Strait is cut off or they can't use a port due to a weapon of mass destruction."" He said this was a major ""economic game changer"" when you consider the cost of shutting down major waterways or ports due to terrorist threats. ""So a lot more thinking has to be done"" about how to counter these kind of challenges, he added. The nature of the joint exercises with Japanese forces -- known as AnnualEx 2013 and involving more than 23 ships and 20,000 servicemen and women -- in part acknowledges this, he said, with the fleet deployed on a variety of ""graduate level"" missions, from anti-submarine warfare, to defending against hostile incursions against territory. Awesome power . Standing on the flight deck of the USS George Washington, the noise of combat jets as they take off and land just meters away generates an incredible vibration that almost lifts you from your feet -- awesome power that is very difficult not to be impressed by whether you're a journalist or a foreign power. But Thomas seems anything but a man on the verge of using this immense force in anger -- especially against any perceived Chinese threat. U.S. 'advising' airlines to 'comply' over disputed zone . He said the China's People's Liberation Army Navy was becoming a highly professional organization and improving the way they operate and communicate -- and far from being one prone to making rash moves. ""I can tell just by our bridge-to-bridge communications that they're getting better at it. They've got a three-ship surface action group coming back from South America. They've been operating in the Gulf of Aden doing counter-piracy operations. And they're operating here in the Western Pacific all at the same time. Two years ago it was a big deal if they were able to conduct an exercise in the Philippines Sea for a week, now it's routine."" From carrier to 'lily pad' Thomas was also keen to expand on the U.S. Navy's diversity of operations, most notably their recent humanitarian mission in the Philippines after Super Typhoon Haiyan had flattened much of the eastern parts of the country. Within 48 hours, the carrier and nine other surface vessels had left Hong Kong and arrived in the Philippines Sea to begin carrying our relief operations. Combat aircraft were deliberately flown off the carrier to make room for more helicopters able to deliver badly needed assistance to areas made inaccessible by the typhoon and the subsequent storm surge. Thomas said in many cases, the U.S. Seahawk helicopters were ""first responders"" able to relay back previously unknown information about local conditions and the extent of the disaster. ""We transitioned (the carrier) into a vertical lift lily pad for the delivery of food and water supplies,"" he said. Critics may point to this being an example of Washington adopting a ""soft power"" approach politically in the region at a time when its influence is being challenged by China, though there was little doubting the pride expressed by many of the carrier's highly-trained and motivated crew in performing such a role in the Leyte Gulf. Relief effort boosts U.S. soft power in Asia region . But does serving as a deterrent or performing aid missions with hugely expensive weapons of war justify the vast cost of maintaining such an arsenal? The use of unmanned drones in other theaters illustrates that massed armies with boots on the ground, tanks and artillery are not necessarily the most effective way of dealing with terrorism or insurgencies with a minimal cost in terms of deaths to combatants. With military expansion seemingly inextricably linked to economic progress, and the exponential growth of armed forces fueled by territorial disputes in the Asia-Pacific region, the large-scale presence of this carrier strike group seems unlikely to change, though the scope of its missions will adapt to meet the increasing diversity of challenges -- both hard and soft.

"New York (CNN) -- The Egyptian cobra that turned media darling following its escape and subsequent capture at the Bronx Zoo is doing well and should return to display in a week or so, the zoo's director said Friday. The 3-ounce, 20-inch reptile slithered out of her enclosure on Saturday and turned up Thursday after zoo officials scattered rodent-scented wood shavings in a bid to lure her out in hopes of a meal. Zoo officials still don't know how the snake got out, director Jim Breheny said. ""Anyone who has ever dealt with snakes or kept snakes knows that they are notorious as escape artists,"" he said. The disappearance of an animal whose venom can kill an elephant in three hours -- and a human in 15 minutes -- sparked more amusement than panic, drawing 200,000 followers to an anonymously authored Twitter feed that had the snake taking tours of the city and threatening to drop down the chimneys of unsuspecting city dwellers. All the attention has brought plenty of notice to the zoo, Breheny said, laughing. ""It certainly has put us out there,"" he said. ""But we would have preferred to be out there for another reason."" Still, the zoo is going to make the most of it. Zoo workers will closely monitor the snake to make sure she's suffered no ill effects from her escapade, then will put her back on display so people who have been so supportive since her disappearance have a chance to see her, Breheny said. Then they plan to have a naming contest with the New York Daily News.","Recaptured cobra appears to be doing well, Bronx Zoo director says .

"Washington (CNN) -- A beloved giant panda will leave for China early next year to the disappointment of millions of fans in the United States. Washington's National Zoo will say goodbye to 4-year-old Tai Shan as he makes his way to a breeding base in southwestern China. He'll leave during the first quarter of 2010, according to the zoo and Chinese state-run media. Tai Shan -- on loan from China -- was born at the National Zoo to pandas that also are borrowed from China. His father, 11-year-old Tian Tian, and his mother, 10-year-old Mei Xiang, are due in China in December 2010, according to the Xinhua news agency. ""While we're proud to send off a healthy panda to be part of China's breeding program, we will indeed miss him dearly,"" the National Zoo's Web site said of Tai Shan. He has more growing to do, however. ""Although Tai Shan has the build of a grownup male panda, we still have to wait for about two years before it is sexually mature,"" said Li Desheng, deputy director of the management office of the Wolong National Natural Reserve in Sichuan province, according to Xinhua. Tai Shan will never be released into the wild, but there is the hope that his offspring could be, the National Zoo said. ""Since we partnered with them 10 years ago, the Chinese have more than doubled their cub production, which means they're about to reach the significant goal of having 300 pandas in captivity,"" the zoo said on its Web site. ""By reaching the target of 300 pandas, collectively we will ensure that the giant panda in captivity is demographically and genetically secure. It will be a huge conservation achievement."" The United States has 13 pandas on loan from China, according to Xinhua. The three in Washington and one each in Atlanta, Georgia, and San Diego, California, are due to return to China next year. Though Tai Shan has lived in Washington, his fans have followed him online for years, via the National Zoo's Pandacam. They've oohed and aahed as he's frolicked, had milestone exams and grown -- from less than 2 pounds at birth to more than 200 pounds at his peak weight.","Washington's National Zoo will lose panda in 2010 .

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Pennsylvania arrested a 19-year-old Russian man Friday and charged him with possession of a weapon of mass destruction, Altoona police said in a written statement. Police officers were investigating a reported marijuana-growing operation when they discovered a homemade bomb and bomb-making materials in a suitcase, the news release said. Vladislav Miftakhov, a Russian citizen, was arrested and charged with possessing a weapon of mass destruction, risking a catastrophe and drug-related offenses. He was arraigned Friday and bail was set at $500,000, Blair County corrections officer James McMahon said Sunday. According to a criminal complaint, police found one pound of atomized magnesium and one pound of Chinese potassium perchlorate along with a package labeled potassium nitrate powder. They also found fuses and several containers of compressed air. When asked what he was going to do with two devices that were found with exposed fuses, Miftakhov said ""he was going to blow things up,"" the complaint alleges. Miftakhov later said he only intended to set devices off in a field and wasn't going to blow anything up, the document says. He told police that he had previously experimented with other homemade explosives in California. Authorities found five marijuana seedlings and a grow light, the complaint says. Miftakhov will next appear in court on February 5. He will be assigned a public defender, McMahon said. The Pennsylvania State Police bomb squad ""safely deconstructed"" the device, officials said. According to the release, Miftakhov told officers that he had purchased materials for the bomb on the Internet. A man who lived in the same building told CNN affiliate WTAJ that Miftakhov was ""the weirdest individual that I've ever met,"" but Andrew Leff added that he didn't think Miftakhov had done anything dangerous before. Leff told the Altoona Mirror, which identified him as an apartment-mate, that Miftakhov had recently set off three small homemade bombs outside the apartment, leaving small craters in the ground. Another roommate, Steven Taylor, said Miftakhov was quiet. ""He barely talked,"" he told the newspaper. An independent student newspaper said the Russian native is a student at Penn State Altoona, a branch of the university about 40 miles from the main campus. The Altoona campus has about 3,645 full-time students, according to the school's website. Austin bomb an amateur job or something more insidious?

"(CNN) -- Singer and actress Eartha Kitt has died, her publicist, Patty Freedman, told CNN on Thursday. Actress Eartha Kitt, shown at a benefit for the Actors Fund in 2003, performed almost until the end of her life. Kitt, 81, died in New York, where she was being treated for colon cancer, Freedman said. Her daughter, Kitt Shapiro, was by her side. She was performing almost until the end, taping a PBS special six weeks ago in Chicago, Illinois. The show is set to air in February. The ringtone version of her recording of the saucy Christmas song ""Santa Baby"" was certified gold earlier this month. Kitt was well known for her distinctive voice and made a name for herself in her portrayal of Catwoman in the television series ""Batman."" That role produced Kitt's recognizable sultry cat growl. She worked in film, theater, cabaret, music and on television during her lengthy career. According to Kitt's official Web site, she was nominated for a Tony three times, a Grammy and Emmy twice. According to the biography on that site, Kitt lived in Connecticut near her daughter and four grandchildren. Kitt was ostracized at an early age because of her mixed-race heritage, the biography says. At age 8, she was sent from the cotton fields of South Carolina by her mother to live with her aunt in New York City's Harlem neighborhood, the site said. As a teen, she auditioned for the famed Katherine Dunham Dance Troupe, was hired as a featured dancer and vocalist, and toured worldwide with the company. This launched Kitt into a life of roles in the entertainment field. According to the book ""Contemporary Black Biography,"" she was adored in Europe in the 1950s as a cabaret singer. In the United States, her dance career led to a critically acclaimed stint on Broadway, including the play ""New Faces of 1952,"" which was later made into a movie. Broadway stardom landed Kitt a recording deal that led to a string of best-selling records, including ""Love for Sale,"" ""I Want to Be Evil,"" ""Santa Baby"" and ""Folk Tales of the Tribes of Africa."" She recorded more than 20 albums, worked in hundreds of television and movie roles, and was invited as a guest to the White House several times.

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Sporadic heavy artillery barrages and machine gun fire could be heard early Sunday on the outskirts of the southeastern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, raising questions about the viability of a ceasefire between the Ukrainian government and pro-Russian separatists. While the source of the weapons fire was not immediately clear, it came as the ceasefire appeared to be holding, a rare positive sign in a conflict that has ratcheted up tensions between Russia and the West. By late Saturday, however, bursts of heavy artillery and machine gun fire replaced the evident calm, a gas station was ablaze and cars carrying injured civilians could be seen on the roads. The warring factions blamed each other for violating the truce. The Russian news agency Itar-Tass late Saturday quoted rebel officials saying that Ukrainian forces continued to shell Donetsk and rebel positions near Mariupol. The RIA Novosti new agency reported that four Donetsk residents were killed in the shelling. Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council spokesman Col. Andriy Lysenko told reporters in Kiev on Saturday that the situation was calmer than before but that there had been a number of ""provocations"" by rebels. These include 10 instances of shelling in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, he said. But Lysenko said a prisoner exchange would begin soon without specifying a time and date. Amnesty International, meanwhile, accused Ukrainian militia and separatists of carrying out war crimes. It singled out Russia for a buildup of armor and artillery in eastern Ukraine. ""All sides in this conflict have shown disregard for civilian lives and are blatantly violating their international obligations,"" said Salil Shetty, Amnesty International's secretary general, who will travel to Kiev and Moscow in the coming days. ""Our evidence shows that Russia is fueling the conflict, both through direct interference and by supporting the separatists in the East,"" Shetty added. ""Russia must stop the steady flow of weapons and other support to an insurgent force heavily implicated in gross human rights violations."" Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian rebels have battled in eastern Ukraine since April, leaving more than 2,200 people dead, according to the United Nations. A truce deal signed Friday after talks in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, went into effect that evening. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had a phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin after the signing of the deal in the Belarusian city of Minsk, Poroshenko's office said Saturday in a statement. The leaders agreed that the ceasefire in eastern Ukraine has been mostly upheld and they discussed further steps to make the truce last, the office said. After roughly five months of bitter fighting between Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian rebel groups, the question is whether the ceasefire will last. Artillery fire and explosions were heard in the flashpoint city of Donetsk around the time the ceasefire went into effect, the city's website said. But there have been no subsequent reports of major incidents. A CNN team in southeastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces and the rebels have engaged in fierce fighting this week between the Ukrainian border town of Novoazovsk and Mariupol, said that artillery fire appeared to have stopped after the start of the truce. Despite the ceasefire deal, Putin remains under international pressure over Russia's actions in Ukraine. Hours after the guns stopped firing, EU leaders meeting in Brussels, Belgium, agreed on a new round of economic sanctions against Russian interests. They are due to be formally adopted on Monday. Russia's Foreign Ministry warned Saturday that if new EU sanctions are imposed, Russia ""certainly will respond,"" Russian state-run news agency Itar-Tass reported. Obama expresses support for Ukraine . U.S. President Barack Obama said he was hopeful but skeptical that the ceasefire would hold, questioning whether pro-Russian rebels would adhere to it. Obama, speaking at the end of a NATO summit in Wales, added that NATO was ""fully united in support of Ukraine's sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and ability to defend itself."" Member nations would send nonlethal military aid and help modernize Ukraine's security forces, while the United States and European allies finalize measures ""to deepen and broaden sanctions"" against Russia, he said. The Ukrainian government and the West accuse Moscow of backing the rebels with arms and troops -- claims that Moscow has repeatedly denied. The conflict has sparked a humanitarian crisis in eastern Ukraine, where homes and infrastructure have been destroyed by shelling. Nationwide, more than a million people have been displaced from their homes by the fighting, most of them in the east. Luhansk city council said that Saturday was the first day in over a month with no shooting. The city office has started working on repairs to the power and water supply. Russia has contacted the International Committee of the Red Cross to express its readiness to deliver a second aid convoy to Ukraine, state news agency RIA Novosti reported Saturday, quoting Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov. ""We are now discussing the practical details of this operation and expect it to be accomplished,"" Gatilov is quoted as saying. Gatilov said he could not discuss details but that this time humanitarian aid would be delivered by railroad. The last Russian aid convoy, which entered without Ukraine's permission, was sent by road. Ukraine ready for 'significant steps' Poroshenko said the ceasefire deal was based on his peace plan and an agreement reached in a phone call this week with Putin. ""We are ready to provide significant steps, including the decentralization of power,"" he said, as well as greater economic freedoms for the Luhansk and Donetsk regions and guarantees that their culture and language be respected. Many people in eastern Ukraine are Russian speakers. Poroshenko said the exchange of ""hostages,"" or prisoners, could begin as soon as Saturday. He said he hoped the ceasefire, based on a 12-point plan, would lead to more substantial talks on core issues and a lasting peace. The talks in Minsk brought together the leaders of the separatist groups with former Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma, as well as Russia's Ukrainian envoy. The ceasefire, however, does not mean the end of the self-styled Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic, separatist leaders said at a televised news conference after signing the deal. Poroshenko has asked his foreign minister and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which already has international observers in Ukraine, to monitor compliance with the ceasefire. A previous unilateral ceasefire declared by the Ukrainian government in June broke down after 10 days. New sanctions planned . Amid skepticism over Russia's intentions, the European Union agreed a fresh round of sanctions Friday against Russian interests, though they are not yet in force. The package includes ""enhanced measures related to access to capital markets, defense, dual use goods, and sensitive technologies,"" an EU statement said. It also includes sanctions against the rebel leadership in eastern Ukraine, the government of Crimea, annexed by Russia in March, and Russian decision makers and oligarchs, it said. EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton welcomed the ceasefire, adding that it must now be respected by all sides. ""We hope that this will be a first step toward a sustainable political solution, based on respect for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" she said. ""Permanent monitoring of the Russian-Ukrainian border and withdrawal of illegal armed groups and forces illegally operating on Ukrainian territory should be integral parts of such a solution."" British Prime Minister David Cameron, who hosted the NATO summit in Wales, said in his final remarks that what Putin was doing is ""indefensible and wrong"" and that Russia should face further economic costs. Western countries in July stepped up targeted sanctions against Russia, prompting a retaliatory ban by Moscow on certain imports. Putin has voiced sympathy for the separatists, many of whom are ethnic Russians. But he denies that Russia has armed and trained the rebels, or sent Russian troops over the border.

"(CNN) -- Warning: This article contains potential spoilers for the upcoming issue of ""Batman."" He's one of the most famous villains in pop culture for a reason. The Joker, Batman's archenemy, has been terrorizing the Dark Knight and his allies over these past few months in a number of ""Batman"" comic books, and it's all coming to a head in Wednesday's issue of ""Batman"" #17 (published by DC Comics, which is owned by Time Warner, as is CNN). The book's writer, Scott Snyder, promises an ending that is sure to shock Bat-fans to their cores. The crossover story's title, ""Death of the Family,"" recalls a 25-year-old story -- called ""A Death in the Family"" -- in which the second Robin, Jason Todd, was brutally murdered by The Joker (after a poll in which fans voted by phone as to whether the Boy Wonder should live or die). Snyder is mum as to whether Batman and all of his friends will survive this encounter with the Clown Prince of Crime, but he did speak to CNN.com about what readers can expect. CNN: What themes did you aim to explore with ""Death of the Family?"" Scott Snyder: The story came to me after I had my second kid. You sometimes wish that you didn't have to worry about your kids all the time. Batman has all these allies, this ""family."" Bruce Wayne has to sometimes wish that he wouldn't have to worry about Robin, Nightwing or Batgirl. Who to take that wish and twist it into a nightmare but The Joker? He says, ""I will take care of that, I will kill them."" Batman would say he never wished for that. The Joker would tell Batman, ""Yes, you wished that, you just don't want to admit it."" The Joker in this story is a devil's tongue. He makes you frightened of yourself, which the best villains in literature do. For my story, The Joker sees himself as serving Batman. Historically, the court jester was the only one who could deliver terrible news to the king. He sees Batman as this wonderfully twisted Bat-king. He sees himself as making him a tougher, stronger king. He sees Batman as deep down wanting to be the protector of Gotham, but his allies are his ""false court."" CNN: Aside from the reference to ""A Death in the Family,"" what is the meaning of the title? Snyder: We wanted it to echo that horrible moment in Batman's life. We wanted Joker for the first time ever to come after the Batman family with this murderous mission in mind. He usually does it to get at Batman. He says he's coming after them to bring out Batman's worst nightmare for the first time ever. This is The Joker's war on Batman and even more so, on his family. CNN: Why the changes to The Joker's appearance? Snyder: The way he looks now came about in ""Detective Comics"" #1 (in 2011). The writer on that book, Tony S. Daniel, wanted to take The Joker outside of Gotham for a while, to create new bad guys. We thought that would be a great place in which to leave him. We decided this would work thematically for this story. In ""Batman"" #17 you'll learn why he did it, why he had his face cut off and strapped back on. This final issue will bring everything crashing down. CNN: Why is Joker such a threat? What is his biggest weakness? Snyder: The Joker is my favorite villain in literature in general. My folks have embarrassing Halloween pictures of me dressed as The Joker. Down at its core, he's scary in and of himself. Clowns are scary, but he's physically scary and capable of doing horrifying things. He scares Batman about himself. He makes Batman afraid there's a hint of madness in him. He tries to make Batman believe the madness is true. ""You're as crazy as me, you belong in Arkham."" He feels that Batman deep down wants this to happen. Exposing the scariest things about ourselves, the scariest things we have in our hearts, and to laugh at them -- in its purest and most vicious form, that's what a great and monstrous villain does. His weakness is he doesn't see things coming outside of Batman. If Batman didn't care and didn't look for him, it would hurt The Joker in a way he's not expecting. It's a vicious cycle. There's an Achilles heel in his own obsession with Batman. CNN: Does any villain come in second to The Joker in your mind? Snyder: Each one represents a different weakness or fear Batman has for himself. The Riddler -- who I'm about to use in a big way in 2013 -- is a manifestation of Batman's fear that he's not smart enough, he's not able to solve the puzzle in time to save the city. Riddler keeps him as sharp as he can be. All of these villains figure in ""Batman"" #16 and #17 too. Joker sees them representing some facet of Batman's psychology. Two-Face is kind of the nightmare of Batman's life. Will you become this horrifying version of yourself, like Two-Face? Each represents some deep fear in the rich and complicated personality that is Bruce Wayne. Riddler, Two-Face, Ivy -- all of these characters will figure into Batman in the coming year. CNN: So how big and dramatic is this finale? How much of an impact will it have on Batman and DC Comics' current universe? Snyder: It has a big impact on the whole mythology of Batman, and certainly with the stories coming afterward, it will have a big effect on many of the books -- emotional and lasting effects I don't want to give away. CNN: It feels like the stakes are being raised in superhero comics more and more in recent years, with more dramatic changes. Why do you think this is? Snyder: It's not so much to make the books as dramatic as possible or to be shocking, but to try to tell the best story you can that feels organic. It's not been a marching order. (My editors) say, write this character as if you had just one chance to write him; proceed that way. What if I had these six issues, what would I do to tell this story? It's exciting to have that opportunity.","""Batman"" #17 arrives this week and wraps up a surprising storyline .

"(CNN) -- Last year we published a list of quintessential Americana experiences. You can find it here. They weren't necessarily the most patriotic, obvious or agreeable choices. NASCAR, bourbon, state fairs, Vegas, what's not to love? Apparently, plenty. There was scandal. There was outrage. There was name calling. Because we're gluttons for punishment -- or maybe just because we think we actually can please all of the people all of the time -- we're back for round two. Here's our Volume II of the most authentically American experiences this country has to offer. 1. Seaside boardwalks . Boardwalks have been enhancing beachside amusement since long before the Drifters' released their classic ""Under the Boardwalk"" in 1964. The first boardwalk was built in Atlantic City in 1870, when a railroad conductor was asked to find a way to prevent sand from filling shorefront hotel entryways. The innovation remains America's favorite wooden path, showing up everywhere from Monopoly, which was inspired by ""America's Favorite Playground,"" to the HBO series ""Boardwalk Empire,"" which takes place in Prohibition-era Atlantic City. Of course, you don't have to travel to Jersey to experience the joy of a lumber-pathed stroll; there are more than 60 boardwalks split between America's coasts. Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, includes roller coasters, carnival attractions, Nathan's Famous hot dogs and other slices of Americana. Out West, the Venice Boardwalk in California offers bodybuilders, artists, trinket sellers, magicians and boutique shops a place to be seen. 2. Pueblos and powwows . One of the most inspiring American experiences is witnessing the culture of the first Americans come alive in a spectacle of swirling, pulsing color. Every April, approximately 3,000 Native American dancers and singers from roughly 700 tribes come together in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to compete and celebrate their heritage. The teams blend traditional style with modern, innovative techniques, so the result is more than just living history, it's the evolution of a culture that most Americans think has all but died away. In the same area are many pueblo sites that provide tours of cave dwellings and indigenous architecture. Perhaps the most memorable is Taos Pueblo, 2Â½ hours northwest of Albuquerque. This village of adobe buildings has been continually occupied by Native Americans for more than a thousand years. Taos Pueblo, 120 Veterans Highway, Taos, New Mexico; open 8 a.m.-4:30 p.m.; closed for about 10 weeks in late winter and early spring; $10 for adults; 575-758-1028 . Gathering of Nations, University of New Mexico Arena, Avenida Cesar Chavez, Albuquerque, New Mexico; 505-836-2810 . 3. Wrigley Field, Chicago . Forget national pastime -- to some Americans, baseball is a national religion. Wrigley Field in Chicago, regardless of denomination, is their Vatican. Boston's Fenway Park has two years on Wrigley (the former was built in 1912), but Fenway has had more significant updates. Like a giant video display installed in 2000, and extra seats and luxury boxes that have been added time and time again. By contrast, Wrigley has remained fairly true to its roots. It's a classic jewel box design -- green seats, open roof, exposed steel, brick, stone -- with ball-swallowing ivy-covered walls. There's truly no better place to watch a game if you want a direct link to nearly a century of baseball history. If you're in Chicago during the off-season, no worries. The park provides 90-minute tours year-round. Wrigley Field, 1060 W. Addison St., Chicago; tours $24 for individuals; 773-388-8270 . 4. College football, anywhere (though Alabama ain't bad) Let's not kid ourselves. Football is the true national sport of the 21st century. While it doesn't get much more American than the Super Bowl, we'd argue that the most enjoyable, purest way to experience the unique American-branded mixture of militant strategics, refined athleticism, brute force and exploitation of young labor is at a college football game. Best to get there early enough to tailgate. Bonding with strangers, drinking and grilling beforehand is 72.4% of the experience. Pretty much any stadium will do, but a game experience doesn't get much better than at Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, home of the reigning national champion Alabama Crimson Tide. (Yes, we know, the barbecue is spicier and the cheerleaders are hotter at your team's stadium, but we had to draw the line somewhere and ""national champs"" earns you the top spot on lists like this.) Bryant-Denny Stadium, 920 Paul W. Bryant Dr., Tuscaloosa, Alabama. 5. Kentucky Derby . There's one more sporting event we have to include on the list. Sure, other countries have their horse races. But those competitions weren't founded by the grandson of William Clark of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Also, those races don't have a traditional drink made of bourbon (mint julep), nor do they encourage everyone to dress like a flamboyant Southern aristocrat. We're talking bow ties, seersucker, bold pastels and spectacular hats that put British royal wedding attendees to shame. Churchill Downs, 700 Central Ave., Louisville, Kentucky.; May 3-4, 2013; single day general admission $25-40; 502-636-4400 . 6. Burning Man . The first Woodstock Music & Art Fair in 1969 was one of the most pivotal moments in American cultural history. Five-hundred-thousand people came together to celebrate drugs, weirdness, creativity, individualism, beauty and sticking it to the Man. What's the direct descendant of Woodstock? Before you say Bonnaroo, Coachella, Lollapalooza or any other trendy music festival -- each of which is run by the Man -- let us stop you. The world's largest festival of artistic expression is Burning Man. The weeklong event held every year in the Black Rock Desert of northern Nevada is difficult to describe. As the website puts it, describing Burning Man is ""like trying to explain what a particular color looks like to someone who is blind."" Essentially 50,000 creative spirits gather in one of the most desolate areas in the continental United States to wear bizarre clothes, make art, do drugs, experience a new form of communal living, have a hell of a lot of fun and let their freak flags fly. Burning Man; August 26-September 2, 2013; 415-863-5263 . 7. Soul food . It's difficult to pin down the most American of foods. Almost every candidate has roots in other countries, but, of course, that's what makes them American. Soul food makes the top of the list because it's delicious, unapologetically artery-clogging and it brings us face to face with our turbulent past. African-American slaves on Southern plantations were often given scraps and leftovers to eat, and had to make do with whatever vegetables they could grow nearby and with little care, as so much time was spent working. From these restrictions arose some of the finest recipes in American cuisine. There are thousands of spectacular soul food restaurants -- many of the best are in the South -- but Sylvia's in New York is maybe the most well known. Sylvia's, 328 Lenox Ave., New York; 212-996-0660 . 8. Juke joints . While we're in the region, one of America's great art forms, Blues music, grew up in the juke joints of the South. Jukes arose after emancipation, taking the form of shacks and private houses where African-Americans gathered to listen to and play music, gamble and dance. A few classic juke joints still remain, some along Highway 61, aka the Blues Highway, which stretches from New Orleans to the town of Wyoming, Minnesota, an American experience in and of itself. Po' Monkey's, opened in 1963 outside Merigold, Mississippi, is considered one of the last remaining original jukes. It's only open Thursdays, and it's not easy to get to, but the music and crowd make it worth the trip. Po' Monkey's; Po Monkey Road, Merigold, Mississippi; 662-843-2712 . 9. Outdoor Christmas light displays . Sure, other countries have Christmas lights (or fairy lights, in the UK), but no one else takes it quite as seriously as Americans. The lighting of the approximately 80-foot tall Norwood spruce at Rockefeller Center in New York is practically a national event. But the greatest displays of holiday spirit can be seen in more rural areas. Take Magical Night of Lights in Lake Lanier, Georgia, which consists of seven miles and millions of lights, or the six-mile long Oglebay Winter Festival of Lights in Wheeling, West Virginia.

Megachurches . Americans know how to make praising Jesus memorable. Just look at Gospel music and tent revivals. In modern times you needn't look much further than Gospel brunches (wash away your sins from the night before with spiritual songs and mimosas) and megachurches. Those giant boxes of worship are where thousands of Christians gather not simply to pray and praise, but in many cases to eat, shop and work out. The United States has more than 1,300 of them, and more than 50 draw a weekly attendance between 10,000 and 45,000. The mega-ist of American megachurches is Lakewood Church in Houston, led by senior pastor Joel Osteen. Every week his message is broadcast to 7 million viewers in more than 100 countries.

"(CNN) -- Four years ago, lobster fisherman Gary Nichols had never laid eyes on a lionfish, but today his traps are full of them. ""You'll get two or three decent traps with lobster, but if you get four or five lionfish, the lobster don't like it,"" Nichols said. He says he catches so many lionfish now (up to 200 pounds every day) that he's started to sell them. But where his lobsters sell for $16 per kilogram, lionfish only make him $12. Lionfish are causing a huge strain on his business and the wider commercial fishing industry in Florida, devouring other fish populations -- in some cases reducing them by up to 90%. According to the Florida's Department for Environmental Protection, lionfish are native to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, but were accidentally introduced into Atlantic and Caribbean waters during the 1990s. With no natural predators in the Atlantic and an ability to reproduce year-round, their numbers have risen unabated in recent years. Not only are lionfish causing grief for lobster fishermen like Nichols, they are also threatening to upset the balance of the fragile reef ecosystem. ""What we've found through stomach analysis and working with fish that have been collected is that they are consuming a wide variety of prey,"" said Lad Akins, director of special projects for REEF, a marine conservation group. ""They are eating almost anything that fits in their mouth. The lionfish can probably consume in excess of half of its own body size. They can take quite large prey,"" he added. Some of what they eat are commercially valuable species, says Akins, like juvenile grouper and snapper that the fishermen depend on. Ecologically important species like mudfish which graze on algae, stopping it growing over the reefs, are also being impacted, he says. ""I'm an optimist but potential impacts of lionfish could result in major shifts in the ecology of our Caribbean and West Atlantic reef barriers,"" Akins said. ""It could result in the extinction of some fish species."" In an effort to minimize their impact, REEF run a monthly contest, open to both businesses and individuals, awarding prizes to those who catch the most lionfish. It also run workshops educating divers about safe collection and removal techniques. The U.S.'s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has also joined the fight with a campaign that encourages people to eat lionfish. Its ""If we can't beat them, let's eat them!"" slogan has been taken up by restaurants like the Fish House Encore in Key Largo. General manager Michelle Kosiek has been serving lionfish for the past 18 months. ""We're putting it on the menu to try to get them off the reef and try to get people to actually like them and enjoy them,"" Kosiek said. ""There is a little bit of fear factor eating them. But once they know that the flesh has no poison, they're ok with it and want to try it."" By encouraging more people to eat lionfish, Kosiek hopes to entice fishermen to get them out of the ocean. Once cooked, the venomous spines are harmless and Peter Tselikis, chef at Field House Encore, says the response from customers has been very encouraging. ""In the beginning it was sort of more like a novelty. But those who tried it have spoken well of it,"" Tselikis said. Nichols, who has spent over a quarter of a century fishing the waters off Florida, remains philosophical about the threat, speculating it could be cyclical and that nature usually finds a way to adapt. ""Maybe it's just taking its time,"" he said. ""But it's really strange. I mean, having fished all my life, it's just hard to believe that in a short space of time something like this can happen.""","Florida fisherman struggling to cope with an influx of lionfish in recent years .

"(CNN) -- The next time you're sweating and complaining that this summer is just too hot, consider this fun fact in weather world history: Exactly 100 years ago this week, Death Valley National Park set the hottest temperature ever recorded in the world -- 134 degrees Fahrenheit. At least 140 people showed up to celebrate the anniversary and listen to weather experts discuss the record at Furnace Creek Visitor Center and Museum in the expanse of eastern California desert. ""I was really happy looking out in that auditorium as we spoke. There were a lot of weather tourists who are very interested in this,"" said Randy Cerveny, professor of geographical sciences at Arizona State University. He's with the World Meteorological Organization that made the determination that 134 was the world record. Temperatures in Death Valley normally reach or exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit from mid-May until early October, according to the National Weather Service. Yet tourists still visit the area during this time, and there's even one of the hardest foot races in the world staged there every summer called the Badwater Ultramarathon. When CNN spoke with Cerveny Wednesday night around 10:40 p.m. ET, the National Weather Service said that the temps would hover between 94 and 97 at Furnace Creek. While Death Valley's July 10, 1913, recorded temperature now is considered the hottest ever, on September 13, 1922, a temperature reading of 136 degrees was recorded in El Azizia, Libya. Though the Libya recording had been certified by the World Meteorological Organization as the hottest air temperature ever recorded, evidence about Libya's record later suggested that it was invalid. Cerveny said that a member of the WMO had managed to obtain handwritten records that indicated there might have been a wrong recording taken. An investigating committee including experts from Libya, Italy, Spain, Egypt, France, Morocco, Argentina, the United States and the United Kingdom looked into the matter between 2010 and 2011 and decided that El Azizia's recording was flawed for possibly several reasons, including problematic instrumentation and probably an inexperienced observer, according to Cerveny and the World Meteorological Organization. On September 12, 2012, the WMO officially recertified the 134 reading at Death Valley as the all-time highest air temperature taken on the planet. Though 134 degrees may seem incomprehensible, the U.S. southwest has been grappling in recent days with scorching temperatures. Nevada, California and Arizona were choked by extreme heat through the July Fourth holiday. The Southwest heat wave made June the hottest month on record for Las Vegas, Death Valley, and Needles, California, the National Weather Service said. Could Death Valley break its own record, CNN asked Cerveny. ""Oh, yes, we've been seeing so many records broken lately,"" he said, ""and if that one is broken ... I wouldn't be surprised at all."" CNN's Chandler Friedman contributed to this report.","On July 10, 1913, Death Valley recorded the hottest known temperature -- 134 degrees .

"(CNN) -- Officials in Michigan Thursday urged residents living near the Kalamazoo River oil spill to evacuate the area because of health concerns. Between 30 and 50 homes are thought to be affected by the request, which was made by the Calhoun County Public Health Department. The Environmental Protection Agency indicated Thursday the spill is largely contained. Oil leaked Monday from a 30-inch pipeline, owned by Enbridge Energy Partners -- moving from Talmadge Creek into the Kalamazoo River, which flows from near the city of Battle Creek into Lake Michigan. The pipeline normally carries 190,000 barrels of oil per day from Griffith, Indiana, to Sarnia, Ontario. The leak was stopped Tuesday, but not before an estimated 19,500 barrels of oil slipped out. The cause of the spill is under investigation. ""The Health Department is recommending evacuation due to the higher-than-acceptable levels of benzene found in air quality tests and the adverse long-term affect associated with exposure,"" officials said in a statement. Benzene can cause drowsiness, dizziness, rapid or irregular heartbeat, headaches, tremors, confusion, or unconsciousness, the department said. Health officials have advised residents to stay away from oil fumes and to avoid the spill site. The spill covers 25 miles and resources will be put in full force to prevent it from contaminating Morrow Lake and Lake Michigan, Environmental Protection Agency's Ralph Dollhopf said Thursday. ""We don't anticipate (the spill) getting beyond the containment it already has,"" Dollhopf. Enbridge said that 2,400 barrels of oil have been recovered and pumped into large tanks by noon Thursday. An additional 10,000 barrels of oil have been isolated into a holding area and will be pumped into holding tanks, the company said. Enbridge and the EPA doubled their resources in their bid to contain and clean up the spill and crews were busy along the river Thursday. Mark Durno, the EPA's deputy incident commander for the site, said that the oil hadn't reached the popular Morrow Lake, between Battle Creek and the city of Kalamazoo, and that holding the oil back from the lake will be ""the last line of defense."" Tom Sands, a Michigan state police captain overseeing Michigan's emergency response, said he saw an oil sheen on the lake. He also said containment efforts were falling short. He said he perused the area the day before and said more collections sites were needed. ""This is a serious situation and we need more resources to that area,"" Sands said. The action came a day after Gov. Jennifer Granholm demanded a large response to the spill, which was estimated at 19,500 barrels of oil. Enbridge Energy Partners stopped the leak from its pipeline and is committed to cleaning up the oil, its CEO said Wednesday. ""Our intent is to return your community and the waterways to its original state,"" Patrick Daniel said at a news conference in Battle Creek, Michigan. ""We've made significant progress since yesterday. We still have a lot of work to do."" The company set up a website (www.response.enbridgeus.com) and a toll-free number (800-306-6837) for residents and volunteers. A Calhoun County Health Department water advisory was issued for anyone with an underground well within 200 feet of the river's banks as a precaution until the water quality can be evaluated, Health Officer Jim Rutherford said at a news conference Thursday. Bottled water will be available for affected residents, which is approximately 100 households.","NEW: The EPA says the spill is largely contained .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A birthday ""cake"" made of ice, beets, apples and pears? It might not sound appetizing, but it was a special treat Thursday for Tai Shan, the Smithsonian National Zoo's giant panda. Giant panda Tai Shan digs into his special birthday cake of ice, beets, apples and pears. A huge group of fans watched as the popular panda celebrated his fourth birthday with the three-tier cake. They cheered him on as he inched closer to the treat, and one woman yelled ""Atta boy Tai Shan!"" when he finally started eating the apple pieces on the cake's lowest tier. She cheered the panda on for eating his ""cake"" the same way a mom might cheer on her son at a soccer game or dad might cheer his daughter playing basketball. Zoo curator Lisa Stevens said people react that way because of how pandas resemble children. ""They share many features of infants and toddlers. They have high foreheads, big eye spots, and they can sit up straight and grip and eat their food,"" Stevens said. Pandas are also known to give hope to the downtrodden, according to one loyal Tai Shan fan who called herself ""Sandy."" During her battle against a medical condition that caused her to be unable to walk, she said that frequent visits to the zoo to see Tai Shan gave her the strength she needed to persevere through the pain. ""I could barely stand an hour to see him, now I could stand all day to watch him. I pushed myself for him ... he's done so much for me and for people all over the world,"" she said. Tai Shan was born at the zoo and has had his entire life documented on a Web cam for the whole world to see. Fans may have little time left to enjoy Tai Shan, as the zoo's contract with the China Wildlife Conservation Association to keep him is set to expire later this year. The zoo is negotiating with the conservation association to keep Tai Shan a few months longer.","Tai Shan was born at the Smithsonian National Zoo .

"(CNN) -- A Texas woman vanished without a trace after visiting friends in Plano over Labor Day weekend, police said. Now her family and friends are desperately trying to find out what happened to Christina Marie Morris. Morris, 23, lives in Fort Worth but was visiting friends in Plano, about 50 miles away, when she disappeared on August 30, according to her family. Relatives reported her missing on Tuesday night, four days after she was last seen. Morris' parents filed a missing persons report on their daughter late Tuesday, according to police. Morris was last seen by a friend, who walked her to a parking garage at the Shops at Legacy mall just before 4 a.m., but he did not walk her all the way to her car, police said. She appears on surveillance video walking into the parking garage with the friend, police said. ""The guy ... is a friend of hers from high school. They had been at a friend's apartment hanging out and walked back together,"" Plano police spokesman David Tilley said Saturday. Police later found Morris' vehicle in the parking garage, but there was no sign of the woman. Her mother, Jonni McElroy, visited stores at the mall this week, desperately looking for anyone who may have seen Morris before she disappeared, CNN affiliate WFAA-TV reported. ""I'm not leaving. I will not leave here until I find clues to find my daughter,"" she told WFAA. Family and friends on Friday night also retraced Morris' steps, hoping to find answers to her whereabouts, the station said. Police said Morris' cell phone is either dead or turned off. ""We have been able to track the phone's last known location and that was in the Shops at Legacy,"" Tilley said. Her boyfriend, Hunter Foster, put out a plea on his Facebook page this week asking for help finding Morris. ""I'm worried sick and will do anything to get any information on the last time anyone has seen or talked to her please help and pray that she is ok,"" he said in a posting Tuesday. ""Police are involved and we are going to find her and whoever has taken her or whoever she is with."" Plano authorities are asking for the public's help in locating Morris, who is described as 5 feet 4 inches tall, with blond hair and brown eyes, weighing 100 pounds. Anyone with information is asked to call police at 972-424-5678.","Christina Marie Morris vanished in Plano, Texas, over Labor Day weekend .

"(CNN) -- An Australian politician suffered gashes to one of his legs when a close encounter with a kangaroo during his morning jog turned violent. Shane Rattenbury, a minister for the local government that manages the territory around the Australian capital, Canberra, said he bumped into the animal early Thursday as he was running along the side of a hedge in a suburban neighborhood. ""I didn't see the kangaroo, and it didn't see me,"" he said by phone on Friday. ""It started hopping around, it was a bit panicked. I ducked for cover and ended up on the ground. The kangaroo jumped on me in its attempt to get away."" The claws on its powerful hind legs dug into the back of Rattenbury's left leg. It then bounded away in the direction of a nearby nature reserve, leaving Rattenbury lying dazed in the street with deep cuts in his leg. ""Like most animals, when frightened, they'll lash out quite hard,"" he said. Eastern Grey Kangaroos, the species he encountered, are common in the suburbs of Canberra, especially at this time of year when the dry weather brings them searching for grass and water on people's lawns. ""I see kangaroos here all the time when I'm running,"" Rattenbury said. ""But I've never actually crashed into one before."" He said that after the skirmish, he hitched a ride home and then went and got his wounds cleaned and bandaged at a walk-in medical center. A nurse also gave him a tetanus shot. His injuries didn't stop him from going on to attend a sitting of the local assembly, where some colleagues couldn't resist humoring him about his experience. ""There have certainly been a lot of kangaroo jokes and kangaroo puns in the parliament,"" he said. Australian media outlets also saw an opportunity for word play. ""A run in with a 'roo has left the municipal services minister ruing his choice of route for a morning jog,"" an anchor on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation said as she introduced Rattenbury's story. Although kangaroos don't usually pose a threat to humans, authorities in the Canberra area have undertaken annual culls to control the animals' numbers for environmental reasons. Rattenbury's political party, the Greens, doesn't oppose the policy. ""The cull has been very controversial,"" he said. ""It's undertaken on the basis of science that indicates there is an overabundance of these kangaroos in the region."" The Greens ""continue to monitor that science and look at whether this cull has delivered the desired impacts,"" he added. On Rattenbury's Facebook page, one person sought to draw a link between the program and the minister's unfortunate experience. ""Perhaps the kangaroos are trying to tell you something about the culling program,"" wrote a user named Rick Collins. It is estimated that there are around 50 million kangaroos in Australia, according to the national government. Rattenbury says his alarming experience hasn't deterred him from continuing to run in the same neighborhood as he trains for triathlons in the coming months. ""I hope to be back out there tomorrow,"" he said.","Shane Rattenbury was jogging in a suburb of Canberra when he ran into the animal .

"Batumi, Georgia (CNN) -- For Iranian tourists strolling in the sun-drenched squares in the Black Sea town of Batumi, Georgia is a pocket of hospitality in a world that has largely closed its doors to them. In Georgia, that all changed last year when the former Soviet republic lifted its visa requirements for Iranians and the tourists started flowing in. While the numbers are still modest, Georgian government statistics show a tripling of Iranian tourists so far this year with visitors now in the tens of thousands. ""When I describe the possibilities, the potential, they are very eager, and they will come, they're very interested to come more,"" says Farzin Valipour, an Iranian Tourism Operator now living in Georgia. ""Georgia is very near to Iran, it is very easy to get a bus or a flight to come here... without needing a visa,"" gushed one Iranian visitor as she took in the historical sites in Batumi. But there is more to this relationship than attracting sun-seeking tourists. ""Desperately seeking a way out of its energy and economic dependence on Russia, Georgia considers Iran as an alternative supplier of energy, and both sides have renewed their drive for an energy partnership,"" writes Kornely Kakachia of Tbilisi State University in a recent diplomatic journal. Last month, a few dozen Iranian business leaders arrived in Georgia to seek investment opportunities in transport, agriculture and construction. And as well as having an active Iranian embassy in the Georgian capital Tbilisi, Iran recently opened a consulate here in Batumi. In fact, Iran fits into Georgia's aggressive strategy to court foreign direct investment however and wherever it can. ""Interest towards our country as a place for investment and trade has been quite high. In 2012 we've already held investment seminars practically in all counties of gulf region,"" says Giorgi Tsikolia, First Deputy Director at the Georgian National Investment Agency. This is a delicate relationship though as Georgia continues to seek membership in both the EU and NATO and remains one of the strongest Western allies in the region. Neither Iran nor Georgia was eager to discuss the growing relationship beyond published statements and for good reason. Georgia does not want to be seen as skirting U.S.-sponsored sanctions against Iran. Iranian business people we spoke to here would not disclose how sanctions were handled in Georgia except to say that the sanctions pose hurdles in all countries in which they try to do business. In fact, Georgia has been a shrewd geopolitical player especially since it now believes it is no longer a U.S. policy priority in the region. ""Georgia's current policy toward Iran is not irrational. Closer relations with Iran, despite extremely tense relations between Washington and Tehran, is an indication of Tbilisi's disillusionment with what it sees as the West's weakening interest in Georgia, as well as its desire to expand its room for maneuvering, politically and economically,"" writes Kakachia. For now, the U.S. continues to claim that Iran is becoming more isolated financially and diplomatically. That may be true in many places around the world, but not here in Georgia. CNN's Eye On series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries we profile. However CNN retains full editorial control over all of its reports.","Iranians increasingly see Georgia as an attractive tourism destination .

"(CNN) -- Look, I'm not saying I'm a cheap bastard. I'm also not saying I'm a soulless ginger. Mind you, both are true. I'm just not saying it. But to the first point, it's necessary to clarify that, despite the fact I've been known to show signs of lupus over the occasional restaurant bill, I'm actually an excellent tipper. As for everything else in life, I'm mediocre at best. So, this week we're going to talk about gratuity. And it all stems from a recent trending discovery on the interwebs about something called the Dipjar. Now, I don't throw the word ""genius"" around too liberally. Generally, I save it for really important stuff like when a friend suggests we light something on fire. But I'm going to go ahead and drop a G-bomb on this amazing new invention. Because, for better or worse, when it comes to tipping, the Dipjar is an absolute game changer. Or not. I've been known to get things wrong. ""Gangnam Style"" is still around. Basically, the Dipjar is an electronic tip jar for store countertops in which a customer can -- as the name suggests -- dip his or her credit card to leave a fixed-amount tip for the clerk. And these days it's sort of a necessity . Increasingly, we are becoming a cash-free society, preferring the convenience of credit cards to carrying actual paper money. While this can be great for the consumer, it sort of screws over the hipster barista behind the counter who no longer gets to keep your change. But, hey, he still has giant-gauged ear holes. So that's something. Not only is cash becoming less popular, but it also seems that more and more credit card companies don't even require a signature for small transactions, thus eliminating the opportunity to write in a tip or, perhaps, leave that really cute server an adorable pickup line. ""I'm so alone. Hold me."" I almost never carry cash. Though, for me, it has less to do with convenience, and everything to do with racking up airline miles . I'm sort of obsessed. So much so, that when I actually go to book a flight I don't even use the miles I have. It's unquestionably because I'm a complete idiot, and figure why drop 40,000 miles to fly for free when I could spend $500 and get ... more miles? Delta pretty much has me by the gonads. But it's cool. I get to board in Zone 1. And these are the things that matter to soulless gingers. Anyway, Dipjar finally makes it easy for credit card users to tip without signing, and the company makes their money by taking a small percentage of each transaction. However, they insist that they'll always deliver at least 80 cents of every dollar to the store's employees. Some people might say this is unfairly taking money from the people who actually earned it, but the counter-argument (pun absolutely intended because I'm awesome) is that this is money they probably wouldn't have seen in the first place. I suppose there's no right answer here, but we should probably all get unnecessarily worked up and leave hateful, anonymous comments for each other. I'll start: . ""This writer sucks!"" The future, of course, is cell phones where you either tap-to-pay or maybe just command Siri to do something useful for a change. ""Siri, pay the man."" ""Where are your pants?"" ""Shut up, Siri."" But, for now, until our cell phones officially take over the world, the Dipjar seems to be a decent intermediary. That said, we still have to ask: Who actually deserves a Dipjar in the first place? These days, it seems like everyone is soliciting tips. And I legitimately don't know who should get them. Naturally, we have the old standards. Servers get 15% to 20%. Bartenders get a dollar a drink. And the guy who hooks me up with illegal HBO gets 20 bucks and a Miller Lite. But as I spoke to people this week about tipping, and as I researched the topic online, there seemed to be a huge overall backlash against leaving money for anyone with an actual tip jar. Read: People who might use the Dipjar. The general consensus was that, in food service, if you physically come to the table with my meal you get a tip. The frozen yogurt girl, on the other hand, can go die in a ditch. Of course, tipping isn't unique to America. But it certainly seems to be a bigger part of our culture than in other countries. For example, in the United States we even take care of the taxi driver in the same way we tip a restaurant server. And it's kind of insane. ""Here's an extra five bucks for talking on your blue tooth for the last 30 minutes. You're the best!"" For comparison, in England, riders tip, but only a small amount. In fact, while on assignment in London before the Royal Wedding, I actually spoke to a taxi driver about proper etiquette, and he told me it's polite to just round up the fare -- that the normal tip is about 50 pence (or roughly 80 cents). He said, ""You don't look towards a tip, but it's nice when you do get one."" The moral of the story is never leave your house. Life's too confusing. But for those who do wander and buy stuff, the Dipjar is definitely a clever idea. Still, I seriously don't know who should get a tip these days. So help me sort this out. Who's worthy? And, more importantly, has anyone seen the frozen yogurt girl?","""Apparently This Matters"" is CNN Tech's weekly, off-kilter look at the social Web .

"(CNN) -- Few things enrage normally calm people like finding a parking ticket tucked under the windshield wiper of their car. Parking tickets can be infuriating, especially when they seem undeserved. (Officer, there's no sign saying I can't park here!). But most people don't want to invest the time and energy to would take to dispute them. Now there's a new iPhone app, Fixed, that will fight parking tickets for you. The app, expected to launch next week, will do the heavy lifting of contesting a ticket: suggesting reasons it might be invalid, gathering supporting evidence and submitting the proper appeals paperwork. If the driver beats the ticket, they pay Fixed 25% of what the citation would have cost. If they can't get out of the ticket, Fixed doesn't charge them anything. In this way, Fixed hopes to add navigating bureaucracy to the list of urban tasks and nuisances -- catching a cab, ordering food, finding a place to crash -- made easier by popular tech startups. ""When you mention parking tickets to people it engenders such an emotional reaction ... because so many people think they've received an unfair parking ticket,"" said Fixed co-founder David Hegarty, who came up with the idea after getting six parking tickets in one day. Much of this anger is directed at local governments, which many people see as using parking tickets to fill budget gaps. That emotional response, as well as a desire to not shell out $100 for blocking a couple inches of someone's driveway, could make Fixed a hit. But its success will depend on how good the service is at navigating parking laws, which are often a confusing hodgepodge of local and state ordinances. Here's how Fixed works: When someone gets a ticket, they snap a photo of it on their iPhone and enter the violation code. The Fixed app will tell them what percentage of those types of tickets are usually overturned and then show a list of possible reasons it could be found invalid. For example, a street cleaning sign might be obscured by a leafy tree, or a parking meter could be broken. If the motorist thinks they have a case, the app will prompt them to capture any additional photographic evidence with their phone and then digitally sign a letter. Fixed has contracted with a team of legal researchers fluent in local traffic laws who will review each case before printing out the letter and submitting it via snail mail to the city. Over time, Fixed hopes to learn more about what methods and which errors have the highest success rates when contesting tickets. That information will be used to make the system more automated. ""It will always be reviewed by human eyes before it's sent, but I'm pretty confident that we can get to the point where 80% of tickets are 95% automated,"" said Hegarty. Fixed is expected to launch in the Apple App store next week, although its service will only be available in San Francisco at first. The startup has been testing its service with a small group of 1,000 people, mostly friends and friends of friends, and there's already a waiting list of 25,000 people wanting to sign up. Hegarty and with Fixed's other two co-founders, David Sanghera and DJ Burdick, hope to expand into the top 100 U.S. cities over the next 18 months. San Francisco is fertile ground for motorists who can effortlessly rack up hundreds of dollars in parking tickets. As in many cities, parking in San Francisco is an exercise in frustration, with a limited number of spaces on the street and parking garages charging top dollar. The company hasn't had any official talks with the city. But Hegarty hopes his service is not seen as adversarial. Rather, he thinks Fixed could help people pay their legitimate parking tickets in a more timely manner. ""We do not have concerns if people want to use a third-party service, but there is no secret to overturning a citation if it has been issued erroneously. If someone feels that their citation was written in error, they might want to consider protesting themselves, for free,"" said Paul Rose, a spokesperson for San Francisco's transportation agency. San Francisco issues about 1.5 million parking tickets every year, typically for $45 to $115 each (there are also some significantly pricier violations, such as having an expired plate or abandoning a car on a highway). The fines add up to about $95 million a year, according to Hegarty. Of those 1.5 million citations, only five percent are actually contested. And of that small amount, only 30% are actually overturned, according to Rose. There are three rounds of appeals -- two by mail and a court hearing. Fixed will only handle the first two appeals for the time being. The number of overall citations in San Francisco has fallen in recent years as the city has rolled out its own technological tools, such as pay-by-phone and meters that take credit cards, in an effort to make payment easier. ""We'd much rather have people pay the meter than pay a fine,"" said Rose. Fixed's business model isn't completely new. There are companies that handle driving and parking violations for large corporations such as FedEx and UPS. In New York City, commercial delivery companies account for 20% to 30% of the city's 10 million parking tickets every year, according to Crain's New York Business. The difference is that Fixed is making this service available to individuals. Hegarty can see eventually expanding into speeding tickets and other small financial annoyances, such as cable company fees. He thinks Fixed could help in any area where the fee amount is small enough not to protest in person, but still big enough to make someone angry. ""That's our sweet spot,"" he said.","A new app, Fixed, will contest parking tickets on a driver's behalf .
Users submit a photo of their ticket and the app handles the legal paperwork .
If Fixed gets someone out of a ticket, it charges them 25% of the ticket fine .
Fixed is rolling out in San Francisco first but hopes to expand to more cities ."
"London (CNN) -- A second case of the potentially deadly MERS virus has been identified in the Netherlands, a spokeswoman for the country's National Public Health Institute told CNN. It comes one day after authorities confirmed the first case. The cases in the Netherlands involve two family members who had traveled together to Saudi Arabia. It is one man and one woman who contracted the disease, said Harald Wychgel, spokesman for the Netherlands ministry of health. The health ministry, citing privacy reasons, did not provide additional details except to say that the pair shared a room for two weeks in Saudi Arabia. Officials do not know if one person infected the other or if both became infected at the same location. One of the two, however, had visited a camel farm. It is estimated that nearly 75% of dromedary -- or single-hump camels -- in Saudi Arabia have come into contact with the MERS virus, researchers said in February. ""It is also known that both patients have underlying conditions that make them probably more susceptible to infection with this virus,"" the health ministry said in a statement. The announcement comes as the World Health Organization said the spread of the virus has become more urgent, but at least for now, is not calling it a global health emergency. The first cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome were diagnosed in the Arabian Peninsula in 2012. MERS attacks the respiratory system, and symptoms can lead to pneumonia or kidney failure. There have been over 570 confirmed cases of MERS, including 171 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Many of the cases are in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Even without any official worldwide alert, Anne Schuchat, the head of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, acknowledges that ""this is a relatively new virus that does have a high fatality rate,"" ample reason to pay attention. Authorities haven't pinned down all the details about how exactly it arose and how it spreads, though Schuchat said, ""We don't have evidence right now that this is airborne ... the way the measles virus is."" Two cases have been confirmed in the United States. Both patients are health care providers who were working in Saudi Arabia. Those cases are in Indiana and Florida.

"New York (CNN) -- A peacock that had escaped from the Central Park Zoo returned home on its own Wednesday morning, the Wildlife Conservation Society told CNN. The peacock flew home at 6:45 a.m. and was safe, the society said. ""We have recovered the peacock as anticipated this morning when it flew home at sunrise back into the Central Park Zoo,"" Zoo Director Jeff Sailer said. ""A thorough understanding of the peacock's natural behavior allowed for the successful planning of its recovery."" The peacock wandered from the zoo in Manhattan on Tuesday, said Mary Dixon, society spokeswoman. The bird made its way to a Fifth Avenue apartment building near the park and perched on a third-floor windowsill, but it wasn't there on Wednesday morning. Zoo officials had encouraged onlookers to avoid following or harassing the peacock. They say the runaway posed no danger to the public. Zoo officials did not say how the bird escaped or what type of enclosure he was in. According to the zoo's website, peafowl are kept in the Tisch Children's zoo, which is described as a ""walk-through wildlife adventure."" The notorious peacock drummed up more than 340 followers on its @CentralPeacock Twitter feed. The Central Park escapee comes after a peahen -- the female counterpart to a peacock -- fled the Bronx Zoo in May. In March, a cobra disappeared from its Bronx Zoo pen for five days.","The peacock returned on its own to the Central Park Zoo early Wednesday .

"Washington (CNN) -- In President Barack Obama's two presidential campaigns, his predecessor loomed large; Obama and Democrats regularly laid the blame for the downtrodden economy at George W. Bush's feet. When pressed on their pledge to turn the faltering economy around, Obama and Democrats often pointed out that they had inherited the product of the Bush administration's policies. Bush, however, in his limited public appearances has stayed mute about his successor, maintaining a custom among former presidents that dates back decades. While not all presidents have adhered to the practice, it has created a mostly amicable brotherhood of former presidents. ""George W. Bush is a traditionalist,"" CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen said. ""I think he holds to an old-fashioned standard that the presidency is one of the world's greatest fraternities and its members don't criticize each other."" After leaving the White House, Bush made it clear that he was finished with the public stage. Although he has been more public since his presidential library opened in April, Bush has maintained that he will not criticize Obama. ""I don't think it does any good,"" Bush said Monday in an exclusive interview with CNN's Robyn Curnow in Zambia, where he was helping to renovate a women's clinic. ""It's a hard job. He's got plenty on his agenda. It's difficult. A former president doesn't need to make it any harder. Other presidents have taken different decisions; that's mine."" Bush's new mission: Helping those with the least . In ""The Presidents Club,"" a book by Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy about the fraternity, a Bush adviser says the most the former president will say about Obama's decisions is, ""Well, I might have done it differently."" In public, though, Bush has refused to comment on Obama. ""He deserves my silence,"" Bush said in a March 2009 speech. ""There's plenty of critics in the arena. I think it's time for the ex-president to tap dance off the stage and let the current president have a go at solving the world's problems."" CNN Exclusive: George W. Bush interview . Unexpected friendships . Gergen said he feels Bush's silence about Obama stems from how Bush was treated in his last few years in office. ""There was a sense among the Bush people that a lot of this criticism was gratuitous and ill-informed and painful,"" Gergen said. That could be ""part of his staying away from issues with Obama."" When you are president, there are literally only a handful of people in the world who can relate to the pressure, the commitment, the arduous decision making. This unique understanding has led many presidents to rely on one another after leaving office. Former, current presidents on George W. Bush . Some of these relationships have led to unexpected political friendships. Despite the fact they faced off in the 1992 presidential election, the relationship of Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush has been described as father-and-son-like. They are so close that Clinton joked at the opening of George W. Bush's library that he ""had become the black sheep son"" of the Bush family. 5 presidents on hand for Bush Center opening . He even jokingly referred to former first lady Barbara Bush as his ""mother."" Clinton praises Bush at library opening . Other presidential relationships have been similarly close. Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, opponents in the 1976 election, grew close in their retirement and worked together on a number of international issues. President Harry Truman also befriended a predecessor, Herbert Hoover. After working together to restructure the executive branch, Truman called Hoover ""the best man that I know of"" and an appreciative Hoover wrote Truman to say, ""For all of this and your friendship, I am deeply grateful."" Most former presidents look better through history's eyes . Gergen, who served in the White House in four administrations, said that once in the Oval Office you appreciate the ""continuity of the office."" ""You form part of a chain and each link is important. You almost have a sacred responsibility to keep the office strong,"" he said. Breaking the club's rules . Not all former presidents have held their tongue. Democratic President Jimmy Carter, who served one term in office, has a history of biting criticism of those who followed him in the White House. In 2007, Carter delivered a blistering critique of the Bush administration, telling the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette ""as far as the adverse impact on the nation around the world, this administration has been the worst in history."" Carter hasn't directed his criticism only at Republicans, though. In a February 2013 speech, he faulted the Obama administration for its dealings with North Korea and Iran. ""Our country is now looked upon as the foremost warlike nation on Earth, and there is almost a complete dearth now of commitment of America to negotiate differences with others,"" Carter said. And throughout much of Clinton's presidency, Carter was a Democratic agitator. He embarked on his own foreign policy projects, at times at direct odds with the White House, and after Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky became public, Carter questioned Clinton's morals. Even after Clinton left office, Carter continued to criticize. In February 2001, a month after the Clinton presidency had ended, Carter said Clinton's last-minute pardon of Marc Rich was a ""most serious mistake"" and even alleged that the reason Rich was pardoned was donations that Rich had made. ""I don't think there is any doubt that some of the factors in his pardon were attributable to his large gifts,"" Carter said. ""In my opinion, that was disgraceful."" But Carter has been the exception, not the rule. While some presidents have stepped out and criticized during the heat of a political campaign, it is a rare occurrence. ""Carter puts issues ahead of fraternity and will often speak out about things,"" Gergen said. ""I think it is part of his nature. Maybe being a one-term president changes your view."" 'Little Boy Blue' and the Bay of Pigs . Dwight Eisenhower is by most accounts the gold standard for how to deal with other presidents. Eisenhower chewed out his successor, John F. Kennedy, in private for the botched Bay of Pigs invasion, but publicly offered him a level of support. Kennedy had been in office for just three months when he called for a meeting with Eisenhower in April 1961 after the attempt to topple the young Castro regime in Cuba was a massive failure. The operation had originated before Eisenhower left office and Kennedy's administration had carried it out. The Kennedy-Eisenhower relationship had been frosty. Eisenhower had long viewed Kennedy as naive and young -- he referred to Kennedy as ""Little Boy Blue"" in private -- and Kennedy had disparaged the Eisenhower administration in his 1960 presidential campaign. The two put their chilly relationship aside, however, and Kennedy invited the former general to Camp David to review the mistakes in Cuba. According to Eisenhower's notes from the meeting and a number of media reports, the conversation between the new and former president previewed the pitfalls of foreign policy campaign promises: . Kennedy: ""No one knows how tough this job is until he's been in it a few months."" Eisenhower: ""Mr. President. If you will forgive me, I think I mentioned that to you three months ago."" After the meeting, Eisenhower stood in front of television cameras and said, ""I am all in favor of the United States supporting the man who has to carry the responsibility for our foreign affairs."" In ""The Presidents Club,"" Gibbs and Duffy write that despite the fact that all of these men have risen to the highest level of their profession, they not only work better together, but they need one another. ""There is no fraternity like it anywhere, and not just because of the barriers to entry of the privilege of membership,"" they write. ""For all of the club's self-serving habits and instincts, when it is functioning at its best, it can serve the president, help solve his problems and the nation's, and even save lives.""","Former presidents regularly hold their tongue when asked about their successors .
""I don't think it does any good,"" George W. Bush said when asked about Obama .

"(CNN) -- As of February, more U.S. adults own smartphones than simpler feature phones, according to new research from the Pew Internet and American Life Project. Well, to be more specific: In answering questions from Pew, 45% of cell phone owners said that their phone is a smartphone. Also, 49% of cell phone owners said that their phone operates on a smartphone platform common to the U.S. -- which includes BlackBerry. According to Pew: ""Taken together, just over half of cell owners (53%) said yes to one or both of these questions."" Here's how it breaks down, by platform: 20% of U.S. cell phone owners currently have an Android phone. For iPhone, 19%. BlackBerry, 6% (a 10% drop since as recently as May 2011). Since May (the last time Pew gathered these statistics), the biggest growth in smartphone ownership was among adults aged 18 to 24 (up 18%); the next highest growth was among those aged 45 to 54 (16%). Other demographic segments with high growth in smartphone use include whites (15%); those with some college education (14%); and women, rural dwellers and those aged 25-34 (13% each). In terms of income, the highest overall growth in smartphone use occurred in the lowest income bracket: 12% growth among people from households earning $30,000 per year or less. Nevertheless, across all age ranges, people from low-income households or who never attended college are still significantly less likely to own a smartphone. The slowest growth in smartphone use was among people aged 65 and over (up only 2%). Also, smartphone use grew only 5% among blacks and Hispanics -- two groups that typically have demonstrated the greatest propensity to avidly use all the capabilities of a smartphone. In the bigger picture, according to Pew, 88% of all U.S. adults now own a cell phone and 46% of all American adults now use smartphones. Currently, 41% of U.S. adults use simpler ""feature phones"" -- which often include a Web browser, e-mail, photo and video camera, and the ability to run simple apps. Do most consumers really know whether their phone is a smartphone? Over a year ago, I did some local mobile market research (to gauge mobile preferences here in Oakland, California). At that time, I was surprised how many people were unsure whether or not they had a smartphone. Many assumed that if their phone had a Web browser, it was a smartphone -- and similarly, many users of simple BlackBerry devices did not consider them to be smartphones. Earlier Pew research indicated similar consumer confusion about smartphones. But by now, more U.S. cell phone owners appear to have this question sorted out. According to Pew: ""As smartphone ownership has become more widespread over the last year, consumers have generally found it easier to answer questions about their phones and whether they own a smartphone or not. To be sure, there is still some confusion around this term as 8% of cell owners are still not sure if their phone is a smartphone. ""However, this is a significant decrease from the 14% of cell owners who were not sure if their phone was a smartphone or not in May 2011. Similarly, the proportion of cell owners who volunteered that they don't know what type of phone they have fell from 13% of cell owners in May 2011 to just 4% of cell owners in February 2012."" Of course, different sources of statistics view the smartphone/feature phone market split a bit differently. Data from comScore (which tracks the U.S. wireless market monthly) indicate that it won't be until later in 2012 that smartphones will start to comprise the majority of U.S. handsets in use. What does this halfway mark in the U.S. mobile market mean? Maybe not so much, for many people. Certainly, more people will have devices that technically are considered smartphones -- but people with lower incomes and educational attainment will tend to lag on getting smartphones. Also, not all smartphones are created equal. The low-cost Android market (particularly Android phones that can be obtained for less than $200 on no-contract plans) generally have slower processors, are running older versions of the Android operating system (which may not support popular apps) and often are harder to use or more cheaply made. As the Ice Cream Sandwich operating system becomes the norm for higher-end Android devices this year, you can bet that many people with cheap Android phones will still be running Gingerbread, unable to upgrade. Plus, in my experience, Android phones are especially prone to cryptic, hard-to-fix technical problems -- and tech support from carriers and manufacturers is practically worthless. If you're not comfortable with combing through user forums and trying fairly technical solutions, chances are you'll just have to give up and get a new phone in a year or less. I'm serious: the notorious contacts storage bug that plagues many HTC Android phones would have rendered my Droid Incredible completely useless last summer, had I not decided to root my phone and install a different version of Android called CyanogenMod7. Diagnosing that problem, trying different fixes and, eventually, taking a radical solution entailed a fair amount of research and work. I thrive on that kind of challenge -- but I can't imagine most consumers doing likewise. Finally, there's the learning curve. Smartphones are really hand-held computers that also happen to be able to make phone calls. Even the pricey, slick, user-friendly iPhone has a considerable learning curve, if you've never had a smartphone before. Most users of any kind of smartphone do not make use of most of what those devices can do. For many consumers, a smartphone will always be overkill. Smartphones may be becoming the norm, but that doesn't mean their benefits are evenly distributed. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Survey says ""just over half of cell owners"" have smartphone or use smartphone platform .

"(CNN) -- Although much attention is currently focused on the cases before the U.S. Supreme Court in which same-sex marriage advocates seek to change the definition of marriage, another longtime priority of their movement has been to add ""sexual orientation"" and ""gender identity"" as protected categories in federal civil rights laws, through the so-called ""Employment Non-Discrimination Act"" (ENDA). Here, ""gender identity"" refers not to one's biological sex, but to whether one feels male or female. One concern about ENDA is its impact on religious liberty. ENDA would effectively forbid employers to consider sexual conduct in evaluating the character of their employees or applicants. Although ENDA contains a limited ""religious exemption,"" there remain serious questions as to whether any exemption would be adequate to meet the concerns of people with religious and moral scruples against homosexual conduct. However, focusing only on the religious exemption plays into the false assumption that religious or moral objections to homosexuality are the only reason why anyone objects to this law. What's most significant about it may not be its impact on homosexual workers or religious employers, or the controversial insistence by LGBT activists that it cover transgender people as well. What really matters is the ratcheting up of federal government interference in the free market. Opinion: No one should be fired for being gay . The basic claim of most of the advocates of ENDA is that discrimination is wrong if based on factors ""not relevant to job performance."" But again, the question is who decides what is ""relevant to job performance"" -- the individual employer, or the government? The strong presumption should be in favor of the employer. Of course, federal law already interferes with private employment decisions with regard to a few specific characteristics. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 bars discrimination based on ""race, color, national origin, sex, and religion."" The first four of these are included largely because they are inborn, involuntary and immutable. While sexual attractions may be involuntary, neither sexual conduct nor transgender behavior meets any of these criteria. ENDA would provide fertile new ground for employers to be hit by costly lawsuits as well, with disgruntled employees suing for ""discrimination"" over a characteristic (in the case of sexual orientation) which is not even visible and of which the employer may have been unaware. In the case of public employers, such laws at the local and state level have led to large settlements being paid at taxpayers' expense. Opinion: America is at a crossroads on gay rights . Even secular employers have reason to worry about a possible increase in sexualization of the workplace. There is an inherent contradiction in the arguments of the advocates of ENDA, who contend that what they do in private has nothing to do with their work, but then also argue for the right to be ""out of the closet"" while at work. The gender identity provisions, meanwhile, undermine the right of employers to impose reasonable dress and grooming standards, by forbidding employers to use the most fundamental standard of all -- that people be dressed and groomed in a way that is culturally appropriate for their biological sex. ENDA prepares the way for a form of reverse discrimination -- against anyone who expresses disapproval of homosexual behavior. The more open homosexuals become, the more people with traditional values will be forced to conceal their views. This can happen even if the employee's views are expressed outside of work (as happened to Allstate's Matt Barber, who was fired), and when no reference is made to sexual orientation (as happened to the City of Oakland's Good News Employee Association, which was forbidden to speak about ""family values""). Opinion: Gay people live in 50 Americas . Often, social conservatives are accused of trying to ""legislate morality."" Yet ENDA itself is fraught with moral significance. It would be an official government declaration that homosexual behavior is the equivalent of heterosexual behavior in every way, and that those who believe otherwise are ""bigots."" A majority of Americans reject this view. (A poll taken by Public Religion Research Institute in September 2012 showed that 52% of Americans believe that ""sex between two adults of the same gender"" is ""morally wrong,"" and only 42% say it is ""morally acceptable."") ENDA should be opposed by anyone who believes in freedom of speech, freedom of association, and a free market economy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peter Sprigg.","Peter Sprigg: Employment Non-Discrimination Act is fraught with moral and legal problems .
Sprigg: ENDA could provide fertile ground for employers to be hit by costly lawsuits .
He says it would allow reverse discrimination against those who disapprove homosexuality .

"(CNN) -- During Saturday's White House correspondents dinner, ""Saturday Night Live's"" Seth Meyers jokingly scolded members of Congress for passing legislation they might never ever read. And he did so using a tech metaphor. ""I think you guys vote on bills in the same way the rest of us agree to updated terms and conditions on iTunes,"" he said. If you've spent any time downloading music, apps or other stuff from iTunes, you know what Meyers is talking about: Those messages from Apple that pop up on your laptop, iPad or iPhone and say, ""iTunes Terms and Conditions have changed. Before you can proceed you must read & accept the new Terms and Conditions."" You tap ""OK,"" and before you know it, you're staring at 56 pages of fine print on your screen. ""I don't have time to do this,"" you think. So you tap ""agree"" without reading a word. No big deal, right? ""Yeah, just agree,"" wrote one user, macbookairman, on a MacRumors.com forum, echoing the sentiments of many Apple users on the site. ""Nothing bad is going to happen."" Probably not. But two digital-media attorneys contacted by CNN say that customers of iTunes, Apple's online marketplace, should still be aware of what they're agreeing to -- and what legal rights they may be giving up. According to New York technology attorney Mark Grossman, selecting ""Agree"" serves as an electronic signature, due to a law passed in 2000. It has the same validity as typing your name in an e-mail or signing a document using a pen. Jonathan Handel, a Los Angeles-based entertainment  attorney who specializes in digital media, technology and intellectual property, said that because the iTunes terms are essentially a contract, people should treat them as such and give them more than a cursory glance. But both lawyers acknowledged that few people do. In fact, Grossman and Handel, both iTunes users, admitted they don't always read the terms either. To them, it is obvious why people are so nonchalant about the terms. ""When they change the iTunes terms, as they do all the time, they give you all 50 pages instead of giving the option of seeing the changes,"" Grossman said. ""We all know that nobody reads this stuff, but it is a binding contract."" Both Grossman and Handel are quick to say that this is not just an Apple issue. Other online retailers, such as Google's Android Marketplace, also impose legal terms on downloads. ""It's not that Apple is acting badly,"" Grossman said. ""None of that is true. Most people really just don't understand digital rights management."" Key clauses of the iTunes terms . CNN asked Handel and Grossman to go through key parts of the iTunes terms and explain exactly what are customers getting themselves into. Overall, the two lawyers said that none of the terms really surprised them, and that customers do not have much to worry about. But Grossman and Handel said that there are three clauses that users should be mindful of: . 1. Genius: The terms state, ""When you use the Genius feature, Apple will use this information and the contents of your iTunes library, as well as other information, to give personalized recommendations to you."" As most iTunes users know, Genius not only puts songs of the same genre together but also recommends new songs to download by going through your personal playlists. Grossman said that while this is not something to lose sleep over, people should know where their information is going. ""Some people would say, 'Oh my god. They can look at my play history,'"" he said. ""If you care [about that], you should disable it."" But Grossman said that he finds Apple's privacy policies scarier, and cited the recent iPhone geotracking controversy. ""It's a long-winded way of saying we can figure out where you are through your IP address,"" he said. ""You should assume that everything you do is tracked or trackable."" 2. Loss of purchases: The terms state, ""Products may be downloaded only once and cannot be replaced if lost for any reason. Once a Product is downloaded, it is your responsibility not to lose, destroy, or damage it, and Apple shall not be liable to you if you do so."" Grossman said that there is no leeway on this point, and that anyone who tried to take Apple to court over a lost digital file would lose very quickly. ""The argument is, you could have backed it up,"" he said. ""The contract clearly says 'we are not responsible,' and it's firmly established in the law."" 3. Licensing: The terms state, ""You agree that the Service, including but not limited to Products, graphics, user interface, audio clips, video clips [and] editorial content ... contains proprietary information and material that is owned by Apple and/or its licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not limited to copyright."" That sounds confusing. Handel explained it this way: When we buy something from iTunes, we are paying for the license to listen to music or watch a movie on our iPhone or other Apple device. But we are not buying the product itself and so we can't actually own it, he said. ""When you buy a book, you own the copy of that book but not the actual material,"" Handel said ""What you are buying here is right to use music on certain devices."" So why are the iTunes terms so long? The eye-glazing length of the jargon-filled document has frustrated some Apple users, who believe it should be shorter. ""I've bought cars with less paperwork,"" wrote Mel Martin from AOL Tech in a recent blog post. ""C'mon, Apple. Get it together."" By contrast, the terms and conditions for Google's Android Marketplace are about five pages long. (Android has some 200,000 apps, compared with more than 350,000 in Apple's App Store.) So why doesn't Apple make its iTunes terms more digestible by including a summary? Grossman said that doing so could potentially expose Apple to legal action. ""Whatever is in those 50 pages needed to be said,"" he said. ""Could you try [reducing] 50 to five and not lose anything? Someone is going to say that it wasn't in the summary and therefore does not count."" In addition, Handel said the lengthy terms are not all Apple's doing. ""When you got a content provider like a major label, they put pressure on Apple to keep their content protected,"" he said. ""As a result, you end up with these [lengthy] agreements."" What consumers should do . Both lawyers agreed Apple should clarify some of the language in the document to make it easier for customers to understand. Handel believes it would be helpful if the terms would tell consumers exactly what they're paying for. ""Here's what you are getting, here's what you are not getting,"" he said. ""If you do lose something, who you can call? That's what needs to be highlighted."" An Apple spokesman said the company would not comment for this story. It's not clear whether Apple will ever incorporate user suggestions and shorten or revise its iTunes  terms. But in the meantime, Handel said, Apple customers should scan those terms and conditions the next time they get that pop-up message. ""There's no reason an ordinary user should have to turn to a lawyer,"" he said. ""People should be empowered the way they deal with the world. And companies have to deal with that as well because they depend on users' goodwill. It's a delicate balance.""","What exactly are you agreeing to when you click ""Agree"" on iTunes' Terms and Conditions?

"(CNN) -- One week after an all-too-real scene befitting a movie played out on the famed Las Vegas Strip -- a pre-dawn shooting that sparked a deadly, fiery crash -- the man authorities suspect started it all is finally under arrest. Ammar Asim Faruq Harris, 26, was apprehended around noon (3 p.m. ET) on Thursday in North Hollywood, California, said FBI spokeswoman Lourdes Arocho. FBI agents and members of the Los Angeles Police Department's Fugitive Task Force made the arrest, according to Arocho. Harris was detained ""without incident"" in the Los Angeles neighborhood and will be held pending extradition proceedings, Las Vegas police said in a news release. ""Mr. Harris is in custody, and that's where we hope to keep him,"" said Las Vegas police Lt. Ray Steiber. This all went down 275 miles southwest from where, authorities say, Harris was at the wheel of a black Range Rover around 4:15 a.m. last Thursday when he pulled up to a Maserati and yelled at its driver, Kenneth Cherry, an aspiring rapper known as Kenny Clutch, a witness said, according to the arrest warrant. The Maserati's driver opened his window and the two then had a ""very brief exchange"" before the light turned green and they headed off. A few minutes later, the Range Rover's driver opened fire -- in two separate bursts -- at the Maserati, which was heading north on Las Vegas Boulevard, authorities said. The sequence ended with Cherry shot in the chest and arm. His vehicle collided with a taxi, which caught fire. The crash killed cab driver Michael Boldon and a passenger, Washington state resident Sandra Sutton-Wasmund. The 27-year-old Cherry later died at a hospital. ""I can't imagine anything more serious than firing a weapon from a moving vehicle into another moving vehicle on a corner such as Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo,"" Clark County District Attorney Steven Wolfson said Thursday. ""That is reckless. It disregards human life."" The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department identified Harris as the shooting suspect on Saturday, at which time they said his vehicle had been impounded. He had an ""extensive and violent criminal history"" and was considered armed and dangerous, according to police. Harris is charged with three counts of murder and ""other attendant felonies,"" according to Wolfson. The 11 charges include firing at a vehicle, firing from a vehicle and attempted murder, the criminal complaint states. Additional charges could be coming. Las Vegas Strip shooting suspect named, car impounded . The whole scene played out February 21 in the middle of the Las Vegas tourist hub, closing a block and a half of the well-known boulevard near some of the Nevada city's biggest draws -- Caesars Palace, the Bellagio, Bally's and the Flamingo. Seventeen years earlier, legendary rapper Tupac Shakur was shot dead two blocks from the accident scene. On Tuesday, police said they looking for a woman in connection with the latest shooting, adding that she was believed to be inside the Range Rover when the shots were fired. At the time, they characterized her as missing and possibly endangered. The photos they released, however, showed the wrong woman. Earlier Thursday, Las Vegas police said they no longer considered the woman -- identified as Yenesis Alfonso, also known as Tineesha Howard -- ""a missing person or a person of interest."" A woman who identified herself as Howard's mother told CNN that her daughter and Harris have been girlfriend and boyfriend for about a year. Steiber said this woman indeed had been in the Range Rover that Thursday morning with Harris and ""is safe."" She and two other passengers in the vehicle ""are not suspects"" and authorities currently do not have any plans to charge them, the lieutenant said. As to Harris, the local district attorney said all the information compiled thus far -- especially shooting into such a busy intersection, endangering an untold number of innocent people -- will be weighed in a decision on whether to seek the death penalty. ""There are certain consequences when you engage in that kind of behavior,"" Wolfson said. ""Thank God only three people lost their lives ... It could have been worse.""

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea's ruling Saenuri Party overwhelmingly selected Park Geun-hye as its presidential candidate during its political convention on Monday. If elected, Park -- the first woman ever nominated by the party, and the daughter of the country's former dictator -- would become the country's first-ever female president. Park won the support of her party running on a campaign of creating ""a country where no one is left behind."" Park has said she will focus on welfare policies if she is elected in December and will engage with North Korea if Pyongyang abandons its nuclear weapons program. Park hopes to unite a country that the legacy of her father, the late Park Chung-hee, still divides. The military dictator who went on to win elections was behind the rapid economic growth of South Korea during the 1960s, following the Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to1953 and devastated the peninsula. Supporters say he economically transformed the country, but critics say he disregarded democracy to do so and committed human rights abuses. Under pressure from the Kennedy administration in the United States, Park re-established civilian rule and was elected in a national referendum in 1963, and easily re-elected in 1967, former U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Donald Gregg noted in a 1999 Time article. Park ""had a hard time beating Kim Dae-jung in 1971. The validity of Park's narrow election victory is still questioned. In 1972, fearing Kim's political potency, Park changed the election system, allowing indirect voting that could be controlled by the incumbent. In 1972 and again in 1978 he was easily elected for six-year terms,"" wrote Gregg, who had served as ambassador from 1989 to 1993. Park was assassinated by his security chief in 1979. Park Geun-hye lost to the current president, Lee Myung-bak, in the party's last primary in 2007. Lee can only serve one term under South Korean law. CNN's Judy Kwon and Josh Levs contributed to this report.","If elected, Park Geun-hye would be the country's first female president .

"(CNN) -- Whether you are young or old, man or woman, very healthy or quite sick, it is almost a certainty that you are going to use a prescription drug in the next year or two. These medicines are crucial for preventing diseases and treating all sorts of ailments and problems. They are also expensive -- really expensive. For example, the best-selling drug of all time, Pfizer's cholesterol lowering drug Lipitor, went for $3.50 per pill and up before going generic in late 2011. But these days some retail chains are giving away generic Lipitor while the rest are charging barely 50 cents a pill. Prescription drugs cost Americans far more than they do people living in many other parts of the world. This is because drug companies spend a fortune on direct-to-consumer sales and marketing (which they don't do in other countries) and because other nations negotiate better deals for drugs than private insurers do in the United States. Is there anything that can be done to lower costs and increase the availability of more affordable and equally effective drugs? Yes. Earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in a case that drew little attention in the media: Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis. The stakes are high. When the court decides this case, probably in June, it will either reinforce Big Pharma shenanigans that have helped keep prices high and skyrocketing, or finally bring some relief to our pocketbook and escalating national health care bill for drugs. The issue is whether companies that own patents for prescription drugs can pay other companies that want to make cheaper generic versions not to do so, a practice known as pay-for-delay. One way to get lower prices on drugs is to get generic versions out to replace name-brand drugs. Generic drugs include the exact same active ingredients as the brand names. The difference is the name of the medication and the color or shape of the pill. Prescription drug manufacturers, fearing the arrival of cheaper generics and knowing or worrying that their patents alone won't keep out competitors, try to buy off the competition instead. In the case before the court, Solvay Pharmaceuticals is accused of paying off would-be generic manufacturers of their blockbuster drug AndroGel, a synthetic testosterone used by hundreds of thousands of AIDS patients, cancer patients, elderly men and others who suffer from low levels of testosterone. The generic companies were happy; they made money for doing nothing. Solvay continued to reap huge profits by keeping its monopoly in the market. The only losers were patients who have had to keep paying much higher prices for their name-brand-only drug. Usually, buying off your competitors is clearly illegal. Pay-for-delay deals run counter to basic antitrust principles. Nonetheless, some lower courts, declining to evaluate the strength of a patent, have let Big Pharma get away with these deals. Big Pharma views the settlements as a bargain. Instead of losing up to 90% of their market share bcause of the introduction of a generic, companies can simply pay generic manufacturers and make the competition go away. A 1984 law, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, was intended to speed up lower-cost generic competition. Big Pharma has managed to completely undermine Hatch-Waxman's intent, which was to put in place mechanisms that encouraged generic drug makers to challenge the weak patents often used to protect brand-name drugs. Unfortunately, the AndroGel case is not unique. In recent years, deals between Big Pharma and generic drug makers have delayed the introduction of a diverse range of cheaper generics including cancer drugs, AIDS treatments, blood pressure medications, antidepressants, allergy medications, sleep aids, ADD medications and more. The Congressional Budget Office says pay-for-delay tactics cost consumers billions of dollars and the Federal Trade Commission estimates these pay-for-delay deals will cost Americans up to $35 billion over the next 10 years. Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, who co-wrote the Hatch-Waxman Act, has been very vocal in arguing that a law Congress intended to help reduce the cost of prescription medicines has been hijacked by the drug industry to do the opposite. What we have now are the generic manufacturers and Big Pharma making a fortune by agreeing to delay competition that would bring lower priced drugs to market. A few weeks ago, the Indian Supreme Court took a hard look at the way big drug companies were using patent extensions to keep out low price competition. They said forget itâ€”that sort of tomfoolery will not be allowed. The U.S. Supreme Court would be wise to concur, heed the Federal Trade Commission's complaint and bring pay-for-delay to an abrupt end. The right prescription for making medicines cheaper and better is to encourage competition, not stifle it with backroom deals where everyone gets a great deal except for the patients. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Arthur Caplan and Zachary Caplan.","The Supreme Court probably will decide in June on Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis .

"(CNN) -- Cameron Russell aims to open up the media landscape to divergent voices a little bit at a time. In March, she helped launch Interrupt magazine, initially a webzine, so these other perspectives can join in the media conversation. Its first issue is devoted to body image. Russell is familiar with how women are portrayed in the media. She has been a model for brands such as Victoria's Secret, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Benetton and has appeared in the pages of Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and W. She is also known for her TEDx talk, ""Looks Aren't Everything,"" about those who win the genetic lottery and how society rewards the conventionally beautiful. To celebrate Interrupt magazine's launch, she's inviting the public to an art lab called ""You Are a Genius"" on New York's Lower East Side through Monday. It's at 215 Bowery St. CNN spoke recently with Russell about her new project. CNN: How did the idea come about? Cameron Russell: I had been thinking about an online participatory magazine for a while. After the amazing response to my TEDx talk, my Brooklyn-based art lab decided it was time to make this a reality. At the Big Bad Lab, we build participatory art and media platforms for causes, communities and organizations we care about. I run the magazine with Hannah Assebe and Allison Bland as well as hundreds of collaborators who provide writing, photos, editing help and moral support. CNN: Why Interrupt? Russell: Statistics show that diversity in the media is pretty dismal. Critical voices from women and people of color are missing from many important conversations. Ever watch a panel about immigration without any immigrants? Abortion without any women? Marriage rights without any LGBTQ people? We knew it's crazy to start another media platform, but we came across many authentic voices online and offline that we felt we can bring together and showcase. Sometimes you just need to interrupt! CNN: What are highlights in the first issue? Russell: It's all about body image. We found out that about 50% of 8-year-old girls don't like their bodies. But it's not just girls. Many women said they couldn't remember a time when they liked their bodies -- they couldn't remember what that felt like. We collaborated with Interrupt photographer Marie C. who interviewed girls under the age of 8 asking what they liked about their bodies. Their answers illuminated a perspective that was missing from mass-media conversations. These girls liked their bodies because they functioned well! Instead of the usual negative views -- I'm too fat or I don't like my nose -- these girls appreciated the fact that they can draw with their hands and run fast with their legs. It's refreshing. Their story was a huge success and got over 5,000 shares. Then there's Teagan Widmer, a transgender woman who wrote about trying to find the right bra. Her story is not exactly something the mainstream press would cover. But when we posted her advice to our Tumblr site it became one of the most popular stories. The lesson here is that when we value a narrow range of experiences and perspectives, we don't just have a media that lack diversity, we actually underestimate our audiences. There aren't just a few types of experiences that matter -- there are countless. CNN: With so many publications going digital only, what made you decide to put out a magazine? Russell: Our first print issue is a mock tabloid. Starting this week, it is appearing for free in nail salons, newsstands, dentist offices and other not-so-hidden places around NYC. Improving access to media means not just focusing on early adopters. We are spending our resources on building a community of collaborators who can share unique and critical views. CNN: What's been the most interesting experience in launching Interrupt? Russell: Actually, I think working on the offline Genius Lab. We wanted to build a space where people felt comfortable and genius in their identity. We have two selfie walls because taking a selfie is an innate and obvious way that draws in a lot of young people. We have a ""You Are a Genius' bar, where people can explore online resources for social services, civic engagement, health and well-being, and creative production. Having a physical offline space where children, teenagers and random passers-by can come in and get involved is amazing. Check them out on our Tumblr feed. Many of these people spent over an hour here, took pictures, wrote pieces for the next issue and hung out. Sometimes, great collaboration is hard to nurture online so doing so offline is the way to go. We hope to run another one this fall. Stay tuned. CNN: How do you get the word out? Russell: The first several hundred submissions came from people who found out about the project online, mostly through Twitter. Now that we're deeper into the project, we've cultivated many more collaborations. For example, (check out) a cool piece we did with teens at South End Technology Center in Boston. We've found artists like Ernest English, who made a piece that is drawing the most attention in the Genius Lab. CNN: What's the biggest difference between your webzine and say Buzzfeed? Russell: There are a ton of new media startups heavily focused on getting huge traffic and high growth, but that's not our central goal. We want to build something that disrupts the way we think media can be made. Can Interrupt make an impact? Russell: Every time someone who isn't a ""media maker"" creates something that goes viral, every time someone whose perspective is left out of mainstream media proves to make an impact, every time a contributor collaborates with someone new to make better work, we improve the media landscape a little bit. CNN: What did you want to be when you grow up? Russell: I always wanted to become president! When I was a kid, I was obsessed with politics. The first long book I remember reading was (Richard) Neustadt's ""Presidential Power"" in fourth grade. But as I learned more about our democracy, I realized that who participates, who votes and who gets elected is not as simple as it seems. That got me interested in how to bring people together and ignite alternative networks of power, and that's why I started the Big Bad Lab. CNN: Who are your heroes? Russell: I'm inspired by the people I work with. At the Genius Lab, we have three incredible artists. Ernest English makes enormous participatory public art pieces. Adalky Capellan is a young woman who creates very large-scale work. When I saw her photos, I knew she was perfect to do our dream selfie wall background. And then there's the graffiti artist and muralist known as miss163. She is a joy to work with, and her piece is all about love, which is great for us since one of our upcoming issues is about LGBT. CNN: If you can give one piece of advice to young women, what would it be? Russell: When boys at school told me I couldn't play their game, my mom told me to ask: ""Why, do you need a penis to play?""","Cameron Russell, a model known for her TEDx talk about beauty, helps launch magazine .

"(CNN) -- Our nation is experiencing a Crisis of Sheer Bottoms. Lululemon recently had to recall its popular yoga pants for being see-through, and now schools across the country are banning leggings from the classroom. Panic everyone! Girls are walking around with the outlines of their panties showing! And while this practice isn't what my mother would call ""proper ladylike demeanor,"" the personal choice of girls to wear leggings has come under attack. Pajamas in public: The battle of appropriate vs. comfy . It's the result of a common misunderstanding that leggings are pants. They are not. Yet a few girls' confusion on whether or not leggings are pants should not ruin the true comfort and convenience of leggings for those who understand the difference. I ask you, school administrators, if you have ever tried to put on a pair of freshly dried jeans in the morning, after the bliss of wearing your lightweight, loose PJs. The shock of restriction can be depressing. Devastating. Morale-killing. There are simply some days I cannot mentally handle the thought of wearing pants. And it is in these moments of mental weakness that I turn to my knight in shining cotton-spandex-blend: leggings. LZ Granderson: Parents, don't dress your girls like tramps . I make this choice mainly because of the way leggings create a similar silhouette to pants -- one that cannot be achieved by wearing other trouser-alternatives such as shorts, skirts or dresses -- without creating the dreaded muffin top. In fact, if you're going to restrict anything, it should be the extremely distracting bulge that occurs when an individual has on a pair of too tight, too low-rise jeans. Muffin tops are universally uncomfortable and unflattering and should be banned as such. Leggings, however, fulfill a niche within the wardrobe of every woman. They're neither pants nor tights. When paired with a tunic -- a top that covers the outline of a lady's underwear -- the resulting look is perfectly nondistracting, and shows less skin than shorts or skirts. It's flattering and a more slimming look than the extra thickness leggings would add under a skirt or dress -- the only way some schools want them to be worn. Ultimately, fashion is a form of self-expression, and students should be allowed to experiment with their personal style, especially during the formative years of middle and high school. Fashion trucks bring style to you . The problem we have here is an educational one. As places that aim to encourage self-improvement and development, schools should work toward teaching students why social norms -- like not wearing leggings as pants -- develop before they force students into following questionable dress code solutions. Teach a girl that a fish is not a cow before showing her how you would catch it, rather than forcing her to eat the fish with a side of steak in an attempt to demonstrate the difference. Otherwise, you might just end up with more muffin tops. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lucie Zhang.","Leggings can be school attire when worn correctly, fashion blogger Lucie Zhang writes .
Schools should focus on student development rather than wardrobe, she says .

"New York (CNN) -- A former New York Police Department officer is in custody and faces hate crime charges in connection to a string of anti-Semitic vandalism in Brooklyn, according to authorities. Michael Setiawan, who resigned from the department in 2007, was arrested Sunday after anti-Semitic graffiti was discovered Saturday evening in the Borough Park area of Brooklyn. Four buildings and 14 to 15 vehicles were vandalized, according to Sgt. John Buthorn. Police would not detail the specific wording of the messages, but said that the graffiti was anti-Semitic. New York City Councilman David Greenfield, D-Brooklyn, said the phrases were obscene and some swastikas were drawn. Greenfield added that a girls school was vandalized and that some students told their parents they are scared to return. ""This was an extremely brazen and hateful act,"" Greenfield told CNN. Setiawan, 36, is charged with 19 counts each of criminal mischief as a hate crime, aggravated harassment as a hate crime and criminal mischief. It is not clear whether Setiawan has legal representation.

"(CNN) -- Navy SEAL Aaron Vaughn ""wouldn't want to leave this Earth any other way than how he did,"" his wife told CNN, a day after she learned her husband was one of 30 U.S. service members killed in a helicopter crash Saturday in Afghanistan. ""He loved his job,"" Kimberly Vaughn said. ""There was no way -- even if you could tell him that this would have happened he would have done it anyway. All those men are like that. They're selfless."" The Navy confirmed that 22 SEALS and eight other U.S. service members died when a CH-47 Chinook crashed in the restive Wardak province early Saturday morning. It was the single largest loss of life for U.S. troops since the Afghan war began in late 2001. They were part of a ""quick reaction"" force sent to assist members of the 75th Army Ranger Regiment pinned down by enemy fire in a fierce firefight, a U.S. military official speaking on condition of anonymity told CNN. The mission targeted a Taliban commander directly responsible for attacks on U.S. troops, military officials with knowledge of the operation said Sunday. Insurgents are believed to have shot down the helicopter, said the official, who was not authorized to release details to the media. The Taliban claimed militants downed the helicopter with a rocket-propelled grenade. Known Taliban leader had been targeted . Kimberly Vaughn saw TV reports about the downed helicopter Saturday morning, but the tragedy reached her home when her doorbell rang. ""I thought, 'Oh, hopefully it's just a neighbor,' and as I rounded the stairs I saw the men in uniform and I just fell to my knees,"" she said. ""There's no preparing for it. It's something you see in the movies. It's not something you're supposed to live through."" Her father was standing with her to hold her up as the Navy officers told her that her husband was killed in action. ""I fell to my knees and cried and didn't want to hear it, but it's the truth,"" Vaughn said. ""You want it to be a mistake. You want them to say it's the wrong person, but I wouldn't wish this on anyone."" Complex landscape where troops died . Aaron Vaughn called his wife's cell phone Friday afternoon and spoke to her and their 2-year-old son Reagan, she said. ""It was actually a great conversation -- probably just about time before he went out to work that night,"" she said. ""We got to tell each other we loved each other, so it was a great conversation to have."" Aaron and Kimberly, married for three years, also have a 2-month-old daughter, Chamberlyn. He was stationed in Virginia Beach, Virginia, . ""I want to tell the world that he was an amazing man, that he was a wonderful husband, and a fabulous father to two wonderful children,"" she said. ""He was a warrior for Christ and he was a warrior for our country and he wouldn't want to leave this Earth any other way than how he did."" Vaughn's grandmother called him ""a great American"" who wanted to be a Navy SEAL ever since he was a boy. Geneva Carson Vaughn recalled one of the last conversations she had with him. ""I told him to be careful and he said, 'Granny, don't worry about me.' He said 'I'm not afraid because I know where I'm going if something happens to me.' Aaron was a Christian and he stood firm in his faith,"" she said, her voice heavy with emotion. ""He's with the Lord now and I'll see him again some day."" The family of Navy SEAL Tommy Ratzlaff confirmed to CNN that he was among those killed, but they were reluctant to say much about Ratzlaff or his job. Nephew Jeff Adams, who spoke via phone from Green Forest, Arkansas, Sunday said that Ratzlaff would want them to ""keep a low profile,"" because as a Navy SEAL you've ""got to stay secretive just to do his job."" ""He would have been grateful for all the support he's getting,"" Adams said. ""We're proud of him. He had a lot of accomplishments. He did what he loved and died defending everyone he loved."" Sgt. Patrick Hamburger, a soldier in the U.S. Army, was also on the fatal flight, his family said. Hamburger knew he was about to embark on an important and secret mission when he spoke to his family for the last time a few days ago, his brother said. Hamburger, 30, grew up in Lincoln, Nebraska, and joined the Nebraska National Guard soon after graduating from high school. A helicopter flight engineer, he arrived in Afghanistan only last week for his first tour of duty there, younger brother Chris Hamburger told CNN. He had told the family he wouldn't be in touch ""because they had stuff to do,"" Chris Hamburger said. Hamburger's longtime girlfriend, Candie Reagan, and family members ""got a pretty bad feeling about it"" when they first saw news reports of a downed U.S. helicopter Saturday morning, his brother said. ""It was so close to where he was at and we all started talking back and forth,"" Hamburger said. U.S. Army officers visited Reagan's Grand Island, Nebraska, home Saturday afternoon to tell her Hamburger was killed. ""I was walking out of work and his girlfriend called on the phone in total hysteria and told me, and I told everybody else,"" Hamburger said. ""They showed up at her door."" Patrick Hamburger has a 2-year-old daughter with Reagan, who he was planning to marry when he returned to Nebraska next May, his brother said. He was also helping raise Reagan's 13-year-old daughter, Chris Hamburger said. CNN blog: Afghanistan Crossroads . Hamburger sent an e-mail to Reagan the day before his death. She read the e-mail to CNN's Don Lemon. ""Please don't worry about me,"" Hamburger wrote. The e-mail assured Reagan that he was ""doing everything in his power to be safe and to make it home in one piece."" ""Don't worry, this place isn't going to change me, I'm going to change this place,"" his last e-mail said. ""Pat was always looking out for everyone around him,"" Chris Hamburger said. ""... he was always taking care of us. He would get himself into bad situations to help us. He was selfless. He didn't worry about him(self) half as much as he worried about everybody else. You could have been a complete stranger"" and he would have helped you. It was his selflessness that led him to Afghanistan, he said . ""His group was getting deployed and he wanted to be with them,"" he said. ""He said it was only right that he would be there, too."" Hamburger's family is gathering in Lincoln waiting for the return of his body. His girlfriend's brother, Sgt. David Mason, was also in Afghanistan and is escorting Hamburger home.

Michele MacNeill, a mother of eight children, was unresponsive in her bathtub, and Martin MacNeill, according to law enforcement at the scene, was hysterical and angry, cursing his wife for having had a recent face-lift. Michele MacNeill was pronounced dead later on April 11, 2007. The autopsy report determined she died of natural causes due to cardiovascular disease. But three years later, at the urging of her children, there was a new analysis of a toxicology report that changed everything. Combinations of medications found in Michele MacNeill's system were determined to have contributed to her death. Diazepam, Oxycodone, Promethazine and Zolpidem were all found in her system. Although none of the drugs alone was at toxic levels, Dr. Todd Grey, chief medical examiner of the Utah State Medical Examiner's Office, determined that, in combination, the drugs could have led to sedation and heart arrhythmia, resulting in cardiac death. On October 6, 2010, Michele MacNeill's cause of death was changed to ""combined effects of heart disease and drug toxicity."" The manner of death was changed from natural to undetermined. As investigators began to reopen the case, they realized they had a suspect: Michele MacNeill's husband. Prosecutors paint picture of a double life . Michele and Martin MacNeill seemed to live the American dream. He a doctor and lawyer, she a former beauty queen, had raised their family in Utah. Four of their eight children were adopted. Devoted to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Martin MacNeill also had taught Sunday school. Deadly remedy: Notorious doctors accused of murder . But prosecutors say that behind closed doors, what seemed to be the perfect union was anything but. Martin MacNeill, they say, led a double life, seeing women on the side. Legal documents state he announced to his wife and family several times in the years preceding his wife's death that he wanted out of the marriage. He never took that step, but prosecutors say that his affection for one woman in particular, Gypsy Willis, was the root of his motive for murder. Willis will be a star witness for the prosecution as Martin's trial begins in Provo, Utah. He is charged with the murder of his wife and obstruction of justice. Martin MacNeill case: The key players . Michele MacNeill had turned 50 in 2007. She and Martin had been married nearly 30 years. Legal documents state that it was Martin MacNeill's idea in March of that year that she undergo a face-lift. Family members say Michele MacNeill pushed back, not because she was refusing, but because she wanted to lose some extra weight and wanted to control her high blood pressure. But prosecutors say Martin MacNeill was relentless, even finding a plastic surgeon who was new to town and had advertised in the local paper. Martin MacNeill accompanied his wife on every presurgical visit to Dr. Scott Thompson. According to the affidavit for an arrest warrant, the last consultation with the plastic surgeon before the procedure took place was on April 1, 2007. Martin gave Thompson a list of medications he wanted for Michele. They included Lortab (Hydrocodone) in liquid form, Zolpidem, Valium (Diazepam), Phenergan (Promethazine) and Percocet (Oxycodone). Martin MacNeill: Suspicious or not? Documents state Thompson admitted that the Valium and Oxycodone ""were out of my usual routine."" After the cosmetic surgery on April 3, 2007, Thompson required Michele MacNeill to spend the night at the hospital. According to prosecutors, Martin MacNeill exchanged 24 text messages with Willis on the day of Michele's surgery. On April 4, Michele MacNeill was released to go home. Her daughter Alexis MacNeill was on spring break from medical school and attended to her mother at home. Martin told the daughter to get some sleep, and he would look after his wife through the night. The next morning, Alexis MacNeill told investigators she found her mother unresponsive. Martin MacNeill allegedly told his daughter he may have overmedicated his wife through the night. Alexis MacNeill then took over keeping a notebook of what medications she gave to her mother and when. Messages and medicines add to mystery . On April 5, legal documents state that Michele MacNeill told Alexis MacNeill that she believed her husband was trying to overmedicate her. Because her eyes were still bandaged from the surgery, she asked her daughter for help in identifying pills by feel. The daughter later told authorities her mother had told her that Martin MacNeill kept giving her pills, telling her to swallow. In an important pretrial ruling, Judge Derek Pullan determined that jurors will not be allowed to hear what Michele allegedly told her daughter that night: ""if anything happens to me, make sure it wasn't your dad."" Prosecutors intend to show jurors the numerous text messages Martin MacNeill exchanged with Willis in the days preceding his wife's death. On April 6, Michele MacNeill confronted her husband about phone records her daughter had researched, which showed one phone number repeatedly called day after day and night after night. Prosecutors say that number belonged to Willis. On April 10, Alexis MacNeill returned to medical school in Nevada, feeling her mother was now well enough. The next day, April 11, her mother was dead. The defense says that Michele MacNeill's death was an accident and that she died of natural causes. Conflicting timelines . Martin MacNeill says he has an alibi because he was at work the morning of his wife's death. According to an affidavit, Martin MacNeill dropped his youngest daughter, Ada, off at school at 8:30 a.m. on April 11. At 8:41 a.m., Alexis MacNeill called the home phone. Three minutes later, Michele MacNeill called Alexis MacNeill from her cell phone. According to Alexis MacNeill, her mother was in good spirits and optimistic about her future with Martin MacNeill. Martin said he went back to work around 9 or 9:30 a.m. He says he left his wife alone for approximately two hours. At 9:10 a.m., Alexis MacNeill received a phone call from her father, who called from his office phone. He asked his daughter to check in with her mother because ""Michele was not listening to him and getting out of bed."" Starting at 9:14 a.m., Martin MacNeill called his wife's cell phone with no answer. Several subsequent calls were made with the same result. Did doctor use medical know-how to kill wife? Legal documents state that Martin MacNeill was supposed to be working at a booth that day for the Developmental Center Safety Fair associated with his work, but he did not show up when he was supposed to. Employees say they do not know where he was from approximately 9:30 to 11 a.m. At 11 a.m., Martin MacNeill arrived at the safety fair. According to legal documents, witnesses say he was intent on getting his photograph taken there and appeared ""short tempered"" and ""belligerent."" Martin MacNeill left to pick up Ada at about 11:35 a.m. According to documents, they arrived home between 11:35 and 11:46 a.m. Martin MacNeill went to the kitchen, and Ada went to find her mother. Ada said she found her mother fully clothed in the tub with her head next to the tub's faucet, above reddish-brown water. She estimated the water was about one-quarter of the way up the tub. Her mother's hair was floating toward the drain. Ada went to get her father. Martin MacNeill's recounting of how he found his wife is strikingly different from Ada's and will be something prosecutors focus on to show MacNeill's alleged lack of veracity. He told authorities his wife was draped over the side of the tub, head first, with her head in the water. Autopsy results later showed Michele MacNeill's blood had pooled after death toward her lower extremities, which gives credence to Ada's version and discounts Martin MacNeill's. According to legal documents, Martin MacNeill told paramedic Marc Sanderson that his wife overdosed on medication and that was the cause of her death. In an interview, the girlfriend of Martin MacNeill's son Damian, Eileen Hang, told authorities that Martin MacNeill directed her to discard all of his wife's medications upon returning home from the hospital the day Michele MacNeill died. Additionally, the journal that Alexis MacNeill had used to keep a running tally of her mother's medications after surgery mysteriously disappeared. The trial begins with jury selection on Tuesday, and although prosecutors have laid their case out with numerous legal filings and a 2012 preliminary hearing, the defense has won many pretrial arguments keeping out statements and actions by Martin they feel are prejudicial and irrelevant. Critical rulings handed down in MacNeill case . What the defense has in its back pocket are the determinations of several experts set to testify in the trial. According to filed documents, not one conclusively states that Michele MacNeill's manner of death was by homicide. Forensic pathologists will only conclude to a degree of medical certainty that the manner of death is undetermined. Now, it will be up to a Utah jury of Martin MacNeill's peers to determine if his wife died at the hands of another -- specifically at the hands of her husband, who is now on trial for his life.","Jury selection begins Tuesday for Dr. Martin MacNeill's murder trial .

"(CNN) -- An Australian rugby league star has been sacked from his club in disgrace after a photograph circulated on social media that appeared to show him urinating into his own mouth. The vulgar photograph of Todd Carney, taken at a nightclub urinal, created a storm on social media, prompting the Cronulla Sharks club to release a statement Sunday announcing it had ended the player's contract with immediate effect. ""When Todd was first signed to the Sharks he was made well aware of his responsibilities both on and off the field, to himself, the club and to the game in general,"" read the statement, issued by the club's CEO Steve Noyce. ""The photograph that appeared last night on social media does not meet the values and standards the club is looking to uphold and take into the future."" It was the third time that Carney -- who in 2010 received the prestigious Dally M Medal as the Australian National Rugby League's player of the year -- had left a club following off-field disciplinary issues. The picture surfaced just a day after the 28-year-old had led his side to a hard-fought comeback win against the Brisbane Broncos. 'Heavy price' Carney's agent, David Riolo, appeared on Sydney radio station 2UE Monday saying his client had been dealt with unduly harshly by the club. He said Carney had not actually drunk his urine and that the picture, while regrettable, had never been meant to go public. ""Todd's paid a very, very heavy price for a photo that he didn't want out there or upload himself. It was supposed to be kept between mates,"" Riolo told the station. Carney had been contracted to Cronulla until the end of the 2018 season. The photo had been leaked after the associate who took the picture claimed to have lost his phone, Riolo said. Carney 's long list of previous indiscretions, mostly alcohol-related, features incriminating pictures of his genitals and alleged public urination. In 2008, he was accused of urinating on a patron in a Canberra nightclub, and the following year he made headlines after a woman found full-frontal nude pics of the player on a mobile phone she was loaned. While Carney has been widely criticized over his latest scandal, some present and former players have spoken out in support. Joel Thompson, a player for the Dragons, tweeted that he felt for Carney. ""It was his idea of a harmless joke between him & the so called mate in private. Toddy never hurt anyone,"" he wrote. ""I think it's a bad joke horribly gone wrong.""","Australian rugby league star Todd Carney has been sacked by his club over a lewd photo .

"London, England (CNN) -- It is a device that three quarters of the world's inhabitants have access to, according to the World Bank, but the words to describe it and etiquette of how to use it differ starkly across cultures. In the UK, it is called a mobile, in the U.S. cell phone, in Latin America celular, in Japan keitai (portable), in China shou-ji (hand machine), in Bangladesh muthophone (phone in the palm of your hand), in Sweden nalle (teddy bear), in Israel Pelephone (wonder phone) and in Germany a handy. In Japan, train commuters receive a barrage of recorded announcements telling them to switch their mobiles to silent or vibrate, referred to as ""manner mode"". Using a mobile in public is frowned upon in a land where collective needs are put above the individual's. ""Japanese culture highly values social harmony and social disturbance is heavily sanctioned,"" explains Satomi Sugiyama, associate professor at Franklin College Switzerland. If someone tries to board a bus while taking a call, the driver will not let them on, adds cultural anthropologist Mizuko Ito. ""In Japan your phone shouldn't be a nuisance to others,"" she says. ""This means generally keeping it on manner mode when out of the house, and not taking calls in cafes and restaurants. If somebody's phone rings, they will be flustered and silence it or take a very quick call,"" Ito explains. The density of urban spaces, the high use of public transportation, and the relative lack of privacy in homes contribute to ways of communicating that don't impose on others, she explains. Texting, mobile email, games and novels are more popular than voice calls among the Japanese. In Spain and Italy, in contrast, mobiles are used everywhere and people discuss are not averse to discussing their personal lives in public. Renfe, the state-owned train operating company in Spain, once promoted its journeys on a poster depicting conversations people can have with their partners on cell phones from the train. Smartphones are the new wingman . The Spanish, like the Italians, happily answer calls in restaurants, during business meetings, conferences and even sometimes during concerts. Discreetly texting or instant messaging under the table during meetings is also commonplace, Amparo Lasén, professor of sociology at the University Complutense de Madrid, says. Spanish people have always discussed their private lives in the streets, so doing so on mobile is just an evolution of that. ""Sometimes Spanish people leave movie theaters just to check what is happening on their phone,"" Lasén says. ""You have an obligation to be available to close friends, colleagues and customers. There is an obligation of accountability,"" she adds. However, it is not the Spaniards but the Finns who are the chattiest on their mobiles in Europe, clocking up an average of 257 minutes a month, according to GSMA's European Mobile Observatory 2011. Then again, it is the homeland of Nokia. Austrians follow closely behind the Finns at 240 minutes of use, while the Maltese spend the least time talking -- an average of 46 minutes per month. In parts of India and Africa, there is also a culture of split-second calls known as ""flashing"" or ""beeping."" Jonathan Donner, a researcher at Microsoft India who published a paper on ""The Rules of Beeping,"" said: ""Beeping is simple: A person calls a mobile telephone number and then hangs up before the mobile's owner can pick up the call."" The mobile owner can then phone them back, thus picking up the tab for the call. Donner first came across ""beeping"" in Rwanda and tracked it's use across Africa. He said the practice has many different meanings from ""Come and pick me up"", to ""Hi"", to ""I'm thinking of you"" to ""Call me back."" Read related: Seven ways mobile phones have changed Africa . As blogger Shashank Bengali writes: ""There are unwritten but deeply observed rules for flashing. When your mechanic wants to tell you your car is ready, for example, he can flash you -- it's your car, after all, and if you want it back, you'd better call him. ""It's also hierarchical: an employee calling a superior, who makes more money, is justified in flashing -- unless he really needs a favor."" He sounds a note of warning though: ""If you're trying to woo a lady, don't flash her. Ever."" Read more from Our Mobile Society . In India it is common for people to take calls inside a movie theater. People don't know if the call is important so they pick up, Umang Shah, of PhiMetrics, a telecom audit and consulting firm in India, says. Like in Spain, few Indians have or use voicemail, he added. Another quirk about India is that the caller may get to hear a Bollywood song, chosen by the subscriber instead of a ringing tone. Known as caller tunes, the subscriber is charged for this monthly and according to Shah, they are a big money-spinner. This is also common in parts of Africa where a caller might hear a quote from the Bible. In both continents, it is also common for people to take calls inside a movie theater. ""Even at highly official functions, during speeches and so on people in India take the call,"" Kadira Pethiyagoda, visiting doctoral student at St. Anthony's College, Oxford, says. ""Indian society has a long tradition of tolerance, including in terms of allowing others to infringe on what those in the West would consider one's personal space,"" he says. This is why phone use in cinemas and crowded trains, is tolerated, he adds. ""Indian society is also more communal than the West which, in part, leads to an increased importance of constantly staying in touch,"" he adds. ""People pick up their phones everywhere in Africa. The only places they don't are the mosque or the church,"" Abdullahi Arabo, BT research fellow at the Oxford Internet Institute, explains. ""Part of it is showing off that they have the device and if the call is from far away they like to show it's an international call."" In Japanese movie halls, on the contrary, 45-year-old Tokyo housewife Kanako Shibamoto says ""we are not allowed to even put phones into silent mode because the light of the screen might make other people annoyed."" Mobile manufacturers have also created double sim card handsets for the emerging markets so they can simultaneously benefit from the best data and voice deals. In general, Indians chat for an average of 346 minutes a month, benefiting from extremely low rates of 0.5 rupee (less than half a cent) a minute. Multiple sim ownership is common across Asia, Africa and Latin America. In Africa, it is because most of the service providers are unreliable and they can't get a signal, Arabo says. In the U.S., a Synovate market research poll found that 72 per cent of Americans considered loud conversations in public places to be the worst habits of cell phone users. Now the new gripe appears to be iPhone 4S users repeating simple questions to Apple's Siri, a robotic assistant. ""People seem to be accepting of phone calls but not of people talking to a disembodied voice on their phone,"" says Jane Vincent, visiting fellow at the Digital World Research Centre, University of Surrey. Texting was initially slow to take off in America, because ""differing networks did not work well together in the early days of mobile communication causing dysfunctional text messaging across networks,"" says Scott Campbell, professor of telecommunications at the University of Michigan. ""Texting is now as big in America as everywhere, "" he says. Campbell also said mobile internet has been slow on the uptake there as digital media tablets are becoming popular ways of going online. ""They have a larger screen and better interface than mobile."" Do you agree or disagree with the views in this article?

"(CNN) -- The Williams sisters have not had it easy in recent years. Two of the modern era's most successful women tennis players have been beset by health problems which have deprived the game of two of its most marketable stars. Serena has overcome life-threatening blood clots on both lungs, while older sibling Venus is this week making her long-awaited WTA Tour comeback as she battles a debilitating illness that has sidelined her since last year's U.S. Open. After pulling out of her second-round match in New York, Venus revealed she had been diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome -- an incurable condition which affects energy levels and causes pain in the joints. ""I just didn't feel well before my second-round match, to the point where I couldn't play,"" the 31-year-old told CNN's Connect the World show. ""At the beginning of the tournament, I wasn't sure how far I would get or what I would do, I was kind of living on a hope and a dream."" After a glittering 18-year professional career which has seen her become the first black woman to be ranked world No. 1 in the Open era, winning seven grand slam singles titles and 12 major doubles crowns alongside Serena, Williams would have been forgiven for deciding to chuck in the towel. But, instead of eying an early retirement, the winner of three Olympic gold medals set her sights on managing her illness and returning to the baseline ahead of this year's London Games. ""When you don't feel well and things are taken away from you, it's hard to stay positive,"" the former world No. 1 said. ""But, for me, it is not an option to get negative or to feel sorry for myself. ""It's easy to say, 'I've done enough' -- or it would be easy to go on a permanent vacation. But I need to look back and know that I gave everything. ""I know I still have so much more. Before I was sick I was on top of the world in singles and doubles. So that's my goal, to return to that."" Williams has played just one Fed Cup doubles rubber for the U.S. team and an exhibition match against Serena since withdrawing in New York on August 31, and she will make her return as a wildcard at the Miami Masters this week -- an event she has won on three occasions. ""I'm looking forward to coming back,"" she said. ""Sjogren's syndrome definitely changed my life, it changed everything. It changed how I eat, it changed my whole life."" Learning to manage her condition has given Williams hope of returning to her imperious best. By managing her diet, she is aiming to one day play unaffected by the syndrome's debilitating symptoms. ""I don't think the road will be perfect, but I think I can get it as close to perfect as possible,"" she said. ""My hope is to be symptom-free one day. I work with my doctors on that, but also I work on my diet, which I've found has been huge. With Sjogren's you deal with a lot of fatigue and joint pain and inflammation. ""It's because of the things I'm eating. I've started eating raw, vegan, unprocessed foods, doing lots of juicing, I juice twice a day. I drink wheatgrass. For me, it's worth doing everything I can to get back to what I love doing."" Another motivator for Williams is the prospect of challenging for a fourth Olympic gold medal in London, where the tennis tournament will be held at Wimbledon. Williams has enjoyed huge success at the All England Club in the past, having won five singles titles and four doubles crowns at the prestigious grass-court venue. ""For me, the Olympics have been the pinnacle of my career -- this will be my fourth,"" she said. ""Serena and I talk about playing in every Olympics possible, we keep saying how we're going to be take spots on the team forever! ""It is our dream, it is beyond our dreams. To participate would be great, to win something would be amazing.""","Venus and Serena Williams have been beset by health issues in recent times .

"(CNN) -- The San Francisco, California, Board of Supervisors on Tuesday banned most McDonald's Happy Meals with toys, as they're now served. The ordinance, which requires McDonald's and other fast-food servings with toys to meet new nutritional standards, now goes to Mayor Gavin Newsom, who indicated before his election last week to California lieutenant governor that he would veto the law. That veto would be meaningless because the board approved the ordinance 8-3, a veto-proof margin. With eight votes, the board could override the veto. The new law, which San Francisco officials hope other cities will adopt in battling a child obesity epidemic, was a defeat for McDonald's, which led the fight against the measure. ""As previously stated, we are extremely disappointed with this decision. It's not what our customers want, nor is it something they asked for,"" said McDonald's spokeswoman Danya Proud. Proud said public opinion is against such government intervention. ""Any fair and objective review of our menu and the actions we've taken will demonstrate we've added multiple options for parents to choose. This includes Apple Dippers (bagged, sliced, pre-peeled apples), low-fat one percent milk, 100 percent apple juice and Chicken McNuggets made with white meat,"" Proud said in a statement. ""And, as we have stated all along, we are committed to doing even more."" The new law addresses how toys and other marketing freebies entice kids to buy fast-food meals that are high in fat and calories, said Supervisor Eric Mar. He initiated the proposal because his fifth-grade daughter is in the 6-to-11 age group that has seen obesity rates quadruple over the past 30 years, the same time that the Happy Meal has been on the market. ""This is a simple and modest policy that holds fast food accountable,"" Mar said. Before Tuesday's vote, Mar cited a study released this week by Yale University's Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity, which examined 12 popular restaurant chains and found only 12 out of more than 3,000 kids' meal combinations met the nutritional guidelines for preschool-aged kids. The study said the fast food industry spent $4.2 billion on advertising in 2009 and found that 40 percent of preschool-aged children ask to go to McDonald's on a weekly basis, and 15 percent ask on a daily basis. Also, 84 percent of parents say they've taken their children to eat fast food at least once in the past week. Under the law, McDonald's and other restaurants will have until December 2011 to improve their meals' nutrition by adding fruits and vegetables -- if the chains want to keep offering toys, including those promoting the latest films. The food and beverages will have to contain fewer than 600 calories, and less than 35 percent of total calories will come from fat. The meal must contain half a cup of fruit and three-fourths cup of vegetables, and offer less than 640 milligrams of sodium and less than 0.5 milligrams of trans fat. Breakfast will have the option of offering half cups of fruit or vegetables. City officials said they expect a legal challenge from McDonald's, which declined to comment on possible legal action.","NEW: All fast food with toys must meet new nutrition criteria .

"(Health.com) -- People who consistently consume more calories than they burn each day will lose lean muscle and accumulate body fat more easily if their diets contain too little protein and too much fat and carbohydrates, suggests a study published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The study included 25 people who lived in a carefully controlled research facility for up to three months, exercising very little. For two of those months, all of the men and women intentionally ate about 1,000 calories per day more than they needed to maintain their weight, but they consumed different amounts of protein. People assigned to a low-protein diet gained roughly half as much weight during the experiment as those assigned to a standard or high-protein diet, but body fat—rather than lean body mass, which includes muscle—accounted for a much higher percentage of their weight gain. Health.com: How to boost your metabolism . In the low-protein group, approximately 90% of the extra daily calories were stored as body fat, but in the other groups just 50% of the added calories became fat and most of the remainder were burned off. People on the low-protein diet lost an average of 1.5 pounds of lean body mass, while those in the normal- and high-protein diets gained about 6 and 7 pounds, respectively. The findings debunk a decades-old theory, supported by more recent research, that low- or high-protein diets can fight weight gain by tricking the body into shedding excess calories without storing them, says study author Dr. George A. Bray, M.D., chief of clinical obesity and metabolism at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. ""You don't fool nature by adding more or less protein,"" he says. ""You may fool the scale, but you don't fool the metabolic processes which store excess calories as fat."" Health.com: 25 ways to cut 500 calories a day . The results suggest also that the minimum protein intake federal health officials currently recommend—46 grams per day for women and 56 grams per day for men—may not be enough to maintain muscle mass in some people. The study participants needed to consume at least 78 grams of protein per day to avoid losing muscle, Bray and his team found. David Heber, M.D., director of the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition, in Los Angeles, says most people should get about 20% of their total calories from protein. (By comparison, the three groups in the study got roughly 5%, 15%, and 25% of their calories from protein; people on the low-protein diet ate just 47 grams of protein per day.) Hitting the 20% target doesn't require eating a high-fat, high-protein Atkins-style diet, however. By relying on low-fat, high-protein foods such as white meat, ocean-caught fish, Greek yogurt, and nonfat cottage cheese, people can ensure they get enough protein while staying within their calorie budget, says Heber, who coauthored an editorial accompanying the study. ""Protein both helps control your appetite and maintain your lean body mass,"" he says. Though extremely small, the study is actually relatively large for its type. Finding large numbers of people who are willing to move into a research facility for three months is difficult, and the staff and technology needed to closely monitor their diets and body fat is very expensive, Bray says. Health.com: The top fat-burning foods . The study participants were healthy and relatively young (age 18 to 35), and although some were overweight, none were obese. Before the protein experiment began, they each spent about two to three weeks working with researchers to identify the daily calorie intake that would maintain their current weight. And the researchers discouraged the participants from exercising. ""They were basically young couch potatoes,"" Bray says. In the second phase of the study, when the participants were randomly assigned to one of the three protein levels and began overeating, the researchers tracked their body weight and the number of calories each participant burned while at rest. Every two weeks, the researchers also measured their body fat and lean body mass using a type of X-ray. People in the low-protein group gained about 7 pounds, on average, compared to 13 pounds for the normal-protein group and 14 pounds for the high-protein group. All three groups gained roughly the same amount of body fat, but only the low-protein group actually lost muscle mass. Health.com: Little ways to lose big pounds . At the end of the study, moreover, people who had been on normal- or high-protein diets were burning more calories while their bodies were at rest, whereas resting calorie expenditure stayed the same for the low-protein group. ""A lot of the extra energy expenditure that we found probably reflects the increased requirements for protein storage,"" Bray says, explaining that the body uses up more calories when it builds muscle than when it stores fat. People in the United States and other industrialized countries tend to eat a high-fat, high-carb, low-protein diet, and the findings show that overeating on this type of diet causes people to pack on fat, even if they're not necessarily packing on pounds, Heber and his coauthor note in their editorial. In addition to losing weight, people who are overweight or obese should consume adequate protein and focus on improving their ratio of body fat to lean muscle, Heber says. Adequate protein is increasingly important as we age, he adds, because people tend to lose muscle mass as they get older.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Baby formula, pigs, soybeans, oil and iron ore -- a seemingly disparate grouping -- have one thing in common. These commodities are all in high demand from an insatiable and growing China. Personal choice drives some of this demand. Chinese national interest fuels demand for others. For example, since 2008, when hundreds of thousands of babies fell ill from tainted milk formula, Chinese mainlanders began to travel the world looking for milk powder sources perceived as more trustworthy. A growing middle class, with the money to travel, are China's new global consumers looking for quality beyond borders. At the same time, because of China's lack of certain key resources needed to feed its people and fuel its economy -- the second largest in the world -- Beijing has moved to secure oil, iron ore and crops halfway around the world. Regardless, whether by choice or by force, China and its citizens are looking to new markets and buying what they need. It is a sign of things to come, say analysts. Soybeans: Stuff of oil, tofu and animal feed . ""On a per capita basis, China has half the arable land and a third to a quarter of the water than the global average,"" says Merritt Cluff of the Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. ""As they've gone through phenomenal growth, their food security has diminished marvelously. The question is who is going to feed China."" China is the world's largest importer of soybeans. The grain is one of the key starting links in the country's food chain, used to make cooking oil, tofu products and in feed for the burgeoning pig industry. In 2012, the world's most populous country imported 59% of the world's soybean supply, according to FAO data, up from about 25% in 2000. ""If they had to produce their own soybeans, they would need to use 28 million hectares,"" says Cluff. That would mean nearly one-quarter -- about 23% -- of China's total arable land would be used for soybeans, based on China's latest data from 2008. Just 12% of China's total area was arable in 2011, according to the World Bank, compared to 17.5% in the U.S. and 34% in Germany. ""They decided they could not do that (use so much arable land for soybeans) -- so they import,"" added Cluff. China relies on three main exporters for its soybean supply -- all in the Americas: Brazil, the U.S and Argentina which account for nearly half -- 46% -- of the supply of global exports. Pork: '470 million pigs in China' Besides soybeans, China is the world's biggest consumer of pork products eating ""more pig products than the rest of the world combined,"" says Cluff. ""Existing estimates have China at 48% of global consumption."" While China is estimated to have raised 470 million pigs in 2012, a number that increased about 1.5% each year over the last decade according to FAO, that has not been enough to keep up with demand. China is a net importer of pork products -- from the U.S., Europe and Canada in particular. ""There is lots of concern,"" added Cluff. ""As an analyst it's been on almost everyone's mind for the last 30 years."" That concern extends from food to natural resources and China's search for supplies around the world. Oil acquisitions and agreements . In July 2012, Chinese oil producer, CNOOC, paid $15 billion to acquire Nexen, one of Canada's largest independent oil companies which owns assets in the Gulf of Mexico, in the North Sea off the coast of Great Britain and off the coast of Nigeria. In November 2012, China's Sinopec and Saudi Arabia's Aramaco signed an agreement that would send 1.4 million barrels a day to the Asian nation. But one China economics watcher says the world ""shouldn't be too worried"" and that demand for food -- and for natural resources from oil to iron ore -- may eventually see decreased demand. ""China is the world's factory but those factories used to be in other cheaper countries. They got relocated to China because it's cheaper to manufacture,"" says Professor Zhigang Tao, Associate Dean of Business and Economics at the University of Hong Kong. ""So on paper, you see increasing demand from China for natural resources, but this is displacing demand from other countries -- from South Korea and Japan to China."" Production costs for foreign multinationals will rise in China, adds Tao, ""so a few years down the road we may ask the same questions about Vietnam and India.""","More affluent Chinese able to travel beyond borders for quality food products .

"(CNN) -- When Americans pick up their prescriptions from the pharmacy or reach for a prescription bottle from their medicine cabinet, they probably don't think much about where the drugs were made or whether they are safe. What most Americans don't realize is the staggering fact that the number of drug products manufactured outside the United States has doubled between 2001 and 2008. Nearly 40% of all drugs taken by Americans come from overseas, and nearly 80% of the active pharmaceutical ingredients used to make these drugs also come from foreign countries -- mainly China and India. I support the global marketplace, but we must be aware that without the proper enforcement of quality standards, the trust we put in the safety of the prescriptions we take can be broken at any time by a supplier in China, a counterfeiter in India or an importer from Thailand. Too many people believe incorrectly that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has the authority to properly monitor our drug supply system for safety. Under current law, the FDA does not have the authority to require a manufacturer to notify the agency if a drug has been corrupted, to recall pharmaceuticals that the FDA believes are unsafe, to refuse imported pharmaceuticals that are counterfeited at the border or to ensure that drug manufacturers are responsible for quality controls throughout their supply chain. These are authorities we must give to FDA if we are to truly oversee the safety of our drug supply. Even more worrisome is the inability of the FDA to conduct comparable inspections of domestic and foreign pharmaceutical manufacturers. It lacks the necessary funding and personnel. Domestic pharmaceutical facilities are inspected, on average, every two years by the FDA, whereas foreign drug facilities are inspected only every nine years. According to the Government Accountability Office, some of the 3,765 foreign drug establishments in the FDA's database may never have been inspected. An increasing demand, coupled with an expanding globalized drug market, blatantly calls for a more globalized and fully equipped FDA. A globalized FDA not only would ensure safety; it would also level the playing field for our manufacturers. FDA approval is the gold standard in the world marketplace: domestic pharmaceutical and ingredient manufacturers in the United States are held to that high standard. Their foreign counterparts should be, too. These competitors are from countries like India and China, nations that are home to 70% of the world's drug manufacturing sites, up from just 49% in 2004. Now, more than ever, U.S. manufacturing facilities should be rewarded, not penalized, for retaining jobs in the United States. It is not only fair and the right thing to do to protect American competitiveness, it's critically important for the health of American consumers. Although improved drug safety authorities for the FDA are important, they will be ineffective without a reliable funding stream, free from political whims, to implement them. A chronically underfunded agency, like the FDA, cannot successfully oversee our drug supply's safety without a stable funding source that will allow the agency to hire the staff it needs to conduct inspections overseas or to monitor pharmaceuticals that are entering our country. The re-authorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which expires in October, offers an opportunity to remedy these problems. As we begin debate and negotiations around the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, we have a responsibility to ensure that we are equipping the FDA with the resources, personnel and authorities to assure the pharmaceuticals Americans take every day are neither contaminated, counterfeited, corrupted nor mislabeled. It is hard to believe that it already has been three years since the contaminated blood thinner heparin, which authorities believe originated in China, killed several people and caused multiple cases of serious illness. Although fears generated by this crisis may have subsided, the reality that it can happen again should be fresh in the minds of those of us on the Hill as we reauthorize the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, and give the FDA more authority in the process. This is not and should not be a partisan issue. We must focus not only on making, and ensuring timely access to, the latest innovative drug treatments, but on establishing one quality standard for every drug sold in the United States. American consumers, and their families, deserve no less. Join the conversation on Facebook. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of John Dingell.","John Dingell: 40% of drugs, 80% of ingredients are from overseas, mainly China, India .
We have no monitoring system to prevent counterfeit or contaminated drugs, he writes .

"(CNN) -- Sharia stood immobile in front of the television, transfixed by its images, unaware of the world around her. Her family called her name over and over again, but she did not respond. It was that moment when they knew something was wrong. Initially, they thought it was a hearing problem. When they found nothing wrong, they decided to take 2-year-old Sharia to a specialist at an early detection center in 2009. ""Within five minutes of looking at Sharia, (the specialist) said that she has autism,"" said Sharia's father, Fawad Siddiqui. ""A very clear case of it."" Siddiqui, 38, and his wife, Ayza Sheikh, were under the impression that Sharia was simply a late talker. Originally from Pakistan, the Siddiquis had no relatives to advise them on their first child. Speech, occupational and behavior therapies helped some. But Sharia still struggled with communication. Then, in 2010, Apple's iPad was released. Siddiqui, a Columbia, Maryland, resident who shared his daughter's story on iReport, said that before having the iPad, Sharia's only way of communicating was crying. She was non-verbal and had no way of expressing what she wanted or how she was feeling. Apple's touchscreen gadget wasn't the first tablet computer and isn't the only one now. But it quickly emerged as the overwhelming market leader, introducing millions of people worldwide to the concept of a computer that dwells somewhere between a smartphone and a laptop and offers a large screen full of images and icons with which the user can interact with a single touch. ""What the iPad has done has given her a sense of control that she never had before,"" Siddiqui said. ""She knows when you touch it, something is supposed to happen. She knows she doesn't need to cry, she needs to point."" At first, Sharia enjoyed watching movies and playing games. However, through therapy and at home, she was introduced to apps such as Proloquo2Go, First Words, ABCs and Me and Puzzle Me, to name a handful. She soon learned to put together short sentences like ""I want Dora"" to express what she wanted. A communications revolution . Proloquo2Go was Sharia's first app and the first real augmented communication app, released first for iPhones in 2009. AAC, or augmentative and alternative communication, is a series of interventions used to help children with severe communication disorders communicate. Many apps are designed based on this method of therapy. David Niemeijer, founder and CEO of Amsterdam-based AssistiveWare, creator of Proloquo2Go, said that 90% of AAC users use an iPad for communication, and more than 25% use an iPhone or iPod Touch, according to the company's surveys. About half of them reported improved speech abilities. A search for ""autism apps"" for the iPad in Apple's App Store brings 764 hits. About 142 were released this year. Similarly, dozens of assistance and education autism apps have sprung up on tablets and other devices running Google's Android operating system. The accessibility of online stores as a platform for apps has opened a new avenue for parents. Those with the know-how are able to create apps based on their child's specific needs. Tricia Estrada of San Diego has developed apps for her son, Evan. The app and website Wonkido has a series of animations, each about four to five minutes in length, depicting various social skills such as ""asking to play"" and ""going potty."" By watching, kids acquire a database of episodes to draw from for future social situations, she said. Estrada said the most appealing facet of the iPad is its mobility. Before, when Evan needed to learn a new concept in the middle of soccer practice or while at a restaurant, she had no way of showing him until the therapist gave him a card or bought a DVD weeks later. With the iPad or iPhone, it's immediate. ""I think (the iPad) is revolutionizing the augmentative communication field,"" said Dr. Oliver Wendt, assistant professor of speech, language and hearing sciences at Purdue University. ""It's a very cost-effective system. Before, we had these expensive, bulky items, which now can be replaced with an iPad."" The equipment that was used previously could cost $9,000 to $15,000. iPads are now available for as little as $399. A majority of the apps on the iPad are paid apps that cost 99 cents to $299.99. Some of these prices may seem rather expensive for regular iPad users, but autism communities are thrilled. iReport: Steve Jobs helped my autistic son speak . Wendt, who specializes in technological aspects of AAC solutions, collaborated with Purdue student group Engineering Projects in Community Service to develop a free app called SPEAKall! based on a widespread autism intervention known as Picture Exchange Communication System. Traditionally, in a low-technology approach, children would hand laminated picture cards to their therapist or caretaker in order tell them what they want. The app has two visible parts on the screen: a top row and a bottom row. The top has pictures and symbols, and the bottom is a storyboarding strip where kids can drag and drop the pictures to create sentences. These pictures can include objects, feelings or anything relevant to the child. ""It is very important to put symbols on that are truly reinforcing for the child, symbols that match something the child really wants,"" Wendt said. The app allows parents to take pictures on the spot and add them to the existing bank of symbols. The child is then able to create sentences using the images, such as ""I want apple"" or ""I feel sad."" At the end, they can push the ""Speak All"" icon to hear the sentence. Removing ""extra baggage"" Martha Herbert, a pediatric neurologist and neuroscientist at Massachusetts General Hospital of Harvard Medical School in Boston, said the iPad allows individuals to bypass many difficulties they have in communicating. Herbert explains that apraxia or dyspraxia is what makes communication difficult. Apraxia means that although your brain can develop an intention of doing something, it is physically difficult to do it. You may want to speak but can't move your lips. ""These apps allow you to do a shortcut around the neuromotor problems getting in the way of communication,"" Herbert said. Communication is not just limited to speech. In order to understand and respond to an individual, you have to be able to decode their body language, facial expressions and lip movement as well. Using the iPad takes away this ""extra baggage,"" Herbert said. ""I think it's opening a whole interesting way to be creative about giving people assistance,"" she said. ""You can measure somebody's stress level and somebody can feed it back into their app and tell you if they're about to fall apart or have a meltdown."" Khengwah Koh is managing partner with Hearty SPIN, a new startup in Singapore that also recently released an app for low-functioning individuals with autism called Picture AAC. The app is available in English as well as Mandarin and is used in more than 15 countries. While Koh thinks his app and the iPad are great tools for these individuals, he thinks they should be used only as a supplement to other kinds of learning and therapy. ""For a child, it shouldn't be just given to them as a babysitting tool,"" Koh said. ""When the app is introduced to the child, first train them how to use (it). ... It's not a game. It's something to be introduced in a systematic way."" Phoebe Tucker, a speech language pathologist in Bridgeport, Connecticut, has developed a center for autism called the Montano Assistive Technology Center, a division of United Cerebral Palsy, to integrate various forms of technology for therapy. The center uses iPads along with other therapies. Although Apple did not create the iPad with the intention of helping children with autism, the company does try to build in features for people with disabilities. ""Steve Jobs did not realize he was giving a voice to the voiceless,"" Tucker said. That voice is exactly what Siddiqui feels has been given to Sharia. She is now able to speak in broken sentences and is aware of the world around her. Her family sees small triumphs every day. For the first time in three years, the Siddiquis are thinking of taking Sharia to Pakistan to see their extended family. Sharia was diagnosed shortly after their first visit, and the family there only recently came to know of her diagnosis after watching Siddiqui's iReport video of Sharia. The trip depends on whether therapists say Sharia is ready for such a change in environment. But Siddiqui is confident and looking forward to the trip. ""I often tell my wife I think of it as Sharia before the iPad and Sharia after the iPad,"" Siddiqui said. ""It was that significant.""","Touchscreen iPads are giving voice to autistic children, adults .

"(RollingStone.com ) -- Like many authors, Courtney Love is a victim of writer's block. For over a year, the Hole singer has been penning a memoir with Rolling Stone writer Anthony Bozza. ""The Girl With the Most Cake"" was originally supposed to hit bookshelves in December 2013 before being pushed back to early-2014. Three-quarters of the way through the year and Love's memoir is still nowhere on the release schedule, and as the singer tells Paper, don't expect to be reading her life story anytime soon. As it turns out, not everyone can write a 460-page autobiography as quickly and easily as Morrissey. RS: Q&A with Courtney Love on her memoir and 'I'm Still Alive' tour . ""It's a disaster. A nightmare,"" Love told Paper (via Billboard) of her memoir. ""I never wanted to write a book in my entire life. It just sort of happened. And I have a co-writer, but it's just not working."" While Love originally told Rolling Stone the book would cover her life up until 2008, she's since subtracted a few years from the tome. ""What happens from 2006 on in the book is my personal business. I've been discreet from that time on, and I want to keep it that way,"" Love said. RS: Courtney Love wrote letters of apology over Springsteen diss . When Love first discussed her memoir with Rolling Stone in June 2013, she had high hopes for the book, citing Patti Smith's ""Just Kids"" and Russell Brand's ""My Booky Wook"" as influences. (But not Keith Richards' ""Life,"" since it was ""just so bloody long, I didn't even finish it."") If and when Love's memoir finally arrives through William Morrow at Harper Collins, she promises it will focus on her battles with drug addiction, her ""tragic romance"" with Kurt Cobain, her relationships with Billy Corgan and Trent Reznor, and her early years as a stripper. While Love won't be hosting any book signings soon, you can see her on TV this fall: The 50-year-old rocker will appear in multiple episodes of ""Sons of Anarchy's"" upcoming season, where she'll play a preschool teacher. Love also told Paper she hopes to reunite Hole's classic lineup of Eric Erlandson, Patty Schemel and Melissa Auf der Maur at some point in 2015. See the original story at RollingStone.com.

"(CNN) -- After years hovering in the vapor, little more than a dream for Apple fanatics everywhere, the elusive iWatch may be days away from becoming a reality. But it will hardly be the first smartwatch to hit the market. After breaking ground with products like the iPhone and iPad, Apple finds itself playing catch-up in the wearables world. The Pebble watch was the first smartwatch to gain any kind of notoriety. In 2012, the smartwatch pulled in more than $10 million on Kickstarter. Pebble connects to an iPhone or Android phone via Bluetooth and has a growing selection of its own apps. Smartwatches have become much more feature-rich since the launch of the Pebble. Samsung leads the pack in jack-of-all-trades smartwatches. A year after releasing its first smartwatch, Samsung unveiled its third device in the line last week. The Gear S smartwatch has a curved screen and 3G connectivity, making it the first smartwatch from a major company that doesn't require a Bluetooth connection to a smartphone. There's also the LG G Watch R and Moto 360, two newish devices that are aiming to have a more fashionable design and take advantage of Google's Android Wear platform. So far, smartwatches haven't caught on widely in the way smartphones and tablets have. Whether Apple's entry into the field changes that remains to be seen. Apple was granted a patent for a smartwatch in July -- with a touch screen, an accelerometer, a GPS receiver, Bluetooth and alerts via vibration. The iWatch in the patent connects to a mobile device, displays notifications and allows users to accept or decline phone calls. Apple is expected to unveil its iWatch smartwatch on September 9.","Apple may unveil a smartwatch next week .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- French President Francois Hollande mourned the deaths of four French soldiers and an Afghan interpreter killed in a suicide bombing and said his plan to withdraw combat forces by year's end will start next month. The bombing occurred in Kapisa province, where most of the 3,300 French troops have been operating in Afghanistan. Hollande said five people were also injured in the attack. It brings the number of French fatalities in the Afghan war to 87. ""I wish to express my gratitude and that of the whole nation to our soldiers. I salute their dedication and courage. I know the strength of character of our troops in Afghanistan,"" Hollande said. ""I offer families the message of solidarity and comfort of the French people. A national tribute will be paid to the victims and the wounded will be repatriated as soon as possible. A plane has already left and will ensure them back as soon as possible."" French troops deployed under the NATO-led command have been operating in Kapisa province for years. Hollande, who recently won the presidential election, campaigned for an accelerated withdrawal of combat forces and called for their removal from the field by the end of the year. Trainers will remain in the country longer. NATO's International Security Assistance Force reported the deaths of four service members in an attack, but deferred identification of the nationalities to the troops' home countries. After he took office last month, Hollande visited French troops in the same region where the soldiers died. He visited the Nijrab forward operating base in the northeastern province of Kapisa and paid tribute to those soldiers killed in the line of duty. The Afghan Interior Ministry said the bombing took place in the Nijrab district's Pul-i-Khwaja bazaar area. Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said the bomber was a man who had been dressed in a burqa, the head-to-toe garment Muslim women in Afghanistan wear to cover their bodies in public. The Taliban claimed responsibility, saying the man had explosives strapped to his body. The incident is under investigation, and Hollande said he asked Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and the army chief of staff to go to Afghanistan on Sunday and ""mark the nation's support to our forces."" ""The decision that I made to accelerate the withdrawal of French combat forces from Afghanistan will begin in July. It will be implemented and completed by the end of 2012. Until then, everything must be done for our troops meet our obligations with the highest level of security and the utmost vigilance. I take this commitment and I will be the guarantor of the transaction."" In a separate incident, ISAF reported the death of a service member after a roadside bombing in eastern Afghanistan. It did not list the province and the nationality of the soldier.

"(CNN) -- Is the much-loved Piaggio Vespa more iconic than the floppy disk? Is the iPod more of a design classic than the Airbus A380? These are the questions we put to some of the world's greatest designers when we asked them to nominate what they believe to be the most iconic industrial design from the last 100 years. This Saturday, the international design community will celebrate World Industrial Design Day. To mark the event, CNN spoke to Gianfranco Zaccai, CEO of global design and innovation consultancy Continuum. Zaccai and his team have been behind some of the most well-known products of the last three decades -- including the iconic Reebok Pump -- and have worked with brands including American Express, PepsiCo and Samsung. CNN asked the celebrated innovator about his views on what constitutes good design at the turn of the millennium. What do you think are the most iconic designs from the last 100 years? Let us know in the comments section below. CNN: What are the three most important principles of good product design? Gianfranco Zaccai (GZ): I think these three principles apply to not just product design, but good design in general: . 1. Empathy: empathy is a realization that you are not designing for yourself but for others. You have to get into the lives of the people who will use it. 2. Pragmatism: realize there are some things you have to deal with to fulfill this type of product or service. It has to fulfill the performance requirement, it has to be cost effective and it has to be producible -- all things you can quantify. 3. Passion: if you just stop at what you can quantify and measure you haven't gone far enough. Think about a great meal you have had. It's not just the ingredients that make it great, but the creativity and sensitivity of cook that makes it special. CNN: How do you keep the spirit of innovation in your company alive? GZ: First and foremost it's about hiring really good, talented people who think holistically about understanding people's lives and then solving problems in a rational and emotional way. It's about surrounding yourself with people with different skill sets and sensibilities where they stimulate and inform each other. The best outcomes come from bringing two or more sensibilities together and the end result is more than the sum of the two people. CNN: What's the best way for an amateur designer to turn a great idea into a reality? GZ: In my mind, there are no amateur designers. They love what they do, they just may not be getting paid for it yet. There are lots of different people who didn't study engineering or design who come up with great ideas. The important thing is for them to step outside of themselves and understand what they are sensing may be reflective of a broader need. They should see what they can perceive about a certain context and come back and re-look at their idea. Then it is time to take it further. Don't be afraid to share it with others who can help make it stronger. The most difficult thing about vetting new ideas is knowing which idea is truly great and which one of those are truly deployable, and then making it real by addressing all of the functional, emotional and cost issues. And lastly, having the perseverance to overcome the organizational obstacles in getting that innovation into a socioeconomic system where it can be disseminated and revenue generating. You have to be able to see the opportunity, develop it, support it and promote it and, almost always, you need creative partners to do all of it. To be the innovator and champion of the original vision is where the passion of an amateur comes in. CNN: How does the environment you work in affect creativity? GZ: An environment is important but it's not just one environment or office that fosters creativity. We allow people to work in different ways. Some space allows our team to work where they can be introspective and concentrate deeply and others that are more collaborative and allows them to interact with others both physically and virtually. CNN: Is product design a science or an art? GZ: It's neither science nor art but some of both. Design tries to leverage scientific and technological opportunities and limitations with an understanding of human beings and their psychological, social, and cultural context. Design is about identifying real needs and desires; solving problems while connecting with people emotionally. Design is about making a positive difference in people lives, which they embrace because of the holistic value it provides. It's functional, fun, enjoyable, uplifting and sustainable. CNN: What are the most common mistakes people make when designing a new product? GZ: I think the most common mistake that people make when designing something new is not really understanding the true issues and thinking that design is all about aesthetics. CNN: What's the best piece of advice anyone has ever given you? GZ: ""You don't know what you don't know."" A young engineer said that to me once and it's really true. The idea of not starting off anything as ""the expert"", even if you happen to know a lot about it, is a good way to create new paradigms and not just repeat the past.","Top designers nominate most iconic industrial design from the last hundred years .

"(Health.com) -- Do any of these scenarios sound familiar? -Somebody cuts in front of you in the grocery store line. You're irritated but don't say anything. -Your friend asks you to pick her up at the airport. Again. You say yes even though you have no time. -You disagree with your boss, but say nothing. Are you nodding yes? We've all had moments when we think to ourselves, I'm confident, I'm smart, and I know what I want. Why can't I just say it? Being assertive -- standing up for yourself and speaking your mind in a clear yet respectful way -- can be remarkably hard on a good day. We worry if we ask for what we need, we'll put someone out. Or that we'll come across as a you-know-what. So we just let what we want go unsaid. In your defense, it is more of a challenge to state your needs these days. The still-shaky economy may make you hesitant to ask for that raise at work (or disagree with your boss). You may feel worse turning down requests from family, knowing they're stressed. And it's not just your imagination that more folks are losing it in public -- witness the woman who sprayed mace at fellow shoppers on Black Friday. A recent survey revealed that 86 percent of Americans have been the victims of rude behavior. The payoff of having your own back, though, is enormous -- and it's so much more than simply getting your way. ""When you say what you want, you live a happier and more authentic life,"" says Caroline Adams Miller, author of ""Creating Your Best Life."" That's true no matter what the outcome, adds Simon Rego, Psy.D., director of the cognitive behavioral training program at Montefiore Medical Center in New York. Those who speak up do better at work, have more time, and have healthier relationships. So how do you master this crucial skill? ""The three keys,"" explains Miller, ""are knowing what you want, believing you have a right to it, and finding the courage to express it."" You are about to become your own best advocate. Health.com: 29 days to a healthier relationship . Be assertive... with friends and family . Surprisingly, your nearest and dearest can be the toughest to stand up to. ""They're the people we want to please the most,"" says Miller. ""We'd rather be unhappy ourselves than disappoint them."" To complicate matters, we have to fight a lifetime of old (bad) habits -- saying ""sure"" when we really mean ""no way."" True, standing your ground can be momentarily uncomfortable, but it's so worth it -- your relationships will be stronger as a result, Miller says. Try these tactics: . Challenge #1: Saying ""no!"" Your sister is always asking you to watch her kids; your running buddy keeps dragging you to Spinning class, which you hate. The solution: There is a trick to getting your way when someone doesn't pick up subtle hints. Take a deep breath so you sound calm -- not at all peeved -- and just say, ""No, I'm not able to do that,"" Rego advises. If she pushes back (which she likely will), repeat, minus a word or two. ""No. I'm not able."" This may go on for several rounds. ""Each time, you shorten the phrase until you eventually just say no,"" says Rego. ""It's extremely effective because it allows you to convey what you want without getting upset."" Challenge #2: Sticking with your values . You need your folks to respect your decisions about your kids; you want the in-laws to stop breaking the bank on gifts. The solution: When you're broaching a sensitive topic, it's best to start with the word ""I"". (This is particularly effective at deflecting arguments over hot button issues.) ""'I' statements are expressions of your own needs, which we all are entitled to have,"" explains Rego. Using ""you"" statements, on the other hand, can put the other person on the defensive, which will only escalate an argument. Keep it simple and own it (""I feel my kids act crazy when they eat candy, so I don't want them to have any."") Challenge #3: Breaking a pattern . Maybe your friend always picks the restaurants (and pricey ones), or your man chooses your vacation spots every time. The solution: This one pops up a lot in close relationships. Here, too, that ""I"" statement is key. Soften it with at least one thing the other person will be happy to hear (""Our date nights are so fun, but I would love to see a movie this time."") Health.com: 10 ways to shake up date night . Be assertive... at work . Overdue for a raise? Longing for more interesting assignments? Working with spotlight stealers who are constantly broadcasting their accomplishments (and taking credit for some of yours)? You know what you have to do! ""Assertiveness is one of the most crucial tools for success,"" says Gabriela Cora, M.D., a psychiatrist who specializes in workplace issues. ""To be able to clarify a thought, make it precise and relevant, and share it at the right moment is an art."" Luckily, it's a learnable art. Consider this your cheat sheet for getting your needs met from 9 to 5. What you need: To ask for a raise or promotion (and get it) How to proceed: Show your best stuff is yet to come . Let's be honest: Even if you feel confident, marching into your boss's office and rattling off all the reasons you deserve more cash or seniority isn't the way to go. That said, ""You do need to present your case, citing two or three of the valuable contributions you've made to the company,"" recommends Cora. (Timing your request so it comes after a major accomplishment is wise.) But equally crucial, Cora adds, is to look ahead to the future: ""Discuss the things you want to do in the future that are in line with your boss's goals."" In so doing, you gain power in the negotiations, because you become more valuable to your manager. What if the head honcho flat-out says no? Ask: ""Can we talk about my performance again in six months?"" You're not pushing; you're just showing that you believe in your skills enough to follow through. What you need: To get an idea green-lighted at a meeting . How to proceed: Don't go first . Though you may think it's always best to get your idea on the table first, it's actually smarter to listen before you take the floor, Cora says. ""Look to see how you can piggyback your idea with someone else's,"" she advises. Wait for two or three people to speak, then make your case, saying something like, ""My idea, which works well with Sara's, is...."" The piggyback strategy not only increases the likelihood that you'll get your idea approved, but it also tends to defuse competition between co-workers and create a more collaborative and creative workplace. Keep in mind that brevity helps, so make your case in three to five sentences, advises Cora: ""When people don't feel confident, they tend to say too little or too much, and their point isn't clear.""

"(CNN) -- Country singer Kevin Sharp, best known for his hit ""Nobody Knows,"" has died from ""complications due to cancer,"" his mother said. He was 43. Sharp was diagnosed with cancer as a teenager. He was treated, and the disease did not reoccur, but he had problems later in life because of the radiation and chemotherapy he underwent, Elaine Sharp said. She said her son died Saturday night at her home in Fair Oaks, California. ""He had a good, strong heart,"" she said. ""He's not hurting anymore."" His website added that he died ""due to ongoing complications from past stomach surgeries and digestive issues."" Sharp grew up wanting to be a singer. According to a 1998 story from Music City News, Sharp -- who grew up in a large family that included a number of foster children -- was a high school athlete and participated in a Sacramento, California, light-opera company. It was during his senior year in high school that he was diagnosed with a rare form of bone cancer that had spread to his lungs. The ailment led to Sharp meeting producer and songwriter David Foster through the Make-a-Wish Foundation. Foster, known for his work with such artists as Celine Dion and Michael Buble, helped support Sharp through years of chemotherapy and a determination to wean himself from painkillers after the cancer went into remission. In the mid-'90s, after working at an amusement park to make ends meet, Sharp landed a record deal and went to No. 1 on the country charts with ""Nobody Knows."" He followed that hit with a handful of others, including ""She's Sure Taking It Well"" and ""If You Love Somebody."" The early success, he said, was ""like learning how to swim by somebody throwing you into the deep end of the swimming pool,"" he told Country Weekly in 2012. But he didn't forget the Make-a-Wish Foundation through his own highs and lows, becoming a representative and getting a tattoo of the organization's logo on his chest. In later years, he traveled the country as a motivational speaker, according to his website, and wrote a book called ""Tragedy's Gift."" His willingness to help others kept hope alive in himself, he told Country Weekly. ""If I didn't believe what I try to express and tell others, I wouldn't be here,"" he said. Singers and industry insiders expressed their condolences on Twitter. ""Sorry to hear of the passing of Kevin Sharp,"" wrote Mark Wills. ""My fellow country artist Kevin Sharp passed away last night and went to spend Easter with Jesus. My prayers to the family,"" tweeted Billy Dean.

"(CNN) -- President Obama has decided to move ahead with a variety of gun control measures, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein has proposed a new assault weapons ban. While Washington debates new proposals on gun control, attention also needs to focus on obstacles to effective enforcement of existing gun laws, including the ban imposed by Congress on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives creating a federal database of firearms transactions. A discussion of the origin of that ban, which was initially enacted in response to a proposal made when I served as the assistant Treasury secretary overseeing the bureau, is useful to a better understanding of the dynamics of the debate over specific gun control proposals. Sadly, both then and now, logic often loses out. Early in 1978, the proposal we developed was relatively simple: Manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers would file reports of sales of firearms with the bureau, but to avoid the argument that the bureau was impermissibly creating a national registry of gun owners, retailers would not be required to list the name of the retail purchaser. The rationale for creating a centralized firearms transaction database was twofold. First, it would speed up the ability to trace guns found at crime scenes, since even with the less sophisticated technology then available, such traces would still be able to be done virtually instantaneously. Gun control advocates march as nation reels from school shootings . Second, and even more significant, it would allow the bureau to analyze the flow of firearms to identify potential diversions to the illegal gun market. For example, if a hundred handguns a week were going to one dealer in a small town in Virginia, that would suggest the possibility that guns were being sold illegally by that dealer to individuals smuggling them to New York or other states. By allowing this kind of analysis, the bureau could target investigative resources on dealers mostly likely to be violating the law. Proceeding with what can only be described as youthful naivetÃ©, the day the proposed regulations were published, I convened a briefing for interested parties, including the NRA and other anti-gun control groups. After all, none of these proposals would in any way alter the rules relating to gun ownership. The hope was that understanding the limited nature of the proposal would mute their opposition. I was very wrong. We had to withdraw the proposals, and Congress punitively reduced the bureau's budget and ultimately banned it from creating such firearms transaction databases. The opposition to the proposed regulations was intense, with opponents writing hundreds of thousands of often angry letters, both to Treasury and to members of Congress. Little of the opposition, however, focused on the actual proposals themselves. One common thread to the opposition was the ""slippery slope argument,"" which argued that the regulation would create a centralized list of all gun owners' names -- which it would not have done -- or would lead to the creation of such a list, which would then enable the government to seize everyone's weapons and put us on a path to dictatorship. Gun violence measures? Would they work? After all, it was argued, this is what the Nazis had done. Another often-used argument was that what we were proposing would not stop all criminals from securing or using firearms, and therefore it was not something worth doing. Arguments like these prevent an honest discussion of any proposal to address the problem of gun violence in America. The assumption that any regulation of firearms sets us on the path to confiscation of weapons is not only ludicrous on its face, it ignores all political reality. And, if the test for any proposal is whether it totally solves the problem being addressed, then no action would be taken addressing so many of society's important issues. Why require the use of seat belts if wearing a seat belt does not always save a life in an accident? Why prohibit people from carrying guns onto planes if it doesn't eliminate all risk of hijacking? Why prohibit providing assistance to terrorists if it doesn't stop all terrorist acts? Why require tests for the issuance of driver's licenses if it doesn't stop all accidents? We require these regulations because they address problems that need to be addressed and because if these regulations can save some lives, they are steps worth taking. So it should be with the gun debate. No proposal, or set of proposals, will ever stop all gun crime. But the 1978 proposals could have stopped some illegal sales of guns by renegade dealers. And things like forced waiting periods for gun purchases, requiring background checks for firearms buyers at gun shows and a ban on assault weapons would certainly save some lives. NRA chief: Obama makes 'mockery' of American freedoms . Maybe it is thousands of lives over time; maybe it is hundreds. But isn't every life saved worth it? Would it not have been worth it if even some of the lives lost at Sandy Hook could have been saved because the shooter did not have an assault weapon? Gun control is not the total answer to the problem of mass shootings, but it plainly needs to be part of any meaningful response. Let's hope that this time the debate on gun control will be a more sensible one. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Richard Davis.","Richard Davis: Modest gun control proposals become focus of attacks .

"(Time.com) -- How much would it take for you to consider selling your bone marrow? A U.S. appeals court puts the price at about $3,000 in a ruling that now makes it legal to pay donors for their bone-marrow tissue. The court's decision may well help thousands of sick patients who need bone-marrow transplants to survive, but it also begs the question, What other body parts might next be up for sale? The ruling came about at the end of 2011, in a decision to an October 2009 lawsuit brought by a group of cancer patients, parents and bone-marrow-donation advocates against the government over the federal law banning the buying and selling of bodily organs. The plaintiffs were led by Doreen Flynn, who has three daughters who suffer from Fanconi anemia, a blood disorder that requires bone-marrow transplants to treat. Flynn and the other plaintiffs said that too many such patients die waiting for transplants and argued that we should be allowed to pay people to donate their marrow as a way of ensuring a more reliable supply. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed. Time.com: Facebook now lets organ donors tell their friends . At the core of the plaintiffs' argument was the National Organ Transplantation Act (NOTA), which since 1984 has forbid the buying and selling of human organs, including bone marrow. But new developments in bone-marrow extraction have made marrow donation not much different from donating blood. Traditionally, bone-marrow donation required anesthesia and long needles to extract the marrow from the hip bones of donors. Now, a technique called peripheral apheresis allows doctors to extract blood stem cells directly from the blood, instead of the bone -- patients first take a drug that pulls stem cells from the bone and into the blood -- meaning that the marrow cells should be considered a fluid like blood, rather than an organ, the plaintiffs argued. NOTA doesn't prohibit payments for blood or other fluids, such as plasma or semen. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder decided not to ask the Supreme Court to review the appellate court's decision, which would have been the next step in overturning it. That means the ruling stands -- and that people can now be paid up to $3,000 for their marrow, as long as it is collected by apheresis. In a concession to the spirit of NOTA, however, the compensation can't be in cash; it needs to be in the form of a voucher that can be applied to things such as scholarships, education, housing or a donation to a charity. While the decision applies only to the nine states covered by the Ninth Circuit court, and only to bone marrow obtained through apheresis, it does raise bigger questions about how we will look at organ donation in the future. With about 114,000 people waiting for organs in the U.S. alone on any given day, and only 3,300 donors, the urgent medical need runs up against moral standards of the value of human life. Once we start paying for the parts we need, though, how far do we go? ""We don't allow people to buy and sell human beings, that's slavery,"" says Dr. Robert Klitzman, director of the bioethics program at Columbia University. ""Should we allow people to buy and sell human body parts?"" Time.com: Where do (some) babies come from? In Washington, a new law bans anonymous sperm and egg donors . Of course, certain body parts are already up for sale. Aside from sperm and plasma, donors can also be paid for their eggs and hair. But by expanding that list, the court's ruling reopens the long-standing ethical debate over the commercialization of human tissues. For now, legally ""sellable"" human body parts aren't ones that could be used to cure fatal diseases, which prevents a market frenzy. But if the bone-marrow case starts changing that -- and experts say it could -- it might jump-start a dangerous trend in which lower-income groups were disproportionately targeted or incentivized to give up their marrow and people with rarer blood types demanded more money for their valuable cells. Still, the benefits of compensating people for providing cells like bone marrow -- which the body replaces and which involves a relatively safe extraction -- may be wide-reaching, as Flynn and the plaintiffs argue. ""In some sense, this is a policy experiment, and it could potentially be groundbreaking,"" says Jeffrey Kahn, professor of bioethics and public policy at the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics. ""If we compensate donors who give by apheresis and more people end up receiving [blood-] stem-cell transplants, maybe we should think about this for other kinds of donations."" Already, he points out, there is international trade for other organs. Websites allow people to find matching donors for kidneys, for example (people are born with two kidneys, but can live with one), and U.S. patients travel to developing nations to obtain transplants. There isn't supposed to be compensation, but it's hard to regulate such exchanges. Time.com: Britain lifts ban on gay men donating blood. Could the U.S. be far behind? Nevertheless, selling tissues or organs may not be the logical first step in addressing the disconnect between supply and demand. Klitzman notes that there are other changes we can make to U.S. organ-donation policy that might improve giving rates. In Spain, for example, all citizens are organ donors by default; those who don't wish to participate must opt out. In the U.S., in contrast, people must voluntarily opt in to give, which could be a deterrent. Even within such systems, there are incentives that can entice donors. In Israel, for example, family members of donors are given priority on the waiting list of organs should they need one. ""To me, it's not clear that the current decision means we should overturn NOTA,"" says Klitzman. ""I personally think we should have the debate about whether there are creative ways of enhancing donation of organs."" Certainly, if the goal is to improve the supply of much needed tissues without toeing an ethically troublesome line, those options are probably worth pursuing.

"PHUKET, Thailand (CNN) -- Raddled by allegations of corruption and mismanagement by inept authorities, the Thai holiday island of Phuket looked destined within a few years to have its once-beautiful beaches destroyed by the side-effects of mass tourism. Since the 2004 tsunami made Phuket even more of a household name around the world, tourism boosters have catered to sharply increasing numbers of visitors, with the island's overwhelmed infrastructure deteriorating rapidly. Bliss for many tourists became a sunbed on the beach where they could alternately loll and dip all day long and be serviced by locals bringing coconut juice or a cocktail, or perhaps even a delicious tiger prawn sandwich. Such pleasurable indulgence proved exceedingly popular, and some beaches eventually succumbed each tourism high season under a colorful sea of sunbeds. Along the foreshores at many beaches, illegal businesses sprang up and grew. Beach clubs predominated, but a visitor could spend hours in a beauty salon on the sand or even buy a time-share property. A constant stream of vendors left tourists little time to snooze. Paradise was evaporating, if it hadn't already. Then an odd and unexpected event happened. On May 22, Thailand Army chief General Prayuth Chan-ocha assumed control of the country in a military coup following months of political deadlock between opposing sides. Within 72 hours of taking control, soldiers were on the holiday island, bearing promises to save the beaches and berate the administrators accused of contributing to the island's simultaneous ride and slide towards increased popularity and ruin. A few months on, and Phuket continues to shake off the effects of decades of corruption that have been plaguing the island since the 1970s, when the first backpackers discovered the brilliance of the island's gleaming west coast beaches and locals discovered a new source of income. Until recently, tales of mafia-connected taxi drivers ruling Phuket made regular headlines, whether it was for charging ridiculously high fares that were six times those of the capital, Bangkok, or forcing passengers to pay double -- not just for the trip to their destination, but also for the cabbie's ride alone back to his base. In more extreme cases, drivers threatened violence against those who attempted to use alternative transportation options, as was reported in Phuketwan. Soldiers on the beach . Today, all that is changing, due to the arrival of khaki and camouflage-clad soldiers. They tromped Patong, Phuket's main west coast beach, enforcing the message that the hedonistic days of lazing on sunbeds were at an end, along with the vendors' privateering ways. Sand was making a comeback. Though many Western countries have condemned Thailand's latest coup, it may just have saved Phuket from further decay -- also producing some useful social outcomes for similarly troubled holiday destinations in other parts of the country. All beaches in Thailand are public space by law. The prohibition of private business operations on these public beaches is without exception, but has been ignored on Phuket and some other tourism destinations. Restaurants and beach clubs illegally encroached onto the beaches, right down to the high-water mark in some places, too many deriving private profits by ignoring the law and doing as they pleased. Because Phuket is 860 kilometers south of Bangkok, administrators posted by the central government seemed reluctant to interfere. Phuket locals interpreted the concept of public beaches as meaning anyone could use them, so first they added sunbeds, then built thatch and bamboo bars on the shore fronts. Over the years, entrepreneurs joined in, expanding the venues into large restaurants and beachclubs. Some businesses grew to the water's edge. There was no enforcement by authorities to force them off the beach. Once the army took charge, though, local mayor Ma-Ann Samran, of Cherng Talay, says he began receiving daily visits from officers in civilian clothes. He had no hesitation in admitting he eventually acted to save the beaches in his district out of fear. ''I was genuinely scared,'' Ma-Ann said. ''The Army let me know I had to act.'' After decades of local ''law'' being applied, the Army transformation came at great speed, within days of the May 22 coup. Graders toppled beach clubs and restaurants, while the sunbeds and umbrellas were carted off in pickup trucks, banned forever. Tourists on all Phuket beaches now sit on towels. Taxi clampdown . What happened with the alleged bullying that taxi drivers were accused of, was even more remarkable. Present-day Phuket police commander Major General Praveen Pongsirin found the army to be perfect allies to conclude his covert months' long investigation of the island's ''mafia.'' In June, more than 100 taxi and tuk-tuk drivers were arrested and charged with alleged intimidation and extortion, according to police. Local officials who allegedly sponsored the bullies were also arrested, police officials said. These include the Mayor of Karon municipality and his two deputies, plus the chief engineer and the senior officer, who remain on bail facing six charges apiece. When they appear in court, they'll have the opportunity to enter their pleas. They have denied the charges. No court date has been set. Anti-money laundering officers have conducted raids and more arrests have been promised. Investigations into illegal activities at Phuket airport have also been launched. The major general said: ''Phuket wasn't like this 15 years ago. As the power of the taxis grew, so did their greed and arrogance. The only laws they recognized were their own laws.'' Administrators posted by Bangkok came and went on Phuket periodically, perceiving all the problems, but powerless to seriously fix them. ''The administrators were all able to see what ailed Phuket when they first arrived,'' Major General Praveen said. ""But the longer they stayed, the more they integrated with the lawless locals and the more blind they became.'' The army takeover, though, brought to the island the one organization in Thailand that is large enough to confront the taxi drivers and end corruption on, and abuse of, the beaches. The message from the army's Major General Somchai Ponatong on arrival was blunt but effective: ''I told the local authorities to do their jobs. The novel idea appears to be working.'' Backhanders and corruption were previously considered the most efficient way for anyone to get anything done on Phuket, according to experienced expat investors and some local businesspeople. Investigations are now underway into resorts suspected of encroaching on national park land, led by the Public-sector Anti-Corruption Commission. Villas dot the hillsides, well above height restrictions. On Phuket, regulations stipulate constructions can be no higher than 80 meters above sea level. Now, says Major General Somchai, complaints are being listened to and acted upon, without regard to the degree of influence Thailand's resident ''big people'' have always had under civilian governments. ''Enforce the law,'' the major general tells his officers, ''free from favor."" ''By November [start of the tourism high season] we will have made Phuket safe, clean and appealing to everyone,'' he says. Coup, what a difference it's made here.

"Washington (CNN) -- The federal government will loosen restrictions on U.S. relations with Cuba within two weeks, the White House said Friday. ""Today, President Obama has directed the secretaries of State, Treasury, and Homeland Security to take a series of steps to continue efforts to reach out to the Cuban people in support of their desire to freely determine their country's future,"" the White House said in a written statement. The changes concern travel, non-family remittances and U.S. airports supporting licensed charter flights to and from Cuba. ""These measures will increase people-to-people contact; support civil society in Cuba; enhance the free flow of information to, from, and among the Cuban people; and help promote their independence from Cuban authorities,"" it said. ""The president believes these actions, combined with the continuation of the embargo, are important steps in reaching the widely shared goal of a Cuba that respects the basic rights of all its citizens."" Under the new regulations, religious organizations can sponsor religious travel to the island and institutions of higher education can sponsor travel to the island for course work for academic credit -- both under a general license. And licensing of educational exchanges not involving academic study pursuant to a degree program will be restored, it said. In addition, specifically licensed academic institutions will be able to sponsor academic seminars, conferences, and workshops related to Cuba and allow faculty, staff, and students to attend. Licensing also will be allowed for a greater scope of journalistic activities, it said. And any U.S. person will be able to send up to $500 every three months to non-family members in Cuba ""subject to the limitation that they cannot be provided to senior Cuban government officials or senior members of the Cuban Communist Party."" Obama also directed that any U.S. international airport can apply to service licensed charters ""provided such airports have adequate customs and immigration capabilities and a licensed travel service provider has expressed an interest in providing service to and from Cuba from that airport."" Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, dismissed the move toward rapprochement. ""These changes will not help better human rights nor will they help Cubans free themselves of the tyranny that surrounds them,"" she said in a written statement. The changes ""will just bring economic benefits to the Cuban regime,"" she said. ""That's really absurd,"" responded Wayne Smith, former chief of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, in a telephone interview with CNN from Washington, where he directs the Center for International Policy's Cuba Program. He described the changes as ""terrific,"" but said the administration should go further by ending the half-century-old trade embargo. ""It really hasn't done the slightest bit of good,"" he said. ""Our whole policy has to be called a failure. It has not forced the Cubans to change.

"(CNN) -- Hotel guests across the continent are not happy. At least that's the conclusion from a survey released Wednesday by J.D. Power and Associates. Right down the line, the 2012 North America Hotel Guest Satisfaction Index Study ticks off a laundry list of items that are dragging the industry to its lowest satisfaction level since 2006: check-in/check-out, food and beverage, hotel services and facilities. One item in particular -- Internet costs and fees -- is pressing some guests' buttons, churning up ""resentment, frustration and anger,"" says Stuart Greif, a J.D. Power vice president. ""At the luxury level, where they're paying for a lot more, there's a feeling you should be giving more freebies, like Internet Wi-Fi, which many lower priced hotels offer for free."" The anger is rooted in this cultural shift: We're at a tipping point where hotel guests value Internet access as they would a bed and hot water, says Greif. ""You can't live without it."" 10 budget all-inclusive resorts . To hammer the point home, let's state the obvious: Hotels are not going to be charging a fee to have a bed included in your room. ""It matters to me,"" says Neil Glick, a Washington, D.C.-based real estate agent who says he always looks for hotel Wi-Fi, especially when vacationing overseas. It's not as important in the States, he says, because he can surf on his phone. But, ""internationally it gets real expensive real fast to use 3G."" For the data heads, here are the stats: J.D. Power gathered information from thousands of consumers about their overall satisfaction about hotel costs and fees. The rating plunged 76 points this year: 16 points lower than last year's survey. Power blames it on hotel Internet charges. Fifty-five percent of hotel guests use the Internet during their hotel stay, the study says, up from 20% in 2006. Of those, 87% connect by Wi-Fi. Eleven percent of guests who use the Internet said they paid an additional fee to connect. Rules and rates for luxury hotel Internet access are far from universal. Some luxury hotels offer Internet access for members of loyalty programs, like Ritz-Carlton's Club Level, although some Ritz-Carltons provide free Internet access in hotel lobbies. Wiring a hotel for Wi-Fi can be pricier than one might expect. A line capable of delivering 100 megabits of data per second can cost in the range of $3,000 to $4,000 per month, says Don O'Neal, a veteran hotel consultant for Internet infrastructure. He says an upscale New York hotel he's familiar with has two 20 megabit connections with a monthly cost between $700 to $800 each. ""It is expensive,"" says Joe McInerney of the American Hotel & Lodging Association. ""And somebody has to pay for it."" He says high-end hotels aren't able to add another $15 or $20 to their room rates, which is why they charge the fees. ""If you're not going to use it, then why should you pay for it?"" Competition at budget and moderately priced hotels is more intense because consumers often make their hotel choices based solely on price. They expect rates with amenities rolled in. Wi-Fi is like breakfast. At a luxury hotel, breakfast will cost you. Budget hotels are likely to throw in coffee and a bagel. Confessions of a hotel mystery shopper . What really gets guests' goat, according to the survey, is when hotels charge for Internet via so-called ""resort fees."" Nickel and diming fuels resentment, Greif says, because guests feel like they're being charged extra for something they give away down the street at the neighborhood coffee shop. Industry experts see increased use of a tiered system of Web access, perhaps offering basic Internet free and then charging for higher data access for things like watching video or playing online games. Not only do hotel guests want more bandwidth, they also want to use more devices in their rooms -- cell phones, laptops and tablets. Many hotels seem to be behind the tech curve. ""It's part of the whole catch-up,"" says Greif. ""Hotels are still trying to run on the lower cost structure from the economic downturn."" Consumer demands are bouncing back with the economy, he says, but hotels aren't catching up quickly enough. ""Internet access is a big part of that."" The cost and fees data is part of a larger survey of more than 61,000 hotel guests from the United States and Canada. Overall, the survey has a 1,000-point scale. This year's overall score is 757, which is down seven points from last year, measured across seven types of hotels, from economy/budget to extended stay to luxury. The Ritz-Carlton topped the survey in the luxury category with 864 points. In the economy/budget bracket, Jameson Inn received 751. Other top hotels in their categories included Omni Hotels & Resorts, Homewood Suites, Drury Hotels, Hilton Garden Inn and Holiday Inn. Customer satisfaction with guest rooms in the survey has dropped within a point of its lowest level in the past seven years. A new part of the annual survey examines opinions of hotel staff. Fifty-six percent of respondents said they had a high opinion of hotel staff, 34% said average and 10% said their opinion was low.

"(CNN) -- Who knew that 70 years after African-American pilots had to work hard to overcome the prejudices of whites in the U.S. armed services, and the nation having its first black commander-in-chief, the men known as the Tuskegee Airmen would still be doing battle with an entrenched institution of white power brokers, all based on the color of their skin. Many of you may have seen the flashy commercials advertising ""Red Tails,"" the major motion picture that chronicles the amazing and true story of true American heroes: black pilots who went overseas in World War II to fight for the freedom and democracy that they could not enjoy at home. The film opens January 20 in theaters nationwide, and for its producer, George Lucas, it has been a 23-year odyssey. You would think that someone considered one of the most powerful players in Hollywood, a man who has made billions with blockbusters such as the ""Indiana Jones"" and ""Star Wars"" franchises, would have been able to get ""Red Tails"" approved without any hesitation. Yet many African-Americans have long known that in Tinseltown, the color of your skin -- or that of the people in the story you want to tell -- often falls victim to racial pigeonholing. Oh, sure, Hollywood is seen as a liberal bastion where folks talk about equality and supporting civil rights, but when it comes to telling stories that have mostly black casts, Hollywood might as well return to the '50s and '60s and erect signs that say ""Whites Only."" When Lucas approached the major Hollywood studios about backing ""Red Tails,"" he was told: Thanks, but no thanks. ""There's no major white roles in it at all ... I showed it to all of them and they said no, we don't know how to market a movie like this,"" Lucas told Jon Stewart on The Daily Show. Let's juxtapose that against some other facts: . -- In 2008, 69 million people voted for Barack Hussein Obama as president of the United States; . -- The most talked-about woman in America over the past 25 years was Oprah Winfrey, who redefined the talk show genre; . -- Which athlete has the top-selling jersey in the NBA? LeBron James; . -- Who is considered the top-grossing actor? Samuel L. Jackson; . -- Arguably the greatest entertainer of all time is Michael Jackson; . -- The greatest golfer in the world? Tiger Woods; . -- The most dominating players in women's tennis? Venus and Serena Williams; . -- The top singer today? Beyonce; . -- And hip-hop, an outgrowth of black culture, is a worldwide phenemonon. And 80% of the consumers of hip-hop music in America are white kids. So whites all across America have come to accept African-Americans in a variety of public media, but Hollywood continues to want to tell us that somehow seeing blacks on the big screen is anathema to their values. Maybe what no one in Hollywood wants to own up to is that in many ways, it is a close-minded society where it's hard to find African-Americans in positions of true power. In the history of Hollywood, no African-American has ever headed a major studio. Yes, we've seen Black CEOs at American Express, Time Warner, Xerox, Merrill Lynch, Symantec and other major companies, but the doors of opportunity are closed in Hollywood. Does this mean African-Americans aren't hired? No. But those are low-level positions where they desperately fight the good fight, knowing full well they will never ascend to the top of the food chain in Hollywood. Part of Hollywood's problem is that when looking at a movie that has, like ""Red Tails,"" a mostly black cast, it is cast as a ""black"" film. ""Red Tails"" isn't a black movie. It's a war movie. It's an action movie. It's a story of true American heroes overcoming great odds to succeed. That was the conclusion of Alabama head football coach, Nick Saban, who showed the film to his team the night before they demolished LSU for the BCS national title. Did Saban conclude it was a black film? Not at all, and he gave it a resounding endorsement. This racial fight may be new to George Lucas, but to African-Americans, this has been a long and painful battle. A few months ago on my TV One Cable Network Sunday show, Washington Watch, I talked with actor Brian White, who has starred in ""Stomp the Yard,"" ""Fighting"" and the critically-acclaimed TV show, ""Men of a Certain Age."" He told a stunning story that shows the ignorance of Hollywood regarding an independent movie he starred in with Zoe Saldana, ""The Heart Specialist."" ""Dennis Cooper, the writer, director and producer, is a Caucasian man who had some friends,"" White said. ""His friend David was the inspiration for Dr. Z and Dr. Howard -- a Harvard-educated doctor that was involved with the film. And Dennis sold this great script to the studios, but he left the character descriptions out. ""When the studios found out the leads were black, they didn't want to make the movie anymore, and Dennis had to go take his own money and his friends' money and make this movie himself and then start the long road to getting a distribution deal."" This isn't just the big studios. The Weinstein Co. produced ""The Hurricane Season,"" a basketball film about two teams coming together in the wake of Hurricane Katrina to win the Louisiana state championship. Yet the movie went straight to DVD, angering lead actor Forest Whitaker, and others in the film, including Taraji Henson, Courtney B. Vance, Isaiah Washington and the rapper Bow Wow. The excuse given the actors? The Weinstein Co. said they didn't know how to market the film. Really. A movie with basketball at the center of the story? Folks, come on! Hollywood defenders will be quick to say, what about Will Smith? Denzel Washington? Halle Berry? What's interesting in Hollywood is that if you're Will Smith, Denzel Washington or a handful of others, you really aren't seen as ""black."" For them, they have crossed the post-racial threshold, and in Hollywood's eyes, white America will watch them. But if you talk to them and so many other top Hollywood actors, they will also tell you stories of having doors slammed in their faces, and trying to get movies made featuring mostly blacks and were told, ""Can't you make the characters white?"" What is also at play is that for Hollywood, having one black guy in a film that has mostly whites is never called a white film. But if it's one or two white guys in a film with mostly blacks -- uh oh, black film! The latest excuse offered up by the Hollywood studios is that ""black films"" don't sell well overseas. What that means is that foreigners also don't want to see African-Americans. Again, I believe the problem is how the movies are categorized. Let's take two black men dressing up as women. When Martin Lawrence does it in ""Big Momma's House,"" that isn't marketed as a ""black film."" As a result, it grossed $117.5 million in the United States and $56.4 million worldwide. Yet Tyler Perry's ""Madea Goes to Jail,"" another movie featuring a black guy dressed as a grandmother, did $90 million in the U.S., and they didn't even bother to show it overseas. Maybe that's because Tyler Perry's ""Madea's Family Vacation"" only did $50,000 in ticket sales worldwide three years earlier, and $63.2 million in the U.S. Now, if Hollywood knows how to sell white men dressed as women (Robin Williams in ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" and Dustin Hoffman in ""Tootsie"") along with largely white casts, they can't figure out how to do the same for a Tyler Perry? George Lucas has clearly expressed his fears with ""Red Tails,"" hoping it opens huge so it will send a message to Hollywood that a big-budget action film with lots of black folks can be successful. The downside? If it fails, it will be seen as a failure of ALL black action films. Several Hollywood executives told me that when the Queen Latifah-Common helmed film, ""Just Wright,"" didn't meet expectations and only grossed $21.5 million -- it was marketed as a black film -- the result was a virtual shutdown of all romantic comedies featuring African-Americans. Yet Jennifer Aniston can put out failed romantic comedy after failed romantic comedy, and no one says ""white"" romantic comedies should end. Have we returned to the days of Jackie Robinson when he couldn't fail because if he did, the whole race would be set back? That's essentially what Hollywood is saying. I want you to go and see ""Red Tails"" not because it is an historical depiction of a true period in America, but because it's one helluva film. The action scenes are first rate and the storytelling is superb. Are the main characters black? Yep. Just do as I do when I go and see a movie that features an all-white cast, which is most of the time: go for the enjoyment. If so, maybe the libs in Hollywood will finally realize that great stories, when sold as such, and not as a ""black"" film, can bring people of all stripes to the movie theater. There used to be a time when whites could sit downstairs, and if blacks were allowed in the movie theater, had to sit upstairs. Today, it's clear that such a racial divide is no longer in place in the seats, but now on the screen, and that's a damn shame.","George Lucas has been on a 23-year odyssey to get ""Red Tails"" into theaters .

"(Health.com) -- Sitting in her trailer between filming scenes for ""Parenthood,"" Lauren Graham is still in hair and makeup, but dressed in what could be considered her casual uniform: a pair of stretchy jeans tucked into boots, a tank top, and a Current/Elliott denim shirt. She's nearly cornered the market on playing young, cool single moms, and it's no accident: The 43-year-old is warm, naturally pretty, and self-deprecatingly funny. But her devotion to living healthy is no joke. Today, as she eats a lean lunch of brown rice and tuna, Lauren talks to Health about staying body-confident in Hollywood, and just how she earned herself the nickname ""Bootsy."" Q: What does being healthy mean to you? Balance, and I think that is something you're always aspiring to have. Sometimes I'll think, ""That was a really nice day. I ate well, I exercised, I called some friends, wasn't working too hard,"" but I rarely have one of those. [Laughs.] They're more often, ""I'm too tired, I didn't run as far as I wanted."" And so that's something I've gained peace with. I expect now for the day to be imperfect in some way. Health.com: 25 shocking celebrity weight changes . Q: What's your go-to power meal? I guess it's protein and vegetables. I've pretty much always been on a diet since I was born. And the women in my family struggle, so I find the less I think about food, in a way, the happier I am. In general, I think I eat less the less I think about it. Q: In what areas of your life are you most and least healthy? I'm probably most healthy in exercise. I've always really liked being active. I do Spinning classes, I run, I have a trainer, I do Pilates with my sister Shade. And I think work has been an area, historically, where I've way overworked myself. Not on this job. But [in the past] I've definitely spent a lot of time worrying about work, taking jobs when I maybe could have taken some time off - really pushing myself. Although I've gotten way way way better. Q: What's your favorite healthy-life advice? Just keep moving. Someone said this to me a long time ago. It's a Buddhist saying, I think: ""There is no wasted effort."" It applies to so many things. It applies to being physical, like, ""Let's take a walk outside."" And I never go take a walk outside, but it's such a good idea! No, you didn't burn 1,000 calories, but you got up after dinner, you walked outside, had fresh air. Q: Do you have a go-to way to lose a quick few pounds? One thing I think is underrated is eating soup. I did this movie with Jeff Bridges, and I don't know if he was trying to lose weight or not, but he would carry around this thermos of soup. Also, the best investment I made in the last year was a Vitamix. You can put raw kale in the Vitamix, and you don't even taste it when you put some fruit and ice in. It comes with all these insane recipes. You can make your own peanut butter. You can grind your own flour. [Laughs.] . Q: Wow, have you done that? No. Are you kidding? But I gave one to Oliver Platt for his 50th birthday, and he was like, ""You've made the peanut butter, right?"" And I was like, ""Nooo."" I make juice. Q: Are there any ways you stay fit that are more surprising than regular workouts? I just had a vacation, and we went skiing. It was such a cool vacation because the whole day is around something active. And occasionally we'd go to the gym at night. Health.com: Celebrity-inspired workout tips . Q: You really worked out after skiing? Yeah. That's my boyfriend [co-star Peter Krause] who works out like crazy. You would go to the gym at night because you're tired, but you've worked the strangest muscles, so you don't feel like you've worked out. Q: If you're ever feeling down about your looks, how do you get the body confidence you need? Well, part of my job is pretending. And I've honestly never led with my looks. I've always thought my strengths were I'm smart, and I have a good sense of humor. I definitely struggle with feeling confident. We went to a party last night, and I always still feel like I'm in high school: ""Did I wear the right thing? Do I look OK? Did I walk funny?"" Like, I never feel comfortable, but I've done this for so long that I just know I'm not going to feel comfortable. That's not the real me, you know?

I wore something this year that I got criticized for, and [laughs] it killed me! And I was like, ""But why didn't they like it?"" You want people to feel you made the right choice. But, I am who I am. I mean, honestly, I was such a tomboy as a kid. People were taking from their mothers' closets -- I was taking from my dad's closet. It was the '80s, so it wasn't terrible, but I was wearing my dad's dress shirts over jeans from the Gap. And not the Gap now, but the Gap when it was jeans and flannel shirts. That, to me, was a really good outfit. I have more access to beautiful clothes and help, but everybody makes mistakes; that's why there are worst-dressed lists. [Laughs.] . Q: What's your go-to style now? I think it's D.C. meets California. Growing up [in D.C.], I can remember a girl coming to me and saying, ""Do you want to be preppy with me?"" And I was like, ""Yes."" Back then, you were disco or preppy. But then you come to California, and it's a little more laid back and Bohemian. My boyfriend has a friend who calls me Bootsy because I wear jeans tucked into boots 9 times out of 10! I have way too many jeans. But I never seem to have a top to wear. Q: How do you feel about plastic surgery? I don't ever plan to do it, but I don't know how I would feel. Like, if you have worked with and hung out with, as I have, Diane Keaton. She's in such good shape, you know? She, to my knowledge, has never had anything done. And why would you? She looks great, and she doesn't look fake. The standards have changed, and people do much more in that world than they used to. It's not a fair playing field, in a way. I have an interest in looking good, but I have a fear of not looking like myself. I've had much more success than I ever thought not being iconic in the beauty sense, so maybe I'll just continue to rest on my personality. [Laughs.] . Q: Is there a celebrity whose body and looks inspire you? Sandra Bullock. She looks really great and not fake. And I think she has dignity and has handled her public life really well. Q: Do you have any beauty tricks that don't come from a bottle? I really think if you're trying to look good, do something athletic. I have a little mini tramp, and sometimes I'll just try to jump for 20 minutes. It gets your blood circulating and that always looks really pretty. Q: What's your ideal Saturday night?

"Washington (CNN) -- Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 made drastic changes in altitude and direction after disappearing from civilian radar, U.S. officials told CNN on Friday, raising questions for investigators about just who was at the controls of the commercial jetliner that went missing one week ago with 239 people on board. The more the United States learns about the flight's pattern, ""the more difficult to write off"" the idea that some type of human intervention was involved, one of the officials familiar with the investigation said. The revelation comes as CNN has learned that a classified analysis of electronic and satellite data suggests the flight likely crashed either in the Bay of Bengal or elsewhere in the Indian Ocean. The analysis conducted by the United States and Malaysian governments may have narrowed the search area for the jetliner that vanished en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, leaving little trace of where it went or why. The analysis used radar data and satellite pings to calculate that the plane diverted to the west, across the Malayan peninsula, and then either flew in a northwest direction toward the Bay of Bengal or southwest into the Indian Ocean. The theory builds on earlier revelations by U.S. officials that an automated reporting system on the airliner was pinging satellites for up to five hours after its last reported contact with air traffic controllers. Inmarsat, a satellite communications company, confirmed to CNN that automated signals were registered on its network. Taken together, the data point toward speculation of a dark scenario in which someone took control of the plane for some unknown purpose, perhaps terrorism. That theory is buoyed by word from a senior U.S. official familiar with the investigation that the Malaysia Airlines plane made several significant altitude changes and altered its course more than once after losing contact with flight towers. The jetliner was flying ""a strange path,"" the official said on condition of anonymity. The details of the radar readings were first reported by The New York Times on Friday. Malaysian military radar showed the plane climbing to 45,000 feet soon after disappearing from civilian radar screens and then dropping to 23,000 feet before climbing again, the official said. The question of what happened to the jetliner has turned into one of the biggest mysteries in aviation history, befuddling industry experts and government officials. Suggestions have ranged from a catastrophic explosion to sabotage to hijacking to pilot suicide. The sabotage theory got a boost Friday from The Wall Street Journal, which reported investigators increasingly suspect the plane's communications systems were manually switched off. Investigators are trying to determine whether the satellite communications system that pinged for hours stopped functioning because ""something catastrophic happened or someone switched off"" the system, the newspaper reported, citing an unnamed person familiar with the jet's last known position. The pings stopped at a point over the Indian Ocean, while the jetliner was flying at a normal cruising altitude, according to the newspaper. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370: What we know and don't know . Movie-plot theory . Then there's the theory that maybe Flight 370 landed in a remote Indian Ocean island chain. The suggestion -- and it's only that at this point -- is based on analysis of radar data revealed Friday by Reuters suggesting that the plane wasn't just blindly flying northwest from Malaysia. Reuters, citing unidentified sources familiar with the investigation, reported that whoever was piloting the vanished jet was following navigational waypoints that would have taken the plane over the Andaman Islands. The radar data don't show the plane over the Andaman Islands, but only on a known route that would take it there, Reuters cited its sources as saying. The movie-plot theory seems more complicated and unlikely than one in which the plane -- its flight crew perhaps incapacitated -- simply flew on until it ran out of fuel or faced some other problem. But it's one that law enforcement has to check out, former FBI Assistant Director James Kallstrom said. Timeline of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 . Aviation experts say it's possible, if highly unlikely, that someone could have hijacked and landed the giant Boeing 777 undetected. The international airport in Port Blair, the regional capital of the Andaman and Nicobar islands, has a runway that is long enough to accommodate a 777, according to publicly available data. But the region is highly militarized because of its strategic importance to India, Indian officials with knowledge of the operation tell CNN, making it an unlikely target for pirates trying to sneak in an enormous airplane with a wingspan of more than 200 feet. Denis Giles, editor of the Andaman Chronicle newspaper, says there's just nowhere to land such a big plane in his archipelago without attracting notice. ""There is no chance, no such chance, that any aircraft of this size can come towards Andaman and Nicobar Islands and land,"" he said. The Malaysian government said Friday that it can't confirm the report. And a senior U.S. official offered a conflicting account Thursday, telling CNN that ""there is probably a significant likelihood"" the plane is on the bottom of the Indian Ocean. Among the things being considered is whether lithium batteries in the cargo hold, which have been blamed in previous crashes, played a role in the disappearance, according to U.S. officials briefed on the latest developments in the investigation. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release details to the media. If the batteries being carried on the plane caused a fire, it still doesn't fully explain other anomalies with Flight 370, the officials say. What is a transponder? Details of the search . Malaysian officials, who are coordinating the search, said Friday that the hunt for the plane was spreading deeper into both the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. India has deployed assets from its navy, coast guard and air force to the south Andaman Sea to take part in the search, the country's Ministry of Defense said Friday. Indian search teams are combing large areas of the archipelago. Two aircraft are searching land and coastal areas of the island chain from north to south, an Indian military spokesman said Friday, and two coast guard ships have been diverted to search along the islands' east coast. Indian officials are also including part of the Bay of Bengal in their search, officials said. As of Friday, 57 ships and 48 aircraft from 13 countries were involved in the search, Hishammuddin Hussein, the minister in charge of defense and transportation, said at a news briefing. China, which said it would be extending its search, said crews have searched more than 27,000 square miles (about 70,000 square kilometers) of the South China Sea without finding anything. On Friday, the United States sent the destroyer USS Kidd to scout the Indian Ocean as the search expands into that body of water. ""I, like most of the world, really have never seen anything like this,"" Cmdr. William Marks of the U.S. 7th Fleet said of the scale of the search. ""It's pretty incredible."" ""It's a completely new game now,"" he said. ""We went from a chess board to a football field."" Malaysia Airlines: The pilots of the missing plane . Other developments . â€¢ ""Seafloor event"": Chinese researchers say they recorded a ""seafloor event"" in waters around Malaysia and Vietnam about an hour and a half after the missing plane's last known contact. The event was recorded in a non-seismic region about 116 kilometers (72 miles) northeast of the plane's last confirmed location, the University of Science and Technology of China said. ""Judging from the time and location of the two events, the seafloor event may have been caused by MH370 crashing into the sea,"" said a statement posted on the university's website. However, U.S. Geological Survey earthquake scientist Harley Benz said Friday that the event appeared to be consistent with a naturally occurring 2.7-magnitude earthquake. â€¢ Malaysian response: Authorities continued to defend their response to the crash. ""A normal investigation becomes narrower with time, I understand, as new information focuses the search,"" Hussein said. ""But this is not a normal investigation. In this case, the information we have forces us to look further and further afield."" However, Bob Francis, a former National Transportation Safety Board official, is one of several experts who have questioned how Malaysian authorities have handled the situation. ""The Malaysians are not doing a superb job of running this investigation,"" he said. ""And they apparently give you some information, and then they withhold information. How much are they relying on and listening to the Europeans and the NTSB who are there with more expertise? I don't know, but I think you know we've got a mixture of a very strange situation that happens to be in an environment, a regulatory environment, that really isn't capable or isn't running an investigation the way it should be run.""

"(CNN) -- Packed tight into wire baskets -- sometimes 20 or more to a cage -- animal rights activists say as many as 200,000 live dogs every year are smuggled from northeast Thailand across the Mekong River destined for restaurants in Vietnam. Dehydrated, stressed, some even dying of suffocation on the trip, the dogs are often stacked 1,000 to a truck on a journey that lasts for days. ""Obviously when you've got dogs stacked on top of each other they start biting each other because they are so uncomfortable, any kind of movement then the dog next to the one that's being crushed is going to bite back,"" said Tuan Bendixsen, director of Animals Asia Foundation Vietnam, a Hanoi-based animal welfare group. When they arrive in Vietnam, the suffering doesn't end there. A common belief is that stress and fear releases hormones that improve the taste of the meat, so the dogs are placed in stress cages that restrict their movement. Eventually, the dogs are either bludgeoned to death or have their throats cut in front of other dogs who are awaiting the same fate. In some cases, they've been known to be skinned alive. ""Dogs are highly intelligent animals so if you kill a dog and you have a whole cage of dogs next to the one that's being killed, those dogs that are going to be killed next know what's going on,"" Bendixsen said. According to animal rights groups, dog smugglers round up everything from family pets to Thailand's ubiquitous strays -- known as soi dogs -- to sell the animals in Vietnam, or even as far away as China where a pedigree dog can fetch a premium price. John Dalley of the Phuket-based Soi Dog Foundation estimates 98% of the dogs are domesticated and that some are even still wearing collars and have been trained and respond to commands. ""You can see all types of pedigree animals in these captured Thai shipments -- golden retrievers, long-haired terriers, you name it,"" says Dalley. ""Some are bought. Others are snatched from streets, temples, and even people's gardens."" In the past, batches of stray dogs were traded for plastic buckets, but these days with demand soaring -- especially in the winter months when dog meat is regarded as a ""warming"" food -- a dog in Thailand can fetch up to $10. This figure jumps to around $60 once they are served up in restaurants in Vietnam. Dalley says pet dogs, in particular, are targeted because they are friendlier and easier to catch. Animal rights activists estimate that more than one million dogs are eaten each year in Vietnam; for the dog smugglers of the Mekong, business is booming. While the trade is illegal in Thailand, and authorities have made a number of raids involving thousands of dogs, dog traders claim the laws are unclear and have even mounted counter protests against a series of crackdowns. Smugglers are normally prosecuted under laws that prohibit the illegal trade and transportation of animals and, with no direct animal cruelty laws in Thailand, prosecutors attempt to charge smugglers with cruelty under Criminal Code laws. The Soi Dog Foundation and the Thai Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals are fighting to change that and are currently working through the Department of Livestock Development to get an Animal Welfare Draft Law through the Thai Parliament. The reality, however, is that smugglers often receive light sentences of just a few months in jail. Animal activists also say thousands of impounded dogs -- rescued from smugglers -- that end up in quarantine centers sometimes find their way back onto the streets and in the dog meat circle again. ""This is not about whether it is right or wrong to eat dog meat,"" Dalley says. ""It is about an illegal trade worth millions of dollars per year organized by criminals. The way in which these dogs are transported and, if they survive, killed, is horrific. ""Some of the footage we receive is so horrific it's too strong even for the media to run. It's so inhumane ... it's quite literally hell on earth.""","Dog smuggling is booming in Thailand around the Mekong border region with Laos .

"(CNN) -- On Thursday, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta announced that the Obama administration would allow women to be placed in positions that will expose them more directly to fighting with enemy ground forces. It is said that this will allow women to fill hundreds of thousands of combat roles from which they are currently excluded. Substantively, this is a poor idea. Furthermore, the decision-making process used to bring this change about is deeply flawed. America's ongoing war against terror-supporting states and terror networks, commenced after 9/11, has seen an increased combat role for women in the U.S. armed forces. According to recent news accounts, more than 800 have been wounded and more than 130 have died. Clearly, women have fought honorably, bravely and with great distinction. The greater inclusion of women has allowed our armed forces to tap into an enormous pool of talent and character. And as the casualty figures above indicate, the current posture of the U.S. armed forces is not one in which women are leading cloistered, sheltered lives. They are often exposed to great danger. So, what is it then that President Obama and Panetta are doing? Under the policy, women may end up being placed in infantry and Special Forces battalions and other front line combat units. To doubt the wisdom of this action does not reflect on the courage or abilities of female service members. But the step crosses a line worthy of greater deliberation and public debate. Opinion: The challenge of incorporating women into the infantry . The proof that this decision is ideologically and not militarily based is its very sweeping nature. It appears that the people who did this are engaged in a vast social experiment in which hundreds of thousands of men and women will be the guinea pigs. We are now testing a hypothesis that may impair the military effectiveness of our ground forces. The slots that may be opened are in our infantry and Special Forces units. The purpose of such units is to directly and physically engage enemy forces. This can often involve personal, hand-to-hand combat in which women will now have to fight men. These units can often be deployed in prolonged operations that can last for months. The physical toll is constant and wearing. During operations of this kind there is typically no access to a base of operations or facilities. Consequently, living conditions can be abysmal and base. There is routinely no privacy or ability to maintain personal hygiene for extended periods. Soldiers and Marines have to relieve themselves within sight of others. Think back to those scenes of combat in Vietnam, the Pacific in World War II, or the frozen mountains of Korea. It isn't pretty, and the same is happening now in Afghanistan. Rangel: A more equal military? Bring back draft . This combat environment -- now containing males and females -- will place a tremendous burden on combat commanders. Not only will they have to maintain their focus on defeating the enemy in battle, they will have to do so in an environment that combines life-threatening danger with underlying sexual tensions. This is a lot to ask of the young leaders, both men and women, who will have to juggle the need to join and separate the sexes within the context of quickly developing and deadly situations. Is the experiment worth placing this burden on small unit leaders? I think it is asking too much. Something as momentous as this should be endorsed by the Congress of the United States. Ideas like these have been percolating within corners of the Defense Department for years waiting to be unleashed. One study by the Congressional Research Service recommended that ""women should be excluded from direct land combat units and positions."" Now, ideologues within the bureaucracy have prevailed, but a volunteer force has to maintain its legitimacy with the wider public. That is why the Constitution gives the Congress the power to shape and structure the military. I worry about the women who are currently in the military. They have to know that the lines keeping them from infantry and Special Forces battalions will get blurrier and blurrier. What protections will they have against being thrown into front-line infantry units as organizational dividers soften and expectations change? Very little protection, I am afraid. Will they leave the military? This policy change may have the ironic effect of forcing women to reconsider their place in the armed services. If true, that would be tragic. By the numbers: Women in the U.S. military . Congress should examine what the Department of Defense is doing here -- really. The Congress must do some hard, nonideological work and assess job categories and physical requirements. Perhaps a special committee could be formed whose members actually served in the infantry and Special Forces. If it will not reverse the policy, then Congress needs to put in place a comprehensive, nonpoliticized system that will track the physical effects of these changes on women. The data needs to be made public, so there can be a fair, scientific assessment of this great experiment. President Obama and Panetta have their agenda of change and transformation. The American public, however, should not sit back and leave the brave members of our armed forces susceptible to the whims of ideology. Men and women can serve together in the armed forces productively, but that service needs to be prudently structured in a manner that reflects the differences between the sexes and the power of their attractions. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jerry Boykin.","Lt. Gen. Jerry Boykin: Allowing women to fill combat roles is a deeply flawed idea .

"New York (CNN) -- The massacre in Newtown brought back an old memory -- a day in the 1970s when as a 12-year-old French school boy I had held my first gun. On a Wednesday, a short school day in France, one of my classmates had brought a whole group of kids to his house. The parents were away at the office so we tasted a few drops of his dad's Scotch, checked out his older brother's collection of Playboy magazine, then, as if we needed to complete our transgressions, our young host led us upstairs, opened a drawer in the master bedroom, and pulled out this mass of black metal. Many of us had seen our grandfathers' hunting rifles, but this was the real thing -- designed to pierce big holes in human bodies. And as we passed the gun along, some of us refused to touch it. The weapon conveyed less the glamorous image of Hollywood thrillers than the ghastly and realistic press account of the end of a gangster, riddled with bullets by the police in the middle of Paris a few weeks before. Will Newtown change America's attitude toward guns? It also brought back the story a teacher had told us about the sound he had heard as a child in World War II, of German SS soldiers finishing off hostages one by one in a courtyard of his village. As we left the house that day, we all had the strange feeling we had just met the ultimate taboo, an instrument of ugly death belonging either to a dark underworld, or to a higher and overpowering authority. As a reporter in the United States, I sometimes had to smile at my prudish European state of mind, when I saw, for example, members of the Blood gang in Los Angeles casually eating their pizza, their guns visible in their belts, or every time I pass by the weapons counter at Walmart where families buy guns as if they were shopping for the nearby kitchen appliances. To a foreigner, the horror of Columbine, the abyss of Newtown may bring another surprise -- the unbelievable ease with which the perpetrators have gathered their arsenal, their casual expertise in using it as an extension of their mundane anxieties, the bloody resolution of trivial problems at home with mom and dad. The European press as a whole may have once again stigmatized ""America's love story with its guns"" but the story seems to be less about love or passion than about the amazing familiarity and trivialization of instruments of death displayed by Americans. On Friday, a relative called me from France. A retired kindergarten teacher, she told me about the ""gut wrenching pain"" she had felt following the news of faraway Connecticut. As we ended our conversation, she wondered: ""Are we that far behind them?"" Sure, a few months ago, a young French jihadist named Mohammed Merah massacred children in a Jewish school in Toulouse. In peaceful Norway, a neo-Nazi went on a nightmarish rampage. But both plans stemmed from another world, that of terrorism -- a warrior's logic so determined and deeply rooted in ideology it defied any norm of the society it targeted. In France, the last mass shooting comparable to the recent American random murders dates back to 2002, when a Richard Durn gunned down eight members of the city council of his home town of Nanterre, a suburb of Paris. And the only known equivalent of Columbine, Virginia Tech or Newtown took place in Dunblane, Scotland, in March 1996 when a former scout leader killed 16 children and one adult in a school. Yet, why doesn't it happen more often? One explanation comes to mind. It is way more difficult to find an efficient weapon in Europe, and this challenge may deter all but the most determined potential murderers. I concur with the American gun lobby that gun control amounts to an obvious restriction of individual liberties. Like most French or European citizens, I would add a point: So what? Who even cares that, barring some (even more restrictive) amendments added since the 1980s, most of our gun laws date back to the decrees of April 18, 1939. It was a time of official mobilization against Hitler's imminent offensive, a time when a derelict French government cared less about its citizens killing each other than about the populace, or political factions, turning their weapons against the state for an insurrection. For the next four years, the occupants, and the collaborationist regime of Vichy, simplified the system by executing anybody found in possession of a mere hunting rifle. And after the war, the legitimate government made an absolute priority of collecting the assault weapons hidden in private attics all around the country and reaffirming the 1939 law. It is still in place. There are eight categories of weapon, ranging from automatic hardware and machine guns which are prohibited, to hunting equipment allowed with a hunting permit. To get any category one or four weapons, like the Glock or the Sig Sauer used in Newtown, you need to be 21, to have joined a shooting range for the last six months, provided a blank criminal record and a certificate of physical and mental health not older than two weeks. Then, the local police precinct starts a ""morality investigation"" in your neighborhood that rivals the clearance work done by the FBI for anybody employed at the White House. One more point. Once you buy a gun, you still don't own it. Property rights don't apply to weapons. Even the European community, in spite of its principles of free enterprise and individual liberties, confirmed that there is no such thing as a right to own a weapon. A license is a temporary exception to the rule of prohibition. It is a privilege revoked after three years, before a new application. World reaction: 'My heart is in Newtown' These are the rules, but they are just rules. But our fear and taboos about firearms are a much more efficient gun control in our society. The laws are so strict they cannot be efficiently implemented. That is why, mostly for bureaucratic reasons, more than 16 million weapons are unaccounted for and kept illegally, according to Small Arms Survey, mostly by otherwise law-abiding French citizens. Still, per capita, our murder rate is a fraction of the American one. This doesn't mean France is not growing more violent. Its underworld is changing and expanding fast. Gangsters now use RPGs [rocket-propelled grenades] and bazookas to attack bank trucks, and military grade fully automatic weapons to kill their guards. Drug dealers execute their competitors in Marseille with dreadful impunity. The Corsican mob, or its independent networks have killed 20 people in the island in a year. Thousands of military grade weapons are flowing now in western Europe, the remnants of the recent Balkan wars, exported by corrupt officials all around the former eastern block. A few blocks from the house where I first saw my first gun, teenage dealers stash Kalashnikovs in the basements of project buildings. They are still rarely used, and to most French people, they belong in a parallel world. For now. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Philippe Coste.","Philippe Coste says Americans display amazing familiarity with instruments of death .

"(CNN) -- I'm not a violent man. Short, self-doubting gingers tend not to be the fiercest of creatures. But if you are sitting next to me on a plane I will absolutely fight you for the armrest. Mind you, when I say ""fight,"" I mean ""create a mental checklist of things I would do to you in the event that I suddenly ceased to be a short, self-doubting ginger."" So, you're safe. Sadly, when it comes to hand-to-hand combat, my signature move is silent resignation. Thus, when it comes to armrests, I resort to strategy and the early boarding benefits bestowed upon me by virtue of having an airline credit card. Don't scoff at early boarding. I'd sooner give up my pants than Zone 1. Truthfully, though, you can just have my pants. Of course, there are a number of other great reasons for boarding early -- the big one being that I'm able to quickly secure my bag in an overhead compartment before they all fill up with the four-wheeled shipping containers some of you now feel qualify as a small personal item. But it's definitely also about getting seated and into the ready position. Which is to say: Body wide. Muscles clenched. Armrests secured. ""Claimed!"" Nothing greedy. Just simply taking what's rightfully mine in accordance with the rules. And there are rules. In Season One (episode four) of the brilliant TV series ""Legit,"" comedian Jim Jefferies perfectly details these rules from his middle seat as he battles another passenger for the right to be mildly more comfortable. ""You don't know plane etiquette,"" Jefferies shouts to the man sitting to his left. ""Window gets an armrest and a wall. Middle gets two armrests. Aisle gets an armrest and a little bit of extra leg. We're not animals! We live in a society!"" So, those are the rules. Not that any of you are going to follow them. Fortunately, however, there's a new armrest design that may settle the matter once and for all. It's called the Paperclip Armrest, and throughout the week it seemed to be popping up all over the Web and social media. Apparently armrest inequality is quite the hot-button issue, so it struck a nerve with anyone who's ever had a boarding pass that included the letter B or E. The Hong Kong-based team at Paperclip Design claim their innovation solves the ""perennial problem of fighting for elbow room in high-density seating"" by using ""double-deck geometry."" The basic idea is this: . Paperclip's armrest extends out as normal but then, at the end, it curls up several inches and fishhooks back for several more, making use of the ""vertical space"" to create a second deck. So, one person gets the lower. And one person takes the upper. Sadly, this does not qualify you for the Mile High Club. All that said, I still think the design has a critical flaw. You see, while the person using the upper deck is mostly getting support for his or her forearm, the person using the lower deck gets to position the entirety of his or her elbow directly on the rest. And that's important. Comfort starts in the elbow. Later, in the same scene from that episode of ""Legit,"" the man arguing with Jim Jefferies eventually says, ""I am only taking the back of the armrest. You can have all the rest."" Jefferies drives home the importance of the elbow by replying, ""You take the back, you take the whole damn thing."" So, the Paperclip Armrest might not be a perfect design -- I'm certainly not convinced -- but it does seem to be a start. However, until we finally sort it out, we're just going to have to obey the rules and force them upon those who act like animals. Which is to say: Body wide. Muscles clenched. Armrests secured.

"(CNN) -- The last few days have perfectly encapsulated the House of Representatives under Republican leadership. On Wednesday, House Republicans took the unprecedented action of voting to sue the President for doing his job and taking action to stand up for the American people. Then on Thursday, after Republican leadership failed to bring immigration legislation to the floor for a vote, the GOP House leadership wrote: ""There are numerous steps the President can and should be taking right now, without need for congressional action. ..."" Baffled? So am I! Sue the President for doing his job one day; ask him to do their job for them the next. The hypocrisy is difficult to fathom. But somehow, it gets worse. Their struggle to get a bill to the floor and failure to pass legislation that adequately addresses the crisis at the border wouldn't be unusual for this do-nothing Congress, except that we are coming up on the August recess, when members will leave Washington behind and return to work in their districts. While my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are home, I doubt they'll find their constituents very happy that Congress spent one of our last few days in session voting to use their taxpayer dollars to sue the President. Nor will they be impressed that we stayed in town an extra night so we could vote on a bill that would weaken the due process for children. Voters are tired of the Republican obsession with obstruction. They are fed up with the more than 50 votes to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act, and they don't appreciate that Republicans shut down the government over it, too. They don't want Congress to waste more time and taxpayer money holding redundant hearings on Benghazi. But that's all the Republican House is offering them. Democrats have an agenda that is actually in line with the priorities of America's families. We have a plan that will jump start the middle class and strengthen economic security for all Americans. I know our members will hear from workers who agree with Democrats that we need to create jobs that pay good wages and extend opportunities to join the middle class. No one who works full time should have to raise their family in poverty. We've seen in states across the country that increasing the minimum wage boosts the economy and creates jobs by putting more money in workers' pockets to spend. That's why Democrats will fight for an increase. With more women acting as their family's primary breadwinner -- about 40% in households with children -- there's also public support for Republicans to join Democrats in passing the Paycheck Fairness Act. Equal pay isn't just a woman's issue; it's an economic issue. There are many issues Congress could address that would actually help America's middle-class families: making greater investments in education, easing the burden of student loan debt, and taking action to hold off the looming threat of climate change. And on one of our nation's most pressing issues, immigration reform, the GOP's insistence on adhering to rigid ideology, as well as putting their partisan stunts over real action that would help our country, is alarmingly apparent. If House Republicans were serious about addressing immigration reform, they could let us vote on the bipartisan Senate bill or fund President Obama's border request. Instead, they have been fumbling with legislation that would hurt the immigrant community and make progress on actual reform more difficult. This August, when I'm home in my district, I know I'll be asked why Congress is wasting time and money suing the President instead of finding solutions to the pressing issues that our nation faces. The only answer I can give them is that Republican leadership in the House cares more about scoring political points against the President than they do about helping America's middle-class families. It's not an answer I'm proud of, and I don't think voters will be happy with it either. But come November, Americans will have a chance to choose leaders who are looking out for them and focused on finding real solutions to real problems by casting their ballots for Democrats.

"(CNN) -- Richard ""Dick"" Trickle -- who parlayed a legendary reputation as a short-track driver into a full-time career on stock car racing's biggest stages in the 1990s -- died Thursday of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, a North Carolina sheriff's office said. He was 71. A Lincoln County dispatcher received a call -- believed to have been placed by Trickle -- that ""there would be a dead body and it would be his,"" that county's sheriff's office said in a news release. There was no answer when authorities tried to call the number back. Emergency units went to Forest Lawn Cemetery in Boger City and found a body lying near Trickle's pickup truck. The Wisconsin-born Trickle raced during the 1970s and 1980s, then broke through as a full-time and widely recognized NASCAR driver in 1989. By that time, according to a Sports Illustrated article, the 48-year-old grandfather of two had won some 1,200 stock car competitions in 31 years of racing. He settled in Lincoln County, in central North Carolina, in the early 1990s, according to the sheriff's office. Though Trickle never managed a victory in NASCAR's premier Sprint Cup series, he did have 15 top-five finishes and won two Nationwide Series races before his retirement in 2002. Some got to know him thanks to frequent references on ESPN's SportsCenter, with then co-anchor Keith Olbermann tweeting Thursday that ""no sports figure Dan (Patrick and) I had fun with took it more graciously. In fact, gratefully."" In a statement Thursday, NASCAR Chairman and CEO Brian France described Trickle as ""a legend in the short-track racing community, particularly in his home state of Wisconsin, and he was a true fan favorite."" ""Personalities like Dick Trickle helped shape our sport,"" France said. ""He will be missed."" Past and present NASCAR drivers, like Mark Martin, similarly reacted with sadness Thursday to the news.

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States has lifted its ban on U.S. carriers flying to and from Tel Aviv, Israel. The Federal Aviation Administration's move came Wednesday night, a day and a half after it imposed the prohibition over security concerns amid renewed Mideast violence. Airlines moved quickly to restore service. Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and US Airways said Thursday they are resuming flights to Israel's busiest airport, Ben Gurion International. The European Aviation Safety Agency also has reversed its recommendation that airlines avoid flying to Ben Gurion. Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, lobbied Washington to reverse the extraordinary order the FAA put in place after a Hamas rocket struck close to the airport Tuesday. Many international airlines followed suit, canceling flights to and from Tel Aviv. The FAA said it had worked with other U.S. government agencies and officials to assess security in Israel and ""carefully reviewed"" new information and measures Israel was taking to ""mitigate potential risks to civil aviation."" Two U.S. officials said Thursday the facts on the ground in Tel Aviv are the same as they were before the FAA freeze was put into place, but Israel has shared more information about airport defenses. A State Department official said ""the circumstances in Tel Aviv from 72 hours ago are no different than the circumstances now."" Another U.S. official cautioned that people in Washington are keeping a close eye on the situation in Tel Aviv and ""if this goes south the ban could go back into place."" Sources told CNN that the FAA, the U.S. intelligence community and other government agencies have been in intense discussions with Israel since the ban was put into the place. ""There was significant new information about the threat -- new information/intelligence about the threat which they took into account, which led to the rescinding of this notice, and also measures -- new measures the government of Israel put in place to mitigate potential risks to civilian aircraft and aviation,"" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Thursday. But the U.S. official said lifting of the ban ""was not so much new intelligence as much as it is a better understanding of the planes going into and out of the airport."" The Israelis improved certain protocols and procedures after the ban and were able to share new information with Washington about their defense capabilities that convinced the United States to resume air service into Israel, the official said. ""We had a higher comfort level with the way they proposed to mitigate the threat we were seeing and it was satisfactory enough to allow airliners to resume,"" the official said. While U.S. airlines operate only a handful of flights per day to Israel, FAA safety directives are influential worldwide and can affect future bookings. Air Canada said it would start flying to Israel again Thursday night, according to its verified Twitter account. Spain's Iberia Airlines also announced that it would resume flying to Ben Gurion. ""We are operating this flight with a bigger plane than we usually fly: an Airbus A330 with 278 seats,"" double the usual capacity, an Iberia spokeswoman said via e-mail. British Airways never stopped its twice-daily flights, it said. The Lufthansa Group, which includes Austrian Airlines and Swiss International Air Lines, has canceled flights through Friday. Ban openly questioned . The FAA ban was openly questioned by the Israeli government and sharply criticized by some high-profile U.S. political figures. They included former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who flew to Tel Aviv and made his point bluntly on CNN, and Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, who said he believed the step was imposed to pressure Israel into a cease-fire. But Antony Blinken, the deputy White House national security adviser, insisted to CNN's Wolf Blitzer that politics played no role in the decision. ""We didn't use the FAA to do anything. The FAA makes independent judgments for safety and security of our airline passengers and for our airlines,"" Blinken said. ""They made a judgment, and we're not in the business of second-guessing the FAA or overturning what they do."" Also speaking to Blitzer after flying to Israel on its flag carrier, El Al, Bloomberg said the FAA ban had been a mistake. ""We certainly don't want to stop flights into airports in America,"" he said. ""It would be devastating for America. It's devastating for Israel when you stop flights.""

On ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" Wednesday night, host Kimmel concocted a small get-together between Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox and Lisa Kudrow. With Aniston as his guest, Kimmel admitted to being a huge ""Friends"" follower in the '90s -- so much so that he's even written some fan fiction. In Kimmel's version of the NBC sitcom, he's Ross, and Rachel (Aniston), Monica (Cox) and Phoebe (Kudrow) can't stop talking about his impressive ""lovemaking."" It may sound dumb -- especially since Monica and Ross were siblings on ""Friends"" -- but as Kimmel replied to Aniston's criticism, ""Is it dumber than living in a huge apartment in New York City for eight years, even though you work at a coffee shop?"" Point taken. Before long, Aniston and Kimmel's re-enactment of ""Friends"" -- on a replica of the set, no less -- was boosted by the appearances of Cox and Kudrow. Where were their male co-stars, Matt LeBlanc (who played Joey) and Matthew Perry (who played Chandler)? Kimmel had them killed off. But as the 20th anniversary of the debut of ""Friends"" nears -- the pilot episode aired September 22, 1994 -- longtime devotees may not be satisfied with one-half of the cast making an appearance. Yet the actors themselves, from Aniston and LeBlanc to Kudrow, have warned fans to lower their expectations. In April, Cox told David Letterman that a full ""Friends"" reunion was pretty unlikely, considering she couldn't even get all of the stars in one place for dinner. ""It's not gonna happen,"" Cox told the ""Late Show"" host. ""I've been trying to put together a cast dinner for 10 years. It doesn't happen. I can get the girls to come, maybe Matthew Perry. Matt LeBlanc canceled last time right at the last minute, (David) Schwimmer lives here (in New York). ... So it's not gonna happen.""

"(CNN) -- Not many opponents have come close to beating Serena Williams in recent months, but the tennis star had to overcome her own ""super crazy"" hair to win her first match since claiming double Olympic glory. The world No. 4 continued her imperious recent run with a 6-3 6-4 win against Greek qualifier Eleni Daniilidou at the WTA Tour's Cincinnati Open for her 35th victory in 36 singles matches. Williams has won singles and doubles Olympic gold at London 2012 and the Bank of West Classic since being crowned Wimbledon champion for a fifth time last month. However, the second seed was left frustrated after making 44 unforced errors against Daniilidou on Tuesday as she began preparations for another tilt at her home U.S. Open later this month. Supreme Serena gets golden slam . ""That's shocking. It's unprofessional. Hopefully I clean up my act for my next match,"" the 30-year-old told the WTA Tour's website ahead of her last-16 clash with either Poland's Urszula Radwanska or Kazakh qualifier Yaroslava Shevdova -- who she beat in the last 16 at Wimbledon. On her hairstyle, Williams remarked: ""I need to calm it down. It's really big. It was a little windy, so it was getting in my face, and I put it in this '80s scrunchie I happened to have. ""The look isn't new. I've just let it go super natural and super crazy and not care. It's fun."" Opinion: Why focus on Gabby Douglas' hair? Williams has won 66 singles and doubles titles in her career, but the 14-time grand slam champion was a little unsure about where Cincinnati featured in her resume. ""I've won this tournament. I have. When it wasn't this big. But it counts,"" the American said before reconsidering. ""I did win this tournament, didn't I? ""Maybe I didn't. I can't keep up. I don't think I did. Okay, whoops. Yeah, I didn't win this tournament. I thought I did. I really thought I did."" Williams' older sister Venus, her gold medal-winning doubles partner at London 2012, is also yet to win the hard-court tournament. The former world No. 1 has struggled in recent years with injury and illness, having been diagnosed with Sjogren's Syndrome during last year's U.S. Open. But the wild-card entrant battled past Russia's 12th seed Maria Kirilenko 6-3 6-7(5-7) 6-2 in her first-round match before discussing her ongoing health problems and her ambition to play in a fifth Olympic Games in 2016. ""I'm trying different things all the time,"" said the 32-year-old seven-time grand slam winner. ""I keep working with my doctors. ""Nothing can prevent bad days, but the bad days aren't as bad as they used to be. Now I realize I have to hang in there if I'm not having the best day. My main goal is to be 100%, but it's not like it goes away. ""It's still in my body trying to fight against me, but I'm fighting against it as well ... I can't wait until Rio. I'm very excited about Rio. That will probably be my last one. By that time I'll be creeping up in age."" Samantha Stosur, who beat Serena Williams in last year's U.S. Open final to win her first grand slam title, survived a spirited fightback from Spain's Anabel Medina Garrigues to win 6-3 6-7(6-8) 6-4 in Cincinnati and also reach the last 16. The third seed let match point slip in a second-set tie-break and fell 4-0 behind in the decider before rallying to win six games in a row. ""It was an interesting third set considering the whole match was really quite close,"" said the Australian. ""There were no breaks in the second set, and then straight away I got myself in quite a hole quite quickly. ""I thought I could still regroup and close that gap just a little bit, and if you do that, you never know what can happen. I got on a roll and managed to squeeze it out."" In the men's tournament, 2003 U.S. Open champion Andy Roddick is out after injuring his back during a 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 defeat to French lucky loser Jeremy Chardy. The former world No. 1 now faces a race against time to fit for the Flushing Meadows grand slam. ""I just had a little bit of a back issue the other day in practice,"" the 29-year-old told the ATP Tour's website. ""I was supposed to play yesterday and we had a late request to delay it. I felt fine early on, and then I had one lunge forehand and, we have all had it, your back kind of goes out or spasms a little bit. It got progressively worse."" Meanwhile, American 10th seed Mardy Fish began his campaign with a straight-sets win over Spaniard Feliciano Lopez, while his compatriot Sam Querrey set up a meeting with Britain's defending champion Andy Murray -- the Olympic singles gold medalist -- by beating Austria's Jurgen Melzer.

And away from tennis, there is Danica Patrick, the only woman to win an IndyCar race and a big drawcard for motorsport sponsors. In fact, it is Li Na, the world No. 7 women's tennis player and winner of a single grand slam title in a 13-year career. But that surprise victory at the French Open almost a year ago transformed Li into one of the world's most marketable athletes. According to Forbes.com, she earned $18 million to April 2012 (up $10 million from 2011) -- $8 million shy of Sharapova's total but $5 million more than third-placed Williams. So why are brands scrambling to associate with Li, who will defend her title at Roland Garros when the clay-court major starts on Sunday. ""Two words: She's Chinese,"" says Simon Chadwick, Professor of Sport Business Strategy and Marketing at Coventry University Business School in Britain. ""Li Na is out there on her own, firstly in terms of being a female Chinese sportsperson and secondly in terms of her international profile and success."" The fact that Li plays tennis -- a traditionally middle-class sport -- is also in her favor. ""China has now become the biggest market for luxury brands in the world and there is this kind of convergence between luxury brands and tennis,"" Chadwick told CNN. ""The kind of people who are interested in those brands are also interested in tennis, so Li Na is a very convenient way of aligning the two."" Li's agent Max Eisenbud, who also represents Sharapova, spotted the potential in 2009 when he signed her to IMG's books. He concedes that although he thought she had top-five potential, he didn't necessarily expect her to be a grand slam winner. But at age 29, and in her 20th major tournament, Li beat Francesca Schiavone to become the first Chinese player to win a grand slam singles title and set off a chain of events that had Eisenbud working overnight from a makeshift office to stay in touch with his colleagues in Beijing while the offers flooded in. ""She's basically the Billie Jean King of China,"" Eisenbud told CNN. ""She broke down so many barriers. ""She was the first -- and it's weird that you can say that in 2012 -- that there's somewhere in the world that they just don't have a rich tradition of sports heroes. ""I think that was very cool to see: that the win was a lot bigger than tennis."" Li has signed seven new sponsorship deals since her Roland Garros triumph. Among them are luxury car maker Mercedes Benz and Chinese insurance company Taikang Life Insurance Co. Eisenbud even managed to negotiate a special deal with Nike to allow Li to wear patches on her clothing -- something not usually permitted by the American sportswear giant. ""I think we did a good job on a hybrid of global brands that could potentially use Li Na to help get a footing in China and then we also wanted to associate with some great Chinese brands,"" he said. Eisenbud estimates they could have signed up to seven more deals, but with his experience of managing Sharapova's money-making potential after her 2004 Wimbledon win, he was wary of compromising Li's tennis career. Li won only six more matches in 2011 after the French Open final, going out in the second round at Wimbledon and the first hurdle at the U.S. Open. She has been more like her old self in 2012, reaching two finals, most recently at the Italian Open where she lost out to Sharapova over three sets. ""I liked the way I hit on court,"" she said afterwards. ""A lot of positive things and I think I am ready for the French Open."" The reality is that financially at least, it really doesn't matter how Li performs at Roland Garros this time around. She was already nearing the end of her career when she won the title and the deals were negotiated with that in mind. What IMG and Li's team has done is what Chadwick calls ""short-term harvesting."" ""It's to make as much money as possible in the period of time they've got left before she retires,"" said the academic. ""The French Open was all she needed because we're still talking about it now, that's proof that's all she needed."" Which begs the question: would any Chinese player have had the same earning potential as Li had they become the first major winner from the world's most populous country? Maybe not. Chadwick says Li's added value comes from the fact that she rejected the Chinese state-run sports system, while Eisenbud describes as her ""little bit of rebel."" That little bit of rebelliousness is most visible in the red rose tattoo she sports on her chest. ""In Western terms, marketers talk about brand personality,"" Chadwick said. ""And she does have some personality to her, the whole thing about her tattoo, the crazy things she says about her husband (who Li has publicly berated for his snoring)."" ""Effectively what Li Na does is give these Western brands a direct route into the Chinese marketplace, which is a notoriously difficult and complex country to do business in."" Li joked in August last year that she still used her husband Jian Shang's credit card when she went shopping because she liked to save money. If Jian ever needs a loan to pay off the bill, he need look no further than his multimillionaire wife.","Chinese tennis star Li Na Earned $18 million to April 2012 .

"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (CNN) -- The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has filed genocide charges against Sudan's president for a five-year campaign of violence in Darfur. The U.N. estimates 2.5 million have been forced from their homes in Darfur. Luis Moreno-Ocampo on Monday urged a three-judge panel to issue an arrest warrant for President Omar Hassan al-Bashir to prevent the deaths of about 2.5 million people forced from their homes in the war-torn region of Darfur and who are still under attack from government-backed Janjaweed militia. The five charges against al-Bashir include masterminding attempts to wipe out African tribes in the war-torn region with a campaign of murder, rape and deportation. In an exclusive interview with CNN's Nic Robertson in the Dutch city of The Hague, the prosecutor said: ""After three years I have strong evidence that al-Bashir is committing a genocide. I cannot be blackmailed, I cannot yield. Silence never helped the victims. Silence helped the perpetrators. The prosecutor should not be silent."" Read a transcript of the interview . The judges must now decide whether to issue the warrant, although they have approved all 11 of Moreno-Ocampo's previous submissions to the court. The indictment against al-Bashir marks the first time prosecutors at the world's only permanent war crimes tribunal have issued charges against a sitting head of state.  Watch as ICC prosecutor targets al-Bashir » . At a news conference Monday in Khartoum, Sudanese Vice President Ali Osman Mohammed Taha rejected the authority of the ICC, saying Sudan was not a signatory to the court's creation. ""Hence there is no legal obligation or power over Sudan, whether Sudanese organizations or citizens,"" he said. Taha also called the charges an attempt to ""paralyze"" his country. And Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem Mohamad, Sudan's ambassador to the United Nations, said his government would respond through legal, political and ""other means."" ""The limit is the sky for our retaliation,"" he said. He said the country is not mobilizing its military, but has been organizing demonstrations in support of al-Bashir. The United Nations said Monday it is evacuating non-essential staff from Darfur ""due to the recent deteriorating security situation,"" but the joint African Union-U.N. peacekeeping mission in Darfur (UNAMID) vowed to maintain its operations. In his request, Moreno-Ocampo says there are reasonable grounds to believe al-Bashir bears criminal responsibility for five counts of genocide, two counts of crimes against humanity, and two counts of war crimes. The alleged crimes stem from a brutal counter-insurgency campaign the Sudanese government conducted after rebels began an uprising in Sudan's western Darfur region in 2003. The United States and much of the world has already characterized the campaign as genocide. The authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents there, according to the United Nations, western governments and human rights organizations. The militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels draw strength. About 300,000 people have died in Darfur, the United Nations estimates, and 2.5 million have been forced from their homes.  Watch a tour of Darfur's deserted Northern Corridor » . But Mohamad said the prosecutor's move could hurt the United Nations, which will still have to deal with Sudan's government on issues related to Darfur and in the peace process in the country's south, where a long-running civil war ended in 2005. ""It will put the chief negotiator in a very awkward situation. How is he going to deal with an indicted president,"" the ambassador said. ""How is the secretary-general going to do business regarding UNAMID with an indicted president?"" Moreno-Ocampo says al-Bashir targeted three ethnic groups living in the region -- including the Fur group, for whom Darfur is named -- solely on account of their ethnicity. Al-Bashir bears responsibility, Moreno-Ocampo says, because he sat at the apex of the government. ""For such crimes to be committed over a period of five years and throughout Darfur, al-Bashir had to mobilize and keep mobilized the whole state apparatus; he had to control and direct perpetrators; and he had to rely on a genocidal plan,"" Moreno-Ocampo wrote as background for arrest warrant request. In Khartoum, a crowd of about 2,000 people greeted al-Bashir, who seized power in a 1989 coup, when he arrived for an emergency meeting of his Cabinet Sunday to discuss the charges. When he saw the crowd, al-Bashir climbed onto a pickup truck and pumped his fist in the air, whipping the group into a frenzy. Some held signs saying, ""You are joking... Ocamp-who?"" and ""Death to America."" A high-ranking ambassador at the presidential palace called the possible prosecution stupid and malicious, and warned that the Sudanese people would see it as proof of a larger conspiracy against the country.  Watch why Sudan's leader has support in China » . In 2005, the Security Council cleared the way for possible war crimes prosecutions related to Darfur by the ICC, a permanent tribunal set up to handle prosecutions related to genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The court is based on a treaty signed by 106 nations -- excluding Sudan. The attacks in Darfur over the past five years have followed a common pattern, according to Moreno-Ocampo. Members of Sudan's armed forces, often acting together with the militias and under al-Bashir's command, singled out villages and towns inhabited by tribal groups. Troops and militia members shot and killed civilians, and sometimes the Sudanese air force was called in to bomb villages and towns in support of the ground forces, the prosecutor's evidence says. Residents who fled were often chased and attacked or left to fend for themselves in the wilderness, the evidence says. The attacks, it says, undermined the ability of the targeted groups to survive in Darfur. The destruction of their homes scattered entire communities, and the pervasive rape and sexual violence against girls and women -- who are often targeted when they are out collecting firewood or water -- has torn families apart.  Watch how UNICEF is trying to prevent rape in Darfur » . ""They are raping women, raping girls, raping in groups -- raping to destroy the communities,"" Moreno-Ocampo told CNN. ""Rape is a tool in the genocide -- the most important tool today."" The ICC has already indicted two men for Darfur crimes -- Ahmad Harun, Sudan's former minister of the interior who is now in charge of humanitarian affairs for the Sudanese government and militia leader Ali Kushayb -- but neither has been brought to justice. Once the ICC indicts someone, authorities in that person's native country -- or the country in which the indicted person is located -- have the power to detain the indicted person for trial at the Hague. Kushayb and Harun both remain in Sudan where they enjoy the protection of al-Bashir, Moreno-Ocampo said. Since they have not been arrested, the prosecutor says, it is unlikely al-Bashir will be -- and he says it will probably take a U.N. Security Council resolution for al-Bashir to be brought to justice. Senior Sudanese government leaders have previously told CNN that reports of atrocities in Darfur are exaggerated. ""Yes, there has been a war and some people have died, but it's not like what has been reflected in the media,"" Interior Minister Ibrahim Mahmoud Hamid said last month. CNN's Nic Robertson contributed to this report.","Sudanese president charged with genocide for campaign of violence in Darfur .

"(CNN) -- A shopper in Northern Ireland may have gotten more than she bargained for when she reportedly discovered a chilling note stuffed in a pair of pants she purchased from European retailer, Primark. Scrawled on a yellow piece of paper and wrapped around what appears to be a prison identification card, was a message claiming to be from an inmate at a Chinese prison making clothes for export under conditions of slave labor. ""We work 15 hours every day and eat food that wouldn't even be fed to pigs and dogs. We're (forced to) work like oxen,"" the handwritten note said in Chinese. The message appealed to the international community to ""condemn these human rights abuses by the Chinese government."" Tip of the iceberg? Karen Wisinska, who lives in Northern Ireland's Fermanagh county, said she bought the pants for about Â£10 ($16) on a trip to Belfast in 2011, but left the garment in her closet -- unworn -- after she discovered the zipper was broken. She only found the note when she retrieved the item while packing for a holiday last week, she said. After getting a rough translation of the note, Wisinka sought help from Amnesty International, an organization that has documented the use of forced labor in Chinese detention facilities in the past. ""I was shocked to find this note and card inside the trousers from Primark and even more shocked to discover that it appears to have been made under slave labor conditions in a Chinese prison,"" she told Amnesty. ""I am only sorry that I did not discover the note when I first purchased the clothing -- then I could have brought this scandal to light much earlier."" Amnesty International's Northern Ireland program director, Patrick Corrigan, described the story as ""horrific."" ""It's very difficult to know whether it's genuine, but the fear has to be that this is just the tip of the iceberg,"" Corrigan said. Investigation underway . Primark denied sourcing clothing made using forced labor in a statement Wednesday, noting the ""considerable time delay"" since the garment was purchased. A spokesperson for the company said that particular line of pants was last sold in Northern Ireland in October 2009. ""We find it very strange that this ... has come to light so recently, given that the trousers were on sale four years ago,"" he said. Since 2009, the company's ethical standards team has carried out nine inspections of the supplier who made the garment, and found no prison or forced labor of any kind, the statement said. Despite the company's suspicions, the spokesperson said Primark ""knows its responsibilities to the workers in its supply chain,"" and has started a detailed investigation. The company is also examining two other cases that have surfaced in Wales in recent days. On two separate occasions, women reportedly found desperate pleas sewn into labels on dresses purchased from the same Primark store in Swansea. One read ""Forced to work exhausting hours,"" while the other said, ""Degrading sweatshop conditions."" Primark said the circumstances surrounding the incidents were suspicious, since the labels looked very similar and the two garments were on sale around the same time, but they were made in two different countries, ""many thousands of miles apart."" The budget retailer was among a group of international brands that sourced from factories in Bangladesh's Rana Plaza building, which collapsed in April 2013, killing more than 1,000 workers and injuring 2,500 others. The company said it has paid over $12 million in aid and compensation to to support the victims of the disaster. Forced labor in China . It's not the first time western consumers have found distressing notes allegedly from abused workers in detention in China. In 2011, a woman in the United States found a letter in a mix of broken English and Chinese inside a Halloween decoration purportedly from a inmate who made the object under abusive conditions. Last year, CNN tracked down a Chinese man who claimed he wrote the note, along with more than a dozen others, while at a labor camp in northeastern China. Sears, the company that owned the store that sold the item, said it found ""no evidence"" that production was subcontracted to a labor camp during its investigation into the case, but added it no longer sourced from that supplier. Until recently, China used hundreds of labor camps to detain petty offenders without a trial, under what was known as the laojiao -- or ""re-education through labor"" -- scheme. The system was criticized by human rights groups as a means to silence so-called trouble makers, including political dissidents, activists and Falun Gong members. In November last year, Beijing said it would begin to close the camps. But Amnesty International has since warned that while the laojiao camps have been shut, research suggests that authorities have expanded the use of other forms of arbitrary detention such as ""black jails,"" enforced drug rehabilitation clinics and ""brainwashing centers"" to take their place. CNN could not reach the Xiang Nan prison in China's Hubei province, where the note found in Northern Ireland allegedly came from. The facility houses around 5,000 inmates, according to China's justice ministry. CNN's Dayu Zhang and Steven Jiang contributed to this report.","Woman in Northern Ireland finds note in garment, allegedly from Chinese prisoner .

"Clearwater, Florida (CNN) -- Casey Anthony broke into tears Monday as a judge read potential jurors the indictment accusing the Florida mother of killing her 2-year-old daughter and then lying to law enforcement authorities. The emotional display came during the first day of jury selection in the trial of the 25-year-old Anthony, who is charged with capital murder in the death of her daugher, Caylee. She also faces six other charges, including aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter of a child and misleading law enforcement. Monday's proceedings occurred in a Clearwater, Florida, courthouse, about 100 miles southwest of Orlando where Caylee's grandmother first reported her missing in 2008 -- weeks after the girl was last seen, and five months before her body was found. Authorities moved the proceedings there hoping to draw from a jury pool that was less likely to have seen and been influenced by the intense media coverage surrounding the case. They kept the site in Pinellas County location secret until Monday morning, hoping to minimize the media rush in the area from which citizens will decide Anthony's fate. Once jury selection is complete, the jurors will be transported back to Orlando's Orange County for the trial, which is now scheduled to start May 17. The major question posed Monday by Orange County Superior Court Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. to the 66 jurors who came before him was whether they'd be able to remain sequestered in Orlando for up to eight weeks for the trial. More citizens will be called into court Tuesday and perhaps beyond. ""Our system of justice depends on people like you willing to serve,"" the judge said. ""You are being asked to perform one of the highest duties of citizenship."" Of those called Monday, 45 were excused. The 21 who were not -- 14 men and 7 women -- will be called back Wednesday. Perry allowed the dozens of men and women to go home for various reasons. Many cited financial hardship -- saying they or their family would suffer if they couldn't work for two months. Others said they had to take care of loved ones. One man said he was active-duty military, about to ship out to Alaska for his U.S. Coast Guard responsibility. Monday was the first phase in the jury selection process. The other phases include asking jurors, one by one, for their take on the death penalty, which Casey Anthony would be eligible for if convicted on the murder charge. Lastly, the jurors will be quizzed on their knowledge of the case and other positions -- including if they have an opinion, prior to the trial, on Anthony's guilt or innocence. Throughout the selection process, Perry can weigh arguments from members of Anthony's legal team and state prosecutors and decide to exclude certain men and women from the jury pool. Besides winnowing down the jury pool, Perry also issued several decisions Monday that were all setbacks for the defense. That included denying Anthony's lawyers motion for more time to prepare for the trial, as well as questioning whether there was enough racial and ethnic diversity in the potential jury pool gathered in Clearwater. Perhaps the most significant ruling came when, in a written order, Perry determined the jury can consider evidence about an alleged ""decompositional"" odor coming from Casey Anthony's trunk, and hear from certain expert witnesses. The defense had knocked the analysis as unreliable and too closely tied to the FBI, suggesting it could be prejudiced against their client. The judge conceded the Anthony trial could be the first time the ""chemical signature of the odor of human decomposition or the identity of the volatile chemical components of human decomposition"" might be considered during a trial in Florida. Still, he wrote, ""The expert's testimony will assist the jury in understanding the evidence and in determining facts in the case."" In Session's Michael Christian contributed to this report.","NEW: Of the 66 potential jurors called Monday, 45 are excused .

"(CNN) -- This fall, for the first time in U.S. history, an openly atheist candidate is running for Congress. James Woods is fighting an uphill battle as a Democrat seeking to represent the very Republican 5th Congressional District in Arizona. There are now no openly atheist members of Congress, even though nearly 20% of Americans report having no religious affiliation, according to the Pew Research Center, and between 5% and 10% of Americans do not believe in a supreme being. So far, only one sitting congressman, Pete Stark of California, has ever admitted to being an atheist while in office. First elected in 1972, Stark came out of the atheist closet back in 2007, but he lost his re-election bid in 2012 after serving in the U.S. House for 40 years. Photos: Famous atheists and their beliefs . Apparently, it is easier to be a gay member of Congress than an atheist one, since Barney Frank announced he was gay in 1987 but didn't announce he was an atheist until after leaving office in 2013. A handful of current members of Congress state that their religious affiliation is ""unspecified,"" but none has stated publicly that he or she doesn't believe in God. Their reticence is pure political pragmatism. The reluctance of Americans to vote for atheists is well documented. In fact, a hypothetical ""well-qualified"" atheist presidential candidate polls at 54%, lower than any other category -- below Muslims, gays/lesbians, Mormons, Jews, Hispanics, Catholics, women, or African-Americans. This fundamental distrust is puzzling. When people of faith question the morality of those without faith, how do they reconcile that with the countless crimes committed in the name of religion throughout history (e.g. The Spanish Inquisition) and in modern times (e.g. ISIS)? Not only are atheists unlikely to win elections, but they are actually banned from holding office under the constitutions of seven states (Arkansas, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas), according to the American Humanist Association, even though this clearly violates Article VI of the U.S. Constitution, which states that ""no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States."" When the views of anywhere from 5% to 20% of the American people are not part of the debate in our legislatures, the laws that are passed may not fully reflect the will of the people or, at a minimum, take into account the opinion of a sizable minority. African-Americans are about 13% of the U.S. population and have a representation of about 10% of the members of the U.S. House. Imagine how people would react today if there were no African-Americans in Congress. That admitted atheists are virtually unelectable is a mark of prejudice against them and it impacts the ways we formally educate the future leaders of this country. Consider the fact that Tennessee recently passed a law allowing teachers to tell their students that evolution and climate change are ""scientifically controversial,"" and that Ohio is considering passing  a law that would enable the teaching of intelligent design alongside evolution. Why is it that we require our candidates to profess a religious faith, but not that they demonstrate even minimal scientific literacy? Our representatives in Congress make critical decisions on science policy and science funding, and yet are often hostile to the entire scientific enterprise. In 2012, Rep. Paul Broun, R-Georgia, while serving on the House science committee, famously said that evolution and the Big Bang are ""lies from the pit of hell."" As one prejudice after another has fallen by the wayside and we have elected women, African-Americans, gays and lesbians, and Jewish people to represent us, we have seen that the world has not come to an end. Life continues, and our debate is enriched by the diversity of opinions. It is time to end the prejudice that keeps qualified people without faith from considering a run for public office and keeps atheist officials from being honest about their beliefs.

"New York (CNN) -- ""Expect us"" is the favorite tag line for an endless stream of Web videos posted by the Internet collective known as Anonymous. It's a promise and a threat. In 2011, galvanized by the national Occupy movement, Anonymous delivered. ""This is what happens when the people have had enough,"" said ""Troy,"" a member of the collective who joined the street protests in New York. ""This is what happens when greed goes unchecked. It's the closest thing to a global revolution we've ever gotten."" From the inception of Occupy Wall Street, Anonymous has had a powerful impact on the movement, promoting it tirelessly through social media in the early days; driving it forward with Internet campaigns, known as ""ops,"" targeting bankers and politicians; and ultimately acting as a savage and effective counterforce to what the group sees as a militarized police state. ""Hopefully, he'll think twice before he pulls out his baton against somebody who's holding a sign saying we just want peace,"" said Troy, who spent weeks monitoring and videotaping New York Police Department officers during the height of the Occupy Wall Street protests. The list of police officers and agencies targeted by Anonymous is long. From New York to Oakland, California, cops had their Web sites hacked; personal information, including the home addresses of specific police officers, was posted online; and officers who used pepper spray on Occupy protesters, including NYPD Deputy Inspector Anthony Bologna and Lt. John Pike at the University of California-Davis, saw their entire life histories blasted out in Web videos and document dumps. ""I think [police] see it as a form of vigilantism,"" said professor Gabriella Coleman, an anthropologist who studies Anonymous at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec. The collective, Coleman said, ""is pushing the boundaries of the law, but I think some of their actions also reveal the ways that private security companies or police are also acting outside of the boundaries of the law."" The online intimidation is intended both to punish errant police and serve as a warning to riot cops facing difficult decisions in the heat of often chaotic protests. Police are reluctant to speak publicly about the collective's activities because Anonymous is so quick to target critics. But privately, they're furious, especially when Anonymous posts the names of family members. Occasionally, the battle between police and Anonymous erupts on Twitter. Last year, a Los Angeles homicide detective who goes by the name @LAMurderCop had his personal information dumped online, and he retaliated with a series of sarcastic tweets. ""Let it be known to all,"" he wrote, ""your mainly teenagers in your moms house. U have no skills."" Anonymous is also the subject of several federal and state investigations, including one by the commonwealth of Massachusetts, which issued subpoenas to Twitter in an investigation of threats directed against Boston police after the department's website was hacked. Like police, members of Anonymous are also reluctant to speak publicly, both for their own security and because it runs counter to their deeply held belief that the positions held by the collective, expressed through the rolling democracy of the Internet, are far more important than the opinions of any individual anon, or person who participates in Anonymous activities. ""Troy"" agreed to talk to CNN on camera provided we not reveal his real identity. ""There's no specific group or one person that talks for us,"" he says. ""It's more like a hive; an idea is brought up and ... if the overwhelming majority of people agree with it, then we go with it."" Monitoring and exposing what they see as police misconduct is one of the ideas that caught fire. In one Internet relay chat session, members of the collective who go by the online handle AnonymousIRC said police need to understand that the Internet is unpredictable and uncontrollable. ""We cannot control or limit what some individual anon may or may not do, neither is it in our interest,"" they said. ""If some cop finds it funny to mace innocent girls, Internet crowd will hate him. Which will include his family. Like it or not, it's just what happens."" This year is expected to bring more protests centered on high-profile gatherings, such as the NATO and G8 summits in Chicago in May and the political conventions in late summer. In the past, those kinds of events have been marked by sometimes violent clashes between protesters and police. This time, Anonymous will be watching.","Member of hacker collective says people have been abused for too long .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A former porn actress who says she had a three-year intimate relationship with Tiger Woods posted text messages online Thursday that she says the golfer sent her last year. ""I just wanted to let the public know what the relationship was and that he has not taken responsibility for his behavior,"" said Veronica Siwik-Daniels, who goes by the screen name Joslyn James. ""Everyone else can draw their own conclusions from that,"" she said. The Web site displayed 120 text messages purported to have been sent to her by Woods between July and October of last year. The messages document ""just a brief part of the time we had together,"" Siwik-Daniels said. Woods publicly apologized for his extramarital affairs last month, but he has never disclosed the names of any of his lovers. The golfer's management company did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment on the text messages. Many of the texts provide information on hotel room numbers and times for meetings, including instructions to be discreet. A number of messages are explicitly sexual. The final series of texts suggest that the person communicating with Siwik-Daniels was upset with her because she was almost seen by the sender's agent during an encounter in early October. Siwik-Daniels told CNN she considered the messages to be ""typical of those between someone you are in a relationship with."" She said she gave up her career in pornographic films because Woods was jealous of the idea of her with another man. Her Web site said she ""is now receiving many requests for personal appearances, television shows, film opportunities as well as product endorsements."" But she is not ready to announce her next career move, she said. ""Stayed tuned to find out,"" she said. At a news conference last month, which immediately followed Woods' televised apology, she called on the golfer to publicly acknowledge their relationship. ""I would be open to a telephoned apology from Tiger, but I really feel that I deserve to look at him in person, face-to-face, in his eyes, because I did not deserve this,"" Siwik-Daniels said. She told CNN Thursday that she has still not heard from him, not even a text message.","NEW: Woods' management company has no immediate comment on the texts .

"London (CNN) -- Russia's beef with the west has escalated after the country banned fruit, vegetables, dairy and meat products from a host of Western nations including the U.S., Australia, Canada and those of the European Union. And by hitting agriculture in particular, Russia has deliberately gone for a sector key to the EU's founding treaties -- one which evokes all sorts of emotive and divisive rhetoric. As we have seen from the decades-long, fraught battles over reforming the bloc's most expensive scheme -- one which gobbles up some 40% of its budget -- food production has the capacity to get Europe's citizens pretty upset. Spearheaded by France in the days of post-war shortages, the Common Agricultural Policy saw the then European Community granted the power to subsidize exports to give non-EU countries. That gave Russia, for instance, a taste for European produce. It's a strategy that worked. Which foods are off Russian menus? Two decades after the Iron curtain shut out the EU's goods completely, Russia is now the bloc's second largest consumer of foodstuffs after the U.S., taking $15.8 billion of foodstuffs annually. Western brands have invested heavily in Russia and relied on the country as a key growth story they can sell to investors. And while EU officials crunch the numbers to assess the impact of Europe's food sector, you can imagine CEOs of the region's biggest listed companies will be scrambling to find an alternative source to make up for those lost sales. But Europe's agriculture policies could also cost its members dear if the Russia ban stays in force for its full one-year duration or even beyond that time frame. Why? Because if the sanctions cause a glut of food, the EU may be forced to buy up extra stocks to keep its farmers in business. Yet in hitting the EU's agriculture sector, Russia is serving up just one dish on a menu that could include other damaging measures across an array of industries. They would be measures designed to hit different EU countries in different ways -- pitting their individual economic interests against their supposed common goals. Though Russia hasn't used its ultimate weapon, energy, in the fight yet. Curtailing Russia's gas flow to Europe would jeopardize Germany's manufacturing powerhouse and sanctions on cars and parts would hurt its sizeable automotive sector, which is already heavily geared towards Moscow for exports. But it's not just Russia's retaliatory sanctions that have the propensity to cause discord among EU members. Western sanctions on Russia's finance sector threaten London's City which has already put up a robust defense against interference from Brussels. Further talk of canceling France's multi-billion dollar warship contracts for Russia has left President Hollande indignant. Tit-for-tat actions, such as the ones we have witnessed between Russia and the West, often have a way of balancing themselves out. Russia is already making a show of seeking new food suppliers like Brazil to make up the shortfall. But setting up new trade relations will require time and effort before those items make it to supermarket shelves. In the meantime, though it'll be hard cheese for EU's agriculture sector and Russia's consumers too. READ MORE: Explore CNN's infographic on the foods that are banned from Russia .

"(CNN) -- In a few days, people in the Midwest and Northern Plains will have reason to be jealous of what their countrymen in the Northeast are going through now -- digging out from as much as 2 feet of snow, dealing with the effect of blizzard-level winds, and feeling the heat of below-zero temperatures. Because as cold as it is now, it's practically tropical compared to what's coming. Think lows in the -20s Fahrenheit across North Dakota and Minnesota, with wind chills of -50 or even more frigid, according to the National Weather Service. Sunday night in Chicago will be a brisk minus 16 to 20, or 35 below to 45 below zero if you factor in the Windy City's wind. Those at Lambeau Field for the Green Bay Packers vs. San Francisco 49ers NFL game may cheer against overtime, given that the wind chill may dip to 50 below in Wisconsin that night. As the weather service's Twin Cities, Minnesota, division warns, ""Exposed flesh can freeze in as little as five minutes with wind chills colder than 50 below."" The same agency tweeted that this system will produce ""the coldest air in two decades."" In fact, between Friday and Wednesday, nearly 140 million Americans -- nearly half the nation -- will experience temperatures of 0 degrees Fahrenheit or below, according to a CNN calculation. As Packers head coach Mike McCarthy said Friday: ""This is not the norm."" 'The snow was absolutely insane' It's not like those who braved the latest storm have it easy. Just ask Ford Fischer. The CNN iReporter spent part of Friday trying to clear the driveway around his home in Boxford, Massachusetts, where the weather service said more snow -- 23.8 inches -- fell than in any other community hit by the Thursday-into-Friday nor'easter. Every time he finished a spot, he'd turn around and see it covered with snow again. ""The snow was absolutely insane,"" Fischer said, ""and totally nonstop."" Even after the snow was done, he and others affected by this storm system were in for a tough few hours, thanks to the cold. Temperatures in parts of New York City, where as much as 8 inches of snow fell, were predicted to drop to zero Friday night for the first time since January 1994. It was also set to dip below zero, with minus 17 wind chill, in Boston after nearly 18 inches of snow. Fears of widespread power outages didn't come to bear, despite blizzard-level winds in some places. By 5 p.m. Wednesday, major utilities in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New England were reporting just over 1,100 outages, a far cry from a major nor'easter last February that knocked out electricity to more than 630,000 customers. As happens with such weather, there was tragedy as well. Three people died in car accidents in Pennsylvania -- including one man crushed as he was moving street salt with a forklift. Emergency management agency spokesman Cory Angell said these deaths were weather-related. In Byron, New York, a 71-year-old woman wandered away from her home Thursday night and was later found dead in the snow in a wooded area about 100 yards away, the Genesee County Sheriff's Office reported. In Oakland, New Jersey, a calamity was averted when authorities rescued a 34-year-old man who fell through ice in Ringwood State Park as he tried to retrieve one of his snowshoes, said environmental protection department spokesman Larry Ragonese. Air traffic delays abound . Then there were the thousands stuck at airports nationwide because of system-wide delays -- though at least they were suffering inside, not in the frigid cold. FlightAware.com, which tracks cancellations due to weather and mechanical problems, said about 3,000 flights were canceled for Friday within, into or out of the United States. That's after more than 2,600 U.S. flights were canceled on Thursday. Though the temperature in Las Vegas was 52 degrees -- above zero -- passengers there were also feeling the storm's sting. Long lines formed inside McCarran International Airport at the counters for Southwest Airlines, which had canceled many of its flights from Chicago. The airline carries 40% of the airport's passengers, according to Chris Hayes, an airport spokesman. ""We are doing everything possible to get back up and running as soon as possible,"" Southwest Airlines spokesman Dan Landson said on Friday afternoon. Flights resumed by late Friday morning in much of New England, though delays were common, and ticket holders were urged to check with their airlines. Barb Plooster had planned to fly Friday from Erie, Pennsylvania, to Grand Rapids, Michigan, but her flight was canceled. She told CNN affiliate WICU that she was on the phone with United Airlines for five hours trying to find a way to get home, but concluded she will have to wait until Monday. ""We got a warm place to stay, get to visit the kids, the grandkids, so it's OK,"" she said. Historically cold arctic air mass . This being winter, after all, there's more snow coming -- and perhaps more delays, more accidents, and more headaches. One storm threatened to bring blizzard conditions to North Dakota as well as parts of South Dakota and Minnesota on Friday night and Saturday, the weather service said. And cities like St. Louis, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Indianapolis and Cincinnati -- the latter of which will play host to a Bengals vs. San Diego Chargers NFL football game -- could get hit with significant snow Sunday and Monday. Some areas will get some reprieve as temperatures rise in the coming days. But they better not get too comfortable, as the temperatures will reverse course starting Sunday. Parts of the Midwest could see temperatures not recorded in 15 to 20 years, and for a painful stretch. Chicago, for instance, could see subzero temperatures from Sunday evening until Wednesday. Even areas as far south as Nashville, Tennessee, could be basking in zero-degree cold as the arctic air mass dives southward at the beginning of next week. That's not just an inconvenience: That cold is dangerous. And it's why school will be canceled in places like Milwaukee and the entire state of Minnesota -- areas hardly unaccustomed to Old Man Winter's bite -- on Monday. ""I have made this decision to protect all our children from the dangerously cold temperatures,"" Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said in explaining his decision to call off classes statewide. CNN's Rande Iaboni, Brandon Miller, Dave Hennen, Sherri Pugh, Lateef Mungin, Jareen Imam, Kristin Hamill, Chuck Johnston, Ashley Fantz and AnneClaire Stapleton contributed to this report.","NEW: Some 3,000 flights canceled Friday after more than 2,600 cancellations Thursday .

"Washington (CNN) -- We're approaching the 100th anniversary of the birthday of Ronald Reagan: February 6, 2011. It's time to begin thinking seriously about an appropriate national commemoration of this good man and great president. To date, the main attempts to honor Reagan in the nation's capital have gone askew. A government office building second in size only to the Pentagon? An airport from which Washingtonians cannot fly to California? These do not seem very appropriate monuments to a president who fought bureaucracy and yearned for home. The other ideas that sometimes circulate in Congress seem equally misplaced: Placing Reagan on the currency or building a giant statue somewhere in Washington. More than most presidents, Reagan would have wanted to be remembered for his ideas, not his image. The right commemoration would honor those. Let me suggest something: A museum in Washington dedicated to the victims of communism. The struggle against communism impelled American foreign policy for almost half a century. That struggle was also the central concern of Ronald Reagan's political life. As much as Reagan cared about the geopolitics of the struggle, he cared even more about the human victims of communism's brutal totalitarian ideology. The countries of Eastern Europe are now memorializing their terrible experiences under communism. A particularly impressive museum has opened in Budapest, Hungary. But Eastern Europe did not suffer alone. Cambodia, China, Cuba, Ethiopia and  Afghanistan also have their stories to tell. A ""Ronald Reagan Museum of the Victims of Communism"" in Washington would ensure that these stories were kept alive and made vivid for future generations. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington offers an outstanding example to emulate. The Holocaust Museum has emerged as one of Washington's most-visited sites. It offers a message that is purposeful as well as mournful. It's a message propounded from the National Archives to the Lincoln Memorial -- and a message to which Ronald Reagan devoted his political life: . The principles on which the United States is built are not mere preferences. Reject those principles, and you are embarking on a nightmare that can culminate in the ultimate horrors of human injustice, oppression, cruelty and violence. As yet, the crimes of communism are appallingly minimized, excused or even condoned in the places where they were ordered, places such as Moscow, Havana, Beijing and Hanoi. Earlier this year, I had the chance to visit the one and only public remembrance of the Cultural Revolution in all China, a small museum in a park on the outskirts of a provincial city. What could be more fitting than to remember those crimes in the city that we called the capital of the free world during the struggle against communism? And in the name of the president who not only spoke so eloquently against those crimes, but who issued the challenge that presaged communism's downfall? So there's my proposal for the new Congress. Introduce a bill to authorize the development of the museum on February 6, with a view to completing work in time for Reagan's 110th birthday in 2021. Instead of a statue, remember this president who so valued the individual with a monument that will restore the individuality of wronged, imprisoned and murdered millions. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","The 100th anniversary of Ronald Reagan's birth is February 6, 2011 .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani Taliban vowed on Thursday to kill Shakeel Afridi, the jailed Pakistani doctor accused of helping the CIA in the search for Osama bin Laden, a spokesman for the militant group told CNN. ""We will cut him into pieces when we find him,"" Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan told CNN by phone. ""He spied for the U.S. to hunt down our hero Osama bin Laden."" Pakistani officials say Afridi is being held in a prison in the city of Peshawar in northwest Pakistan. Last week a court in Pakistan's tribal region sentenced Afridi to 33 years in prison but a copy of the court order obtained by CNN shows Afridi was sentenced for alleged connections to the militant group Lashkar-e-Islam, not for helping Americans in the search for bin Laden. Even so, the Pakistani Taliban says Afridi is the number-one target on its hit list. On Wednesday the jailed doctor's brother told CNN he fears for Afridi's safety and called on the United States to help set him free. ""These allegations are false. They're baseless,"" said Jamil Afridi. ""My brother didn't do anything against Pakistan. If he helped the U.S., it was for the benefit of Pakistan. The American government should help us in any way it can."" Officials had told CNN Shekeel Afridi was charged with treason for spying for the United States. He was accused of helping the CIA locate bin Laden in his compound in Abbottabad through a fake vaccination campaign. Bin Laden was killed in the subsequent U.S. raid on the compound in May last year. At least one legal analyst said Afridi's sentence is a sham. Islamabad-based lawyer Shahzad Akbar questioned the legitimacy of the court proceedings, since the punishment was handed down by a tribal court in Khyber even though the alleged offense occurred in Abbottabad. The Afridi verdict sparked anger in the United States and further strained relations between Washington and Islamabad. The tensions surfaced as Congress debated aid to Pakistan in several bills. In the National Defense Authorization Act, senators agreed last week to withhold Pakistan's part of a $1.75 billion aid package because of outrage over Afridi's case and the continued blockade of NATO supply routes into and out of Afghanistan. Another bill in the Senate Appropriations Committee withheld $33 million in aid to Pakistan for similar reasons. Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik has said cutting aid is a U.S. prerogative, but added: ""I think the U.S. should not forget we are a victim in this war on terror and we're suffering for the international community, too."" Journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","The Taliban says the doctor is No. 1 on its hit list .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- They are some of the biggest names in Hollywood, but even Susan Sarandon, Ethan Hawke and Dustin Hoffman have had their fair share of casting calamities they would rather forget. Mike Myers sabotaged some auditions for parts he didn't want. ""Why not be nude even if it is a children's theatre?"" CNN's The Screening Room has managed to persuade the cream of Hollywood to confess their tales of audition woe. The stars shudder at the memory of waiting in line, frantically trying to memorize lines handed to them moments before, all the while being assessed by critical strangers. Benicio del Toro recounts attending 50 or 60 auditions before getting a part and Quentin Tarantino told Eli Roth he ""blew it"" when he first auditioned for ""Inglourious Basterds."" While Catherine Keener remembers a cutting personal assessment: ""You're not pretty enough."" Here are some of their worst moments: . Bill Nighy ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest."" ""Love Actually"" ""There was one that started out terrible, which was where I had to go to a disused tax office in Harrow [near London, England] very early in the morning and put on very tight velvet flared loon pants and a pair of crocodile four-inch- heeled platform shoes, and wear a sort of very small top that didn't meet my trousers, hair extensions and I had to karaoke to 'Smoke on the Water' by Deep Purple. It's a very lonely place. And I was 45 at the time..."" Ethan Hawke ""Before Sunset,"" ""Before the Devil Knows You're Dead"" ""I have had so many bad auditions. I have fallen on my ass. I have made a complete fool of myself. I auditioned for Robert Redford once and I was so starstruck I couldn't even speak. I had a mic wire at a screen test clipped to me and then I got kind of nervous and I paced in a circle and then took a step and tripped and fell on my face. You just have to forgive yourself and keep going on."" Mike Myers ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,"" ""Shrek"" ""I've had some bad auditions for some TV movies that were shooting in England where I just didn't want to be in them and offered them more obtuse [performances] ... I like to think of it as performance art. I didn't sabotage it, I was just woefully inappropriate, you know? I just thought, 'Why not be nude even if it is a children's theatre?"" Catherine Keener ""Being John Malkovich,"" ""Synecdoche, New York"" ""You wouldn't believe some of the comments, assessments. But, they're really not meant personally. Like for example, 'You're not pretty enough.' For them it's just a fact. But for you it's like, 'Oh my God! I have to live with this.' You get a thicker skin about it, which you should because it isn't meant personally, but it's such a personal profession that you kind of have to get used to getting critiqued on things that you shouldn't even care about."" Dustin Hoffman ""Marathon Man,"" ""Meet the Fockers"" ""The most famous casting director from New York, I was lucky enough to get an audition with her in the '60s. She did all the plays, all the Broadway plays. She is sitting across the desk saying her lines, and I am saying mine, and she stops and says, 'Come here. Bring your chair here, right next to me.' And I say, 'Why?' And she says, 'Because I can't hear you, and you have never been on the stage or on Broadway, and you are going to have to reach the last row.' I said, 'Yeah, I know. I have been studying acting for about seven years now, but I'm not on Broadway now, I'm just sitting in front of you.' So, she said, 'I know, but I couldn't hear you. That's why I asked you to sit next to me.' I said, 'Okay. Can you hear me now?' I was getting so angry. Well, at that point she said, 'Speak up,' and I screamed as loud as I could, every line after. She called my agent and said, 'If you ever send that maniac around here again I will never see another one of your clients.' I really lost it.

Demi Moore ""A Few Good Men,"" ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" ""I auditioned for 'A Few Good Men' with Tom Cruise and Rob Reiner and when I went into that audition I was eight months pregnant ,so there is always kind of a lasting impression that I was playing this military officer with this gigantic belly.

"(CNN) -- His song is one of the enduring anthems of the turbulent 1960s, a soulful call to action awash in a psychedelic wave of sound. It has appeared in more than 100 movies and TV shows, even a multimillion-seller video game, and has been covered by artists from Sheryl Crow to Joan Jett to The Ramones. So, decades later, what does Lester Chambers have to show for ""Time Has Come Today""? So little that, early this year, the 72-year-old found himself posting a photo online. In it, he held a poster declaring that he was living on Social Security and charity, having gone nearly 30 years before seeing his first, paltry royalty check. The poster was taped to one of his gold records. ""It's been a long journey,"" said Chambers, who said he never blew his money on drugs or booze like so many artists before and after. ""I have not understood what happened yet and how it happened."" But now, through a series of events only possible in the digital age, he's getting a chance to start again -- this time making and selling music on his own terms. ""We've got a lawyer now,"" Chambers said. ""It's called the computer."" ""Time Has Come Today"" was a pop hit for The Chambers Brothers, spending five weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1968 and peaking at No. 11. The group, which shared the stage with the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and The Doors, would fail to match its success again . But it became emblematic of the political and social upheaval of the late '60s and would be used for decades to invoke the spirit of that era. As recently as last year, it was used in a pivotal scene in ""Homefront,"" a military-style video game that has sold somewhere around 3 million copies. Chambers said the entire group got about $4,000 for its use in that game. ""If they did that with one of the major groups, mainly one from England and you know who they are, they would have gotten $150-200,000 for that,"" he said. ""We never got taken care of at all."" It's a story of bad contracts -- and record company executives refusing to even honor those, he said. The contract for ""Time Has Come Today"" promised a small percentage of sales, but the record company kept finding expenses that came out of the band's share before they saw any of it. Other albums were produced but never released, he said, although the ""expenses"" for them kept racking up. To this day, he's not sure how some of those albums are available for sale online or who's getting the money for them. That all led Chambers, with the help of his son, Dylan, to post the Web photo as part of the ""I Am the 99 Percent"" movement. ""People were all riled up about the '1%' screwing over the little man,"" said Dylan Chambers, who has lived with his parents and helped support them through the lean years. ""Dad wrote that piece of paper and I taped it to his gold record. ""We woke up the next morning and it had 200 shares and 10,000 'likes' on Facebook. Dad had 500 new friend requests."" Chambers didn't identify himself in the photo. But it had picked up steam on social-news site Reddit and it didn't take long for members of the site's popular music community to figure it out. That's where Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of Reddit, came in. He was fresh off of helping lead the Web's successful fight against the Stop Online Piracy Act, legislation supporters said would crack down on Internet piracy but that many in the Web community felt would stifle free speech and creativity. ""One of the few narratives the entertainment industry kept trying to push was that they were really pushing for this on behalf of the artists,"" Ohanian said. Chambers' story, he said, showed how that business really treats its own sometimes. Furthermore, he said, it was personal. ""I was raised right by my dad -- the Stones, Dylan, Janis, Hendrix ... . I had no idea, and my dad had no idea of the fate of Lester Chambers,"" said Ohanian, 29. View the Kickstarter project: ""Lester's Time Has Come Today"" He wasn't the first person to reach out to Lester and his family. But they say many of the offers they'd gotten sounded just as dodgy as ones from the days Lester said his band would play concerts for 1/10th of what other acts were getting. ""Sure, you'd get five or six snakes out of the grass saying ... I want to book you a gig or something,"" said Dylan Chambers. ""But I was familiar with Reddit and checked out who Alexis was. He said, 'I want to do this project with you guys, and I want this to blow up.' "" Ohanian helped Chambers host an AMA (""Ask Me Anything"") on Reddit and create a project on crowd-funding site Kickstarter to pay for his first new album in decades. With 16 days to go, ""Lester's Time Has Come Today"" had raised $37,000 of its $39,000 goal on Monday. If successful, that cash will pay for rehearsal, production and musicians. This time, Chambers will retain the rights to the songs he records. ""It's very, very different -- much cleaner,"" said Chambers, who has continued to perform live through the years. ""You don't have to sit and hear somebody (with a record company) tell you their little stories. ""There are so many of us who never got anything out of being a musician. I'm just so blessed to have this opportunity to come back into the music world and put my feelings and lyrics and music out."" He's already gone into the studio to record a pair of Christmas songs, which were sent digitally to Kickstarter backers. (To listen, click the audio links to the left of this story.) To Ohanian, it all shows the promise of what the Internet could, and should, be. ""It fills me with so much hope and optimism ... ,"" he said. ""That's why you saw millions of people fighting for this."" The man who sang that his ""soul's been psychedelicized"" puts it differently. ""You can get on the Internet with all your creative processes and thought processes and it will take you to higher places than you could ever dream,"" Chambers said. ""A whole lot of people are going to be able to come out of the dark and into the light and the mountains that were so high will be easy to climb.""","""Time Has Come Today"" singer getting second chance online .

"Warsaw, Poland (CNN) -- I stopped on a recent night in front of the palace of the Polish president. I had no choice: The crowd stood so thick that I could not move. We were hemmed between the buildings on one side of the sidewalk and a police barrier on the other. The wide pavement between was obstructed by gawkers watching a strange performance: a weird seemingly incomprehensible little passion play of stereotyped figures. What the hell is this? I asked an onlooker wedged against me. I kept asking. He answered, but in Polish, leaving me no wiser. I had stumbled across the summer's big political conflict in Poland: the site of a wooden cross placed to commemorate the accidental death of Lech Kaczynski, the former president of Poland killed in an air crash near Smolensk in April. Admirers of the president had laid the cross at the gates of the presidential residence as a symbol of mourning. In the same spirit, admirers of Princess Diana laid flowers at the gate of Kensington Palace in London. But while flowers disintegrate after an interval, wooden crosses do not. The cross stayed in place for weeks. Supporters lit candles, said prayers. You might expect the crowds to thin as time passed. Quite the opposite. Feelings for -- and against -- have flared and intensified the battle over a cross that has come to symbolize the divisions in Polish society. Kaczynski was not a universally admired figure. Younger Poles, urban Poles, highly educated Poles tended to perceive Kaczynski as rustic, embarrassing. Older Poles, rural Poles, tradition-minded Poles were Kaczynski's constituency. Like them, Kaczynski upheld traditional Catholic beliefs and mistrusted free-market economic reforms. Kaczynski's death confirmed both his supporters and his detractors' views. Supporters saw a Polish patriot flying to Smolensk to pay tribute to the 22,000 Polish officers murdered in the Katyn Forest in 1940 -- and to extract from Russia belated acknowledgement of its crime. Detractors saw an egomaniac trying to upstage his own prime minister, who had made the same trip for the same purpose three days earlier. They quietly suspect Kaczynski pressured his pilot to disregard air traffic control and proceed with a landing in unsafe conditions, resulting in the deaths of 95 others. Supporters have increasingly represented Kaczynski as a martyr, a victim of a mysterious conspiracy organized by the Russians, the New World Order, who knows who? Detractors are disgusted by the conspiracy theories -- and increasingly impatient with accolades to a president they quietly regard as deeply third-rate. At the beginning of August, Poland's newly elected president, Bronislaw Komorowski, proposed a compromise. The cross would be removed from the presidential residence and displayed instead in nearby St. Anne's Church, one of the capital's most famous monuments. At the original site of the cross, a commemorative plaque would be placed in the pavement. That proposal enraged pro-Kaczynski Poles. On August 3, more than 1,000 protesters forcibly prevented the removal of the cross. Cross opponents have now begun to stage counter-protests. The opponents have begun to perceive in the cross agitation an attempt to impose a sectarian identity on a state that -- while overwhelmingly Catholic in belief -- is secular in law. ""Crosses belong in church, not at the gate of the presidential palace,"" one cross opponent told me. They see the crowds surrounding the cross as the embryo of a reactionary, xenophobic political movement: a repudiation of 20 years of effort to build a modern, dynamic, European Poland. But pro-Kaczynski Poles see the dismissal of the cross as a dismissal of them. Not all Poles speak English or German, not all Poles use a computer or work for international companies. Many Poles were born slightly too early to benefit from post-communist opportunities: For them, the end of communism meant only the end of a job at a steel mill or a coal mine or a collective farm. They know that city sophisticates disparaged Kaczynski as crude and ignorant. They darkly suspect that these upwardly mobile Poles hold an equally negative opinion of their less successful compatriots. As one Kaczynski supporter told the Financial Times: The cross ""is a reminder that there was a president here who suffered, who was made fun of."" If you catch echoes here of what Sarah Palin has meant to some of her supporters, it's probably not a coincidence: a politician disdained by society's smarty-pants - and who redeployed that disdain to gain the support of those who feel disdained themselves. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","A wooden cross dedicated to late President Lech Kaczynski has prompted division in Poland .
David Frum says supporters of keeping cross in place favor more traditional values .
He says those in favor of moving cross support dramatic improvements in Polish economy .
Kaczynski's admirers think he was not valued by the elites, Frum says, much like Sarah Palin ."
"(CNN) -- The delayed stadium in the Brazilian city of Curitiba has retained its World Cup status after satisfying FIFA that all was being done to get the Arena da Baixada ready for June's finals. Last month, world football's governing body gave local organizers a deadline of 18 February by which to have made significant improvements or risk losing its four World Cup games. One of these matches includes the final group game for world champions Spain against Australia on June 23. ""The special committee instigated by Brazil's Ministry of Sports following an emergency meeting on January 21, consisting of representatives of Atletico Paranaense, the state of Parana and the city of Curitiba, has managed ... to develop a comprehensive recovery plan which includes the solving of the financial challenges involved,"" said FIFA in a statement. The Arena de Baixada venue, home to Atletico Paranaense in the southern state of Parana, is being expanded for the World Cup with new seats added alongside the pitch and capacity raised to 40,000. Officials claim the stadium should now be ready by May 15, with work set to intensify yet further and a minimum of 1,500 workers guaranteed to be on-site. Nonetheless, FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke warned that the pace of improvement must not falter. ""It is essential that the works are maintained at the required levels and that a collective effort by all the stakeholders involved in Curitiba continues,"" he said. ""It is a race against a very tight timeline and will require regular monitoring, but we are counting on the commitment made by the Atletico Paranaense, the city and the state of Curitiba."" Some may question the decision to intensify work when six construction workers have died in the rush to meet FIFA's World Cup deadlines. But Luis Fernandes, Brazil's Deputy Sports Minister, said he was delighted to see the ""three measures plan"" working out. These cover the progress on construction, improved financial guarantees as well as increased commitments by local organizers. ""It is great to see the significant progress made since our last visit. It's a city which lives and breathes football,"" said a man who is also the executive coordinator within the government for the FIFA World Cup. Curitiba is one of four stadiums that missed FIFA's December deadline for completion. Aside from simply finishing the stadium, local officials must also carry out a number of security tests at new arenas to ensure that they are both safe and fully operational. Spain-Australia aside, Curitiba is also set to host the following group games: Iran-Nigeria, Honduras-Ecuador and Algeria-Russia. Preparations for the World Cup have been controversial in Brazil. Protesters are outraged at what they consider lavish spending on the World Cup as well as the 2016 Olympic Games. Brazil has not hosted the World Cup since 1950 -- when it lost 2-1 in the deciding match to Uruguay. The 2014 tournament is due to open on June 12 with Brazil taking on Croatia in Sao Paulo's Arena Corinthians, a stadium which has also had its own renovation issues.","Curitiba's Arena da Baixada retains World Cup status after satisfying FIFA .

"(CNN) -- An advocate for the family of Cameron Todd Willingham, executed six years ago after a fire killed three of his daughters, is sharply questioning the objectivity of the head of the Texas commission looking into whether the man was rightly convicted. Stephen Saloom, the policy director of the nonprofit legal advocacy group the Innocence Project, brought up a comment attributed last week to John Bradley, chairman of the Texas Forensic Science Commission, during the public comments portion of that panel's meeting Friday. According to the published report, Bradley said that anti-death penalty groups wanted to hold up Willingham -- convicted in 1992 after a jury determined he deliberately set the fire that killed his three girls -- as a ""poster boy"" for their cause. Bradley questioned that approach, calling Willingham ""a guilty monster."" ""This is a very clear statement, 'Willingham is a guilty monster,' that brings into question the reliability of your chairman,"" said Saloom. Bradley downplayed the criticism as ""New York lawyers"" making ""personal attacks, rather than legal arguments."" Founded by Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld, the Innocence Project is a New York-based nonprofit that pursues legal challenges and push policy reforms aimed at exonerating people wrongfully convicted of crimes and preventing future injustices. Death-penalty opponents have said an impartial review of Willingham's case could lead to the unprecedented admission that the state executed an innocent man. Willingham's daughters -- 2-year-old Amber and 1-year-old twins Karmon and Kameron -- died when their Corsicana, Texas, home went up in flames in 1991. The state's fire marshal, Manuel Vasquez, told jurors in Willingham's trial that the fire was set intentionally and spread quickly due to an inflammable liquid. While a jury convicted Willingham of murder, three reviews of evidence by outside experts found the arson determination was based on outdated or faulty science. The first of those reports was sent to Gov. Rick Perry's office and submitted to appeals courts before Willingham's execution, while the other two came after his death. The last of those was ordered in 2008 by the Texas Forensic Sciences Commission, itself authorized in 2005 by an act of the Texas state legislature. In that report, Maryland-based fire science expert Craig Beyler concluded that the arson finding ""could not be sustained"" -- based on current-day investigative standards, as well as those in place in 1991. But two days before the panel was set to hear from Beyler, Gov. Rick Perry shook up the commission with three appointments, including one to replace the panel's chairman. Perry later called the move ""pretty normal protocol,"" since the departing members' terms had expired. As governor, he had signed off on Willingham's execution, and critics have accused him of trying to derail a review of that case. Perry has said he's confident Willingham was guilty, while police in Corsicana say other evidence beyond the arson testimony supports the prosecution. The Forensic Science Commission's movement on the investigation has slowed as the board's new chairman, Bradley, urged a review of the panel's operating rules. Bradley, who was appointed to his current job as Williamson County district attorney in 2001 ahead of his election one year later, said this summer that the Willingham probe ""absolutely"" will continue, though he would not say when. In July, the Forensic Science Commission found that arson investigators used flawed science in their probe of the Willingham matter, but were not negligent and did not commit misconduct. At Friday's hearing, Saloom noted ""concerns"" about several moves that Bradley had made and questioned whether it was necessary to ""revisit everything"" that the commission had done prior to Bradley's appointment. ""It's pretty clear that the commission was going along pretty swimmingly until Gov. Perry ... appointed Bradley as the new commissioner,"" added Paul Cates in a phone interview with CNN. ""Since he has been part of the new commission, he's tried to stop the commission from doing what we believe that it should be doing."" Later in the hearing, several of the Forensic Commission's members engaged in a heated exchange over the Willingham case and the panel's role. Dr. Garry Adams, for instance, said ""it is important to maintain credibility"" given the intense media spotlight on the case, while fellow members Lance Evans and Dr. Sarah Kerrigan also questioned the validity of Willingham's conviction. But Bradley said that much of the debate over Willingham's case was being fanned by the media and other outside influences. He also noted that authorities, ranging from parole boards to the U.S. Supreme Court, had looked into the trial and conviction ahead of Willingham's execution. ""We're being used, and we should recognize that,"" Bradley said. On Thursday in Texas, District Court Judge Charlie Baird rebuffed a request by Navarro County District Attorney Lowell Thompson that he step aside as he opened a hearing into whether Willingham's name should be cleared six years after his execution. Members of Willingham's family pushed for the hearing, claiming that ""junk science"" led to a wrongful conviction and execution.","NEW: Texas board members in heated exchange over whether man wrongfully executed .

"Redwood City, California (CNN) -- Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator of beloved Nintendo game franchises including ""Super Mario,"" ""Donkey Kong"" and the ""Legend of Zelda,"" wants to make something new. ""I am really keen to work on something really new, which eventually is going to be important for the future of Nintendo,"" he said, through a translator, in an interview here at Nintendo's offices on Thursday. ""I would like to try to do something which might be able to expand the boundary or the definition of video games."" Miyamoto spoke with CNN the day after Wired reported that the game visionary would step down as a top Nintendo director and producer overseeing the development of games and products. CNN has a syndication agreement with Wired. A Nintendo spokeswoman disputed the Wired report, which quotes Miyamoto telling colleagues that he is ready to retire. Miyamoto was being sarcastic, but that nuance was lost in translation, she said. ""Miyamoto's role at Nintendo is not changing,"" the company said in a statement. ""He will continue to be a driving force in Nintendo's development efforts."" The 59-year-old video-game pioneer may spend less time working directly on blockbuster games in Nintendo's biggest franchises, he said. But he will have a senior role, which involves helping to determine the future direction of Nintendo's hardware and software. ""We've got to incorporate something new all the time,"" Miyamoto said. ""Everything starts from something small whenever we are trying to find out something new."" Miyamoto suggested in the interview that he may be tiring of shepherding each new entry into the franchises he dreamed up decades ago. The three biggest games Nintendo launched in the last month are sequels. As its name implies, ""Mario Kart 7"" for the 3DS hand-held system is the seventh in the go-cart racing series. There were more than a dozen ""Zelda"" games before the ""Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword"" for the Wii. And who can keep count of how many adventures Mario was in before ""Super Mario 3D Land?"" Here's a telling number: Miyamoto said the word ""new"" more than a dozen times in the course of an interview that lasted just under an hour. He suggested that with execs like Eiji Aonuma, who runs the ""Zelda"" series, Nintendo's most prized franchises are in good hands. Miyamoto said he's instilled in the teams a desire to make big changes often and constantly perfect their products. Miyamoto declined to describe his new project in depth. He mentioned gyroscopes and wireless proximity communication, both of which are built into the Nintendo 3DS, as technologies he'd like to tap in the future. To demonstrate his wacky thinking, he said he had considered working on a digital globe with a map of the world that people could carry around with them. Ideas for games often come from encounters in Miyamoto's own life, he said. As legend has it, the idea for Pikmin, a decade-old game in which an alien leads a race of plantlike creatures, sprang from Miyamoto's garden. ""I'm the person who thinks very differently,"" Miyamoto said. ""I'm the guy who believes in the numerous possibilities of video games. Even by looking around and taking advantage of the existing video-game technologies, we can certainly make something brand new.""","Shigeru Miyamoto created the Donkey Kong, Mario and Zelda characters and games .

"(CNN) -- A Connecticut woman pleaded for police to ""please hurry"" to save a friend from an attack by a pet chimpanzee, according to emotional 911 recordings released Tuesday by Stamford police. Police say Travis, seen here as a younger chimp, was like a child to his owner, Sandra Herold. ""He's ripping her apart,"" Sandra Herold, 70, tells dispatchers about her pet, Travis. With the chimp squealing in the background, Herold cries out, ""He's killed my friend!"" The victim, Charla Nash, 55, remains hospitalized with life-threatening injuries after the chimp, once featured in television commercials for Coca-Cola and Old Navy, attacked her Monday afternoon, police said. Nash had just arrived at Herold's house when Travis jumped on her and began biting and mauling her, causing serious injuries to her face, neck and hands, according to Stamford Police Capt. Rich Conklin. Conklin said the attack was unprovoked, but he described it as ""brutal and lengthy.""  Watch how owner made frantic call to police » . Herold had called Nash to her house to help get 14-year-old Travis back inside after he used a key to escape. While her friend was being attacked, Herold was unable to pull the primate off. She then called 911 before stabbing the chimp with a butcher knife and hitting him with a shovel. Neither fazed Travis, who police said had been like a child to Herold. A Stamford police officer later shot the chimp multiple times after the primate went after him inside a police cruiser, Conklin said. Travis returned to the house, where police found him dead. Conklin estimated that Travis weighed close to 200 pounds. Conklin couldn't confirm media reports that the chimp had Lyme disease, though he did say investigators were taking their time with the case to determine what may have provoked Travis to attack Nash. Animals often do not exhibit symptoms of Lyme disease, caused by the bite of certain types of ticks, although aggression is a possible symptom, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Conklin said Nash had recently gotten a haircut that changed her appearance significantly. Conklin said the chimp had been acting ""rambunctious"" earlier, prompting Herold to put Xanax in a cup of tea for him to drink. He did not know if the animal had been prescribed the medicine or if Herold had ever given her pet such a mixture before.  Watch wildlife biologist Jeff Corwin talk about the dangers of chimps » . Conklin added that his department is not used to dealing with cases such as this, and they were trying to familiarize themselves with laws and regulations before deciding if charges will be filed. Conklin said this isn't the first interaction his officers have had with Travis. The chimp, who was well known and liked in the community, escaped in 2003 and ""wreaked havoc"" on the streets of Stamford for a couple of hours, Conklin said. Travis' body was removed from the home and taken to two locations: His head was taken to the state lab for a rabies test and the body was taken to the University of Connecticut for an animal autopsy. Conklin said this is standard procedure. The chimp, who was known to walk around town, sometimes without a leash, also liked to surf on the Internet and was able to change the TV channel with a remote, according to a Stamford Advocate article. The paper also reported that Travis watered plants, was able to feed hay to his owner's horses, ate at a table with the rest of the family and sometimes drank wine from a stemmed glass.","Chimp squeals on 911 tape as owner cries out, ""He's killed my friend!""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Transportation Security Administration is giving its airport checkpoint officers a new tool: a kit to test for explosive powders. If the X-ray machine detects a potentially hazardous powder, a sample will be mixed with a solution for testing. The TSA said Tuesday it is deploying the kits to all U.S. airports this week, but said it will have little noticeable impact on passengers. Travelers can still board planes with powders such as baby formula, makeup and medicines. ""The majority of passengers won't notice any difference in checkpoint procedures,"" said TSA spokeswoman Kristin Lee. ""This is just one additional layer of security that helps bolster our explosive detection capability."" While there is no specific threat at this time involving explosive powders, the new kits will help protect against the possibility that terrorists could board a plane and use the powder as a component in an improvised explosive device, the TSA said. In practice, the initial screening process will not change. Passengers will still pass their carry-on bags through an X-ray machine. But if the X-ray machine detects a potentially hazardous powder, the powder container will be removed, a small sample will be taken and the sample will be mixed with a solution for testing. During pilot tests late last year, a ""very small percentage"" of the baggage stream required additional tests, said Lee, who declined to give specific numbers, citing security concerns. The vast majority of common powders -- infant formula, medication and makeup -- did not need additional screening, she said. If powder does need another level of screening, it will be done in a way that avoids contamination of the product, and passengers will be made aware of the test, she said. Any powder determined to be a potential threat will not be permitted into the secure area. In the past, transportation security officers had to rely on TSA explosive specialists or local law enforcement to check out powders that required additional screening. The kits cost an average of $145 each, the TSA said. Three years ago, the TSA and its counterparts overseas imposed severe restrictions on the amount of liquids passengers could carry on planes after British authorities uncovered a plot to use flammable liquids to destroy at least seven transatlantic airliners. Those restrictions remain in place. On Monday, a British court convicted three men in the 2006 plot.","TSA kits will allow testing for explosive powders .

"(CNN) -- A group of indigenous Australian protesters made headlines for a second day in a row Friday after they gathered outside the Australian Parliament and set fire to the country's flag. The move came a day after security officers dragged Prime Minister Julia Gillard out of a Canberra restaurant after scores of angry protesters surrounded the building during a luncheon ceremony. Aborigine leaders on Friday criticized the actions of the group, saying they jeopardized efforts to reconcile indigenous Australians with the broader society. Video on the website of the Australian Broadcasting Corp. showed a circle of protesters outside Parliament in Canberra setting light to an Australian flag and chanting, ""Always was, always will be Aboriginal land."" ""I think it was totally uncalled for,"" said Tom Calma, a co-chair of Reconciliation Australia, which promotes the improving of relationships between Aborigines and the wider Australian community. ""It's just not acceptable that they burn the flag of Australia."" The police are investigating the lighting of a fire in an unauthorized place, a police spokeswoman said. She said the act of burning the Australian flag is not a criminal offense in Canberra. The move by the protesters, connected to a long-running Aboriginal demonstration known as the ""tent embassy,"" was likely to add to dismay across the country after the disturbance involving Gillard on Thursday, Australia's national day. Security officers took Gillard and opposition leader Tony Abbott out of the restaurant after between 50 and 100 protesters circled it during a lunchtime ceremony, bashing windows and brandishing sticks and rocks, according to the police. Gillard was presenting medals to emergency service workers during an event for the national day. A spontaneous protest erupted nearby among an Aboriginal rights group commemorating the 40th anniversary of the tent embassy. Protesters were chanting ""shame"" and ""racist"" as they banged on the restaurant's three glass sides, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corp. They were apparently upset about remarks Abbott made earlier Thursday suggesting it may be time to reconsider the tent embassy's relevance. The makeshift embassy was set up 40 years ago by four Aboriginal men who planted a beach umbrella on the lawn in front of Parliament House in Canberra to protest the failure of the coalition government at the time, led by Prime Minister William McMahon, to recognize Aboriginal land rights. It has endured despite successive government attempts to close it. ""I think the indigenous people of Australia can be very proud of the respect in which they are held by every Australian,"" Abbott had said in response to a question about whether the tent embassy was still relevant, according to a transcript of the comments posted on his website. ""And yes, I think a lot has changed since then and I think it probably is time to move on from that."" Local media reported that Gillard was visibly shaken, and stumbled during the encounter. Photographs showed her being led to a waiting vehicle by a group of at least seven security officers, losing a shoe in the process. Video showed her being hustled into the vehicle, surrounded by security officers, some carrying shields, as protesters shouted, ""Shame on you."" The shoe was collected by protesters, who proclaimed it a trophy. But Aboriginal leaders were unimpressed. ""It's pretty appalling behavior,"" said Mick Gooda, the commissioner for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander social justice at the Australian Human Rights Commission. ""And while we enjoy the right to protest and raise issues in this country, I don't think we should be resorting to that type of violence,"" he said Friday on Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio. There was also criticism of the protesters' actions in the Australian press. ""Those who want to preserve the embassy should make their point in a peaceful, respectful way,"" said an editorial on Friday in The Australian, a national daily. ""Their actions yesterday can only have damaged their cause."" There were no injuries Thursday, and no arrests were made, the police said. Video from the ABC showed some minor struggles breaking out between the authorities and protesters. A spokesman for the tent embassy, Mark McMurtrie, said Abbott's remarks and the police's behavior had incited the disturbance. Speaking Friday on Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio, McMurtrie said that news media coverage of the events had overly dramatized the protesters actions. ""There was no threat to them at all,"" he said, referring to Gillard and Abbott. The episode took place against the backdrop of efforts to change the nation's constitution to give better recognition to indigenous Australians, often referred to as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Last week, a panel issued a government-commissioned report suggesting ways the constitution could be altered to achieve that aim. Indigenous Australians have suffered at the hands of later settlers and the government they established. Australian politicians have since apologized for the past mistreatment, but Aborigines remain disadvantaged socially and economically compared with the overall population. Explicit references to Aborigines in the original Constitution, drafted in the late 19th century, were subsequently deemed to be negative. Australians voted overwhelmingly to remove those points in a 1967 referendum, but many people say the document can be further improved to acknowledge the role of the country's indigenous population. The panel -- which included Aboriginal leaders, business executives, legal experts and members of the main political parties -- has handed over its report to Gillard, whose government has promised to hold a referendum on the matter by the next general election. The events of the past two days may have made that process more complicated for those in favor of the referendum. ""I think it's going to increase the challenge,"" said Calma of Reconciliation Australia. ""There was always going to be a challenge to get people on board with the constitutional changes."" He said the tent embassy protesters' actions would detract from ""successful advocacy taking place between indigenous groups and the government at the moment on reconciliation."" CNN's Hilary Whiteman and journalist Hugh Williams contributed to this report.","NEW: Australian police are investigating the lighting of a fire in an unauthorized place .

"(CNN) -- You've been in an accident. The police officer goes through the normal drill, asking for your license and registration. Then she goes a step further. ""Could I have your cellphone, please?"" she says. New legislation proposed by a New Jersey state Sen. James Holzapfel would let cops confiscate cellphones if they have ""reasonable grounds"" to believe that the driver was talking or texting when the wreck occurred. Officers would be required to return the phone after thumbing through its history. ""A lot of your accidents are happening due to distracted driving,"" Fair Lawn Police Sgt. Brian Metzler told CNN affiliate News 12. The trick, he said, is proving it. ""They're just going to say they're not paying attention. 'Were you on the cellphone?' 'No, I wasn't the cellphone' and it ends right there."" The legislation is designed to cut down on distracted driving. But it comes at a time when revelations that the government has been monitoring our phone calls and online activities have shaken our sense of privacy. The bill set off alarm bells with the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey. ""Our State and Federal Constitutions generally require probable cause before authorizing a search, particularly when it comes to areas that contain highly personal information such as cellphones,"" said Alexander Shalom of the ACLU-NJ. ""The legislature cannot authorize searches unless there is probable cause, therefore the bill is likely susceptible to a constitutional challenge."" Distracted Driving Laws . The distraction of technology . While the New Jersey bill is a bold new move in the battle against distracted driving, driver distractions are hardly new. Everything from billboards, to beautiful scenery, to pretty girls, have distracted drivers since the advent of automobiles. But new technologies are creating a growing storm of distractions for drivers, like cellphone apps, GPS units and music players, with the thousands of songs they put at our fingertips. In addition to taking a driver's eyes off the road and hands off the wheel, the devices can engage people's minds so that they're paying less attention to the task of driving, experts say. The cost of distracted driving . An often-quoted study on distracted driving known as the ""100 car study"" was conducted in 2003 and 2004 -- before the introduction of Facebook (2004), Twitter (2006), the iPhone (2007), and iPhone apps (2008). Since then, 11 states have banned talking on hand-held cellphones while driving, and 41 states have outlawed texting when operating a motor vehicle. Earlier this year, U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said some 3,000 people were killed and 387,000 injured in 2011 in accidents involving distracted drivers. But police reports are not a reliable source of information for the cause of distracted driving accidents, said Anne McCartt of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The cause of accidents is frequently not reported, and there are very large differences across the states, McCartt said. The best studies, she said, used phone records to determine if drivers were possibly distracted at the time of a crash, she said. Just what New Jersey has in mind. Information from a report by Mike M. Ahlers is included in this story.","Cops could check texting and cellphone call logs under a New Jersey bill .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Anti-Semitic incidents worldwide dropped sharply in 2010 from their peak in 2009, according to an annual report issued by an Israeli university on the eve of the nation's Holocaust Memorial Day. However, the levels are significantly higher than they were a decade ago, when the upward trend began, according to the report from Tel Aviv University's Steven Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Anti-Semitism and Racism and the Kantor Center for the Study of European Jewry. ""The important question that must be asked today is: Have we learned the lessons of the Holocaust in the world? And to our great regret, the answer is no,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting. ""A renewed anti-Semitism is spreading. Various forces are joining together and flooding the world with anti-Semitism. The hatred of Jews and the denial of their existence have turned into hatred of the Jewish state and denial of its existence."" According to the report, major incidents of physical violence, direct threats and major acts of vandalism fell by 46 percent, from 1,129 in 2009 to 614 in 2010. Although it represents a decrease, researchers pointed out the figure of 614 is the third-highest reported since worldwide statistics began to be monitored in the late 1980s. The 2009 peak was attributed to the Israeli incursion into Gaza in early 2009, which the authors said sparked violence against Jews. ""Since Jews and Israelis are often conflated into a single collective, events in the Middle East often provoke anti-Jewish groups and individuals into perpetrating hostile activities against local Jews."" In 2010, the largest number of violent incidents took place in the United Kingdom, France and Canada. The three nations saw 60% of all worldwide incidents, the report said. The report also expressed concern over ""countless anti-Semitic diatribes, speeches, press articles and especially the electronic posts in almost every possible form on the internet ... the central themes were the Jewish - Zionist world power and conspiracy, the demonization and the delegitimization of Israel mainly by comparing it to Nazi Germany and labeling it an apartheid state."" Holocaust Memorial Day begins at sundown on Sunday. It marks the anniversary of the Warsaw, Poland, ghetto uprising, which began April 19, 1943, when German troops and police attempted to deport its surviving inhabitants. Jews held out against the Germans for 27 days. About 300 Germans and 7,000 Jews were killed in the violence. The memorial day is also observed in the United States. Congress established the Days of Remembrance as the nation's annual commemoration of the Holocaust, according to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Libya's foreign ministry compound caught fire Saturday just two days after the country's prime minister was kidnapped and a day after a car bomb exploded outside of the Swedish consulate. The fire burned on the ministry grounds and but did not reached the building. But the flames rose up to the height of its roof. Emergency vehicles responded to the fire. The kidnapping . Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan on Friday described his kidnapping this week as an attempted coup carried out by political opponents bent on toppling his government. Zeidan was abducted early Thursday from a luxury hotel in Tripoli and held for several hours by militia gunmen before being released, an incident that has highlighted the security threat posed by militias that have run rampant since the revolution that ousted Moammar Gadhafi two years ago. ""I don't believe that 100 cars armed with heavy weapons can surround the hotel and lock it down and create checkpoints to prevent people from passing ... without an order from their leadership,"" Zeidan said in televised remarks. ""...This was coup, a coup against the legitimacy"" of the government. Political opponents . Zeidan blamed political opponents for his abduction, saying they had been trying to take over the government. He said his abductors identified themselves as members of the Operations Room of Libya's Revolutionaries, a militia group. They forced their way into his room at the Corinthia Hotel before dawn, he said, carrying forged papers and claiming to have orders from Libya's general prosecutor. They ransacked his room and took his documents and computer, he said. The five-star hotel that Zeidan calls home is popular among government officials, some of whom reside there, including the justice minister. His was not the only room they barged into, he said. Gunmen also entered a number of hotel rooms belonging to diplomatic and international missions. Bogus corruption claim? But the Operations Room of Libya's Revolutionaries said it merely detained him over financial and administrative corruption charges. However, the Justice Ministry said there was no arrest warrant for Zeidan, calling the move a kidnapping. The militia works with the Interior Ministry -- a not altogether uncommon practice in Libya, which has tried unsuccessfully to rein in the many militia groups. Instead, various ministries have teamed up with them for their own needs, including providing security services. Foreign consulates . A car bomb exploded outside the Swedish consulate in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi on Friday morning, damaging the consulate but injuring no one, the office's chief told CNN. Consular chief Anders Nilsson said he was in an apartment at the back of the building when he heard the blast. A ""hail of glass flew through the building."" The building's front was ""entirely black,"" and all the apartment's windows and doors were ""blown out,"" according to Nilsson. ""We found a hubcap belonging to the vehicle inside the consulate,"" he said. Eight people live in the consulate, which closed because of the explosion. The eight will remain elsewhere in Benghazi, Nilsson said. In early October, gunmen attacked the Russian embassy in Tripoli, Russian state media reported. They fled after security guards killed some of the gunmen. Russia evacuated its embassy staff and their families to Tunisia, ITAR-TASS reported. Roving militias . Armed militias have roamed the country largely unchecked since the 2011 ouster of Gadhafi. Gangs of armed men have surrounded key ministries, including the Justice Ministry, trying to force out members of the democratically elected government. Justice Minister Salah Marghani was forced to evacuate after armed militias surrounded his ministry in April. Libyan intelligence services have warned that the country is becoming a haven for al Qaeda to regroup and regenerate itself. Numerous weapons left over after Gadhafi's downfall are providing groups with different motivations to form their own militias, government officials said. CNN's Nic Robertson reported from Tripoli; Yousuf Basil and Chelsea J. Carter from Atlanta. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.","A plume of smoke rises up over the foreign ministry compound in Tripoli .

"(CNN) -- CNN has been awarded one of the highest honors in international journalism -- a Golden Nymph -- for its coverage of the earthquake in Haiti in the 24-hour news program category.

"(CNN) -- While President Obama continues to insist that he has no plans to use U.S. combat troops on the ground in Iraq, Vice President Joe Biden is the latest member of the administration to say there could be a time when those troops are needed. At an event in Des Moines, Iowa, where Biden joined the activist group Nuns on the Bus on Wednesday, he told a reporter that the need for ground troops would be determined ""based on how the effort goes"" in Iraq, according to a media pool report. Biden's statement came hours after the President's spokesman, Josh Earnest, told reporters that ""The President will not review or consider options that involve putting American military personnel on the ground into a combat role."" Earnest's message echoes the President's, in which he pointedly said during an address to the nation two weeks ago that the fight against ISIS ""will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil."" Obama, Kerry: No U.S. troops will be sent into combat against ISIS in Iraq, Syria . But questions about that comment arose Tuesday when a top military commander, Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a Senate hearing that he would recommend, if necessary, that U.S. ground troops ""should accompany Iraqi troops on attacks against specific ISIL targets."" At the Iowa event, Biden referred to Dempsey's statement. ""He said that if in fact, he concluded that was needed, he would request it from the President,"" Biden said, adding: ""His conclusion is that it is not needed now."" CNN's David Chalian contributed to this story.","Vice President Joe Biden suggests ground troops could be used in the future in Iraq .

"(CNN) -- President Obama is celebrated and criticized for greatly accelerating the number of CIA drone attacks in Pakistan, but the similar covert war that he has launched in Yemen has received considerably less attention. The Obama administration has launched an estimated 28 drone strikes and 13 air strikes in Yemen, according to data compiled by the New America Foundation from reliable news reports. By contrast, the administration of George W. Bush only launched one drone attack in Yemen. (The data was gathered from media outlets that include the Associated Press, Reuters, CNN and the Yemen Post.) On April 25, the White House approved a new policy inaugurating a more aggressive campaign of drone strikes in Yemen allowing so-called ""signature"" strikes. These are strikes on individuals whose patterns of behavior signal the presumed presence of an important militant or of a plot against the United States, even if the targeted individual's identity is unknown. Previously, the administration only allowed the U.S. Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) and the CIA to launch drone attacks in Yemen against top-level militants whose names appeared on secret JSOC and CIA target lists and whose locations could be confirmed. These broadened rules of engagement will likely result in the further acceleration of U.S. intelligence and military operations in Yemen, a chaotic, weak state embroiled in several overlapping civil wars. As of June 6, drone strikes and airstrikes had killed an estimated 531 to 779 people in Yemen, 509 to 713 of whom were identified in media reports as militants, according to the New America Foundation's data. Of these deaths, 99% occurred during Obama's presidency. The civilian casualty rate from these strikes is estimated to be between 4% and 8.5%, roughly comparable with the civilian casualty rate from the U.S. drone program in Pakistan, which averaged 5.5% in 2011, according to New America Foundation data.The CIA inaugurated the lethal drone program in Yemen on November 3, 2002, with a Hellfire missile launched from a Predator drone at a vehicle in the province of Maarib, about 100 miles east of the capital city of Sanaa. The attack killed al Qaeda's top operative in Yemen, Qaed Salim Sinan al-Harethi, who was also a suspect in the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole off the Yemeni coast. With al-Harethi in that car were five other militants, all of whom were killed, including U.S. citizen Kamal Derwish. His was the first reported American death to result from the CIA's drone campaign. After the 2002 U.S. drone strike, there was no reported U.S. airstrikes or drone attacks in Yemen until December 2009, when a sustained campaign of attacks began. That change came about because al Qaeda's Yemen-based affiliate, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), has over the past three years attempted a number of terrorist attacks against the United States, launching it from relative obscurity to the top of the U.S. government's list of national security threats. In a statement posted on jihadist websites in December 28, 2009, AQAP claimed responsibility for the attempted ""underwear bomb"" attack on a Detroit-bound passenger airliner three days earlier. And in November 2010, the group claimed responsibility for a plot to send two packages containing bombs hidden in printer cartridges to two Chicago synagogues. The packages were discovered in the United Kingdom and Dubai after Saudi officials provided a tip about the plot. In July 2011, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said the United States was ""within reach of strategically defeating al Qaeda,"" and that he believed of all al Qaeda affiliates, AQAP posed the greatest threat to the U.S. homeland. Al Qaeda in Yemen advertises for Western recruits . Counting drone attacks and airstrikes in Yemen is complicated because it has often been unclear whether attacks were launched from drones or from fighter jets, and villagers regularly provide conflicting accounts of the kinds of aircraft used in these attacks. To make data collection on these strikes even more difficult, diplomatic cables released by the transparency watchdog site WikiLeaks revealed that the Yemeni government has sometimes taken credit for airstrikes that were in fact being carried out by the United States. According to one cable, then-Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh told then-Gen. David Petraeus in January 2010, ""We'll continue saying the bombs are ours, not yours,"" after which Deputy Prime Minister Rashad al-Alimi joked that he had just ""lied"" to the Yemeni Parliament about the American role in such strikes. During the Obama administration, U.S. drones have killed at least 16 key al Qaeda militants in Yemen, including the Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki on September 30, 2011, and Fahd al-Quso who was suspected of involvement in the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole. While the covert drone war is claiming a fast-rising toll, it's not clear it is significantly weakening AQAP.Gregory D. Johnsen, a leading expert on Yemen at Princeton University, points out that al Qaeda's Yemeni affiliate has grown in size during the past three years from around 200 to 300 militants to more than 1,000 fighters and ""controls significant portions of territory in southern Yemen. In parts of Abyan and Shabwa provinces, the organization controls towns in which it has established its own police departments and court systems. It is providing water, electricity and services to these towns. In short, AQAP now sees itself as the de facto government in the areas under its control."" Since the longtime Yemeni strongman Saleh stepped down in February, the American drone strikes and airstrikes have increased. In just three months, the United States launched an estimated 20 strikes. By comparison, there were just 18 attacks in the previous two years. Johnsen asks: ""What happens if this 'missile surge' doesn't work?  What happens next? Does the U.S. fire more and more missiles in the hopes that it will reach a tipping point?"" Given the Obama administration's embrace of drone strikes, the answer to that question seems likely to be: Yes. ________ .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- The family of a man trampled to death in a New York Wal-Mart on Friday filed a lawsuit Wednesday, claiming the store failed to control the crowd pushing to gain entry on one of the busiest shopping days of the year. A temporary worker at this Wal-Mart was crushed to death when shoppers rushed into the store last week. Jdimytai Damour, 34, a temporary worker, was crushed as he and other employees tried to unlock the doors of the Wal-Mart at Green Acres Mall. The wrongful-death lawsuit, filed in New York Supreme Court by the family's attorney, Jordan Hecht, names Wal-Mart and the mall's owner, manager and security firm as defendants. The lawsuit alleges that Damour's death was caused by the ""wanton disregard for public safety and gross negligence of the defendants."" Hecht also filed a notice of claim against Nassau County to preserve the family's right to file a lawsuit against its police department. ""When they heard of how he was eventually killed, that he died of asphyxiation, they were visibly shaken. They are angry because this was preventable, and have therefore exercised their right to seek justice in the court,"" Hecht said in a written statement. The family is making funeral arrangements for Damour, Hecht said. ""They appreciate the outpouring of sympathy from across the country. They are terribly upset about what happened to their family member,"" Hecht said. On Tuesday, lawyers said two Nassau County men who claim they were injured at the store also are suing Wal-Mart. Their lawyers also filed a notice of a $2 million claim against the Nassau County Police Department. The mall's owners, Vornado Realty Trust, refused comment on the lawsuit in a statement issued Wednesday. ""We are saddened by the tragic occurrence, but we do not comment on pending or threatened litigation,"" the company said. Hank Mullany, Wal-Mart's northeast division president, released a statement about Damour's death Wednesday, which began by saying that Thursday morning, the company will release November's sales numbers. ""This event is overshadowed by the tragic death of Jdimytai Damour at our Valley Stream, New York, store. We have been in communication with members of his family to do what we can to help them through this difficult time,"" the statement said. ""We will continue to work with local law enforcement officials so that together we can implement even stronger safety measures going forward.""","Temporary worker Jdimytai Damour was crushed while he unlocked store's doors .

"(CNN) -- Defeat could be near for Syria's embattled regime, NATO and Syrian ally Russia said Thursday. ""I think now it's only a question of time,"" NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in Brussels, Belgium, where he and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced the deployment of two Patriot air-defense batteries to Turkey's border with Syria. The al-Assad government is ""approaching collapse,"" Rasmussen said. ""I urge the regime to stop violence, to realize what is the actual situation and initiate a process that leads to the accommodation of the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people."" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov offered a similar view from Moscow, noting what he said were rebel reports that victory was imminent. ""We need to look the facts in the eye,"" the state-run RIA Novosti news service quoted Bogdanov as saying. ""Unfortunately, we can't exclude a victory by the opposition."" His comments came as opposition groups said they had seized a military base near Damascus and amid calls by the Local Coordination Committees for rebels to push for the fall of the capital. ""We all know that the battle is not going to be easy and that the regime will defend its existence by the most brutal means, as we have become accustomed to seeing,"" the opposition group said. ""We know that the regime will spare no resources in destroying any hold it may have before its collapse, as we have witnessed in all other Syrian cities."" Diplomatic efforts to help end the 21-month conflict, which opposition activists say has claimed more than 42,000 lives, have so far failed. A rebel victory would unleash a host of complications for the shattered country, including the need to quickly assemble a functioning government; to provide humanitarian assistance as winter approaches; and to address the status of the chemical weapons currently held by regime forces. U.S. official: Syria uses Scud missiles against rebels . The regime has shown no signs of backing down. On Thursday, the LCC reported that 138 people had been killed by government forces, including seven children and four women. Sixty-nine of the deaths occurred in Damascus and its suburbs, it said. Syrian state TV, citing a foreign ministry official, denied Thursday Western accusations that the government has used Scud missiles against rebels inside the country, a move analysts and world leaders have described as a dangerous escalation in President Bashar al-Assad's campaign against the rebellion. A U.S. official said Syrian forces in Damascus loyal to al-Assad had fired at least four short-range Scud missiles from the capital into northern Syria, presumably at rebel groups. Rasmussen said NATO also had detected launches this week. ""We can't confirm details of the missiles, but some of the information indicates they were Scud-type missiles,"" Rasmussen said. ""The use of such indiscriminate weapons shows utter disregard for the lives of the Syrian people. It is reckless, and I strongly condemn it."" Aleppo Today TV becomes vital news source amid Syria's chaos . The predictions of defeat for al-Assad and his forces come amid rising international recognition of the Syrian opposition. On Tuesday, President Barack Obama extended U.S. recognition to the rebel coalition. The more than 100 nations in the Friends of Syria group followed suit on Wednesday and pledged at least $110 million in humanitarian aid. Coalition Vice President George Sabra said rebels were pleased with the gestures, but had hoped the United States would go further by naming the group not just as a legitimate representative of the Syrian people but as their sole legitimate representative. Syrian officials belittled the declarations. Information Minister Omran al-Zoebi said the recognition was comparable to Syria recognizing ""Liverpool Football Club as the sole representative of the British people while in fact it represented very little,"" Britain's Independent newspaper said. As fighting subsides, Aleppo residents find little left . Also Thursday, Amnesty International urged rebel leaders to free a Ukrainian journalist accused of working with Syrian government officials and to respect international accords on human rights. ""There are increasing reports of opposition forces carrying out horrific abuses of captured government soldiers, journalists and some other civilians,"" Amnesty said Thursday. ""The coalition must condemn these grave abuses in the strongest possible terms and do its utmost to prevent them."" The LCC called on rebels to deliver a knockout punch to the regime while protecting civilians, religious sites and the nation's cultural heritage. It also urged rebels to preserve any documents found in offices of state security services seized by rebels in preparation for possible war crimes trials. ""These documents contain massive amounts of incriminating evidence against the regime and its symbols and will be required to hold the regime accountable, compensate victims and retain a historical record of decades of state behavior,"" the group said. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said U.S. government-trained medical workers have reached an estimated 410,000 patients in Syria, performed 22,370 surgeries and had partnered with a group -- which she would not identify for security reasons -- that has set up 20 field hospitals in the country. ""I don't think any of us has a crystal ball as to exactly how this is going to go, but we do believe that the Assad regime's days are numbered,"" Nuland said. ""The opposition in recent days and weeks has made a number of significant captures, in particular major military facility outside of Aleppo with the last Sheik Suleiman base and other important military installations."" She urged Russian officials to withdraw support for the al-Assad regime. An afternoon with a Syrian bombmaker .

"Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- A large oil drilling platform arrived Thursday at the Chilean mine where 33 trapped miners are awaiting rescue. The oil platform is part of Plan C, the third operation to drill to reach the miners. Chilean mining officials have said they believe that drill will dig faster than the other drills currently at work. But they cautioned that the miners, trapped since August 5, still may not be rescued until December. ""This was the most beautiful morning of my life,"" said Elizabet Segovia, the sister of one trapped miner.  ""It's hope for the boys.  Let them build it and get it working quickly."" Progress on the other two rescue operations was mixed, said Andre Sougarret, an engineer overseeing the drilling. The drill being used in Plan A -- a type usually used in mining operations -- reached a depth of 171 meters (187 yards) Thursday, 40 more meters (about 44 yards) since an update given by officials Wednesday. The Plan B drill, usually used to drill water bore holes, hit a snag at 268 meters (293 yards), Sougarret said, when it struck a reinforcement beam used in the mine's operations. The men have been trapped for 36 days now, 2,300 feet under the earth. When rescuers first found them, the miners told officials they had survived for more than 17 days by sharing a jar of peaches and small amounts of tuna and mackerel that were in their shelter. Officials were weighing how to best proceed after the problem with the Plan B drill, but said the drill bit would have to be retrieved and replaced. ""It was totally destroyed,"" Sougarret explained. The Plan B device -- which had been drilling for less time than Plan A's drill, and had already surpassed its distance -- also had a problem Wednesday with a cable malfunction. The drill is widening a hole already drilled into the mine. Sougarret said that once it begins drilling again, it could reach its target -- a workshop used by the miners -- within several days. Then a larger drill could be used until the hole is wide enough so that the miners can be hoisted out, one at a time, in a small cage.","NEW: One miner's sister says the drill is ""hope for the boys""

"(CNN) -- Alexis Ohanian is a champion of the Internet as a catalyst that lets anyone become a publisher or a promoter of worthwhile causes. But for his first book -- which happens to be about that very topic -- Ohanian is turning to the traditional publishing channels. The book will tentatively be called ""Without Your Permission: How the 21st Century Will Be Made -- Not Managed,"" said Ohanian, who co-founded website aggregator Reddit and started his own independent book publisher. To develop the book, he and his agent sought the services of Business Plus, an imprint of the Hachette Book Group-owned Grand Central Publishing. ""There's a big value that going through a traditional publisher brings to someone like me,"" Ohanian said in a phone interview from Malmo, Sweden, where he was speaking at a conference. ""Frankly, I just needed the help."" The tiny, charitable publisher that Ohanian runs, called Breadpig, puts out books for popular Web comics, such as XKCD and Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal. Because those websites already had fans accustomed to paying for posters, T-shirts and other merchandise, Breadpig did not need to focus on marketing, building online storefronts or dealing with retailers, as most book publishers do. After co-founding, leading and now advising Reddit, which continues to grow as its peers have withered, Ohanian helped launch the fast-growing travel search website Hipmunk. He relinquished his role as head of marketing this summer in order to focus on writing and on his speaking engagements. People in the publishing industry began approaching Ohanian in 2009 after he gave a TED talk about an obscure Web meme called Mister Splashy Pants. The name is taken from a Greenpeace mascot that some blogs and Reddit users helped promote. The book will combine advice for building successful startup ventures and marketing secrets with examples of heartwarming stories about using the Internet for grass-roots campaigns. It will also include doodles, which perhaps shouldn't be surprising coming from the man who designed the logos for Breadpig, Hipmunk and Reddit. ""Without Your Permission"" is expected to be published in early 2013, according to Rick Wolff, the publisher and editor-in-chief for Business Plus. The publishing house has produced best-sellers from CNN founder Ted Turner, former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Hank Paulson, and Zappos founder Tony Hsieh. Ohanian, at 28, is the least experienced of the group, despite his major accomplishments since graduating from the University of Virginia. ""This guy is a real personality, and he obviously knows the Internet,"" Wolff said. ""There are a lot of books out there about how to become a success on the Internet. Most of them don't sell much."" However, Ohanian has Wolff and his team convinced. If the budding author can help rename a serious Greenpeace initiative as Mister Splashy Pants, maybe his viral abilities can sell books, too.","Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian says he is writing a book .

"(CNN) -- Google expanded the digital world of cloud computing on Tuesday, announcing the rollout of ""Google Drive."" The service, which will give users 5GB of free remote storage and additional space for a monthly fee, puts the Web giant in competition with Apple and Microsoft, as well as specialized services like Box and Dropbox, in a space that increasingly looks like the future of computing. ""This is really just the next step in the evolution of Google Cloud,"" Scott Johnston, group product manager for Google Drive, told CNN. ""It's really letting people live more in the cloud by connecting them more easily with all the devices they have."" Google Cloud already lets users store e-mail and other documents. Cloud computing allows users to store documents and files, even large ones, on remote servers. Its promise is to make storage space on physical hard drives less important, as well as making it easier to seamlessly share, either with others or between multiple devices like laptops, phones and tablets. ""Google Drive is everywhere you are -- on the web, in your home, at the office and on the go,"" reads Google's promotional page for the service. ""So wherever you are, your stuff is just ... there. Ready to go, ready to share."" Google Drive will launch with an Android app for smartphones and tablets running Google's mobile operating system and in conjunction with 20 third-party apps. As one might expect with a Google product, a big feature of Google Drive is a search feature that will allow users to comb through more than 30 types of files, such as Google docs or PDFs. There's also a limited image-search feature, driven by Google Goggles technology, that can recognize famous faces and landmarks, such as Mount Everest. The service will immediately be available for PCs and Macs, as well as Android. iPhone and iPad availability is promised soon. Users may upgrade to 25GB of storage for as little as $2.50 a month, Google says. As more computer users are accessing the Web or doing work on multiple devices, cloud storage has rapidly evolved as a popular alternative to hard drives. Just this week, Microsoft expanded its SkyDrive product, offering up to 100GB of storage and adding access for the iPhone, iPad and Windows phones. Apple's iCloud service has been available since last June and, according to Apple, has more than 100 million users. And Dropbox, the leading independent cloud-storage service, reportedly has racked up another 50 million. Some observers are dinging Google for being late to expand its cloud offerings. ""Google Drive is a late entrant to the file sharing space and is no doubt a direct response to the success and popularity that consumer file sync services are experiencing,"" said Jesse Lipson, vice-president of data-sharing at Citrix. ""The addition of Google Drive to the cloud storage landscape will make it even more competitive but with Apple, Amazon and Microsoft having offered services for some time, most providers have already got used to swimming with sharks and not getting eaten."" But others say that with a player as major as Google, even a late entrance in the market will have an impact. ""Google Drive is significant because now all Google account holders have one click signup to free file storage, sync and sharing, which has the potential to quickly build a large volume of users,"" said Forrester Research analyst Frank Gillett. ""Integration with Google Docs/Apps and eventually with Gmail will make it more natural and seamless than managing from a separate account ... so, Google Drive will cause more individuals to begin using personal cloud services and more companies, those that use Google Apps, to use cloud-based file sync and sharing."" CNN's Brandon Griggs contributed to this story.","Google rolls out 'Google Drive' cloud service Tuesday .

"Oslo, Norway (CNN)  -- To escape Iran, Mohammad Mostafaei traveled for more then 10 hours on foot and on horseback over the mountains, crossing the border illegally into Turkey. Soon afterwards, he ended up in a detention center for illegal immigrants in Istanbul, where he was incarcerated for nearly a week. After several surreal and sometimes dangerous weeks, Mostafaei's journey appears to finally be over. He now strolls the tidy, rain-soaked streets of Norway's capital, safe from the Iranian security forces who he claims targeted him. But Mostafaei is far from at ease. ""I don't like to be a refugee, nor do I like to work abroad,"" he says. ""My love is to remain in Iran and help people who somehow have been oppressed whether by society or by the law or by the judicial system. But regrettably, I became a victim."" Mostafaei is a human rights lawyer. He specializes in defending Iranians under the age of 18, who have been sentenced to death for crimes ranging from murder to sodomy. Iran ranks second in the world after China for annual executions of prisoners. But according to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, Iran leads the world for the number of death sentences carried out against juvenile defendants. Human Rights Watch reports that since 2005, the Iranian judiciary has executed dozens of Iranians who were convicted of crimes committed below the age of 18. ""I have worked and handled 40 cases so far and out of these, thank God, 18 were saved,"" Mostafaei says. ""Regrettably four were hanged. The rest need help."" In 2008 and 2009, four of Mostafaei's juvenile clients were executed. They include Delara Darabi, who was hung on May 1st 2009 for a murder allegedly committed when she was 17 years old and Behnoud Shojai, executed on October 11th, 2009 for stabbing another teenager to death when he was 17 years old. Human rights groups point out that Iran is a signatory to the UN's International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, both of which prohibit executions for crimes committed under the age of 18. ""These are arbitrary executions,"" argues Mostafaei. For his criticism of this policy, the lawyer says authorities prevented him from traveling outside of Iran for a seven-month period. ""I was contacted several times and warned to watch out. Sometimes I saw that I was being followed,"" he adds. ""My home phones and my offices phones were monitored."" The defense attorney appeared to have finally crossed a red line due to his outspoken defense of Sakine Mohammadi Ashtiani, the 43-year-old mother of two who was sentenced to death by stoning after being convicted of committing adultery. International uproar over the case has been a source of embarrassment for the Islamic Republic. Activists around the world have staged protests demanding Iranian authorities commute the sentence. More recently, the president of Brazil, whose government recently broke with Western countries and voted in the United Nations Security Council against imposing a fresh round of sanctions against Iran over its nuclear program, made a public offer of asylum to help Ashtiani escape the death sentence. Tehran rejected that offer. On July 24th, Mostafaei says he was brought into Tehran's Evin prison for hours of interrogation. He was later released, only to discover that, in his absence, security forces had raided his office and detained his wife and brother-in-law. ""The hostage-taking led me to leave the country,"" Mostafaei says. When Mostafaei was later detained after smuggling himself into Turkey, the Norwegian government intervened at the highest level to have him released. ""There is a courageous man who raises cases-- difficult cases-- which the authorities don't like and he sees himself in a position where he has to flee across a mountain. He sees his wife imprisoned. Well, I think we should wake up and speak out,"" said Jonas Gahr Støre, the Foreign Minister of Norway, in an interview with CNN. Norway's top diplomat says, on principle, his government opposes the death penalty. ""The death penalty against juvenile people is an especially bad thing,"" says Støre. ""Iran being among the countries with the most such cases."" Barely a week after arriving in Oslo under Norwegian government protection, Mostafaei appears to be very much on an emotional roller coaster, swinging rapidly from elation to despair. He relishes the chance to focus attention on Iran's human rights record, which he argues is often over-shadowed by international concern over Iran's nuclear program. ""What matters more inside Iran are human rights issues,"" Mostafaei says. ""Lack of freedom of speech, lack of freedom of thought, the newspapers are not free, the students are not free, the [political] parties are not free...human rights issues in the prosecutors' offices are far more important than issues of world nuclear energy."" But Mostafaei's new international platform for publicity has come at considerable personal cost. On August 7th, Mostafaei's wife Fereshteh Halimi was released on bail after spending 13 days in solitary confinement. ""When they found that my husband was out of Iran and they couldn't reach him and I wouldn't be a good hostage any more, that's when they released me,"" Halimi said in a phone interview with CNN last week. Halimi's father and brother were also briefly detained, but later released after posting bail for the equivalent of tens of thousands of dollars. All three now await trial in Tehran. ""I can imagine that with him being here and the family being there he [Mostafei] feels concerned,"" says Norwegian foreign minister Støre. ""And knowing the track record of the Iranian regime when it comes to people like that I don't question his concern."" ""I hope Iran will get better in the future,"" Mostafaei said, during a rainy walk along a waterfront boardwalk in Oslo. ""But I don't know when. Maybe five years, ten years, I don't know."" Then, his mood momentarily brightened as he pointed across Oslo's harbor, exclaiming ""very beautiful."" A rainbow had appeared over the water... a much-needed sign of hope, perhaps, for a man who has lost his job, his country, and now faces prolonged separation from his wife and daughter.","Mostafaei defended juveniles facing death penalty in Iran .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The Screening Room went to the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane in the heart of London's West End, where a spectacular musical version of ""The Lord of The Rings"" is enjoying a successful run, to meet Indian composer A. R. Rahman, whose blend of Asian culture with rock and Western classical styles has revolutionized the Indian film industry. And now Rahman is about to make his mark in Hollywood. A. R. Rahman, interviewed by CNN's Screening Room . Virtually unknown in Europe and the U.S., Rahman has sold 200 million albums worldwide -- more than the Beatles -- and is worshipped throughout much of Asia, where he's known as the Mozart of Madras. Now he has added a Hollywood film score to his vast repertoire of movie music. Rahman explained to CNN what he thinks makes great movie music. ""A great soundtrack is like 'Laura""s theme', the 'Love Story' theme, 'Chariots of Fire' and all those sorts of things, where it stood by itself,"" he said. But recently, he's noticed a changing mood. ""Now it is becoming too abstract and more ambient and more... I don't know, soundscape-ish, more than melody. People are afraid of melody: 'Oh, that melody is distracting my scene,' it is becoming like that."" And that brings fresh challenges for the makers of film music. ""Now the challenges of the composer are much more,"" he told CNN. ""One needs to know of recording, production, it is not enough to compose a great theme and [know] how it can intertwine with the movie. And with Indian film it is an even greater challenge, because we need to be like Michael Jackson, John Williams, Hans Zimmer and an Indian folk composer all put together. So they expect finesse and they expect versatility."" Rahman's compositions are versatile enough to be used by both Bollywood and Hollywood, a case in point being his music for the Hindi film ""Dil Se,"" which was used almost a decade later by Spike Lee for ""Inside Man."" But for Rahman, the process to create film music is being challenged by increasingly crammed movie schedules. ""There used to be a time where the director and the composer would work together,"" he explained. ""They would develop themes and the director would shoot a scene, but now the world's so fast that people are finishing the movie even before going to a composer."" As well as writing songs and scores, Rahman has featured in many Bollywood films singing the songs which are mimed by the acting superstars. He recently completed a sell-out tour of the U.S. performing highlights from his songbook to devoted fans. He explained to CNN how playback singing is a normal part of Indian film music. ""Well, until I worked in 'Bombay Dreams' six or seven years back, I never realized that it is not cool to have playback singing. Until then, it was the story of Indian films where somebody else lip synchs and somebody else sings."" And Rahman has been converted to the Western model, where those singing on-screen usually provide the vocals themselves. ""In my future projects I would rather have a star who sings,"" he said. Director Shekhar Kapur recruited Rahman and fellow composer Craig Armstrong to provide the score for Cate Blanchett's sequel to ""Elizabeth,"" ""The Golden Age,"" which premieres at Toronto Film Festival in September this year. Kapur described the thrill of working with two such different -- and complementary -- composers. He told CNN, ""Here are two totally different cultures. Craig Armstrong is strings and heart, the skies, choir, angels and devils, and A. r. is modern, restless music."" ""Just to get them together was very interesting for me. To sit there and see both of them jamming together, that was fascinating. They wouldn't talk, they would jam, and out of the jamming came the music. It was great."" Rahman is still getting used to his new-found status as darling of both East and West -- and it leads to a somewhat chaotic lifestyle, as he explained. ""It is terrifying sometimes. I suddenly wake up in Scotland doing music for 'Golden Age,' and suddenly wake up doing an Indian superstar film, but I think after all these years I am probably getting a balance.""

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- The family of a Thai police officer killed in a car crash in Bangkok expressed shock and grief Tuesday over his death, which the grandson of the creator of the Red Bull energy drink has been charged with causing. Police Sgt. Major Wichien Klanprasert was responding to a robbery call when his motorcycle was hit by what a witness described as a black sports car at 5 a.m. on Monday, the Bangkok Police said. The police subsequently arrested Vorayud Yoovidhaya, 27, a prominent member of one of Thailand's richest families whose wealth is connected to Red Bull, and charged him with causing a death with negligence and hit and run. ""I'm so shocked and very sad. I am just stunned,"" said Ubol Thongsanin, one of Wichien's sisters, as she visited the scene of the crash on Tuesday. ""I want to tell the parents that they should teach their children to drive carefully,"" she said. Another sister, Chuanpit Choosurisaeng, had a message for the driver of the sports car that allegedly killed her brother: ""When you have big money, it doesn't mean you can drive carelessly. You must think of others who are sharing the same road, too."" According to the police account, investigators followed the path of leaked oil from the crash scene to the home of Vorayud. Dozens of police surrounded the mansion before entering with a search warrant and discovering a badly damaged black Ferrari. The front was wrecked and its air bags deployed, said Bangkok Police Maj. Gen. Parinya Jansuriya. Vorayud was taken to a police station for questioning and the car was seized by investigators, he said. Vorayud admitted driving the car and hitting the motorcycle, but he claimed he was suddenly cut off by the bike, according to Police Maj. Gen. Aunuchi Lekbumrung. After he was charged, Vorayud was quickly released on a bond of 500,000 baht, about $16,000. The controversial case also resulted in the suspension of a police officer who was accused of having another person pretend to have been driving Vorayud's car. The man who had claimed to have been driving the car was fined 6,000 baht, about $200, the Police Chief Kumronvit Thoopkrachang said. Vorayud's late grandfather, Chaleo Yoovidhaya, teamed with an Austrian businessman to create the Red Bull brand and products based on a Thai drink. His father, Chalerm Yoovidhaya, is an executive with the energy drink company.","Vorayud Yoovidhaya, 27, is a prominent member of one of Thailand's richest families .
