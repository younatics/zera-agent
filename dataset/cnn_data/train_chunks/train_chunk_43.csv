"(CNN) -- Despite some signs that the economy is on the mend, a lack of confidence from consumers and companies alike may hamper job growth during the next few months, economists say. Unlike this point last year, there are some indicators for optimism about the U.S. economy. The market seems to be on a rebound, with stock prices growing steadily since March. Meanwhile, the U.S. Gross Domestic Product, a broad indicator of the economy's strength, grew during the third quarter. It was the largest such growth since the summer of 2007. However, the unemployment rate is staggering. The national rate hit 10.2 percent last month, the first time it has been double digits in more than 25 years. The jobless rate increased in 29 states and the District of Columbia in October, according to a recent Labor Department survey. Thirteen states reported an unemployment rate above the current national rate. Track unemployment numbers by state and industry . There is also concern that the GDP growth is largely the result of the economic stimulus implemented by the federal government and other government initiatives like the ""Cash for Clunkers"" program for automobiles. Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve Chairman, said recently that economic conditions were better than they were a year ago, and a modest recovery was on the horizon. Sounding a note of caution, he said: ""Some important headwinds -- in particular, constrained bank lending and a weak job market -- will likely prevent the expansion from being as robust as we would hope."" Polls suggest many Americans are not confident about the economy. ""Some economic indicators may suggest that the economy has turned the corner -- but try telling that to the American people,"" said Keating Holland, CNN's polling director. More than eight in 10 Americans say that economic conditions are in poor shape, according to a recent CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll. Of that number, 43 percent described the conditions as ""very poor."" See the poll results (pdf) Ali Velshi, CNN's chief business correspondent, said it may not feel as if the economy is in a recovery until the jobless numbers decrease. That may partly explain the poll's findings. Velshi described the American economy as being founded on three pillars. One is the value of a home growing at a rate faster than the cost of owning it, he said. The other is the value of investments -- think of a 401(k) plan or an IRA or savings for kids' education -- increasing at a rate faster than inflation. The third, and most important one, is income, Velshi said. ""You can live without a [buying a] house. You can live without a 401(k). You can't live without an income."" On that front, Bernanke sounded somber during his remarks to the Economic Club of New York on November 16. ""The best thing we can say about the labor market right now is that it may be getting worse more slowly,"" he said. ""Jobs are likely to remain scarce for some time."" Read Bernanke's remarks (pdf) Bernanke said jobs will likely be created next year but a high unemployment rate may still hold through 2010. So, why does unemployment continue to rise while Wall Street seems to be rebounding? ""There's this real disconnect between Wall Street and Mainstreet,"" said Peter Rodriguez, an economist at the University of Virginia. ""Wall Street can benefit from forward-looking financial markets and they've already begun to rise. ""But that doesn't give anyone any new jobs."" Rodriguez said there was ""an ample amount of what you might think of as underemployment in the active workforce."" Let's say you're a manager and you have 50 employees. During tough economic times, you might minimize the pain by cutting people's hours. Instead of working 40 hours, they work 35 hours, and your company limps along during the recession without having to lay off people. ""What that means is, on the return to normalcy, rather than hiring people, you just raise work hours,"" Rodriguez said. Bernanke brought up the dynamic as well last week. ""Recently, we've seen the interesting phenomenon that firms have come out of recessions in aggressive cost cutting mode and in doing so, they've actually created productivity gains,"" he said. CNNMoney: Are things really getting better? Consequently, the number of part-time workers who say they would like a full-time job but can't find one has doubled since the recession began, he noted. However, those gains companies made while cutting back on workers are likely ""limited and probably temporary,"" he said. ""If demand, production and confidence pick up, they will find their labor force stretched thin and they will add new workers,"" he said. The trend might not change until companies and business owners feel confident enough in the economy to start hiring. There are a number of factors that could influence that perspective, including access to credit, lending from banks and overseas competition. They have to feel assured of a recovery to discard their caution and put their money at risk, Rodriguez said. ""They feel better, but not better enough to invest in growth,"" he said. ""They're becoming slightly less timid, but we're still deep in the rehabilitation phase.""","The national unemployment rate is 10.2 percent .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's father wants a judge to order the pop star's estate to pay him a monthly allowance, according to papers filed in court Friday. Joe Jackson, the 80-year-old Jackson family patriarch, was not named in Michael Jackson's 2002 will, which left his wealth to his mother, Katherine Jackson, his three children and undisclosed charities. Brian Oxman, Joe Jackson's lawyer, filed the petition Friday asking for him to be included in the family allowance. The matter will be considered Tuesday when Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff convenes the next hearing on matters related to the probate of Jackson's will, Oxman said. The filing does not publicly specify how much Jackson's father is requesting. Howard Weitzman, one of the lawyers for the estate's special administrators, said Joe Jackson's request ""will be considered as are all requests for money from Michael's estate."" ""It was quite surprising to learn of the request,"" Weitzman said. Michael Jackson's mother and his three children receive a court-ordered allowance from the estate totaling more than $86,000 a month, according to court documents. The money is in addition to the maintenance of the home -- which is owned by the estate -- in Encino, California, where Katherine Jackson lives with her grandchildren, the papers said. Although Joe and Katherine Jackson are still married, Joe Jackson lives in Las Vegas, Nevada. Joe Jackson is credited with launching and guiding his family's show business success, but Michael Jackson had publicly criticized his father's parenting skills. Tuesday's hearing could also see a new challenge by the Jackson family of the 2002 will. Michael Jackson died June 25, but the probate of his will has been slowed by a series of court squabbles between Katherine Jackson's lawyers and the two men now in control of the estate. John Branca and John McClain, who are named as executors in the will, were appointed temporary special administrators to run the estate until the process is completed. Katherine Jackson replaced the lawyers representing her in the estate case last month with attorney Adam Streisand. Another Jackson family lawyer said the change was made because the case was about to take a ""new direction"" based on ""new evidence"" uncovered by the family. Attorney Londell McMillan pointed to questions about the authenticity of the signature on Michael Jackson's will. Tuesday's estate hearing will be Streisand's first appearance in the case. A trial has been tentatively set for December to decide any challenge of the will, although Streisand said last month he expected it to be set for early next year. The A&E network announced Friday that ""The Jacksons: A Family Dynasty"" television series will launch with two hours of programming on Sunday night, December 13. Four of Michael Jackson's brothers -- all except Randy Jackson -- are involved in the show ""as they prepare for a Jackson Five reunion, while also coming to terms with Michael's tragic loss,"" the network said. An A&E programming executive said the ""deeply intimate portrait will provide viewers with a raw and honest look inside a musical dynasty.""","Joe Jackson, who was left out of will, wants judge to give him allowance .

"(CNN) -- The second installment in the ""Twilight"" saga, starring Robert Pattinson as vampire Edward Cullen, Kristen Stewart as his star-crossed love and Taylor Lautner as the wolfboy who loves her, has already ripped through a box office record. According to Hollywood trade magazine Variety, ""New Moon"" is the biggest midnight showing in history, grossing $26.3 million when it opened in 3,514 theaters at 12:01 a.m. Friday. The film even surpassed the supernatural cinema force that is ""Harry Potter,"" collecting more than the $22.2 million that ""Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"" earned during its midnight showing this summer. ""New Moon"" has also easily beaten its own predecessor, ""Twilight,"" which earned $36 million on opening day last year. And while ""Twilight's"" opening weekend was $69.7 million, early reports are that ""New Moon"" will do even better. But along with the ticket sales bounty is backlash. The Vatican released an announcement Friday denouncing the film, which is based on Stephenie Meyer's blockbuster series. ""This film is nothing more than a moral vacuum with a deviant message and as such should be of concern,"" warns the Vatican's culture council leader, Monsignor Franco Perazzolo, in a statement timed to the release of ""New Moon,"" according to E! Online. ""This theme of vampires in 'Twilight' combines a mixture of excesses,"" he continued, ""that, as ever, is aimed at young people and gives a heavy esoteric element."" Yet the kids these days appear to dig the ""excesses"" of ""Twilight."" Still, only time will tell if ""New Moon"" will also outsell the current ""best opening day"" titleholder, ""The Dark Knight,"" which grossed $67.2 million when it opened July 18, 2008.","""New Moon"" grossed $26.3 million from midnight showings alone .

"(CNN) -- The wife of a Colorado father at the center of the ""balloon boy"" saga told authorities that the giant helium balloon was specifically created for a hoax to draw media attention, according to court documents released Friday. The Heene family -- including Falcon, second from right -- on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" last week. Mayumi Heene told Larimer County investigators that she and her husband, Richard Heene, knew that their 6-year-old son Falcon was hiding at their Fort Collins home the entire time, even as police and military scrambled to search for the boy, according to the documents. The admission by Mayumi Heene was made October 17, just two days after the balloon was released, according to the documents. The Heenes initially told authorities that they believed their child had flown away on the balloon, and when the balloon landed without him, they expressed concern that he may have fallen out of the device. The couple hatched the plan about two weeks before the incident and ""instructed their three children to lie to authorities as well as the media regarding this hoax,"" according to the documents. Their motive? To ""make the Heene family more marketable for future media interests."" Calls to David Lane, Richard Heene's attorney, and Lee Christian, Mayumi Heene's attorney, were not immediately returned Friday. Richard and Mayumi Heene are each facing a number of local charges, including conspiracy, contributing to the delinquency of a minor and attempting to influence a public servant, Larimer County Sheriff Jim Alderden said Sunday. Lane told CNN earlier that the sheriff was overreaching and that the family deserve the presumption of innocence. The Federal Aviation Administration is also investigating the incident. Richard and Mayumi Heene met in a Hollywood acting school and pursued fame for their family in the world of reality TV, Alderden has said. The Heenes have appeared on the ABC program ""Wife Swap."" Richard Heene also chases storms, brings his family along and takes videos. TLC, which produces the show ""Jon & Kate Plus 8,"" said the Heenes had ""approached us months ago"" about a possible show, ""and we passed.""","Mayumi Heene says she and husband knew 6-year-old was safe during scare .

"(CNN) -- The woman who was denied a marriage license by a Louisiana justice of the peace because he refused to marry interracial couples said the official should lose his job. Beth McKay says a Louisiana justice of the peace denied her a marriage license since it was an interracial union. Beth McKay said she never could have expected what she heard from Tangipahoa Parish's 8th Ward Justice of the Peace Keith Bardwell when she called his office a week ago to officiate her marriage to her African-American fiance, Terence. McKay spoke with Bardwell's wife to make arrangements for the ceremony. ""At the end of the conversation, she said that she had to ask me a question. She asked if this was an interracial marriage."" When McKay replied yes, she was told, ""Well, we don't do interracial weddings or marriages."" McKay said she was beyond shock. ""We are used to the closet racism, but we're not going to tolerate that overt racism from an elected official."" Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is calling to have Bardwell's license revoked, and Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu is calling for his dismissal -- a notion shared by McKay. ""He's not representing all the people that he is supposed to be representing,"" McKay said. ""He's only representing the people with his same opinions."" McKay later married Terence with the help of another justice of the peace in the same parish. Bardwell has not returned repeated calls from CNN, but he told a local newspaper in a story published Thursday that he was not a racist and he was concerned for the children who might be born of the relationship. Bardwell also said, in his experience, that most interracial marriages don't last. ""We're just kind of hurt, you know?"" McKay told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Friday. ""This doesn't take care of the problem. He's been in his position for 34 years. So, it doesn't take care of the problems that we have to deal with on a daily basis.""  Watch why justice nixed interracial marriage » . McKay said her friends and family have been extremely supportive and she believes this situation occurred for a reason. ""I just think that God puts you in the right positions at the right time in order to stand up to people who -- who choose to live their lives with hate,"" she said. The Supreme Court struck down laws against interracial marriage in the landmark 1967 Loving v. Virginia case. Richard and Mildred Loving, who got married in Washington, D.C., were arrested in their Virginia home with their marriage license framed and hanging on the wall, for the simple fact of being husband and wife.  Watch Bardwell explain his decision » . In the unanimous decision, the Supreme Court said that ""Under our Constitution, the freedom to marry, or not marry, a person of another race resides with the individual and cannot be infringed by the state."" The number of interracial marriages have skyrocketed, nearly quadrupling between 1970 and 2005, the most recent year for which there is census data. As of 2005, nearly 8.5 Americans are living in interracial marriages.","Beth McKay says she's hurt after Louisiana justice of peace denied marriage license .

"Editor's note: Joy Behar's new nightly show debuts Tuesday, September 29 on HLN at 9 PM ET. Joy Behar says Ukranian officials are wrong to try to block Elton John from adopting a 14-month-old boy. NEW YORK (CNN) -- On a recent tour of a Ukrainian orphanage, Elton John and his partner met Lev, a 14-month old HIV-positive boy. They immediately fell in love with the child, but their possible bid to adopt the adorable tiny dancer was rejected by Yuriy Pavlenko, Ukraine's Family, Youth and Sports Minister. Mr. Pavlenko, here are some tips about family, youth and sports. Family doesn't mean a huddle of orphans sharing a few soiled mattresses, it's not youth if you die of AIDS before you reach kindergarten, and wrestling over dinner scraps is not a sport. But that could be Lev's fate now, because the Ukrainian government said Elton and his beau David Furnish are too old to adopt the boy. It sounds like the real reason is they're too gay. John and Furnish tied the knot in 2005, becoming one of Britain's first gay civil unions, but Ukraine doesn't recognize gay unions. Ukrainian Orthodox Church spokesman Father Georgy Gulyaev called Elton John a sinner and said, ""thank God it's impossible under Ukrainian law for [him] to adopt a child."" Apparently in the Ukraine, God's No. 1 priority is preventing gay couples from giving sick kids a better life. God would never want something like that to happen. Father Gulyaev said homosexuality ""represents the dead end of human development."" That's odd, I thought the dead end of human development was represented by 14th century thinking like his. This guy's head is stuck in the Dark Ages. He hasn't even progressed to the Middle Ages yet. Some conservative religious leaders like to harp about the ""damage"" to families done by gay marriage, as if traditional marriage is so perfect. Since many of them have taken vows of celibacy, they've never witnessed firsthand the damage dinner with the in-laws can cause (one of the few advantages of the celibate life, I guess). There are even a few married Bible-thumpers spending their time trying to keep sex out of our lives -- yet they talk about sex more than anyone! Sex is usually the first and only factor they consider when judging -- I mean, when ""dispensing enlightenment upon"" -- others.  Watch Joy Behar speak about adoption » . Sure, Elton John may be gay, but he's also a renowned musician, a celebrated humanitarian, and has been knighted by the Queen of England. In fact, for some people he is the Queen of England. Plus, there's no downside to gay adoption. In the United States, organizations like the National Adoption Center, the American Psychological Association, and the American Academy of Pediatrics all agree that having homosexual parents does not negatively affect children. But you know what does negatively affect children? Growing up with no parents. So now 14-month-old Lev is stuck in some depressing orphanage that makes Guantanamo Bay look like the presidential suite at the Waldorf. He'll likely end up in foster homes and -- if he lives long enough -- maybe he can turn into a bitter, vodka-swilling drunk. All because the Ukrainian government won't let him be adopted by two loving gay parents who are fabulously rich and want to give him a home with the best healthcare available, dressed in Versace jammies and cashmere Huggies. Not to mention all the play dates with Brangelina's kids. Let's hope Sir Elton finds a different, more tolerant country willing to let him be a poor child's loving father. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Joy Behar.","Joy Behar: Elton John, partner mulled adopting 14-month-old boy .

"(CNN) -- Four days of heavy rains triggered a landslide that killed 12 children and eight adults near Mount Kilimanjaro in northern Tanzania, authorities said Friday. Five of the children were under six, said Suzan Kaganda, a police department spokeswoman. The death toll could go up as rescue crews search the area for people reported missing, Kaganda said. Most victims of the late Tuesday landslide live in the Kilimanjaro region near the mountain by the same name, Kaganda said. The mountain is the highest peak in Africa and is a major tourist attraction. U.N. officials warned last month that east Africa is facing mudslides, crop destruction and waterborne diseases as a result of heavy downpour triggered by El Nino weather patterns. Most east African countries have been water-starved in the past few years, exacerbating the results of floods, because a lot of greenery disappeared in the drought.","Most victims of the landslide live in the Kilimanjaro region near the mountain by the same name .

"(OPRAH.com) -- He can saw himself in half, sing a selection of Broadway showtunes and swing on a flying trapeze. Neil Patrick Harris says he'll try to make viewers feel like they're in good hands with him as Emmy host. When Neil Patrick Harris, one of the stars of the hit CBS sitcom ""How I Met Your Mother,"" isn't dabbling in the extraordinary, well, he's probably hosting an awards show. In the late '80s, Neil -- known as NPH to his fans -- landed the starring role on ""Doogie Howser, M.D."" After years of child stardom and teen heartthrob status, Neil left the small screen for the stage. He became a respected Broadway actor, starring in shows like ""Rent,"" ""Cabaret"" and ""Proof,"" before returning to television. Now, millions know Neil as Barney Stinson, the womanizing, slap-happy sidekick on ""How I Met Your Mother,"" which begins its fifth season September 21. Like Billy Crystal and Johnny Carson before him, this man-of-many-talents is also making his mark as an awards show host. On Sunday, September 20, Neil will host the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards. He shares his thoughts on fate, finding balance and making out with his co-star. Kari Forsee: How are you preparing for Emmy night? Neil Patrick Harris: I'm just trying to make sure all the comedy host elements are in place. We'll have a good opening bit and a couple surprise things throughout. We want to balance respecting the show and the doling out of the awards with the sort of random things that will keep the audience's attention in other ways. So that's kind of been my job. You want to make it unique and, yet, classic. That's a tricky dynamic. Oprah.com: Planning an Emmys party? Get 4 entertaining solutions . KF: I can imagine. How often are you rehearsing? NPH: Well, it's sort of a litany of e-mails and phone calls all day with the producers. We had a great opening short film we are going to shoot, and it would be the first thing you shot. That was going to be with Alec Baldwin, and he withdrew at the last minute. So that got scrapped, and we're off to plan D, E or F. It's sort of like now you go: ""That's fantastic, great. We've got that person,"" or ""Oh, that person didn't work. Now what do we do?"" A lot of ""now what do we do?"" questions. KF: Now at the Tony Awards, you sang a, may I say, legendary closing number. Will you be singing at the Emmys, or is dancing more the focus? NPH: I suspect you won't see me dancing very much. That's not my forte. But yeah, I might throw some sort of singing into it. I haven't quite decided. I sort of feel like the Emmys are so classy and glamorous and black tie, the host really needs to respect his job title. I think too much ""Look at me! Look at me!"" as the host of a show that big is counterproductive. So long as I make you feel confident that you're in good hands with me as the host, then it's my real responsibility to introduce you to a lot of other people and elements -- other presenters who are then going to talk to you or other introductions of next sections. That's my role. It's not really to be a song-and-dance man. KF: Did you look back at past Emmy hosts for inspiration? NPH: Very much. Steve Allen hosted the first televised awards, which was the 7th Annual Emmy Awards, in, I think, 1955, and he was great. That was sort of my inspiration for all of this. He just had such a dry wit, a commanding voice, a great presence. You knew when you were watching it that if something went wrong, you could look to him, and he would steer you through it. It was always with great dignity and a dry sense of humor, and he was sort of out there all the time. He was definitely the ""host."" He definitely helped the show, so I like that. Johnny Carson, too, was great. KF: Hypothetically, what would you do if your name was called for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series this year? NPH: Oh my, I would graciously accept, try to keep my speech to a minimum, and then quickly set it backstage, because I have a lot more to do for the next couple hours. KF: Is the award given out early on in the show? NPH: I think it will be within the first hour. It's a nice and refreshing win-win for me, because if I do happen to win, it will be awesome-tastic, and oddly, a bit of a distraction. And if I don't win, it just provides lots of comedy fodder for the rest of the show. So I'm pretty safe either way. It's a tough category, for sure. KF: So the day after the Emmys, a new season of ""How I Met Your Mother"" premieres. Last season's finale left us wondering if your character, Barney Stinson, will finally settle down and start dating Robin Scherbatsky. NPH: They certainly take a stab at it. I know there will be lots of necking and making out. Lots of canoodling between Robin and I. My lips are chapped. They have strong physical chemistry, apparently. KF: ""How I Met Your Mother"" puts a lot of stake in fate. Are you a believer in fate? NPH: I don't know what to make of fate. I certainly don't think you can predetermine things. It feels like if you go out of your way to try to make something happen, it rarely does. But if you allow for good things to happen, they seem to. I think a lot of that is more perception, you know? A lot of people would take getting rear-ended in their car as an example of why their life continues to be one road block after another, and I think a different person can see that same fender bender and be grateful it wasn't worse. That allows them an opportunity to learn something from it -- sort of take some sort of positive elements from that. I think if you try to angle your life in those ways, then fate, destiny, karma opens itself up to you and allows for more growth. Oprah.com: How to get lucky in love and life . KF: I'm curious, how did your father meet your mother? NPH: They were college, fraternity and sorority sweethearts. This was in Albuquerque. She was in Alpha Chi Omega. And he was in, something Pi? They did the whole, you know, he gave her his pin. She was pinned, and they were a couple. Then, they were married, and they've only been with each other. I'm very extraordinarily lucky with my parents. ... We didn't have a lot of money growing up, but we were never made to feel poor. They had amazing senses of humor, senses of music and really treated us like regular people when we were kids. So I lucked out. KF: Did your parents help you survive child stardom? NPH: They were definitely grounding forces during years in my life that were very tumultuous. They're remarkably grounded and were not at all blinded by the light of stardom and fame. Their main concern was just my well-being and my brother's well-being during all of our crazy times, whether they be intimate or very public. They're remarkable people.

"Beijing, China (CNN)  -- In some of the photos, the young children are wearing bibs and slight smiles can be seen on their chubby faces. But these are not your normal baby pictures. The Chinese government is trying to find the parents of these 60 homeless children, some of them so young that they had not yet developed the strength to hold their own heads up. This week the Chinese Ministry of Public Security posted pictures of these rescued children on its Web site. Many of them had similar stories. They were kidnapped, stolen or sold and somehow had been rescued by authorities. Police tried to find their parents but could not find them through the national DNA database, state-run China Daily reported. And for the first time, the Ministry of Public Security posted their pictures. ""Even if I can't find my boy's photo on the Web site today, it's a blessing for desperate parents like us who have nearly lost hope,"" Tang Weihua, a mother who lost her 5-year-old son in 1999, told China Daily this week. About 30,000 to 60,000 children are reported missing every year, but it is hard to estimate how many are involved in child trafficking cases, the Ministry of Public Security told China Daily. Police have rescued 2,000 children this year since China launch a nationwide anti-trafficking campaign, China Daily reported. But after rescuing the children finding the parents can prove difficult. One issue is that in some cases the parents sold the children. Earlier this week China's state media reported that police arrested dozens in an alleged child trafficking ring that sold at least 52 babies. The traffickers bought 19 boys and 33 girls from impoverished rural families in Shanxi and Hebei provinces in the past two years, the state-run Xinhua news agency said. The ring started crumbling after three men were arrested with a baby boy in their van, Xinhua said. The three suspects said they had bought the baby from a woman and her daughter in Hebei, according to Xinhua. The women had sold 12 other babies to the men, and were arrested, Xinhua said.","China posts photos of kidnapped, stolen or sold 60 children who were rescued by authorities .

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea bade farewell to former President Kim Dae-Jung Sunday in a ceremony attended by thousands of citizens, dignitaries and politicians. South Korean Buddhist monks pray in front of a portrait of former  president Kim Dae-jung during his funeral Sunday. The solemn Sunday afternoon ceremony was held outside parliament, with a large portrait of Kim placed on a shrine surrounded by flowers. The funeral followed six days of mourning for Kim, who died Tuesday of a heart failure. Kim's age at the time of his death was in dispute, with some reports saying he was 85 while others placing it at 83. Kim's state funeral was the second such ever given in the country, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said. Another president, Park Chung-hee, was also accorded a state funeral after his assassination while in office in 1979. Kim -- who was president from 1998 to 2003 -- won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for trying to foster better relations with North Korea. The watershed moment of his presidency came in June 2000 when he met North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, becoming the first South Korean leader to do so since the Korean War unofficially ended in 1953. But rapproachment talks between the two sides hit a wall after conservative South Korean President Lee Myung-bak took office in early 2008 with a tougher stance toward the North than Kim and his successor, Roh Moo-hyun. Ahead of the funeral, President Lee met with a visiting North Korean delegation, who delivered a message from Kim Jong Il expressing hopes for improved relations between the two countries. Lee, in turn, reiterated his government's firm stance, presidential spokesman Lee Dong-kwan was quoted as saying by Yonhap. But in a possible sign that icy relations between the two rival nations are nevertheless thawing, South Korean Unification Minister Hyun In Taek met with North Korean unity leader Kim Yang Gon on Saturday. It was the first high-level, cross-border contact in nearly two years. The meetings between officials of the two Koreas are in stark contrast to the tense public statements they made about each other earlier this year. Tensions between the two were heightened in July when North Korea launched seven short-range missiles toward the Sea of Japan. The launches came after North Korea conducted a nuclear test on May 25 and threatened the United States and South Korean ships near its territorial waters. South Korea condemned the action, calling the launches ""provocative"" and ""unwise."" CNN's Jake Perez contributed to this report.","South Korea bade farewell to former President Kim Dae-Jung .

"Editor's note: Gloria Borger is a senior political analyst for CNN, appearing regularly on CNN's ""The Situation Room,"" ""Campbell Brown,"" ""AC360°"" and ""State of the Union With John King"" as well as other programs during special event coverage. Gloria Borger says President Obama's plans are running into Americans' widespread mistrust of government. (CNN) -- So now comes the hard part. Now that a key Senate committee has finally moved a health care bill, President Obama can get to work to try and figure out a final version of reform. Now that Gen. Stanley McChrystal has recommended a large troop buildup in Afghanistan -- setting off an internal debate about recalibrating strategy -- the president can decide what he wants to do about the war. And now that the stock market is on the rebound -- while unemployment remains high -- Obama can figure out how to come up with a ""son of stimulus"" package that targets jobs. Tough decisions are part of the president's job description, after all. But here's the tricky part: how to convince the public that you -- and government -- will do the right thing, or are even capable of it. Sure, distrust of government is as old as government itself. And there's an inherent conflict in current public thinking, as scholars William Galston and Elaine Kamarck point out: While people want government to solve big problems like health care, they don't trust the government to do it. ""There is nothing new about this ambivalence,"" they write in an essay aptly titled ""Change you can believe in requires a government you can trust."" They write, ""But how ... the president deals with it may make the difference between success and failure."" So what's a president with a big agenda to do? He could have narrowed it, but instead decided to play ""all-in."" Because he was so popular, and because voters were so ready for a change, there was some thought the country might buy into the notion that good leadership could actually change the ethos of bad government. Obama probably believed it, too. So when the economic stimulus package was hatched, with hardly a Republican vote, the White House remained hopeful that, in the end, its success would restore confidence in their work. And they have since toiled mightily to brag about the stimulus package as evidence that government can work. After all, if FDR could do it, why not Barack Obama? Instead, the stimulus has become a handy target. Wall Street may be doing well, both conservatives and liberals rail, but the jobs elsewhere are not coming back. And as the president now moves to ask the nation to support an overhaul of health care, voters are still asking: Why should we trust the government to do that? Consider these numbers: At the end of the Bush administration -- with an unpopular president -- just 17 percent of the American public trusted the government to ""do the right thing"" all or most of the time. And for all of the popularity of Barack Obama, that number now stands at a measly 23 percent. After Bill Clinton lost health care reform -- and control of the Congress -- trust in government in 1994 was at an all-time low: 21 percent. We're almost there now. Ronald Reagan understood, and used to his benefit, the antipathy toward government. He used to joke that the scariest words in the lexicon were ""I'm from the government and I'm here to help."" He wanted to make government smaller, and his overall success with that notion prompted President Clinton to famously tell Congress ""the era of big government is over."" Well, it's back. The question is whether President Obama can convince us that more government is what we want -- and need. As Reagan once told us, ""Trust, but verify."" If only we could. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gloria Borger.","Borger: Now the heat is on Obama to make crucial decisions .

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Even before one reaches the front door of Canon's headquarters in Tokyo, one can sense the virtual stampede of employees pouring out of the building exactly at 5:30 p.m. Japan's birth rate of 1.34 is below the level needed to maintain the country's population. In a country where 12-hour workdays are common, the electronics giant has taken to letting its employees leave early twice a week for a rather unusual reason: to encourage them to have more babies. Japan is in the midst of an unprecedented recession, so corporations are being asked to work toward fixing another major problem: the country's low birthrate. Tell us what you think . At 1.34, the birthrate is well below the 2.0 needed to maintain Japan's population, according to the country's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Keidanren, Japan's largest business group, with 1,300 major international corporations as members, has issued a plea to its members to let workers go home early to spend time with their families and help Japan with its pressing social problem. Watch more on this story . One reason for the low birth rate is the 12-hour workday. But there are several other factors compounding the problem -- among them, the high cost of living, and social rigidity toward women and parenting. In addition, Japan's population is aging at a faster pace than any other country in the world. Analysts say the world's second-largest economy faces its greatest threat from its own social problems, rather than outside forces. And the country desperately needs to make some fixes to its current social and work structures, sociologists say. The 5:30 p.m. lights-out program is one simple step toward helping address the population problem. It also has an added benefit: Amid the global economic downturn the company can slash overtime across the board twice a week. ""It's great that we can go home early and not feel ashamed,"" said employee Miwa Iwasaki.","Japanese electronics maker Canon encourages workers to have more babies .

"(CNN)  -- A Utah man trapped for more than 26 hours in a crevice of a popular cave tourist attraction died as rescuers struggled to save him, authorities said Thursday. John Edward Jones, 26, of Stansbury Park was stuck in the Nutty Putty Cave, which sits west of Utah Lake near Cedar Valley, according to the sheriff's office of Utah County. The cave is 55 to 60 miles south of Salt Lake City. Sheriff's officials said Jones entered the cave at around 6 p.m. Tuesday with a group of about 11 people and became stuck about 8:45 p.m. in a ""tightly confined"" feature inside Nutty Putty Cave called ""Bob's Push."" Utah County sheriff's spokesman Sgt. Spencer Cannon told CNN affiliate KSL that Jones was trapped upside down in a crevice that was about 18 inches wide and about 10 inches high. The crevice is about 150 feet below the surface and about 700 feet from the cave entrance, according to the sheriff's department. ""They had him to a level spot where he wasn't heading downhill with his head below his feet,"" Cannon said. ""During the course of that, they have a raising system to hold him in position, and one of the devices of that system failed, and Mr. Jones actually fell back to the area where he had been stuck for so long."" Shortly before midnight on Wednesday, rescuers got close enough to Jones to conclude that he was not breathing and he had no pulse. Rescue officials were meeting Thursday to determine how to recover Jones' body. Rescuers had tried to reach Jones for more than 24 hours, but had problems navigating the treacherous terrain, Cannon said. ""Getting people to him is very difficult,"" Cannon told KSL before Jones died. ""It is a tightly confined space. When there is movement, it is literally millimeters at a time."" There are narrow areas of the cave where visitors have to crawl on their bellies to get through, according to the attraction's Web site. Up to 5,000 people visit each year, the site said.","John Edward Jones was stuck in cave crevice outside Salt Lake City .

"Santiago, Chile (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived Tuesday morning in Chile, bringing with her more than two dozen satellite phones and a pledge of U.S. commitment to the earthquake-damaged nation. ""The United States is ready to respond to the requests that the government of Chile has made so we can provide not only solidarity but specific supplies that are needed to help you recover from the earthquake,"" Clinton said at a brief news conference with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet. ""The people of Chile are responding with resilience and strength,"" Clinton said. The secretary of state said she brought with her 25 satellite phones, one of which she presented to Bachelet at the news conference. Eight water purification units are on their way to Chile, Clinton said, and the United States will provide a mobile field hospital unit with surgical capabilities. The United States will also work to provide autonomous dialysis machines, electricity generators, medical supplies and portable bridges, Clinton said. The secretary of state also said that Americans would be told how they can contribute to the recovery effort. In addition to meeting with Bachelet at the airport in Santiago, Clinton also met with President-elect Sebastian Piñera, who will be sworn in next week. ""I have been visiting sites of disaster for more than 30 years ... [and] it is very clear to me that Chile is much better prepared, much quicker to respond, more able to do so,"" Clinton said at a news conference with the president-elect. She congratulated Piñera, a conservative billionaire businessman, on his inauguration. Piñera extended an invitation to President Obama to visit Chile. Bachelet leaves office with high approval ratings for having steered the country through the global economic downturn and promoted progressive social reforms. Clinton is in the midst of a six-nation tour of Latin America, planned before the earthquake. She attended Monday's inauguration in Uruguay of President Jose Mujica, and then traveled to Buenos Aires, Argentina, to meet with President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. Clinton next travels to Brazil, where she is expected to talk with President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva about his planned trip to Iran. The United States and other nations believe Iran has undertaken a program to build nuclear weapons, an assertion Iran denies. She will stop in Costa Rica for meetings with President Oscar Arias and President-elect Laura Chinchilla, who takes office in May. She also will attend Pathways for Prosperity, a meeting of hemispheric officials. The initiative includes such things as ""microcredit"" loans and ways in which women can be empowered, a State Department spokesman has said. Clinton's final stop will be Guatemala. She will meet with Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom and leaders of other Central American countries and the Dominican Republic before returning to Washington. The State Department has ""strongly"" urged U.S. citizens to avoid tourism and non-essential travel to Chile after the massive earthquake.","Hillary Clinton brings satellite phones on visit to Chile, promises mobile field hospital .

"Cusco, Peru (CNN) -- Authorities in Peru have rescued the last of hundreds of travelers who had been stranded by flooding in a town near one of South America's most popular tourist destinations, a government official said Friday. Tourism Minister Martin Perez said 1,460 tourists were evacuated from Aguas Calientes, bringing the total rescued during the past three days to 4,005 -- 3,500 of them tourists. Thirteen helicopters in 268 flights took them to the city of Cusco, though one group of Colombians indicated they had not wanted to leave, he said. Days of heavy rain had triggered flash floods and landslides around Machu Picchu, the ruins of an Incan settlement in southern Peru's Andes Mountains. The floods closed roads, bridges and rail lines, stranding tourists from around the world in the small town closest to the ruins. They also killed at least seven people, including an Argentine tourist, according to news reports. The tourists became stranded after a landslide early in the week blocked a rail line to Cusco, the nearest major city, said Martin Perez, Peru's minister of foreign trade and tourism, according to the state-run Andina news agency. Peruvian authorities said they have given priority to children, the elderly and the ill, regardless of their nationality. Authorities estimated that 10,000 people were affected by the rain and 2,000 homes were ruined in and around Machu Picchu. The Peruvian government declared a state of emergency in two regions around Machu Picchu -- Cusco and Apurimac. The floods have damaged thousands of acres of crop land, washed out about a dozen bridges and damaged several highways. Don Jacinto, whose parents and grandparents lived in one affected area, said his relatives could not recall the rivers ever raging so strongly. Machu Picchu is an ancient city on a mountain in the Andes, standing 8,000 feet (2,430 meters) above sea level in a tropical mountain forest. Known as the ""Lost City of the Incas,"" Machu Picchu attracts tens of thousands of international tourists every year.

"(CNN) -- After being photographed using an inhaler prior to extra-time in his MLS Cup Final, the news that David Beckham has been an asthma sufferer since childhood has propelled the condition into the limelight. The England midfielder is not the first high-profile athlete to have dealt with asthma, a respiratory condition that affects people's airways -- the small tubes that carry air in and out of the lungs. Despite the difficulties of performing with asthmatic symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath and coughing, many athletes have dealt still managed to reach the peak of their respective disciplines. Read up on asthma in our health section A-Z. NBA star Dennis Rodman, footballer Frank Lampard and Olympic swimmers Nancy Hogsehead and Mark Spitz have all suffered from the condition, here are five more of sport's most high-profile asthmatics. 1. Paul Scholes . Beckham's ex-Manchester United teammate Paul Scholes was diagnosed with asthma when he was 21-years-old. One of England's most well respected midfielders, despite keeping a low-profile in general Scholes has always been happy to raise awareness about asthma. In May 2009 he along with fellow English midfielder and asthma sufferer Frank Lampard took part in Asthma UK's campaign to ""put asthma in the limelight."" 2. Justine Henin . Prior to announcing her (temporary) retirement in May 2008, Belgian tennis player Justine Henin had suggested she may have had to pull out of defending her gold medal at the Beijing Olympics because of worries the city's pollution would trigger her asthma. The grand slam winner had already withdrew from the China Open in September 2007 because of her condition. 3. Jerome Bettis . NFL running back Jerome Bettis was diagnosed with asthma during a high-school football session and in 1997 suffered an attack triggered by the extreme heat in Florida. It did not stop the man nicknamed 'The Bus' and he went on to win the Superbowl with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Bettis has been heavily involved with raising asthma awareness in America. 4. Paula Radcliffe . English long-distance runner Paula Radcliffe was diagnosed with exercise-induced asthma as a result of her training when she was a teenager. Despite this she has become one of the most successful marathon runners of recent years, winning both the New York and London marathons among other events. 5. Jackie Joyner-Kersee . American track and field legend Jackie Joyner-Kersee discovered she was asthmatic in 1983 after finding she couldn't catch her breath after periods of exercise. Failing to take her medication properly she suffered a life threatening asthma attack at one point. Eventually getting it under control, Joyner-Kersee went onto win three Olympic gold medals at the 1988 and 1992 games in heptathlon and long jump.","David Beckham was pictured taking his asthma inhaler during LA Galaxy's MLS Cup loss to Real Salt Lake .

"HAVANA, Cuba (CNN)  -- New Orleans, Louisiana, Mayor Ray Nagin arrived in Cuba late Friday on a mission to learn about how to deal with storms, a spokeswoman said. Mayor Ray Nagin watches President Obama speak in New Orleans, Louisiana, on Thursday. ""We understand we may have a lot to learn from the Cubans in terms of disaster preparedness and how they have dealt with hurricanes,"" spokeswoman Ceeon Quiett said. Cuba is internationally applauded for exceptional disaster management, according to a news release from Nagin's office. In the Cuban capital, Havana, Nagin plans to meet with several officials, including some from the Latin American Medical Centers for Disaster. He will also learn about preparations the Cuba Defense Committee makes in advance of disasters. Nagin's trip comes a day after President Obama held a town hall meeting in New Orleans, still reeling from the aftermath of deadly Hurricane Katrina in 2005. ""It has now been just over four years since that terrible storm struck your shores,"" the president said. ""And [in] the days after it did, this nation and all the world bore witness to the fact that the damage from Katrina was not caused just by a disaster of nature but also by a breakdown of government, that government wasn't adequately prepared, and we didn't appropriately respond."" Since Katrina, New Orleans has adjusted its disaster response with new evacuation plans. As Hurricane Gustav threatened the city last year, officials evacuated more than 18,000 residents, the release said. Three powerful hurricanes hit Cuba last year, damaging half a million homes and causing $10 billion in losses, according to the Cuban government. But only seven people died, thanks to a smooth evacuation plan. Some aspects of the communist nation's response, including mandatory evacuations, may not be possible in a democracy. Still, some Americans believe that they can learn from their Caribbean neighbor. The mayor of Galveston, Texas, another city hit hard by Gulf of Mexico hurricanes, visited Cuba this year. Nagin is the first New Orleans mayor to make an official visit to Cuba in 50 years. The State Department sanctioned Nagin's trip, Quiett said. He plans to return to New Orleans on Thursday.

"(CNN) -- Ramping up pressure on Honduras' interim government, the United States has revoked the visa of the beleaguered country's leader, a senior Honduran official told CNN en Espanol on Saturday. Roberto Micheletti and his supporters say Honduras underwent a constitutional transfer of power, not a coup. De facto President Roberto Micheletti and 14 supreme court judges had their visas revoked, said Honduran Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez. Lopez said he, too, lost his visa privileges. The U.S. State Department recently announced that it would pull the visas of members of Honduras' de facto regime. In recent weeks, the United States has stepped up its call for the current Honduran government to restore ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya to power. Zelaya was seized by the Honduran military in his pajamas and sent into exile on June 28. On Wednesday, the board of the Millennium Challenge Corporation, a U.S. government agency, voted to cut $11 million in aid to the government in Honduras, senior State Department officials told CNN. Prior to the vote, the board had only suspended the aid, the State Department said. The Millennium Challenge Account is a program started under the Bush administration to reward good governance. The agency's cuts followed an announcement last week by the United States that it was terminating all nonhumanitarian aid to Honduras to pressure the interim government to end the political turmoil and accept the terms of an agreement known as the San Jose Accord. The accord calls for Zelaya's return to power. The political crisis stemmed from Zelaya's plan to hold a referendum that could have changed the constitution and allowed longer term limits. The country's congress had outlawed the vote and the supreme court had ruled it illegal. Micheletti and his supporters say that Zelaya's removal was a constitutional transfer of power and not a coup. The United Nations has condemned Zelaya's ouster and does not recognize Michiletti's government. While the United States has called Zelaya's ouster a coup, it has not formally designated it a ""military coup,"" which, under U.S. law, would have triggered a cutoff of all non-humanitarian aid regardless. Senior State Department officials said the Obama administration was reluctant to make the formal designation in order to preserve its flexibility for a diplomatic solution. A presidential campaign in Honduras kicked off last week. However, the United States said it would not support the outcome of the elections unless Zelaya was restored to power.

"(CNN) -- Fighting in the volatile Sudanese region of Darfur has sparked another wave of refugees into Chad and left a Red Cross employee dead, according to international agencies. Refugee camps in eastern Chad house about 300,000 people who fled violence in the Darfur region of Sudan. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said on Monday that more than 12,000 people have fled militia attacks over the last few days from Sudan's Darfur region to neighboring Chad, still recovering from a recent attempt by rebels there to topple the government. ""Most of the new arrivals in Chad had already been displaced in Darfur in recent years. They are really tired of being attacked and having to move,"" said UNHCR's Jorge Holly. ""All the new refugees we talked to said they did not want to go back to Darfur at this point, they wanted to be transferred to a refugee camp in eastern Chad."" This latest influx of refugees in Chad aggravates an already deteriorating security situation across this politically unstable region of Africa. Before the latest flight into Chad, the UNHCR and its partner groups ""were taking care of 240,000 Sudanese refugees in 12 camps in eastern Chad and some 50,000 from Central African Republic in the south of the country."" Up to 30,000 people in Chad fled the country for Cameroon during the rebel-government fighting. The International Committee of the Red Cross said on Monday that one of its employees was killed in western Darfur last week during fighting. The victim is a 45-year-old Sudanese national and father of six children. He was killed in the area of Seleia, one of the three towns where reported government-backed Janjaweed militia attacks on Friday left around 200 people dead. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon last week deplored the acts, urged all parties to stop hostilities, and said ""all parties must adhere to international humanitarian law, which prohibits military attacks against civilians."" The United Nations says ""more than 200,000 people have been killed and 2.2 million others forced to flee their homes since fighting began in 2003 among government forces, rebel groups and allied militia groups known as the Janjaweed.""

"JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Israel of Germany's ""Holocaust shame,"" and asserted its support for the Jewish state during an unprecedented speech to the Knesset on Tuesday. Germany and Israel are linked ""in a very special way"" by the memory of the Holocaust, in which 6 million Jews were killed under Nazi Germany and its allies in World War II, she said in the first address a German chancellor has ever made to the Knesset. ""The Holocaust fills us with shame,"" she said. ""I bow my head before the survivors and I bow my head before you in tribute to the fact that you were able to survive."" Anti-Semitism, racism and xenophobia ""must never take root again in Germany or in Europe,"" she said, and vowed to battle any flare-ups. Speaking to the Knesset, Angela Merkel also spoke of Germany's unwavering support for Israel calling the Iranian president's nuclear ambitions ""a major danger"" not only to Israel, but to the world as well. The German Chancellor called on him to prove that he does not want a nuclear bomb. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said his country's nuclear program is intended for peaceful purposes only, but Merkel told the Israeli parliament that he needs to provide clear evidence supporting that assertion. ""It is not the world that has to prove that Iran is building a bomb,"" she said. ""Rather, Iran has to prove to the world that it does not want the nuclear bomb."" Ahmadinejad has also said Israel should not exist as a sovereign nation, but Merkel said Israel's right to exist is not open to negotiation. ""These are not just empty words,"" she said, adding that Germany would support further sanctions on Iran if it fails to cooperate. ""What do we do when a majority says the greatest threat to the world comes from Israel and not from Iran?"" she asked. ""Do we bow our heads? Do we give up our efforts to combat the Iranian threat? However inconvenient and uncomfortable the alternative is, we do not do that."" ""If we were to do that, then we would not have understood our historical responsibility, nor would we be able to properly develop a way to deal with the challenges of our day, and both options would be lethal.""

Merkel said she supports the two-state solution to the Mideast conflict, discussed last November by the key parties in Annapolis, Maryland.

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- The U.S. price tag for relief in Haiti has hit $170 million, the federal government announced Thursday as ton after ton of relief supplies headed into the island nation through a crucial reopened pier. The vast majority of the committed federal aid -- $140 million -- is from the U.S. Agency for International Development under the State Department, according to the Office of Management and Budget. And the need within Haiti -- still reeling from last week's devastating 7.0-magnitude earthquake -- only grows by the minute. After days of being closed to much needed food and supplies, the south pier at Port-au-Prince was channeling aid into the leveled capital city. The supplies were brought into Port-au-Prince on trucks traveling on a repaired gravel road leading from the port. Sidewalks were crowded with street vendors and kiosks and many small food stores were open. Dozens of stalls at a dusty market sold fruits and vegetables along a pocked and rut-filled dirt side street. A smaller market on a street corner saw some business. However, the longest and most visible lines in Haiti's capital were not for food, water or gas -- they were for money. Earthquake survivors need cash and are waiting hours outside wire transfer businesses, including Western Union, that are starting to reopen. ""I have not eaten for two days,"" said 32-year-old Anderson Bellegarde, who waited more than six hours outside a money-wiring branch. ""I'm only drinking water."" Meanwhile, a Dutch Navy ship, the Pelikaan, was docked at the city's south pier Thursday, unloading 90 tons of humanitarian aid. Two other ships had previously offloaded containers. The reopened pier is older and smaller than the north pier, which was rendered unusable by the January 12 earthquake. The south pier was damaged, but Haiti port authorities and the U.S. military were able to put it back in adequate shape. Workers also repaired the road leading into the city and laid gravel on it. Unloading of aid, however, was a slow process. The road allows only for one-way traffic, meaning a truck drives to the end of the pier, is loaded with supplies, and then drives out. Also, because of concerns about overloading the pier, only one truck is allowed on it at a time. Repairs on the pier continue, said U.S. Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Mark Gibbs. ""We're working on it. We've got a long ways to go. ... If we lose this pier, that's it. We can't bring in anything."" However, the reopening of the pier and the repairing of the road represented a major development in efforts to get aid to earthquake victims, in that ships can carry much more cargo than air airplanes. Authorities hope to get two-way traffic going on the pier by Friday, which would speed up the process. A 5.9-magnitude aftershock Wednesday stopped efforts at the pier for about three hours. U.S. Navy divers had to go back in the water and reassess the pier's structural integrity, officials said. There was no immediate word if two less intense aftershocks Thursday, measured at magnitude 4.9 and 4.8, also caused a delay. Full coverage  |  Twitter updates . Lt. Gen. Douglas Fraser of U.S. Southern Command announced the pier's reopening on Thursday in Washington. Officials hope to move about 150 containers of aid Thursday and 250 on Friday. They want to increase that to 800 containers a day. The reopening comes as U.S. officials have been stung by criticism of aid efforts in recent days. Some of that criticism has been leveled by aid groups such as Doctors Without Borders, who blamed five victims' deaths on delays, saying several flights carrying medical supplies had been diverted from the Port-au-Prince airport into the neighboring Dominican Republic. Working under adverse conditions with limited supplies, medical teams have been forced to improvise. List of missing, found in Haiti | Are you there? | Impact Your World . Renzo Fricke, field coordinator for Doctors Without Borders told CNN this week that staffers had to buy a saw in the market so surgeons could do amputations. A CNN crew loaned a medic a pocket knife for another operation. Lacking rubbing alcohol, doctors have used vodka to sterilize equipment and instruments. Surgical patients are being given over-the-counter pain medicine because doctors lack any stronger medication. One nurse used a string of Christmas lights as a makeshift extension cord. A belt was used as a tourniquet, and when that broke, a garden hose. Canadian troops, meanwhile, were working to open an airport in Jacmel on Thursday, another step that could speed delivery of relief supplies. And U.S. Southern Command, through its component Air Force South, conducted an air drop of food and water over Mirebalais, Haiti, on Thursday. Mirebalais is 25 miles northeast of Port-au-Prince. A C-17 delivered water bottles and 17,200 meals ready to eat, the military said in a statement. Troops secured an area in which to drop the supplies and, once the supplies were on the ground, the military, the U.S. Agency for International Development and other personnel distributed them, the statement said. Nepalese troops also assisted, the Air Force said. Thursday's air drop was the second since the quake; the first was Monday. Fraser said Thursday that 120 to 140 flights a day are coming into the single-runway Port-au-Prince airport, compared with 25 per day just after the quake struck last week. More than 840 have landed since the airport was reopened, but there is a waiting list of 1,400 to come in, he said.  A senior administration official acknowledged that not all aid, particularly medical supplies, is getting through fast enough but said that in recent days, at least half of the flights entering Haiti are carrying humanitarian supplies. Most of the other 50 percent of flights, including those of the U.S. military and foreign governments, are still carrying some kind of aid.  ""Of course I'm not satisfied with getting material and personnel in for everyone who needs it,"" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said earlier Wednesday. ""Realistically, I am aware of the difficulties that this terrible natural disaster has posed."" The senior administration official said that more than 300 aid distribution sites are up and running. Fraser said more than 700,000 meals and 1.4 million bottles of water have been delivered, along with 22,000 pounds of medical supplies. About 13,100 U.S. troops are in and around Haiti, nearly 2,700 on the ground and another 10,400 off shore. Many Marines spend time in Haiti during the day but sleep on ships at night. More U.S. troops are scheduled to arrive by this weekend, bringing the total to about 4,600 troops on the ground. At least 72,000 people -- including dozens of U.N. staff members -- have been confirmed dead in the earthquake, according to the country's prime minister. International aid contributions have totaled hundreds of millions of dollars, but relief agencies working in Haiti say transportation bottlenecks and poor communications have slowed the delivery of food, water and medicine to survivors. On Wednesday, U.S. Agency for International Development administrator Rajiv Shah ordered more medicine and other supplies to be sent within the next 24 hours, the administration official said. Lt. Gen. P.K. Keen, the head of the U.S. military task force in Haiti, said any aircraft identified as carrying medical supplies would have priority for landing. They are turned away only ""if there's no parking space on the ramp, and they don't have sufficient fuel to hold in their holding pattern,"" he said. Another senior U.S. military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday that the priorities for aid flights are set ""by the government of Haiti first and then by the U.N. second."" But the number of flights that can land at Port-au-Prince is ""a sheer issue of physics and geometry; you just can't get them all in there."" To improve the flow of air traffic, the U.S. military said Wednesday it had obtained landing rights at the Dominican Republic's air base at San Isidro, about 135 miles (220 kilometers) east of Port-au-Prince. The U.S. military has the ability to build dirt runways that rugged cargo planes such as the C-130 Hercules can use, but the equipment needed to build those is ""always at a premium,"" the senior official said. The military has 63 helicopters in the region, Fraser said. CNN's Arthur Brice, Susan Candiotti, Jill Dougherty, Eric Marrapodi and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","New route allows supplies to enter Port-au-Prince .

"Editor's note: Ed Rollins, a senior political contributor for CNN, is senior presidential fellow at the Kalikow Center for the Study of the American Presidency at Hofstra University. He was White House political director for President Reagan and chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. Ed Rollins says ""Saturday Night Live"" satire has shaped images of presidents for the worse. NEW YORK (CNN) -- Since its debut on October 11, 1975, ""Saturday Night Live"" has spoofed, ridiculed and hammered presidents and other political figures without regard to political affiliation or any other sensitivities. The perfect parroting of Sarah Palin after her vice president nomination, by the immensely talented Tina Fey, started the downward spiraling of the governor. People started looking at her in a different light, and she was judged as a less serious candidate. Saturday's skit portraying President Obama as a man who made a lot of promises and hasn't been able to fulfill many -- if any -- has been analyzed over and over with a constant rerun of the ""SNL"" clip. In the comedy skit, the president is asked about unrealized campaign promises, including closing Gitmo, combating global warming, allowing openly gay people to serve in the military, withdrawing from Iraq, improving the status of the fight in Afghanistan, reforming health care and several others. On screen the response on a check list was: that each item was ""not done.""  Humor with some truth in it is always dangerous. Make no mistake, a drumbeat of belittlement can damage a president.  See how 'SNL' has portrayed presidents »  President Gerald Ford, a gifted athlete, could never overcome the image of a bumbling, clumsy man who banged his head constantly after the hilarious portrayal of him by Chevy Chase. The senior Bush, George H.W., was brilliantly played by Dana Carvey, and more viewers remember our 41st president as the goofy, inarticulate caricature than as a serious man who served his country in many positions. But the real question being debated on cable TV because of the ""SNL"" parody is this: ""Has the media's love affair and honeymoon with President Obama ended?"" I can't answer that. I can say that President Obama is being judged with the same scrutiny as those who have gone before him in the modern era. Sooner or later, all honeymoons for presidents come to an end. This one may have lasted a little longer because many in the media got caught up in the story, in the history and wrote with their emotions instead of their computers. In the few months President Obama has been in office, the following questions are being asked across the country by some Americans and the media, too: ""Is he as good as we all hoped? Can he possibly meet the extraordinary high expectations that were set for him? Can he get the job done? Could anyone?"" Democrats will add pensively to the words: ""Not Done"" from the ""SNL"" skit, ""Not yet."" Republicans would add assertively : ""Not ever!"" Democrats are still hopeful this president will turn out to be the ""Camelot II""; the new generational leader for whom they have waited decades and in some cases lifetimes. Many hope President Obama will be the new John Fitzgerald Kennedy -- with the legislative skills of Lyndon Baines Johnson. Republicans have no hope left about Obama. At best, they pray, for the good of the country that he's not as bad as Jimmy Carter. But in reality, they see the man who campaigned as a centrist turning out to be the feared liberal who voted that way during his short Senate tenure. At a time of fiscal crisis, President Obama in their minds is turning into the biggest spender and taxer in history -- and they believe they must oppose him. His campaign was brilliant, and he won against two inferior campaigns, though not necessarily inferior candidates. Both of those candidates are making major contributions to the governing process. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is getting high marks and certainly has been a loyal supporter of the president. John McCain has renewed his Senate career with intensity and has become a valuable asset to the loyal opposition. Every president finds out that campaigning and governing are not the same thing. Governing is tough every day. Campaigning can be fun. It's why some modern presidents want to keep doing it even after being elected. Reagan did it. Bill Clinton did it. George W. Bush did it. And this president likes to do it, and I am sure will continue to ride Air Force One from speech to speech, coast to coast. Giving a good speech or making a great appearance on the campaign trail to adoring crowds is not the same as making the tough choices that President Obama needs to make every day alone in his Oval Office. No cheering there. Often in campaigns, promises are made that can't be kept once in office. After being elected, presidents find out the issues are more difficult the more they get to know about them. Sometimes voters don't remember campaign promises and sometimes they don't care. The ""Saturday Night Live"" skit left out one promise President Obama made and it wasn't a campaign promise. It was the promise that his $787 billion stimulus package would create 3.5 million new jobs. If ""SNL"" had asked the question, the answer would be: Not Done! The job hasn't even been started. The United States is losing more jobs by the minute. Before we turn this economy around, job loss could reach 9 million in the past two years and unemployment could reach 10.5 percent. This didn't happen all on his watch and a big chunk of the stimulus is not yet spent. But if we don't get Americans back to work, the other promises President Obama made will pale in importance. Focus on jobs, Mr. President. The highest unemployment rate in 25 years is about real Americans all across this country who are hurting and depressed. That's a topic that's even ""Saturday Night Live"" can't joke about, because it's tragic. All Americans want to see this president succeed in getting that job done. iReport.com: 'SNL' won't hurt Obama . The president has made a lot of promises regarding health care reform, even though the final details of the bills are not known. Promises made as president do count;, far more than those as a candidate. And the president will be measured against them. He will be judged not in a skit on ""Saturday Night Live"" but by his fellow citizens at the voting booth. And it will be no laughing matter if they feel he misled them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Rollins.","Ed Rollins: ""Saturday Night Live"" highlighted unfulfilled Obama promises .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The U.S. State Department has sold its London embassy building to a Qatari real estate company, the embassy announced Tuesday. The signing of the deal is another major step in the embassy's plans to relocate from its longtime headquarters in central London to a new site in Wandsworth, on the south bank of the River Thames. It wasn't immediately clear how much Qatari Diar Real Estate paid for the embassy building in Grosvenor Square, whose 1960s facade was recently given listed status, meaning its design can't be changed. The embassy will continue to operate from the current building until the new one is completed in 2016 or 2017, the embassy said. Construction is expected to begin in 2012 or 2013. It was a year ago that the embassy announced it was looking for a new site that is more modern, open, and secure than the current building in London's West End. It has now settled on a site in Wandsworth and is having a design competition for the new building. When the embassy does move to Wandsworth, it will mark the end of a more than 200-year association with Grosvenor Square, in the historic and exclusive neighborhood of Mayfair near Hyde Park. John Adams, who later became U.S. president, lived on the square from 1785 to 1788, when he was the first U.S. minister to the Court of St. James. The building in which he lived still stands in the square's northeast corner. The embassy moved to various locations in the West End before returning to Grosvenor Square in 1938. For years, it occupied a building on the east side of the square -- a building that now houses the Canadian High Commission. During World War II, the square was known as ""Little America"" because the embassy was on one side and Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower's headquarters were on the other. The embassy moved to its current site, occupying the entire west side of the square, when the building was completed in 1960. The concrete, four-story structure was designed by Eero Saarinen, who also designed the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri, and the U.S. Air Force Academy Chapel in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Since the September 11 attacks in 2001, the embassy has caused controversy locally by installing blast walls in a wide perimeter around the building. Neighbors complained the walls were unsightly, and the walls caused the road in front of the building to be closed to traffic. Sitting atop the building at the front is a huge gilded aluminum eagle with a 35-foot wingspan. It is not clear whether the eagle will be considered part of the building's listed status, meaning it will have to stay on the facade, or whether it can be moved to the new location, according to a spokesman for the realty firm Cushman and Wakefield, which advised the United States on the sale.","Qatari firm buys landmark U.S. Embassy building in Grosvenor Square .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN)   -- The sudden end to a legal battle between dethroned Miss California USA Carrie Prejean and pageant officials was prompted by the revelation of a ""sex tape,"" according to a source familiar with the lawsuits' settlement. Prejean was fired in June after lingerie-modeling photos of her emerged that pageant officials said were a breach of her contract. Prejean sued the pageant in August, arguing her firing was religious discrimination because of her opposition to same-sex marriage. Pageant officials countersued last month, demanding their former beauty queen repay $5,200 in pageant money spent for her breast implants and give them all proceeds from a book she's written. A settlement of both lawsuits was signed in New York Tuesday, but no details were made public. Lawyers and parties for each side were bound by a confidentiality pledge, according to the source. The veil of secrecy was partially lifted Wednesday after celebrity gossip Web site TMZ reported the deal was sealed after pageant lawyers presented an ""extremely graphic"" home video involving Prejean. TMZ Managing Editor Harvey Levin said during a webcast Wednesday that he obtained the Prejean video during the summer, but found it ""too racy"" to post on his site. He indicated Prejean was alone in the video. The source with knowledge of the settlement talks told CNN those details were accurate. Prejean's lawyer, Charles LiMandri, responded with a short statement issued through an employee at his law office. ""It's a confidential settlement, and he can't discuss it,"" the statement said. Several calls and e-mail to Prejean's publicist were not returned Wednesday. Prejean's tell-all book hits bookstores next week, and she is scheduled for media interviews to promote it. Pageant spokesman Kenn Henman said Tuesday the settlement means all lawsuit demands are dropped. The pageant had claimed that the contract she signed when she entered their competition last year gave the pageant the rights to anything she wrote. The settlement ended that claim. Pageant officials also dropped their attempt to be repaid for her breast enhancement, which was done before she represented California in the Miss USA competition, according to Henman. Prejean, in exchange, withdrew her suit accusing the pageant of violating her privacy by confirming to reporters that her breasts were enhanced, Henman said. ""We are moving forward from the past and looking towards the crowning of two winners and the new look of the upcoming Miss California USA pageant, telecast live on November 22,"" pageant Executive Director Keith Lewis said Tuesday. ""We're back in the business of beauty,"" he told CNN. There was nothing pretty about the public fight that began in April when Prejean, 22, stepped into controversy by declaring her opposition to same-sex marriage while answering a judge's question at the Miss USA pageant. Prejean finished as first runner-up. While state and national pageant officials publicly supported her initially, their opinions eventually changed after she continued to make public statements about same-sex marriage. She held onto her crown through May, despite a series of questionable photos that emerged on gossip Web sites. Those images showed a topless Prejean, photographed from behind. She was dethroned in June by Miss USA pageant owner Donald Trump amid growing complaints by state officials that she was uncooperative and not meeting her contractual obligations. Prejean filed her lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court in August, claiming that her firing was religious discrimination because of her stand against same-sex marriage. The pageant's countercomplaint said what it called Prejean's belligerent behavior, lack of cooperation and contract breaches caused her firing, not her opposition to same-sex marriage.","Carrie Prejean was dethroned as Miss California USA and sued pageant .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of inmates using pipes and shanks as weapons trashed a California prison, burning a courtyard, ripping beds to shreds and tearing bathroom sinks from walls, a new video of the weekend riot's aftermath shows. A dormitory is trashed after a riot at the California Institution for men, in Chino. Video shot by CNN affiliate KABC-TV gave the first glimpse of the damage to the California Institution for Men in Chino from a riot that authorities said was ignited by racial tensions. ""This certainly is probably the worst that we've seen, especially adding the extensive damage to the unit that has been burned,"" prison spokesman Lt. Mark Hargrove told reporters outside the prison Tuesday. ""That has never happened at this facility before."" The riot erupted Saturday night and raged until Sunday morning, injuring 250 inmates. Fifty-five inmates were taken to hospitals with serious injuries, including stab wounds and head trauma.  Watch the aftermath of the violence » . ""The prison is still under a state of emergency,"" George Kostyrko, a spokesman for the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation told CNN, which means no visitors were allowed and the prison could not take any new inmates. Corrections officials said they transferred about 1,150 inmates to other facilities.  ""The ones that are there are likely in a lockdown mode until an investigation can determine whether or not they were directly responsible for the riot,"" Kostyrko said. The decision to lock down the Chino prison and nine others in southern California was still in effect Tuesday. ""The lockdowns will remain in effect until all the staff that we deployed to Chino from other areas go back home,"" Kostyrko said. The measure was taken to prevent copy-cat violence. Though other races were involved, the altercations at Chino mostly involved Hispanics and African-Americans, Kostyrko said. About 80 officers responded to the scene, but none of the staff was injured. A housing unit was heavily damaged by fire. Prisoners broke windows and pulled down pipes to use as weapons, Kostyrko said. The facility has seven units, each of which houses about 200 inmates. In one of the torched dormitories, burned red prison uniforms were strewn everywhere, the floor was covered with ankle-high ashes, windows were shattered and there was a large hole in the roof. In the mounds of trash that littered the floor of the dorm, a rusty foot-long pipe could be seen. Most of the residential areas were badly damaged and some inmates were being temporarily housed in tents, the spokesman said. Chino is about 35 miles east of Los Angeles.","Video gives glimpse of damage to the California Institution for Men in Chino .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Search-and-rescue efforts at a supermarket in Haiti's capital have ended after teams determined no one else was alive beneath the rubble, an official told CNN Wednesday. A French excavation team was working at the Caribbean Supermarket on Tuesday. Several Haitians had been in the building at the time, looking for survivors or useful items. At least one of these foragers became trapped in the rubble. While the French team was trying to rescue that person, their excavation machine, which resembles a bulldozer, tipped into a hole and caused a further collapse, said Lt. Col. Christophe Renou of French Civil Protection. The French team called in U.S. and Mexican teams to help with the rescue. The U.S. team brought more radar and lifting devices to try to extract the known survivor and reach any others, said Norman Skjelbreia, an incident commander from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. But at 11 p.m. Tuesday, the teams determined there was no one else alive under the rubble, and they called off the rescue mission, Renou told CNN Wednesday. He said information gathered from radar and listening equipment detected no signs of life. The rescue was an extremely dangerous one, he said, with pieces of concrete shifting. At one point, he said, a female Mexican rescue worker was trapped under the rubble and teams had to work to save her life. It was decided that the safety of the search-and-rescue teams was more important than the search to retrieve bodies from the precarious collapsed building, Renou said. More than 212,000 people died in the January 12 earthquake, Haitian officials said. Caribbean Supermarket was the scene of a number of rescues after the earthquake, including the rescue of five people in one weekend. Rescuers pulled an apparent survivor of the original quake, Evan Muncie, 28, from the rubble of another market on Monday. Doctors found him suffering from extreme dehydration and malnutrition, but without significant crushing injuries. CNN's Ingrid Formanek contributed to this report.","French team had been trying to rescue a person Tuesday when secondary collapse occurred .

"(CNN) -- Seth MacFarlane: Sarah Palin expressed outrage at a Fox television program, created by MacFarlane, for joking about people with Down syndrome and making an apparent reference to her 22-month-old son, Trig, who has the genetic disorder. The former Alaska governor said on her Facebook page that she was too angry to offer a coherent response, so she had her daughter Bristol release a full statement on the family's behalf. The Palins directed their criticism at the prime-time Fox cartoon, ""Family Guy."" In Sunday's episode, a teenaged female character with Down syndrome told another character that ""my mom is the former governor of Alaska."" A song and dance routine by another character also used language that ridiculed people with disabilities. According to the show's Web site, ""Family Guy"" earned an Emmy nomination in 2009 for Outstanding Comedy Series, ""only the second animated series in television history to be honored with such distinction."" On the show, MacFarlane performs the voices of the father, Peter Griffin, and his 1-year-old son, Stewie, who is, the Fox Web site reports, ""a diabolically clever baby whose heterosexuality is hanging by a thread."" MacFarlane is also the voice of the intellectually superior family dog. The Web site Seth McFarlane Unlimited reports that MacFarlane began drawing cartoons at the age of 2 and is the recipient of two honorary degrees. While receiving the one from Harvard in 2006, he delivered the Class Day Speech playing the roles of several of the characters from ""Family Guy."" He also received a degree in 2007 from his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design. CNN Political Ticker: Palin slams Fox's 'Family Guy' 'Family Guy': About the show . Dalai Lama: The Tibetan spiritual leader is on his way to the United States for a number of speaking engagements and is scheduled to meet with President Obama on Thursday, even though China has warned that such a meeting would harm ties between it and the United States, a White House spokesman said on February 2. ""The president told China's leaders during his trip last year that he would meet with the Dalai Lama, and he intends to do so,"" Bill Burton told reporters earlier this month. China warned that ties between two of the world's superpowers would be strained if Obama met with the Dalai Lama. ""It will seriously undermine the foundation of Sino-U.S. political relations,"" said Zhu Weiqun, a Communist Party official who is in charge of talks with representatives of the Dalai Lama. Beijing accuses the Dalai Lama of advocating for Tibetan independence from China. In explaining Obama's intention to hold the meeting, Burton said the Dalai Lama ""is an internationally respected religious and cultural leader, and the president will meet with him in that capacity."" Tibet is technically autonomous from the central Chinese government, but the Dalai Lama and others have said they favor genuine autonomy and resent the slow erosion of their culture amid an influx of Han Chinese, the most numerous ethnic group in China. Zhu said there would be no compromise on China's control of Tibet. The 14th Dalai Lama was born in July 1935. According to his official biography, the child named Lhamo Dhondup at that time was recognized at the age of 2 as the reincarnation of the 13th Dalai Lama. He went through years of monastic training and assumed political power in 1950, a year after China's invasion. The Dalai Lama ultimately fled China in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule. He lives in exile in the north Indian town of Dharamsala.

Jesse Sullivan: The 25-year-old from Petersburg, Illinois, has been living for two weeks at the corner of Florida and North Capitol Avenues in Washington. He's been living there in a tent to show solidarity with Haitian families in crisis, he says, and to remind people that emergency shelter is still sorely needed for victims of the January 12 earthquake. When CNN reached him by phone in his tent Tuesday, he explained that he was recently in Washington to figure out how to work in Afghanistan, but realized that the situation in Haiti was a more pressing need. So he went to the Haitian Embassy to volunteer in any way he could. He says a minister at the embassy came up with the official-sounding title ""special assistant to the Haitian Embassy for relief and reconstruction,"" which Sullivan now uses informally. When he passed a nearby statue of the Indian political and spiritual leader Mahatma Gandhi, Sullivan read the inscription, ""My Life is My Message,"" and the idea of staying in the tent came to him. Sullivan, who has a master's degree in global governance and diplomacy from The University of Oxford in England, says he plans to live in the tent for at least one month. ""If I can still be effective, I'll stay there for a year."" The tent is pitched in the private parking lot of a pizza restaurant with the permission of its owner. Sullivan told CNN, ""The police stop by to make sure I'm OK and not too crazy."" He says his parents are a bit concerned, yet somewhat relieved. ""My initial plan was to head to Afghanistan, but for my dad and mom, anything that's not Afghanistan makes them pretty happy."" Next week, Sullivan plans to hold a news conference at his tent to announce his ""Live for Haiti"" campaign. He said, ""It's not about us saving Haiti. This crisis has the opportunity that Haiti is going to save us from a narrow American dream -- one that doesn't recognize that we are connected to people around the world."" Live for Haiti . Samuel J. Wurzelbacher aka Joe the Plumber: Just when you think someone's 15 minutes of fame are up, politics manages to reset the clock. Wurzelbacher, who gained notoriety during the last presidential campaign as ""Joe the Plumber,"" spoke this past weekend in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, at an event on behalf of state Rep. Sam Roher, who is running for governor. Scott Detrow of Pennsylvania's Public Radio Capitol News reports that Wurzelbacher told him that more than 200 politicians wanted his support, but he's backed only five so far. He's now supporting grass-roots Tea Party movements. During his speech, Wurzelbacher said he doesn't support Sarah Palin any more because the former Alaska governor is backing Sen. John McCain's re-election effort. ""John McCain is no public servant,"" he told the room, calling McCain a career politician. When Detrow pointed out that without McCain, he'd just be plain old Sam Wurzelbacher of Ohio -- Joe the Plumber wouldn't exist -- his response was, ""I don't owe him s---. He really screwed my life up, is how I look at it."" Wurzelbacher told the reporter, ""McCain was trying to use me. I happened to be the face of Middle Americans. It was a ploy."" Wurzelbacher first gained fame in 2008 when he told candidate Barack Obama that he was worried that rolling back President Bush's tax breaks would prevent him from buying a plumbing company that would earn between $250,000 and $280,000 a year.

All these years later, people still want to know. Simon has never revealed the answer. But at Carlysimon.com, she does list some of her former boyfriends: Mick Jagger, Cat Stevens, Warren Beatty, Kris Kristofferson. Simon has also never made a music video of the song. (For purists, Janet Jackson did sample ""You're So Vain"" in her 2001 music video, ""Son of A Gun."") Simon has just announced a contest on the Web site, inviting fans and filmmakers to create a music video, using the original or new version of her song. She will screen all entries herself, select a winner, and meet the filmmaker -- whose winning entry will also be premiered at the 2010 Tribeca Film Festival. Simon says she has always been amazed by the attention given to the mystery person in the song. In 2004, she gave hints to CNN: ""Well, I guess for those who are interested in clues -- the name of the person it was about had an E in it."" That could indicate Jagger, Beatty or James Taylor. She continued, ""Maybe I could disclose another letter. OK, it also has an A."" In announcing the music video contest, Simon does not indicate that she will ever reveal the name. CarlySimon.com . What makes a person intriguing? There are people who enter the news cycle every day because their actions or decisions are new, important or different. Others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect. And there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news. Some of these people do what we expect of them: They run for office, pass legislation, start a business, get hired or fired, commit a crime, make an arrest, get in accidents, hit a home run, overthrow a government, fight wars, sue an opponent, put out fires, prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses. They do make news, but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story.

"(CNN) -- Neda Agha-Soltan: The night before she was killed on the streets of Tehran, the woman the world would come to know simply as Neda had a dream. ""There was a war going on,"" she told her mother, Hajar Rostami, the next morning, ""and I was in the front."" Neda's mother had joined her in the street protests that erupted after Iran's disputed June 12 presidential election. But on that fateful morning, she told her daughter she couldn't go with her. As Neda prepared to leave, the mother told CNN last November, she was filled with anxiety. ""I told her to be very careful, and she said she would."" On June 20, Neda, 26, headed to Tehran's Nilofar Square, where thousands of protesters gathered. Tear gas was lobbed at the crowd. Her eyes burning, Neda headed to a medical clinic to get them washed. Neda later walked toward her car, parked on a side street not far from the heated protests. A single bullet struck her chest, and Neda was dead. On Monday, Long Island University announced it was awarding a 2009 George Polk Award, one of journalism's highest honors, to the unknown videographer who captured Neda's final moments -- her collapse on the street and her death. The New York Times reports that this is the first time in the 61-year history of the prestigious awards that judges have given the honor to work done anonymously. ""This video footage was seen by millions and became an iconic image of the Iranian resistance,"" John Darnton, curator of the Polk Awards, told the newspaper. ""We don't know who took it or who uploaded it, but we do know it has news value.

William Ward Warren: When President Kennedy and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy arrived at Dallas Love Field on November 22, 1963, there were as many as 100 photographers there, mostly shooting black and white film. On Monday, the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza in Dallas released never-before-seen, 8 mm amateur color film taken by Warren. According to a release by museum curator Gary Mack, Warren was 15 at the time of the assassination, and because students were given the day off for the president's visit, he took his camera to Love Field to watch the arrival of Air Force One. ""My dad operated a furniture store adjacent to the airport, and so that morning on his way to work, he dropped me off at the airport to see [President Kennedy] come in,"" Warren said, according to the museum release. ""It was cool and yet the sun was shining bright, and there was lots of excitement."" Kennedy was killed less than an hour after Warren captured the start of his visit to Texas.

Dafna Michaelson: The former director of volunteer services at a Denver, Colorado, hospital -- and a single mother of two children -- left her job and spent all 52 weeks of 2009 traveling to all 50 states and Washington. She funded her ""50 in 52 Journey"" by draining her 401k -- the entire $31,000 -- and then asking others for donations. Her goal was to collect the stories of ordinary Americans who were making a difference in their local communities and to share those stories on her Web site. She ultimately interviewed more than 500 people, blogged regularly and posted 370 videos. In January, she launched the Journey Institute, telling CNN on Monday, ""One main thing I heard while traveling was, if they didn't have someone to push them or mentor them or train them, they wouldn't have been able to put their idea into action."" So after her journey, Michaelson decided to help people get their ideas off the couch and put them into action. Her plan is to bring people from every state facing similar challenges to Denver and give them training on how to solve those problems. Michaelson said, ""No matter where I went, I met people who were the same as the pioneers who built this country. They not only had to build their barns and plant their fields, they had to help their neighbors do the same. The people I met had the same values as those pioneers."" 50 in 52 Journey Web site . The Denver Post: Woman travels nation, documents people making life better . Kim Jong Il: Tuesday is the ""Dear Leader's"" birthday, but where, do you ask, was he born in 1942? His official biography declares it was at the foothills of Mount Baekdu, North Korea's sacred mountain, amid bright lights and double rainbows. But historians are pretty sure he was born at a guerrilla base under Soviet protection in the Soviet Union. The discrepancy should not surprise. When Time magazine's Frances Romero wrote about the supreme leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the profile began, ""An easy way of summing up Kim's life in one sentence would be to throw in the words reportedly, allegedly and the occasional is said to."" His father, Kim Il Sung, founded North Korea, and his son ran the country more or less for 20 years as his father aged, taking power officially in 1997, a few years after his father's death. ""Here's a guy who is very concerned about his physical stature, among other things,"" said Dr. Jerrold Post, a former CIA psychologist who heads the political psychology program at George Washington University. ""He's 5-foot-2 and wears 4-inch lifts in his shoes."" Post, in his book ""Leaders and Their Followers in a Dangerous World,"" writes that Kim also loved to drink a certain Hennessy cognac that sold for $630 a bottle in Korea. Hennessy, the maker of Paradis cognac, confirmed that Kim was the biggest buyer of the cognac, and between 1988 and 1998, maintained an estimated annual account of $650,000 to $800,000. Post wrote the ruler ""annually spent 770 times the income of the average North Korean citizen ($1,038) on cognac alone!"" Post told CNN that Kim Jong Il once kidnapped the most prominent South Korean movie star and kept her under house arrest with her husband for eight years. And he has a collection of some 20,000 videotapes, including the complete James Bond movie collection. In August 2008, Kim had a stroke and was out of view for some time, and now seems to have recovered. Post said he believes that some of his toughness on North Korean nuclear policy now may be the indication of a power struggle at the end of his rule. CNN: North Korea marks Kim Jong Il's birthday .

There are people who enter the news cycle every day because their actions or decisions are new, important or different. Others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect. And there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news. Some of these people do what we expect of them: They run for office, pass legislation, start a business, get hired or fired, commit a crime, make an arrest, get in accidents, hit a home run, overthrow a government, fight wars, sue an opponent, put out fires, prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses. They do make news, but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story. But every day, there are a number of people who become fascinating to us -- by virtue of their character, how they reached their decision, how they behaved under pressure or because of the remarkable circumstances surrounding the event they are involved in. They arouse our curiosity. We hear about them and want to know more. What they have done or said stimulates conversations across the country. At times, there is even a mystery about them. What they have done may be unique, heroic, cowardly or ghastly, but they capture our imaginations. We want to know what makes them tick, why they believe what they do, and why they did what they did.

"(CNN) -- Sen. John McCain on Monday called for a $300 million prize to whoever can develop a battery that will ""leapfrog"" the abilities of current hybrid and electric cars. Sen. John McCain wants someone to develop a battery that can ""leapfrog"" those available in current electric cars. Citing high oil prices, the Republican presidential candidate said he wants his offer to ""deliver a power source at 30 percent of the current costs."" ""[The prize would amount to] $1 for every man, woman and child in the U.S. -- a small price to pay for helping to break the back of our oil dependency,"" McCain said during a town hall-style meeting at California's Fresno State University. McCain said the new automobile battery should have ""the size, capacity, cost and power to leapfrog the commercially available plug-in hybrids or electric cars.""  Watch more on McCain's $300 million reward » . ""In the quest for alternatives to oil, our government has thrown around enough money subsidizing special interests and excusing failure,"" McCain said. ""From now on, we will encourage heroic efforts in engineering, and we will reward the greatest success."" McCain also called Monday for a ""Clean Car Challenge"" for U.S. automakers, hoping to spur them to develop and sell vehicles with no carbon emissions. The challenge would allow $5,000 tax credits to buyers of such cars, making those vehicles more appealing to consumers and thus easier to sell. ""We're going to see technology for electric-powered cars that are going to be [made cheaper] with our incentives,"" McCain said. McCain also spoke against policies that he said ""prevent consumers from benefiting"" from ethanol not made from corn. He cited the U.S. subsidies for corn-based ethanol and tariffs on sugar cane-based ethanol from Brazil. ""Instead of playing favorites, our government should level the playing field for all alcohol fuels that break the monopoly of gasoline, both lowering gasoline prices and carbon emissions,"" he said. McCain's remarks came a day after his Democratic rival, Sen. Barack Obama, called for greater oversight for energy traders. Obama's campaign said many economists believe speculation could be adding between $20 and $50 to the price of a barrel of oil; the price per barrel closed near $135 on Friday. On Monday, the Illinois Democrat turned to the subject of working women, criticizing McCain for opposing a bill that would have made it easier for people to sue over pay discrimination.  Watch Obama court working women » . The bill, dubbed the Fair Pay Restoration Act, would have rolled back a 2007 Supreme Court ruling that a person who claims pay discrimination must file a complaint within 180 days of that discrimination taking place. Senate Republicans blocked the bill, which Obama co-sponsored, in April. Obama, in a speech to women at the Flying Star Cafe in Albuquerque, New Mexico, said McCain ""thinks the Supreme Court got it right."" ""He opposed the Fair Pay Restoration Act,"" Obama said. ""He suggested that the reason women don't have equal pay isn't discrimination on the job -- it's because they need more education and training. That's just wrong."" Obama said that in the United States, women earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men. Obama claimed that McCain said the Fair Pay Restoration Act would have opened ""us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems."" ""But I can't think of any problem more important than making sure that women are getting a square deal on the job. It's a matter of equality. It's a matter of fairness,"" Obama said. ""I'll continue to stand up for equal pay as president. Sen. McCain won't, and that's a real difference in this election."" Meanwhile, monthly campaign finance reports filed in June show the candidates are nearly level in the amount of money they have available to spend before their parties' conventions. According to a report filed with the Federal Election Commission, Obama had $43.1 million in the bank at the start of June. However, $9.8 million of that amount is designated for the general election, meaning only the remaining $33.3 million may be spent before the conventions. McCain, according to his report filed with the FEC, began June with about $31.4 million available to spend before the conventions. McCain had only $123,000 set aside for the general election. However, since indicating he will accept public financing for the general election, he has returned nearly all of the money he has raised for it. Obama said last week he would not accept public financing. Republicans and outside analysts have said Obama found he could raise more money than public financing would allow him to spend. The Democratic convention is scheduled for August 25-28 in Denver, Colorado. The GOP convention is set for September 1-4 in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota.","NEW: Sen.

"(CNN) -- A Pennsylvania soccer mom was chatting with a friend via webcam when she was shot to death by her husband, who then went upstairs and shot himself, police said Friday. Pistol-packing soccer mom Meleanie Hain was shot dead while chatting with a friend on a webcam, police said. Meleanie Hain, 31, made national headlines last year as the mother who carried a loaded, holstered handgun to her 5-year-old daughter's soccer game. She was found dead in her Lebanon, Pennsylvania, home along with her husband, Scott Hain, 33, on Wednesday evening, Lebanon police said. Hain was in her kitchen talking with a friend via webcam just before her death, police said.  Watch why Hain caused controversy » . The friend, who police will not name, was looking away from the computer screen when he heard a shot and a scream, police said. He turned back to the monitor, he told police, and no longer saw Meleanie Hain but instead saw Scott Hain firing several rounds from a handgun toward where his wife had been. Police said that the woman's body had already fallen to the floor by the time the friend turned back to the screen. Scott Hain then went upstairs to a bedroom, where he shot himself in the head with a 12-gauge shotgun, police said. Meleanie Hain was shot several times with a 9 mm handgun, police said. Her fully loaded 9 mm handgun was found in her backpack hanging on the back of the front door. The couple's three children were home at the time of the killings, police Capt. Daniel Wright said. They were unharmed and took refuge at a neighbor's house before police arrived, he said. Investigators have confiscated the webcam and computer, but cannot review what the friend says he saw because the online conversation was not recorded. The death of the couple came four months after Meleanie Hain told her attorney she was separating from her husband, her attorney, Matthew B. Weisberg, told CNN Thursday. However, police said the couple still appeared to be living together. Meleanie Hain drew media attention on September 11, 2008, when she carried a Glock strapped to her belt to her daughter's soccer game. Nine days later her permit to carry a gun was revoked by Lebanon County Sheriff Michael DeLeo, who claimed she showed poor judgment by wearing the weapon to a child's game. County Judge Robert Eby later reinstated the permit. CNN's Edmund DeMarche and Susan Candiotti contributed to this story .","Police: Meleanie Hain shot by husband, Scott, in Pennsylvania home .

"San Juan, Puerto Rico (CNN) -- A humanitarian mission to aid Haitian earthquake victims turned into a major embarrassment in Puerto Rico on Friday as pictures emerged of doctors drinking, mugging for cameras and brandishing firearms amid the victims' suffering. The ethics committee of the commonwealth's medical board said it was launching an investigation into whether those involved should be disciplined. Puerto Rican Secretary of Health Lorenzo Gonzalez called the episode ""a sad situation."" ""The poor judgment of a few basically damages the beautiful effort that many others have put in place in terms of providing good medical care,"" Gonzalez said. ""When I saw the pictures, I was very concerned that they have taken pictures of people without any consent."" Some of the photos, which were posted on the social networking site Facebook, show smiling doctors holding guns or toasting each other, bottles of scotch or other alcohol in their hands. Others show medical personnel in what appears to be a clinic, grinning as they attend to patients. Another shows a quake victim on a hospital bed, naked from the waist down except for a thin strip of cloth covering the genitals. ""You can't ever take pictures of patients if you don't have a written agreement and much less publish photos of patients half-nude,"" the president of the College of Physicians and Surgeons told CNN. Dr. Eduardo Ibarra added, ""This is a clear violation of the Hippocratic Oath ... We're going to take all the measures possible to correct this."" Ibarra said some of the photographs were taken in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic after the group had operated on 70 patients who were in critical condition. ""In any form, the question of drinking beer while wearing their surgical gear is bad -- it's like a police officer drinking beer while wearing their uniform,"" he said. ""They violated the rules of conduct."" He said the ethics committee members would identify the doctors and evaluate their acts, ""always with the presumption of innocence."" Though the committee has yet to decide on a course of action, some doctors have already suffered consequences, he said. ""Some of them already lost their jobs,"" he said. ""They're going to lose probably their careers. It's a mess. Only because of some stupidity."" An anesthesiologist who traveled with the group said she was saddened by the photographs, but said her colleagues ""gave 200 percent"" with limited resources. ""Their work was excellent,"" Dr. Enid Garcia told Puerto Rico's Primera Hora newspaper. The story led the Friday evening news broadcast of CNN affiliate WAPA, in San Juan, which devoted 12 minutes to the subject, including an interview with one of the doctors who appeared in a photograph carrying a rifle. ""I regret it,"" said Dr. Carlos Ortiz. He said the pictures were intended as nothing more than a reminder of their work, and that soldiers had handed them their weapons to hold while posing. The embarrassment was heightened by the fact that the mission was coordinated by Puerto Rico's Senate. Days after the January 12 quake in Haiti, the Senate announced it would oversee sending more than 100 doctors to set up a field hospital near the town of Jimani, across the border in the Dominican Republic. The town has been flooded with Haitians injured in the quake, seeking medical help unavailable at home. Prior to sending the medical professionals on January 15, Senate President Thomas Rivera Schatz told them, ""With you goes the heart of all the people of Puerto Rico."" On Friday, in a news release, he called the conduct of some of them ""imprudent"" and ""indiscreet."" The soldiers should be investigated, he said, for having allowed the health professionals to pose with their weapons. CNN's Nick Valencia, Benjamin Fernandez and Jennifer Deaton in Atlanta, Georgia, contributed to this report.","Anesthesiologist who traveled with the group: ""Their work was excellent""

"Editor's note: On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" host and Chief National Correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country. Joe Ray, left, says the cost of providing full-time workers with health care is worth it. PORTLAND, Maine (CNN) -- Joe Ray has no complaints about the economy but plenty of worries about what he sees and hears in Washington. His company, Free Range Fish & Lobster, processes 8 million pounds of fish a year, plus shellfish and lobsters. A recession means restaurant sales are down some, but that decline is more than offset by the surge in people looking for seafood as they eat more meals at home. ""We're up about 30 percent,"" Ray said during a tour of the operation along the Portland waterfront. He says the cost of providing full-time workers with health care is expensive but worth it. ""To keep good employees,"" he said. ""So you don't have to keep changing the flow of people that are coming in and out. It costs money to do that, too."" But when it comes to the debate over national health care reform, Ray sees the price as out of line with what the country can afford right now.  Watch CNN's John King preview Sunday's show from a dock in Maine » . ""I think I'd rather just be left alone,"" Ray said. ""Just pay my bill and try to deal with it that way."" A fiscal conservative, he has a simple view of President Obama. ""Right now, he is just spending, spending, spending, and I just hope it helps the country,"" Ray says. Paul Hogan is on the other end of the country's health care tug-of-war . ""It is just a crazy system, and it needs to be fixed,"" said Hogan, a retired attorney who held a party at his Kennebunkport home Wednesday evening to watch Obama's speech to Congress. He posted notice of his viewing party on the Obama political organization Web site but in the end watched the speech with a half-dozen friends and neighbors. No strangers signed up, as was common at such events during the Web-driven Obama presidential campaign. ""I think it is much harder to get people involved in an issue,"" Hogan said. ""I think there are lots of people who will get involved every two years or every four years and will talk to their neighbors for elections."" Maine is an interesting stage in the health care debate for a number of reasons. Consider just these two: . • The decline in support for Obama's handling of health care has been pronounced among Americans who consider themselves political independents, and in Maine, nearly four out of every 10 voters is ""unenrolled"" or independent of any political party. In the latest CNN polling, for example, 45 percent of all Americans disapproved of how Obama is handling his job as president. Among independents, his disapproval rating was 53 percent. And specifically on health care, 44 percent of all Americans approve of Obama's handling of the health care issue, while 53 percent disapprove. Among independents, only 33 percent approve of the president's handling of health care, while 61 percent disapprove. • Maine's two U.S. senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, are among the handful of realistic Republican targets as the White House tries to get at least modest GOP support. Snowe, in particular, has a crucial voice at the moment because of her seat on the Senate Finance Committee. We visited Snowe's Portland office the morning after the president's speech, and it was clear that she was getting mixed advice. ""No gov't h c.,"" an office worker scribbled on a legal pad as she took one of the dozens of morning calls. ""Supp Publ Opt,"" is another notation made during a call a few minutes later, shorthand for supporting the public option that Obama and most Democrats would prefer to compete with private insurers. Snowe is skeptical of the public option and has been trying to negotiate an alternative with the White House and colleagues on the Finance Committee. Collins, usually described as slightly more conservative than Snowe, is even more skeptical of such an expanded government role. In the end, though, those who know the state's independent politics well say that both senators have a lot of leeway despite the high stakes and high emotions of the health care debate. ""Generally, what people in Maine vote for is what works"" is how Angus King, who was elected to two terms as governor as an independent, describes the state's less ideological politics. ""I would call it pragmatism. ... They seem more interested in getting things done than necessarily lining up in a partisan way."" Speaking specifically of Snowe and her prominent role at the moment in health care talks, King said, ""She is the winningest politician in Maine history. She is enormously popular, and I think she can do whatever she wants."" The former governor says that because independents are by definition a varied group, he sees no one reason Obama's standing among these voters on the health care issue has dropped. For some it is probably worries about the costs; others perhaps are disappointed the president has not had more early success delivering on his promise to change Washington. ""I think people are going to say, 'OK, what's working and what's happening down there?' "" said King, an Obama supporter. ""This health care thing is very important. Not only important substantively but symbolically. ""Can he lead? Can he put something across the line? Is he tough enough?""","CNN's State of the Union with John King airs Sunday at 9 a.m. ET .

"Sumatra, Indonesia (CNN) -- A loud crack echoes throughout the canopy as two young orangutans come tumbling down, grasping at branches along the way to break their fall. They recover and sheepishly scamper back up. This is lesson one of jungle school here in the forests of central Sumatra, one of the few places where orangutans are being successfully rehabilitated into the wild. ""They have to learn that their whole environment is completely different from the cage,"" says Peter Pratje of the Frankfurt Zoological Society. ""They have to learn that branches and small trees -- the size of bars in the cage -- don't carry them any longer. They bend and break."" ""During the first phase of this jungle training, they are very often falling out of the trees because they use rotten branches."" The two youngsters swing awkwardly between the trees. On the ground below, their trainers keep a watchful eye and try to coax them toward fruit trees. Learning to forage is another crucial lesson in survival. Back in the massive enclosure, the orangutans undergo enrichment exercises to keep their minds occupied and prolong their feeding time. Success here is critical. Scientists say the Sumatran orangutan will be the first great ape to go extinct. ""The orangutan is an extremely vulnerable species because they have a very slow breeding cycle. Usually an orangutan stays for around 7 to 9 years with its mother,"" Pratje says. ""Besides natural mortality, if there is only a little increase in mortality over a longer time already it drives an orangutan population to extinction."" The numbers of Sumatran orangutans have already dwindled to around  6,000. The main reason for that is habitat destruction. Sumatra has lost 85 percent of its natural forest, mainly due to palm oil and pulp and paper companies, scientists say. The sanctuary, a Frankfurt Zoological Project, is just outside the Bukit Tigapuluh National Park. The lowlands surrounding it are an ideal habitat for orangutans, and it's where those that have been released are choosing to build their habitats. According to the environmental group WWF, it's also home to the endangered Sumatran elephant and a quarter of the critically endangered Sumatran tigers left in the wild. But the area, which is not currently protected, is being threatened by pulp and paper companies that want to see the region turned into plantations. So far the government has rejected logging permits, but unless this is declared a conservation area, Pratje and other conservationists fear that could change. So far, more than 100 orangutans have been released here, with just over a dozen more in various stages of training. Pratje has lived here since he established the sanctuary seven years ago, dedicating his entire life to this project. ""It's like fighting for a member of my family,"" he says. ""I love them because they are smart, smarter than other great apes."" But he says the fight is not just about the extinction of a species. The orangutan has become the ambassador for the threatened rainforest. ""If we sacrifice these forests, we may sacrifice our chances for getting medicine for important diseases,"" he says. ""The problem is there is no second chance. If you shut down an ecosystem that is hundreds of years old, you can't regrow it any longer. ""So this is the last chance.""","Peter Pratje says orangutans in Sumatra are threatened by pulp and paper companies .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- An $80 million research project aimed at giving people 50 active years after the age of 50 was launched by scientists at the University of Leeds in northern England Tuesday. The challenge is to ensure old people stay as fit as Brisbane centenarian Ruth Frith, seen competing at shot put during World Masters Games in Sydney this month. About half of the babies born in Western countries today will live until they are 100 years old, according to recent research published in the medical journal The Lancet, so the challenge is to ensure they remain active throughout their old age. While most of us will live longer than our parents and grandparents, the aging population means that in coming decades more people will suffer from age-related conditions such as osteoarthritis, heart disease and chronic back pain. Obesity and increased physical activity also put more pressure on our joints, causing them to wear out faster. Scientists at Leeds University envisage that many of the body parts that flounder with age could be upgraded using own-grown tissues and more durable implants. This will mean artificial hips, knees and heart valves, for example, lasting far longer than the current 20-year typical lifespan. ""Our work is driven by the concept of 50 more years after 50 -- that is, making our second 50 years of life as healthy, comfortable and active as our first, so we can enjoy a higher quality of life,"" explains Professor John Fisher, who is an expert in artificial joints and tissue regeneration. ""We now have the technology available to do astonishing things, such as repairing the body by growing healthy new tissue through biological scaffolds and stem cell therapy. And a new generation of prosthetic hip and knee joints that last longer will avoid the need for further replacements."" Fisher says the center also hopes to gain a better understanding of degenerative diseases to allow for early diagnosis, rather than having to treat someone when they are already in crippling pain. ""For example, we're developing biosensor tools that can detect the presence of antibodies and proteins in the blood. All of these technologies will ultimately reduce suffering in patients through more timely interventions, shorter hospital stays and quicker recovery times."" So how do you feel about this. Are you looking forward to your old age? Do you believe you will remain active?

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- One of the the country's most powerful unions stepped up its campaign for a hotly disputed labor bill Monday, holding a rally on the eve of the bill's formal introduction in Congress. Workers rally in support of the Employee Free Choice act in Lafayette Square in Washington on Monday. The legislation -- the Employee Free Choice Act -- would create an alternate process for bringing a union into a workplace. It is supported by President Barack Obama and the Democratic congressional leadership, but is fiercely opposed by most congressional Republicans and corporate leaders, who fear it will saddle a sagging business community with new burdens at the worst possible time. Business leaders ""believe in this old market-worshipping, privatizing, deregulating, trickle-down [policy] that took the greatest economy on the Earth and sent it staggering forward because of their greed and their selfishness,"" declared Service Employees International Union President Andy Stern. ""Without the Employee Free Choice Act ... the rich will get richer and the rest of us will fend for ourselves."" Sterns issued his warning as his 1.8 million-member union prepared for a daylong Capitol Hill lobbying blitz on behalf of the bill Tuesday. Democrats and Republicans may disagree sharply over the merits of the legislation, but leaders on both sides of the aisle freely admit it has the potential to significantly reshape the balance of power between business and labor for the first time in years. The controversial act would allow employees to signal support for unionizing by openly signing a card demanding it. If a majority signed, the company involved would have 90 days to negotiate union representation. It would also stiffen federal laws barring employers from intimidating or firing workers who try to bring in a union. The traditional option to vote by secret ballot would still be available. But critics say the measure -- dubbed the ""card check"" bill by its opponents -- would effectively eliminate union elections, removing a fundamental hard-earned right of workers and forcing some workers into unions they don't want to join. Some corporate leaders have reacted angrily against the measure. If a retailer has not gotten involved with fight over this bill, he ""should be shot,"" Bernie Marcus, co-founder and former CEO of The Home Depot, said during a conference call about the act last October. Retailers who don't speak out against it ""should be thrown out of their goddamn jobs."" ""This is how a civilization disappears,"" Marcus said. ""I'm sitting here as an elder statesman, and I'm watching this happen, and I don't believe it."" Dave Bego, a business owner in Indianapolis, Indiana, shares Marcus' concern. Bego is the owner of EMS, which provides janitors to businesses around the country. The family-owned company has been under fire from the SEIU, which argues that EMS intimidates, harasses and violates the rights of workers wanting to unionize. It has made the company a target of repeated protests for about three years. Bego said the claims are unfounded, and it's the union that has harassed him. He said the union has sent his clients threatening letters for using his company, staged noisy protests, confronted employees, blocked building entrances and even released balloons in a client's building to disrupt business. But he told CNN his workers don't want a union because they make more in pay and benefits without having to pay SEIU's labor dues. ""We have several hundred people working for us in Indianapolis [alone],"" Bego said. ""They've been after us for almost three years, and they've got only about 10 or 12 people interested in what they said. If our people really needed protecting, don't you think they'd be out in mass droves in the street with the union protesting EMS? Do you think we'd still be in business? I don't think so."" But union workers CNN talked to say workers at EMS are afraid to speak out because they might get fired, as Shaneka Brown said she was. ""We're not the only ones,"" Brown said. ""There are millions of other janitors and millions and millions of other companies that are going through same"" kinds of things. And that, says Stern, is why the Free Choice Act is so critical. The SEIU president claims the legislation merely provides employees who have been intimidated by their employers an opportunity to freely and openly support a union. ""This is workers' choice,"" Stern said in February. ""They can have a secret ballot, or they can legally affirm by a majority of them signing cards."" Observers believe Stern's union has the muscle to push the legislation through the Democratically controlled Congress. The SEIU was the largest contributor to Democratic campaigns this election, pumping $85 million into campaigns and get-out-the-vote drives. The union said 2,000 members temporarily gave up their jobs to work for Obama's election. Now ""we have a friend in the White House,"" Stern declared Monday. ""Thank God for Barack Obama.""

"(CNN)  -- Honduran prosecutors issued arrest warrants for the country's six top military commanders for abuse of power in connection with the coup that ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya last year. The Honduran high command, including Gen. Romeo Vasquez Velasquez, the country's top military chief, face charges for bursting into Zelaya's residence and transporting the president to neighboring Costa Rica, Attorney General Luis Rubi said. The June 28 coup deepened a political crisis that remains unresolved, despite a new president being elected in November. Rubi himself filed the arrest warrants at the Supreme Court on Wednesday. In addition to abuse of power, the military commanders face charges of illegal expatriation of a citizen. The manner in which Zelaya was ousted was key in how other countries and international bodies interpreted the military action. The de facto government of Roberto Micheletti and his supporters have insisted that Zelaya's removal was a constitutional transfer of power. But the United Nations, the Organization of American States, the European Union and most nations -- including the United States -- condemned the coup and demanded that Zelaya be reinstated immediately . The crisis erupted in June when Zelaya -- despite congressional and supreme court decisions calling it illegal -- pushed forward with a plan to hold a referendum that could have led to changing the constitution to allow for additional presidential terms. The Supreme Court signed an arrest warrant for Zelaya but not to send him into exile. Now, the Supreme Court has three days to decide whether to ratify the charges and start a case against the military officers. Armed Forces spokesman Col. Ramiro Archaga said that the military respects the rule of law and are willing to appear before the justice system. The announcement of the arrest warrants came as U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Craig Kelly visited with the key players in the crisis in Honduras. Kelly met with Micheletti Wednesday, though details of the talks were unknown except for a statement from acting Honduran Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras, saying that calls for Micheletti's resignation were not part of the dialogue. Meanwhile, Zelaya remained holed up inside the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa. He has been there ever since sneaking back into the country in September. In another development, the Honduran congress was to take up the issue of amnesty for Zelaya and other players in the crisis next week. Journalist Elvin Sandoval contributed to this report.","NEW: Announcement of arrest warrants coincide with U.S. official's visit .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Charges have been dropped against four men accused of raping an 18-year-old student at Hofstra University after the woman recanted her allegations, prosecutors said. A Hofstra University student recanted her claims that she was lured to a dorm and assaulted in a bathroom stall. A judge dismissed all charges Wednesday night and ordered the release of the four men -- Jesus Ortiz, 19; Stalin Felipe, 19; Kevin Taveras, 20; and Rondell Bedward, 21; all of the New York metropolitan area, according to Nassau County, New York, District Attorney Kathleen Rice. They had been arrested, arraigned and jailed, with bail set at $500,000 each. Each was facing five counts of first-degree rape. ""Late this evening, during the continuation of the Nassau County Police Department's investigation of the allegation, and under questioning by my office's chief trial attorney and chief sex crimes prosecutor, the alleged victim of the sexual assault admitted that the encounter that took place early Sunday morning was consensual,"" Rice said. She said her office has launched a criminal investigation into the statements and reports given by the woman. The student had told Nassau County police that she had been lured from a club, forced into a men's bathroom at a university dormitory, bound and assaulted. The woman then called the university public safety office, which alerted local police. The reported rape shocked the Hofstra University community. The university had announced that it was increasing safety patrols on campus, as well as establishing a support hotline for students and parents.","Hofstra student who claimed she was gang-raped recants claims .

"(CNN) -- A raging blaze at a fuel storage complex in Puerto Rico lit up the night sky Friday near San Juan as firefighters battled to keep it from spreading further. iReporter Maria Marquez photographed the flames early Friday from the 17th floor of her San Juan condominium. Fifteen of the 40 tanks at the Caribbean Petroleum Corp. facility in the city of Bayamon were ablaze more than 19 hours after an explosion of unknown origin rocked the complex, Gov. Luis Fortuno said at an evening news conference. The governor had put the tally at 11 a few hours earlier. ""I don't think there's ever been a fire like this in Puerto Rico,"" Fire Lt. Jose Atorre told CNN affiliate WLII-TV. The fire started shortly after midnight, when at least one fuel tank exploded. Residents described a surreal scene after the blast woke them from their sleep and shattered windows miles away. ""I was in bed and all of a sudden heard this really horrible sound, so I ran upstairs and thought the whole town had blown up,"" said Teo Freytes, who filed an iReport for CNN. ""The explosion blew out windows here in Old San Juan,"" he said. ""It's still burning outrageously."" Others woke up Friday morning to an extremely unusual sight. ""I didn't expect to see a mushroom cloud from my house,"" said Justin Gehrke, a U.S. Army civilian employee who also filed an iReport. Fortuno said he declared a state of emergency for the area so Puerto Rico can get aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The storage and refinery complex sits near San Juan's bay, and Fortuno said officials are working to protect the water from being affected. ""We have serious worries that the bay or other bodies of water could be contaminated,"" he said. Caribbean Petroleum's Web site says the complex has storage facilities for gasoline and gasoline-related products. ""We have been monitoring the water visually and we have installed preventive pads and other material to contain a spill,"" said Pedro Nieves, chairman of the Puerto Rico Environmental Quality Board. ""No oil has reached the water."" But Nieves said that Caribbean Petroleum has a history of spills and ""there was potential that it had contaminated ground water."" He said he did not have any specifics on hand and that his organization was more focused on containing the current problem of fire and smoke. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency did not immediately return calls about the company's environmental history. Newspaper and TV reports said a 4-inch pipe from a lagoon on the complex was broken, preventing firefighters from using 2 million gallons of water from the lake to battle the blaze. About 150 area firefighters and 215 National Guard personnel were battling to keep the blaze from spreading. One person suffered smoke inhalation and was taken to a hospital, Fortuno said. At least 350 people were evacuated to a nearby stadium. iReport.com: See, share, send images of the explosion . The smoke can be toxic for people with breathing conditions and officials have asked nearby residents to stay away, the governor said. ""This is a tremendous amount of smoke, and fire contains all kinds of irritants and this is oil that is burning,"" said Mary Mears, spokeswoman for the Environmental Protection Agency region that includes Puerto Rico. ""It's smoke, so you're going to notice coughing, tearing, maybe a sore throat."" The wind shifted to the north Friday morning, blowing most of the smoke over less-populated areas and the Atlantic Ocean. The smoke plume also is rising 5,000 feet straight up before starting to drift, which keeps it away from people on the ground. ""The average air quality for Puerto Rico is still good,"" Nieves said. But the wind was expected to change Saturday morning, blowing the smoke over a large part of the island west of the fire. Officials also are concerned that rain mixed with the smoke could lead to acid rain. Authorities urged residents to bring in animals and their food and for people not to go out during or after any precipitation. The National Guard Combat Support Team was helping to monitor air quality and local environmental officials were working with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to install monitors near the blaze. Officials will investigate the cause of the blaze. Puerto Rico is a U.S. protectorate, which means federal officials are involved. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms sent a team of fire investigators, but have yet to determine whether the fire was an accident or set deliberately, said Orlando Felix, ATF Resident Agent in Charge of the Puerto Rico office. The FBI confirmed it is investigating graffiti found on two San Juan tunnels that referred to a fire. A spray-painted message on the two tunnels, less than three miles apart, said: ""Boom, fire, RIP, Gulf, Soul, ACNF."" ""We have found graffiti in two different locations,"" FBI Special Agent Harry Rodriguez told CNN. ""We are looking into the matter as part of this investigation with respect to the fire at the fuel-holding facility."" Rodriguez and San Juan police spokeswoman Maria Del Pilar Bon said they did not know what or who ACNF is. Caribbean Petroleum owns the Gulf Oil brand in Puerto Rico. Speaking at a news conference Friday afternoon, Fortuno said all leads must be followed. ""There could be many reasons [for the fire],"" he said. ""We're not going to guess. But there has to be an investigation."" Caribbean Petroleum, which owns 200 gas stations in Puerto Rico and several inland distribution facilities, supplies much of the island's fuel. But Department of Consumer Affairs Secretary Luis Rivera Marin said there is enough fuel on hand for 24 days, and 16 million gallons of gasoline were in transit to the island. He also froze prices at the level they were at 8:06 a.m. Officials transferred 295 inmates from a high-security prison in the area to other facilities, which they declined to identify for security purposes. Another 1,600 prisoners were moved from another nearby facility. Some 200 extra prison officials were brought in to handle the transfers, Fortuno said.  Watch iReporter's account of the blast and fire » . Video on WLII showed a caravan of white vans with sirens blaring transferring the prisoners, . San Juan police said they activated all units: explosives, transit, tactical operations and SWAT. Schools in Bayamon, San Juan, Toa Baja and Catano were closed, as was Puerto Rico Road 28. Roads 5 and 22 were partially closed. Flights in and out of Luis Munoz Marin International Airport in San Juan were not affected, an airport official told CNN.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Fourteen Americans died in two helicopter crashes in Afghanistan on Monday, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said: 10 in one incident and four in the other. Three Drug Enforcement Administration special agents were among the dead, according to the DEA, which did not identify them. The agents were first DEA agents to be killed in Afghanistan. ""Like all those who give their lives in service to America, they were doing their duty, and they were doing this nation proud,"" President Obama said at the Naval Air Station in Jacksonville, Florida. ""Now, it is our duty, as a nation, to keep their memory alive in our hearts and to carry on their work, to take care of their families, to keep our country safe,"" Obama said. It was the largest number of Americans killed in Afghanistan in a single day in more than four years, according to CNN records. The NATO force ruled out enemy fire in the crash that killed four Americans and said enemy action was not thought to be the cause of the other. A helicopter went down in the west of the country after a raid on suspected drug traffickers. Seven U.S. service members and three U.S. civilians were killed, according to an ISAF statement. Fourteen Afghan service members, 11 U.S. service members and one U.S. civilian were injured in the crash. Monday's crash marked the second-deadliest incident in the agency's 36-year history, according to entries on the DEA's Web site. The deadliest incident for the DEA occurred August 27, 1994, when a plane carrying five special agents crashed in the Peruvian Andes during a reconnaissance mission, according to the DEA's Web site. One of Monday's helicopter crashes occurred after the helicopter was returning from a raid on a compound, ISAF said. The joint international security force killed more than a dozen enemy fighters while searching the compound, ISAF said. The site was thought to harbor insurgents tied to narcotics trafficking in western Afghanistan. The militants were killed in a firefight when insurgents confronted the joint force. As the force was leaving, a helicopter ""went down due to unconfirmed reasons,"" ISAF said. A recovery operation was launched. DEA Acting Administrator Michele Leonhart said the crash occurred as the agents and seven U.S. service members were returning ""from a completed, joint counternarcotics mission."" ""DEA is an extremely tight family, and the death of these three brave agents is a devastating loss for us,"" she said in a written statement. Attorney General Eric Holder said the circumstances of the crash were under investigation. ""I want to express my deepest condolences to the families of these heroic agents,"" Holder said in a written statement. ""During this difficult time, the families of these agents are foremost in our thoughts and prayers."" In Monday's other deadly crash, four U.S. service members were killed when two helicopters apparently collided in the air in southern Afghanistan. Two other NATO service members were injured. ""The incident is currently being investigated, but it is confirmed that hostile fire was not involved,"" ISAF said. ""Each and every death is a tremendous loss for the family and friends of each service member and civilian. Our grief is compounded when we have such a significant loss on one day,"" Col. Wayne Shanks, an ISAF spokesman, said in a written statement. ISAF is not announcing the names of the dead or which branch of the service they were in, pending the notification of their relatives. The DEA has had a presence in Afghanistan for four years. The agency said Monday that it is increasing its presence in Kabul to up to about 50 agents.

"(CNN) -- An interview with a choreographer for the Miss Universe pageant spurred controversy Wednesday over alleged claims that Donald Trump personally selects some of the finalists. Donald Trump is at the center of a brewing controversy over the Miss Universe finalists. The Q&A with Michael Schwandt, which appeared on Guanabee.com, quotes him as saying that ""it's just kind of common knowledge that [Trump] picks six of the top 15 single-handedly."" ""And, his reason for doing so, as he told me and he's told the girls before, is that he left it all up to preliminary judging in the past, and some of the most beautiful women, in his opinion, were not in the top 15, and he was kind of upset about that,"" the story quotes Schwandt as saying. ""And he decided that he would pick a certain number and let the judges pick a certain number."" Via e-mail, Schwandt said that he ""was speaking in hypothetical jest"" when he said Trump picks some of the finalists and said the mogul has never spoken to either him, or any of his team, about the selection process. ""The story posted on that site contains many misquotes and [is] highly inaccurate,"" Schwandt wrote. ""I would like to disassociate myself from it completely and anything negative in regards to Miss Universe or even suggesting that Donald Trump 'rigs' his event. I'm perplexed as to why Guanabee.com would run a story such as this when they are aware that it is inaccurate."" Daniel Mauser, publisher of Guanabee, said his site stands by the story, which resulted after Schwandt was contacted about his role choreographing both the pageant and a much talked-about performance by reality-star-turned-singer Heidi Montag. ""Whatever you see quoted in the article is verbatim what he said,"" Mauser said. ""So I can understand why he would want to retract those words, but unfortunately that was what was said."" A statement from Miss Universe Organization President Paula M. Shugart, released Wednesday, said that ""to suggest the pageant is somehow orchestrated or 'rigged' is utterly false and misleading."" However, the statement also observed that Trump does play a role in selecting the finalists. ""In the 2009 Miss Universe competition, a preliminary panel of judges selected nine of the Top 15 and members of the Miss Universe Organization, including owner Donald J. Trump, selected the remaining six,"" the statement began. The statement went on to say that ""a separate panel of judges, introduced live at the Finals telecast, is solely responsible for the selection of the Top 10, Top 5 and the ultimate winner of the pageant."" ""This system has been in place since 2005 and has always been fully disclosed to the contestants, their directors, the judges and the viewing audience,"" the statement said. ""The procedure is overseen by the accounting firm of Ernst & Young and NBC Program Standards and Compliance. To in any way call into question the integrity of the judging process or suggest the pageant is somehow orchestrated or 'rigged' is utterly false and misleading."" Mauser describes Guanabee as an ""entertainment Web site for the Hispanic community that covers the interests and portrayals of acculturated Hispanics in this country."" The Miss Universe pageant is very popular in the Hispanic community, Mauser said, and the story took a different turn after the alleged comments were published. Schwandt, who has choreographed the pageant for the past few years, said in an e-mail to CNN that although Trump does meet with the contestants before the televised pageant, as far as he knows, it is just a gesture on Trump's part in his role as producer of the pageant. ""I know the Miss Universe Organization goes to great lengths to establish a preliminary and final panel of judges as well as different factors on which contestants are judged,"" Schwandt wrote. ""However, I'm the last person to be quoted as saying anything in regard to the judging or selecting process, I'm the choreographer, I deal with that.""","Miss Universe choreographer's interview sparks controversy .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- The world may soon know for sure where Spanish poet and playwright Federico Garcia Lorca rests after fascists executed him in 1936 during Spain's Civil War. A team from the Andalucia Geophysics Institut at work in the Federico Garcia Lorca Park, Spain. Officials in southern Spain Friday cleared the last legal hurdle to permit exhuming a mass grave site in a village near Granada where Lorca and some other Civil War victims are thought to be buried, CNN partner station CNN+ reported. The area has been fenced off for weeks as scientists conducted preparatory work. Next Monday (October 19) they are due to erect a large tent over the site so that exhumation can be conducted confidentially, said Andalusia regional government justice councilor Begona Alvarez, CNN+ reported from Granada. The potential exhumation of Lorca is part of a broader effort in Spain that already has resulted in various mass graves being dug up and could lead to thousands of other Spaniards still thought to be in mass graves. Many were killed by right-wing forces loyal to General Francisco Franco, who won the three-year long Civil War, which began in 1936. Franco went on to rule Spain with an iron fist until his death in 1975. For years, Lorca descendants have argued that Lorca -- whose poems and plays are widely studied at universities, including his ""Poet in New York"" -- should not be exhumed, mainly so that he would not be seen as more important than the many other Civil War victims thought to be in nearby mass graves. In a statement earlier this month, Lorca descendants noted the complexity of the issue, because relatives of some others thought to be in the gravesite have requested their removal, identification, and permission to bury their remains in hometown cemeteries. In their October 2 statement, six Lorca descendants reiterated their request that Lorca's presumed remains not be disturbed. But they also reserved the right to have them identified in the future, and they asked authorities to designate the current mass grave site as a legally defined resting place. It is already a park, in the village of Alfacar, because that's where it's long been thought that Lorca, captured by Franco loyalists early in the Civil War, was shot dead, according to historians who interviewed witnesses and local villagers. Relatives of a bullfighter, Francisco Galadi, a tax inspector, Fermin Roldan and a restaurant owner, Miguel Cobo, have asked authorities to identify their remains, officials said. But in the case of teacher Dioscoro Galindo, also executed and thought to be in the mass grave, two of his nieces are at odds over whether to exhume him or not, so officials will not act until that family reaches a common position, CNN+ reported. Irish author Ian Gibson, who is a leading scholar on Lorca, told CNN last year, ""Lorca is the most famous victim of the Civil War. I think Lorca can be a symbol for reconciliation of the Civil War."" Spanish parliament in 2007, led by the Socialist government, passed a law condemning Franco's dictatorship and calling on town halls to fund initiatives to unearth mass graves. It also sought to honor Roman Catholic clergy and others executed by the losing side in the war, the forces loyal to the leftist Republican government. Since then, some prominent statutes of Franco have been removed from public view, but others remain, along with numerous streets in Spain named for Franco or his top generals. More recently, there have been efforts to try to exhume presumed Franco victims from a mass grave at his large mausoleum site, the Valley of the Fallen, just outside of Madrid, where Franco himself is buried.","Resting place of Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca may soon be known .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Indian government doctors Thursday eased the protruding heart of a 10-day-old baby boy back into his body in what they called a critical but successful surgery. Surgeons in New Dehli, India, operate on a 10-day-old baby whose heart was outside his chest. A.K. Bisoi, cardiothoracic surgeon at New Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences, told CNN that his 13-member team did not stop the child's heartbeat as they performed the 3½-hour operation. The dangling organ has been successfully placed in a space surgically created between the chest and the abdomen, he said. ""The baby is stable. He may not require any other surgery,"" Bisoi said. Nonetheless, the doctors will keep him under observation and will not comment on when he can be discharged. Bisoi explained that surgeons had to displace organs including the lungs and the liver as they created a space for the heart. ""We will have to keep a watch on how those organs respond,"" he said.  Watch more on the surgery » . The baby was born August 25 in a remote village in India's eastern state of Bihar along the border with Nepal. He was admitted to the hospital the next day with acute dehydration and infection that doctors say he probably caught during a 683-mile (1,100-kilometer) journey in a rickety train compartment. Specialists replaced the baby's infected blood and covered his heart with a synthetic membrane. Bisoi described the case -- called ectopia cordis, which only affects five to eight cases in 1 million live births -- as a ""lifetime opportunity"" that might shed light on how to deal with similar conditions in the future. ""You are daring to correct a defect of Mother Nature,"" he told CNN a day ahead of the surgery. All India Institute of Medical Sciences, a state-run hospital, carried out the operation free of cost. The child's 24-year-old father, Chander Majhi, is a laborer in Bihar, one of India's most impoverished states. He said he felt indebted to the doctor in his home state as well as the hospital specialists. The Bihar doctor had not only referred the baby to the hospital but also financed the trip.","Surgeons in India create space for dangling heart between chest and abdomen .

"(CNN) -- Sometimes it seems like Barack Obama rules the Internet. President Obama speaks during a town hall meeting on health care in August. The president's Twitter feed is hugely popular, with more than 2 million followers. Funny White House photos of the first family wearing 3-D glasses went viral after the White House posted them to Flickr. And he's the first president who commonly addresses the nation on YouTube. Many pundits have argued Obama's mastery of online social networks and his image as a BlackBerry-addicted, tech-hip person helped win him the U.S. presidency in January. So if the Obama Administration is so Internet savvy, what's happening with health care? As the country's messy debate about health care reform continues, some online observers are starting to wonder if Obama has lost his grip on Internet discourse. They're also wondering if it's possible for any one person -- no matter how powerful -- to control public dialogue on a medium like the Internet, where conversations are driven by millions of users instead of TV pundits and heads of state. The health care fight is the first time the U.S. has had a major policy debate where all sides are represented and haggling openly online, said Joe Trippi, author of ""The Revolution Will Not Be Televised: Democracy, the Internet, and the Overthrow of Everything."" Obama's success at mobilizing grass-roots support through online networks has inspired Republicans and interests groups to do the same, he said. That may give the impression that Obama is losing control of his online base, but it really means more people are conversing online, he said. ""You're definitely seeing a diversity of voices and a diversity of opinions [online] that I think is due to Obama's success,"" said Trippi, a longtime Democratic campaign strategist. ""It's the great awakening. People realized they need to do that too."" Partly because of the vastness of opinion and discussion online, it's difficult for the Obama administration, or any single group, to control the health care debate, said David All, founder of TechRepublican.com. All said Democrats have made a number of ""online gaffes"" that have drawn attention away from their talking points. He said there is ""so much noise"" in the health care debate online that the party's missteps are overshadowing its message. For example, the White House raised privacy concerns after it asked people to send the administration e-mails and online writings that spread misinformation about health care reform, he said. Still, Obama remains active on many social networks -- from Twitter to Facebook to the video-sharing site Vimeo. And some people say he's still doing a fine job at being an up-to-date online communicator. Mark Milian, a staff writer for the Los Angeles Times who has written about Obama and social media, said Obama's online communications fell off when he first took office. But he says the president has rebounded online during the health care debate and is doing a good job of reaching constituents through that medium. But that doesn't mean he's the only one talking online. In trying to get their message across, administration officials have ""just as good a shot as some 20-year-old college student from Chicago,"" he said. ""It's just they have more people behind that issue. They have a greater pull."" Some have criticized the online community and Internet spin-masters for creating, and spreading, disinformation about proposals for health care reform. On the whole, though, the Internet conversation about the subject is healthy in part because so much information is available, said Bill Adair, editor of PolitiFact.com, a nonpartisan site that fact-checks political statements. ""People have access now to more information than ever before and that's generally a very positive thing,"" he said. ""Although the Internet can be used to spread a lot of false things, it's also never been easier for journalists like myself to debunk these things, you know? So on balance, the reality is we just have a whole new dimension to the national discussion on any topic and that has positives and negatives."" He encouraged people to check out statements made by bloggers, Twitter users or e-mailers before considering them fact. Prevailing images of the recent health care debate have been of constituents screaming at their legislators in a series of town hall meetings held around the county. Bernhard Drax, who has reported on health care meetings in the virtual world of Second Life, said conversations online have the potential to be much more civil and productive than those real-world town halls. ""Social media could drown them out with reason, with substance,"" he said. ""My idealistic view is that social media in general, including virtual worlds, can drown out that angry shouting."" Daniel Palestrant, CEO of Sermo, an online social network for doctors, said Internet discussions tend to be ahead of those in the real world. Tort reform, he said, wouldn't be in the public conversation if not for the fact that people can bring up that issue up on the Web. He added that medical associations claim to represent physicians but often don't portray the nuances of peoples' views. The Internet lets people speak for themselves, he said. Trippi, the campaign consultant, said the shouting matches at health care town halls expose the limitations of online discourse today. But he said online debates and discussions will play increasingly important roles in public policy discussions. ""All these new tools are still just in their infancy and they're still being used to a large extent just like everything else is used,"" he said. ""But I don't think that will hold. I think you're starting to see people actually talking to each other.""","Some say the Obama administration may be losing its Internet savvy .
Others argue that more interest groups are online now, resulting in more noise .

"(CNN) -- The U.N.'s forest carbon scheme which has formed part of the negotiations at the climate talks in Copenhagen has been one of the few areas where countries are broadly in agreement. The U.N.'s REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries) program is a collaboration between the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and Environmental (UNEP) and Development (UNDP) programs. Yemi Katerere, head of the U.N.-REDD program explained to CNN how the REDD program proposals would work. ""In theory REDD is a system to provide incentives for countries not to cut their forests,"" Katerere said. ""The incentive system is essentially that your trees are worth more standing than they are cut. You get a reward for not cutting your forests."" The idea is straightforward; If the function of rainforests -- capturing carbon, water catchment, weather regulators and biodiversity -- is recognized their value will rise. The destruction of the world's rainforests is estimated to contribute to as much as 20 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions. REDD envisages a situation whereby ""different services can be marketed and paid for, boosting the incomes of other wise marginalized communities"". Many pilot schemes are already underway. Back in 1997 when the Kyoto Protocol was adopted, the part rainforests play in carbon storage wasn't recognized. Proposals to reduce emissions from deforestation were first introduced by the governments of Papua New Guinea in December 2005 at the COP11 talks in Canada. Talks at Copenhagen are hoping to build on the progress made since. REDD say that more than 30 models of how the program should work have been put forward by countries, groups of countries and NGOs. Katerere wouldn't be drawn on the outcome of negotiations at Copenhagen when CNN spoke to him on Thursday. Critics of the REDD program argue that it allows richer countries to meet -- to buy essentially -- some of their emissions obligations without cutting them at all. Others argue trying to measure what is being preserved and how much carbon is being stored will prove incredibly hard to quantify. But Katerere said an imperfect program which can be improved is better than none at all. ""We should stop focusing on the negatives issues of REDD and start looking at the positives. In the short term, REDD offers use the greatest mitigation potential at an affordable price and is the most cost effective.""","U.N.-REDD program has received widespread support from countries at Copenhagen talks .

"Washington (CNN) -- Despite revelations in a congressional investigation of a subsidiary's mismanagement and questionable vetting of employees, the company formerly known as Blackwater could soon win millions of dollars in new job orders for work in Afghanistan. A subsidiary of Xe, the new name for Blackwater, is eligible to win Department of Defense work worth tens of millions of dollars to train Afghan police, according to a Pentagon official. Five companies were qualified to bid on the training and training-support contracts, including Raytheon, Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin Integrated Systems, ARINC and the U.S. Training Center. U.S. Training Center is a subsidiary company owned by Xe. The Pentagon contract is to be announced next month. Xe has not been officially notified whether it will be awarded the contract, according to a company spokesman. ""We have not been awarded either and have no knowledge of the status of those contracts,"" said Xe spokesman Mark Corallo. An industry official told CNN that Xe made bids on two task orders under the training program, one for the actual training of Afghan police and one for logistics support for such training. Once awarded, the new orders would be in effect until August 2012, according to a Department of Defense statement. Since 2007, the company, then called Blackwater, has held the rights to bid against the other four companies on a pool of jobs worth as much as $15 billion. Xe still holds numerous contracts under three company names in Afghanistan for support of military and intelligence operations. Those companies are US Training Center, Greystone and Presidential Airways. The company has a troubled past both in Iraq and Afghanistan. It was banned from operating in Iraq by the government there after a shooting incident left Iraqi civilians dead and injured. That incident strained relations between the United States and Iraq. In May 2009, four contractors in Kabul were involved in a shooting incident that left two Afghan civilians dead. Two of the contractors are now facing charges in the United States. A congressional investigation found evidence that the company that hired them, a Xe subsidiary called Paravant, armed the employees despite having no permission to do so from the U.S. military. The probe also found that the company illicitly obtained the guns used in the shooting, and hundreds of others, from a stockpile of weapons meant for the use of the Afghan military and police. On Wednesday Xe officials were called before the Senate Armed Service Committee to discuss that shooting incident. The committee's chairman, Carl Levin, D-Michigan, said an Army investigation appeared to find that the contract personnel had ""violated alcohol consumption policies, were not authorized to possess weapons, violated use-of-force rules and violated movement-control policies."" He said one of the keys to beating the Taliban in Afghanistan is the ability of U.S. forces to win support from the Afghan people, many of whom do not distinguish between U.S. contractors and the U.S. military. Xe Services Vice President Fred Roitz acknowledged the company's culpability in the 2009 incident in his opening statement to the panel. In the statement, Roitz said, ""the new Xe Services would act differently today. We simply will not send our personnel overseas without a proper authorization for a weapon (where needed) and without full compliance with all requirements."" He said the company has ""put in place new leadership and procedures to help ensure this commitment is kept."" On Thursday, Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell defended the military's oversight of contractors. ""We've made a lot of mistakes in both Iraq and Afghanistan. And we've tried to address those mistakes in a number of ways,"" Morrell said. ""But as far as I know, people are being held to account for the mistakes and the violations that they have made.""","A subsidiary of Xe, formerly Blackwater, bid on lucrative new training contract .

"New York (CNN) -- New York's Commission on Public Integrity is charging Gov. David Paterson with an ethics violation for accepting free tickets to the first game of last year's World Series, the commission said Wednesday. Paterson violated the state's restriction on gifts for public officials in October when he sought free tickets to the game in Yankee Stadium between the New York Yankees and the Philadelphia Phillies, the commission said. The commission also said Paterson lied under oath about intending to pay for the tickets. The governor's office said it was reviewing the commission's findings. ""Governor Paterson maintains his innocence and intends to challenge the findings of the commission both with respect to the law and the facts,"" the office said. ""The governor takes this matter very seriously and intends to fully cooperate with any further inquiries or investigations, but believes the commission has acted unfairly in this matter."" The governor could face an $80,000 fine for violating the state's gift ban for public officials and up to $10,000 if he is found to have used his official position to secure unwarranted privileges. The commission has asked New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo and the Albany County district attorney to investigate whether Paterson or ""anyone else"" committed a crime during the governor's interview with the commission and by causing a check to be back-dated. Paterson, who announced last week that he would not run for election to a full term, has faced controversy since news reports charged that his aide was involved in a domestic violence incident with a woman and that state police later allegedly pressured her to keep quiet. The aide, David Johnson, has been suspended without pay. Paterson has asked Cuomo, a possible contender for the governor's office, to investigate the matter. Johnson was among the four guests who attended the October 28 game with Paterson, the Commission on Public Integrity said. He also was involved in obtaining the tickets, which cost $425 a piece, from the Yankees, the commission said in its notice of reasonable cause. According to the commission, the governor testified that he decided he should attend Game One of the World Series and directed Johnson to get tickets from the Yankees. The governor told his aide that the request should include tickets for his son, Alex, and his son's friend. Johnson then told the governor's scheduler, Matthew Nelson, to contact the Yankees about five or six tickets. Johnson said Paterson would be attending in a ""ceremonial capacity."" Based on Johnson's representation, the commission said, ""the Yankees did not expect payment for any tickets because the tickets were for official business."" They had requested a letter from the governor's counsel confirming that, and the counsel had sent a letter saying so, the commission said. The Yankees said they require such confirmation or payment when public officials request tickets, the commission said. However, the commission said, the governor did not participate in opening ceremonies for the game and was not announced to the crowd. He also did not meet with first lady Michelle Obama and Vice President Joe Biden's wife, Jill Biden, who attended the game, or members of the Yankees organization, the commission said. In testimony, the governor said he always intended to pay for the tickets for his son and his son's friend. He said he had taken a check to the game for the tickets, filling out the date and the $850 but leaving the payee section blank. ""While he had no opportunity to pay while at the stadium, the governor testified that he gave the check to Johnson and asked him to send the check to the Yankees,"" the commission said. However, the commission said that it had compared the handwriting on the check with that of the governor's handwriting on other documents and that the governor did not write the check sent to the Yankees. ""The handwriting on the check that Johnson forwarded to the Yankees as payment for his ticket to Game One reveals that the same person who wrote and signed the governor's check also wrote and signed Johnson's check,"" the commission said. The check Paterson said he wrote is dated October 27, the day before Game One, the commission said, although the governor said he had written the check on the day of the game. In its notice of of reasonable cause, the commission also cited testimony from the governor's communications director, Peter Kauffmann, whom a New York Post reporter had asked about payment for the tickets. Kauffmann said that he had discussed the game several times with Paterson and Johnson and that the governor indicated to him that Yankees President Randy Levine, a law school classmate of Paterson's, had invited Paterson to the game, the commission said. ""During this conversation, the governor said nothing to Kauffmann about his intention to pay for the tickets for his son or his son's friend, nor did the governor mention anything about having previously written a check for $850 and giving it to Johnson as payment to the Yankees,"" the commission said. The reporter later told Kauffmann that the Yankees disputed Paterson's account, saying Levine had never invited the governor to the game, the commission said. Kauffmann confronted the governor, who ""then conceded to Kauffmann that Levine had not explicitly invited him to Game One,"" the commission said. The commission also said the governor and his son attended last year's Opening Day at Yankee Stadium and at Citi Field, where the New York Mets play. ""The governor testified that he did not pay for his ticket or his son's ticket"" for either event, the commission said.","New York ethics panel says governor accepted free World Series tickets .
He lied under oath about intending to pay for tickets, commission says .
Governor maintains his innocence, his office says .
He could be hit with fines for violating ethics restrictions ."
"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Two George Washington Bridge security guards photographed sleeping on the job have been fired, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Two George Washington Bridge guards were fired for their on-the-job siestas. A bicycle tour operator who commutes daily over the bridge from New Jersey to New York snapped photos of the two guards on different occasions, and the photos were published on a New Jersey local news Web site. In one set of photographs by commuter Joey Lepore, taken during a Wednesday rush hour at 7:15 a.m., a guard tilts his head downward and dozes. The other snoozer's on-the-clock siesta is more brazen: he uses his arm as a pillow as he dozes at 10:15 a.m. last Monday. Before releasing the photos, Lepore hesitated, knowing it would likely cost the guards their jobs. But ultimately he decided the security of thousands outweighed the job security of two. ""If there's two people on this bridge who don't care about my safety and the safety of anybody who comes over this bridge, then I really don't have an obligation to withhold what I have,"" he said. Given the George Washington Bridge's iconic status and huge traffic volume, officials have long cited it as a potential terrorist target. Lepore said he was moved to photograph the slumbering sentries after witnessing the same guard napping on three occasions. ""The first time I shrugged it off and said, 'I can't believe he's sleeping,'"" said Lepore. ""The second time I was very annoyed. Third time -- that's it."" Lepore said he later approached the guard, told him he had caught him asleep at his post three times, and said he had the photos to prove it. The profusely apologetic guard vowed it would not happen again. Three weeks later, it did happen again, but this time with a different guard, according to Lepore. Instead of discreetly taking photos from a distance, an indignant Lepore marched up to the guard's booth and snapped away. The guard did not stir. The sleeping guards were employees of FJC Security, a security contractor used by the Port Authority, which operates the George Washington Bridge along with all other bridges leading into Manhattan. In a statement, the Port Authority sought to assure commuters it views security as an issue of utmost importance, and urged people to report holes they notice in its defenses. ""The Port Authority takes the safety of its passengers and facilities very seriously and has spent more than $4 billion on security since 9/11. The Port Authority welcomes the public's vigilance on matters of safety and security and we encourage our customers to contact us if they encounter anything out of the ordinary,"" the agency said. Although the guards' names were not released, the Port Authority said in its statement, ""The two guards have been fired by the security contractor, FJC Security."" FJC Security did not respond to CNN's calls for comment. Fran Townsend, a CNN contributor and former Bush homeland security adviser, called the guards' naps a serious lapse. ""It is unacceptable, particularly given the experience the Port Authority had with 9/11,"" she said, referring to the Port Authority's role as the operator of the World Trade Center.","George Washington Bridge guards lose jobs after being caught napping on duty .

"Santiago, Chile (CNN) -- U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon arrived Friday in earthquake-damaged Chile, which endured two more strong aftershocks while working to recover from last week's devastating earthquake and tsunami. ""I'm here to express [the] solidarity of the United Nations, of the international community, to the people and government of Chile,"" Ban told reporters at the airport in the capital, Santiago. ""I know that this is one of the worst natural disasters in recent history of Chile; at the same time, I'm very moved to see such strong courage and fortitude and resilience of Chilean people,"" Ban said. Earlier, shortly before 9 a.m. Friday, an aftershock with a magnitude of 6.6 struck the area, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The aftershock followed another with a 6.0 magnitude, the survey said. The two are the latest in scores of aftershocks that have hit after the massive magnitude 8.8 earthquake and subsequent tsunami Saturday.  Full coverage of Chile's earthquake . Friday's aftershocks did not cause any known injuries or damage, Chile's National Emergency Office said, and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Tsunami Center did not issue any warnings. The tsunami and 8.8 magnitude earthquake -- the fifth-strongest worldwide since 1900 -- killed hundreds of people and toppled buildings, particularly in the Maule region along the coast. Shocking scenes hours after quake . Roads were torn up and power was cut off in many areas. Thousands have been left homeless. Food, water and the restoration of basic services, such as electricity, are top priorities, said the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Human Affairs. The Chilean government, which is leading the rescue and relief efforts, has asked the United Nations for items such as field hospitals with surgical facilities, dialysis centers, generators, satellite phones, structural damage evaluation systems, saltwater purifying systems, mobile bridges and field kitchens. Ban said Friday that he will talk to Chilean President Michelle Bachelet and President-elect Sebastian Pinera about how the United Nations can best help. Pinera, a conservative billionaire businessman, takes office next week. The secretary-general said he will visit hard-hit Concepcion to assess the damage and will bring the matter to the United Nations. ""Now it is time for the United Nations and international community to stand with the Chilean people and government,"" he said, after noting the Chileans' generosity in helping Haiti after its 7.0 earthquake on January 12. That quake flattened much of the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, and killed hundreds of thousands of people. A 24-hour telethon, ""Chile Helps Chile,"" which organizers hope will raise $27 million for earthquake victims, was scheduled for Friday. Residents in devastated Constitucion expressed a determination to rebuild. ""It very hard, but it's not impossible. We have to be strong; we have to reinvent ourselves,"" said resident Antonieta Biachi. ""You have to start from scratch; there is no other option."" Though he is not yet in office, Pinera has named six officials to lead recovery efforts. More than 13,000 soldiers and other military personnel have been dispatched to restore order in the earthquake-damaged area. Food and water began to arrive earlier this week in Concepcion, and officials said they distributed 3,500 aid packages Wednesday. But many residents have complained that federal aid has been slow to arrive. A six-member U.S. Agency for International Development disaster response team has been sent to Chile to assist with relief effort, said State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley. The team should arrive Saturday, he said. A USAID contractor also is embedded with the Chilean National Emergency Response Office, the country's equivalent of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency. The United States sent 71 satellite phones, plastic sheeting and two mobile water treatment units, the U.S. State Department said. Six more water treatment units are to arrive within a week. A field hospital and two C-130 aircraft to assist with moving supplies around the country have also been deployed. The United States also sent $1 million to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to aid their efforts. Bachelet toured parts of central and southern Chile on Thursday. She visited Talcahuano, where the tsunami roared through many parts of the seaport town. Bachelet also toured Talca, the capital of Maule. ""This is the time for action,"" she said later Thursday on returning to Santiago, where she met leaders of the Catholic Church, a partner in providing help in the quake's aftermath. The top priority remained the needs of survivors, followed by reconstruction efforts, Bachelet said. Chile has announced three days of national mourning beginning Sunday. Every house has been authorized to hang the national flag in memory of those who perished. The death toll was revised downward Thursday as authorities reviewed discrepancies in the reported number of dead in the Maule region. The casualty count there included more than 200 people who are missing but not confirmed dead, said Deputy Interior Minister Patricio Rosende. Therefore, the official nationwide death toll is lower than the 802 figure given by emergency authorities. To limit confusion, Rosende read aloud the names of 279 Chileans who had been killed and identified by Thursday evening. He said would update that official number regularly. The new tally does not account for hundreds of unidentified victims. With disasters of this magnitude, ""the number of dead change daily,"" Rosende said. ""It takes months sometimes to compile the information, because one of the biggest problems in the affected areas is the lack of precision and uncertainty at the scene."" Despite the disaster, the Chilean Davis Cup tennis team will open competition Saturday in Coquimbo, Chile, against Israel. Team officials and players said they would be playing in honor of quake victims. ""It will be difficult, but we will do our best for our country,"" said player Fernando Gonzalez. CNN's Brian Byrnes, Sara Sidner, David Ariosto, Elise Labott, and Karl Penhaul contributed to this report.","Ban Ki-moon arrives to meet leaders, survey damage .

"(CNN) -- Aftershocks rattled southern Taiwan in the hours after a magnitude 6.4 earthquake shook the island, but left it relatively unscathed. Thursday morning's quake was followed by more than 15 aftershocks, the largest reaching 4.8. Taiwan's interior ministry reported 12 minor injuries -- nine in Kaohsiung county, two in Jia Yi county and one in Tainan county. The quake struck about 8:20 a.m. (7:20 p.m. Wednesday ET) in a mountainous region about 25 miles northwest of Taitung, on the southeast coast, and 40 miles east of Tainan and Kaohsiung on the southwest coast. The region includes Taiwan's Maolin National Scenic Area and is still recovering from a direct hit by Typhoon Morakot that killed hundreds in August. The typhoon dumped more than two feet of rain, causing serious mudslides in the south, including one that buried the village of Shiao Lin under 50 feet of mud. Shuo Hong, an orthopedic surgeon in Taipei, about 155 miles away from the epicenter, felt the earthquake during a meeting at a hospital. ""We were debating whether or not to run for shelter, but the hospital is safe,"" he said ""It is built to resist a 7.0-magnitude earthquake. ""It was shaking for about 20 to 30 seconds, shaking more than what we expected,"" Hong said. Were you there? Did you feel it? The Taiwan Ministry of Interior and the National Fire Agency said electricity was cut off in parts of Kaohsiung county, Jia Yi city and Jia Yi county. Taiwan's official news agency reported that a fire broke out in Jia Yi city. Residents in southern Taiwan reported cracks in some buildings and major bridges. Train service was also disrupted in some areas, Taiwanese media reported. Two small hotels near the epicenter that were contacted by CNN reported no damage, though the buildings shook for a few seconds during the quake. Albert Yu, communications manager of the humanitarian organization World Vision, told CNN he was about half-way through a 90-minute trip via high-speed train from Taipei to Tainan when the quake struck. Passengers did not feel the quake, he said, but operators stopped the train and announced what had happened before inspecting the tracks for stability. During the delay, Yu said people were calm, ""opening laptops ... and chatting with people around them."" Yu said World Vision ""has already been on high alert responding to the quakes in Haiti and Chile, so we're closely monitoring reports in the earthquake in southern Taiwan."" Residents in Taipei, the capital, also felt the shaking. Earthquakes are far from uncommon on the nearly 14,000-square-mile island -- about the size of the U.S. states of Maryland and Delaware combined -- which sits across the juncture of the Eurasian and Philippine tectonic plates. A 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck the same general region in December. The island took a double hit on December 26, 2006, when earthquakes of 7.1 and 6.9 magnitude hit eight minutes apart. The largest recorded quake to strike Taiwan was an 8.0-magnitude quake in 1920, but the worst earthquake disaster stemmed from a 7.1-magnitude quake in 1935 that killed more than 3,200 people -- followed by a 6.5-magnitude quake that killed more than 2,700 people three months later. More recently, a 7.6-magnitude earthquake killed more than 2,400 people in 1999.

"(CNN) -- Motor Sport's governing body, the FIA, have formally confirmed the entry list for the 2010 Formula One season -- with potential newcomers US F1 omitted from the grid. The financially-troubled team had asked the FIA if they could miss the first four races of the season in order to attract extra sponsorship, but have instead been told that they must re-apply if they are to be on the grid for the following season. The official entry list shows 12 teams and 24 drivers -- two teams more than last season. Three new teams are lining up -- Lotus, Virgin Racing and Hispania Racing -- with Toyota deciding to leave the sport. There are also two team name changes. Last year's winning constructor's Brawn GP have been taken over by Mercedes, while BMW Sauber have reverted back to being the Sauber team, although they have to retain the BMW title for this season due to legal obligations. Meanwhile, there is also no place on the grid for the proposed Serbian-backed Stefan GP team, who had been hoping to gain a late entry in place of US F1. An official FIA statement read: ""The US F1 Team have indicated they will not be in a position to participate in the 2010 FIA Formula One world championship. ""Having considered the various options, the FIA confirms it is not possible for a replacement team to be entered for the championship at this late stage. ""In the coming days the FIA will announce details of a new selection process to identify candidates to fill any vacancies existing at the start of the 2011 season."" US F1 have faced a race against time to have their car ready for the grid, after a number of sponsors opted to pull out the project. Production of the car had been stopped with the team struggling to pay wages, resulting in a number of staff choosing to leave. Team principal Ken Anderson is yet to comment on whether he will attempt to make the grid for the 2011 season. The decision leaves Argentinian Jose Maria Lopez, who had already been offered a drive with US F1, without a team. Tuesday also saw the final driver appointment confirmed, with Karun Chandhok becoming the second Indian to compete in the sport having been named by Hispania Racing. The 26-year-old follows in the footsteps of Narain Karthikeyan, who had one season with Jordan in 2005. There will be four world champions on the grid; Jenson Button, Lewis Hamilton, Michael Schumacher and Fernando Alonso, while 11 of the 24 drivers have experienced winning a grand prix.

"(CNN) -- There wasn't a cloud in the sky early Friday when Dave Samuels trained his telescopes at the moon, hoping to catch a glimpse of a NASA rocket striking the lunar landscape. The moon, shown shortly before NASA's rockets hit on Friday morning. ""We saw nothing,"" he said. Samuels is vice president of the Fremont Peak Observatory near Monterey, California, which had invited members of the public to watch Friday's NASA mission through its telescopes. The lunar strike happened shortly after 4:30 a.m. on the West Coast (7:30 a.m. ET). NASA had encouraged everyone around the country to host ""impact parties,"" saying the plume of dust generated by the lunar impact would be visible through ""mid-sized backyard"" telescopes 10 inches or larger. It said the chances of seeing the plume were greater for people living in areas that were still dark. The space agency even posted an interactive map on its Web site so people could find ""a public event near you."" NASA officials had said the impact of the Centaur upper-stage rocket would result in plumes of dust of more than 250 metric tons. After it hit, the debris was analyzed by a satellite -- launched along with the rocket -- that traveled through the dust cloud before its own impact on the moon. The goal of the $79 million mission was to determine whether  there is water on the moon. After the impact, NASA officials called the mission a success, saying the satellite sent back a good amount of data that now will be analyzed. Jennifer Stracener of Vilonia, Arkansas, said she got up early to watch NASA's live telecast of the impact. She was disappointed, and posted her reaction on CNN's iReport.com. ""These was no plume, no nothing,"" she said by phone. ""It just kind of blacked out."" She said the telecast did not show the rocket's impact clearly. ""I was looking for some action -- something happening,"" she said. ""I think a lot of people were, because they [NASA] hyped it up, you know. ... No one saw anything."" Stracener woke up her husband and two children to see the lunar crash. She said she wishes she hadn't. Darrick Gray, a high school science teacher near Kansas City, Missouri, had planned to take some of his students to the nearby Powell Observatory to watch the lunar impact through their telescopes -- but they decided to skip the field trip because of bad weather. ""This is truly a once-in-a-lifetime thing,"" Gray had said beforehand. Gray -- who is also the director of the Astronomical Society of Kansas City -- said he had hoped the mission would influence his students to think about pursuing careers in science. ""Being as we do live here in Missouri, we're away from the hub [of astronomy],"" he explained. ""We're not in Florida, we're not in Texas, we're not in Silicon Valley -- it's not something they're used to seeing. ""So any time you can show them something that's never been done, and they say, 'Oh this is pretty cool,' I think they buy into that."" NASA held an all-night party at Ames Research Center -- located just outside San Francisco -- which was directing the mission. There were movies, music, food and guest speakers, and it culminated with a live transmission of the lunar impact. ""I would have loved to see, you know, huge amounts of dust flying up and ejecta, but we didn't,"" said Liza Coe, who attended the Ames event. ""I thought it was so neat being able to see just as we got closer and closer to the moon and realizing that that was really happening right now. ""It wasn't just a picture of the moon that somebody was putting up."" Back at Fremont Peak Observatory, even though most of the 50 people who attended the ""impact party"" were disappointed, they were good sports about the ""failure,"" Samuels said. Even Samuels, who has been an astronomer since he was 15 years old, said he got a lot out of the viewing party -- which he said was standing-room only. ""I don't look at the moon so much because it's always there ... so I got to know the moon's craters better,"" he said. ""And I think the people that attended, some of them that were disappointed, [still] felt like it was worth coming and being part of something that was going on."" He said he hopes the event generates more support for the observatory, which is run by volunteers. It is located in Fremont Peak State Park, which is on a list of state parks that could close because of California's recent budget cuts. ""We're trying to promote interest in the peak and every single person that came was part of that,"" he said. ""They all learned something."" Fremont Peak Observatory has a 30-inch telescope that Samuels described as ""the most accessible public telescope in the [San Francisco] Bay area."" He said he hoped that the reason they didn't see a plume from the rocket impact wasn't because of ""another case where somebody forgot to carry the one"" -- a reference to incorrect mathematical computation, which was blamed for the failure of the Mars Surveyor Climate Orbiter mission to Mars in 1999. He suggested that next time, NASA might want to be ""a little more careful suggesting people should get out of bed at 4:30 in the morning and haul their kids out there."" CNN's John D. Sutter contributed to this report.","NASA crashes rockets into the moon on Friday to test for lunar water .

"(CNN) -- The pilot of a Boeing 737 was in the cockpit, preparing to take off with 101 passengers, when police arrested him for flying with a fake pilot's license, investigators said. The 41-year-old Swedish man was poised to fly on Tuesday night from Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, to Ankara, Turkey, when investigators ""caught the pilot red-handed during his flight preparation,"" according to a statement from the Dutch National Police Services Agency. Authorities charged him with forgery and flying without a valid license, the statement said. It's apparently not the first time the man, whose identity was not divulged, has tried to fly without a license. Investigators in Sweden charged the man several years ago with flying with a fake license, but they did not pursue the case because they couldn't find him, said Anders Lundblad, a spokesman for the Swedish Transport Agency. The Swedes got a tip recently that the man was flying for a Turkish company and that he would soon be in the Netherlands, Lundblad said. They passed that information to Dutch police, which led to the pilot's arrest at the Schiphol airport in Amsterdam. The man said he had flown for 13 years for companies in Belgium, Great Britain and Italy, the Dutch police said, though it was unclear whether he had a license for all or part of that time. He recently had a valid license to fly small commercial airplanes, but that license had expired and would not have allowed him to fly passenger aircraft, the Dutch statement said. Lundblad also said the man once had a valid pilot's license. ""Why he never renewed it I guess only he knows,"" he said.

We'll explain how in today's edition of CNN Student News. Hi, everyone. Carl Azuz is off this week. I'm Natisha Lance. First Up: Afghan Crashes . LANCE: First up, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The countries share a border, and they also share a common problem: threats from militant groups and terrorists like the Taliban and al Qaeda. It's an issue facing both nations' governments, and one that the U.S. government is concerned about as well. That's why President Obama has been holding a series of meetings with some of his advisers. They're reviewing the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Samantha Hayes has the latest on those meetings and on the violence in the region. (BEGIN VIDEO) SAMANTHA HAYES, CNN CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.: Two helicopter crashes make it the deadliest day in four years for Americans in Afghanistan. While a NATO security force spokesman says enemy fire is not to blame, the loss of 14 Americans comes while President Barack Obama is considering a request to send thousands more troops to the region to fight al Qaeda. The president addressed service men and women in Jacksonville, Florida Monday, after a White House meeting with his national security team. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Fourteen Americans gave their lives, and our prayers are with these service members, their civilian colleagues and the families who loved them. HAYES: The deadliest of the two crashes happened following a raid on suspected drug traffickers, and three DEA agents were among those killed. Also among the dead, three U.S. civilians, members of the embassy community. The State Department says the efforts of civilians and other nonmilitary personnel are essential to the overall mission. JACOB LEW, DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE: Improving Afghan governance, providing security, justice, jobs and services, and giving the Afghan people a meaningful alternative, as much as possible, to the Taliban's recruiting. HAYES: Democratic Senator John Kerry, off of a recent trip to the region, addressed those efforts and the U.S. relationship with the Afghan government in a Washington speech. SEN. JOHN KERRY, (D) MASSACHUSETTS: The fact that the Afghan government has not prosecuted a single high level drug trafficker damages all of our efforts because it goes to the fundamental question of credibility. HAYES: President Obama's White House meeting was the sixth in a series of high-level discussions about what to do in Afghanistan, as the administration awaits results from that country's November 7th presidential runoff. For CNN Student News, I'm Samantha Hayes. (END VIDEO) I.D. Me . CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I was born in 1939 in Searchlight, Nevada. I was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986, and I'm currently the Senate Majority Leader, which means I'm the highest ranking member of the Senate's majority party. I'm Harry Reid, a Democrat who is the senior senator from Nevada. Public Option . LANCE: And in that role as majority leader, it's Sen. Reid's job to help combine health care bills from different committees into a single bill that can be presented to the entire Senate. Yesterday, Sen. Reid announced that the combined bill will include a government-run health care program; what's been called the public option. During his announcement, Reid also said that the bill will let individual states choose not to take part in the public option. They would have until the year 2014 to make that decision. This has been one of the most controversial issues in the debate over health care reform. Critics argue that if companies use the public option, then some people might lose the health care coverage that they currently have and are happy with. But Sen. Reid believes it's an important part of the reform. SEN. HARRY REID, (D-NV) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: I believe that the public option can achieve a goal of bringing meaningful reform to our broken system. It will protect consumers, keep insurers honest, ensure competition, and that's why we intend to include it in the bill that we submitted, that will be submitted to the Senate. Tea Party Protests . LANCE: Meanwhile, the Tea Party Express is back on the road, protesting issues like government involvement in health care. The Express, which is named for both the organization and its bus, launched a new tour Sunday in California with rallies in San Diego and Los Angeles, where some people actually showed up to protest the Tea Party protesters. The Express plans to hold demonstrations in dozens of cities over the next several weeks. One of the group's main goals is the push for less government involvement, and these rallies also aim to give people who feel that way an opportunity to express their views. CHRIS KEAYS, TEA PARTY PROTESTER: We need to get back to the days when we were responsible and we assumed the responsibility of ourselves and our families, and the government is not a part of my daily life. I really resent the government taking up so much of my time that I'm down here having to protest right now. New Jobs Outlook . LANCE: And some potentially good news for the U.S. economy: A new survey indicates that companies are planning to hire more employees in the very near future. The report from the National Association of Business Economics says for the first time since the recession started nearly two years ago, the number of employers planning to hire workers over the next six months is higher than the number of jobs that are expected to be cut during that same time. The country's current unemployment rate is 9.8 percent. That's the highest the statistic has been in more than a quarter century. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout!

You've got three seconds -- GO! You'll find the Army's Drill Sergeant School at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Top Drill Sergeant . LANCE: Drill sergeants are responsible for training tens of thousands of soldiers every year. And the head of the Drill Sergeant School, its commandant, is responsible for training them. The current commandant broke new ground when she took over the position last month because she's the first she to head up the school. Jason Carroll introduces us to this trailblazing soldier. (BEGIN VIDEO) JASON CARROLL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Historically, this is the image of the military drill sergeant: a tough guy. That was then; this is now. At 48, Command Sergeant Major Teresa King is the first woman to lead the Army's Drill Sergeant Training School. What are you looking for? I mean, because it all pretty much looks like everybody's exercising to me. CMD. SGT. MAJOR TERESA KING: I'm looking for attention to detail, conformance. CARROLL: Before sunrise at Ft. Jackson, South Carolina, King readies her drill instructor candidates for a rigorous run. What's wrong with that? KING: That's too big, Top. You need to break it up. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fall out! CARROLL: She leads by example. King runs the five-mile course from the front of the pack, outperforming men half her age. STAFF SGT. LERON DELANEY, U.S. ARMY: She's older than me, so if I fall out and she's still running, I feel bad. CARROLL: Extinguishing those who think a woman can't be commandant. SGT. 1ST CLASS MICHAEL CHILDS, U.S. ARMY: We've got to stay on top of our game even more than we used to with her, because she's that sharp. CARROLL: King says she wakes up some mornings still shocked she is commandant. KING: I had never considered it, although I've been in training for about seven years. But I never considered it, the Drill Sergeant School. CARROLL: King's first Army job some 30 years ago was postal clerk, but her hero, General George Patton, inspired her. KING: I saw that he had the respect of his men. And I saw he was resolute. CARROLL: King eventually rose through the ranks, excelling at training infantry men and paratroopers alike. KING: I'm doing what I've always done. It's just now, people are paying attention to it. CARROLL: And to her opinions. The military prohibits women from serving in front line combat roles. King trains men for combat and thinks it's time to train qualified women. KING: I think if they can do it, they should be allowed to do it. CARROLL: The reality: Women make up 14 percent of active soldiers in the Army. Some women question how many others will follow in King's footsteps. OPERATIONS SGT. ANGELA ANDREWS, U.S. ARMY: I wouldn't say it opens the door, but it may crack it somewhat. CARROLL: King says she will continue to lead by example. KING: I have vision. And I believe I can cause people to do some things that they thought they never could do. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, some science projects can balloon out of control.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Let those other filmmakers focus on world destruction or masked superheroes or beautiful people doing beautiful things. Jason Bateman plays the owner of an extract factory in ""Extract,"" Mike Judge's latest. Mike Judge prefers to deal with real life. Judge, writer and director of ""Office Space"" and co-creator of the TV series ""King of the Hill,"" has long liked to set his work in the world of malfunctioning copiers and beer-drinking propane salesmen. Even his wicked satire of the future, ""Idiocracy,"" focused on the inanities of everyday life, just set 500 years from now. His new film, ""Extract,"" is no exception: It's about a factory owner, Joel (Jason Bateman), who must deal with a host of employee problems as well as a chilly wife. Of course, Joel's solutions aren't exactly the stuff of Solomon, but such is the way of comedy. Bateman understands Judge's motivations. ""He likes to keep everything very middle-of-the-road common people, small town, small problems, relatable, blue-collar,"" said the actor, who called Judge ""a ninja of comedy."" ""And those people, they run extract factories; they make drywall. I mean, it's the stuff that we all need often goes unnoticed; he likes to write about those people, and I'm glad he does."" ""Extract,"" which also stars Mila Kunis, Kristen Wiig, J.K. Simmons and a long-haired and heavily bearded Ben Affleck, opens Friday. Judge talked to CNN about his subject matter and his cast. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: Where did this idea come from? I'd read that you worked in a factory before. Mike Judge: Yeah, it kind of came from all over the place. I've worked many jobs, and I did work in a factory a couple times -- a place that made guitar amps, and then I worked in a place in Albuquerque [New Mexico], where I grew up, that stuffed those snack boxes with Fritos and candy bars and stuff. CNN: Casting for the film, how did that come together? Did you have a set idea in your head? Judge: When I first wrote the first draft, I wasn't thinking about anybody in particular and, then I saw ""Arrested Development"" years later. I['d] put the script on the shelf and thought Jason Bateman would be perfect, so I did a rewrite thinking about him but no one in particular for the other characters. I just wrote it and then just did kind of the normal casting process. But then, we were reading people for the character of [Joel's friend] Dean, and my casting director comes in one day and said, ""Ben Affleck is interesting."" And I thought, ""Really, I've never met the guy."" And I [also] thought, ""Yeah, but he's like strapping, handsome leading-man guy."" Then I started thinking about it, and I love him when he's a character actor like in ""Dazed and Confused"" or ""Shakespeare in Love,"" and then I met him, and he just got it. He had this take on him based on a guy he went to high school with. We did a read-through the script, and him and Jason just killing me, I just thought it was just really funny. You know, he was willing to get out of his leading man look and grow a beard. It was really fun. CNN: It was fun to see him do that. It was a different dynamic. Judge: Yeah. I think Ben, actually, I think he enjoyed being this character. I think he hasn't gotten to do something like that in a while. In fact, we had a big break [during shooting]. ... And he has one scene in the factory, so he had like maybe two or three weeks between the bulk of it and that last scene in it. I got the sense he was really happy to come back and put on his ""Dean"" get-up and get back into that character. He was just really fun. CNN: And Joel, he's a nice guy who just wants to have sex with his wife. It seems pretty simple. Judge: Yeah, and I think he, you know, he, he wants kind of simple things, and he's worked so hard. It's maybe be a little bit of a mid-life crisis he's going through, I think. And he just sort of tests the waters, dips his toe in, doing something a little crazy, and then just everything goes to hell for him. CNN: We saw this with ""Office Space,"" too, making the workplace funny. What's that process like? Judge: Well, to me, I think there's a lot of interesting characters [at work], and just the dynamics of a workplace are really ... funny to me. I've had a lot of jobs, and I think there's a lot of material there and, I just remember thinking, growing up in the '80s, thinking like everyone on TV shows and movies, these characters seem to have like endless cash. You never see, [when you] become an adult and even as a teenager, it's like, ""OK, I gotta pay my car insurance, and I gotta do this and that."" And then you get a job, and it's like, you're there all day. ... I don't know, I think if your soul doesn't get stomped out of you, you can still see the comedy in all of it. So I'd wanted to do something that's set in more a blue-collar place like a factory, and it's told from the point of view of the guy who owns it and sympathetic to him instead of the employee angry at the bosses. CNN: Why extract? Are you an extract expert? Judge: (laughs) Well, there was a couple of reasons. There was a book lying around my freshman year in the college dorms that was about food flavoring, and I actually just thought it was kind of interesting. Then years later, south of Austin [Texas], there used to be this really great building; it was the Adams Extract Factory. ... My Realtor one day, we were looking at a house, and he points to a really nice house in this neighborhood, and he says, ""That's where the Adams Extract people live."" It's just this odd item that's in every grocery store in the country, but you don't think about it much, and when I'd say that that's what it's about, people start laughing. So I figured I'm one step ahead of it there.","Mike Judge's new movie, ""Extract,"" is comedy set in a factory .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- A law allowing same-sex weddings took effect Thursday in Mexico City, one day after the second same-sex marriage was performed in Argentina. The Mexican measure also allows same-sex couples to adopt children. Mexico City Mayor Marcelo Ebrard has said officials will be prepared to implement the new city law. The Mexican Institute for Sexology, a private educational institution founded in 1979, held a workshop last month for the 60 Civil Registry judges who will perform the weddings, said Juan Luis Alvarez-Gayou, the institute's founder and director. Workshops are being held this week for 120 civil court judges who may have to rule on domestic issues after the weddings, Alvarez-Gayou said. The Catholic Church has been opposed to the law, but officials have accepted the measure, the institute director said. ""We haven't had any problems with the judges,"" Alvarez-Gayou said. The Mexico City law comes amid the beginning of wider acceptance for same-sex unions in Latin America. In Argentina, Damian Bernath and Jorge Salazar were married Wednesday in a civil ceremony in the nation's capital, Buenos Aires, the official Telam news agency reported. Judicial measures had prevented gay marriage in Buenos Aires, but a judge issued a ruling last week allowing the two men to marry. It was the second same-sex marriage in Argentina. The previous wedding took place in Tierra del Fuego after two men were denied a permit in Buenos Aires. In that case, a Buenos Aires court had ruled that a ban on same-sex marriage was illegal and ordered the proper authorities to grant the couple a marriage license if they applied for one. On the eve of their December 1 wedding, however, another court filed an injunction, halting the nuptials. In many Latin American jurisdictions, the issue of same-sex marriage is decided on the local and state level.","Measure also allows same-sex couples to adopt children in Mexico's capital city .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)  -- The man believed to be the suicide bomber who killed seven CIA employees and contractors last year appears in a newly released video, claiming to have tricked Jordanian intelligence officers as a double agent. The 43-minute video, posted on various Islamic radical Web sites Saturday, shows Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi, whom a former U.S. intelligence official identified as the suicide bomber. Family members have said that the man in the video, who uses the alias Abu Dajana Al-Khorasani, is al-Balawi. A much shorter version of the video was posted online in January. The December 30 bombing at a U.S. base in Khost, in southeastern Afghanistan, killed seven CIA operatives and a Jordanian army captain. The video posted Saturday is dated ""Safar 1431"" on the lunar calendar, which includes any day between January 16, 2010 and February 13, 2010. In the video, al-Balawi says killing the CIA team wasn't part of the initial plan. ""We planned for something but got a bigger gift -- a gift from God -- who brought us ... a valuable prey: Americans, and from the CIA."" The video opens with a montage of images -- including clips of torture and meetings of world leaders, such as former President George W. Bush with Jordan's King Abdullah and President Obama. A narrator criticizes the ""infidel West,"" and talks of crimes against Muslims. Al-Balawi then appears on the video, vowing to bring down the CIA and saying how he deceived Jordanian officials into believing he worked for them. ""Look, this is for you,"" he says to the camera, while sitting in a vehicle. ""It's not a watch. It's a detonator to kill as many as I can, God willing."" Later in the video, al-Balawi gives an interview to As-Sahab Media, the production wing of al Qaeda. He says he had tried to join ""jihad"" in Iraq after the start of the U.S.-led war there. He began to write on online forums about jihad, he tells an unidentified interviewer in a room. He says he found his opportunity to join the militant mission after being recruited by Jordanian officials as a spy in Afghanistan. Al-Balawi was recruited by Jordanian authorities as a counterterrorism intelligence source, a Jordanian official told CNN last month. ""Actually, Jordanian intelligence -- may God send consecutive curses on it -- is the one who gave me a large amount of money, it is the one who paid for my ticket, and it is the one who helped me to forge some documents I needed to get a Pakistani visa,"" the man in the video says. Jordanian and U.S. intelligence agencies apparently believed al-Balawi had been rehabilitated from his extremist views and were using him to hunt Ayman al-Zawahiri, al Qaeda's No. 2 figure, a former U.S. intelligence official said. Al-Balawi claims in the video that the Jordanian authorities paid him and that the money went to support the Mujahedeen. ""So this is a new era for the Mujahedeen, God willing, in which the Mujahedeen will use intelligence-based tactics and methods which rival or even exceed those of the security apparatuses of the strongest of states, like Jordan and America, with the permission of Allah, Lord of the worlds,"" he says. Al-Balawi said he initially targeted a Jordanian official, referred to as Sharif Ali bin Zaid. The narrator said that Zaid, an army captain, was killed in the attack. ""So it wasn't planned this way,"" al-Balawi said. ""The target was Abu Zaid, but the stupidity of Jordanian intelligence and the stupidity of American intelligence is what has turned it into a valuable prey. It's a blessing from Allah."" The man explained why he was choosing a suicide mission, or ""martyrdom,"" for his attack on the U.S. base in Khost. ""You can only get a maximum number of kills for a minimum number of martyrs and losses in the ranks of the Mujahedeen with a martyrdom operation,"" he said.","Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi has been ID'd as bomber who killed 7 CIA agents .

"BURSA, Turkey (CNN) -- Armenian President Serzh Sarkisian Wednesday became the first Armenian head of state to travel to Turkey to attend a soccer game between the two countries' national teams. Armenian President Serzh Sarkasian (right) pictured with Turkish counterpart Abdullah Gul during Gul's visit to Yerevan in 2008. Sarkisian and Turkish president Abdullah Gul arrived at the stadium in Bursa together in a car flying the national flags of both countries. In an exclusive interview with CNN before the game, Gul said the event opened a new chapter for relations between Armenia and Turkey. But when asked, he avoided saying whether the border between the two neighbors would be opened before 2010. At the match, Turkish supporters vastly outnumbered Armenian fans and gave the Armenian national anthem the standard treatment for most visiting foreign teams -- they booed. Small pockets of Armenian supporters waved the tri-color flag of Armenia. Turkey won the World Cup qualifying group game 2-0 but with both countries already unable to progress to the 2010 tournament in South Africa, the significance of the game was in its symbolism. This round of ""football diplomacy,"" comes just days after the two governments signed a historic series of protocols to establish diplomatic relations between the two neighbors. ""This is going to be the biggest change in the South Caucasus since 1994,"" said Gevorg Tel-Gabrielyan, the Armenia country director for the Eurasia Partnership Foundation. He was in Bursa on Wednesday, hosting a conference of Armenian and Turkish academics examining bilateral relations. ""If this happens,"" he added, ""its going to change geopolitics in the region."" Armenia and Turkey have been separated by nearly a century of animosity and distrust. The protocols call for establishment of embassies in each others' capitals, and for re-opening the Turkish-Armenian border, which has been closed since 1993. The soccer game was also being held in Bursa, which centuries ago was the capital of the Ottoman Empire. Thousands of police were deployed to maintain strict security. On Tuesday, Turkey's prime minister made a public appeal to Turkish football fans, to greet Sarkisian with hospitality and to avoid provocations. Despite strong support from the United States, the European Union and Russia, there is considerable opposition among nationalists in Turkey and Armenia to the peace process. Sarkisian has been met by angry protests both within Armenia and among the influential diaspora communities in the United States, France and Lebanon. Thousands of protesters in the Armenian capital marched to the country's genocide memorial chanting ""no concessions to the Turks,"" last week. Armenia has long demanded that Turkey recognize the World War I-era massacre of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Armenians by Ottoman Turkish soldiers as genocide. Modern-day Turkey vehemently denies a genocide took place and is calling for an international commission of historical experts to examine these tragic events. Meanwhile, opposition party leaders in Turkey have criticized the agreement, as has Turkey's close ally in the Caucasus, Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan fought and lost a war against Armenia in the early 1990s. On Sunday, Turkey's prime minister made a fresh call for Armenia to withdraw its troops from the disputed Azerbaijani territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. For the new agreement to go into effect, the documents must first be put to a vote in the Turkish and Armenian parliaments. There is no guarantee lawmakers will ratify the agreement. The process of unraveling the complicated network of regional, domestic and historical grievances dividing Armenia and Turkey was jump-started in September of 2008, when Gul traveled to Yerevan to attend a football match between the two national teams. The diplomatic rapprochement has also gotten valuable support from powerful patrons, experts say. ""This is one of the few places in the world where Russia and the United States are pulling in the same direction,"" says Hugh Pope, an expert on Turkey with the International Crisis Group. ""Both want to see a more stable Caucasus."" Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were both present at the signing ceremony for the Turkish-Armenian agreement in Switzerland on Saturday. Wednesday's game in Bursa was the final match for the coach of the Turkish national team, Fatih Terim, who announced his resignation after Turkey's most recent football defeat. Despite that, the headline in one of Turkey's biggest newspapers billed today's football game ""Our most challenging match.""","Armenian president's visit comes amid thaw in relations between neighbors .

"(CNN) -- Soccer star John Terry's role as captain of England's national team is in jeopardy following tabloid accusations of his marital infidelity, according to a British government minister. Terry is alleged to have had an affair with the ex-partner of his former Chelsea teammate Wayne Bridge, having failed in a high court bid to prevent newspapers publishing details of his liaison with Vanessa Perroncel. The 29-year-old has two children with his wife Toni, whom he married in June 2007, and was named ""2009 Dad of the Year"" by a British sauce maker. He reportedly earns more than $200,000 a week. French actress and model Perroncel had a child with Terry's fellow England defender Bridge in 2006. The pair have since separated but Bridge, who is now at English club Manchester City, said on Saturday that he would not be commenting for the sake of their son. Sports Minister Gerry Sutcliffe said he would contact the English Football Association about the matter, the UK Press Association reported. ""On the field John Terry is a fantastic player and a good England captain, but to be the captain of England you have got to have wider responsibilities for the country,"" Sutcliffe said. ""And clearly if these allegations are proven -- and at the moment they are only allegations -- then it does call into question his role as England captain. ""I speak to the FA on a regular basis, so I will be asking what their viewpoint is and we will see what comes of it."" Perroncel has enlisted the services of noted celebrity publicist Max Clifford, PA reported, and he said she told him that some of the allegations were true. ""She has never spoken to a single journalist and she's all over all the papers with all kinds of allegations, some of which she said were true and some of which she said aren't true,"" Clifford told the GMTV television program. ""All I'm prepared to say is that she's known John a long time, and obviously I think during that time they've become very close friends, but anything more than that, I wouldn't want to say at this particular stage. It's really for her to decide what she wants to do."" While Terry's alleged infidelity may not have the global impact as that of golf superstar Tiger Woods, it could cause big problems for England ahead of June's World Cup finals in South Africa. Bridge, who is sidelined with injury, is not guaranteed to be part of the squad but has represented his country 36 times and is the regular back-up at left-back for Chelsea's Ashley Cole. England coach Fabio Capello is out of the UK following a knee operation, but is expected to make a decision on Terry's future before the friendly international against African Nations Cup winners Egypt on March 3, PA reported. The FA has released a statement saying that Capello, known to be a strict disciplinarian, ""alone will make the decision about John Terry's position."" ""Fabio is fully up to speed with developments regarding John Terry. He spoke with our chairman Lord Triesman and chief executive Ian Watmore today, who both backed him to make the best decision for England on footballing grounds,"" the FA said on its Web site on Monday evening. ""Fabio is dealing with the matter in his own way using his extensive experience as a football manager."" Terry was first named captain of England after the 2006 World Cup when Steve McClaren took over as manager from Sven Goran Eriksson, and retained the armband when Capello was appointed in 2008. It is not the first time that Terry has been the subject of controversy. Last year he was accused by a tabloid paper of accepting money to show fans around Chelsea's training ground, and in 2002 he was cleared by a court after being charged with assault and affray following an incident with a nightclub bouncer.","John Terry's role as England soccer captain in jeopardy due to his alleged marital infidelity .

"(CNN)  -- Hondurans will answer two questions Sunday when the troubled Central American nation holds elections: Who will win the presidency, and will voters heed calls for a boycott? The answer to a third question will remain unanswered for a while: Will the international community recognize the newly elected leader even though the vote was held under the stewardship of interim President Roberto Micheletti, who came to power after a coup? ""The government needs a strong turnout and limited irregularities in order to claim that the elections are legitimate, especially given that there will not be international observers from the [Organization of American States] or the Carter Center,"" said Heather Berkman, a Latin America analyst with the Eurasia Group consulting firm. Ousted President Manuel Zelaya has said he will not recognize the election results and has called for a boycott. Many nations also have said they will withhold recognition of the winner in Honduras. In a written statement, State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said the United States ""remains committed to help restore the democratic and constitutional order in Honduras in the wake of the June 28 coup d'etat that removed President Zelaya and led to the suspension of Honduras from the Organization of American States."" He called the November 29 elections ""another critical step in the restoration of the democratic and constitutional order in Honduras,"" and noted that the electoral process is conducted ""under the stewardship of the multi-party and autonomous Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which was also selected before the coup."" Honduran authorities seemed to be preparing for violence. Police and the military have stockpiled 10,000 tear gas canisters and other crowd-control equipment, ""triggering fears of an increased risk of excessive and disproportionate use of force by security forces around the presidential elections,"" said the human rights organization Amnesty International. The Gordian knot of Honduran politics was tied early June 28 when a military-backed coup removed Zelaya from power, shuttling him off in his pajamas to nearby Costa Rica. Congress swore in Micheletti, the Legislature's president, as his replacement a few hours later. The United Nations, OAS, European Union and most nations -- including the United States -- condemned the coup and demanded that Zelaya be reinstated. Five months later, Zelaya is still not in power, holed up instead in the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras. The ousted president returned secretly to his country September 21 and obtained refuge at the embassy. It looked like a solution had been reached October 29, when Zelaya and Micheletti agreed to a deal brokered by the United States. The pact said Congress would vote on Zelaya's return to power after consultation with the nation's Supreme Court and other bodies. The vote was supposed to be held within a week but now is set for next week after the elections. The Supreme Court ruled 14-1 this week that Zelaya cannot return to office without facing trial first on charges that he acted unconstitutionally when trying to hold a vote that could have led to the lifting of presidential term limits. The Supreme Court had ruled that the vote was illegal, and Congress had forbidden it. The coup came on the day that vote was supposed to be held. Micheletti stepped down temporarily this week to try to distance himself from Sunday's elections. He said he will resume office Wednesday. The new president is scheduled to be sworn in January 27. In addition to the presidency, at stake in Sunday's election are three vice presidents, 128 members of Congress and mayors and other municipal leaders throughout the nation. Among the five major presidential candidates, Porfirio Lobo Sosa of the opposition National Party is considered the front-runner. Polls last month showed him with a double-digit lead over Elvin Santos of the Liberal Party. Zelaya and Micheletti are Liberal Party members, and their rift has splintered the party. The other three candidates are Bernard Martinez of the Innovation and Unity Party-Social-Democracy, Felicito Avila of the Christian Democrat Party and Cesar Ham of the Democratic Unification Party. A sixth candidate, Carlos Reyes, withdrew this month. Amnesty International said Friday that human rights activists and journalists critical of Micheletti's government have been receiving increased threats and intimidation. For example, Amnesty International said, the Honduran military requested that a local mayor provide a list of names and telephone numbers for members of the opposition Resistencia movement. ""Today, there's an environment of fear and intimidation in Honduras,"" said Javier Zuniga, head of Amnesty International's delegation in Honduras. ""We have seen an increased level of harassment against those who are seen as opposed to the de facto authorities, and officials responsible for the protection of human rights are not doing anything to investigate the incidents or stop them.""","NEW: U.S. State Department says elections are ""critical step"" to restore order .

Which leads us inexorably to Michaele and Tareq Salahi's exuberant Facebook posting: ""Honored to be at the White House for the state dinner in honor of India with President Obama and our First Lady!"" They have the pictures to prove it, and the overnight fame, too. The Salahis, with a Bravo camera crew in tow, apparently were trying to ratchet up their prospects for the cable network's upcoming ""The Real Housewives of D.C."" If only the Salahis were the exception. But the modern-day reality show genre, spearheaded nearly a decade ago by the first edition of CBS' ""Survivor,"" has become a tidal wave of cost-efficient TV programming starring ... pretty much anyone. Its inhabitants increasingly are called on to step up the pace in pursuit of myriad available slots on networks large, small and sometimes desperate. Stand out in a crowd, or be pushed aside by someone who will. Crashing a White House state dinner has proved to be just the ticket for the fame-craving Salahis. Their audacious breach of Secret Service security has trumped the reality show aspirations of the ""balloon boy"" family and possibly even knocked Jon Gosselin out of the ""Entertainment Tonight"" spotlight for a day or two. Imagine that. What does this say about us as a people? Well, the quest for fame is hardly new. Nor is our collective fascination with train wrecks. What's changed is the escalation in available venues. There's seemingly no limit to the number of enablers out there. Hitting it big with a ""reality"" franchise can work wonders for a TV network's bottom line, overall visibility -- or both. Once upon a time, TLC was The Learning Channel. You actually could learn something by watching its instructional and educational programming. But the network gradually got out of that business. And it hit the mother lode with ""Jon & Kate Plus 8,"" which eventually became the public face of a broken marriage while making the Gosselins internationally famous. Bravo, home to the ever-expanding ""Real Housewives"" franchise, used to devote itself to the performing arts. That began to change in a hurry after NBC Universal took control of the network in 2002. The network now offers a virtual wall-to-wall reality lineup, with only occasional intrusions from ""Inside the Actors Studio,"" the only remaining evidence of what Bravo used to be. A&E originally launched as the Arts & Entertainment Network. Believe it or not, it once housed an anthology series, ""A&E Stage,"" that brought its audience plays, concerts, documentaries and even opera. The reality bug long since has bitten hard, though, with the once high-minded cable outlet now best known for ""Dog the Bounty Hunter, Intervention"" and ""Criss Angel Mindfreak."" MTV used to be nothing but music videos. ""The Real World"" changed everything. NBC had a long and well-earned reputation for Emmy-caliber comedies and dramas such as ""Seinfeld,"" ""The Cosby Show,"" ""Frasier,"" ""Hill Street Blues,"" ""ER"" and ""L.A. Law."" Now its most popular attraction, other than ""Sunday Night Football,"" is a weekly two-hour dose of ""The Biggest Loser,"" where little other than size matters. Against this backdrop, the Salahis in a way are only acting naturally. That's lamentable, a sad commentary, an appalling sign of our times, etc., etc. But TV has created -- and continues to create -- a bottomless pit of venues where preeners are prized commodities and abnormal behavior is not only encouraged but intrinsic to the common goal. The lone exception these days appears to be major league baseball. When a goofball fan runs out onto the field, the cameras turn away so as not to reward the trespasser with a minute or two of national or regional exposure. What a concept. Too bad it'll never catch on. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Bark.","Reality shows are a low-cost form of entertainment for TV networks, says Ed Bark .

"(CNN) -- A 9-year-old girl was laid to rest Wednesday as a 15-year-old girl, described as an acquaintance, was in court on charges she carried out the younger girl's murder . Elizabeth Olten was coming home from a friend's house last week in St. Martins, Missouri, when she disappeared. Distraught residents searched for days for Olten without luck, when the Cole County Sheriff's Department received a tip that led them to the alleged killer. It didn't lead them to a stranger, a child predator or a convicted sex offender -- avenues police had originally considered because of Olten's age . Instead, it led them to a 15-year-old girl who, according to Peggy Florence, a family spokeswoman, had played with Olten. The girl then led police to the body -- which was found in an area authorities searched before, the sheriff's department said, but was hidden so well they hadn't seen it. Authorities said both physical evidence and some written evidence led to the suspect's arrest. She has been charged with first-degree murder. On Wednesday, Olten's family looked towards closure as two drastically different scenes unfolded in Missouri. Olten's family and friends watched as two white horses pulled her casket in a glass hearse. Hours earlier, a judge had ordered the 15-year-old suspect to be held while he decides whether she should be tried in adult court. Authorities have not released the suspect's name. Authorities released few details about the case, though they said an autopsy was conducted Saturday. The Olten family spent the day of Elizabeth's funeral remembering a very special little girl and mourning their loss, choosing to celebrate her life, instead of attending the court hearing of the teen accused of killing her. After the funeral ceremony, they released pink balloons, in honor of Elizabeth Olten's favorite color. For them, it was about their little girl -- the one who was always ready with a bright smile. ""She wanted to be a mother, she wanted to love others and take care of others,"" family spokeswoman Florence told HLN's Nancy Grace. ""She was just a lovely child -- she never met an animal she didn't love and dress up and play with."" She loved to dress up and put on fancy dresses, Florence said, even in the snow and the mud. ""She was a beautiful little girly girl,"" Florence said. ""She had everyone's heart.""","15-year-old suspect accused planning, carrying out murder of 9-year-old .

"(CNN)  -- Barcelona are desperate to call on the services of Lionel Messi and Zlatan Ibrahimovic for Tuesday's vital Champions League group showdown with Inter Milan in the Camp Nou. Barcelona must avoid defeat which could see them make a sensational exit if Russian surprise package Rubin Kazan beat Dynamo Kiev in the other match in Group F. The defending champions have been sweating on leading scorers Messi and Ibrahimovic, who both have thigh injuries. ""Messi has an injury in the abductor muscle of his left thigh,"" read a club statement. ""We do not discard his presence in Tuesday's game. ""As for Ibrahimovic, there has been an improvement with regards to his thigh injury but we will have to monitor the situation."" Barcelona have been in indifferent recent form and a 1-1 draw at Athletic Bilbao on Saturday saw them drop behind arch-rivals Real Madrid at the top of the Spanish La Liga. Barca will certainly want the key pair to be fit for next Sunday's El Clasico against Real, but first comes a European test against Jose Mourinho's Italian league-leaders. ""We know what we have to do,"" said Barca captain Carles Puyol. ""We have the same ambitions but we know Barca v Inter is a final and we will face the game as such. ""I don't like the word failure but not to qualify for the next round would be a huge blow,"" he added. ""This game will be a test of character for my players,"" Mourinho told reporters after his side's 3-1 win over Bologna on Saturday. They will also welcome back Wesley Sneijder, who has recovered from an ankle injury and will field Samuel Eto'o in attack as he returns to the Camp Nou for the first time since his close season transfer switch between the European powerhouses.","Barcelona sweating on fitness of Liionel Messi and Zlatan Ibrahimovic .

"(Tribune Media Services) -- I'm lost! For American Girl book fans, the ""Happy New Year, Julie"" story is an ideal gift for holiday road trips. Hopelessly, completely lost on a winding, backcountry road somewhere in Westchester County, N.Y. Did I mention it was night and pitch-black? ""How could you do this?"" asks my aggravated 16-year-old daughter, Mel. I'm not even sure. One minute we're on the highway and a couple of wrong turns later, here we are. None of the maps in the car showed the road we were on. Finally, we spot some open shops and a kind saleswoman in the Gap gave me directions. Guess what I want somebody to give me this holiday? A portable GPS! (Are you listening, elves?) L.L. Bean (www.llbean.com) has some that are under $100, TomTom (www.tomtom.com), has some for under $250. A GPS would be a welcome gift for any traveling family. It's no fun getting lost, whether close to home or on vacation in an unfamiliar city or country. Of course, my favorite gift of all would be a trip. Give those you love most the gift of an adventure together someplace new, or someplace that holds special memories, whether you are celebrating a special anniversary, birthday or simply a good year. Outfitters, cruise lines and resorts will help you arrange a custom itinerary -- and give you a good ""reunion"" deal too. Just make sure you get everyone on board with the idea before you fork over your credit card for those nonrefundable deposits. Give the adults different guidebooks about the region and if you are planning a trip to foreign shores, give each of the kids some Euros, Pesos, etc., to spend when they get there. They'll have fun and maybe hone a few math skills figuring out how much they've really got to spend. Maybe you want to encourage your kids' or grandkids' interest in exploring the world beyond their community. Buy them a subscription to National Geographic Kids (www.shopng.org) and for preschoolers, National Geographic Little Kids (subscriptions are just $15 a year.) Those planning road trips or plane trips with their children will thank you every time they travel, if you slip a portable DVD player under the tree or next to the Hanukkah Menorah. Disney (www.disneyshopping.com) has a new one that's compact and has twin 7-inch LCD screens and two sets of headphones. It sells for $179.99. Of course, you'll need a couple of new DVDs to watch. How about encouraging the young chefs in the gang with Pixar's ""Ratatouille,"" or spark your little pirate's sense of adventure with ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End."" If you're planning a holiday trip, bring along your favorite holiday movie. Books on tape are also a great bet for families who prefer the road to the skies. The story can become a shared experience because everyone, including the driver, can listen at the same time, assuming you can get the older kids to turn off their iPods. There are plenty of holiday stories, like ""A Christmas Carol"" performed by Jim Dale, who read the Harry Potter books so well, John Grisham's ""Skipping Christmas""(www.randomhouse.com/audio) read by Dennis Boutsikaris or Fannie Flagg reading her book ""A Redbird Christmas,"" which I just listened to on a long drive in Colorado. Also check out Brilliance Audio (www.brillianceaudio.com) for other titles like Adam Canfield's ""Watch Your Back"" about the adventures -- and misadventures of an intrepid middle-school reporter. Good old-fashioned books, of course, are great gifts too, especially if you can find one that relates to an experience you've shared on vacation or to a place you plan to visit. Ask your local children's librarian for suggestions. Maybe you've taken the kids to Cirque de Soleil or the Big Apple Circus, if so check out ""The Painted Circus"" (www.kidscanpress.com), which features beautiful illustrations that play tricks on the eye -- great to read together on a plane or at a relative's house. If you've been to San Francisco, buy your American Girl book fans (www.americangirl.com) the ""Happy New Year, Julie"" story about a girl growing up around San Francisco in the 1970s who celebrates the Chinese New Year with her best friend. An added plus: It will be fun for moms to share what their lives were like ""back in the old days"" through these historically accurate tales. I also like the Mini Mysteries from American Girl. No one should travel these days without a camera in his or her pocket -- to capture all those funny moments that don't always end up in the family scrapbook. Even better, the kids can take charge of creating family vacation Web pages. The experts at Take Great Pictures (www.TakeGreatPictures.com) suggest the Olympus Stylus 770 SW ($379.95) because it is shockproof, waterproof, crushproof and only weights 5.5 ounces. For teens, check out the Casio EX-S880 ($249.95), which comes in bright colors and is about the size of a credit card. The Casio EX also features a YouTube Capture mode so they can upload videos to the Web. The experts suggest the Pentax Optio E40 (under $150) for kids as young as six. No one, including kids, should travel without a lightweight, rolling duffel. Lands End (www.landsend.com) or L.L. Bean (www.llbean.com) offer them in a variety of colors and while you're at it, order a monogrammed fleece blanket for each child for those interminable car trips. I'm also a fan of fleece jackets and vests for travel because they're lightweight and dry quickly. You can find them everywhere, even for young kids.

"(CNN) -- Some Democrats had dubbed the possibility of a Barack Obama-Hillary Clinton pairing last year as a ""dream ticket,"" though the notion that the two once-bitter primary rivals would team up always seemed far-fetched. But then-Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama was more seriously considering picking Clinton as his running mate than any of his senior aides realized, according to a forthcoming book by former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe. Yet in the end, it may have been her husband President Clinton -- who had made headlines for his outbursts on the campaign trail during the primary season -- that ultimately scuttled the possibility. In the book, excerpts of which are running in the new issue of Time magazine, Plouffe said Obama took both him and senior aide David Axelrod by surprise when he insisted on including Clinton on the initial list of potential picks for the No. 2 spot on the ticket. ""Obama was clearly thinking more seriously about picking Hillary Clinton than Axelrod and I had realized,"" Plouffe writes. ""He said if his central criterion measured who could be the best VP, she had to be included in that list."" While Obama continued to consider picking Clinton throughout the summer of 2008, he ultimately eliminated her name from the list in early August, fearing, Plouffe writes, that there ""were just too many complications outweighing the potential strengths."" ""I think Bill may be too big a complication,"" Plouffe quotes Obama as saying. ""If I picked her, my concern is that there would be more than two of us in the relationship."" The new book, ""The Audacity to Win,"" hits book stores November 3.","Obama-Clinton pairing was deemed a far-fetched dream ticket by Democrats .

"(CNN) -- Elizabeth McCutchen and a friend were walking to book club two weeks ago in quaint Farmville, Virginia, when they strolled by a home on First Avenue. ""Something smells dead,"" her friend said. They were thinking animal. A dog, a cat, something like that. They never imagined they were smelling the remains of massacred humans. It was Thursday, September 17. But another 24 hours would pass before police made the gruesome discovery. Richard Samuel McCroskey III -- a 20-year-old rapper in the underground genre of ""Horrorcore"" who sang of chopping people into pieces -- has been arrested in connection with the slayings. The crime scene was so horrifying police would not even describe it, saying only that the victims died of blunt force trauma. The victims were Mark Niederbrock, 50, the beloved pastor at Walker's Presbyterian Church; his 16-year-old daughter, Emma Niederbrock; Melanie Wells, Emma's 18-year-old friend from West Virginia; and Niederbrock's estranged wife, Debra Kelley, 53, a professor at Longwood University. McCroskey has been charged only in the killing of Mark Niederbrock. Police and the prosecutor's office did not return repeated phone calls from CNN. But in late September, authorities said more charges are pending. Emma was described as a fan of Horrorcore and had met McCroskey through their mutual affection for the little-known music genre. Police said she invited McCroskey to fly from his northern California home, stay with her in Virginia and then attend the Strictly for the Wicked Festival, a Horrorcore fest in Michigan featuring bands with names like Dismembered Fetus and Phrozen Body Boy. Nobody saw what would come next. The slayings have been the talk of Farmville, a town of 7,000 that is home to Longwood University and nearby Hampden-Sydney College. Senseless is the word you hear most. It's not just the macabre nature of the killings that has people talking. It's the grotesque lyrics of the Horrorcore singer; it's that it happened under their noses. McCroskey is a young man with no criminal record who took delight in the blend of horror hip-hop that celebrated macabre killings. He went by the name Syko Sam. In one YouTube video, he holds a hatchet and sings about killing people and putting their remains in black bags: ""Last night I was the murderous rage. Now, I gotta get rid of the bodies before the corpses start to get to rotting."" 'Stinkiest rascal I've ever smelled' Authorities have not specified when the Virginia killings occurred, but at 4 a.m. on Friday, September 18, tow-truck driver Elton Napier was called out to Poor House Road to help McCroskey, whose car was stuck. Napier said McCroskey was wearing a black-hooded sweatshirt and ""was really smelling bad, like real bad. I can't describe it."" McCroskey was driving Mark Niederbrock's Honda. Napier said two sheriff's deputies were at the scene and McCroskey was ticketed for driving without a license. At the time, authorities didn't know the pastor had been slain. When McCroskey hopped into Napier's flatbed, the tow-truck driver said he started gagging from the odor and immediately rolled down the windows. ""I just held my head out the window so the wind would hit me in the face,"" he said. ""That was the stinkiest rascal I've ever smelled."" Napier drove McCroskey about four miles to a convenience store. McCroskey told Napier he was visiting his girlfriend and her father lent him the car. McCroskey fetched a black bag from the Honda before they parted. Napier went inside to get a cup of coffee. According to police, McCroskey eventually caught a cab to Richmond International Airport. By mid-afternoon that same day, police found the bodies at the home on First Avenue. McCroskey was arrested the next day at the airport, where he had spent the night. When he was being led to jail, McCroskey told reporters, ""Jesus told me to do it."" Suspect's family, community grieve . Sarah McCroskey of California told CNN-affiliate WWBT that her brother had been looking forward to his visit to Virginia for weeks. She mourned his arrest and struggled with the accusations against him. ""I want to hear his voice. I am so concerned, so worried -- not just for him [but] other people, other families involved dealing with this loss,"" she said. Read WWBT's special coverage . Defense attorney Cary Bowen told CNN, ""I don't want to say he's in shock. That's a medical term, but it's a big experience for him. ... I'm not sure he gets the severity of everything right now."" The community is still devastated by the events as it struggles to move forward. Memorial services were held over the weekend for Emma Niederbrock and her mother, Debra Kelley. The Rev. Sylvia Meadows of Farmville United Methodist Church baptized Emma at age 5 and her father when he was an adult. The pastor said the church has invited an occult specialist to speak with members of the community to help them come to grips with the dark side of humanity. ""We have looked evil in the face and cannot deny that it exists,"" Meadows said. ""God is stronger than evil. God is bigger."" Luther Glenn, a member of Walker's Presbyterian Church where Niederbrock was pastor, took issue with McCroskey's comment about Jesus telling him to act. ""I think it's deeply rooted in Satan, if you want to know the truth."" Elizabeth McCutchen, who passed the First Avenue home some time after the slayings, said the killings have affected every fabric of the community: the churches, the colleges, and their youth. ""This is the kind of town that goes to the rescue of survivors, but there's nobody [left] -- we can't do anything about it,"" she said. CNN's Gary Tuchman and Susan Chun contributed to this report.","20-year-old ""Horrorcore"" rapper accused in Virginia slayings .

"(CNN) -- The Rhode Island school superintendent who last week fired all the teachers and staff from a school whose students were performing poorly said Wednesday she is willing to negotiate now that the union has agreed to support changes. ""It is with great excitement that I read the press release from the Central Falls Teachers' Union referencing their proposed comprehensive reform agenda,"" said Central Falls Schools Superintendent Frances Gallo in a news release. ""It so closely mirrors my requests for assurances that I am pleased to reassure the union their place in the planning process. I do so with the belief that everyone has come to understand the meaning of comprehensive school reform."" Gallo added the school district will press ahead with its plan for improving Central Falls High School. In a written statement, American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said the union was pleased that Gallo has agreed to go back to the table. ""The dedicated teachers and staff want nothing more than to continue and improve upon the progress they have made,"" Weingarten said. ""Real, sustainable change will only happen when all stakeholders work together."" Gallo's statement came a day after the Central Fall Teachers Union recommended a number of changes, including increasing instructional time for students, enhancing their support and increasing teaching quality. Last week, the school board approved Gallo's plan to discharge 93 people -- classroom teachers, administrators and other personnel -- at the high school. The school is in a low-income area, and many of its students are Latino with English as their second language. The firings, which were to have become effective at the end of the school year, came after the district failed to reach an agreement with the teachers' union on a plan for teachers to spend more time with students to improve test scores. A union spokesman said the firings were drastic and cited a 21 percent rise in reading scores and a 3 percent hike in math scores in the past two years. Another official also pointed to progress at the school. But Rhode Island's Education Commissioner Deborah Gist defended the mass firings, calling them ""many years in coming."" Gist pointed out that the school's graduation rate is 48 percent, and ""only 7 percent of the students are proficient in mathematics."" ""More than half of the ninth-graders are failing more than two classes, which is an indication that they are frustrated, and what we know about student achievement, when students aren't successful in their class, they're much more likely to drop out of school,"" Gist said. In remarks Monday to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, President Obama appeared to express support for the firings. ""If a school continues to fail its students year after year after year, if it doesn't show signs of improvement, then there's got to be a sense of accountability,"" he said. ""And that's what happened in Rhode Island last week at a chronically troubled school, when just 7 percent of 11th graders passed state math tests -- 7 percent."" The AFT said Obama's comments ""do not reflect the reality on the ground and completely ignore the teachers' significant commitment to working with others to transform this school.""","Rhode Island school superintendent Frances Gallo says she's willing to negotiate .

"Washington (CNN) -- Gregg Keesling chooses his words carefully when he talks about the death of his son, Spc. Chancellor Keesling. As far as he's concerned, the soldier didn't ""take his own life"" or ""commit suicide."" His son ""died by suicide,"" Keesling insists -- and he has his reasons why. When 25-year old Chancellor Keesling shot himself in Iraq on June 19, his family received much support from the military and local officials. Gregg Keesling's son was given the honor afforded to a fallen service member. The Keesling family went to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to watch as his body was flown back to Indiana six days later. At his burial, seven rifles fired three times each, in true military tradition. Later, the soldier's aunt created a memorial wall in the family's Indianapolis living room. On the wall hangs Spc. Keesling's uniform, the U.S. flag that was handed to his mother, Jannett, after the service and the Indianapolis flag that flew over the state Capitol in his honor. Yet there's an empty spot on the wall for an honor that never arrived: a letter from the president. Gregg Keesling wanted to know why, especially after hearing President Obama talk about how he struggled to write letters to the families of each and every soldier killed in the war. After pressing for an answer, the family found out the truth: There would be no condolence letter. It's a matter of policy dating to the Clinton era, according to the White House. The commander in chief sends such letters to the families of troops who have died in combat, but not if they committed suicide, Gregg was told. The policy felt wrong to Gregg and Jannett Keesling. Their son was a hero, and his country should be proud of him, they said. So Gregg Keesling wrote to Obama and Army Chief of Staff Gen. George W. Casey Jr., imploring them to rethink the policy. ""The recognition of the president could have profound impact on the family of the suicide victim,"" Keesling wrote in August. Read the letters to President Obama . ""The lack of acknowledgment and condolences from the President, who our family admires greatly, leaves us with an emotional vacuum and a feeling that we his family have somehow [made] less of a sacrifice,"" he wrote in another letter to Casey. A White House spokesman said the administration is reviewing the ""inherited"" policy. ""The President's thoughts and prayers are with every military family who has lost a loved one in service to our country. As Commander-in-Chief, he has worked with Secretary Gates and Admiral Mullen to address the mental health needs of our service members,"" spokesman Tommy Vietor wrote in an e-mail. Spc. Keesling completed two tours of duty in Iraq. When he enlisted in 2003, the family struggled with his decision. But the young soldier was convinced that he made the right decision, telling his family, ""We must have a military, and somebody's got to be in it."" Before he deployed 2005, he was anxious but excited, his mother remembered. However, toward the end of his deployment, the stress of a failing marriage and the shock of war ""began to wear on him terribly,"" Gregg Keesling said. In anger, he threw his wedding ring into the Tigris River, his parents said. He was put under suicide watch, and his ammunition was taken away for several days. At home, though, he was ""back to his old self,"" his father said, adding that his son found a job at FedEx and a new girlfriend. He was treated at the Veterans Affairs clinic for a shoulder injury and burn he suffered during his deployment. His parents assumed he was being treated for everything he needed. In 2009, he received new deployment orders . His family suggested that he move to his mother's native Jamaica to avoid service, but the soldier insisted that it was his obligation to see it through, his parents said. When Keesling deployed again, this time as a reservist, he wasn't with his original comrades. Instead, he and 10 other Indiana reserves shipped off with a 300-member unit from Tennessee, with just two months of training together. His mental health records were not passed on either, leaving Spc. Keesling to share his past problems with his unit if he so chose. He never did. ""I understand that, but it is a very big burden to put on a soldier to self-identify,"" Gregg Keesling said. In e-mails to his family, Spc. Keesling wrote about how distant he felt from his new brothers in arms. ""I hate going to war with people I don't know,"" he said to his father. Gregg Keesling said his son struggled with members of his unit who joked about troops who committed suicide, oblivious to his struggles. It became too much to bear. After a long-distance fight with his girlfriend, the soldier said in an e-mail that he wanted to shoot himself. After several phone calls, Spc. Keesling told his mother that he would talk to the Army chaplain. He never did. Instead, 12 hours after that e-mail, he went into a latrine and shot himself. The family believes that his suicide was brought on by the stress of war and the distance from loved ones. To them, it is death by injury like any other incident. ""He died by suicide,"" Gregg said. ""He just had an injury that we just did not recognize."" And that's why they want a letter from the president. ""We don't want to force the president to write a letter of condolence. We hope he would want to,"" Gregg said. ""We hope the president of the United States would want to show the appreciation to a family like ours for the sacrifice we made in allowing our son to become a soldier and defend his country.""","Family of Spc. Chancellor Keesling, 25, wants condolence letter from President Obama .

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- Authorities arrested a man accused of secretly taping ESPN sports reporter Erin Andrews in the nude and posting the videos on the Internet, the FBI said Friday. ESPN reporter Erin Andrews claims someone videotaped her while she was nude and posted video online. Authorities arrested 48-year-old Michael David Barrett at Chicago O'Hare International Airport on Friday. Barrett faces a charge of interstate stalking, the FBI said. Barrett is accused of taping Andrews while she was nude in two hotel rooms. He then made eight videos that he posted on the Internet, the FBI said. Barrett allegedly filmed seven of the eight videos at a hotel room in Nashville, Tennessee, in September 2008. FBI agents said they found evidence that a peephole to the door of Andrews' hotel room had been altered. The FBI learned that Barrett checked into the same hotel at that time and asked for a room adjacent to Andrews using his home address to register for the room. According to a criminal complaint, Barrett tried to sell the videos to celebrity gossip Web site TMZ.com. Employees at the Web site also helped in the investigation providing Barrett's information to Andrews' attorney. Andrews works as a sideline reporter traveling around the country covering college football games. Barrett will have his first court appearance in Chicago at 10 a.m. (11 a.m. ET) Saturday, authorities said. The maximum penalty for the charge of interstate stalking is five years in federal prison, the FBI said. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","Chicago man accused of secretly videotaping ESPN reporter Erin Andrews in nude .

"NASSAU, Bahamas (CNN) -- John Travolta's lawyer testified Tuesday that the paramedic who drove Travolta's son to a hospital the day he died later wanted money for documents the driver suggested could be detrimental to the actor. John Travolta's son died of a seizure in January at the age of 16. Paramedic Tarino Lightbourne and former Bahamian Sen. Pleasant Bridgewater are on trial, accused of plotting to extort $25 million from Travolta after 16-year-old Jett Travolta died from a seizure in the Bahamas. Travolta, who testified last Wednesday, is expected to return to the witness stand later in the week. Travolta's lawyer, Allyson Maynard-Gibson, said Bridgewater approached her in the days after Jett's death on January 2, saying she had a client who had a document Travolta might want. Bridgewater gave her copies of the papers, which included ambulance dispatch reports and a paper signed by Travolta releasing the ambulance company from legal liability, Maynard-Gibson testified. The paramedic expected Travolta would pay millions to prevent publication of the documents because ""he would not want his name tarnished in media,"" Maynard-Gibson said. Bridgewater told Travolta's lawyer that her client believed the documents could suggest that Travolta was negligent by wanting to take his son to his private jet for a flight to a Florida hospital, instead of going directly to a local hospital, she said. Maynard-Gibson said she called police, who then videotaped a hotel room meeting between the paramedic and another Travolta lawyer. Those investigators testified Tuesday, and their video was expected to be played in court later. Travolta's testimony last week was the first time he spoke publicly about his desperate efforts to save his son's life after he suffered a seizure at the family's vacation home in the Bahamas. Travolta and his wife, actress Kelly Preston, have been in seclusion for most of this year. Friends have described their deep grief over Jett's death. Travolta said a nanny found Jett unresponsive at the home on the island of Grand Bahamas, where the family was spending their New Year's holiday. A family friend with a medical background helped in urgent efforts to revive Jett, Travolta said. ""We continued CPR, and my wife was holding his head,"" Travolta said. His wife sat in the Nassau courtroom, sometimes crying as she listened to the testimony. Travolta said he initially told the ambulance driver to rush them to an airport where his private jet was parked. Travolta, who is a pilot, said he wanted to fly his son to a West Palm Beach, Florida, hospital instead of driving him to one in Freeport. The paramedic, however, asked Travolta to sign a statement releasing the ambulance company from liability. ""I received a liability of release document,"" he said. ""I signed it. I did not read it. Time was of the essence."" Travolta said that while he and his wife were riding in the ambulance with their son, they decided to divert to the hospital. At the hospital, Travolta was told his son ""wasn't alive,"" he said.","NEW: Lawyer says defendants used papers to imply negligence in extortion attempt .

"(CNN) -- All-time major record holder Jack Nicklaus believes that Tiger Woods will return to the golf course in time to appear in next month's Masters. Woods, 34, has been out of the game since revelations about his private life were made public late last year but Nicklaus is of the opinion that his fellow- American will want to play at Augusta as he aims to add to his tally of 14 major victories. Speaking to the media before this week's Honda Classic PGA tournament, Nicklaus, who is four ahead of Woods with 18 major wins, said: ""It would surprise me if he didn't play at Augusta. My guess, as a golfer, is that he will want to. ""His personal life is his personal life. He is a professional golfer and he is a sensational golfer. He is a great athlete, and he'll figure out his own problems."" Meanwhile, Woods' caddie Steve Williams has told New Zealand's 60 Minutes program that he would have spoken out about the world number one's alleged affairs if he had known about them. ""In some people's perception, I'm involved in it and I've committed a crime or I've done wrong,"" Williams said. ""The truth is I knew nothing of what was happening."" ""It's been the most difficult time of my life because every single person believed that I should know, or did know, or had something to do with it. ""If I had known something was going on, the whistle would have been blown. ""Of course I'm mad at him. I'm close with his wife  -- he's got two lovely children and he's let them down.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Mozart is trying to win a million dollars for New Orleans recovery efforts. But the charitable effort by the  6-year-old Cavalier King Charles spaniel may be derailed by a dog named after the satirical TV anchorman Stephen Colbert. Mozart's owner says if he wins, all the prize money will go to charities aiding New Orleans. Both canines are contestants in a dog beauty pageant -- but only one pup can take home the big money. The first round is under way, with a hairy finalist selected each week by the number of fan votes. Mozart, or MoMo as friends and family know him, came in second last week in the Cutest Dog Competition with 2,780 votes. This week he is running neck and neck with a new challenger, Stephen Colbert el dos, a Pomeranian Chihuahua mixed-breed puppy from Atlanta, Georgia. MoMo's owner is crying foul. ""It's just coming out of nowhere,"" Cara McCool said. ""It's just unfortunate. MoMo is named after a famous person too, but he's dead."" The Cutest Dog Competition is run by All American Pet Brands. Over 60,000 people have uploaded photos of their adorable dogs to the contest's Web site. The final 12 pooches will get to compete for the grand prize, a cool million in cash. ""It's a fraternity or sorority with people who don't just have pets, these are their family members, their best friends,"" said All American Pet Brands CEO Barry Schwartz. ""He's my furry child,"" said McCool, a New Orleans piano teacher who named her dog Mozart after her favorite composer. ""Sometimes I pull up chairs for him to sit next to me when I play or teach. He has been known to jump on the bench and actually has put his paws on the keys."" McCool has been active with several nonprofits working in New Orleans. If Mozart wins she said all the money will got to several charities: Redeemer Presbyterian Disaster Relief, Desire Street Ministries, Louisiana Teachers Save Our Students fund, Cavalier Rescue USA, Musical Arts Society of New Orleans, the Louisiana SPCA, and Teach for America. ""I already support them, but I can't afford that much because I'm a piano teacher,"" she said. If Mozart wins, all that could change. Colbert el dos' owners did not want to be identified. They told CNN they have only mentioned the contest to a few friends and family members. However, they did post a note about the doggie competition on a Colbert fan site. The owners have not heard from the show but one of the fan sites says Colbert el dos will appear on ""The Colbert Report"" if he makes the top 12. Renata Luczak, a spokesperson for Comedy Central, could not confirm or deny the pet's booking, saying, "" 'The Colbert Report' refrains from commenting on upcoming guests appearing on the show."" Even without a television appearance, Colbert el dos appears to be benefiting from the famous Colbert name bump. Colbert has wreaked havoc in other online competitions -- from a Hungarian bridge-naming contest to a NASA competition to name a room in the International Space Station. In both cases Colbert won the popular vote. However, NASA pushed back and instead of naming the room in his honor, the agency sent a treadmill to space with the Colbert honorific. In both of those contests, the competitions received heavy promotion during the show, with Colbert urging his viewers to participate. However, in this dog photo fight, Colbert is having an impact without any direct participation. Schwartz said the competition recognizes the outside influence of the Colbert bump. ""If there are those Colbert-named dogs that can get those thousands of votes, we don't want to leave anyone out, so we added a new daily contest."" The voting for this week ends at midnight on Saturday. Schwartz said the grand prize winner will be named on Thanksgiving Day.","""Stephen Colbert El Dos"" is causing some snapping over cute dog contest .

"(CNN) -- There are many reasons why Roz Savage is an extraordinary woman -- she has rowed single-handed across the Atlantic and is now tackling the Pacific, after all. Life changer: From successful career to ocean rower, Savage has been an inspiration for many. But her response to everyday commuter ennui is perhaps of the most remarkable things about her. Back in 2000 a 33-year-old Roz was facing another dreary journey by train to the office. She had a great job as a management consultant, money and a husband; but deep down she knew something was missing. So, instead of just burying her feelings, she wrote two obituaries of herself. In one she kept going with life as it was. In the other she took a jump into the unknown and did the things she'd always wanted to. From that moment on her life has never been the same. ""One-by-one, I shed the trappings of my old life,"" she writes on her web site. ""The job, the husband, the home, the little red sports car. I moved house with increasing regularity, wherever I could find cheap or preferably free accommodation. ""Little by little I began to realign my life, to put myself on track for the obituary I really wanted."" Eventually she settled on the challenge that would in many ways define her: rowing the Atlantic single handed. It was, of course, incredibly hard, both physically and mentally. She had done some rowing while at the University of Oxford -- but the open ocean was a different challenge altogether. But she emerged a tougher, happier person on the other side, and is now deep into her new attempt to row the Pacific, a journey she hopes to use to raise awareness of environmental issues. The courage she has found, both to take on the might of the open ocean and give up safe, conventional notions of success to pursue her dreams has made Roz a hero to many people that hope to find inspiration in her life -- including a large number of CNN.com readers who have nominated her as a ""Green Inspiration"". ""I feel a little embarrassed about it -- that must be the British in me!"" she told CNN from the middle of the Pacific Ocean. ""I certainly don't see myself as any kind of hero, just a human being trying to be the best human she can be. But at the same time I want to reach out to as many people as I can, because I wish I'd had more positive role models to show me how good life can be, and if I can inspire just a few people to change their lives for the better, I'll feel I've lived a very blessed life."" Rowing across the Pacific Ocean . On her journey she keeps the many people following her up to date with regular blog posts on her website. Posts range from the personal to the global, the reality of life on the open waves to plastic pollution, the North Pacific Garbage Patch, and how people could reduce the amount of waste they generate. ""I try to offer my life as an example of what can be done when a very ordinary person decides to do something out of the ordinary,"" she said. ""I love my life, and want to show people how much fun it can be when you get out there and grab life by the horns. It would be very selfish of me to keep this fantastic discovery to myself! ""Every time I get a comment on my blog from someone who says they have changed their life as a result of reading about me and my adventures -- anything from composting their kitchen scraps to quitting their job to start out on an adventure of their own -- it gives me a huge warm glow of accomplishment. And it makes me feel even better when they tell me how much fun they are having doing it. Because that is what life is all about."" But adventure doesn't have to involve months alone in a rowing boat, with only sea birds, the sun and the wind for company. ""Everybody is different, and will find their own way,"" she said. ""For me, at the time when I decided to row oceans, I felt the need for a dramatic contrast to the very conventional life I'd had before, and ocean rowing seemed to fit the bill. I do think that you learn things about yourself in extreme situations that you wouldn't learn in less testing circumstances. ""But the situation doesn't have to be physically extreme. Parenthood, starting a new business, moving to a new town or a new country -- these are all ways to put yourself in a challenging new environment where you have to throw away your old preconceptions about what is or is not possible, and try out new approaches."" Ever action has an effect . Roz's advice for anyone stuck in a rut is don't be afraid to fail. If you know what you want to do, then don't be intimidated. Write a list of what you can do to achieve your goals. If there seems to be things on it you can't do yet, then Roz says it isn't detailed enough -- any task can be broken down into achievable steps. ""Everything is a learning experience if you allow it to be. I keep a journal -- on land and at sea -- and this really helps me to learn from my experiences,"" she said. At the core of her mission in the Pacific is a belief that we can not only transform our own lives through our actions, but our relationship to the natural world around us as well. ""There has been so much bad news about environmental issues that I think some people feel overwhelmed,"" she said. ""But there is something we can all do to make a difference -- and it all adds up. ""It's about more than just using a re-usable bag, or picking up a piece of trash from a beach. It's about an attitude and a way of thinking. ""Every action has effects beyond the action itself -- other people will see what you are doing and follow your example. It's the ripple effect. And if we all pull together, we can make a world of difference."" Fundamentally, her message is that life is for living and we learn as much from failure as success if we are open-minded and positive. ""My life now is so much more fulfilling and fun, and I'm incredibly glad I took that leap of faith. There is nothing special about me that made me able to do it. If I can do it, anybody can -- if they want to. ""Get out there, live life large, make the world a better place -- and have fun!""

"Santiago, Chile (CNN) -- Chile marks three days of mourning starting Sunday, with every house authorized to hang the national flag in memory of those who perished in a massive earthquake a week ago. Hundreds of people died when the 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck on February 27. It also triggered a tsunami that toppled buildings, particularly in the Maule region along the coast. The death toll was lowered Thursday as authorities reviewed discrepancies in the reported number of victims in the Maule region. To limit confusion, Deputy Interior Minister Patricio Rosende read aloud the names of 279 Chileans whose bodies had been identified by Thursday evening. The new tally does not account for hundreds of unidentified victims. Full coverage of Chile earthquake, aftermath . ""It takes months sometimes to compile the information, because one of the biggest problems in the affected areas is the lack of precision and uncertainty at the scene,"" Rosende said. Aid poured in for Chile from home and overseas, with a local television station hoping to raise $27 million by Saturday night and the United Nations pledging money toward recovery efforts. ""Chile Helps Chile,"" a telethon that started Friday, ran until Saturday night. It was unclear whether it had reached its goal early Sunday. United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon pledged up to $10 million for relief and recovery efforts during a two-day visit that included a visit with Chilean President Michelle Bachelet. ""I am visiting this city with a deep sadness,"" Ban said Saturday in Concepcion. ""Standing before this destruction, I can feel for your loss, your struggle."" Shocking scenes hours after quake . Ban also announced a team effort between U.N. agencies and the Chilean government to determine the priority areas for funds, with emphasis on health, shelters, education and water. The secretary-general plans to bring the matter in front of the United Nations on his return. The Chilean government has asked the United Nations for items such as field hospitals with surgical facilities, dialysis centers, generators, saltwater purifying systems, mobile bridges and field kitchens. The United States has also sent in help, including 71 satellite phones and mobile water treatment units, the State Department said. Six more water treatment units are to arrive within a week. A field hospital and two C-130 aircraft to assist with moving supplies around the country have also been deployed. The United States also sent $1 million to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies to aid their efforts.","Three days of national mourning for victims of Chile earthquake starts on Sunday .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani soldiers and militants battled Saturday in the country's vast tribal region, with more than a dozen insurgents killed in airstrikes, at least four soldiers slain in skirmishes and a key village seized by troops, the military said. A Pakistani soldier pictured during operations against militants in June. The fatalities come hours after Pakistani troops launched a massive ground offensive backed up by air power targeting the Taliban in South Waziristan, a refuge and a power base for insurgents operating in Pakistan and along the Pakistani-Afghan border. The highly anticipated offensive, which comes after a wave of suicide attacks in Pakistan, also has prompted the exodus of tens of thousands of civilians, the U.N. refugee agency said. One military official said Pakistani troops seized control of Kotkai, where Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud has lived with fellow commander Qari Hussein, the mastermind behind some of Pakistan's deadliest suicide attacks.  Watch how the offensive began » . Another military official said the airstrikes from jet fighters and helicopter gunships targeted militant hideouts in Kotkai and the villages of Badar, Barwand and Khisur, all strongholds of the Taliban and their late leader Baitullah Mehsud. The official asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media. There have been confrontations throughout the day between soldiers and militants. Along with the four slain soldiers, 12 have been wounded, the military said. Gen. Athar Abbas, the Pakistan military spokesman, said the ground offensive in South Waziristan was launched shortly after midnight after the military received clearance from the government. He said the region's eight entry and exit points have been sealed by troops. Pakistani officials say that about 10,000 to 15,000 militants linked to the Taliban or to al Qaeda operate in South Waziristan, a harsh terrain familiar to militants but difficult for others to navigate. About 28,000 Pakistani soldiers have moved into the epicenter of Taliban activity in the region to counter their activities, officials said. Elsewhere in Pakistan's tribal region, in the Mohmand Agency, at least eight militants and one soldier were killed Saturday when they exchanged gunfire near a military checkpoint, the military said. For months, the military had been targeting militant hideouts in South Waziristan and other hot spots in Pakistan's tribal areas. This year, troops launched a large operation targeting militants in the Swat Valley, in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province. But despite these efforts, insurgents have continued to strike with relative impunity inside Pakistan, brazenly targeting government, police and security locations. The latest attack occurred Friday in the northern city of Peshawar, when a suicide car bomber detonated near a police station, killing 13 people, most of them civilians. The recent wave of deadly attacks has raised concerns about the ability of Pakistan's security forces to maintain control. The attacks heightened internal and international pressure on the government to take swift and effective action. In a high-level meeting Friday, army chief Gen. Ashfaq Kayani ""gave a detailed briefing on the prevailing national security situation and its ramifications in the future,"" according to a statement from the prime minister's office. Those who attended the meeting condemned the recent attacks and ""agreed that these elements pose a serious threat to the sovereignty and integrity of the state,"" the statement said. The attacks show ""once again that the militants in Pakistan threaten both Pakistan and the United States,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Bill Burton said. On Thursday, President Obama approved an additional $7.5 billion in assistance to Pakistan over the next five years.","NEW: Official says troops take village of Kotkai .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama will announce the U.S. troop strategy for Afghanistan in a speech at 8 p.m. ET Tuesday at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Wednesday. In the speech, Obama will explain why the United States is in Afghanistan, its interests there and his decision-making process, Gibbs said, but ""the president does not see this as an open-ended engagement. ""Our time there will be limited, and I think that's important for people to understand,"" he said. ""We are in year nine"" in Afghanistan, Gibbs told reporters. ""We're not going to be there another eight or nine years."" Obama will meet with members of Congress at the White House on Tuesday afternoon before the speech. Cost issues are among the topics the president will address, Gibbs said. ""It's a million dollars a troop for a year,"" he said. ""Ten thousand troops is $10 billion. That's in addition to what we already spend in Afghanistan and Pakistan. That also does not include training, and it doesn't include the maintaining of a security force. It's very, very, very expensive."" But, Gibbs added, ""I think the president, throughout this process, has talked about the cost in terms of American lives and in terms of the cost to our treasury, and I think he'll continue to talk about it."" The president ordered more than 20,000 additional troops to Afghanistan in March. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, reportedly has called for up to 40,000 more to wage a counterinsurgency campaign against the Taliban, the Islamic militia originally ousted by U.S. military action in 2001. Obama has weighed several options for bolstering the American contingent, ranging from sending a few thousand troops to the 40,000 McChrystal requested. A defense official told CNN earlier this week the Pentagon is making detailed plans to send about 34,000 more troops to Afghanistan in anticipation of Obama's decision on the 8-year-old war. There had been no final word on Obama's decision as of Tuesday, said the Defense Department official, who has direct knowledge of the process. But the official said planners have been tasked with preparing to send 34,000 additional American troops to Afghanistan with the expectation that Obama was leaning toward approving that many. iReporters sound off; share your views on sending more troops in Afghanistan . Defense Secretary Robert Gates is expected to receive the paperwork Thursday to approve orders to deploy 1,000 Marines from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, to Afghanistan in late December -- the first of the new troops to be sent, a U.S. military official told CNN on Wednesday. The official is not authorized to talk about the plans because they have not been officially announced. The 1,000 Marines are part of a battalion task force that has been preparing and training for the deployment, the official said. The president held a lengthy meeting with top advisers Monday night, and he told reporters Tuesday that he would announce new plans for Afghanistan after Thanksgiving. McChrystal took part in the meeting Monday, along with Vice President Joe Biden, Gates, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen and Karl Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador in Kabul, Afghanistan. Obama said Tuesday that the deliberations had been ""comprehensive and extremely useful."" ""It's going to be important to recognize that in order for us to succeed there [in Afghanistan], you've got to have a comprehensive strategy that includes civilian and diplomatic efforts,"" he said at a news conference Tuesday with visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The defense official said Tuesday that the military is planning to send three U.S. Army brigades, totaling about 15,000 troops; a Marine brigade with about 8,000 troops; a headquarters element of about 7,000; and between 4,000 and 5,000 support troops -- a total of about 34,000 troops. CNN reported last month that this was the Pentagon's preferred option. However, the official said Wednesday that the Marines are expected to deploy 8,000 combat, aviation and support troops, plus 1,000 to 1,500 Marines as part of a headquarters unit -- a total of between 9,000 and 9,500. They will be in addition to the 11,000 Marines already in Afghanistan. After the first deployment, the remaining Marines will deploy over the next three to four months, the military official said. The troops would be dispatched throughout Afghanistan but would be focused mainly on the southern and southeastern provinces, where much of the recent fighting has taken place. Currently, brigades from Fort Drum in upstate New York and Fort Campbell in Kentucky are among those next in line to deploy. About 68,000 U.S. troops are in Afghanistan, along with about 45,000 from the NATO alliance. Two U.S. military officials have told CNN that NATO countries would be asked to contribute more troops to fill the gap between the 34,000 the Pentagon expects Obama to send and the 40,000 McChrystal wants. The request is expected to come during a December 7 meeting at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will travel to Brussels next week to meet with allies, State Department sources told CNN. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell would not discuss specific numbers, but he said NATO would be asked for additional help. Obama's Afghanistan plan will include ""very broad terms"" that show how and where the United States is succeeding in the nation, a senior U.S. military official told CNN. Those points will be used to determine how and when troops can be brought home. Another senior military official said McChrystal will take his orders from Obama and will do the best he can with what he has. The question, he said, is not the number of troops, but is whether the United States has ""the right resources to do what we need to do."" ""We can't just go and blow people up and win this war,"" the official said. ""We have to gain the trust of the people, and that is a major part of the plan here."" U.S.-led troops invaded Afghanistan in response to the al Qaeda terrorist network's September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. The invasion overthrew the ruling Taliban, which had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory -- but most of the top al Qaeda and Taliban leadership escaped the onslaught. Taliban fighters have since regrouped to the mountainous region along Afghanistan's border with Pakistan, battling U.S. and Afghan government forces on one side and Pakistani troops on the other. Al Qaeda's top leaders, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, remain at large and are suspected to be hiding in the same region. The conflict has so far claimed the lives of more than 900 Americans and nearly 600 allied troops. CNN's Jill Dougherty, Deirdre Walsh, Elaine Quijano and Mike Mount contributed to this report.","Obama to explain why U.S. is in Afghanistan, its interests there and how he made decision .

"(CNN) -- The California runner who was lost in a forest for three days without water had barely a few hours to go before she would have died, her doctor said Thursday. Runner Maria ""Gina"" Natero-Armenta, 36, survived for three days without water in a California forest. Maria ""Gina"" Natero-Armento, 36, not only survived 72 hours with only a slice of apple in her stomach and a little bit of water for nourishment, she also has only one functioning kidney, Dr. Derrick Hong said. He spoke with CNN on Thursday afternoon, along with Natero-Armento and her husband, Armando Armento, in a conference call interview from her room at Mission Hospital in Mission Viejo, California. Natero-Armento is no amateur when it comes to distance or mountain running. She's one of the top female finishers in a San Diego 100-mile race and an experienced ultrarunner with top times in other 100-mile and 50-mile races. Her body was unusually strong to begin with, but she also has one kidney -- the other doesn't function because of a congenital disorder. ""This is extraordinary,"" Hung said. She said she had planned a simple eight-mile run, a small fraction of what the ultrarunner usually tackles in a sport that challenges competitors to run at least farther than a 26.2-mile marathon. She is among the majority of ultrarunners who like doing 100-mile races. She set out from her Oceanside home at 5:30 a.m. Sunday to meet Fidel Diaz, her running partner and brother-in-law, who is also a serious ultrarunner. They planned to run along a trail in the the Cleveland National Forest near San Diego. She brought along two water bottles and wore a Camelpak, a backpack that can be filled with water. That was plenty of water for an eight-mile outing. She didn't bring food with her, but Natero-Armento said she ate a piece of apple before she started, and that was the only food in her stomach. Natero-Armento said she did several things that were out of character that day, and she wishes she had been more prepared. ""I am very careful usually, but that particular day, I was not,"" she said. ""I normally, the night before the long runs, I have everything ready. And this night, I had nothing ready, and it was just a mistake."" She usually wears a Garmin GPS watch, a sophisticated device that runners use to find out where they are, the distance they have traveled, calories burned and altitude. ""I didn't have my Garmin and wasn't wearing a watch,"" she said. ""I don't know. I always carry food with me, and I didn't have nearly enough."" ""I always carry my phone with me, and I didn't have my phone with me, and that really was a big mistake,"" she said. Feeling antsy to just get on the trail and run, she wasn't thinking deliberately. ""I just wanted to get going that day; get some fresh air and go for a run. I hurried up."" Natero-Armento and Diaz began running about 6:30 a.m. Sunday, she said. She lost track of as much as eight hours, she said, as she and Diaz became lost. By then, she was dehydrated and disoriented. And Natero-Armento said she also made another, more serious bad decision. At some point in the run, Diaz had become ill. Ultrarunning is a sport in which some participants sometimes push themselves way too hard. ""[He was] pretty much beside me or in front of me, but I do know that I was insisting on keeping going since I was OK,"" she said. ""He doesn't eat or drink much ever [when out on runs], so I know he can handle that."" She said that she kept going because she'd seen him run hard while sick -- also not uncommon in 50- and 100-mile races -- and that she figured he could handle it if she pushed him. She said they became separated as they two were going over a rugged hill. ""We had separated because we were going through a hill quite a while and had to go through brush, and that's how I have a lot of scrapes. So that was very difficult,"" she said. ""[We] crawl under and break branches, and that was the only way we were going to get out of there, according to Fidel. So I don't think he was able to see that I was not there anymore."" She said that Diaz was in front of her. He would shout to her so they knew the other one was close by: He shouted to her, and she shouted back. Then, at one point, she couldn't hear him anymore. ""When I called him and he didn't answer, at this point, I lost a little bit of control,"" she said. Night turned into day. She had no water or food, and she didn't try to eat anything. She became disoriented but had the wherewithal to know that she was completely out of fuel. She didn't have the strength to keep walking, so she climbed into a ravine, believing that would be the safest place. Diaz was not available for an interview Thursday. He was found Wednesday several hours before she was. It's not clear why he was lost for so long and where, for days, he had traveled in the forest. Rather than ask for water, law enforcement said, Diaz asked how Natero-Armento was doing and if someone had found her. ""I really had to, from the beginning, accept that I was not capable of getting out of there, there was no where to go,"" she said, recalling her hours in the ravine, thinking about her husband and her family. She told herself she would live. ""I knew what I had to do."" The experience has not scared her away from distance running on trails. When her kidney is strong again, she will be back, running.","Maria ""Gina"" Natero-Armento, 36, had no food or water for days .

"Dubai, United Arab Emirates (CNN) -- Mourners buried a senior Hamas militant Friday after his recent death in Dubai -- a death Hamas calls an ""assassination."" Mahmoud al-Mabhouh died in Dubai on January 20, said Izzat al Rishq, a Hamas member based in Syria. Al-Mabhouh was a founding member of the military wing of Hamas, which blamed Israel for his death. ""We hold the enemy responsible for the assassination of Mahmoud Mabhouh,"" the militant wing said in an online statement. ""The enemy will not escape punishment."" It said Al-Mabhouh was responsible for capturing two Israeli soldiers during the first intifada and named the pair: Sgt. Avi Sasportas and Cpl. Ilan Saadon . The Israeli Foreign Ministry said Sasportas was kidnapped on Feb. 16, 1989 and shot to death. His body was found in May 1989. The ministry said the same Hamas terror cell that kidnapped Sasportas abducted Saadon on May 3, 1989. Saadon's body was discovered in 1996. Government officials in Israel declined to comment on the militant wing's statement. One official in Dubai told CNN that al-Mabhouh died of natural causes. But the Emirates News Agency said authorities determined that the man was killed and were working with Interpol to hunt down alleged perpetrators thought to be part of a ""criminal gang,"" some of whom have European passports. Hamas said it is investigating the death and that it would publish details ""in a timely manner."" Al-Mabhouh's brother, Fayek al-Mabhouh, said that preliminary results of Hamas' investigation show he was killed by electrocution and strangulation with a piece of cloth. Fayek said his brother had survived other assassination attempts. The Emirates News Agency report quoted a security source saying the gang had been tracking the victim. Al-Mabhouh had lived in Syria for about 20 years. He traveled from Syria to Dubai on January 19 and died the next day, Hamas officials in Gaza said. It's not clear why he traveled to Dubai, but Fayek al-Mabhouh said his brother arrived at a Dubai hotel in charge of the Hamas mission. His body was returned to Damascus on Thursday night and was buried after Friday prayers, Hamas officials in Gaza said.

"Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- Just taking a sip of water or walking to the bathroom is excruciatingly painful for 15-year-old Michael Brewer, who was burned over 65 percent of his body after being set on fire, allegedly by a group of teenagers. ""It hurts my heart to see him in pain, but it enlightens at the same time to know my son is strong enough to make it through on a daily basis,"" his mother, Valerie Brewer, told CNN on Wednesday. Brewer and her husband, Michael Brewer, Sr., spoke to CNN's Tony Harris, a day after a 13-year-old boy who witnessed last month's attack publicly read a written statement: . ""I want to express my deepest sympathy to Mikey and his family,"" Jeremy Jarvis said. ""I will pray for Mikey to grow stronger every day and for Mikey's speedy recovery."" Jarvis' older brother has been charged in the October 12 attack in Deerfield Beach, Florida. When asked about the teen's statement, Valerie Brewer -- who knows the Jarvis family -- said she ""can't focus on that."" ""I would really like to stay away from that because that brings negative energy to me and I don't need that right now,"" she said. Her son remains in guarded condition at the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center. He suffered second- and third-degree burns over about two-thirds of his body, according to the hospital's associate director, Dr. Carl Schulman. The teen faces a lifelong recovery from his injuries, Schulman told CNN's Harris. ""Michael's still got a lot of major surgery ahead of him, a lot of rehabilitation and therapy,"" Schulman said. ""He's doing about as well as could be expected at this point in his recovery, but he's got a period of probably several weeks to a couple of months still left in the hospital if everything goes well, but the recovery is lifelong. This is truly a life-changing event."" Valerie Brewer said her son's treatment is excruciating at times. Physical therapy, she said, is ""incredibly painful. He almost cries because it's so painful. He's burned badly on the backs of his knees and every time he moves his knee, it pulls, and if it's healing, it pulls the scab and it cracks, and it starts to bleed."" The boy must undergo hour-and-a-half showers, she said, where ""they take a piece of gauze, and they wipe off all the dead skin. They give him painkillers for that, but it's incredibly painful and it breaks my heart every time they have to do it. ... That's what we call the torture hour."" Heavy metal musician Ozzy Osbourne sent Brewer a CD, and he plays it on a boom box during the showers, she said. ""He focuses on Ozzy, and he gets through his torture hour."" Police were able to interview Brewer on Monday for the first time since the incident. Hospital officials have said Brewer can communicate only in one- or two-word answers. Valerie Brewer would not go into details about what her son told investigators, but said that ""he answered the questions they asked."" The interview was emotional for both the teen and the investigators, according to Maria Schneider, a prosecutor with the state attorney's office in Broward County. ""It was difficult for him to talk about. Difficult for us to listen to,"" she said of the interview. ""Just difficult all around, heart-wrenching. He's doing so much better, but it's such a terrible situation."" Denver Jarvis and Matthew Bent, both 15, are accused along with a third teen, Jesus Mendez, 16, of being in a group that poured alcohol over Brewer and set him ablaze in a dispute over $40, a video game and a bicycle. All three pleaded not guilty in an appearance last week in Broward County Circuit Court. If convicted, they would face a sentence of up to 30 years in prison. Detectives say eyewitnesses told them that Mendez used a lighter to set fire to Brewer after Jarvis allegedly poured alcohol over him. Bent allegedly encouraged the attack, police said. Brewer jumped into a pool at his apartment complex to put out the flames. Authorities have said Mendez admitted setting Brewer on fire. According to an arrest transcript, the boy said he made a ""bad decision."" Jeremy Jarvis was arrested as a juvenile after Brewer was burned and spent about 30 days in juvenile detention. However, prosecutors have not filed charges against him and are still determining how to proceed. He still could be charged, as prosecutors have 90 days from his arrest to decide whether to move forward with the case. He has not been interviewed by police or prosecutors, Schneider said. ""He has invoked his rights to counsel and has invoked his rights to silence,"" she said. The boy's attorney, Stephen Melnick, said it appears the younger Jarvis was only a witness to the attack. Broward County schools expelled the seventh-grader after his arrest and he is currently being home-schooled, Melnick said. He described his client was a good friend of Brewer, and said the boy is troubled by Brewer's injuries as well as by his brother facing criminal charges that could land him in an adult prison if convicted. Valerie Brewer said it was ""heartbreaking"" when she and her husband learned that her son's attackers may have included kids that they knew. ""But we don't focus on that,"" she added. ""We focus strictly on Michael and his recovery. We don't need any negative energy coming into the recovery so we just stay away from it, period. We don't watch the news because we're living this nightmare and we don't need to see it on the TV. So we just stay away from it and stay positive for Michael."" Her son's recovery has been filled with ups and downs, she said. ""It's been a roller coaster ride, the fear of the unknown,"" she said. ""The first time he spoke to us was joyous but watching him struggle every single day ... ""I'm proud of him, I'm very, very proud of him, 'cause I don't think I could do what he's doing.""

"DOVER, England (CNN) -- As the ferries dock at the Port of Dover after crossing the English Channel, the trucks pull in at a steady rate. Afghanistan's opium harvest can be traced right back to some of those trucks. Afghanistan is the world's biggest supplier of illegal opium, which is made from the seed pods of poppies. ""The routes are many and varied, the concealments are many and varied, we see body [concealment], we see what you call stuffers and swallowers, internal concealments,"" says Steve Coates, deputy director of Britain's Serious Organized Crime Agency. ""They're one step ahead of us and we're desperately trying to get one step ahead of them and I think it's a long game,"" he said. Coates has spent almost 25 years tracking the heroin pipeline. But he says the approach over the last few years is more intelligence-led. ""If we seize the powder, the commodity, they very quickly replace it. The financial flow is much more important. If you can hit the gangs, the proceeds of crime, you really are affecting them, you're reaching right into them and actually impacting them,"" says Coates.  Watch how the Afghan drug pipeline is difficult to stop » . A new United Nations report confirms the status of the lawless and fertile lands of southern Afghanistan as the world's biggest supplier of illegal opium, the addictive narcotic that is made from the seed pods of poppies. The drug is ravaging the young, poor and vulnerable in Afghanistan, and its proceeds are the lifeblood of the Taliban. It also is spreading on a drug trail that spans the world. While Western governments have for years debated how to stop the lucrative drug trade in Afghanistan, the business has only grown. The U.N. report notes that for years, the counternarcotics strategies around the world have failed to have any real effect on addiction or drug trafficking. In some countries, heroin is 10 times cheaper now than it was 30 years ago. ""We've been very good in the past at playing cops and robbers, but did [that] make a difference? No it didn't,"" concedes Coates. The key now, say law enforcement officials, isn't wiping out the poppies, scanning every truck or locking up the small-time dealers, but rather gathering intelligence that follows and then destroys the lucrative money trail. Britain's Serious Organized Crime Agency says it is now committed to taking a collaborative approach not just with its own national partners, but by working intelligence links through the world.","Port of Dover serves as entry point for much of Afghanistan's opium harvest .

"(CNN) -- Hundred's of fans and former teammates of Robert Enke gathered to lay flowers and light candles outside of Hannover 96's Niedersachsen Stadion after the club's German goalkeeper was struck and killed by a train on Tuesday, in what police called an apparent suicide. Enke, 32, died around 6:25 p.m. (12:25 p.m. ET), Hannover police press officer Stefan Wittke said in a statement. ""Preliminary police investigations indicate a suicide,"" Wittke said. Police did not elaborate on what evidence they had that pointed to suicide, but Enke's close friend and advisor Jorg Neblung told the official Web site of football's world governing body FIFA: ""I can confirm that it was suicide. Robert took his own life shortly before six o'clock."" The team's official Web site has been converted into a single-page memorial. Enke captained Hannover 96, a team who currently lie tenth in Germany's Bundesliga top division,  and had been capped by his national side eight times after making his debut aged 29. The shot-stopper had also appeared for teams including Carl Zeiss Jena, Borussia Monchengladbach, Benfica, Barcelona, Fenerbahce and Tenerife in Spain. His teammates were stunned by news of his death. ""We are in a state of shock,"" said team manager Oliver Bierhoff in a statement from the German Football Federation. ""It is beyond words."" The German Football Federation (DFB) said Enke always said he wanted to play for the national team at the 2010 World Cup. Soccer commentator and journalist Rafael Honigstein told CNN International that Enke was on course to be picked as the number-one choice for the team. Enke had missed Germany's last four matches because of a bacterial infection, but had recently returned to action with Hannover. ""The leadership of the German national team never had any doubt that he was important for the team both as a goalkeeper and as a human being,"" the DFB statement said. Enke is survived by his wife and eight-month-old daughter, who the couple adopted. The couple's two-year-old daughter died in 2006 from a heart condition, and Honigstein said the loss of his child had taken a toll on Enke. ""It's been well documented that he had a tough time,"" Honigstein said. ""People knew it was a terrible, terrible tragedy for him."" ""I don't know why and how this happened,"" said Martin Kind, the chairman of Hannover 96. ""It is a total catastrophe. I am finding it hard to understand. All I can say for sure is that it had nothing to do with football."" Fellow players said they believed that Enke had been suffering depression. ""He was unstable,"" said Mr Kind. ""But he kept it under wraps."" The coach of Germany's national team, Joachim Lowe, had been preparing his squad for their friendly game against Chile this weekend. The DFB have not yet confirmed whether the game would still be played. A press conference is due to be held by the DFB at 1130 GMT, while Hannover 96 will speak to the media at 1200 GMT on Wednesday. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.","Germany international footballer Robert Enke has died at the age of 32 at a rail crossing .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Supreme Court voiced deep free speech concerns Tuesday about a law designed to stop the sale and marketing of videos showing dog fights and other acts of animal cruelty. Selling depictions of animal cruelty like this amateur dogfighting video may be illegal under a 1999 statute. The justices heard an hour of lively debate about the scope and intent of the decade-old statute that supporters say has done much to stop the spread of profiting from the torture and abuse of animals. But media groups and the National Rifle Association were among those who say the law is overly broad. ""It's not up to the government to decide what are people's worst instincts,"" said Justice Antonin Scalia. ""One can contemplate a lot of other areas, where government could say: You are appealing to people's worst instincts, and, therefore, movies cannot be made"" showing dramatized depictions of animals being abused, for example. ""What about people who like to see human sacrifices?"" asked Justice Samuel Alito, somewhat sarcastically. ""Suppose that is legally taking place someplace in the world. I mean, people here would probably love to see it. Live, pay-per-view, you know, on the Human Sacrifice Channel. They have a point of view they want to express. That's okay?"" He seemed to indicate strongly it was not, and that lawmakers would have discretion to block it. The specific case before the court dealt with tapes showing pit bull dogs attacking other animals and one another in staged confrontations. Watch an excerpt of the tapes » . A federal appeals court had thrown out the conviction of Robert Stevens, a Pittsville, Virginia, man who sold videos through his ""Dogs of Velvet and Steel"" business. According to court records, undercover federal agents found he was advertising his tapes in ""Sporting Dog Journal,"" an underground magazine on illegal dogfighting. Among the products Stevens advertised was ""Catch Dogs,"" featuring pit bulls chasing wild boars on organized hunts and a ""gruesome depiction of a pit bull attacking the lower jaw of a domestic farm pig,"" according to the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based appeals court. Stevens was charged in 2004 with violating interstate commerce laws by selling depictions of animal cruelty. He was later sentenced to 37 months in prison, and promptly appealed. He argued his sentence was longer than the 14 months given professional football player Michael Vick, who ran an illegal dogfighting ring. It was the first prosecution in the United States to proceed to trial under the 1999 law. The divided appeals court concluded that when it came to the federal law in question, ""research and empirical evidence in the record before us simply does not support the notion that banning depictions of animal cruelty is a necessary or even particularly effective means of prosecuting underlying acts of animal cruelty."" Nearly every state and local jurisdiction have their own laws banning mistreatment of wild and domesticated animals. Several media organizations have come out in support of Stevens, worrying the federal law was too broad and could implicate reports about deer hunting, and depictions of bull-fighting in Ernest Hemingway novels. A number of justices too had concerns, raising a number of hypotheticals, a possible sign a majority of the court remains uncomfortable with allowing the law to be reinstated. ""Why not do a simpler thing?"" suggested Justice Stephen Breyer. ""Rather than let the public guess as to what these words mean, ask Congress to write a statute that actually aims at those frightful things that it was trying to prohibit. Now, that can be done."" ""You have to look at the content to determine whether or not the speech is prohibited,"" said Chief Justice John Roberts. ""How can you tell these aren't political videos? With organizations like PETA [People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals] and others, depictions of the same sort of animal cruelty that is used to generate support for efforts to prohibit it. Why aren't these videos the exact opposite of efforts to legalize it?"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor questioned the distinction between Stevens' videos and news items. ""Tell me what the difference is between these videos and [filmmaker] David Roma's documentary on pit bulls? I mean, David Roma's documentary had much, much more footage on the actual animal cruelty than the films at issue here, greater sections of the film, and more explicit,"" she said. Roma's 2006 independent film ""Off the Chain"" consisted of a great deal of hidden camera footage. Among the wide-ranging hypotheticals raised by the justices over what the law could forbid included: fox hunts, pate de foie gras from geese, cock fighting, bullfighting, shooting deer out of season, even Roman gladiator battles. Neal Katyal, an attorney for the Justice Department, said the law was ""narrowly targeted"" and had exceptions specifically for ""religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value."" ""This statute has nothing to do with the offense of the message. It has to do with trying to dry up an underlying market for animal cruelty,"" said Katyal. Justice Samuel Alito appeared most supportive of the government's views. He asked about selling of so-called ""crush"" videos, in which women -- with their faces unseen -- are shown stomping helpless animals such as rabbits to death with spiked-heel shoes or with their bare feet. ""The people who produce 'crush' videos think they have a message, and the message is that this is sexually exciting,"" he said, clearly uncomfortable with the subject matter. When Stevens' lawyer Patricia Millett launched into a caveat-laden answer, Alito broke in. ""You are not even willing to say that this could be prohibited?"" he asked. ""Because we are trying to determine whether this is overly broad. And this is the category of activity that Congress particularly targeted."" Congressional supporters said a principal motivation for passing the law was to stop the growing popularity of ""crush"" videos. The Humane Society said the market for such videos stopped almost completely after the law was passed. Millett said ""Congress has a job to write with a scalpel and not a buzz saw in the First Amendment area."" She noted that if the law is upheld, it would only be the second time the Supreme Court has identified a form of speech undeserving of protection by the First Amendment. The justices in 1982 banned the distribution of child pornography. ""The problem in this case, was that Congress chose to attack speech and to control what the people of this country could see and hear before it was even seriously punishing the conduct at issue and that gets our Constitution upside down,"" Millett told reporters later. The government had argued a ""compelling interest"" in stopping people who would profit from dog attack tapes and similar depictions. The case is U.S. vs. Stevens (08-769) and a ruling is expected in several months.","The justices heard an hour of debate about scope and intent of decade-old statute .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- At least 6,000 Christians have fled the northern Iraqi city of Mosul in the past week because of killings and death threats, Iraq's Ministry of Immigration and Displaced Persons said Thursday. A Christian family that fled Mosul found refuge in the Al-Sayida monastery about 30 miles north of the city. The number represents 1,424 families, at least 70 more families than were reported to be displaced on Wednesday. The ministry said it had set up an operation room to follow up sending urgent aid to the displaced Christian families as a result of attacks by what it called ""terrorist groups."" Iraqi officials have said the families were frightened by a series of killings and threats by Muslim extremists ordering them to convert to Islam or face death. Fourteen Christians have been slain in the past two weeks in the city, which is about 260 miles (420 kilometers) north of Baghdad. Mosul is one of the last Iraqi cities where al Qaeda in Iraq has a significant presence and routinely carries out attacks. The U.S. military said it killed the Sunni militant group's No. 2 leader, Abu Qaswarah, in a raid in the northern city earlier this month. In response to the recent attacks on Christians, authorities have ordered more checkpoints in several of the city's Christian neighborhoods. The attacks may have been prompted by Christian demonstrations ahead of provincial elections, which are to be held by January 31, authorities said. Hundreds of Christians took to the streets in Mosul and surrounding villages and towns, demanding adequate representation on provincial councils, whose members will be chosen in the local elections. Thursday, Iraq's minister of immigration and displaced persons discussed building housing complexes for Christian families in northern Iraq and allocating land to build the complexes. Abdel Samad Rahman Sultan brought up the issue when he met with a representative of Iraq's Hammurabi Organization for Human Rights and with the head of the Kojina Organization for helping displaced persons. A curfew was declared Wednesday in several neighborhoods of eastern Mosul as authorities searched for militants behind the attacks. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","More than 1,400 Christian families displaced .

"(CNN) -- A terrorist group might be planning attacks on oil tankers in the Strait of Malacca, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, Singapore's navy warned Thursday. ""The terrorists' intent is probably to achieve widespread publicity and showcase that it remains a viable group,"" said an advisory issued by the Singapore Navy Information Fusion Centre (IFC). ""However, this information does not preclude possible attacks on other large vessels with dangerous cargo,"" the advisory said. The IFC recommended that ships strengthen security measures. It did not name any groups or indicate how the tip was obtained. Located between Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, the Strait of Malacca links the Indian Ocean to the South China Sea and Pacific Ocean and is the shortest sea route between Persian Gulf oil suppliers and Asian markets, according to the U.S. government's Energy Information Administration. The agency estimates that more than 15 million barrels of oil are transported through the strait every day. At its narrowest point, the strait is only 1.7 miles wide, which creates a natural bottleneck and makes it vulnerable to terrorist attack. The IFC warned tanker crews to be on the lookout for smaller vehicles -- including dinghies, sampans and speedboats -- which have been used to launch successful attacks on tankers in the past.","Strait of Malacca links the Indian Ocean to the South China Sea and Pacific Ocean .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. Sen. David Vitter returned from a week-long absence from Congress Tuesday, a day after he made a public apology for ""a serious sin"" as investigators probe an alleged prostitution ring that operated in the nation's capital. Vitter vanished from public view last week after his phone number turned up among those kept by a reputed ""D.C. Madam"" in records that have become part of her upcoming criminal trial. The Louisiana conservative apologized privately to his fellow Republican senators at their weekly policy lunch Tuesday, senators who attended the lunch said. One described Vitter's his apology as ""humble"" and ""short and to the point."" The senator said Vitter was met with a great deal of ""empathy"" by the senators in the room.  Watch Vitter apologize for his ""past failings"" » . Tuesday morning, Vitter did not visit his Senate office, where the media had camped out in anticipation of his return. He also was not seen at a residential address near the Supreme Court building. He eventually emerged at a scheduled Senate hearing taking place near his office building. He arrived nearly 30 minutes late for the start of the panel, which heard testimony regarding commercial airline service to outlying parts of the United States. At first, only CNN and a local camera crew had learned of his whereabouts. But as word spread among media outlets, Senate officials had to urge order among the gaggle of newspaper writers, photographers and other television crews that began making noisy entrances to record Vitter's return. The senator left the hearing early and tried to ignore shouted questions and camera lights in the hallway. He then turned and stopped. Vitter referred to comments he made Monday evening near New Orleans, Louisiana, then said, ""I look forward today to be back at work, really focused on a lot of important issues for the people of Louisiana. I'll leave it at that."" Last week, Vitter acknowledged in a statement that his number had turned up in the telephone records of accused ""D.C. Madam"" Deborah Jeane Palfrey. Vitter, 46, said those calls were made prior to his election to the Senate in 2004, and he and his wife had already dealt with what he termed a ""serious sin"" privately, through marriage counseling and confession to a Roman Catholic priest. On Monday, Vitter and his wife Wendy spoke to reporters in the New Orleans suburb of Metairie, where he lives. ""I know this has hurt the relationship of trust I've enjoyed with so many of you and that I have a lot of work to do to rebuild that trust,"" the senator said. Palfrey is facing money laundering and racketeering charges stemming from her alleged prostitution operation. She had denied the charges, saying her business was a legitimate, legal escort service. At first she tried to sell the phone records to raise money for her defense. After a judge imposed restrictions on the records, Palfrey distributed the records without charge, hoping media outlets would help track down clients who her lawyer believes may help in her defense. Vitter is the first lawmaker entangled in the case, although State Department official Randall Tobias resigned in May after confirming he patronized Palfrey's business. Larry Flynt's Hustler magazine claimed credit for exposing Vitter's connection to Palfrey, saying he came clean only after a journalist working as a paid consultant for the magazine discovered the senator's number in her phone records.

"(CNN) -- A California movement protesting $1 billion in budget cuts to the state's university system appeared to have burgeoned into a nationwide demonstration on Thursday. Students and professors in dozens of states were challenging administrators and state lawmakers over budget cuts and tuition increases that they say are reducing students' class options and increasing their expenses. Some of the demonstrations turned chaotic. In Oakland, California, police arrested 160 protesters who shut down a major freeway, according to city police spokeswoman April McFarland. The Oakland protesters had left a march from the University of California, Berkeley to Oakland City Hall and wound up on the Interstate 980/880 interchange, CNN San Francisco affiliate KGO reported. KCRA: Protesters threaten to block interstate . McFarland said the protesters brought Thursday evening rush hour traffic to a halt for an hour and 45 minutes. One man is in critical condition after he tried to elude arrest by jumping off the freeway onto a tree, KGO reported. He fell from the tree onto the street below, a roughly 22 foot drop from the interchange, according to KGO. At the University of California Davis, police held back student protesters who had threatened to shut down nearby Interstate 80, CNN affiliate KCRA in Sacramento reported. Police fired rubber bullets into the ground in an effort to deter students, who made it as far as an I-80 exit ramp just south of campus. At the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, at least 15 people were arrested in demonstrations Thursday, according to CNN affiliate WTMJ. A University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee vice chancellor allowed a protester to drop off pamphlets in the chancellor's office, then called campus police when dozens of protesters tried to enter the building, according to WTMJ. University police called the Milwaukee Police Department for backup, and officers spent an hour rounding up protesters. Students yelled ""Let her go!"" and ""What did he do?"" as Milwaukee police led students into their black and white vans. Across the country, students told of having to work second jobs and make lifestyle adjustments in the face of dramatic tuition hikes. ""I work at two jobs, go to school full time to make ends meet,"" said Tyler, a fifth-year senior at San Francisco State University, where students and faculty protested Thursday. She did not give her last name. ""I have been here a really long time. I struggle to keep [taking] classes to be able to keep my financial aid every semester, and I really don't know when I'm going to be able to get out of here. Every semester, something is cut, and I can't get the class I need. Who knows when I will be out of here,"" she said. Many of Thursday's demonstrations focused on cuts to state-funded colleges and universities, which supporters say drive up tuition, limit classes and make higher education unobtainable to many. A blog called Student Activism, which was compiling a list of the protests, said that 122 events were scheduled in 33 states -- most on campuses, and some at state capitols. Are you taking part in protests? Send photos, videos . Professors and students say dissatisfaction, anger and an uncertain future had led to call for a ""Day of Action"" to defend education. At the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, dozens of protesters gathered Thursday and chanted, ""Hey hey, ho ho, these student fees have got to go."" Video submitted from the demonstration by a CNN iReporter calling himself Bowtieguy showed students carrying handmade signs with messages like ""Where's Holub's pay cut?"" -- a reference to university chancellor Robert C. Holub. Another homemade sign read ""Chop from the top."" At California State University-Fullerton, dozens of students marched outdoors, chanting, ""Students united will never be divided."" A video submitted by a CNN iReporter who calls herself MelissaF showed handmade signs saying ""Protect humanities"" and ""What happened to our future?"" State funding for the California State University system was reduced by nearly $1 billion for the academic years between 2008 and 2010. Schools have responded by increasing fees, canceling classes, cutting student support programs and furloughing professors. Fees have increased 182 percent since 2002. Class waiting lists have doubled or tripled. ""The less affordable education becomes, the less likely low-income students will be able to get a college education,"" said Lillian Taiz, president of the California Faculty Association and professor of history at California State University Los Angeles. In addition to protests at numerous public colleges and universities in California, demonstrations also were planned for K-12 schools Thursday, according to the Student Activism blog. See where the protests are happening . On the other side of the country, in Georgia, a legislative committee proposed $300 million in cuts to the state's college system, on top of the $100 million cut in the past two years, University of Georgia President Michael F. Adams wrote in an open letter to students, faculty and staff. ""This is not our plan; these are not cuts we offered to make; and we will vigorously oppose any effort to implement them,"" Adams wrote. In response, student organizers in Georgia are urging fellow students at every college in the state system to wear black this week to ""symbolize the 'death' of our education,"" according to a post on Facebook. In Colorado, hundreds rallied at the Capitol in Denver, holding signs and cheering. Watch students march on Colorado Capitol . In New York, students at New York University, which is private, planned to meet up to protest tuition increases and education cuts with students from Hunter College and the New School, two other private institutions in Manhattan, said NYU student Claire Lewis. ""It is a private university, but like a lot of public universities, our tuition is also getting increased,"" Lewis said. ""This isn't anything new with the economic crisis with us; our tuition gets increased an average of 6 percent every year,"" she said. ""But lots of our students depend on federally funded grants and loans, and so the broader-nation education cuts definitely affect us."" She added, ""Kids literally work two or three jobs to pay for their tuition here."" In Maryland, students at the University of Maryland in College Park planned to walk out of class at noon, meet at the student union and then march to a plaza for a rally, according to a Facebook invitation.

"Berlin, Germany (CNN) -- Four men were convicted in Germany on Thursday in connection with a foiled terrorist plot against Western targets, court officials said. The men had begun mixing a huge amount of explosive material that could have resulted in a strong blast, bigger than attacks in 2005 on London's public transport network and the 2004 Madrid railway bombings, authorities said. Three of the men -- two Germans and a Turk -- were arrested in September 2007. The other was arrested later. The Germans -- Fritz Gelowicz and Daniel Schneider -- were sentenced to 12 years in prison. Turkish citizen Adem Yilmaz received 11 years. Attila Selek, a German citizen of Turkish descent, received five years. Gelowicz, Schneider and Yilmaz were convicted of, among other things, being members of a terrorist organization, court officials said. The men had joined the Islamic Jihad Union in 2006. Selek received a shorter sentence because he was convicted only of supporting the organization. Three of the men had trained at camps in northern Pakistan with the group that had ties to al Qaeda, German authorities said. The group said it wanted to target the Ramstein Air Base and other U.S. and Uzbek military and diplomatic installations in Germany, German authorities said. The group also wanted to force Germany to stop using an air base in Uzbekistan as a stopover point for moving equipment and personnel in and out of northern Afghanistan. -- CNN's Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.","Authorities say planned blast would have eclipsed London and Madrid bombings .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Chinese officials blamed poor management and inadequate precautions for an explosion at a mine that killed 104 people, state-run media said Monday. In addition to those killed, 60 miners remained hospitalized from Saturday's morning blast at the Xinxing coal mine in northeastern Heilongjiang province. Most were being treated for injuries such as carbon monoxide poisoning and burns, CCTV reported. Six were in critical condition with severe burns. Four other workers were still trapped underground in the mine shaft, the Xinhua news agency said. The accident started with a gas leak in one of the shafts, officials said. But because of poor ventilation, gas poured into the main tunnel and triggered an explosion that shook 28 of the 30 mining platforms in operation. About 530 miners were working in the mine at the time. Luo Lin, head of the State Administration of Work Safety, told Xinhua that the mine's management was to blame for not evacuating workers when they detected a high gas density in the pit. State regulations stipulate that miners have to evacuate if gas density exceeds 2 percent. The density in the pit was more than 10 percent, authorities said. ""The mine has too many mining platforms in operation and has sent to many workers down the pit to increase output,"" said Zhao Tiechui, deputy head of the work safety agency. The mine is owned and operated by the Heilongjiang Longmei Mining Holding Group. Unlike most small- and mid-size collieries, Xinxing produces 12 million tons of coal a year. The blast took place during a five-day inspection of work safety conditions in Hegang, local media said. Immediately after the blast, the mine's director, deputy director and chief engineer were fired. Mine accidents are common in China. Last year, 3,200 people were killed in such accidents, state media said. The latest blast is the deadliest since December 2007, when 105 miners were killed in Shanxi province. The deadliest mine blast took place in August 2007 when two collieries flooded in Shandong province, killing 181 miners, Xinhua said. Chinese officials said they will pay at least 250,000 yuan ($36,600) to each of the families of the miners who died.","Chinese officials blamed poor management and inadequate precautions for an explosion .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The parents of a California girl who was allegedly raped and killed by a registered sex offender are calling for tougher standards against repeat offenders. ""How many times do our daughters need to be raped before we put these monsters behind bars forever?"" said Kelly King, mother of 17-year-old Chelsea King, in an interview Thursday with CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""I just don't -- I don't get it. Change has to be made,"" she continued, ""and I know that there are people out there that are trying to, you know, get this change in place."" She said she and her husband, Brent King, ""are committed for the rest of our lives to be a part of that."" On Wednesday, John Albert Gardner III, 30, a registered sex offender, was charged in the rape and murder of Chelsea, who lived in the San Diego area. Gardner, who is being represented by a public defender, was also charged Wednesday with assault with intent to commit rape in an attack on a jogger in December 2009. He pleaded not guilty to all charges. Gardner, of Lake Elsinore, California, will not be allowed to post bail. If convicted, the charges against Gardner make him eligible for the death penalty, the San Diego County district attorney's office said Wednesday. The prosecutor's office said it has not determined whether it will seek capital punishment. For the Kings, there's no question. ""I think the death penalty is a very appropriate punishment for this case,"" Kelly King. Brent King said he had ""100 percent agreement"" with his wife. Searchers found a body on Tuesday they believe to be that of Chelsea King. Police arrested Gardner on Sunday. King had been missing since February 25. Investigators said she was last seen at her school in Poway, about 15 miles north of San Diego. Her car, with her cell phone inside, was found at Rancho Bernardo Community Park. Searchers found remains in a shallow grave at that park; they were found along the shoreline of a tributary south of a lake, authorities said. The body was found in a heavily wooded area not visible from nearby homes. A shoe had been found earlier in the same area, the sheriff said. King's parents, noting she was a great student and avid runner, said she had gone for a run at the park before she disappeared. ""It's a lovely area, very peaceful, very picturesque -- exactly what Chelsea ... loved to be in,"" Kelly King said. She said the couple's son, 13-year-old Tyler, was extremely close to his sister. ""He's struggling through it just like us,"" Brent King added. Gardner's next court appearance, a status hearing, is scheduled for Tuesday. His preliminary hearing is scheduled for March 18.","Parents of Chelsea King make appearance on CNN's ""Larry King Live""

"(CNN) -- A ferry crammed with people capsized late Friday night in Bangladesh, killing at least 28 passengers, police said. The boat had a capacity of 1,500, but was overcrowded with about 2,000 people, said Nazrul Islam, the police chief of Bangladesh's southern Bhola district. They were traveling from the capital, Dhaka, to their homes in Bhola for the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha. The boat toppled as passengers weighted down one side to disembark, Islam said. The dead included eight women and 15 children. About 50 more people were injured. Police and firefighters rushed to aid passengers, many of whom were trapped in the lower deck. The number of people missing remained unclear and rescue teams feared the death toll would rise.

"(CNN) -- A 6.4-magnitude earthquake jolted southern Taiwan on Thursday morning, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. There were no immediate reports of injuries or deaths but some damage has occurred to buildings and major bridges, and power was cut off near the epicenter. The quake struck at about 8:20 a.m. (7:20 p.m. Wednesday ET) in a mountainous region about 25 miles northwest of Taitung, on the southeast coast, and 40 miles east of Tainan and Kaohsiung on the southwest coast. The region, which includes Maolin National Scenic Area, is recovering from a direct hit by Typhoon Morakot that killed hundreds in August. The typhoon dumped more than two feet of rain, causing serious mudslides in the south, including one that buried the village of Shiao Lin under 50 feet of mud. Thursday's quake was followed by several aftershocks, the largest reaching 4.8. The initial 6.4 quake rumbled to the surface from 14 miles deep. Were you there? Did you feel it? The Taiwan Ministry of Interior and the National Fire Agency said electricity was cut off near the epicenter but had no further information. Residents in southern Taiwan reported cracks in some buildings and major bridges. Train service was also disrupted in some areas, Taiwanese media reported. Albert Yu, communications manager of the humanitarian organization World Vision, told CNN he was about halfway through a 90-minute trip via high-speed train from Taipei to Tainan when the quake struck. Passengers did not feel the quake, he said, but operators stopped the train and announced what had happened. More than an hour later, the train had not resumed its journey. ""The operator is examining the train and the tracks,"" he said, adding that there was a concern about the stability of the area, particularly after the typhoon. ""Inside the train, people are calm and are waiting it out -- opening laptops, starting to work and chatting with people around them."" Yu said World Vision ""has already been on high alert responding to the quakes in Haiti and Chile, so we're closely monitoring reports in the earthquake in southern Taiwan."" Residents in the capital Taipei, 155 miles to the north, also felt the shaking. Earthquakes are not uncommon in the 13,892-square-mile island -- about the size of the U.S. states of Maryland and Delaware combined -- which sits across the juncture of the Eurasian and Philippine tectonic plates. A 6.4-magnitude earthquake struck the same general region in December. The island took a double hit on December 26, 2006, when earthquakes of 7.1 and 6.9 magnitude hit eight minutes apart. The largest recorded quake to strike Taiwan was an 8.0-magnitude quake in 1920, but the worst earthquake disaster stemmed from a 7.1-magnitude quake in 1935 that killed more than 3,200 people -- followed by a 6.5-magnitude quake that killed more than 2,700 people three months later. More recently, a 7.6-magnitude earthquake killed more than 2,400 people in 1999.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Violent attacks on election day didn't stop large numbers of Iraqis from successfully casting their votes in key parliamentary elections Sunday. ""Yes, we were scared after we heard these bombings, but we just had to come,"" said a woman who identified herself only as Ghisoun. Her two children were at her side. ""It's an opportunity we can't miss -- not for us, but for our children,"" she said. Polls in Iraq to elect a 325-member parliament closed Sunday evening, capping an electoral process in which militants intent on disrupting the vote carried out dozens of attacks that killed 38 people. Despite the risks, voter turnout could reach 55 percent, a senior U.S. official told CNN. Another voter, Ali Abdul Hassan, also risked the uncertainty of voting Sunday with his 2-month-old infant. ""I want my baby to start voting early,"" he said. The general feeling expressed by voters on election day was a longing for change and for a government that will be able to provide basic things such as water, electricity, jobs and security. A woman in line to vote in Baghdad said her vote was a way of fighting back against acts of terrorism in Iraq. Preliminary results are expected by Wednesday, the United Nations said. Results will start emerging for each province as soon as votes are tallied from 30 percent of polling centers in that province. About 60 security incidents were reported throughout the country Sunday, the senior U.S. official said. These included fatal mortar and rocket attacks in various Baghdad neighborhoods. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said those reports of mortar attacks in Baghdad had not yet been confirmed. According to Gates, Gen. Ray Odierno, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, ""had expected a significant number of high-profile attacks, both suicide vests and truck and car bombs, but the security situation, the efforts of the Iraqi Security Forces are such that al Qaeda in Iraq was forced to change their tactics."" Speaking at the White House, President Obama also downplayed Sunday's violence. Some violence was expected, Obama said, but ""overall, the level of security, and the prevention of destabilizing attacks, speaks to the growing capability and professionalism of Iraqi security forces, which took the lead in providing protection at the polls."" The success of the vote showed that ""the future of Iraq belongs to the people of Iraq,"" Obama said. The United States does not support particular candidates in Iraq, but does support Iraqis' right to elect their representatives, he said. ""We know there will be very difficult days ahead in Iraq,"" Obama said. ""There will probably be more violence. But, like any sovereign, independent nation, Iraq must be free to chart its own course."" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised Iraq's High Electoral Commission and security forces for running and securing the vote. ""I congratulate all the people of Iraq who participated in national elections today and over the past three days,"" she said in a statement. ""There is no better rebuke to the violent extremists who seek to derail Iraq's progress."" Counting was taking place at the polling stations at the end of voting, under the gaze of observers. Ballots will be counted twice to ensure accuracy, according to the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq. The number of ballots cast will be reconciled with the number of ballots issued to each polling station, and in case of a significant discrepancy, the station will be audited, the U.N. said. Authorities in Baghdad announced a curfew on the capital from 10 p.m. Sunday until 5 a.m. Monday. In a statement Sunday, Obama said: ""I have great respect for the millions of Iraqis who refused to be deterred by acts of violence, and who exercised their right to vote today."" Referring to the day's violence, he added: ""We mourn the tragic loss of life today, and honor the courage and resilience of the Iraqi people who once again defied threats to advance their democracy."" It was Iraq's fifth nationwide vote since 2003, but only the second for a full four-year-term parliament. More than 30 mortar rounds hit the capital, with three landing inside the heavily fortified International Zone. The zone, informally known as the Green Zone, houses the U.S. Embassy and many Iraqi government buildings. One of the rockets landed in the Ur neighborhood in northeastern Baghdad, killing 12 people. The capital also experienced a number of deadly roadside bomb attacks. The last time the country had a national vote was in 2005, when the Sunni Arab population boycotted the elections and the political process. A Shiite-led government emerged and the Sunnis, feeling disenfranchised, went on to form the main part of the insurgency. The U.N. mission in Iraq calls the elections an ""important milestone in Iraq's democratic progress,"" serving to strengthen the country's sovereignty and independence as the United States draws down its military presence there. Sunday's elections were originally supposed to happen in January but were delayed because of political disagreements and a delay in passing the election law that paved the way for this vote. There are 18.9 million eligible voters, casting ballots for 325 seats in the Council of Representatives, Iraq's parliament. The seats represent Iraq's 18 provinces. The number of seats is increasing from the previous 275. Seat allocation was based on 2005 population data from the Ministry of Trade and adjusted for a 2.8 percent annual growth across all governates. On Friday, voting began for Iraqis abroad in 16 countries -- including the United States, United Kingdom, Turkey, Iran, Canada and others in the Middle East and Europe. There are no exact figures on those eligible to cast ballots abroad. Estimates on turnout have ranged anywhere from 300,000 to 3 million. About 6,200 candidates from more than 80 political entities are vying for seats. At least a quarter of the positions -- 82 -- are guaranteed to go to women, and eight more have been allocated for minorities. They include five set aside for Christians and one each for the Shabak, Sabaeans (Mandaeans), and Yazidis. A number of special measures were put in place for security reasons. Since Monday, there has been a ban on motorcycles and bicycles in Baghdad until further notice, and on Sunday a two-day ban on any vehicles in cities went into effect. Provincial borders were ordered sealed, preventing movements between provinces, from Saturday to Monday.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Pentagon is making detailed plans to send about 34,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan in anticipation of President Obama's decision on the future of the eight-year-old war, a defense official said Tuesday. Obama held a lengthy meeting with top advisers Monday night and said Tuesday that he would announce plans for Afghanistan after the Thanksgiving holiday. A Defense Department official with direct knowledge of the process said there has been no final word on the president's decision. But planners have been tasked with preparing to send 34,000 additional American troops into battle with the expectation that is the number Obama is leaning toward approving, the official said. Obama ordered more than 20,000 additional troops to Afghanistan in March. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, reportedly has called for up to 40,000 more to wage a counterinsurgency campaign against the Taliban, the Islamic militia originally ousted by the U.S. invasion in 2001. The president has weighed several options for bolstering the American contingent, ranging from sending a few thousand troops to sending the 40,000 McChrystal requested. McChrystal was among those who took part in Monday's conference with Obama and other top advisers, which broke up at 10 p.m. Vice President Joe Biden, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen and Karl Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador in Kabul, were among the other senior officials in the meeting. Obama said Tuesday that the deliberations have been ""comprehensive and extremely useful."" ""It's going to be important to recognize that in order for us to succeed there, you've got to have a comprehensive strategy that includes civilian and diplomatic efforts,"" he said at a news conference Tuesday with visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The military has planning under way to send these units: three U.S. Army brigades, totaling about 15,000 troops; a Marine brigade with about 8,000 troops; a headquarters element of about 7,000; and between 4,000 and 5,000 support troops -- a total of approximately 34,000 troops, according to a defense official with direct knowledge of Pentagon operations. CNN reported last month that this was the preferred option within the Pentagon. The troops would be dispatched throughout Afghanistan but would be focused mainly on the southern and southeastern provinces, where much of the recent fighting has taken place. Currently, brigades from Fort Drum in upstate New York and Fort Campbell in Kentucky are among those that are next in line to deploy. About 68,000 U.S. troops are in Afghanistan, along with about 45,000 from the NATO alliance. Two U.S. military officials said NATO countries would be asked to contribute more troops to fill the gap between the 34,000 the Pentagon expects Obama to send and the 40,000 McChrystal wanted. The request is expected to come during a December 7 meeting at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell would not discuss specific numbers, but he said NATO would be asked for additional help. ""Clearly, if the president decides to commit additional forces to Afghanistan, there would be an expectation that our allies would also commit additional forces,"" Morrell said. U.S.-led troops invaded Afghanistan in response to the al Qaeda terrorist network's September 11 attacks on New York and Washington. The invasion overthrew the Taliban, which had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory, but most of the top al Qaeda and Taliban leadership escaped the onslaught. Taliban fighters have since regrouped in the mountainous region along Afghanistan's border with Pakistan, battling U.S. and Afghan government forces on one side and Pakistani troops on the other. Al Qaeda's top leaders, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, remain at large and are suspected to be hiding in the same region. The conflict has claimed the lives of more than 900 Americans and nearly 600 allied troops. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Tuesday suggests that the U.S public is split over whether more troops should be sent to Afghanistan. Fifty percent of those polled said they would support such a decision, with 49 percent opposed. The poll found that 66 percent of Americans believe the war is going badly, up 11 percentage points from a similar survey in March. Overall support for the war has fallen to 45 percent, with 52 percent opposed. iReporters sound off; share your views on sending more troops in Afghanistan . Afghanistan was among the topics Obama and Singh discussed in their meetings Tuesday. Singh said the international community needs ""to sustain its engagement in Afghanistan, to help it emerge as a modern state."" ""The forces of terrorism in our region pose a grave threat to the entire civilized world and have to be defeated,"" he said. ""President Obama and I have decided to strengthen our cooperation in the area of counterterrorism."" India is one Afghanistan's biggest international donors, contributing $1.2 billion in aid. That involvement has been met with suspicion in Pakistan, India's nuclear rival in South Asia. But it has helped the United States by sharing some of the burden of stabilizing the country and providing civilian support. In addition, several leading analysts have argued that settling the decades-old tensions between India and Pakistan would allow both sides to pull troops off their borders, giving Pakistan more resources to battle the Taliban along its northwest frontier. ""I think that will certainly be at the center of the agenda this week,"" Nicholas Burns, a former State Department official, said on CNN's ""American Morning."" U.S. prospects in Afghanistan depend partly ""on convincing Pakistan to be more cooperative in the fight against those terrorist groups."" ""The United States is not going to be an outright mediator between Pakistan and India, but we can quietly, behind the scenes, push them to reduce their problems,"" Burns said. CNN's Elaine Quijano and Mike Mount contributed to this report.","NEW: NATO allies will also be asked to send more troops, officials say .

"(Wired) -- Joe Wilkins knew there was only one way to give his supercharged, alcohol-injected Hemi-engined hot rod more power: Put a jet engine in the trunk. ""It started as a hobby and turned into a monster,"" said Joe Wilkins, the motor madman behind what might be the wildest 1939 Ford ever built. He's an inventor and defense department contractor, and the idea of goosing the Ford's ability to turn heads and shred tires came when he bought a used gas turbine engine. ""I got hooked on the simplicity and power that this thing produced, and I decided one day I want to put it in a car."" Luckily for us, he did. The Hemi Jet -- Wilkins has copyrighted the name -- fires up this weekend at the Houston AutoRama, and Wilkins plans to attempt a land speed record in the near future. In the meantime, he's tooling around Navasota, Texas, in what he says is the ultimate sleeper when the jet engine's tucked away in the trunk. Most people say ""Nice car"" and assume he's got the obligatory small-block Chevrolet engine under the hood. Little do they know. ""I can drive it up to the store and get a gallon of milk if I want to,"" he told Autopia. The car is an amalgamation of the Big Three, with a Chrysler engine, Chevrolet drivetrain and Ford body. Wilkins says the jet engine was probably used as an APU and weighs 110 pounds. He claims the car is street legal so long as the jet stays stowed. He fires it up from time to time to show off, and he plans to run it flat-out at the Bonneville Salt Flats. ""We want to be the fastest street legal car in the world,"" he said. He's got some intense competition. The Bugatti Veyron tops out at 253 mph and the Shelby Supercars Ultimate Aero TT does 255. And then there's Red Vector One, that crazy Vauxhall that does zero to 60 in under a second. Record, schmecord -- we just want to see the video. ""I'm more than certain the car will go over 300,"" Wilkins said. ""We've still got a ways to go [before Bonneville], but not a long way. We'll have to experiment in some wind tunnels and end up with a spoiler on the back to keep the front end on the ground."" Sadly, Wilkins won't be behind the wheel during the car's test run. ""I turned 61 last Sunday. I just don't think I'm going to be able to handle it [without] the reflexes I had 20 or 30 years ago,"" he said. ""I know several people who would be more than interested."" So do we, and we even suggested Wilkins give the job to fellow jet-junkie Bob Maddox. After jumping from a plane with a pulse jet strapped to his chest, we suspect Maddox would welcome the opportunity to stay on the ground.

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- Investigators have found ""elements of an explosive device"" at the site of the derailment of an express train in Russia and believe an act of terror caused the deadly incident. The derailment killed at least 26 people and injured about 100, but there was no immediate word on who or what group might have been behind the action. ""One can say with certainty that that was indeed an act of terror,"" Vladimir Markin, spokesman for the investigative committee of the Russian prosecutor's office, told CNN. He would not elaborate on exactly what kind of ""elements of an explosive device"" the investigators discovered earlier, but said the crater found beneath the railroad bed was ""1.5 meter by 1 meter in size."" Later Saturday morning, a second device went off on nearby tracks going the opposite direction, Vladimir Yakunin, head of Russian Railways, told Russian TV. He said no one was injured in the smaller explosion. Markin said investigators are ""studying the site of the accident, questioning the witnesses and conducting all kinds of forensic and technical examinations."" Federal Security Service Director Alexander Bortnikov said, ""Criminology experts have come to a preliminary conclusion that there was an explosion of an improvised explosive device equivalent to seven kilos of TNT. ""Several leads are being pursued now. A criminal case has been opened under Article 205 (""terrorism"") and Article 22 (""illegal possession or storage of weapons or explosives"") of the Russian Criminal Code."" Russian Interior Minister Rashid Nurgaliyev said on TV that there are possible suspects in this crime. ""There are several people who could be involved in this crime,"" he said. One of them, he said, is a ""stocky-built man of about 40 years old, with red hair."" ""There are some traces left at the crime scene which could help in the investigation,"" he said. ""We are getting a lot of information now, and I am very thankful for people who have responded to our requests to render their assistance in investigating this crime."" A total of 681 people -- 20 of them employees -- were on the Nevsky Express as it traveled from Moscow to St. Petersburg on Friday night. The Nevsky Express is Russia's fastest train, equivalent to a bullet train. The crash happened at 9:25 p.m. (1825 GMT) when the train was 280 kilometers (174 miles) from St. Petersburg, Russian state radio said. At least three carriages carrying more than 130 people derailed and turned on their sides, and emergency workers were working to free anyone who may still be trapped inside. Yakunin told Russian TV that the company will pay a compensation of 500,000 rubles ($17,240) to the victims' families and 200,000 rubles ($6,897) to those injured. The crash happened 44 minutes after another high-speed train, the Sapsan, had successfully traveled from Moscow to St. Petersburg on the same rails, a representative of the Russian Transport Police said during a video conference call Saturday. In August 2007, an explosion on the tracks derailed the Nevsky Express, injuring 60 people in what authorities called a terrorist act. About 27,000 passengers on 60 trains were facing delays Saturday as a result of the accident, Russian State TV reported.

"Beijing, China (CNN)  -- President Obama intends to meet the Dalai Lama even though China has warned that such a meeting would harm bilateral ties, a White House spokesman said Tuesday. ""The president told China's leaders during his trip last year that he would meet with the Dalai Lama, and he intends to do so,"" Bill Burton told reporters covering Obama's planned town hall meeting in New Hampshire later Tuesday. No date for Obama's meeting with the Tibetan spiritual leader has been announced. The Dalai Lama has speaking engagements scheduled in the United States in late February and in May. Earlier Tuesday, China warned that ties between two of the world's superpowers would be strained if Obama met with the Dalai Lama. ""It will seriously undermine the foundation of Sino-U.S. political relations,"" said Zhu Weiqun, a Communist Party official who is in charge of talks with representatives of the Dalai Lama. ""We will take corresponding action to make relevant countries see their mistakes."" Zhu issued his warning during a news conference to discuss the lack of progress made during five days of talks between China and the Dalai Lama's representatives. Beijing accuses the Dalai Lama of advocating for Tibetan independence from China. ""The two sides had sharply divided views,"" Zhu said. ""We have been accustomed to such clash of viewpoints. It's been the norm rather than the exception."" In explaining Obama's intention to hold the meeting, Burton said the Dalai Lama ""is an internationally respected religious and cultural leader, and the president will meet with him in that capacity. ""As the president has expressed, we expect that our relationship with China is mature enough where we can work out issues of mutual concerns -- such as climate, the global economy and nonproliferation -- and discuss frankly and candidly those issues where we disagree,"" Burton said. ""The president is committed to building a positive, comprehensive and cooperative relationship with China."" Tibet is technically autonomous from the central Chinese government, but the Dalai Lama and others have said they favor genuine autonomy and resent the slow erosion of their culture amid an influx of Han Chinese, the most numerous ethnic group in China. Zhu said there would be no compromise on China's control of Tibet. Representatives from the two sides have met eight other times, but have reached no consensus on the issue of autonomy. The Dalai Lama fled China in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule. He lives in exile in the north Indian hill town of Dharamsala. Burton said the United States ""considers Tibet to be a part of China, and we have human rights concerns about the treatment of Tibetans."" ""We urge the government of China to protect the unique cultural and religious traditions of Tibet,"" he said. CNN's Jaime Florcruz and Helena Hong contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama to meet Dalai Lama in his capacity as a ""respected religious and cultural leader""

"London, England (CNN) -- For the past decade, Dubai has been home to the greatest concentration of cranes anywhere in the world as billions of tonnes of concrete, steel and glass have refashioned the city skyline. But the rapid growth of the past six years has slowed recently due to the global slump in property prices. Hopes of a recovery have now been further imperiled by the news that the state-owned Dubai World has requested to delay paying its massive debts by six months. Dubai has become a playground for architects as well as millionaires commissioning a string of audacious building projects aimed at helping reposition the city as the financial and cultural hub of the Middle East. Billions of dollars have been spent transforming the landscape, erecting buildings which continue to break records of all dimensions. The Burj Dubai -- at 818 meter the world's tallest skyscraper, the vast Palm Jumeirah -- built on land reclaimed from the sea, the Dubai Mall -- the largest shopping center in the world and the Mall of the Emirates; home to the world's biggest indoor ski slope form part of a very long list of completed construction projects. ""The whole place is kind of like a time-lapse film. You wake up in the morning and it's just a little bit different,"" Jim Krane, author of ""City of Gold: Dubai and the Dream of Capitalism"" told CNN. But, according to Krane, some of these projects, like the Burj Dubai, suffer from a severe lack of practicality. ""Dubai doesn't really need to have to build tall asides from prestige purposes. If you look at it, it's a really bad idea. It uses as much electricity as an entire city. And every time the toilet is flushed they've got to pump water half a mile into the sky,"" he said . The telescopic shape is also presents problems of a more practical nature Krane thinks. ""The upper 30 or 40 floors are so tiny that they're useless, so they can't use them for anything else apart from storage. They've built a small, not so useful storage warehouse half a mile in the sky,"" he said. This prestige over practicality issue something of a recurring theme in Dubai's banner building projects. Krane, who lived and worked in Dubai from 2005 to 2007, also called into questions the attraction of the Palm Islands. The $12 billion Palm Jumeirah -- populated with valuable villas and hotels -- could have been a lot better he says. ""It's not been very well done. You can't even see the sea and all the fronds which house the communities are gated."" Its sister islands the Palm Deira -- which developers say will be the size of Manhattan Island housing 1.5 million residents -- has yet to be completed. Krane hopes it never is. ""It's on the Sharjah border [one of the six other emirates] and is the most densely populated part of the city. There's no infrastructure at all over there for and extra 1.5 million residents"" And despite the best efforts of the property companies the Palm Islands have still harmed the area's marine environment. The environmental damage isn't limited to the coastline according to Krane. The huge boulders helping lay the foundations for coastal reclamation projects like Waterfront project -- which developers boast will be twice the size of Hong Kong Island -- are, he says, slowly laying waste to some of the UAE's more picturesque mountain regions. But with the renewed financial uncertainty Dubai's ambitions are likely to be reigned in. In 2008, it was announced that the new Palazzo Versace hotel in Dubai would have a beach which featured refrigerated sand. At the moment the only people getting cold feet are the people looking to invest in Dubai. And while that situation continues, many of Dubai's construction projects will remain on ice.","Dubai's construction boom has slowed in recent months due to economic slowdown .

"Mecca, Saudi Arabia (CNN)  -- The Hajj, an obligatory pilgrimage for Muslims, began this year on Wednesday with two twists: thinner crowds and heavy rain. A rare rainstorm inundated pilgrims in the city of Mina, flooding tents and making conditions miserable for the 2.5 million pilgrims performing the ancient rituals, according to Isha Sesay, CNN's correspondent there. The tents, where pilgrims plan to spend the night in prayer and contemplation, were leaking and flooding, giving rise to fears of disease, Sesay reported. She said, however, that the several hours of rain was not likely to stop any of the pilgrims from performing the rituals. ""They've saved for years to get here,"" Sesay reported. ""This is a blessing. They're not going to let rain get in the way."" iReporter witnesses heavy rain near his home . She said no incidents had been reported among the dimished number of pilgrims. Officials said the swine flu could be keeping pilgrims from the fifth pillar of Islam, which requires devotees to journey to the holy city of Mecca at least once in their lifetime. Saudi's Hajj Ministry said Wednesday that 40 percent fewer Saudi pilgrims are participating in the ancient rituals this year, largely due to fears of disease, though a greater number of international visitors had come. ""Concerns about the spread of H1N1 may have affected the turnout but we are confident of all measures in place to increase monitoring of cases and awareness about how one can protect himself or herself,"" said Dr. Abdullah Al-Rabbeeah, the Saudi health minister. A teenager and three elderly people have died of the H1N1 flu virus at the Hajj. The victims were a 17-year-old Nigerian female and a Sudanese man, an Indian man and a Moroccan woman who each were 75 years old. Many of the 2 million pilgrims have been arriving days and weeks ahead of the Hajj, which coincides with flu season. The rituals of the five-day event began Wednesday. But with fewer visitors, businesses are feeling the pinch this year. Shopkeeper Fahmi al-Rashidi said he has slashed prices of the gold he sells in Mecca's Al-Ghaza market. ""Business is lower than last year,"" he said. ""I think swine flu fears combined with high gold prices are turning people away from spending."" Another merchant, Fahd al-Qraishi, said a normal 20 percent profit has dropped to 5 percent. Hajj observed in Second Life . The Hajj Ministry reported, however, a 17 percent increase in the number of international pilgrims, some of whom are enjoying discounted rates at hotels including the Hilton Makkah. Then there was the real damper. Mecca resident Khaled Nemary said he had not seen so much rain in a quarter-century. And the forecast? Showers through Friday. CNN's Amir Ahmed and Daniela Deane contributed to this report.","Huge downpours flood tents in Mina .
Ministry says there are 40 percent fewer Saudi pilgrims this year .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Caring for a car has you a befuddled. The honeymoon's over, and bureaucratic tasks are beating out bliss. You're meeting with a prospective babysitter or housekeeper, a stranger you'll entrust with much of your life. Rory Tahari, with son Jeremey, hopes to make life's to-do's more manageable with a new book and iPhone app. How do you know what to do? Where should you go and when? What should you ask these people? You need a list! If figuring out the answers to these kinds of questions leaves you loopy, Rory Tahari has a new book that may have your name on it. ""Lists for Life: The Essential Guide to Getting Organized and Tackling Tough To-Dos"" is just what it says it is: a compilation of lists to help readers navigate everything they might need for weddings and funerals, household maintenance and vacations, divorces and diaper bags.  Watch Tahari discuss the book » . Along the same lines, she's behind a new iPhone application -- a travel packing list, available through the iTunes store -- that she said has been downloaded in about a dozen countries. ""It's just how my brain is wired. It's part of my DNA,"" said Tahari, vice chairwoman and creative director of Elie Tahari, the fashion design house bearing her husband's name. ""I don't know how to operate other than to make a list."" CNN sat down with Tahari to discuss when her list-making started, what she's passed on to her children (son Jeremey, 8, weighs in) and how being stuck in a snowstorm inspired her. Here are excerpts from that interview. CNN: You've earned the nickname ""The List Mistress,"" but when did this, dare I say, obsession start? Tahari: From a very young age, I was a compulsive list-maker. I was always organizing something or doing some kind of list. The first list I really remember making was taking an inventory of every piece of clothing in my closet and seeing how many different outfits I could make. I think I came up with 112 combinations. CNN: The book covers such a wide range of topics: weddings, the home, pregnancy, travel, medical, emergencies, divorce and more. How many of these lists are or were based on your own organizational needs? Tahari: Ninety percent of the book came from actual experiences I've lived through myself. The other 10 percent, I basically did the research. [She has a degree in journalism and is a former TV producer.] . I fell off a horse two years ago, and I broke my back. I'd never been hospitalized before, so I never knew what it was like to be hospitalized. If you have a friend or family member who's in the hospital, bring them a blanket. They're always going to be cold, and the blankets they give you in the hospital don't cut it. And the nurses? You need them; they don't need you. A little batch of cookies or brownies goes a long way with the nurses. And you know what? You'll have a lot better hospital stay. CNN: Some of these to-do lists seem more fitting and standard than others. How did you decide what would go in the book? Tahari: People say, ""Why the emergency chapter? If you're in the middle of an emergency, you're not going to grab the book."" Obviously, you're not going to have the book with you in the middle of the emergency. ... But I lived through at least three tornados in Atlanta [Georgia], one terrorist attack in New York and one blackout in New York. And after the blackout, I realized my family doesn't have a  plan. I wanted to at least stimulate the idea of having a plan. CNN: Can you give me an example of a topic you had to research? Tahari: Cars. I had to have help with cars. Although, in fourth or fifth grade, there was some crazy snowstorm in Atlanta [where she grew up]. I was stuck in carpool on the way home from school with eight people for eight hours. I had one Tootsie Roll in my backpack, and let me tell you, a Tootsie Roll between eight people did not go far. So I decided in the car section that I wanted to have an emergency road list, a check list of things to have in the car. I was stuck in the car for eight hours, starving to death. CNN: You've used list making to help friends figure out practical things they need to do, but do the lists you've made over the years ever venture into the emotional or psychological -- say, for example, pro-con lists for staying in a relationship? Tahari: This book is not an advice guide. It's a to-do list. There's not a lot of prose in the book. I just want to be told what to do. I don't really want to hear advice. I don't need to hear the story. Just tell me what to do. CNN: So, Jeremey, how organized are you? Jeremey: In school, I don't have such an organized desk because I'm always busy and don't have time to clean up. But I do make some kinds of lists. I sort of have a list in my head. I memorize it. CNN: How about when you go on a trip, Jeremey? Are you a good packer or unpacker? Jeremey: I would write down stuff on paper and then stick it on the drawers in the hotel [so he knows where everything is]. My dad, when he's packing, he just takes all the clothes and goes like this [imitating his dad's voice], ""Jeremey, help me throw in the clothes."" I try to fold them up and put them in. I'm like, ""Dad, you're not supposed to do that."" Tahari: I definitely think he is taking after me.","Figuring out to-do lists of life made easier with new book and iPhone app .

The man had been bitten several times and was bleeding profusely. CNN affiliate WPBF identified him as Stephen Howard Schafer of Stuart. Local coverage from CNN affiliate WPBF . The man was in cardiac arrest by the time the lifeguard helped him ashore. He was pronounced dead at an area hospital. Shark attacks have been on the decline, according to the International Shark Attack File, which is part of the Florida Museum of Natural History. In 2008, there were 59 attacks worldwide, fewer than the 71 attacks 2007. That continues an annual decline since the all-time high of 79 in 2000. Forty-one of the 59 attacks worldwide occurred in the United States, with Florida leading with 32.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: I'm Carl Azuz, and you're tuned in to CNN Student News. Let's go! First Up: State of the Union . AZUZ: ""He shall from time to time give to Congress information on the state of the union."" The words of the U.S. Constitution and the reason why President Obama delivered his State of the Union address to Congress last night. A little background for you here: This speech hasn't always been called the ""State of the Union."" It used to be called the ""annual message."" But the purpose has always been the same: for the president to talk about some of the biggest issues facing the country. That is why President Obama spent a good part of last night's speech talking about the economy and the challenges facing the country. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: One year ago, I took office amid two wars, an economy rocked by a severe recession, a financial system on the verge of collapse, and a government deeply in debt. Experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act, we might face a second depression. So we acted, immediately and aggressively. And one year later, the worst of the storm has passed. But the devastation remains. One in ten Americans still cannot find work. Republican Response . AZUZ: After the State of the Union, it's traditional for the other party to offer its response to the president. Last night, the Republican response was given by newly-elected Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell. He won that election last year. McDonnell made his speech from the Virginia state House. He talked about some of the political issues that both parties agree on. But he also focused on some of the areas, especially when it comes to the economy, where Republicans and Democrats don't see eye to eye. GOV. BOB MCDONNELL, (R) VIRGINIA: In the past year, more three million people have lost their jobs, yet the Democratic Congress continues deficit spending, adding to the bureaucracy, and increasing the national debt on our children and grandchildren. The amount of this debt is on pace to double in five years and triple in ten. The federal debt is already over $100,000 per household. This is simply unsustainable. The President's partial freeze announced tonight on discretionary spending is a laudable step, but a small one. Web Promo . AZUZ: For more details on the State of the Union and the reaction to it, plus a quiz about the history of this annual address, head to the Spotlight section on our home page, CNNStudentNews.com . Running on Hope . AZUZ: All right, so the economy -- you know it -- a big theme of last night's speech. It's also a big concern for residents of Wilmington, Ohio. 15,000 people live there. And when the largest employer left town, about 10,000 of those people lost their jobs. Wilmington is hoping that money from the government's stimulus bill will turn things around. Mary Snow examines how much it could help. (BEGIN VIDEO) MARY SNOW, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: DHL stopped operations here last year, bringing shipping to a halt. Nearby businesses started to topple and continue to fall. In all, 10,000 people in this area lost their jobs. The head of the county's homeless shelter tells us she's seen the effects, and she's having a hard time meeting the demand for shelter and food. Denise Stryker-Grant is getting stimulus money through a grant, but it's not much; $200,000 spread out over 3 years that will help keep people in their homes. But she says jobs, the only thing that would really help, remain elusive. DENISE STRYKER-GRANT, CLINTON COUNTY HOMELESS SHELTER: The frustration of continuing to refer them to places only to be told, you know, ""We've got 500 resumes before you've even walked in the door,"" and the frustration of them not having any opportunities. SNOW: To create opportunities, Wilmington's mayor David Raizk applied for more than $61 million worth of stimulus projects. Of that, roughly $5 million has been awarded so far to a project to create jobs. It's focused on Wilmington's downtown and is set to start this spring. So, how do you see this benefiting from stimulus money? DAVID RAIZK, WILMINGTON MAYOR: With the stimulus project, we'll be able to improve our curbs and gutters and sidewalks . SNOW: The hope, he says, is that improvements will attract businesses. In the immediate future, the project is estimated to create about 100 jobs. RAIZK: They're going to be construction jobs, but it's something, it's something. We want jobs here of any type right now. SNOW: To get thousands of others back to work, the mayor has set his sights on Wilmington's airpark and is hoping to redevelop it. Eight million dollars in stimulus money, he says, is being used to retrain workers, and he's optimistic Washington will come through with more aid if the airpark comes back to life. RAIZK: I have tried to maintain a close relationship with our state partners and with our federal partners to say, ""Look, we need help and what can you do?"" And they have responded, but that doesn't mean they've responded as much as I would like or anybody would like. SNOW: Mary Snow, CNN, Wilmington, Ohio. (END VIDEO) Blog Promo .

AZUZ: When you're driving and you take your foot off the gas, you expect your car to slow down. That isn't happening in some Toyotas, which is why the company is recalling over two million vehicles. This includes some of Toyota's best selling models. The problem is that, over time, the gas pedals can get stuck. The company hasn't figured out a solution yet. In the meantime, it says it will not make or sell any of the affected vehicles until the problem can be fixed. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Kerns' U.S. history classes at Blach Intermediate School in Los Altos, California! Machu Picchu was part of what ancient civilization? If you think you know it, shout it out! Was it: A) Inca, B) Aztec, C) Maya or D) Olmec? You've got three seconds -- GO! Machu Picchu was part of the Inca Empire. It's located in what is now Peru. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Machu Picchu . AZUZ: The Incas built Machu Picchu in the 1400s. Tens of thousands of people visit the site every year. Right now, hundreds of them are trapped. The reason? This! Floods and mudslides triggered by days of heavy rain. You can see some of it in this video sent in by iReporters.

AZUZ: In Israel, there's an exhibit about the Holocaust; that name refers to the time during World War II when Nazis killed millions of people, including six million Jews. Many of them lost their lives in concentration camps like the one at Auschwitz. It was liberated 65 years ago this week, and now, the design plans for that infamous location are on display in Israel. As Paula Hancocks explains, they're being used as a reminder and a warning. (BEGIN VIDEO) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT, JERUSALEM: Blueprints of death that shocked and shamed the world.

MOSHE HAELION, AUSCHWITZ SURVIVOR: We do believe if one says we will kill the Jews; we have to believe this. HANCOCKS: Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu showed these plans in his address to the United Nations last year, calling on the world to stop Iran in its nuclear ambitions and President Ahmedinejad in his Holocaust denial. Visiting the prints now on display in Jerusalem, the Prime Minister is repeating the warning. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: There is evil in the world. If it is unstopped, it expands. It is expanding, and it is threatening the same people, the Jewish people. HANCOCKS: These blueprints were found in an abandoned Berlin flat just two years ago. They were bought by the German newspaper Der Bild and then handed over to Israel so they could be put on display here, at Jerusalem's Holocaust museum. Israel's prime minister says it is vital to put ""pure unadulterated evil"" on show for all to see, so it can never be allowed to happen again.

"Washington (CNN) -- While administrations come and go, and power in Congress teeters between political parties, one thing remains constant in the lives of Washington, D.C.'s, elite: the power lunch. Between noon and 2 p.m., brokers meet to clinch deals, with the emphasis more on power than on lunch. Just steps from Capitol Hill, Charlie Palmer is one of the places to see and be seen at lunchtime. Depending on the week, the modern American steakhouse serves between 70 and 80 congressmen and between 20 and 30 senators. ""I'd bet we've had every member of Congress and every senator in the restaurant at some point,"" says Matt Hill, executive chef for the famed eatery. It's not just the proximity to Capitol Hill that draws Washington's elite to Charlie Palmer. The restaurant has several private dining areas -- including a rooftop with scenic views of the city -- and an executive chef who prides himself on serving homemade, inventive fare. ""We do anything, we've got senators from Hawaii that come in, and they ask for Hawaiian hors d'oeurves, we've got, you know, people from Texas that ask for things from Texas,"" Hill says. ""So, we can really vary the menu, and it makes it interesting for me to try to come up with new ideas."" Thirty-seven years ago, Tommy Jacomo moved to Washington with his brother and built The Palm with his bare hands. Now, as executive director of the famed power spot, Jacomo is known by Washington's elite as the keeper of the keys to The Palm. Everyone knows him. ""It's pretty frightening, yeah, you can't even walk down the street sometimes, Jacomo said. ""People say, 'Hey, Tommy! Put me down for two at 12:30,' and I don't even know who the hell they are."" The Palm has hosted every president from Richard Nixon to Bill Clinton. President Obama has yet to make a visit. But it's not just presidents who visit The Palm. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel has frequented the restaurant since the Clinton administration. Cabinet secretaries including Madeleine Albright, administration officials, senators and representatives, Supreme Court justices, the city's top lobbyists, lawyers, strategists and media elites are all regulars at the Dupont Circle steakhouse. And if you become a regular, you get your picture on the wall. ""People used to think when we first opened up that we had all the [portraits of] Republicans on one side and all the [portraits of] Democrats on the other side,"" Jacomo said. ""It's not really as much thought behind it. It just goes up, it's good customers, loyal customers, famous people, infamous people, and I decide where I want to put them when I get the chance,"" he joked, pointing out the minimal space left on the wall. Not everyone is willing to put their picture on the wall. James Carville and Mary Matalin, who are political strategists and CNN contributors, chose to have their dogs' portraits on the wall instead of their own. While steakhouses remain a favorite, not all power restaurants dish out filet mignon. Steps from the White House are three of Washington's oldest power spots: The Oval Room, which serves up American fare; Bombay Club, which is Indian; and Old Ebbitt Grille, which also specializes in American cuisine. Cafe Milano, in Georgetown, and The Monocle and Johnny's Half Shell, on Capitol Hill, also remain abuzz with some of the most prominent people in Washington. Italian restaurant Posto on 14th Street has become a favorite among younger administration staffers because of its laid-back atmosphere and expansive dining room. Posto's sister restaurant Tosca, owned by Paolo Sacco, has kept D.C.'s top lobbyists and politicians coming back since it opened in 2001. Not only known for the power scene and homemade Italian cuisine, Tosca has set itself apart from others by having some of the most attentive waitstaff in the city. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, known by friends as a big foodie, has dined at Tosca, as have Emanuel and Obama adviser David Axelrod. The Washington Post reported that former Sen. Tom Daschle convinced then-freshman Sen. Obama to run for president at the Italian eatery.

"New York (CNN) -- Matthew Hoh, a young man previously unknown to the general public, has become the first U.S. official known to resign in protest over the Afghan war. He was the senior U.S. civilian adviser in Zabul province, Afghanistan. There certainly have been more famous resignations over a president's war policy. President Lyndon Johnson's first secretary of health, education and welfare and the architect of much of the civil rights and Great Society programs, John Gardner, resigned because he could not support the war in Vietnam and privately told the president he could not support him for re-election. LBJ's Deputy Secretary of Defense Cyrus Vance resigned after becoming convinced the war in Vietnam, which he had strongly supported initially, was unwinnable. After his resignation he unsuccessfully urged Johnson not to bomb North Vietnam. Vance later resigned as President Carter's secretary of state after arguing again unsuccessfully against ""Operation Eagle Claw,"" the disastrous desert rescue attempt of our 52 hostages in Iran that cost the lives of eight American soldiers. Our history is filled with brave men and women who have resigned because they could not support a policy or an administration, but it's never easy to quit and far more people carry on quietly and do what they perceive as their duty. Many thought former Secretary of State Colin Powell should have resigned rather than testify before the U.N. on Iraq's supposed weapons of mass destruction, information he may have thought was suspect. There might not have been an Iraq war if he had done that. But the resignation of Hoh, a former Marine captain and Iraq veteran from the Foreign Service, as reported Tuesday on the front page of the Washington Post may have more impact than the others. His comments reflect the feelings of many of his countrymen who have far less knowledge of the Afghan situation then he does. The White House and State Department made every effort to keep Hoh from leaving and valued his service. He was exactly the kind of person we needed there if our Afghan efforts are to be successful. Even though I support the continued efforts in Afghanistan and believe the president should give Gen. Stanley McChrystal what he needs, Hoh's words reflect thoughts that I, too, have pondered. Hoh said in his resignation letter: ""I have lost understanding of and confidence in the strategic purposes of the United States' presence in Afghanistan. I have doubts and reservations about our current strategy and planned future strategy, but my resignation is based not upon how we are pursuing this war, but why and to what end."" But before the president acts (and he will make his decision quickly, I hope) he needs to answer Hoh's: ""Why and to what end?"" If he can't, he will have great difficulty convincing his party and the nation of the need for further action. The why part is easier to answer. The United States and our NATO allies went into Afghanistan after the ruling Taliban government refused to turn over Osama bin Laden and to stop al Qaeda from operating with its protection. The United States has been in full pursuit of bin Laden since the August 7, 1998, truck bombings of the U.S. embassies in Tanzania and in Kenya in which hundreds were killed. These attacks were preceded by the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center and the Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia that killed 19 U.S. servicemen. After that came the attack on the USS Cole in Yemen, which preceded the September 11, 2001, attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Thousands of our fellow citizens were murdered and our way of life was altered forever. In spite of being on the FBI's Most Wanted list, bin Laden has been an elusive target. In the late '90s on several occasions he was in our sights, but the inability or hesitancy to pull the trigger allowed him to escape. He is still out there with tens of thousands of supporters who want to destroy Americans and Westerners. The threat is still real. The bad guys are still out there and may be here. I feel this is the most important decision this president will make -- and other world leaders will judge him on his decision. Is he a viable partner? Can he make the tough decisions U.S. presidents need to make? Many Americans have doubts as they almost always do with any activity of our troops beyond our borders. We as a nation are still badly scarred from the divisions in the country caused four decades ago by the Vietnam War. Our president never served in the military, and it might be important to review the thinking of some who have and some who went before him. Caspar Weinberger was a young infantry captain in World War II who went on to be one of the most important secretaries of defense and who rebuilt our broken military after Vietnam. Facing a demoralized military officer corps and troops who weren't in much better shape, Weinberger asked all the major leaders in the Pentagon who had been young officers in Vietnam what lessons they learned. Included was a former young major in Vietnam who was now a brigadier general and served as Weinberger's military assistant, Colin Powell. Weinberger came up with the Weinberger doctrine: . 1. The United States should not commit forces to combat unless the vital national interests of the United States or its allies are involved. 2. U.S. troops should only be committed wholeheartedly and with the clear intention of winning. Otherwise, troops should not be committed. 3. U.S. combat troops should be committed only with clearly defined political and military objectives and with the capacity to accomplish those objectives. 4. The relationship between the objectives and the size and composition of the forces committed should be continually reassessed and adjusted if necessary. 5. U.S. troops should not be committed to battle without a ""reasonable assurance"" of the support of U.S. public opinion and Congress. 6. The commitment of U.S. troops should be considered only as a last resort. A version of this became the Powell doctrine. Every president should have a copy of Weinberger's doctrine on his desk. Number 2 and 5 are still the unanswered questions. They are the biggest obstacles to whatever decision President Obama makes. That, along with Hoh's question: ""To what end?"" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ed Rollins.","Ed Rollins: Matthew Hoh quit the Foreign Service due to doubt about war .

"(CNN) -- ""Family Ties"" actress Meredith Baxter made the media rounds Wednesday confirming the rumors that she is a lesbian. ""It was a later in life recognition,"" the actress explained to Matt Lauer on the ""Today"" show Wednesday. The National Enquirer recently ran a story about Baxter being spotted on a lesbian cruise through the Caribbean with a ""female friend,"" which was then picked up by celebrity blogs. As a result, the 62-year-old decided to tell her fans herself. ""I didn't want some tabloid to take the story and make it up,"" Baxter said in the interview. ""I wanted it to be in my own words.""

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan's military said Tuesday that its forces have taken over a Taliban stronghold during the ongoing ground offensive in the tribal region of South Waziristan. Pakistani security forces have secured Sararogha and have started to clear the town of weapons and ammunition, the military said. It comes a day after its forces gained control of Kaniguram, another key Taliban stronghold, which the military says its forces have now completely secured. According to the military, 21 militants and one Pakistani soldier died in the past 24 hours of fighting -- most of them in the raid on Sararogha. The military is trying to rout Taliban insurgents operating along the Pakistan-Afghan border. The restive and largely ungoverned region of South Waziristan is the headquarters of the Pakistani Taliban. Pakistan's military suspects its leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, is still in the region backed by up to 8,000 militant fighters. Pakistan's army has launched three similar offensives in Kaniguram and Sararogha since 2004 without success, sometimes agreeing to peace deals that eventually fall apart. Army spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas recently told CNN that this time a peace deal is not an option. ""Certainly there is no scope of a peace deal,"" Abbas told CNN. ""It is a fight to the finish."" The military began its ground offensive in South Waziristan three weeks ago, however the region has been affected by a broader anti-Taliban offensive that has uprooted more than 180,000 people this year, according to the United Nations. Many of those people -- more than 94,000 -- have fled South Waziristan since June, the U.N. said last week. In recent weeks, Pakistan has been relentlessly rocked by a wave of attacks as Islamic militants retaliate against the military campaign. On Monday, the Pakistani cities of Lahore and Rawalpindi were hit by separate suicide bombings. A suicide attacker believed to be on a motorcycle targeted people outside a bank in Rawalpindi who were lined up to pick up their monthly checks, police said. That attack killed 30 people, police said on Tuesday. The attack happened in the Cannt area of Rawalpindi, close to Pakistan's military headquarters where the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, was meeting with Pakistan's army chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani on Monday. It was unclear if he was there at the time of the attack. Hours later, two suicide bombers detonated their explosives at a police checkpoint in Lahore, injuring 17 police and civilians. CNN's Samson Desta and Reza Sayah contributed to this report.","Pakistani forces secure Sararogha, clearing the town of weapons and ammunition .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Senate on Monday opened what is expected to be a lengthy and rancorous debate on a sweeping bill to overhaul the nation's health care system. In statements laced with heated and conflicting rhetoric, Senate Democrats and Republicans outlined opposing positions on the 2,074-page Democratic measure that would provide health insurance to an additional 31 million people at a cost of almost $850 billion. Democrats led by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada framed the debate as historic and said the bill would provide vital health insurance for almost all Americans, hold down spiraling costs that threaten the U.S. economy and instill needed reforms to ensure the long-term solvency of the government-run Medicare health program for senior citizens. ""In the greatest country on Earth, no American should die simply because they don't have health insurance,"" said Sen. Max Baucus of Montana, one of the bill's architects, while Reid said the bill ""saves money, saves lives and saves Medicare."" Republicans countered that the bill was too big, too expensive and would cause more harm than good. Sen. John McCain of Arizona called it a ""sham"" and a ""2,074-page monstrosity full of measures that would impair the abilities, particularly of our senior citizens, to keep the benefits they've been promised."" McCain immediately proposed sending the bill back to committee to remove all provisions intended to bring down the costs of Medicare. He cited proposed cuts to Medicare, including $118 billion in subsidies provided to private insurers for Medicare Advantage -- an enhanced benefits program for senior citizens. ""There is no math, old or new, that gets you to no change in the benefits they have under Medicare Advantage and yet cuts $120 billion,"" McCain said. A vote on McCain's proposal was likely on Tuesday. The House has passed its version of a health care bill, and if the Senate passes its bill, the two measures would be merged by a congressional conference committee. Both chambers then would have to approve the revised bill before it could go to President Obama's desk. On Monday, debate quickly bogged down in Republican procedural objections, causing Reid to lament: ""This is not a good way to start this debate."" Republican Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming challenged a motion by Reid that he said would unfairly cut off the proposal of amendments, including McCain's planned Republican amendment to prevent cuts to Medicare. While Reid's motion failed, Enzi labeled it a stunt. So far, Republicans unanimously oppose the health care bill. The Senate voted 60-39 to launch debate on the measure, overcoming a Republican filibuster through support from every member of the Democratic caucus. Reid also will need 60 votes to eventually close the debate, and his ability to secure that support remains uncertain. The debate will feature amendments intended to delete or change controversial provisions, including creation of a government-run public health insurance option to compete against private insurers, tax increases and provisions intended to prevent federal tax dollars from paying for abortion except in cases of rape, incest or danger to the mother's life. For the most part, battle lines are clearly drawn. Liberal-minded senators such as Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who sits with the Democratic caucus, favor a public option as the best way to force competition on private insurers to bring down costs, while fiscally conservative Democrats such as Nebraska's Ben Nelson are concerned about the cost and scope of a government-run alternative. Nelson has said he would join a Republican filibuster against closing debate on the bill if it retains the current public option provision, which allows states to opt out of a national plan. Another Democratic caucus member, independent Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, says he also will prevent a final vote if the bill contains any form of public option. On the Republican side, none of the 40 senators supports a public option, but one -- moderate Olympia Snowe of Maine -- has discussed a trigger mechanism that would automatically bring a public option if thresholds for expanded coverage and lower costs go unmet. The trigger idea is considered the lone chance of a compromise that could gain the support of any Republicans. For Democrats, each vote is crucial. Overcoming a filibuster requires support every member of the Democratic caucus, so if Lieberman or others oppose a public option, Reid would need a GOP senator to switch sides on the bill. Senate Democrats concede that some changes are necessary to get the health care bill passed. They contend their comprehensive approach is necessary to reform a system in which higher costs are draining the national economy and harming businesses and individuals. Republicans call for an incremental approach that they say would reduce the costs of health care without needing to create bureaucracies and raise taxes in a huge overhaul. Other risky issues for Senate Democrats include abortion and tax increases to pay for health care reform. The bill includes tax increases aimed at those earning more than $200,000 a year and insurers providing so-called ""Cadillac"" health plans worth more than $8,500 a year for individuals or $23,000 for families. It also would set a 5 percent tax on elective cosmetic surgery. In contrast, a separate health care bill narrowly passed by the House of Representatives earlier this month includes an income tax surcharge on individuals earning more than $500,000 a year and couples making more than $1 million. Republicans say any tax increase is bad in a struggling economy because it hinders growth and gets passed on to consumers, while Democrats argue the bill's tax provisions wouldn't hit the lower or middle class and would create incentive for private insurers to lower the cost of policies. However, a key Democratic constituency -- organized labor -- opposes taxing the ""Cadillac"" health plans negotiated for workers in lieu of wage increases. On abortion, the House bill has more restrictive language regarding the use of federal funding, and some Senate Democrats say they oppose adding it to their chamber's proposal. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the Senate health care bill would reduce the federal deficit by about $130 billion over the next 10 years, through 2019. Any effect on the deficit in the following decade would be ""subject to substantial uncertainty,"" but probably would result in ""small reductions in federal budget deficits,"" the budget office report said. It also reported that health insurance premiums would remain roughly the same for most people, with costs for lower-income Americans reduced due to subsidies under the plan. According to the budget office, more than 80 percent of Americans would remain in employer-based health plans. Both the Senate and House bills would require individuals to buy health insurance, with penalties for noncompliance. Unlike the House version, the Senate bill does not mandate that all employers offer health care. The two bills are virtually identical on a broad range of changes, including creating health insurance exchanges, expanding Medicaid, subsidizing insurance for low- and some middle-income families, and capping out-of-pocket medical expenses, while preventing insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Friday it has approved a new vaccine to prevent seasonal influenza. Agriflu, made by Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, is not intended to protect against the H1N1 virus, commonly known as swine flu. The vaccine was approved using an accelerated approval process, the FDA said. Novartis demonstrated that the vaccine induces levels of antibodies in the blood that are effective in preventing seasonal influenza, but it still needs to conduct further studies. Agriflu, for ages 18 and older, is administered as a single injection in the upper arm and is available in single-dose, prefilled syringes, according to the FDA. Novartis produces another licensed vaccine for seasonal influenza, Fluvirin, approved for ages 4 and older. Although no vaccine is 100 percent effective in preventing disease, vaccination is the key to flu prevention, according to the FDA. Novartis spokesman Eric Althoff said Agriflu is made in Siena, Italy, with eggs, and it has been available in Europe under the brand name Aggripal. This approval, he said, will add to future seasonal vaccine supplies.","Agriflu, made by Novartis, is not intended to protect against the H1N1 virus .

"Editor's note: Madeleine K. Albright is former U.S. secretary of state. William S. Cohen is former U.S. secretary of defense. They are co-chairs of the Genocide Prevention Task Force. Madeleine K. Albright served as secretary of state under President Bill Clinton. (CNN) -- In this age of electronic media communications, Americans are increasingly confronted in their living rooms -- and even on their cell phones -- with information about and images of genocide and mass atrocities virtually anywhere they occur. This instantaneous media communication has sensitized many Americans to the suffering of people in all corners of the globe. The Internet has proved to be a powerful tool for organizing broad-based responses to genocide and mass atrocities, as we have seen in response to the crisis in Darfur. With all of this information written and broadcast about the horrors of genocide and mass atrocities around the world, why do they continue? And as public citizens, public officials and policymakers, how can we prevent this horrendous crime that assaults our humanitarian values and threatens our national security? Last year, we agreed to co-chair the Genocide Prevention Task Force, which was jointly convened by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, The American Academy of Diplomacy and the United States Institute of Peace. (The final report is to be released next week.) The idea for the task force arose out of a desire by each of these institutions to reach beyond their individual capabilities and build a practical framework that could help the U.S. government better respond to threats of genocide and mass atrocities. Our challenge was to match words to deeds and stop allowing the unacceptable. That task is in fact one of the most persistent puzzles of our times. Many people ask: Why do genocides and mass atrocities happen? There is no consensus as to the causes of genocide and mass atrocities, nor is there one commonly agreed-upon theory that explains the key catalysts, motivations or mechanisms that lead to them. History has shown that genocide and mass atrocities manifest themselves in highly variable ways, and we should not assume that future perpetrators will follow old patterns. However, there are warning signs. Genocide is not the inevitable result of ""ancient hatreds"" or irrational leaders. It requires planning and is carried out systematically. But that fact also means that there are ways to recognize its signs and symptoms, and viable options to prevent it at every turn, if we are committed and prepared. Our report recommends a number of distinct but interrelated areas where the United States government can develop and deploy more effective strategies to identify and pursue opportunities for prevention of genocide and mass atrocities: . First, we believe that leadership is an indispensable ingredient. Nothing is more central to preventing genocide than leadership -- from the president, Congress and the American people. Making progress requires leaders to summon political will not only after a crisis strikes, but also before one emerges. Second is the importance of early warning. It is critical for policymakers to have good analysis of areas where there is a high risk of genocide or organized violence in order to design effective strategies and spur action. By improving the accuracy of warnings, we will find greater opportunities for preventive action. Early prevention can avert a crisis. Many countries are vulnerable to extreme violence. By engaging leaders, institutions and civil society at an early stage, the United States can help countries steer clear of these dangers. Preventive diplomacy is critical to halt and reverse escalation. Even when signs of preparation for genocide are apparent, there are opportunities to alter leaders' decisions and interrupt their plans. By improving our crisis response system, we will be better prepared to mount coherent, carefully calibrated and timely preventive diplomatic strategies. A willingness to utilize military options to stop ongoing atrocities when prevention efforts have failed is crucial. U.S. military assets can also play an important role in supporting and providing credibility to options short of the use of force, including by deterring violence through military presence or threat. Lastly, we cite the power of international action. The United States has an interest in promoting a system of international norms and institutions that averts potential genocide and mass atrocities before they occur, stops them quickly and effectively when they occur, helps societies rebuild in their wake and holds perpetrators accountable. By working in partnership with others in the global community, the United States will multiply its positive impact. We do not underestimate the challenge. We understand that the next president will face many pressing international priorities, as well as real limitations of time and resources. But we believe that preventing genocide is possible, and that striving to do so is imperative, both for our national interests and for our leadership position in the world. Our report seeks to honor the memory of past victims of genocide and mass atrocities by encouraging future action. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Madeleine K. Albright and William S. Cohen. Other members of the Genocide Prevention Task Force include John Danforth, Thomas Daschle, Stuart Eizenstat, Michael Gerson, Dan Glickman, Jack Kemp, Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, Thomas R. Pickering, Vin Weber, Anthony Zinni and Julia Taft (1942-2008).

"(OPRAH.com) -- What's it like to be a 30-something woman in America today? From religious choices to parental pressures, a successful single woman in Washington, D.C. and a devoted mother of four open up. American-born Muslim Mubaraka tries to be open with people so she can help them understand her religion. One issue that plagues an average of 6.3 million women in America is being single. Julie, a Chicago pediatrician, struggles with the stigma of being alone in her 30s. ""I've tried JDate, a Jewish Internet dating service, Match.com, setups by my friends,"" Julie says. ""I recently adopted a dog, hoping to meet someone out in the dog park."" Like many single women in America, Julie is no stranger to the dating scene -- but finding dates isn't always the problem. ""It's not that there are no men to date. It's that I'm not meeting anyone that I'm attracted to. Nobody that I think is quality and worthy of me and what I have to offer and what I want to do."" Now Julie thinks marriage may not even be what she wants. Instead of waiting around for a husband, she's considering having a child on her own. ""I'm probably going to investigate an anonymous donor and do it artificially ... I want it to be my own biological child,"" she says. DeChane, a successful attorney in Washington, D.C., also struggles with the 30-something singles scene. Her fear is that men are intimidated by her. ""None of my female friends have ever said I'm intimidating,"" she says. ""Having an education, a house, a job does not make me intimidating. It just makes me an adult living an adult life."" She finds it ironic that her achievements may turn men off. ""I would think they would find it more unusual if I walked into the picture not having anything. But I think after 35 years of living, working and being driven, I should have something to show for it."" DeChane also thinks men make assumptions about single women in their 30s. ""I think they assume that if you aren't married, you want to get married,"" she says. ""Instead of meeting you and approaching you in a manner that's very basic -- 'I want to get to know you, who you are, what your likes and dislikes are' -- I think they walk in the door expecting you to try to strong-arm them into getting married, and it scares them away."" For Amy, a divorced mom, dating in her 30s has been stressful. ""I wish there was a manual for dating, because I have been out of the game for so long,"" she says. ""Growing up, I always wanted to be a wife and a mom and didn't expect that I would find myself single again."" With four children at home, Amy faces a unique set of dating issues. ""I run a criminal background check on every guy I go out with,"" she says. ""I have to be very careful about who I invite into our lives."" Amy also realizes that a woman with kids isn't what every guy is looking for. ""I don't consider children baggage. I think they're the bonus piece to the set, but there are a lot of men who don't see it that way,"" she says. For many women in their 30s, the pressure to get married can be intense. Julie says she isn't feeling that pressure as much anymore. ""My original goal was to meet a man, have a family just like I grew up in,"" she says. ""But it just doesn't seem to be going that way."" As a single mom, Amy says the pressure comes from people who feel like something must be missing in her life. ""People see me as a single mom [as if] that's something wrong. 'Oh, you poor thing. You'll find somebody.' People will do that kind of thing because they don't feel like it's acceptable, or that you can't do it on your own,"" she says. DeChane takes a more relaxed approach. ""I am prepared to go with the flow as far as children and marriage are concerned,"" she says. ""I was raised in a family where a number of people, even married relatives, have chosen not to have children. So it's never been the expectation that you have to get married, that you have to have children. It's really more being who you are and having a happy life. That's the focus for me."" Oprah:com: Top places to meet men over 35! For devout Muslim Mubarakah, a 30-year-old mother of four, life in her 30s is about family and career. Married for 14 years, Mubarakah never had to worry about the dating scene. ""Dating in Islam is forbidden,"" she says. ""When you meet someone and you're talking to them, the purpose is for marriage. So you're getting to know someone to know whether or not that's somebody you want to be married to."" In her career as a certified personal trainer, Mubarakah's biggest challenge is finding workout clothes in keeping with her faith. ""As Muslim women, we can only show our face and hands,"" she explains. ""Most workout outfits are either short sleeved or too tight."" She modifies her clothes by adding length to sleeves and hems, taking care to look cute at the same time. ""I try to at least look like I'm matching and I have some kind of style,"" she says. ""So generally my headscarf will match my outfit."" Mubarakah says she encounters many myths about her religion, including her heritage. ""People automatically think I'm from another country, but my mother's family is Cherokee, and my father's African-American, so I'm as American as it gets,"" she says. An open attitude helps Mubarakah deal with misconceptions. ""If people don't understand, I just try to be very personable with it,"" she says. ""I'm very open as far as questions."" Commitment to her religion requires Mubarakah to pray five times daily, whether she's working with a client, at the movies or in her living room. Still, she says that American Muslims are just like any other Americans. ""We're no longer immigrants or converts to Islam, but rather American-born Muslims that lead regular American lives. [We] incorporate our Islam beliefs and practices into our every day,"" Mubarakah says. ""In the end, all our goals are the same.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama on Tuesday proposed making ""pay-as-you-go"" rules for federal spending into law. President Obama proposed Tuesday that the government adopt ""pay-as-you-go"" rules for federal spending. The so-called PAYGO proposal requires Congress to balance any increased spending by equal savings elsewhere, Obama said in announcing the measure that now goes to Congress. A previous PAYGO mandate helped erase federal budget deficits in the 1990s, and subsequent ineffective rules contributed to the current budget deficits, Obama said. Now the PAYGO rules should be the law, he said. ""Paying for what you spend is basic common sense,"" Obama said. ""Perhaps that's why, here in Washington, it's been so elusive."" Republican leaders said the proposal comes after record spending initiatives by the Obama administration, such as the $787 billion economic stimulus program. ""It seems a tad disingenuous for the president and Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi to talk about PAYGO rules after ramming trillions in spending through Congress proposing policies that create more debt in the first six months of this year than in the previous 220 years combined,"" said Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House Minority Whip. However, a group of fiscally conservative Democratic representatives known as the Blue Dogs called Obama's proposal responsible and necessary. ""President Obama inherited an economy in free-fall and a $10.6 trillion national debt,"" said Rep. Jim Cooper of Tennessee, vice-chairman of the Blue Dog Budget and Financial Services Task Force. ""While short-term spending was necessary to get the economy moving again, our long-term fiscal problems became that much more urgent."" A White House statement said Obama's proposal calls for the Office of Management and Budget to maintain a ledger of the average 10-year budgetary effects of all legislation affecting mandatory spending or baseline tax levels. Any extra cost that lacks payment authorized by Congress would require the president to find money within the budget to pay it, while any tax cut would require a corresponding increase in tax revenue. Some costs would be exempt, including Medicare payments to doctors, the estate and gift tax, and tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2002, the White House statement said.","PAYGO proposal calls for balancing increased spending with equal savings .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- The number of dead in devastating floods triggered by torrential rains in India has risen to at least 271, and about a million people have fled their homes, officials said Monday. An aerial view of a flood-affected area in Bijapur district in North Karnataka, India. At least 192 people have died in the southern state of Karnataka, its disaster-management secretary H.V. Parshwanath told CNN. More than 450,000 people there have been housed in 1,330 relief camps as authorities completed rescue operations in most of the flooded zones in the state, he said. ""The focus is now mainly on relief,"" Parshwanath said, adding that rains have now eased in Karnataka. In neighboring Andhra Pradesh, authorities put the death toll at 51. Some 531,000 people have been evacuated to safety, with more half of them now sheltering in relief camps, said Dinesh Kumar, the commissioner of the state's disaster-monitoring department. India has deployed the military to help with relief and rescue in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. More than a dozen teams of naval divers have been sent to the two flood-hit states, the country's defense ministry said. Air force planes and helicopters have also been dropping food packets in the submerged regions. The military has been able to rescue 1,336 people so far, it added. Flood waters were now receding in two of the five worst hit districts of Andhra Pradesh, disaster official Kumar said. But floodwaters from a local river might submerge the remaining three, he warned. Flooding also killed at least 25 people in Maharashtra state, officials said. Three others died because of lightning strikes, said S.C. Mohanty, director of Maharashtra's disaster-management department. About 3,000 people have been displaced because of flooding, he told CNN. Thousands of people die each year in India during seasonal monsoon rains. More than 1,100 had been killed in monsoon-triggered flooding in different parts of the country as of last month, according to the disaster-management division of the federal home ministry.","Death toll from floods in India has now reached 271 .

"(WIRED) -- Hackers who commandeer your computer are bad enough. Now scientists worry that someday, they'll try to take over your brain. Scientists can use brain signals to control computers -- hands free. In the past year, researchers have developed technology that makes it possible to use thoughts to operate a computer, maneuver a wheelchair or even use Twitter -- all without lifting a finger. But as neural devices become more complicated, and go wireless, some scientists say the risks of ""brain hacking"" should be taken seriously. ""Neural devices are innovating at an extremely rapid rate and hold tremendous promise for the future,"" said computer security expert Tadayoshi Kohno of the University of Washington. ""But if we don't start paying attention to security, we're worried that we might find ourselves in five or 10 years saying we've made a big mistake."" Hackers tap into personal computers all the time. But what would happen if they focused their nefarious energy on neural devices, such as the deep-brain stimulators used to treat Parkinson's and depression, or electrode systems for controlling prosthetic limbs? According to Kohno and his colleagues, who published their concerns July 1 in Neurosurgical Focus, most devices carry few security risks. But as neural engineering becomes more complex and more widespread, the potential for security breaches will mushroom. ""It's very hard to design complex systems that don't have bugs,"" Kohno said. ""As these medical devices start to become more and more complicated, it gets easier and easier for people to overlook a bug that could become a very serious risk. It might border on science fiction today, but so did going to the moon 50 years ago."" Some might question why anyone would want to hack into someone else's brain, but the researchers say there's a precedent for using computers to cause neurological harm. In November 2007 and March 2008, malicious programmers vandalized epilepsy support Web sites by putting up flashing animations, which caused seizures in some photo-sensitive patients. ""It happened on two separate occasions,"" said computer science graduate student Tamara Denning, a co-author on the paper. ""It's evidence that people will be malicious and try to compromise peoples' health using computers, especially if neural devices become more widespread."" In some cases, patients might even want to hack into their own neural device. Unlike devices to control prosthetic limbs, which still use wires, many deep brain stimulators already rely on wireless signals. Hacking into these devices could enable patients to ""self-prescribe"" elevated moods or pain relief by increasing the activity of the brain's reward centers. Despite the risks, Kohno said, most new devices aren't created with security in mind. Neural engineers carefully consider the safety and reliability of new equipment, and neuroethicists focus on whether a new device fits ethical guidelines. But until now, few groups have considered how neural devices might be hijacked to perform unintended actions. This is the first time an academic paper has addressed the topic of ""neurosecurity,"" a term the group coined to describe their field. ""The security and privacy issues somehow seem to slip by,"" Kohno said. ""I would not be surprised if most people working in this space have never thought about security."" Kevin Otto, a bioengineer who studies brain-machine interfaces at Purdue Universty, said he was initially skeptical of the research. ""When I first picked up the paper, I don't know if I agreed that it was an issue. But the paper gives a very compelling argument that this is important, and that this is the time to have neural engineers collaborate with security developers."" It's never too early to start thinking about security issues, said neural engineer Justin Williams of the University of Wisconsin, who was not involved in the research. But he stressed that the kinds of devices available today are not susceptible to attack, and that fear of future risks shouldn't impede progress in the field. ""These kinds of security issues have to proceed in lockstep with the technology,"" Williams said. History provides plenty of examples of why it's important to think about security before it becomes a problem, Kohno said. Perhaps the best example is the Internet, which was originally conceived as a research project and didn't take security into account. ""Because the Internet was not originally designed with security in mind,"" the researchers wrote, ""it is incredibly challenging -- if not impossible -- to retrofit the existing Internet infrastructure to meet all of today's security goals."" Kohno and his colleagues hope to avoid such problems in the neural device world, by getting the community to discuss potential security problems before they become a reality. ""The first thing is to ask ourselves is, 'Could there be a security and privacy problem?'"" Kohno said. ""Asking 'Is there a problem?' gets you 90 percent there, and that's the most important thing."" Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Dr. David Ores, or Dr. Dave as he's referred to by his patients, isn't your average neighborhood doctor. It's not because his arms are covered with tattoos of nearly naked women or because he drives a Harley to work, but because eight months ago he started New York City's first health care cooperative for restaurant workers. The Harley-riding Dr. David Ores has started New York's first health care cooperative for restaurant workers. The Restaurant Worker's Health Care Cooperative, currently servicing 15 restaurants in lower Manhattan, provides free health care to all restaurant employees, from bus boys to bartenders. Every month the owner or manager of each restaurant contributes money into a common fund based on its number of employees. In return, their workers can go see Dr. Dave with any kind of health issue they may have. Dr. Dave, a graduate of Columbia Medical School, has been treating uninsured people for more than a decade. He decided to start the co-op after noticing a trend among patients working in the restaurant industry. ""Over the past ten years, I've seen many patients that work in restaurants, and there were always two things in common: They had no real access to any kind of medical care, and they also waited a long time to come see a doctor,"" Ores says. ""I decided to form this co-op in order to get them early, basic health care.""  Watch the doctor at work » . The restaurant workers, many of whom have never been medically insured, can now make appointments, stop by the office, text medical questions and even send photos of their injuries to Dr. Dave, free of charge. ""This is my first checkup ever,"" Asaf, a waiter at Macao Trading Co., told CNN in the waiting room. ""It's an example of how someone finds an easy and fair solution to a serious problem or a need."" And statistics show there is, in fact, a need. According to a 2005 study by the Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York, about 73 percent of all New York restaurant workers -- about 160,000 people -- have no health insurance. The co-op comes as a relief to restaurant owners who would ideally like to provide medical insurance to their employees but cannot afford to do so. ""Obviously we want to take care of our people, but financially we're only capable of doing so much,"" says restaurant owner Billy Gilroy. ""This was the perfect opportunity to be able to extend the ability to find medical services through the restaurant, but in a way that's affordable."" The price for use of the co-op's services ranges from as little as $50 a month for an establishment with a couple of employees to $400 a month for a larger restaurant. Dr. Dave, who works as a general practitioner and sees other patients, is able to support himself because both his office and apartment are located in rent-stabilized buildings operated by the Lower East Side People's Mutual Housing Association, a not-for-profit housing group that charges him only $800 a month for rent. With health care currently a hot-button political issue, Dr. Dave sees this local, not-for-profit health system as a model for how national health care in America could work. ""I'm not against profit,"" he says. ""I just don't think you can have a for-profit health system that provides everyone with proper health care. It's just never going to work."" In the meantime, Dr. Dave has plans to expand. ""In the next year I'd like for our little health co-op to offer more services. Maybe dental, more hours in the evening, maybe hire a second doctor."" He also hopes to offer routine checkups for all workers, so he can catch illnesses early and hopefully prevent steeper medical costs down the road. Although Dr. Dave started the program only eight months ago, he's no stranger to helping others. ""I would call him a pioneer in health care, I would call him a pioneer as a human being, and also as a doctor,"" says restaurant owner and longtime friend Julio Peña, who has been benefiting from Dr. Dave's services for quite a while. ""We've been trading pasta and cappuccinos for stitching somebody up with him for years, and now that he's doing it with other people, it's great.""","Health care cooperative helps New York restaurant workers .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- An independent research group predicts that cyberwarfare will accompany future military conflicts and is recommending international action to blunt its impact. Computers can become victims in future military conflicts, a nonprofit group says. The nonprofit U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit studied the cybertactics used against the country of Georgia during its military conflict with Russia last year. Cyberattacks in August 2008 shut down the Web sites of crucial Georgian government agencies, the media and banks. ""The Russians have developed a model here that is very effective,"" said Scott Borg, director of US-CCU. ""We can expect to see the Russians use it in the future, and other countries as well."" Because of the sensitive nature of much of the information, the full 100-page report is being released only to U.S. government officials and selected cybersecurity professionals. CNN was provided a nine-page summary. The study concludes that the cyberattacks against Georgian targets were carried out by civilians, many of them recruited via social networking forums devoted to dating, hobbies and politics. ""There was a large-scale collaboration on these forums,"" said US-CCU's chief technical officer, John Bumgarner. ""They were used to recruit potential actors to launch attacks, to collaborate on what types of attacks worked and what types of attacks didn't work. They were used to collaborate on how to bypass security controls and share attack codes."" As a result, Borg said, Russian sympathizers who were not hackers, and who didn't even know much about computers, could participate. The report says the civilian cyberattackers were aided and supported by Russian organized crime. Although they found no evidence of direct involvement by the Russian government or military, the report concludes that the organizers were tipped off about the timing of Russian military operations. ""There was a lot of information being passed on, but at what level it was being passed on was hard to say,"" Borg said. The report says that ""the necessary reconnaissance and the writing of attack scripts had to have been done in advance ... and suggests that cyber attacks against Georgia had been on the Russian agenda for some time."" The hackers did not carry out physically destructive cyberattacks, although they probably had the technical expertise to do so, suggesting that ""someone on the Russian side was exercising considerable restraint,"" the report says. It also notes that media and communications facilities, which might have been attacked by missiles and bombs in a conventional war, were spared that, ""presumably because they were being effectively shut down by cyberattacks."" Because the cybercampaign against Georgia presents a pattern that can be expected in future conflicts, the report says, there is an ""urgent need"" for an international organization to provide risk advisories when preparations for a cybercampaign are detected. It also says there should be an international cyber-response force to provide quick assistance to member countries, advising them on how to thwart an attack and setting up operations to do so. The report also recommends that every country conduct cyber-response exercises, otherwise ""the relevant officials will waste precious time trying to figure out whom they should be contacting and what they should be doing."" Bumgarner said that cyberwarfare ""is a global chess game in which citizens, governments and corporations are the pawns."" Borg added, ""Right now, the international community has no idea how to deal with this.""","Study looked at cybertactics used during Russia-Georgia conflict .

"ST. BERNARD PARISH, Louisiana (CNN)  -- This year, the anniversary of Hurricane Katrina will hold new meaning for Tina Caserta and her family. Liz McCartney runs the St. Bernard Project, which helps families rebuild in a parish hit by Hurricane Katrina. Like countless other residents from St. Bernard Parish, a community just east of New Orleans, Caserta lost everything in the storm. She had lived there since she was 12, married and raised her three sons there and even lived on the same street as her husband's family. ""We had nothing to salvage ... nothing,"" said Caserta, 41. She returned to her community just two months after Katrina, but she and her family have been enduring the challenges of moving from one form of FEMA housing to another ever since. When the family home she had been fighting to return to was condemned and torn down earlier this year, it was the final straw for Caserta. ""I was spiraling down,"" she said, choking up. ""I was totally hopeless."" That's when she found Liz McCartney and her nonprofit St. Bernard Project. In the past three years, McCartney and her team have helped more than 230 families rebuild and move back into their homes. At the fourth anniversary of Katrina, Caserta and her family finally see a light at the end of the tunnel. ""The day that St. Bernard Project called and told me they [would] be able to help my family rebuild, that was the first day I felt like I could breathe,"" recalled Caserta. ""They gave my family hope."" McCartney, 37, was honored last November as the CNN Hero of the Year for her efforts in St. Bernard Parish. She said the CNN Heroes award has had an incredible impact on the effectiveness of her St. Bernard Project, which she co-founded with Zack Rosenberg. More than 5,000 new volunteers have joined their cause, bringing their total to date to 15,000; and the group has raised more than $300,000 from new funding sources. ""We're rebuilding homes more efficiently than ever before,"" McCartney said. But her ultimate goal remains the same: ""We want to work ourselves out of a job."" Read more about CNN Hero Liz McCartney and her efforts in St. Bernard Parish . For McCartney, that means helping to address the housing needs of thousands of families still living in Federal Emergency Management Agency trailers or temporary housing. The St. Bernard Project recently expanded to rebuild homes in New Orleans and opened a center for wellness and mental health, offering residents one-on-one and group counseling, among other clinical services. A combination of the heartbreaking stories of continued suffering and the speed at which her group can get those families back to normal, said McCartney, ""re-energizes me and everyone on our staff about working harder and working smarter to get the job done."" To that end, this anniversary will be ""business as usual"" for the group, she said. Beginning Friday, it will hold a 24-hour build. McCartney predicts at least 120 volunteers from all over the country will each work an eight-hour shift to help build four homes. ""We get out there and show how much work can get done in a 24-hour period, which is pretty significant,"" McCartney said. Watch how McCartney's organization helped one St. Bernard resident move home . Caserta and her 17-year-old son signed up to volunteer with the graveyard shift because ""it will give us a chance to help another family out and give them the hope that I feel."" The organization also plans to launch a yearlong campaign called ""4 NOLA,"" which will include a number of fundraisers and events throughout the country. ""It focuses on the positive, promotes the progress we've made, but shows that we still have a ways to go,"" McCartney said. ""We've seen thousands of people who are ready, willing and able to respond to the needs of their fellow Americans. It's our job to continue reminding them that the need here is great."" Watch McCartney describe her turning point while volunteering in New Orleans . Today, McCartney is optimistic. And thanks to her organization's efforts to bring the community back, Caserta and many other St. Bernard Parish families are optimistic, too. ""This is going to be the first time that I can actually go through the anniversary with tears of joy, not tears of sorrow,"" Caserta said. ""Every day I see the progress [of] these volunteers, it makes me able to accept that date and the reality of what it's done to my family. Without people like Liz, people like me wouldn't have that opportunity to come home.""","Hurricane Katrina destroyed Tina Caserta's home four years ago .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Suzanne Richard was born to be an actress. Suzanne Richard says that navigating the maze of government aid regulations is a challenge. She was also, however, born with osteogenesis imperfecta, a bone-crippling disorder that can mean a lifetime of health problems and physical disability. But rather than letting her condition hinder her acting ambitions, Richard has embraced it, and now works to encourage other actors with disabilities to do the same. As the artistic director of Open Circle Theatre, a theater founded to ""showcase professional artists with disabilities in an integrated setting,"" Richard offers her actors respite from the challenges they face, and access to an industry that can often discriminate against people like her. ""I decided a long time ago that if people were going to stare at me, they were going to pay me for it,"" she quipped backstage at a rehearsal for her latest production, ""Is there ANYBODY OUT THERE?"" And at a height of just under 4 feet, with legs encased in metal braces, the 38-year-old Richard said she indeed often attracts curious stares from the public. Richard's condition, also known as Brittle Bones Disease, is a genetic disorder ""characterized by fragile bones that break easily,"" according to the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation. The condition is considered rare, thought to affect only about 40,000 Americans, said Tracy Hart, CEO of the OI Foundation. There is no cure, Hart said. While the severity of the disorder varies greatly, common health issues related to OI are a short stature, weak tissues, fragile skin, muscle weakness, loose joints, hearing loss, breathing problems and curvature of the spine, according to the OI Foundation. In Richard's case, OI has meant frequent bone fractures, painful surgeries, leg braces, wheelchairs, and a multitude of symptoms caused by the pressure her weak frame puts on her body. As a child, Richard had to have rods surgically placed in her legs ""as infrastructure"" -- a painful routine that she repeated as often as she grew. But for Richard, the physical constraints of her condition are only half the battle. When Richard was forced to retire from her job as an accessibility specialist at the National Endowment for the Arts because she was too sick to work, she lost her work-provided private health insurance coverage. She now gets Medicare through her Social Security Income retirement benefits. Social Security Income is a government program that ""makes monthly payments to people who have low income and few resources,"" and are either at least 65 years of age or disabled. Social Security recipients are subject to income restrictions depending on what state they live in, and are only allowed to have resources worth $2,000, with certain exceptions, according to the Social Security Web site (www.socialsecurity.gov). These strict financial eligibility limitations, Richard said, can be nerve-wracking, and can make navigating the system extremely difficult. ""If you lose your Social Security benefits because you make too much money, you lose everything. You lose your Medicare, too,"" Richard said. ""So if you're on disability you have to be really careful not to make too much money, which is self-defeating."" It is ""self-defeating"" especially when one considers the massive medical bills Richard accumulates due to her OI. Though Medicare covers 80 percent of her medical costs, Richard said she often comes up short some months. ""You can't get blood from a stone. ... I'm on a fixed income. That's why I'm on Medicare,"" she said. So, Richard constantly finds herself in the precarious situation of having to rely on her loved ones and the government for her financial stability. ""I'm hanging on by my fingernails. ...You can never get ahead,"" she said. It's a frustrating circumstance familiar to Richard's fellow actors at Open Circle, as well as to the millions of disabled Americans in need of expensive medical treatment. It's a system, said Richard, that must be reformed. ""It's a foreign concept to me. ... this idea that 'No, I'm sorry you don't have enough money to get this treatment,' "" she said. ""I sincerely believe that people with disabilities, if you want them to be at all a useful part of the society, you need to have medical care that you don't have to worry about having."" But until then, Richard said she survives by familiarizing herself with the system and learning to navigate through the obstacles, a skill that she was forced to learn early on. ""You just get used to adapting. I guess we always do that anyway,"" she said.","Theater's artistic director was born with bone-crippling disorder .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Anthony and Lisa Leoni have little time to worry about whether California's budget crisis will affect their daughter's life-sustaining care. Anthony and Lisa Leoni are afraid of budget cuts that pose a threat to daughter Jessica's care. A steady stream of nurses, caregivers and therapists visit 12-year-old Jessica at home around the clock. Jessica suffers from a rare and fatal disease called Niemann Pick Type C. A cholesterol imbalance destroys healthy cells in the liver, spleen and brain. Although Jessica led a relatively normal life before the illness worsened, her mother always knew the disease would eventually take over. ""Jessica was playful, happy and loves people. My heart was always a flutter because you never knew how many moments you'd get,"" Lisa Leoni says. In Jessica's case, a grand mal seizure suffered Memorial Day weekend 2005 brought a world of hurt to the Leonis. At the height of her symptoms, Jessica suffered up to 60 seizures a day. The disease, also known as NPC, has stolen her ability to walk, talk, eat or even breathe on her own. An oxygen machine pumps air into her lungs around the clock. Anthony Leoni knew they needed help. ""If you told us 10 years ago this is how your life is going to be, I would have said we're not capable. We don't have the training, ability, we don't have the energy, we don't have the stamina."" They found Bill Feeman of Westside Regional Center. ""When you walk into this home and you see Jessica, [you] just fall in love with her,"" Feeman says. ""She is a sweet soul -- you see her, she's physically helpless, yet there's a light that shines out of her eyes, it takes you in. ""When you meet this family and you see how hard-working and involved they are, you just wanna do everything you can to help.""  Watch the family's heartbreaking struggle » . Feeman worked to find in-home support in the form of nurse caregivers, therapists and medical supplies. ""This family also has all the normal responsibilities of raising a family. They have to pay their mortgage, they have to feed their family, they have to go to work. So when you have someone as medically involved as Jessica is, and you're talking about all that worriment and responsibility of your child being ill and on top of that you still have to ... bring home a paycheck every week in order to pay your bills, you need a lot of help. ""You have to be awake at night with Jessica. She cannot be left alone for even five minutes where someone is not awake and attentive to her needs. So you're looking at a family, who when I first met them a year ago had some help in the home but nowhere near enough and they were exhausted. They were trying to be caregivers, nurses, doctors, and then get up and go to work during the day and still support their family."" ""We pieced all these programs together. We finally got everything in place where they can be parents again, which is a wonderful thing. And that's what scares me about these budget cuts ... it scares me a little bit that things might start moving backwards."" One of those caregivers is Carmen Bailey, a certified nurse assistant and home health aide with Caring Connection. She has been working with Jessica for more than two years. ""It's been an experience. I call her my angel. I bathe her, groom her, position her, massage her to make her comfortable."" Carmen may be affected by the budget cuts. ""I also have to live to keep on going. I know I will still be here and whatever I need to do extra I'm willing to do it for the family and Jessica."" Westside Regional Center is one of 21 state regional centers providing services literally from birth to death. They work with people diagnosed as developmentally disabled, including those with cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism and mental retardation. Mike Danneker is executive director of Westside Regional Center. ""Our budget is in the 4 billion dollar range for about 240,000 clients in California,"" Danneker says. ""Westside gets about 140 million dollars a year and we have about 7200 clients."" He believes the California budget fix will cut a half-billion dollars statewide from their budget. ""It's going to affect everybody. Camps, therapies like art, horseback riding, some of the things people have done for decades will be gone. We'll have to cut back the number of hours to about 300 hours a year. We estimate 40 percent of California clients have over 300 hours a year."" Anthony Leoni has this to say about impending cuts to Jessica's life-sustaining care. ""It's absolutely frightening to think about what happens if the services go away. They're absolutely essential to keep Jessica going."" Jessica's childhood friend Kristina Carmickle stands by her bedside. ""We did a lot of tap (dance) together, that was Jessie's favorite. Once you have a friendship that's big enough, you're always wishing for the best."" Anthony Leoni sums it up this way: ""We know that there are other families that have challenges similar to us, sometimes even more dramatic than ours, and if we can serve a purpose or a role to help bring the awareness to public what it takes to take care of a family like ours, then we're willing to make that effort.""","Twelve-year-old Jessica Leoni has rare and fatal disease .

"Editor's note: This is an excerpt from ""Zeitoun"" by Dave Eggers, a nonfiction account of a Syrian-American immigrant and his extraordinary experience during Hurricane Katrina. Eggers is the author of five other books, including ""What Is the What,"" a finalist for the 2006 National Book Critics Circle Award. Eggers is the founder and editor of McSweeney's, an independent publishing house based in San Francisco. Dave Eggers writes that Abdulrahman Zeitoun dreamed of fishing on the Syrian coast as Katrina approached. (CNN) -- FRIDAY, AUGUST 26, 2005 . On moonless nights the men and boys of Jableh, a dusty fishing town on the coast of Syria, would gather their lanterns and set out in their quietest boats. Five or six small craft, two or three fishermen in each. A mile out, they would arrange the boats in a circle on the black sea, drop their nets, and, holding their lanterns over the water, they would approximate the moon. The fish, sardines, would begin gathering soon after, a slow mass of silver rising from below. The fish were attracted to plankton, and the plankton were attracted to the light. They would begin to circle, a chain linked loosely, and over the next hour their numbers would grow. The black gaps between silver links would close until the fishermen could see, below, a solid mass of silver spinning. Abdulrahman Zeitoun was only thirteen when he began fishing for sardines this way, a method called lampara, borrowed from the Italians. He had waited years to join the men and teenagers on the night boats, and he'd spent those years asking questions. Why only on moonless nights? Because, his brother Ahmad said, on moon-filled nights the plankton would be visible everywhere, spread out all over the sea, and the sardines could see and eat the glowing organisms with ease. But without a moon the men could make their own, and could bring the sardines to the surface in stunning concentrations. You have to see it, Ahmad told his little brother. You've never seen anything like this. And when Abdulrahman first witnessed the sardines circling in the black he could not believe the sight, the beauty of the undulating silver orb below the white and gold lantern light. He said nothing, and the other fishermen were careful to be quiet, too, paddling without motors, lest they scare away the catch. They would whisper over the sea, telling jokes and talking about women and girls as they watched the fish rise and spin beneath them. A few hours later, once the sardines were ready, tens of thousands of them glistening in the refracted light, the fishermen would cinch the net and haul them in. They would motor back to the shore and bring the sardines to the fish broker in the market before dawn. He would pay the men and boys, and would then sell the fish all over western Syria -- Lattakia, Baniyas, Damascus. The fishermen would split the money, with Abdulrahman and Ahmad bringing their share home. Their father had passed away the year before and their mother was of fragile health and mind, so all funds they earned fishing went toward the welfare of the house they shared with ten siblings. Abdulrahman and Ahmad didn't care much about the money, though. They would have done it for free. Thirty-four years later and thousands of miles west, Abdulrahman Zeitoun was in bed on a Friday morning, slowly leaving the moonless Jableh night, a tattered memory of it caught in a morning dream. He was in his home in New Orleans and beside him he could hear his wife Kathy breathing, her exhalations not unlike the shushing of water against the hull of a wooden boat. Otherwise the house was silent. He knew it was near six o'clock, and the peace would not last. The morning light usually woke the kids once it reached their second-story windows. One of the four would open his or her eyes, and from there the movements were brisk, the house quickly growing loud. With one child awake, it was impossible to keep the other three in bed. Kathy woke to a thump upstairs, coming from one of the kids' rooms. She listened closely, praying silently for rest. Each morning there was a delicate period, between six and six-thirty, when there was a chance, however remote, that they could steal another ten or fifteen minutes of sleep. But now there was another thump, and the dog barked, and another thump followed. What was happening in this house? Kathy looked to her husband. He was staring at the ceiling. The day had roared to life. The phone began ringing, today as always, before their feet hit the floor. Kathy and Zeitoun -- most people called him by his last name because they couldn't pronounce his first -- ran a company, Zeitoun A. Painting Contractor LLC, and every day their crews, their clients, everyone with a phone and their number, seemed to think that once the clock struck six-thirty, it was appropriate to call. And they called. Usually there were so many calls at the stroke of six-thirty that the overlap would send half of them straight to voicemail. Kathy took the first one, from a client across town, while Zeitoun shuffled into the shower. Fridays were always busy, but this one promised madness, given the rough weather on the way. There had been rumblings all week about a tropical storm crossing the Florida Keys, a chance it might head north. Though this kind of possibility presented itself every August and didn't raise eyebrows for most, Kathy and Zeitoun's more cautious clients and friends often made preparations. Throughout the morning the callers would want to know if Zeitoun could board up their windows and doors, if he would be clearing his equipment off their property before the winds came. Workers would want to know if they'd be expected to come in that day or the next. ""Zeitoun Painting Contractors,"" Kathy said, trying to sound alert. It was an elderly client, a woman living alone in a Garden District mansion, asking if Zeitoun's crew could come over and board up her windows. ""Sure, of course,"" Kathy said, letting her feet drop heavily to the floor. She was up. Kathy was the business's secretary, bookkeeper, credit department, public-relations manager -- she did everything in the office, while her husband handled the building and painting. The two of them balanced each other well: Zeitoun's English had its limits, so when bills had to be negotiated, hearing Kathy's Louisiana drawl put clients at ease. This was part of the job, helping clients prepare their homes for coming winds. Kathy hadn't given much thought to the storm this client was talking about. It took a lot more than a few downed trees in south Florida to get her attention. ""We'll have a crew over this afternoon,"" Kathy told the woman. Kathy and Zeitoun had been married for eleven years. Zeitoun had come to New Orleans in 1994, by way of Houston and Baton Rouge and a half-dozen other American cities he'd explored as a young man. Kathy had grown up in Baton Rouge and was used to the hurricane routine: the litany of preparations, the waiting and watching, the power outages, the candles and flashlights and buckets catching rain. There seemed to be a half-dozen named storms every August, and they were rarely worth the trouble. This one, named Katrina, would be no different.","Dave Eggers: Abdulrahman Zeitoun grew up in a Syrian fishing town .

"(CNN) -- From soup kitchen director Rita Baldwin's perspective, the notion that ""homeless people are the scum of the earth"" has returned to her Gulf Coast town, which still struggles four years after Hurricane Katrina. Loaves and Fishes executive director Rita Baldwin poses with her son, Scott Blain, who works at the kitchen. Baldwin -- formerly homeless herself -- found that ""the storm was a great neutralizer. It put us all on the same level."" That social pendulum is swinging back to the pre-Katrina world, she said, but she added that the community has shown a renewed sense of compassion. Baldwin, executive director of the Loaves and Fishes community kitchen in Biloxi, Mississippi, lost her home in Katrina as the storm barreled into the coastal community in 2005. She said she watched with sadness as storm victims she dubbed ""amateurs"" -- ""people who didn't know how to be homeless"" -- attempted to survive after losing everything. Homeless people who were accustomed to living in the woods and on the streets used their wherewithal to make it through each day, said Baldwin, who relied on the kitchen's services herself before she was hired there. Biloxi was one of the cities that Katrina hit hardest. And though the city has made progress rebuilding, the 26-year-old kitchen has seen steady increases in clients each year since the storm. With few residents in the city shortly after Katrina, there was little activity. But the kitchen reports serving 55,281 meals in 2007, 64,825 meals in 2008 and 38,877 in the first seven months of 2009. Loaves and Fishes nearly closed this summer because of lack of funding, until the public was reminded of the need to feed the hungry. After the Biloxi Sun-Herald reported in late June that the kitchen could close its doors, more than $50,000 in donations poured in, and it is now funded until around March. ""I certainly had never gotten that kind of response before. So it just made me realize that they just didn't know"" about the hunger problem, Baldwin said. After spending time focusing on themselves and picking up the pieces, the more fortunate Biloxi residents are starting to return to a more philanthropic frame of mind, according to Biloxi Public Affairs Manager Vincent Creel. ""There's been a reawakening. People are getting in a closer position where they can help others,"" he said. 'Hitting us with both fists' Loaves and Fishes hit a ""really bad financial crunch,"" Baldwin said, because its federal grants for disaster relief had run out. She used to provide other services for the homeless, but when the money disappeared, she had to eliminate the additional assistance. ""The economy really didn't get bad for those of us in Katrina areas because so much money was flushed into these areas to help us get back up on our feet. And now those funds are gone, so the ... poor economy and the unemployment is hitting us with both fists now,"" Baldwin said. Baldwin's clients include the expanding homeless population, day laborers, the elderly and other poor people in the area. Terry, 59, who asked that his last name not be used, was homeless for about three years after losing his Gulfport, Mississippi, home in Katrina. He now rents a bedroom and regularly eats at Loaves and Fishes. ""Most everyone just tries to keep to themselves right now,"" Terry said of the atmosphere there. ""[We] struggle, try and get everything back in order. However, the community is binding together and helping each other. So that's a good thing."" Terry learned about six years ago that he had bone cancer, but only recently began receiving disability checks. Before that, it was hard to get work despite all the post-Katrina construction because outside contractors were not hiring locals, he said. Loaves and Fishes also serves down-on-their luck visitors to Biloxi's casinos. ""A lot of people that come in here ... have gambled up their money,"" Baldwin said. ""They max out their credit cards and they get stuck here."" Biloxi's casinos, however, have been struggling over the past year. After showing signs of post-Katrina growth in 2007 with more than $1 billion in revenue, casinos pulled in $951 million last year. They are trending down again this year, according to city data. But A.J. Holloway, Biloxi's mayor, says the city celebrates new milestones of recovery daily. For example, the public school district has rebounded to about 4,600 students from a pre-Katrina population of about 6,100, and around 700 of 1,000 replacement homes have been built at Keesler Air Force Base. The preliminary unemployment rate in Gulfport and Biloxi for June was 7.9 percent, compared with a national rate of 9.4 percent in July. Gulfport-Biloxi's unemployment rate hit 23.2 percent the month after Katrina, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This weekend, the city will break ground on $50 million worth of recovery, including a new library, civic center and visitor center. Holloway also expects a $400 million infrastructure project to begin construction in January, which he hopes will put people to work and stimulate the local economy. He says it will take awhile for Biloxi to return to normal. It probably wasn't until 1992, when the casinos were established, before the city was fully rebuilt after Hurricane Camille in 1969, he said. ""I think we'll feel the effects of Katrina for a long time,"" the mayor said. For now, the area still struggles with poverty, homelessness and hunger, and Loaves and Fishes' Baldwin wants to be there to answer the call. ""There's hunger in our communities,"" she said. ""There's not just hunger in Africa."" Contact Loaves and Fishes at PO Box 233, Biloxi, MS 39522.","As the city recovers from Katrina, Loaves and Fishes sees more visitors .

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- As floodwaters washed away homes in the Lower 9th Ward, Robert Green watched with horror as his mother got swept away in the storm. Robert Green stands on the porch of his family's FEMA trailer in front of his new home earlier this year. Four months later, Green and other family members found Joyce Green's remains in the splintered wreckage of the house where they left her. Robert Green's granddaughter Shanay also drowned the night Hurricane Katrina hit. Green spent almost the entire last four years living in a small FEMA trailer on his land, sharing his story with anyone who came through the Lower 9th. One of the people he met was Tom Darden, executive director of the Make It Right Foundation, Brad Pitt's nonprofit vision for building green, sustainable houses in the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans. Only a handful of homes have returned to the Lower 9th, one of the areas hardest hit by the killer storm. ""We have 14 neighbors and feel crowded,"" Green said ""But we have 3,000 houses that are gone, and we would love to see those houses come back."" Darden and Pitt felt compelled to help provide Green and his family a second chance, and on July 9 Green officially became a proud homeowner once again. Getting a fresh start has helped Green and his family deal with the tragedy that turned their lives upside down and took away their loved ones. ""That's what gave me the strength to endure all that we've been through,"" Green said. ""People constantly coming by, volunteers constantly coming by. People that really care about us and let us know that we weren't in this alone. It gave us the hope that one day we would come back and be a community again.""  Watch as Green talks about his family's tragedies and life in New Orleans after Katrina » . The Make It Right Foundation has built 15 homes in the Lower 9th so far; the group's goal is to have 150 built by the end of next year. Darden said the program is designed as a hand up, not a handout. ""We ask the families to contribute as much as they can afford,"" he said. ""On average that's been about $75,000, but we work with the families very closely to make sure that a family is not spending more than 30 percent of their income towards housing costs, and that's how we ensure they are affordable."" Safety and energy efficiency are among the group's primary concerns. ""[The houses] are all elevated at least above Katrina-level flooding. A family has the option to build even higher than that if they want. We've got hurricane-resistant features like impact-resistant glass, or a certain type of fabric that protects the windows,"" Darden said.  See photos detailing the features of the Make It Right homes » . Another of the driving forces instrumental in rebuilding the Lower 9th Ward in a sustainable fashion is Global Green, the American arm of former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's Green Cross International. ""Immediately after the storm, we saw a failure in government in every level: local, state and federal,"" said Matt Petersen, president of Global Green. ""There's still so much work to be done that we can't wait, we can't rely on the federal government. ""This is an era where I think the citizens of this great country need to take responsibility for our nation, and it starts right here. How we respond affects the future of our country."" Shaun Donovan, secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, knows mistakes were made in the efforts to get people back into their homes, both in the Lower 9th Ward and other devastated parts of New Orleans. ""We have to be more flexible, we have to be more responsive, and make sure the programs don't just work in theory, but they will work for families,"" Donovan said. ""We've been very focused in the first seven months [of the Obama administration] on cutting red tape, making sure that recovery moves ahead. And that we can get as fast as possible to the completion of the recovery phase."" Donovan said HUD's plans will help hundreds of millions of federal dollars be directed to areas across New Orleans, helping rebuild communities and get families into permanent houses. But Donovan also said this could still take another 18-24 months, and that if it weren't for nonprofits there would be little to no progress, even four years after the storm. ""We have to say, 'Look, there are groups on the ground that have solutions, they are able to make it work, we've put barriers in the way for them to be able to get their work done as quickly and effectively as possible. We've got to get those barriers out of the way.' "" For Robert Green, seeing any progress at all gives him hope that one day the place he calls home will no longer be dominated by concrete slabs, abandoned homes and overgrown weeds. ""We have children back in this community, we have families back,"" Green said. ""So basically when those families come back, it gives the other relatives and friends and other people a jump off point.""","Robert Green lost his mother and a granddaughter in Hurricane Katrina .

"(CNN) -- The wooden sculptures lining the median of U.S. 90 are among the top tourist attractions on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Marlin Miller's live oak sculpture in Biloxi's Town Green will be dedicated Saturday. They are also a creative tribute to the live oaks that lined the scenic highway before the saltwater surge of Hurricane Katrina killed them at their very roots. After the storm, the Mississippi Department of Transportation began bulldozing the dead trees, much to the chagrin of area residents. Biloxi Mayor A.J. Holloway, one of the coast's longtime civic leaders, intervened. He contracted to have some of the live oak trunks turned into sculptures. But it would have proved to be a costly venture. Enter Marlin Miller, a wood sculptor from Fort Walton Beach, Florida, who volunteered to create a few live oak sculptures for free -- in part to leave his artistic mark on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, but also as a service to the community. A tree sculpture begins with the transportation department removing all the branches, leaving just the core of the tree. ""I get an idea of what that carving is going to look like, and I go after it with a wide variety of steel chain saws."" Miller said. He works his way down to high speed grinders, sanders and chisels to add the final detail work. ""They're live oaks, so it's like carving stone. Sparks fly off my chain saw blades when I go after one of the trees,"" Miller said. Some of the trees, which are as much a part of south Mississippi's heritage as the antebellum homes scattered along the coastline, are estimated to be as much as 500 or 600 years old. Miller's sculptures along U.S. 90 range from eagles and herons to seahorses and dolphins. He said local governments have never dictated how his carvings should look. In Pass Christian, Miller created what he believes to be the world's largest eagle wood carving, at 25 feet tall. ""That sculpture is dedicated to Col. Lawrence Roberts, one of the original Tuskegee Airmen,"" he said. A recent survey of area tourist attractions by the Harrison County Tourism Commission listed the beaches as the third-most popular attraction and the Beau Rivage Resort and Casino second. Miller's tree sculptures are first. ""We've had a lot of traffic diverting off of Interstate 10, down to U.S. 90 just to see these carvings,"" Miller said. On Saturday, one of Miller's sculptures will be dedicated on the Biloxi Town Green: a 24-foot-tall marlin flying into the sky, three mahi fish jumping to the left, and a sea turtle and a blue crab at the base. It is the only painted tree sculpture of all those lining U.S. 90. Next on Marlin's to-do list: an oak tree in the center of Ocean Springs, Mississippi, and one in Gulfport, Mississippi. He also plans to expand the project to downtown New Orleans and parts of North Carolina. ""Instead of just cutting these trees down,"" Marlin said, ""we're going to put new life into them by adding a sculpture.""","Live oaks lined scenic U.S. 90 before Hurricane Katrina destroyed them .

"(CNN) -- High school athletic director Brian Bordainick felt like he'd been shot when he learned the crushing news about his ""9th Ward Field of Dreams"" project. Coach Shyrone Carey, left, and athletic director Brian Bordainick are rebuilding a once-dominant football team. Architects who had agreed to help the Katrina battered Carver High School in New Orleans, Louisiana, win an NFL grant to build a $2 million stadium were pulling out -- the weekend before a Monday deadline. The firm apologized, Bordainick said, but it would not be able to provide a design proposal for the facility, which was critical to winning the $200,000 grant. ""I've never been shot, but I imagine it felt something similar to that,"" said Bordainick, recalling that day in December 2008. To make matters worse, swarms of news media were gathering at the school to interview the 23-year-old boy wonder -- the self-described ""youngest high school athletic director in Louisiana"" -- who was leading an effort to bring Carver's athletic program back from near death. ""I sucked it up, did the story ... and when they left, I picked up the phone book and started calling architects in the city.""  Watch update on New Orleans' schools after Katrina » . In an amazing moment of serendipity and opportunity, an entrepreneur friend of Bordainick's happened to be at a party and cornered a partner in one of the city's top architectural firms. The friend called Bordainick and -- before handing the architect the phone -- told Bordainick: ""You've got 30 seconds to give your best elevator spiel you've ever given."" The architect was Steve Dumez, design director for Eskew+Dumez+Ripple, who agreed to help, despite Bordainick's preposterous plea. Watch Bordainick tell his story . ""The one-day turnaround came as a bit of a shock,"" Dumez said. ""What was crazy about it was trying to pull together an entire design proposal -- and that's just something that doesn't happen in 24 hours."" Usually such design proposals require as long as a month to complete. ""How could you not get sucked into such an amazing story?"" asked Dumez's partner, Mark Ripple, a 30-year veteran New Orleans architect. ""There really isn't a good outlet in the area where kids can develop skills and self-esteem and all the things that come with a healthy recreation program."" The next day, the firm organized a small army of construction companies, civil engineers and architects who offered their support. ""We got the satellite images and the renderings done in 8 hours,"" Bordainick said. The proposal worked. In March the school learned it had won the NFL grant. Nike also has backed the project -- donating $100,000 and joining thousands of individuals who have offered $1.5 million in pledges, cash and services so far. All this during one of the nation's worst-ever economies. Bordainick credits much of the fundraising success to a network of e-mailers who started with a Web site created by a Web-developer-turned-Carver teacher. He crafted an e-mail touting his ""passion for building character through sports,"" and ""creating something from nothing"" while working with ""people crazy enough to believe that they have the power to create change."" ""I made it a goal to just e-mail a couple hundred people a day,"" he said. ""I was teaching and calling people during my lunch break, and trying to get other people to make calls during their lunch break, and e-mailing people and doing all these things to get the word out about what we're doing and what we're trying to accomplish."" The proposed stadium -- which would host football, track, soccer and lacrosse -- is just one facet of Carver's struggle to regain its former self four years after the ravages of Katrina. A perennial football powerhouse, the team re-formed after Bordainick arrived at Carter in 2007, his first year in the Teach for America program. He touts athletics as ""changing the dynamics of the school and having it not be someplace where the bus just drops you off in the morning."" But four years after the storm, Carver students on the 65-acre campus are still struggling to learn without the benefit of permanent classrooms. All of Carver's 530 students -- down from more than 1,000 students before the storm -- still attend classes in FEMA trailers. The actual building which used to be the school is now boarded up. The cafeteria is a hollowed-out shell. The school district has plans to rebuild Carver's classrooms and other facilities, but it's not clear when. ""If you kick a field goal on one side of our football field -- the ball goes into the gym, which was condemned after the storm,"" said Bordainick. ""And, if you kick a field goal on the other side, it goes into a house which was knocked off its foundation from Katrina."" The track team, he said, now practices on nearby city streets. Last season, the Carver Rams failed to win a single game. But many fans, school officials and alumni are hoping the proposed stadium will increase pride and confidence for the revitalized team and student fans. ""If we give kids some constructive things to be involved in -- guide them and give them discipline, we can help them achieve their dreams,"" said Charles Webb, a project board member and 1965 Carver quarterback. ""It'll bring back pride the way it used to be."" ""With a sense of pride and teamwork, anything can happen,"" said Carver head football coach Shyrone Carey. Carey -- a standout running back for Louisiana State University from 2001 to 2005 -- arguably couldn't have chosen a more challenging post as his first head coaching job than rebuilding Carver from the ground up. ""The overall motivation that comes from athletics is an overall lifelong lesson,"" said Carey, who's pushing his players hard in advance of a big game Saturday. ""If you make the right decisions then positive things can come."" Backers of the 9th Ward Field of Dreams hope to break ground sometime next year and complete construction in time for the 2010 football season. Supporters are trying to bolster support by offering the stadium for use as a free jogging track and a venue for middle school sporting events. ""If we're able to lock sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders in at a younger age, we'll be able to train and get them into mentors' hands so they're able lead a more successful life, ultimately,"" Bordainick said. ""This school -- and these children overcoming the odds stacked against them -- can be a real catalyst for rebirth in this city,"" Bordainick said. ""I think it can be something that people can look to, and something that people can rally behind.""","High school hit hard by Katrina aims to build $2 million sports field with donations .

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- As the storm raged outside her hospital room four years ago, an equally consuming force hijacked Alesia Crockett's mind: deep depression. Alesia Crockett, who suffers from bipolar disorder, ended up in a hospital hours outside New Orleans. For days, Crockett lay in darkness and a tangle of sweaty hospital bed sheets, one among hundreds of desperate patients trapped inside Charity Hospital in 2005, while outside, Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath battered the city. Crockett had been admitted to Charity's inpatient mental health unit after having a psychotic episode. She had struggled for years with bipolar disorder, an illness that causes her to volley between euphoria and profound depression. She said she barely remembers Katrina. ""Most of the time, I was in a fog, but I do remember some things,"" Crockett said. ""Where my room was, I could see thousands of people wandering, and I could see the waters rise."" Crockett, and many other New Orleanians suffering from chronic mental illness -- and those with what is called ""soft depression,"" or nonchronic mental illness -- say Katrina may have relented days after it hit New Orleans proper, but their mental health issues have not. ""Four years later, everything is not all right in New Orleans,"" said Dr. Jan Johnson, a psychiatrist who treats Crockett.  Watch more on New Orleans' mental health crisis » . While mental health problems grow, the resources to treat those problems continue to wane. A report about mental health issues in New Orleans after Katrina, published in early 2008 in the journal Psychiatric Annals, lists the number of inpatient psychiatric beds in greater New Orleans at 487 before the storm. Since Katrina, that number has declined to 190. Most of the remaining beds are dedicated to patients unable to live independently. That leaves what the report's authors describe as a ""paltry"" 17 beds for acute mental health care in New Orleans. ""The situation is unconscionable, atrocious. I can't use enough bad words to describe it,"" said Johnson, who is an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at the Tulane University School of Medicine. ""Patients are not getting care, they are sitting in emergency rooms for days, and that's just an inappropriate place for psychiatric patients."" For two years following Katrina, after being rescued from Charity, Crockett's illness was controlled with medications. Then in 2007, she stopped taking them, and she had another episode. ""She came to my clinic and was psychotic and really a danger to herself not able to care for herself,"" Johnson said. ""And I had nowhere to hospitalize her."" After leaving the clinic, Crockett bounced among three local hospitals before being transported to the closest medical center with an available psychiatric bed, several hours outside of New Orleans. ""I can remember being in the back of an ambulance, and I kept thinking, 'This is taking so long,' "" Crockett said. ""I didn't know where I was going. I just remember seeing the sky turn from daytime to nighttime, and we still hadn't gotten there."" Crockett is far from alone, Johnson says. ""The system has been in horrible shape for a while,"" she said. ""We had our problems even before the storm, but comparatively, we had it much better then. It's very frustrating."" And the consequences of not finding a bed for acutely ill patients can be deadly. In January 2008, a New Orleans police officer was killed by a man suffering from psychosis due to schizophrenia, New Orleans police said. The officer, Nicola Cotton, approached 44-year-old Bernel Johnson for questioning about a rape. A struggle ensued, and Johnson overpowered and killed Cotton with her own gun, police said. As it turns out, Johnson was no longer under psychiatric care and was not taking his prescribed medication. Cotton's death trained a spotlight on the deplorable condition of the New Orleans mental health system -- for a moment -- said Rep. Neil Abramson of the Louisiana House of Representatives. Months after Cotton's death, Louisiana allotted millions of dollars to bolster mental health services in New Orleans, he said. A year later, the funding was gone. ""People are outraged,"" Abramson said. ""Everyone is concerned about consequences you can't quantify. Safety of law enforcement personnel, more psychotic patients out on the street, and more killings instead of people getting the treatment they need."" Abramson is fighting to get back critical inpatient beds. At the center of that fight is the New Orleans Adolescent Hospital (NOAH), which is scheduled to close Tuesday. After Cotton's death in 2008, legislators allotted $14.2 million to NOAH, Abramson says. This year, Gov. Bobby Jindal line-item vetoed that funding. ""That's why this is so critical,"" Abramson said. ""This is the only state-operated mental health facility left in New Orleans. And now there will be none."" Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals spokesperson says that the veto was justified, and that funding appropriated to NOAH would have resulted in a loss of beds at another local hospital. ""This is much bigger than closing NOAH,"" said Alan Levine, secretary of the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals. ""We have to put mental health resources where we know they have the highest opportunity to succeed."" Levine called the debate about NOAH and inpatient beds among New Orleans caregivers and legislators symbolic of overall frustration with mental health care in the area, adding that Louisiana is focusing funding on community-based services, rather than inpatient beds, a strategy that he says will eventually shore up New Orleans' mental health system. Jan Johnson, the New Orleans psychiatrist, agrees about the need for more community-based services. ""It's part of the answer, but it in no way can really take the place of hospital beds that we need,"" she said. ""Someone with diabetes may be managed outpatient, but if they have a heart attack as a result of it, they need an inpatient bed. Our patients are the same way. We can manage a lot of this outpatient and community-based, but when they have an acute psychiatric episode or they are suicidal, they need an inpatient bed."" Today, Crockett, Johnson's patient, is well. But sometimes, fears about tomorrow creep up on her. ""I wonder sometimes, if I were to get sick, where would I go?"" Crockett said. ""We are people battling an illness, and we don't need to also have to be faced with not having the availability of beds and hospitals and doctors. If I want the help that I so desperately need, I can't get it because it's not there.""","New Orleans continues to face crisis of mental health needs, resources .

"(CNN) -- For Thomas Tugend, there was no doubt which side he was fighting for as a young infantryman in Europe in World War II. Actually, the choice was made for him in 1933, when he was just a child. Born in Germany, Tugend lived a comfortable, upper-middle class life in Berlin. His father, Gustav, was a loyal and patriotic German who had fought in World War I and was a decorated officer in the German army. He was also a successful doctor, leaving Thomas with few worries during his childhood in Berlin. Like many of his schoolmates, Thomas was an avid soccer player who gave little thought to the political storm brewing around him. Everything changed in 1933 when Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party came to power. That the Tugend family was successful, educated and loyal Germans no longer meant anything. To the new German government, the Tugends were Jews -- and that was all that mattered. Still, the family remained in a state on denial about the danger they faced because, as Thomas Tugend later said, ""for us, the oppression came gradually, not all at once."" The Tugend's longtime nanny, a mother figure to young Thomas, was forced to leave because of a government edict prohibiting non-Jewish Germans from working in Jewish homes. Then, Thomas' father was told he could no longer treat non-Jewish patients. Shortly thereafter, the elder Tugend was summarily fired from his job in the pediatrics department of a prominent Berlin hospital. As a result, the Tugend family was forced to move from their comfortable home to a poorer part of the city. ""It was little things at first, and people would say, 'Well, we can live with that,' and then another more stringent law would pass and people would say, 'This isn't ideal, but things will get better,'"" Tugend said. By 1937, Tugend's father had no illusions about what was happening. He left Germany for the United States via England with the help of old friends from an American Quaker group. The elder Tugend had worked with them on health issues related to childhood poverty in Germany after World War I. As soon as he was able, Thomas' father sent for his family. ""He told my mother to forget the furniture and pack up what she could and get out,"" Tugend said. In May 1939, Tugend, his sister and their mother entered the United States as refugees. Four months later, the Germans invaded Poland. ""The reason so many German Jews didn't leave when they had the chance was because they couldn't believe what was happening,"" Tugend said. ""They thought Hitler would get what he wanted and there would be no war and things would get back to normal. The Holocaust was unimaginable at the time."" Despite their escape, Tugend said his father was never the same. The whole experience ""broke him, spiritually and physically,"" he said. By 1944, the war was raging in Europe and 18-year-old Thomas was attending high school in the United States. He was raring to join the fight. And he admits his family's tragic experience was only part of the motivation. ""I couldn't wait to get away from home,"" he said. An adventurous spirit mixed with a touch of wanderlust led him to enlist in the U.S. Army. ""Even then I knew the historical significance of the war and I wanted to be a part of it,"" he said. ""I had a personal reason to fight the Nazis that most Americans didn't."" Tugend was assigned to the Army's 63rd Infantry Division. He was worried he might be shipped off to the Pacific, but fate was on his side -- Pvt. Thomas Tugend was sent to France, where he faced his former countrymen in battle. Tugend said he tried not to dwell on the fact that he was fighting his former friends. ""As long as I was just an infantryman, they were shooting at us, we were shooting at them, that's all you think about,"" he said. Once the Army found out Tugend spoke fluent German, his commanders created a new job for him. At the end of the war, Tugend was tasked with finding members of the Nazi party who were thought to be cooking up a post-war insurgency. ""Every town and village I went to,"" Tugend said, ""I would be told, 'No, I'm not a Nazi. But my neighbor, he's a Nazi,' and then the neighbor would say, 'No, no, no. I'm not a Nazi.' There wasn't a Nazi left in Germany."" After some villagers led Tugend to an elderly blind man who was proud to admit his affiliation with the Nazi Party, Tugend returned to his headquarters and proclaimed, ""I found the only Nazi in Germany!"" Tugend may have harbored resentment toward the people who betrayed his family and allowed the murder of 6 million Jews, but on a personal, face-to-face level, he found it difficult to hate them. ""You have to understand, the average German may have known what the Nazis were up to, but I think most of them were just trying to survive,"" he said. ""You would go to some of these bombed-out villages and they had suffered so much, I couldn't hate them. It wasn't like they were the Goebbels or the Goerings. ... We had no pity for the SS. Those were the real bastards."" Tugend left the Army soon after the war's end, but he wasn't finished fighting. He joined the Israeli Army and led an anti-tank crew during the 1948 War of Independence. He was later recalled by the U.S. Army to serve in the Korean War. Instead of going to the front lines, however, he was assigned to run an Army newspaper out of the Presidio in San Francisco. Upon leaving the Army, he became a career journalist working for the San Francisco Chronicle and The Los Angeles Times, and as a science writer and a communications director at UCLA. And age hasn't stopped Tugend from pounding away at the keyboard. He still writes for several different publications, including The Jerusalem Post and The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles. After all these years, Tugend is philosophical about his family's escape from certain death at the hands of the Nazis, and his time as an infantryman at war. ""There were a number of instances in my life where by all the odds I should have been killed,"" he said. ""It just gives me a sense of the utter random chance of life.""","Thomas Tugend fled Nazi Germany with his family for America .

"Editor's note: John Rice is founder and CEO of Management Leadership for Tomorrow (MLT), a New York-based national nonprofit organization seeking to develop ""the next generation of African American, Hispanic and Native American leaders in major corporations, nonprofit organizations and entrepreneurial ventures."" John Rice says there's a tremendous need for new leaders in the nonprofit world. NEW YORK (CNN) -- President Obama has challenged all Americans to participate in the volunteer service movement and to support initiatives that help solve the problems that plague our communities. He recently introduced the Social Innovation Fund, intended to help increase the impact of the most effective and innovative nonprofits in our communities. This is a tremendous step in the right direction, but in order to expand these initiatives, we need a broader pool of leaders with a deep understanding of the communities they are serving and who have the skills, experience and relationships required to succeed in leadership roles. According to the Bridgespan Group, a leading nonprofit consulting firm, the number of vacant senior manager roles in the nonprofit arena is ever increasing, with 24,000 positions available in 2009 alone. Over the next 10 years, this sector will need to attract and develop more than two times the number of people currently employed in order to fill these roles. This next generation of leaders must come from within the communities that struggle most, as these leaders are the most passionate about making change and have the most to gain if successful.   Watch John Rice on preparing for leadership roles » . The good news is that there is an incredible desire among young African-Americans to give back to their communities. Darren Smith is a young investment banker who grew up in one of New York's underserved neighborhoods and won a scholarship to Baruch College in New York, where he graduated with honors. If you were to ask him what he wants to accomplish in his life, he will say that he aspires to do two things: become a business leader and build a nonprofit that has a large impact in the community in which he grew up. He believes that developing strong business skills, broad relationships and a track record of success will prepare him to maximize his impact in the community. Smith is one of thousands of talented African-American students and young professionals eager to become corporate or entrepreneurial leaders in sectors such as finance, technology, consulting and entertainment, where they have a broad sphere of influence that extends into their communities. Yet minority leaders remain dramatically under-represented in leadership positions and in the pipeline to those roles. Despite representing 13.5 percent of the U.S. population, African-Americans hold less than 3 percent of senior executive positions and represent only 5 percent of MBA graduates. To address this issue, I founded Management Leadership for Tomorrow (MLT), a nonprofit that provides high-potential young people such as Smith with the ""key ingredients"" they need to realize their career potential -- the step by step career roadmap, coaching and mentoring, hard and soft skill development, door-opening relationships and a high-performing peer community. Every senior leader would say they would not be where they are today if they had not gotten some or all of these ingredients, but remarkably these key ingredients are not taught in even the best schools. Instead they are passed down through informal channels to which minorities still have more limited access. As a result, too many African-Americans who overcome a challenging home environment and troubled K-12 education system to attend college are not achieving their full career potential. Here at MLT, we have had exciting results to date: nearly 40 percent of the minority students at top business schools such as Harvard, Wharton and Kellogg completed MLT's MBA Prep program and 95 percent of the undergraduates who complete our Career Prep program land fast-track jobs at America's leading firms across all sectors. While participating in MLT's Career Prep program as a college student, Smith and several other MLT fellows founded a mentoring organization that prepares high school students from New York's most underserved communities for college. Like Smith, nearly 90 percent of our alumni desire to launch or lead a nonprofit organization at some point in their careers, and many are already well down the path. To harness this potential, MLT has built a robust curriculum that prepares our fellows to enter and succeed in the social entrepreneurship sector, and we partner with leading nonprofits and foundations such as Teach for America, Stand for Children, New Profit, The Knight Foundation and Blue Ridge Foundation to connect MLT alumni to other talent pipelines. Despite these advances, there is still much more to be done. It is not enough to get African-Americans into fast-track entry-level positions or MBA programs; we need a comprehensive, multistage approach to enable them to overcome hurdles they will encounter along the path to the senior leadership levels. Research shows that the largest challenge for minorities is the transition from middle management to senior management, so more investment is needed at that stage. By helping to grow organizations such as MLT and other successful talent development initiatives, I believe that we will succeed in filling the growing leadership gap in corporations, nonprofits, entrepreneurial ventures and the government. Once there, African-Americans and other under-represented minorities will have the passion, financial capital, experience and relationships they need to be change agents in the communities that are in desperate need of our support. The success of our nation depends on it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Rice.","John Rice: President Obama is stressing need for national service .

"Washington (CNN) -- Long before people posted their thoughts and feelings on social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook, millions of people were doing just that on a different sort of wall. It might have been something as simple as a baseball, a playing card or a walking stick. Or perhaps a more personal item, like a poem, photograph or diploma. And then there's the occasional letter, like the one dated November 18, 1989, that began: . Dear Sir, . For twenty two years, I have carried your picture in my wallet. I was only eighteen years old that day that we faced each other on that trail in Chu Lai, Vietnam. Why you did not take my life, I will never know. ... These are among the more than 100,000 objects that have been left at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the National Mall. Since its dedication in 1982, nearly 4 million people a year have visited the memorial's polished black granite wall, many to leave a personal item or note in memory of the more than 58,000 people whose names are engraved there. No one is sure who started the custom of leaving items at the wall, curator Duery Felton said. The first items began showing up even before construction on the memorial was complete. A park ranger started collecting the items, thinking people might come back for them someday. By 1986, as the objects continued to pile up, the National Park Service decided to establish an official collection. Thus was born the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Collection. The items are catalogued 12 miles away at the Museum and Archaeological Regional Storage facility in Maryland. Though it's not open to the public, traveling collections are often on display at museums both in the United States and abroad, Felton said. ""You had, for the first time that we've been able to ascertain, people coming to a public site for a protracted period and leaving unsolicited objects,"" Felton said. There is seemingly no limit to the types of artifacts that are part of the collection, from G.I. Joe action figures to crutches, dog tags, combat boots -- even a motorcycle. On any given day, the wall might be adorned with artwork, prayers, a diploma marking a missed milestone or a picture of a young child born too late for a loved one to meet. Occasionally, a note accompanies an item, but most times an object's meaning is left to interpretation. Felton, a Vietnam veteran himself, says he's wary of making assumptions about an item's meaning. Many may seem like ordinary objects, but often they hold deeper significance to either the donor or one being remembered. Felton likes to use a bag of M&Ms to make his point. The candy, which gained popularity among World War II soldiers looking for a chocolate treat that wouldn't melt, may have been left at the wall because it was a loved one's favorite, he says. More likely, though, it had something to do with the little-known fact that military doctors used M&Ms as placebos for injured soldiers when no aspirin was available. ""I look at us as being voyeurs in many ways, because we don't know the full story,"" he said. ""Outside of donor information, I can't tell you why [an] item was left."" On a more comprehensive scale, the collection serves as a record of social history, he said. The egalitarian nature of the memorial and the unprecedented public outrage that resulted from the controversial war are not unrelated, Felton said. ""This is a study. This is tangible evidence of a major epoch on the psyche of the American public,"" Felton said. ""For all intents and purposes, this collection is being curated by the public. ... It's uncensored."" And as Vietnam veterans age, it even more important to preserve these artifacts for future generations, he said. ""Almost 60 percent of today's population was not alive during Vietnam,"" he said. ""You can't tell where you are until you understand where you've been. ... We're preserving the past for the future.""","More than 100,000 objects have been left at Vietnam Veterans Memorial .

"Washington (CNN) -- In the Army you live by the Warrior Ethos, which states, ""I will always place the mission first. I will never quit. I will never accept defeat. I will never leave a fallen comrade behind."" I am alive today because my helicopter crew lived by these words. When our aircraft was shot down in November 2004, the injuries I sustained were devastating. The amount of blood I had lost in a matter of minutes was so vast that my crew thought I was dead. They could have left me in that dusty field in Iraq, but they didn't. Instead, they stood their ground in the face of approaching enemy, risked their lives, and carried me to safety. They did this regardless of whether I was dead or alive, because the American warrior does not leave a fallen comrade behind. My crew and all the men and women in the U.S. armed forces know what it means to be a part of something greater than themselves. They are America's finest sons and daughters, and we made a promise to care for them after they serve. It is our job in the Department of Veterans Affairs to make sure that promise is kept. We at VA stand at a historic time with great opportunities to further our mission in caring for the nation's 23.4 million veterans and their families. With the largest one-year percentage increase in VA's budget in over three decades, President Obama has made it very clear that serving our nation's veterans is a top priority in his administration. He wants to increase funding for VA by $25 billion above our current baseline over the next five years. He launched a new initiative to expand eligibility for veterans' health care to as many as 500,000 Priority Group 8 Veterans who were previously denied care. And he wants us to invest in better technology to deliver services and benefits to veterans with the quality and efficiency they deserve. As commander in chief, President Obama has charged Secretary Eric Shinseki and all of VA's leadership with a new mission: to transform VA into a 21st-century organization. Secretary Shinseki has begun to do just that by making VA a more veteran-centered, results-oriented and forward-looking department. It will be a different organization from the one that exists today. It will be accessible, responsive and transparent. To achieve the president's vision, we must leverage new technologies to serve the various demographics and needs of today's veterans, while also renewing our commitment to the older generation of veterans. These technologies will carry us well into the 21st century as we maintain our mission to serve our nation's veterans for the rest of their lives. Tonight, 131,000 veterans will sleep on the streets of our cities. These are the same men and women who allowed us to have the opportunities to go to school, get a job and buy a home. We are all dishonored anytime a veteran is forced to sleep on the streets, and President Obama, Secretary Shinseki and the VA leadership team will not stand for this. Within the next five years, we aim to eliminate veteran homelessness by providing grants to community-based organizations assisting homeless veterans and by attacking all the areas that often lead to homelessness. Our veterans deserve better, and we are determined to provide them the best care and most timely benefits possible to end homelessness in their ranks. We will improve medical care to minority veterans, including female veterans, who are enrolling in VA at historic rates. We will also improve access to VA for veterans who live in rural areas. All our veterans deserve the best care possible regardless of race, gender or where they live. And we are working with the Department of Defense to build a fully interoperable electronic records system that will provide each member of our military with a Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record. For VA, this will revolutionize our claims process by making it faster with higher-quality decisions and with fewer errors. Five years from now, we intend to make VA the provider of choice for veterans -- in insurance, health care, education, home loans and counseling. We are going to be the advocate for veterans, their dependents and survivors to make sure we meet their needs, hear their concerns, and take proper action. We know that we have a big task ahead of us. But there is not a population more deserving of the absolute best than the men and women who have sacrificed so much for our freedoms. In the same way that my crew refused to leave me behind, each and every one of us at VA will fight everyday for our nation's military heroes to ensure that they are never left behind. It is our turn to serve America's warriors, and we at VA consider it a privilege.","American warrior doesn't leave a fallen comrade behind, VA official says .

"Washington (CNN) -- The aging veterans gingerly walk from the plane in the nation's capital. Some get pushed in wheelchairs. A brass band strikes up World War II era tunes. Strangers rise to their feet and clap their hands. ""Why are they doing this?"" says Frank Bales, 86, a co-pilot on a B-24 during World War II. ""I feel as humbled as a mouse."" Walter Victor was overwhelmed as he made his way through the crowd. ""The chills came over me. Very seldom do you see something like that,"" says the 92-year-old army veteran. These World War II veterans have traveled here to visit the National World War II Memorial, which honors the 16 million U.S. armed forces who served and the more than 400,000 who died in battle. The vets made the trip thanks to a former employee at the Department of Veterans Affairs. A physician's assistant at the VA in Springfield, Ohio, Earl Morse was struck by the WWII vets he treated and how few made the journey to see the memorial that honors them. ""They dedicated the WWII memorial in May of 2004, 60 years after the war had ended. That was a cause of celebration in my clinic. All of the veterans wanted to see it but they were in poor health or didn't have the means to visit it."" ""Reality set in,"" Morse says, ""they were never going to see their memorial."" Morse was determined to change that, because he so admired the quiet grit and heroism of the unassuming men he treated every day. He took his cause to a local air club. ""I stood before 150 pilots and told them I was going to start flying WWII veterans to Washington. I said if you want to help me, the WWII veteran doesn't pay a penny. You'll have to rent an airplane and cover all the travel costs."" ""Honor Flight"" took to the skies in May of 2005. Six planes flew 12 veterans. The next month, eight planes flew 16 veterans. Today, it operates like a volunteer airline, with 86 hubs in 33 states. Instead of renting small planes, they charter Boeing jets, thanks to donations that keep the planes in the sky. So far, more than 30,000 veterans have experienced a visit to the memorial, courtesy of Honor Flight. ""Witnessing their emotions is what fuels our cause. When you see WWII veterans break down in tears because they had no idea how much this nation reveres, cherishes and loves them for what they've done, it really overwhelms them,"" Morse says. In the days and weeks before each Honor Flight, an army of ground volunteers coordinates every detail of each trip -- from the buses that pick them up to the meals they eat. Shortly after Bales and his group arrived in Washington this day, they were taken by bus to the memorial. Many said they were stunned by its size and scope. Inscriptions carved in granite recognize specific battles that were fought in Europe and across the Pacific. A wall of stars marks the high price of freedom. They paused to remember the 448,000 who died in the war -- and their fellow survivors who didn't live to see this moment. ""Each of those stars represents 100 men and women who died in WWII, and I realized that my division has almost 39 stars on that wall,"" said Tom Rone, 85, who stormed the bullet-ridden beaches on Guadalcanal as a platoon sergeant with the Marines. Morse says the trip often provides closure for the vets who visit. Many veterans open up at the memorial and speak in detail for the first time about what they went through. ""I've had exchanges with veterans that are jaw dropping,"" Morse says. ""You can't fathom what it's like to have experienced what they went through fighting for their lives."" The same ""Honor Flight"" that transported the veterans to Washington returns them back home, landing just 12 hours after it took off. The elderly warriors seem renewed rather than exhausted by their whirlwind trip. ""I will never forget this,"" say 86-year-old Marcus Lee Long, who served in the Pacific on the USS Ellet. ""Everybody is so happy and treating us so nice."" Allen Pittard, 88, added, ""I feel so fortunate to be here. So many didn't make it."" For Morse, the founder of Honor Flight, the end of each flight is a bittersweet experience. His mission continues with an air of urgency, because less than 10 percent of the Americans who served in World War II are still alive. An estimated 1,200 WWII veterans die every day. ""In another five to seven years, our efforts will be a moot point because they will be gone or too infirm to participate in a mission like this,"" he says.","Program called Honor Flight takes WWII vets to see memorial in Washington .

"Editor's note: Jameel Jaffer and Amrit Singh are attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union and co-authors of ""Administration of Torture: A Documentary Record from Washington to Abu Ghraib and Beyond"". Jaffer is counsel to the plaintiffs in ACLU v. Department of Defense, a lawsuit that has forced the release of more than 100,000 pages of government documents concerning the abuse of prisoners. Singh is lead counsel in the suit seeking disclosure of photographs of U.S. personnel abusing prisoners at overseas locations. Jameel Jaffer says the courts have ruled that refusal to disclose the abuse photos was unlawful. (CNN) -- Last week President Obama announced that he would suppress prisoner abuse photographs that he earlier said he would release. Given the president's stated commitment to government transparency, this reversal was both surprising and profoundly disappointing. The ACLU has sought release of these photos for almost six years. In October 2003, we filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act for records -- including photographs -- relating to the abuse of prisoners in U.S. detention facilities overseas. In 2005, a federal judge in New York ruled that the Bush administration's refusal to disclose the photographs was unlawful, and in 2008 a federal appeals court unanimously affirmed that decision. The Bush administration continued to suppress the photos, and now President Obama has vowed to do the same. The photos are a critical part of the historical record. The government has acknowledged that they depict prisoner abuse at locations other than Abu Ghraib, and it's clear that the photos would provide irrefutable evidence that abuse was widespread and systemic. The photos would also shed light on the connection between the abuse and the decisions of high-level Bush administration officials. As the district court recognized, the photos are ""the best evidence of what happened."" In explaining his change of heart, President Obama said that the release of the photos ""would not add any additional benefit"" to the ongoing public debate about the abuse of prisoners. But the ongoing public debate is rife with false claims, and the photos would expose the truth. The Bush administration told the public that abuse was aberrational and isolated, and many media organizations adopted this fraudulent narrative as their own. But even President Obama, in explaining his reversal, perpetuated the myth that the abuse of prisoners ""was carried out in the past by a small number of individuals."" President Obama's statement was meant to explain why the photos would not inform the public debate, but it only underscored why the release of the photographs is so important. Many Americans still believe that abuse took place in spite of policy rather than because of it. The truth is that senior officials authorized the use of barbaric interrogation methods that the U.S. once prosecuted as war crimes, and even abuse that was not expressly authorized was traceable to a climate in which abuse was tolerated and often encouraged. The photos would help tell this story. President Obama's other rationale for suppressing the photographs is that they would ""inflame anti-American opinion and put our troops in greater danger,"" an argument that was repeatedly rejected by the courts when made by the Bush administration. Nobody, of course, wants to see anyone get hurt by the release of this or any other information. But the fundamental problem with the government's argument is that it lacks a limiting principle. Any photograph of prisoner abuse, civilian casualties in Afghanistan, or U.S. military operations in Iraq could be used to ""inflame anti-American opinion""; indeed, the same is true of any news article that discusses (for example) torture, Guantanamo, or the CIA's secret prisons. iReport.com: Did Obama make the right decision on photos? To give the government the power to suppress information because it might anger an unidentified set of people in an unspecified part of the world and ultimately endanger an ill-defined group of U.S. personnel would be to invest it with a virtually unlimited censorial power. And by investing it with such power, we would effectively be affording the greatest protection from disclosure to records that depict the worst kinds of government misconduct. President Obama has inherited a legacy of lawlessness and abuse, and it's not easy to untangle that. But the idea that suppressing the photographs will help the country turn the page on the last eight years is misguided. We cannot make a clean break with the past until the public knows what happened in the detention centers and why. Blinding ourselves to the ugly consequences of the Bush administration's policies only deprives us of the opportunity to learn from recent history. And if we fail to learn from this history, we are bound to repeat it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jameel Jaffer and Amrit Singh.","ACLU lawyers: We filed Freedom of Information request for abuse records .

"Bountiful, Utah (CNN) -- It was two weeks after D-Day, a few miles from the bloody shores of Omaha Beach. An airstrip had been carved out of the Normandy countryside, costing the lives of 28 Army engineers at the hands of German snipers. A lone sniper still remained in the nighttime distance. Despite the risk, Capt. Jack Tueller felt compelled to play his trumpet. That afternoon, his P-47 fighter group had caught up with a retreating German Panzer division. As the U.S. Thunderbolts descended on their targets, they saw French women and children on top of the tanks. After an initial fly-by, the order was given to attack anyway. ""We were told those human shields were expendable,"" Tueller said. Back at the airstrip, Tueller took out his trumpet. He'd used it on many a starlit night to entertain the men of the 508th Squadron 404th Fighter Group. ""I was told, 'Captain, don't play tonight; your trumpet makes the most glorious sound,' but I was stressed,"" he said. He was so troubled that he was willing to take a chance the sniper wouldn't fire. ""I thought to myself, that German sniper is as lonely and scared as I am. How can I stop him from firing? So I played that German's love song, 'Lilly Marlene,' made famous in the late '30s by Marlene Dietrich, the famous German actress. And I wailed that trumpet over those apple orchards of Normandy, and he didn't fire."" The next morning, the military police came up to Tueller and told him they had a German prisoner on the beach who kept asking, ""Who played that trumpet last night?"" ""I grabbed my trumpet and went down to the beach. There was a 19-year-old German, scared and lonesome. He was dressed like a French peasant to cloak his role as a sniper. And, crying, he said, 'I couldn't fire because I thought of my fiancé. I thought of my mother and father,' and he says, 'My role is finished.' ""He stuck out his hand, and I shook the hand of the enemy,"" Tueller said. ""[But] he was no enemy, because music had soothed the savage beast."" ""Boy, you have strong lips"" Tueller had learned to play the trumpet as a child growing up in Wyoming. His mother, a nurse, died at 29, and his father, a bartender and alcoholic, left the next day -- leaving Jack and his brother, Bob, orphans. They left their home in Superior to live with an aunt in nearby Evanston. She gave Jack his first trumpet, and he quickly discovered he had a musical ear. ""In 1939, I was playing in Yellowstone Park in a dance band of 22 musicians at Lake Hotel. The famous trumpet player Louis Armstrong came up to the band during intermission and said, 'You sound pretty good for white cats,' "" Tueller recalled. He asked Armstrong what advice he would give a young trumpet player. ""He said, 'Always play the melody, man. Look at them, see their age group, play their love songs, and you'll carry all the money to the bank.' "" Tueller enrolled at Brigham Young University, where he met his future wife and fellow trumpeter, Marjorie. ""This beautiful brown-haired gal with luscious lips said, 'Did you play the trumpet solo at the freshman assembly?' And I said, 'Yes, ma'am, I did.' She said, 'Boy, you have strong lips.' Being a sophomore, I said, 'Would you like to try me?' She nodded, and I went over and kissed her."" In 1941, as war clouds gathered, Jack enlisted in the Army and was sent to fighter school because he was an ""individualist,"" he said. ""I wanted to fly it, fire it, navigate it, shoot the guns."" He once flew his plane through a dirigible hangar at Moffitt Field in Sunnyvale, California. The commandant was fuming mad. ""He stood me in a brace, then he kind of smiled and says, 'We don't want to quell spirit like that ... but don't do it again!'"" When D-Day arrived on June 6, 1944, Tueller was in the air, flying five missions. ""I witnessed the invasion from a ringside seat. We saw 2 million men, 10,000 ships. And we just shot at everything,"" he said. ""We tried to help those men trying to get off the landing craft at high tide, where a lot of them were drowned. ""I remember feeling pride and sadness as I saw the bodies of 4,000 killed in two hours."" Tueller credits common sense and his first flight instructor, a crop duster, with his survival that day -- and the rest of the war. ""I learned to love low-level flying. I never came off enemy targets high. I'd lay it down a row of trees 400 knots, a foot off the ground, so all the flak would go over my head. They'd wonder where I'd gone."" Trumpet in the cockpit . Tueller managed to fly 140 missions without taking a single bullet hole to his airplane -- the name of his infant daughter, Rosanne, painted on the side. ""Everyone wanted to fly it; they thought it let a charmed life."" And on each mission, Tueller carried his trumpet in the cockpit. ""I took it in a little canvas bag attached to my parachute. I figured if I ever got shot down, it would go with me, and if I survived and got put into a prisoner of war camp, I could get an extra bar of soap from the guard."" His tour of duty ended just before his fighter group left for Belgium and the Battle of the Bulge. Three months later, his plane was shot down and destroyed. The pilot was killed. Tueller went on to fight in the Korean and Vietnam wars, and served in the Pentagon during the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Cold War. He retired in 1966 as a colonel, having earned the Distinguished Flying Cross, almost two dozen air medals and two Legions of Merit, the nation's highest peacetime award. Now 89, Tueller takes care of Marjorie, his wife of 68 years, who has Alzheimer's disease. As Veterans Day approaches, he has a word of advice to veterans: ""When you become a veteran, it's my opinion that you should do everything to make people realize the wonderful life that you really have.""

"Editor's note: Malaak Compton-Rock is founder and director of The Angelrock Project, ""an online e-village promoting volunteerism, social responsibility, and sustainable change."" One of her initiatives, ""Journey for Change: Empowering Youth Through Global Service,"" will be seen as part of CNN's ""Black in America 2."" Her first book is being published by Broadway Books in May, 2010, titled, ""If It Takes a Village, Build One: How I Found Meaning Through a Life of Service to Others and 100+ Ways You Can Too."" Malaak Compton-Rock says focusing on problems facing African-Americans is difficult but necessary. (CNN) -- In the words of my mentor and America's foremost child advocate Marian Wright Edelman, founder and president of The Children's Defense Fund, it's time to ""raise a ruckus people, it is time to raise a ruckus!"" CNN's ""Black in America"" raised many critical issues facing African-American people in this great country of ours. It was not pretty, it was not flattering, but it was very, very frank. The show delved into the negative issues that have plagued the African-American community for generations, i.e., crime, education, single parent families, drug abuse and the like. People got mad. People sent many e-mails and letters to Soledad O'Brien and CNN and cried foul. People said ""Black in America"" was not consistent with the lives of many African-American people and was one-sided. Blogs and Web sites popped up all over the place where people ""raised a ruckus"" about the content of the show. I read a lot of these comments. As a matter of fact, I was obsessed with people's views for many weeks after the documentary aired. And the more I read, the more I got angry. The more I read, the more I wanted to ""raise my own ruckus."" But I was frustrated and upset for a very different reason than most. I was almost apoplectic with the amount of criticism for ""Black in America"" without critical, thought provoking commentary about how each person can do their part to make a difference to change the very startling and distressing issues facing most African-American children and adults in America. On a typical day in the lives of black American children: . And on a typical school day for black children in America: . And consider that in America, . [Statistics are from the Children's Defense Fund's Child Research Data.] . This is serious stuff people. And it is the cold-hearted truth. So, it is okay to comment that the documentary did not represent your life. It is okay to comment that it was upsetting to see images of black men in jail, children dropping out of school, and unwed mothers. It is okay because the truth hurts, especially when it is seen by 16 million people. In fact, most of the images shown in ""Black in America"" do not represent my personal life or the lives of my children. But because these issues face my brothers and sisters in my collective African-American family, they concern me, they hurt me, they belong to me, and I will own them. We know that as African-Americans we have come a long way. We know that we are doctors, lawyers, CEOs, philanthropists, politicians, and even the president of the United States of America. And yes, it would do our children a lot of good if these images were portrayed more frequently in the media. But this does not change the very real issues facing African-American people portrayed in ""Black in America."" And frankly, with so many of our people struggling, we can't just celebrate our achievements -- we must make it a priority to work on the most critical and urgent matters in our community. As I always say, ""The blessed and the best of us, must take care of the rest of us."" So why did the criticism make me so mad? Because so much of it was unaccompanied by real ideas, thought-provoking suggestions, plans of action, or inspiring initiatives or solutions. How can you complain if you are unwilling to join the fight? How can you get mad, if you are disinclined to make a difference in someone else's life? And why would you take the time to write an accusatory e-mail to Soledad O'Brien instead of writing a letter to your representative in Congress demanding health care for all children and pregnant women, increased funding for schools, or new initiatives to increase black-owned businesses in black neighborhoods? ""Black in America 2"" will offer many solutions to the ills facing African-American people. I think it will make the naysayers happy. But it will only make me happy if the naysayers ""raise a ruckus"" by joining the fight to better the lives of all black folks. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Malaak Compton-Rock.","Malaak Compton-Rock: Some critical of ""Black in America"" focus on problems .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The one-star general almost yells when asked to talk about the infamous Abu Ghraib photos showing U.S. soldiers abusing Iraqi detainees. An Iraqi detainee grips a fence at Camp Cropper, one of the few U.S. detention centers remaining in Iraq. ""If we had had a company commander doing what he was supposed to be doing, a battalion commander doing what he was supposed to be doing ...,"" Brig. Gen. David Quantock said. He carried on -- growing more and more angry. So the next obvious question was, ""It makes you angry?"" ""It does make me angry,"" he said. ""Because I think we lost a lot of American lives because of those photos."" And there it is -- the issue of detainee abuse and what the U.S. military struggles with, and has struggled with, since the release of those photos in 2004, some of which showed naked prisoners being humiliated, stacked in piles or subjected to mock torture. Quantock, the head of detainee operations in Iraq, is echoing a debate raging in Washington. Another round of photos allegedly showing further abuse of prisoners was to be released by the end of this month. But President Obama asked that the photos be held back. Obama said he believed the release of the pictures could put American lives in danger. That is Catch-22 situation No. 1: on one hand transparency; on the other, the safety of U.S. troops. Quantock agreed with his commander in chief. ""The jihadists have used those pictures. And it has spurred some of the violence,"" he said. Walking through Camp Cropper -- one of the last remaining U.S. detention centers in Iraq -- it is clear the damaging photos have forced the United States to become more transparent in its dealings with prisoners. Detainees are now checked before and after interrogations to ensure the guards have not abused them. Officers who walk the catwalk, the long metal walkway that surrounds the sprawling yard housing the detainees, have more oversight. These institutional checks reduce the possibility that abuse could reach the same scale as it did in Abu Ghraib in 2003. The camp itself has a strange feeling to it. Visitors are told to put on sunglasses before entering some of the holding areas. Many of the detainees spit and even throw their own fecal matter at the guards, officials said. Inmates in American detention with arrest warrants against them will be turned over to Iraqi authorities under the terms of the U.S.-Iraqi security agreement. All others will be released. But the United States has signed the international treaty against torture, which compels a nation to keep suspects detained rather than send them to another country if that other country might ill-treat them. ""Iraqi detention facilities are not good; they are not like American facilities,"" said a woman who had just visited her detainee husband at Camp Cropper. ""There is a lot of witness testimony from detainees who suffered maltreatment in Iraqi detention facilities."" A U.N. report examining the second half of 2008 agreed, saying that detention centers run by Iraqis are using torture and physical abuse to extract confessions. The lingering questions about Iraqi detention facilities create Catch-22 situation No. 2. The United States very much wants not only to get out of Iraq, but to get out of the detainee operation business. But it has a legal bar to satisfy. For its part, the U.S. military said it is inspecting and monitoring nine of the Iraqi facilities where its detainees will go. Iraqi government authorities maintain that they are treating all prisoners in accordance with international law. But when the United States pulls its last troops form Iraq, the monitoring is likely to stop. Nongovernmental organizations have been denied access, and CNN recently has not been allowed into any Iraqi prison.","U.S. head of detainee operations in Iraq is angered by Abu Ghraib photos .

"(CNN) -- I have vivid memories of childhood. The 5-year-old girl with endless questions; she wanted to discover the secrets of the entire world within minutes. She dreamed of being a doctor once, an engineer another time, and a mother of lovely kids. A dreamer, this is how I would describe the little girl Reem. Reem is a 22-year-old student living in Gaza City. Days passed fast. Reem couldn't remember a lot of them, but she had some moments left in her memory -- usually the happy moments of her life -- and those memories were the basis for today's Reem, the 22-year-old girl who is ME. I remember how happy I was when my teacher announced to the school that I was first in my class. I remember my mother's voice singing to me before I fell asleep; I remember my father running behind my kite when I lost it in the air, and I remember me asking my parents for a real monkey as a pet. I can't forget the day I finished high school; I felt so grown up. I remember the day when the school announced the exam results and the tears of happiness my mother shed when I received a grade of excellent, and then I decided to enroll in the college of Business Administration. I can call Gaza City the city of qualifications, where a lot of youth are qualified for good jobs. I am one of those youth who is volunteering in organizations, participating in community service activities, getting trained in various skills and getting more qualified day by day. But many young people like me cannot find jobs.  See perspectives from Palestinian youth » . Sometimes, I feel disconnected from Gaza, but whenever I see the photos of Jaffa, I realize that it's where I and a thousand refugees belong. I find myself crying, missing a place I have never been to, but it's where my parents and my grandparents lived. I remember all those bedtime stories my grandmother used to tell me about the land, the fence of roses they had, and her climbing trees and cutting fruits. How I miss that place. But life must go on. My day starts with the smile of optimism and the plan of my day. Waking up early to go to my university; I have to attend all of my lectures even though some are boring. My friends are a big part of my day. We start with our updates and then go to courses where we can develop our skills. When I arrive home, I feel so exhausted, but still I continue working and studying hard. I am always looking for chances for personal development, whether through volunteer work or at school. I was offered a great opportunity to volunteer with the aid organization Mercy Corps as a founding member of the Why Not? youth program, and then I had the pleasure of seeing this program blossom into the Global Citizen Corps, or GCC, a cultural exchange between Palestinian and American students. I believe this program is deeply important because it changes the negative impression of Palestinian youth that is too often spread by media. All my friends and 1,000 others are engaged in this program, which develops our personalities, our skills and serves the community. We use digital media as a tool to express what we feel and what we do. We make changes in ourselves, in our community, and we pave the way for global change. We are thinking globally and acting locally. My ambition is to be a researcher in business studies all over the world. I finished my B.A. and a diploma of business studies, and I hope to obtain a scholarship to do graduate work in media and development. I am also interested in the field of project management and human interaction management. I know it is a good ambition to be Ph.D. holder and a worldwide researcher, but as Palestinian girl, I have fewer opportunities, not because I am not qualified or hard-working enough but because I am Palestinian. Usually Palestinian students have fewer opportunities than others to get scholarships, because it's hard for them to leave the Gaza Strip, as all of the borders are closed. But I have not lost hope, and I will not. I will keep trying to pursue my dream of being the researcher I want to be. It's true that I am a girl, and girls face some challenges in our society. For example, I can't stay a late hour at work. But I am so happy and honored to be a Muslim; putting the scarf on my head is something that I love. To many foreigners, it might seem to be against women's freedom, but I can tell that when a lady is convinced of it, it becomes part of her self-esteem, her self-confidence and her protection each day. I feel sad when the world gets angry at Muslim girls while they are peaceful and happy, enjoying their choices and freedom. I found that I'm not that different from Catherine, who lives in the United States and whom I contact through the Global Citizen Corps. I have realized how similar Palestinian youth are to youth all over the world. Catherine likes some of the food I like, and she loves swimming just like I do. There are also lovely differences between us: I tried to cook what she taught me once, and she is learning Arabic now. Maybe our lifestyle is different. I focus on my own development; I spend most of my time working to become a more qualified person with more knowledge and skills. I do not work hard because I am super girl or I aspire to be one but because I always want to be ready for the worst situation. In Palestine where I live, surprises can happen at any time, and I don't want to be caught off guard. I want to make my future secure by being a really good person. I deserve to live. I enjoy my life as it is now, but I hope that when I find a scholarship and live in the West, I will not be obliged to take off my scarf and won't hear negative comments about me because I am Muslim. I consider religion a personal freedom that is related to your beliefs and what you feel in your heart. I love letting others live in peace. ... Why can't we enjoy peace, too?

"New York (CNN) -- Investigators suspect arson in a fire that killed five Guatemalan immigrants in Brooklyn, they said Monday. ""People are all concerned and very sad,"" said Maria Luz de Zyriek, the Guatemalan consul in New York. ""This is a horrible tragedy."" Authorities continue to investigate and have not formally determined a cause, the Fire Department of New York said. The blaze damaged a restaurant and apartments in a three-story building in the Bensonhurst neighborhood, Frank Dwyer, a fire department spokesman, has said. Luisa Chan, a mother of two, died in the blaze, said Mario Alvarado, a member of Jovenes Cristianos -- Christian Youth, a church with about 200 members, most of them Guatemalan immigrants, on 17th Avenue in Brooklyn. Chan usually attended services on Tuesday, Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday, Alvarado said. The congregation mourned her on Sunday. ""The service was so quiet,"" he said. Are you there? Share your story . Investigators have not publicly identified the victims, but the Guatemalan consul said they were all from the western part of the country. Two were from the state of Totonicapan and three were from the state of Quetzaltenango, she said. After the fire broke out, Chan managed to get her 2-year-old son to safety, apparently by handing him to someone on the floor below, and threw her 2-month-old daughter toward a passerby, said Alvarado, who said he received that account from someone close to the family. ""Thank God they're safe,"" he said. A 2-month-old baby was in critical condition, fire officials said, but the child was not immediately identified; three other people sustained injuries ranging from serious to minor. Thirteen firefighters sustained minor injuries. The fire started about 2:30 a.m. Saturday behind a door in one of the apartment units, Dwyer said. ""If somebody starts a fire there intentionally, that would certainly be looking to kill somebody, because there's no way for them to get out,"" Fire Commissioner Salvatore Cassano said. At Chan's church, members in mourning were waiting Monday for more information from authorities, Alvarado said. They also were getting ready for a memorial service and trying to comfort Chan's husband, who survived the fire, the consul said. ""The husband and wife belonged to that church. Everybody there knew them,"" said Luz, who went to the church during the weekend. ""Everybody there was so sad. Everybody was crying and praying for the husband,"" she said. ""He's going to have to raise those two little kids now by himself."" CNN's Miguel Susana contributed to this report.","NEW: Victims are Guatemalan immigrants, friends say .

"Malibu, California (CNN) -- Many people are struggling just to provide the basics these days. The big question is, how do you find joy and fulfillment during lean holiday times like these? For the answer, I look back upon the philosophy by which my mother, Mieke Frankenberg, led her life, through both its brightest and darkest hours. Her philosophy originated during World War II through her experiences as a prisoner of war in a Japanese concentration camp in Indonesia. She had lived in that country with an abusive husband, whom she left before the war broke out and the Japanese captured her. Through the bleakest times, she reached out to her fellow prisoners to provide them with comfort and care. The lack of medical supplies meant care wasn't much more than holding someone's hand or sharing some of her starvation rations. While not a nurse, she gave of herself and drew a sustaining love in return. Returning to England after the war, my mother remarried and started a family, which grew to include me and my two sisters. With the camp behind her, my mother's philosophy remained to always keep an open heart. She volunteered with the Red Cross and regularly provided emotional support for friends. She found that when love flows with no boundaries from an open heart, love also finds its way back in. She gave and gave, and received love in return. This ""open heart"" philosophy has sustained me, as well, through the most difficult of times, including a painful divorce about 20 years ago that left me near penniless. At that point in my life, I attended a fundraiser for ChildHelp USA. I donated some of the last money I had, and in return, I secured a session where an artist drew a picture of my two children at the time. At that sitting, the artist saw potential in some finger paintings I'd made for my children and offered to give me free painting lessons. As I started painting, I discovered my emotional outlet. I began creating images of hearts that were always open, never closed. These hearts may have appeared unfinished in a way. But they brought me back to the lessons of my mother, a reminder to live as she lived -- openhearted. Soon, I changed from a frantic, terrified and angry person into someone who was able to let go of the past. I began to let other people into my life and to give back emotionally. Around that same time, I landed the TV role of ""Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman"" and was back on my feet. I now embody my mother's belief that only when you can love yourself and keep your heart open can you best give and receive love. My family continues my mother's tradition at Christmas, when we open our home to relatives, neighbors, my six children and even their friends -- extending our family to include those unable to head home for the holidays. Some years, there are as many as 50 people at the dinner table. Living with an open heart can be a path to rewarding holidays for many people this year, even if budgets tighten and troubles mount. The holiday table may be less bountiful. There may be fewer presents under the tree. But an open heart can bring a wealth of love, hope and inspiration. You might think these are shaping up to be your gloomiest holidays ever. But remember, as my mother taught me, someone is always worse off than you. Find a way to give, even if you're in need yourself. Find the place where you can provide comfort, care or love. Volunteer at a food bank or a shelter. Reach out to elderly neighbors to find out how you might make their lives a little easier. By opening your heart to others, good things will come to you, too. With that approach, I hope you'll find that 2009 could become the most fulfilling of holiday seasons. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jane Seymour.","Jane Seymour says her mother's spirit of openheartedness is instructive in lean holiday times .

"(CNN) -- In a little-known corner of southern England, more than 130 men are wrapping up in their winter warmers and drinking down their last whiskeys, as they prepare to do battle with their fiercest foes on the fairways. Their goal: a place in the fabled history of sporting rivalry between Oxford and Cambridge Universities. The ""President's Putter"" event takes place every January at Rye Golf Club between alumni of the two famous academic institutions. Competitors, whose ages can range from 18 to 85, travel from such far-off places as the U.S., South Africa and Asia in a quest to attach their winning ball to the fabled President's Putter -- a hickory-shafted instrument dating back to the inaugural event of 1920. David Normoyle flew in from Far Hills, New Jersey last week to see in the New Year with friends before heading down to Rye to take part in the event, which is scheduled to start on Friday. He is just hoping the heavy snowfall forecast for the rest of the week will not cause the competition to be called off for only the second time in its history. ""There's a great tradition of the event going forward in spite of the weather,"" says Normoyle, 31, who studied history at Cambridge. ""Last year, there was a hard frost and a very thick fog. There's something lovely about the warmth in the clubhouse at the end of the day when it's freezing cold outside. It really adds to the atmosphere of the whole thing."" While the competition is always intense -- many players have scratch or single-figure handicaps -- the matches are played in a jovial spirit and the motto of the event is ""serious fun."" The winner's medal carries the Latin inscription ""Primus inter pares,"" which is loosely translated by the Putter fraternity as ""he was lucky to win."" The competition takes place over four days, with a dinner held on the eve of the Sunday final, followed by a night out amid the cobbled streets of the medieval town of Rye. ""People push the boat out at both ends of the day,"" says David Bonsall, Treasurer of the Oxford and Cambridge Golfing Society, which organizes the event. ""There are often a few whiskey macs and bloody marys on the first tee to bury the memories of the night before."" Entry to the President's Putter is limited to golfing ""Blues,"" the term given to those who play for the Oxford or Cambridge teams at sport. January is the chosen month because if falls at a time when students and graduates are generally on vacation. In its early years, the Putter would be contested by some of the finest players of the day: four of Great Britain's 1926 Walker Cup side were Oxbridge graduates. The record for consecutive appearances is held by World War Two army parachutist Peter Gracey, who played in 57 Putters before finally hanging up his spikes in 2006 at the age 84. Other well-known competitors include the former England cricket captain Ted Dexter, who won the event twice in the 1980s. While the snow flakes continue to fall on the frosty fairways of the course, braver competitors have been out practicing their games. Others have been sharing stories in the warmth of the clubhouse bar as they wait to find out whether their annual pilgrimage has been worthwhile. ""It would be a huge disappointment if it didn't happen,"" says Normoyle. ""But we'll make do with whatever the decision is and we'll have fun whatever.""","Oxford and Cambridge alumni brave January weather for annual President's Putter competition .

"SWAT VALLEY, Pakistan (CNN) -- The boys shuffle into the room in a remote army base high in the mountains of Pakistan's Swat Valley. They are disheveled, disoriented. These boys say they were kidnapped by the Taliban and trained to be suicide bombers. There are no smiles, their eyes stare at the floor. These are the lost souls of Pakistan's battle with the Taliban. Each has a story of terror to tell, but the trauma runs so deep they can't even begin to properly find the words to describe what they have been through. That task is best left to the psychiatrist who, with her team, was brought in to try to pick through the pieces of this nightmare; to make sense of the brutality here and try to put broken lives back together.  Watch Stan Grant's report on the boys » . Dr. Fareeha Peracha describes these boys variously as ""psychotic,"" ""depressed,"" and in some cases, ""psychopathic."" ""They have been brainwashed. Brainwashed against people like you and me,"" she said. CNN was given limited access to about a dozen boys. They had all been kidnapped by the Taliban and taken to camps where they would be trained to kill; trained to be suicide bombers.  Watch Grant's exclusive interview with a wanted a Taliban leader » . CNN cannot reveal the boys' names; they have handkerchiefs tied across their faces to conceal their identities. The army fears they could face retribution should they be returned to their homes and families. The boys sit in a circle as I try to get them to open up about their ordeal. What happened? Were they brutalized? What did the Taliban ask them to do? So many questions. They answer hesitatingly, their voices barely a whisper. ""The first day they beat us and then made us exercise,"" one boy said. ""They made us run and told us you will wage jihad."" They said the Taliban especially poisoned their minds against the Pakistan army. ""They just told us that they (army) are against Islam, are against the Quran. They said wage jihad against them; we are waging jihad for the Quran,"" said another boy. They all say they were kidnapped by the Taliban, some snatched from fields and others from the towns they lived in. ""I was coming from the shop to my house, I had some stuff with me. They said, 'put your stuff in the car.' I helped them put stuff in the car. They asked if they should drop me in my village, but when we reached the village they blindfolded me and put a hand over my mouth,"" one boy said. The Taliban's tactics seem to have worked. I ask one boy, would he kill for God? He replied: ""Yes."" I asked the psychiatrist, Dr. Fareeha, if she believes the boys are capable of killing. ""Oh yes,"" she said. ""Two of them would not even give it a thought."" The army freed the boys during fierce fighting with the Taliban. Now they are hoping to rehabilitate the boys and one day return them home. But Fareeha thinks that is a long way off -- if ever. She told army chiefs the boys are unpredictable. One boy, she said, told her if he had a suicide bomber's jacket he would use it, that if he had a Kalashnikov, he would shoot. Of course, it is impossible to verify all of the accounts of the boys, but the doctors have no doubt about their trauma. Fareeha told Army chiefs that these boys were just a tip of the iceberg. After talking to the boys, she believes there are possibly hundreds of others just like them. These boys are the victims of the Taliban's uprising here. All they are left with are the terrible memories, the voices in their heads: the voices of the Taliban telling them to kill, they said.","Boys rescued from the Taliban in Pakistan are receiving psychiatric help .

"London, England (CNN) -- Authorities evacuated 310 people from their homes early Thursday because of a major fire at a building site and nearby apartments in south London, fire officials and police said. The London Fire Brigade said it was called to the scene at 4:26 a.m. (11:26 p.m. ET Wednesday), and police said they were called minutes later. Ten fire engines and around 75 firefighters were on the scene some eight hours later, a spokesman for the fire brigade said. The fire engulfed an entire building site in Peckham, an area of south London, and spread to several three- and four-story residential buildings in the area, police and fire officials said. Firefighters had the fire surrounded by noon and said there may still be deep-seated pockets of fire, a fire brigade spokesman said. Four people were taken to a hospital, mainly for smoke inhalation, a spokeswoman for the London Ambulance Service said. None of their conditions was serious, she said. ""I was in bed and my neighbor knocked and told me to wake up -- the building's on fire,"" said one woman wrapped in a coat on a nearby street.

"(CNN) -- American tourists heading to Mexico's Baja California state in the future can expect more police protection from a new task force, according to Mexican authorities. Mexican officials want to make sure the tourist traffic continues to flow into Tijuana. Officials from the Baja California cities of Tijuana, Ensenada and Rosarito gathered earlier this week to announce the creation of the task force, which will be made up of bilingual officers and which will be designed primarily to serve Americans. The initial plan, according to Ensenada Secretary of Public Safety Cesar Santiesteban, is to create a force that patrols a 50-mile tourist corridor from Tijuana through Las Playas Rosarito to Ensenada in Baja California, which is Mexico's northernmost and westernmost state. There were no immediate details as to when the task force would go into operation or how many officers would be in the unit. City officials in San Diego, California, said the city's police force would extend help in ways that Mexican officials deemed necessary in getting the task force up and running, including training the officers. ""We've always prided ourselves in our working relationship with our friends to the south,"" San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders, said. ""When you look at it, we're really one community."" For a region whose reputation has been tarnished by ongoing drug-fueled violence, plans for task force couldn't come soon enough. Policing the drug war has proven complicated for Mexican authorities, including the military, and also hindered the tourism industry in Mexico. American travelers, who represented 80 percent of the country's booming $13 billion travel industry last year, are a critical part of Mexico's economy. In 2008, more than 18 million Americans visited the country, according to the Mexico Tourism Board. In some areas, hotels and local businesses are struggling to recover from low visitor numbers, according to the Mexico Tourism Board. Tijuana Mayor Jorge Ramos said tourism in Baja California in the past two years has remained steady, and the task force was set up to create a stronger police presence for tourists. ""We're here on this side of the border to invite you to our city and to [show you] we're making a lot of things ... better, and to make some progress in our city,"" Ramos said in a news conference in San Diego Monday.","Task force will be made up of bilingual officers; primarily will serve Americans .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's mother fired the lawyers helping her fight for control of her son's estate, but her new lawyer missed a key hearing where the judge gave more power to the men she is opposing. Katherine Jackson, with Michael in 2005, is challenging the appointment of Michael's estate trustees. Katherine Jackson replaced lawyers Burt Levitch and Londell McMillan with Adam Streisand, a lawyer known for his expertise in Los Angeles probate cases. ""The family came to a decision before they called me,"" Streisand said. ""They felt they needed a different perspective and fresh look at how this case was being approached."" But Streisand arrived at court Thursday minutes after Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff ended a hearing in which he granted a request from estate special administrators John Branca and John McClain for more authority to make deals on behalf of Jackson's estate. ""I want this estate to move forward and I want these creditors to be dealt with,"" Beckloff said. ""And while we are proceeding in this posture, I want Mrs. Jackson to have information about what is going on and I don't want to be in court all the time."" The process of probate of Jackson's will, which named Branca and McClain as executors, has been slowed since soon after the pop star's June 25 death by numerous legal challenges filed by Katherine Jackson's lawyers, led by Levitch. Howard Weitzman, lead lawyer for the estate's administrators, expressed optimism that the two sides would be able to work better toward a settlement with Streisand in charge. The estate's administrators were able to make a series of deals expected to bring in at least $100 million to the estate this year, mostly through a documentary movie that premieres next week. Katherine Jackson's legal team has asked that a member of the Jackson family ""have a seat at the table"" as a third executor. They've also raised questions in sealed court papers about possible conflicts of interest that might prevent Branca and McClain from controlling the estate. Streisand said the Jackson family was frustrated with the inability ""to get this case going."" He indicated Katherine Jackson still planned to challenge Branca and McClain's control of her son's wealth. Under the 2002 will, Michael Jackson's three children and his mother are the chief beneficiaries of his estate, while unnamed charities will share in 20 percent of the wealth. Streisand said when he met with Katherine Jackson and the children to discuss the case, they were united. He said Jackson patriarch Joe Jackson was not present at the meeting and he's never talked with him. Joe Jackson appeared frustrated earlier this month when he attended his first hearing in the probate process, suggesting the lawyers should be more aggressive in court. Streisand said the three Jackson children are doing ""absolutely wonderful.""","Katherine Jackson hires probate lawyer Adam Streisand .

"(CNN) -- A 9-year-old girl was laid to rest Wednesday as a 15-year-old girl, described as an acquaintance, was in court on charges she carried out the younger girl's murder . Elizabeth Olten was coming home from a friend's house last week in St. Martins, Missouri, when she disappeared. Distraught residents searched for days for Olten without luck, when the Cole County Sheriff's Department received a tip that led them to the alleged killer. It didn't lead them to a stranger, a child predator or a convicted sex offender -- avenues police had originally considered because of Olten's age . Instead, it led them to a 15-year-old girl who, according to Peggy Florence, a family spokeswoman, had played with Olten. The girl then led police to the body -- which was found in an area authorities searched before, the sheriff's department said, but was hidden so well they hadn't seen it. Authorities said both physical evidence and some written evidence led to the suspect's arrest. She has been charged with first-degree murder. On Wednesday, Olten's family looked towards closure as two drastically different scenes unfolded in Missouri. Olten's family and friends watched as two white horses pulled her casket in a glass hearse. Hours earlier, a judge had ordered the 15-year-old suspect to be held while he decides whether she should be tried in adult court. Authorities have not released the suspect's name. Authorities released few details about the case, though they said an autopsy was conducted Saturday. The Olten family spent the day of Elizabeth's funeral remembering a very special little girl and mourning their loss, choosing to celebrate her life, instead of attending the court hearing of the teen accused of killing her. After the funeral ceremony, they released pink balloons, in honor of Elizabeth Olten's favorite color. For them, it was about their little girl -- the one who was always ready with a bright smile. ""She wanted to be a mother, she wanted to love others and take care of others,"" family spokeswoman Florence told HLN's Nancy Grace. ""She was just a lovely child -- she never met an animal she didn't love and dress up and play with."" She loved to dress up and put on fancy dresses, Florence said, even in the snow and the mud. ""She was a beautiful little girly girl,"" Florence said. ""She had everyone's heart.""","15-year-old suspect accused planning, carrying out murder of 9-year-old .

"(Editor's note: Marnie Gustavson is Executive Director of PARSA, a Seattle-based nonprofit working with widows, orphans and the disabled in Afghanistan. She spent her teenage years in Kabul, where she now lives with her family. For more information about PARSA, read here and here . Marnie Gustavson says the real Afghanistan is more textured  than could be seen from secure bunkers. KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- In my Afghanistan, the days are compiled images of Afghans living their simple lives. My Afghanistan is a kaleidoscope of real people, from the stick-thin bearded Paghmani man, an imposing 6-foot-5, rhythmically lifting rocks, 12 hours a day, seven days a week for $4 a day, his shalwar kameez billowing in the hot summer breezes; to the grin of the boy in his blue shirt as he labors to cut the alfalfa after school to feed the flock of big-bottomed sheep. To the kiss of the old widow, her family gone, whose feet hurt incessantly; she's forgotten the English she once knew when she worked for the government. And of course, to the communities my organization works with to help them better their lives through direct education and training programs. A Pashtun orphan, about 11, enters my office with a plate of freshly picked summer apricots. He was rescued from a madrassa that trained him how to throw grenades and to be a suicide bomber. He spends time with me when he gets a chance, tidying my desk, pulling my papers out of the copier and stacking them. We can't speak much as I do not know Pashtun and he hasn't yet learned Dari or English, but he tucks his head into the crook of my neck for a couple of minutes watching me type. In these gentle moments, he begins to unwind and I experience the fragile connection that is being created between our worlds. Living and working in Afghanistan for nearly five years now, I do not recognize most of what the international news accounts of this area report as anything remotely close to my experience. A visiting journalist recently observed with some surprise that ""parts of Afghanistan are at war and parts are peaceful."" Indeed, like Ireland and many other sites of civil unrest in the world, there are pockets of peace and pockets of war. The things that concern me most as I go about my day-to-day activities are not suicide bombers, kidnappings, and the ""insurgency."" These are all just a backdrop to the much more textured story that is Afghanistan, though it rarely touches the lives of the 2,500 or so foreign aid workers who live and work in Kabul. Yet these stories of violence dominate the news outside and thus color the way the world imagines Afghanistan. Internationals living in the country are constantly bombarded with ""threat alerts"" and rarely visit the desperately poor Afghan communities their projects are ostensibly attempting to help. This is what concerns me: how my country is spending development dollars here without really being here. The results of the fear that dominates the management of most development projects are an incompletely informed group of international professionals working in Afghanistan who can literally spend years here without seeing the country but through the windows of their armored cars. Living as they do under cloistered, fearful conditions behind razor-wired walls, venturing out only to a select list of ""secure"" locations, they make often questionable decisions on spending, frequently without the input of Afghan nationals. From this entrenched, isolated position, they are managing hundreds of millions of dollars of international development funds. When news reports talk about Afghanistan's high levels of corruption, they do not lift the veils to see that the development projects themselves are actually enabling it with security conditions that resemble apartheid. While folks at home are hunkering down, Afghanistan projects are concerned with tripling their monthly ""burn rates"" and managing projects remotely -- projects that almost certainly are less than the books indicate, or worse, have been paid for several times over by different organizations. It is time for those controlling the funding investment in this country to listen to their citizens, especially Afghan-Americans and other Americans like me and my family who live and work here. We are the people on the front lines, and connected as we are to the community here, we have much to offer in the way of supporting the success of the donor efforts. The good news is that there are more than a few Americans in this country who have the privilege of experiencing the Afghan people the way I do. But so far, my attempts to connect them with the American mission here as the new administration ""rethinks"" the strategy for Afghanistan have been unsuccessful as calls and e-mails to the ambassador have gone unanswered. There is a story of a young American worker for a nongovernmental organization who stopped on the road recently to pull out a van that was stuck in the snow, having veered into the oncoming lane when the sun was going down. In the car were two women, three small children and an elderly man, plus the two men who were attempting to dig out the wheels with sticks. It took less than 10 minutes to pull them out, and they were grateful for the help... they'd been there for nearly four hours and many trucks and security vehicles had passed them without offering a helping hand. They thought they would either freeze or be pushed over the brink of the cliff once it darkened. I know that story is true because the young man is my son Reese and I was with him. I propose a simple and very Afghan solution to the Afghanistan dilemma: We need to be good neighbors. Offer help. Be visible. Take some risks to communicate with ordinary people. My young Pashtun orphan, trained to kill, is now growing up in an institution where he mixes with internationals, with the very ""infidels"" he was previously conditioned to hate. ... Are these not the ways for us to build bridges into this community? With shared meals instead of divisive policies? These are not new thoughts, but they are often unspoken and certainly not practiced in America's Afghanistan, which is a world divided by sandbags, concrete T-beams and armed guards.

"(CNN) -- A small town in Maryland is setting a precedent in eco-friendly road construction, breaking ground this week on one of the greenest streets in the nation. The tiny port town of Edmonston in Prince George's County is billing the thoroughfare as the greenest on the East Coast. The road will help clean and filter toxic storm water pollution that drains into rivers, and eventually into Chesapeake Bay. ""What we're hoping to do, from top to bottom, is build a street that is completely environmentally sustainable, "" said Edmonston Mayor Adam Ortiz. Ortiz says the blueprint incorporates native tree cover to cool off the streets, wind-powered street lights that use high-efficiency LED bulbs, and pedestrian and bicycle access . But most important, says Ortiz, is the plan for all that water that rolls down the streets when it rains. ""[It's] not going to be flushed into our local rivers. Instead it's going to be naturally filtered. And that's very important for us to save our rivers and to help save the Chesapeake Bay here in Maryland."" Storm water runoff often carries toxins and pollution from parking lots and city streets, and from farms and agricultural lands in rural areas. Most cities and towns have underground concrete drain systems that collect the runoff and dump it into rivers and streams, pollutants and all. ""What we're going to do, instead, is divert that water into natural gardens. To the naked eye it just looks like a regular garden, but actually it's very specially engineered to absorb a lot of water and naturally filter it before it gets into the water table, and to keep it from washing all those pollutants into the river,"" according to Ortiz. The storm water runoff in Edmonston drains into the nearby Anacostia River, which feeds into the Washington Channel, then empties into the Potomac River and eventually Chesapeake Bay. The eco-street project includes using porous bricks in building the road and creating bioretention cells or rain gardens. The idea is to trap the polluted runoff water, sending it through natural filter systems so that when it makes it into the Anacostia, it's a lot cleaner. Maryland Department of the Environment Deputy Secretary Robert Summers hopes this new main street in Edmonston is just the first of many. ""This kind of green infrastructure project to reduce storm water and energy consumption is exactly the kind of thing we need to do around the bay watershed to reduce pollution."" Summers says the benefits of this project are twofold: a reduction in storm water pollution and, through the energy efficiency in powering lighting, a reduction in air pollution and fallout. But how much can converting one street really help in cleaning up an area the size of the Chesapeake Bay? Summers acknowledges this is just the beginning. ""We need to grow it by leaps and bounds."" The Edmonston green street project is funded by the Environmental Protection Agency through a $1.1 million Recovery Act grant. Summers says the state of Maryland has already allocated $20 million for other green projects and that this is the first of many projects. The District of Columbia, Virginia, and Pennsylvania are also reviewing this green technology to eventually help do their part to clean up Chesapeake Bay. And in the Northwest, Seattle, Washington, and Portland, Oregon, have already taken steps to clean and control polluted storm water runoff. ""Our goal is that other towns and cities and communities will steal our ideas,"" Edmonston Mayor Ortiz said. ""We'll know we're successful when we see these technologies used in other places.""","New road will help clean storm water pollution that drains into rivers, Chesapeake Bay .

"(CNN) -- For many graduate students seeking an advanced education degree, obstacles abound. Issues of finance, time management and family logistics often get in the way of students furthering their education and their dreams. Palestinian Sawsan Salameh is attending an Israeli university after years of negotiations and court proceedings. For Sawsan Salameh, the obstacles also involved politics. Several years ago, Salameh, a 31-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank village of Anata, was granted a scholarship to study at Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Although her town is only a few miles from the university, access to the school was out of reach because of an Israeli military ban that limited Palestinian students' access to Israeli universities, on security grounds. But she was far from giving up on her goal of pursuing her education. ""When I was in high school, it was a dream that I should finish my Ph.D.,"" Salameh said. After obtaining a master's degree at Al Quds University, a Palestinian school in the West Bank, Salameh was granted full scholarships at several international schools, including Hebrew University. With the military ban in place, Salameh considered studying at a university abroad. ""I started to think I should get up and take this offer to leave, but it's not easy to go abroad, and the only chance is for me to study in Israel, because it's important for me to stay close to my family,"" Salameh said. Salameh sought the support of the Israeli human rights organization Gisha, which submitted a petition to Israel's Supreme Court on her behalf in 2006. The Supreme Court responded by asking the military to lift the ban and allow Salameh to study at Hebrew University, where she is pursuing a Ph.D. in pharmacology. ""We argued Sawsan's case for 2½ years, and at the end of the day, the military agreed to let Sawsan study,"" said Sari Bashi, director of Gisha. ""It was impossible to deny her incredible talents and the example she set for women and girls throughout the West Bank,"" Bashi says. The Israeli military agreed to review all future requests for Palestinians in the West Bank wishing to pursue a degree at an Israeli university on a case-by-case basis, based on specific criteria. The criteria include that the potential student clear all necessary internal security checks, that the student pursue a degree in a discipline that would encourage regional cooperation and develop area coexistence, and that the area of study not have the potential to cause damage to Israel, says Maj. Guy Inbar, spokesman for the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories. The area of study must be supported by an international organization (such as the U.N. or the Red Cross) and approved by the Ministry of Education and must also be a degree unique to an Israeli university (not offered at a Palestinian university). The request must come with a recommendation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to Inbar. After Salameh's victory, Gisha, with the support of a number of Israeli academics, further appealed to the court to push the military to ease these limitations. The Israeli military's heightened security concerns reflect heightened tensions in the region due to the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli conflict. In July 2002, a bomb exploded in the student cafeteria of Hebrew University, killing seven people. The Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas claimed responsibility for the explosion, according to Palestinian sources. Still, some academics at Hebrew University believe qualified students like Salameh pose no security risk, and their acceptance to Israeli universities could even foster better relations in the region. Professor Alon Harel, a law professor at Hebrew University, pushed for the appeal to lift the military's criteria on Palestinian students. He believes that the admission of Palestinian students from the West Bank would enrich the academic environment at the university, particularly in the study of law. ""It's particularly important for classes to be diverse, for people to have familiarity with Arabic studies and Islamic law,"" he said. Other academics agree that qualified students such as Salameh can only add to the diversity of the campus, where thousands of Israeli Arab students are enrolled. ""My personal feeling is that we should do everything we can to allow Palestinian students to study at Hebrew University,"" said Yaacov Schul, vice rector at Hebrew University. Salameh is a devout Muslim with a traditional background yet shirks pressure from family members to focus on marriage and motherhood. ""Everyday I have to hear something about [not being married] from relatives and aunts,"" she says. ""It's become [the] usual."" Salameh, who also provides valuable resources for young women at a women's center she opened in her community, says she hopes her pursuit of higher education will open even more doors for young women also wishing to pursue a higher education and achieve their academic goals. ""I get lots of phone calls every day from girls in the West Bank who ask me how to apply to universities in Israel,"" Salameh said. ""Maybe they can become more than just a wife and mother and at least finish their first degree,"" she said. Salameh says she enjoys the collegial atmosphere at Hebrew University, where she studies among Israeli Arab, international and Israeli students. She is considering pursuing another degree after completing her Ph.D. in two years. ""I would like to help other people, and I hope the political situation will become better and things will become easier,"" she said.","Palestinian Sawsan Salameh faced many obstacles before attending Israeli school .
She hopes she can open doors for other students to study where they want .
She also has become a role model for girls in the West Bank to pursue education ."
"Chatham Borough, New Jersey (CNN)  -- The janitor charged in the slaying of a priest answered a call from a 911 operator and said, ""Everything's fine,"" according to police. Jose Feliciano stabbed the Rev. Ed Hinds 32 times with a knife after the two got into an argument on Thursday, Morris County Prosecutor Robert Bianchi said. The Roman Catholic priest's body was found in the rectory of at St. Patrick's Church on Friday morning. Feliciano, 64, has been employed with the church for 17 years, Bianchi said. Feliciano also faces two weapons charges, Bianchi said at a news conference. It was not immediately known whether the janitor had retained legal counsel. When the janitor was interviewed Saturday, after waiving his Miranda rights, he ""confessed to the murder of Father Hinds,"" an arrest affidavit said. The priest's body was discovered Friday morning in the rectory kitchen by Feliciano and others, according to the affidavit. An autopsy had concluded that Hinds died of ""multiple sharp force injuries."" Hinds had stab wounds to his upper torso and the back of his head, Bianchi said. The priest also had defensive wounds on his hands and contusions and bruises to his face, he said. Hinds called 911 from his cell phone at 5:11 p.m. Thursday, saying he was being attacked and asking for help, Bianchi said. The call was cut off and the 911 operator called back, Bianchi said. He said Feliciano answered the phone. The operator couldn't send authorities because the calls were made from a cell phone and could not be traced, Bianchi said. Feliciano ""made a half-hearted attempt to do CPR in front of police. They said it was bizarre. He made about two or three compressions and said something like, 'he's dead,'"" Bianchi told CNN. The affidavit said authorities discovered that Hinds' cell phone had been used in Easton, Pennsylvania, about 40 miles west of Chatham. Further investigation led them to a garbage can in a park there, where a T-shirt and rags ""saturated with what appeared to be blood"" were found, the affidavit said. The garbage can was about 50 yards from Feliciano's home, it said. Feliciano told police that he entered the rectory around 5 p.m. Thursday, where he and the priest argued, the affidavit said. The two men got into an argument ""over Feliciano's continued employment,"" Bianchi told CNN. He said Feliciano ""beat him up first, there was also bruising on his face,"" said the prosecutor. Feliciano left Hinds on the kitchen floor and went into the church to get a kitchen ""steak or paring"" knife, and returned and stabbed the priest, the prosecutor said. After the slaying, Feliciano said he cleaned up the blood with rags and paper towels and put them in a black bag, which he put in the trash can, the affidavit said. Feliciano also said he threw away the knife after returning home and destroyed Hinds' cell phone. Bianchi said the suspected weapon was found in a field near Feliciano's home. Hinds also oversaw the church's Catholic grade school. ""When you're the sole pastor and you do most of the baptisms and weddings and funerals, people end up loving you. This will be a big loss for the parish and a big loss for the diocese,"" said the Rev. Paul Manning from the Archdiocese of Paterson, New Jersey. CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","Victim called 911, said he was being attacked before call cut off, prosecutor says .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- He says it's true. She says it's not. Former New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey and his wife, Dina Matos McGreevey, in 2004. Former New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey says he and his wife, Dina Matos McGreevey, used to engage in sexual relations with his ex-aide and driver, Teddy Pedersen. Dina Matos McGreevey has denied the allegation. The New York Post and New Jersey's Star Ledger reported online Sunday that Pedersen said he had sexual relations with the McGreeveys in the late 1990s during the couple's courtship, and after the McGreeveys' marriage in 2000. In the article, Pedersen describes trysts during which he and Jim McGreevey would both have sex with Dina Matos McGreevey, but says that, in his opinion, ""me being part of their sexual relationship enhanced it for both of them."" Pedersen described regularly sharing a hotel room with the McGreeveys during out-of-town business trips. In a statement issued Monday, Dina Matos McGreevey acknowledged that Pedersen had long had a ""close relationship"" with her former husband, but called his sexual claims ""completely false."" ""This all has to do with the publicity I have received since [New York] Gov.

""Jim has enlisted one of his cronies in trying to distinguish that situation from his own, and to discredit me in the media,"" she said.

""This happened, this happened in the past, and now, we need to move on with our lives,"" the former governor said in a written statement. ""For all our sakes, particularly our daughter, we need to close this chapter and look toward the future."" The statement went on to say he had removed references to the incidents Pedersen describes from an early draft of his book. ""I still hope Dina and I can resolve our issues privately,"" it concluded.

"(CNN) -- Israel may have to retire its title as the only democracy in the Middle East. With Sunday's free and fair national election, Iraq joins the honor roll as one of the very few Islamic democracies. Other Middle Eastern countries hold elections too, of course. But those elections fall into two broad categories. The first category is the blatantly rigged: Iran, most spectacularly, but also Algeria, Egypt, and Yemen, among others. In the second category, elections are more or less honest -- but fail to exert much control over the actions of the government: Lebanon, Morocco, and Jordan. In Iraq, despite violence, votes are honestly counted. Once counted, votes decide who rules. For all the country's well-known problems, that record is a remarkable achievement. The brave Iraqi democrat Nibras Kazimi posted this firsthand account on his important blog, Talisman Gate: . ""I voted. It felt great, but the greatest thing about it was how normal it felt; elections have become a ho-hum, commonplace occurrence. That's quite a feat for a country with Iraq's past and current challenges. The voting procedure itself was very well organized and speedy. The election site had seven polling stations, with about 400 registered voters allowed to vote there. Everyone's name was posted outside, along with information about what polling station they were supposed to use. Once inside, IDs were checked against name lists, and one had to sign next [to] one's name to indicate that this name has voted. All in all, there are reasonable mechanisms in place to contain incidents of fraud. ... ""The Western media is hyperventilating about mortars and katyushas. ... This was a logistical failure for the jihadists; hardly any successful suicide bombers or sniper attacks near the polling stations. Lobbing mortars indiscriminately around Baghdad is BS intimidation. It certainly didn't deter voters. ""The fact that the security authorities allowed vehicular traffic around 11 AM was both surprising and bold. It showed confidence in their security precautions, and the fact that there were no car bombs shows that they were right."" Iraq's elected government has consolidated power over the whole country, including the formerly Iranian-run southern city of Basra. It has presided over a remarkable decline in violence. The Brookings Institute's Iraq index estimates that there were 34,500 Iraqi civilian casualties in 2006. In 2009, 2,800 Iraqi civilians died violently. Attacks on coalition forces have dwindled from almost 2,000 per week at the end of 2006 to a little over 100 per week. Iraq is not yet a stable place -- but a future of stability seems at last at hand. Maybe the surest sign of success is that those who once opposed the surge are now scrambling to grab credit for it. Iraq ""could be one of the great achievements of this administration,"" boasted Vice President Joe Biden to CNN's Larry King last month. Next we'll hear how we owe the Marshall Plan and the Panama Canal to the Obama administration. Well, that's not how those who were there remember it. A stable Western-oriented Iraq at peace with itself and its neighbors would be a great prize. If that future does take hold, we'll learn the answer to another great question. Speaking on the eve of war in 2003, President George W. Bush told the guests at the American Enterprise Institute's annual dinner that he discerned ""hopeful signs of a desire for freedom in the Middle East. Arab intellectuals have called on Arab governments to address the 'freedom gap' so their peoples can fully share in the progress of our times. ""Leaders in the region speak of a new Arab charter that champions internal reform, greater politics participation, economic openness, and free trade. And from Morocco to Bahrain and beyond, nations are taking genuine steps toward politics reform. A new regime in Iraq would serve as a dramatic and inspiring example of freedom for other nations in the region."" Will he be vindicated? In the January issue of the Journal of Democracy, Larry Diamond offers grounds for hope that the answer may be yes. Diamond, an expert on democracy-building who served with the Coalition Provisional Authority, itemizes the indicators of growing yearning for self-rule in the Middle East. He notes surveys in which 80 percent of Arabs across the region agree that democracy is the best form of government and would be good for their own country. Of all the obstacles to Arab democracy -- religion, culture, geopolitics -- the most important is geological: oil. Oil states tend to be undemocratic states, because control of the state so directly translates into control of the nation's wealth. When the price of oil rises, the value of power rises with it. It's not a coincidence that oil states from Russia to Venezuela to Iran have turned to more repressive and hard-line policies since the price of oil began to rise in 2001. By contrast, the 1986 collapse in the price of oil is widely cited as a decisive factor in the collapse of the Soviet Union. Iraq's future will depend on its success overcoming ""the curse of oil."" America's next contribution to Middle Eastern democracy may be an energy policy that finally lifts this curse. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","Iraq held a free and fair election for parliament on Sunday, says David Frum .

"Napa Valley, California (CNN) -- It is the quintessential Napa Valley experience. Passengers aboard sleek antique rail cars pay more than $100 for a four-course meal, not including the wine. A recent lunch aboard the train included steak, lobster cakes and local greens. During their three-hour journey winding through Napa Valley, passengers can choose from more than 100 wines to complement their meal. The Napa Valley Wine Train has been shuttling passengers through one of the country's most famous valleys for more than two decades, but now it's under fire because of Republican Sens. Tom Coburn and John McCain. They ranked the wine train as No. 11 on their list of the 100 most ""wasteful"" and ""silly"" stimulus projects, leading some to call it the Stimulus Waste Express. When Melodie Hilton, who handles public relations for the wine train, learned about that nickname, she was less than pleased. Hilton said the report temporarily affected business. She said through a smile, ""it's never fun to wake up and find that you're an object of national scorn."" But CNN found that scorn undeserved. In fact, CNN confirmed that not a single stimulus dollar is being spent on the wine train itself. The stimulus money is really being used for a massive flood-control project for the valley. The train's tracks happen to be in the way, so they have to be moved. It is a simple fix, but it's not cheap.   To make it happen, $54 million is being used to build a flood wall at the wine train depot, elevate the tracks and move them 33 feet, and raise four bridges. How did the wine train end up on the list of wasteful projects? ""The person who did the research for the senators didn't do a thorough job,"" Hilton said, ""and I think if they did a thorough job, we wouldn't have been on the list at all."" Barry Martin is the spokesman for the Napa River Flood Control Project. He called the senators' report ""deliberate deception"" and a way to score ""political points."" Martin says this is not a ""frivolous project"" or a waste of stimulus dollars. ""This is perfectly fitting into what stimulus is intended to do. People are on the job working today who might not be otherwise,"" Martin said.   Coburn's spokesman said the whole project is a ""misplaced priority."" He also criticized it for being a ""no-bid"" project, meaning only one contractor was considered.  Just how many people are employed on the project is ambiguous. Martin says that at least 600 jobs have been created for the whole thing. And those people, he says, will stay on the job two to three years. The Army Corps of Engineers, which is overseeing the flood control initiative, said that every $1 million spent creates about 20 jobs but said it didn't have an exact figure of jobs for the project. And the contractor, Suulutaaq, had reported just 12 jobs created to the White House. A spokeswoman said the company expects that 200 people will be employed over the life of the project. Regardless, the goal is to prevent Napa from flooding every few years, as it does now. In 1986, a flood cost the city $100 million. In 2005, flood damage hit $115 million. Hilton, who has lived through the floods in Napa Valley and recalls neighborhoods under feet of water, wrote a letter to McCain: ""Since you have thrown down the gauntlet, and made accusations, I would like to demand satisfaction! ... Talk to the officials behind this project; learn what is really going on. It is your right and your responsibility."" ""We all have the same goal,"" she later said. ""Nobody appreciates waste. If he came out and explored this, I don't think this would have been on the list."" CNN's Susan Chun contributed to this report.","U.S. senators claimed Wine Train received stimulus money .

"Santiago, Chile (CNN) -- Aid poured in for Chile from home and overseas, with a local television station hoping to raise $27 million by Saturday and the United Nations pledging funds toward recovery efforts after a massive earthquake. ""Chile Helps Chile,"" a telethon that started Friday, runs until Saturday night, according to TV Chile's Web site. The site includes phone numbers and and e-mails for making donations in nearly 20 countries outside the South American nation. Hundreds of people died when the 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck Chile last Saturday. The world's fifth-strongest earthquake since 1900 resulted in a tsunami that toppled buildings, particularly in the Maule region along the coast. It's still unclear exactly how many people died. Army divers have been searching the waters near the city of Constitucion for the bodies of as many as 400 tourists who were camping on an island during a summer festival. ""There were horrible screams. People calling out for us to go and rescue them. They were crying for help. But there was nothing we could do,"" local fisherman Agustin Diaz said.

""At the same time I am very grateful, very moved by such a strong determination,"" he added. ""The leaders, the people on the ground, they are all united."" Ban also announced Friday a team effort between U.N. agencies and the Chilean government to determine the priority areas for funds, with emphasis on health, shelters, education and water.

Friday's aftershocks did not cause any known injuries or damage and no tsunami warnings were issued.

The new tally does not account for hundreds of unidentified victims. ""It takes months sometimes to compile the information, because one of the biggest problems in the affected areas is the lack of precision and uncertainty at the scene,"" Rosende said.

"(CNN) -- A U.S.-flagged ship that played a central role in a bloody hijacking drama last spring was attacked again Wednesday, a busy day for piracy in the dangerous waters off the east coast of Africa. It was the first time a security team aboard a major merchant ship repelled a pirate attack, a top U.S. Navy officer said. But a defensive weapon that emits a loud noise did not work, Vice Adm. Bill Gortney said in a briefing. ""They tried to employ [a long-range acoustical device] and it did not have the effect,"" said Gortney, the commander of U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, which is responsible for the area favored by pirates. He said he did not know why the device did not work. The Maersk Alabama came under automatic weapons fire from pirates about 350 nautical miles east of the Somali coast, the European Union's anti-piracy force said, but fought the attackers off. The failed attack came on a day of dramatic piracy events: The captain of a ship hijacked Monday was confirmed to have died, even as his ship was used to attack another, and a Spanish prosecutor demanded an investigation into reports that a ransom had been paid for a ship released Tuesday. The failed attack Wednesday targeted the same ship that was hijacked in the Indian Ocean in April. Its captain, Richard Phillips, was held hostage on a lifeboat for five days before U.S. Navy snipers shot three pirates dead. A fourth pirate was arrested, and Phillips was rescued. This time, private security guards on the Danish-owned ship fended off the pirates, EU and U.S. naval sources said. Security had been beefed up on the vessel since the attack in April, Maersk spokesman Kevin Speers told CNN. The ship's owners did not immediately respond to a CNN question about whether Phillips is still captain of the ship. Somali pirates vowed revenge for the killing of their compatriots by the U.S. Navy in April, but it was not immediately clear if the Maersk Alabama was targeted intentionally or if the latest attack was a coincidence. No casualties were reported on the ship, but pirates on land in Somalia feared the pirates who attacked the Maersk Alabama may have been killed or wounded, or may have drowned, they told a local journalist. There has been no contact with them since they attacked the Maersk Alabama, a pirate in the central Somali town of Harardhere said. Their last communication came while they were battling the security guards on the cargo ship, the pirate said. Pirates on land also exchanged gunfire -- with one another. They fought among themselves Wednesday over a multimillion-dollar ransom they received for releasing a Spanish fishing boat, said a local journalist in contact with the pirates. ""There was a heavy exchange of gunfire between some of our friends"" one pirate told the journalist, speaking of the other pirates. ""They fought over the 3 million euro ($4.5 million) received as a ransom from the Spanish boat."" At least two pirates were wounded in the gunfight in Harardhere, a pirate stronghold in central Somalia, the local journalist told CNN. Those two pirates are in critical condition and have been transferred to the town of Galka'yo. The Alakrana, the Spanish fishing vessel, was freed Tuesday along with its 36 crew members, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said. It had been held for 47 days. Zapatero did not say how the ship was freed. Spanish media -- including CNN sister station CNN+, which cited a source it said was close to the negotiations -- reported that a ransom had been paid. A top prosecutor in Madrid on Wednesday called for an investigation into the reported ransom. National Court prosecutor Jesus Alonso sent a written request for the ransom investigation to Judge Santiago Pedraz, asking that the financial web involved in the alleged payment be untangled, including commissions paid to intermediaries in the negotiations, CNN+ reported from the courthouse. The prosecutor also called on the judge to take testimony from all the ship's 36 crew members. Various government ministers have sidestepped questions about whether a ransom was paid, but Spanish media reported the payment to the pirates totaled $3.5 million to $4 million. A leading Spanish fishing industry executive, Juan Manuel Vieites, told CNN on Wednesday that he was certain a ransom was paid for the release of the Spanish tuna trawler. But Vieites, who heads Euroatun -- a pan-European tuna fishing industry group -- and a Spanish tuna canning association, said he wasn't sure about the amount of the ransom. He declined to provide details. A day after the hijacking, Spanish military monitoring the situation captured two pirate suspects as they left the fishing boat and later brought them to Madrid. The two were indicted Monday on 36 counts of kidnapping and armed robbery. They could face sentences of more than 200 years in prison each because of the multiple kidnapping counts. Separately, the captain of a chemical tanker seized earlier this week died of a wound inflicted during the hijacking, a pirate said. The ship, the MV Theresa VIII, was used to attack another ship off the Somali coast, the pirate said, but did not provide any other details. The Virgin Islands-flagged vessel, with a crew of 28 North Koreans and operated from Singapore, was seized in the Indian Ocean on Monday, according to the EU naval force. It was heading for Mombasa, Kenya, but was hijacked in the south Somali Basin, about 180 miles northwest of the Seychelles, the EU statement said. Pirates have captured more than 50 ships this year off Somalia.

"(CNN) -- An arrest warrant has been issued for a Florida man suspected in the shooting deaths of four people, including his sisters, in the coastal town of Jupiter, authorities said Saturday. Paul Michael Merhige, 35, allegedly left the scene of the Thanksgiving Day shooting armed. He faces four counts of first-degree murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder, the Palm Beach County State Attorney's Office said in a statement. The U.S. Marshals have joined the search for Merhige, and a $10,000 reward was offered for information leading to his arrest. The shooting victims include Merhige's 6-year-old cousin, Makayla Sitton; his 33-year-old twin sisters, Carla Merhige and Lisa Knight; and 76-year-old Raymond Joseph, police said. One of the victims -- Knight -- was pregnant, a police spokeswoman said Friday. Two others -- Patrick Knight and Clifford Gebara -- were wounded, police said. Interviews with family members suggest that Merhige ""had ongoing resentment"" for some of his relatives, said Sally Collins-Ortiz, a spokeswoman for Jupiter police. The shooting occurred about 10 p.m. Thursday. Merhige is thought to have escaped in a blue 2007 Toyota Camry with Florida license plate number W42 7JT, police said.","Paul Michael Merhige faces four counts of first-degree murder, two counts of attempted murder .

"(CNN) -- At least five homes were destroyed after a tornado touched down in western Oklahoma Monday evening, authorities said. There were no reports of injuries. Other homes were damaged, and power was out to about 900 residences in and around the city of Hammon in Roger Mills County, Oklahoma, Michelann Ooten of the Department of Emergency Management said. Roger Mills officials continued to assess the damage, but all residents appear to be accounted for, Ooten said. The tornado hit about 5:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. ET), said Ken Gallant, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Norman, Oklahoma. The thunderstorms that produced the conditions for the tornado weakened shortly afterward and a tornado warning was canceled, Gallant said. Jerry Dean, county commissioner of Roger Mills, said the county barn was among the structures destroyed. Area residents had time to prepare before the tornado hit, Dean said. He could see the tornado coming before going into a cellar to wait it out, he said.","At least five homes were destroyed after the tornado touched down .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- The two men running Michael Jackson's estate gained new powers and an extension of their authority until the end of the year in a court hearing Friday. An investigator's report said Michael Jackson's children are doing well with Katherine Jackson as their guardian. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff also accepted an investigator's report that said Jackson's three children are adjusting well under the guardianship of Katherine Jackson. ""It looks like the children are really doing wonderfully with their grandmother guardian,"" Beckloff said. Joe Jackson sat in the courtroom for the hearing on estate and custody matters. It was the first time Michael Jackson's father has attended the hearings since his son's June 25 death. John Branca and John McClain, named as executors of Jackson's 2002 will, have been handling the estate's business as temporary special administrators since July while the will probate process is completed. Branca was a longtime attorney for Michael Jackson, who was rehired by the pop star just a week before his death, according to estate lawyer Howard Weitzman. McClain is a former music industry executive who worked with Jackson for years. Katherine Jackson's challenge of Branca and McClain appears headed for a trial in December, unless an agreement is reached between them. Her lawyers have not publicly given their objections to the two men, but have suggested the trial would explore possible conflicts of interest that would prevent them from running the estate. Jackson's lawyers have also said a Jackson family member should be included as an executor. While Joe Jackson did not speak to reporters after the hearing, a Jackson family friend, Majestik Magnificent, talked about the special administrators. ""Why are they even here? Why are they even involved in this? This is a family affair,"" he said. Until now, the administrators had to ask for court approval for every agreement they made for the estate, including a deal for a movie that will hit theaters at the end of October. ""Things went well for the estate, because the estate can now continue to do it's business,"" Weitzman said after the hearing. Beckloff said that while the case is fascinating, his calendar is too full for him to be involved in all of the estate's business. With their new powers, the special administrators only have to notify the court and the Jacksons about deals. Michael Jackson's mother and three children, along with unnamed charities, are the beneficiaries of the estate, which is estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. An odd moment came in the hearing when a woman who has previously filed a papers claiming to be the mother of Michael Jackson's youngest child, Prince Michael II, spoke up to remind the judge she was there. She says her name is Billie Jean Jackson. At the end of the hearing, Joe Jackson approached her, but she frowned at him and walked away. Majestik Magnificent later wondered aloud why reporters even give any attention to ""crazy"" people surrounding the case.","Judge extends Michael Jackson administrators' powers until the end of the year .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- After more than a month in a Haitian jail, an American missionary was free Monday night, looking forward to a hot shower and a long night in bed on home soil. But Charisa Coulter's heart remains in Haiti, her father said, because her best friend, Laura Silsby is now alone behind bars. ""She came back with mixed emotions,"" Mel Coulter told CNN affiliate WSVN in Miami, Florida. Haitian Judge Bernard Saint-Vil released Coulter on Friday. She walked out of judicial police headquarters in Port-au-Prince and headed to the nearby airport for a flight to Miami. Coulter is staying in a hotel by herself, her father said. He did not know when she might return home to Boise, Idaho. He said his daughter had been through a ""trying experience"" and was welcoming the solitude. Coulter, Silsby and eight other Americans had been detained in Haiti on suspicion of kidnapping 33 children after the killer earthquake January 12. Last month, Saint-Vil released the eight others, but Silsby and Coulter remained in custody because the judge wanted to learn more about their motives. On Friday, Silsby was brought into Saint-Vil's office for further questioning. The missionaries were stopped by Haitian authorities on January 29 as they tried to cross the border with 33 children without proper legal documentation. The group said it was going to house the children in a converted hotel in the Dominican Republic and later move them to an orphanage. Saint-Vil recently traveled to the Dominican Republic to see where Silsby said she intended to open an orphanage. Silsby originally claimed the children were orphaned or abandoned, but CNN determined that more than 20 of them had at least one living parent. Some parents said they placed their children in Silsby's care because that was the only way they knew to ensure a better quality of life for them. The 10 Americans, many of whom belong to a Baptist church in Idaho, have said they were trying to help the children get to a safe place after the 7.0-magnitude earthquake flattened cities and towns in Haiti. Silsby said she was ""very happy that Charisa went home today."" She expected her freedom would soon follow. ""I came here to help these children,"" she said. CNN's Lonzo Cook and Sara Sidner contributed to this report.","NEW: Last group member in custody says she expects to be released soon .

"Willow, Alaska (CNN) -- The 2010 Iditarod is officially under way, with 71 mushers and dog teams on the wide-open trail toward Nome. Teams will spend the next week and a half crossing 1,049 miles through some of the most demanding and formidable conditions on Earth, including North America's largest mountain chain, the Alaska range. ""Ten days and nothing else but eat, sleep and feed dogs,"" Canadian musher Sebastian Schnuelle said excitedly. The sport has been dominated in recent years by Lance Mackey, 39, of Fairbanks, Alaska, and this year he will be trying to accomplish what no musher in history has been able to do: win four consecutive Iditarods. Mackey is a throat cancer survivor and is known for his fierce determination and competitive spirit. He comes from family of Alaskan mushing champions. His father, Dick Mackey, and brother Rick have also won the Iditarod. Dick Mackey's one-second win over Rick Swenson in 1978 set a record for the closest finish in Iditarod history. The Iditarod, though, isn't a competitive sprint to the finish for every musher in the field. Jim Lanier, 69, of Chugiak, Alaska, mushes primarily for enjoyment. He's entered and completed 13 Iditarods, at least one in all four decades the race has been in existence. He has never won. Rookie Iditarod musher Kristy Berington admits that she's not racing to win; she just hopes to finish. Her longest race prior to entering this year's Iditarod was only 300 miles. ""I've got puppies on this team that I want to see get to Nome. It's like watching your kid graduate from college,"" said the 25-year-old Kasilof, Alaska, resident. ""They go and they're puppies, and they come back and they're dogs."" She has been training with Iditarod veteran Paul Gebhardt and has borrowed one of his dog teams to lead her to Nome. Outside of personal accomplishments and goals, the race this year also presents an opportunity for some mushers to show their respect to fallen serviceman, thanks to a collaboration with the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors. Always a top competitor in the race, four-time Iditarod champion Martin Buser of Big Lake, Alaska, has six commemorative purple ribbons attached to his sled this year, placed there at the ceremonial start by the wives of the fallen soldiers and officers. Buser, who was born in Switzerland in 1958, became a U.S. citizen in 2002. ""After the 9/11 incident, I proved to my boys that this is the soil I wanted to defend ... so being asked to do such honors as these are very, very important to me because I'm truly one of the new immigrants and one of the staunches believers in our country,"" he said. Buser was naturalized under the famous burled arch in Nome at the finish line of the 2002 Iditarod. He carried an American flag in his sled for more than 1,000 miles to the finish line that year and set an Iditarod record for the shortest race time ever recorded: 8 days, 22 hours, 46 minutes and 2 seconds. His two sons are even named after Iditarod checkpoints: Nikolai and Rohn. The 2010 Iditarod musher's roster includes men and women ages 18 to 69 who hail from five countries: the United States, Canada, Scotland, Belgium and Jamaica. Some are professional mushers who raise and train sled dogs year-round; others are teachers, nurses, horse trainers, foresters or biologists. A doctor and a fishing guide also are included, among other professions. Asked to explain why mushers are drawn to this sport, four-time Iditarod champion Jeff King of Denali Park, Alaska, took time to reflect before answering. ""Until you've ridden a dog team you've trained from puppies on a full moon with a hard trail and feel their energy and hear the panting of their tongues, the jingle of their collars, feel the surge of power that comes through the handlebar, I don't think you can appreciate what it's really like,"" the 54-year-old said. ""But that's exactly the reason.""","38th year of famed Alaskan sled dog race begins with 71 teams .

"(CNN) -- Nicklas Bendtner scored a hat-trick as a rampant Arsenal side thrashed Porto 5-0 at The Emirates to reach the quarterfinals of the Champions League on Tuesday. Danish international Bendtner had been widely criticized for missing a host of chances in Arsenal's 3-1 Premier League win over Burnley on Saturday -- however, he was in the right place at the right time twice in the first-half as the Londonders comfortably overturned their 2-1 first leg deficit. The opening goal came in the 10th minute when Bendtner was on hand to fire into an empty net after goalkeeper Helton had rushed out to block the on-coming Andrey Arshavin. And he doubled the lead 15 minutes later after more good work from Russian Arshavin, who evaded two challenges on the edge of the area before crossing for the striker to comfortably slot home. Porto came out with more determination after the break but were hit by two goals in the space of three minutes around the hour mark. First, Frenchman Samir Nasir produced a moment of breathtaking skill and fast foot-work to dance around three Porto challenges before firing past Helton from an acute angle. Then, with their Portuguese opponents chasing the game, Arshavin collected the ball on the break after a Porto corner was cleared. He had Emmanuel Eboue overlapping in support -- and the pass was perfect for the Ivorian to round the goalkeeper before stroking the ball home. And a superb night for Arsenal -- and Bendtner in particular -- was completed in the final minute when Eboue was fouled in the penalty area, and the Dane stepped up to fire his penalty wide of Helton's despairing dive. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger told Sky Sports: ""It's never perfect but it was a very good performance, a strong performance. ""We had a very good first half, suffered a bit at the beginning of the second half, but Nasri's goal made a big difference and from then it was easy."" Meanwhile, Bayern Munich are also through to the last eight, progressing on the away goals rule despite losing 3-2 at Fiorentina. Their qualification was sealed with a stunning strike from Dutchman Arjen Robben, who skipped past a couple of challenges before firing home a thunderbolt shot from a full 30 meters out. The Serie A side took a 28th-minute lead when Juan Vargas netted from a tight angle after a week clearance from goalkeeper Jorg Butt. And the hosts doubled their advantage nine minutes after the break when Stevan Jovetic scored from close range after a superb Alberto Gilardino backheel. Bayern made the scores level 3-3 on aggregate on the hour mark when Mark Van Bommel drilled home a low shot after good work from Frank Ribery. However, just four minutes later Montenerin striker Jovetic out-muscled Daniel Van Buyten to fire home a Gilardino header-on. That sparked wild celebrations from the home bench and supporters, but just 72 seconds later Robben unleashed his devastating strike to break Florence hearts and complete a crazy spell of four goals in 12 minutes.","Arsenal thrash Porto 5-0 to cruise into the quarterfinals of the Champions League .

"(CNN) -- The driver of a Toyota Prius says he was taken on a wild ride Monday after the car's accelerator became stuck, reaching speeds in excess of 90 mph on a winding, hilly portion of a southern California interstate. It took the California Highway Patrol to bring the car safely to a stop. The driver, Jim Sikes, said he was traveling east on Interstate 8 outside of the San Diego area when he attempted to pass a slower vehicle. ""I pushed the gas pedal to pass a car, and it just did something kind of funny ... and it just stuck there,"" he said at a news conference outside a Highway Patrol office. ""As I was going, I was trying the brakes ... and it just kept speeding up."" Sikes said he called 911 for help, and dispatchers talked him through instructions on how he might be able to stop the car. But nothing worked. At one point, Sikes said he reached down to try to pull the accelerator up, but it ""stayed right where it was."" Alerted by emergency dispatchers, a California Highway Patrol officer was able to catch up to Sikes' Prius and used the patrol car's public address system to instruct Sikes to apply the brakes and the emergency brake at the same time. The tactic worked, and the car slowed to about 50 mph. Sikes said he was able to shut off the car, and it rolled to a stop. The responding officer, Todd Neibert, positioned his patrol car in front of the Prius as a precaution to prevent it from moving again. Toyota recently issued widespread recalls due to problems related to the accelerator pedal in several of its auto models. One theory behind the sticky accelerators is the vehicles' floor mats. But Sikes said ""my mat was perfect. There was nothing wrong with my mat."" Sikes said he took his 2008 Prius into a local Toyota dealership about two weeks ago for service and gave workers there his recall notice. He said he was told his car wasn't on the recall list. ""I'll be back there tomorrow,"" he said Monday, visibly shaken up. CHP spokesman Brian Pennings said the ordeal lasted just over 20 minutes. ""We are extremely thankful that there was a safe end to this,"" Pennings said. A Toyota spokesman issued a statement Monday night saying the automaker had been notified of the incident. ""Toyota has dispatched a field technical specialist to San Diego to investigate the report and offer assistance,"" the statement said.","""I pushed the gas pedal ... and it just stuck there,"" said Jim Sikes .

"Editor's note: Since becoming State Department producer in 2000, Elise Labott has covered four secretaries of state and reported from more than 50 countries. Before joining CNN, she covered the United Nations. Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton meet in Washington. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi made the rounds in Washington just as President Obama's national security team shifted its attention to Pakistan. This week Secretary of Defense Williams Gates called the Afghan border with Pakistan the ""epicenter of jihad."" And the renewed focus on Pakistan suggests that Obama has a new role for Pakistan in the battle against al Qaeda and the Taliban. After all, in developing a strategy for ""Afpak,"" Obama acknowledged the United States cannot win in Afghanistan without cooperation from Pakistan, the suspected hideout of Osama bin Laden and other al Qaeda leaders. Which is why the buzzword of both Qureshi and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton this week was ""partnership,"" as in the United States and Pakistan are united in a ""strategic partnership"" against a common enemy. Right now, the relationship between the two countries is less a partnership and more an uneasy marriage with a history fraught with decades of mutual mistrust and disappointment. In the late 1980s, the United States partnered with Pakistan to supply mujahedeen fighters with weapons and training to defeat the Soviets in Afghanistan. Then the United States abandoned the region, leaving the Pakistanis, in Clinton's words, ""awash in drugs...and jihadists who had been trained up in conjunction with us."" Now the Americans are back. But, rightly, the Pakistanis are wondering if this time they will stay. This week Qureshi urged the United States not to repeat history, but rather to articulate a ""long-term commitment"" for the region. That's exactly what the United States is trying to do with an aid package worth $1.5 billion a year for five years for social and economic development and with discretionary military spending. By building roads, schools and democratic institutions, the United States hopes to combat both Islamic extremism and anti-Americanism. In part the aid has had the opposite effect. Tough conditions attached to the aid to ensure the Pakistanis are fighting terrorism on their own soil have prompted fears and resentment about renewed -- and unwanted -- American influence. The military spending in the Kerry-Lugar legislation threatens to cut off assistance if Pakistan fails to crack down on extremists or uses the funding to attack neighboring countries, namely India. It requires Pakistan's cooperation in efforts to dismantle nuclear weapons networks operating in the country and demands Pakistan provides the information about its military budget and chain of command, all of which has given birth to grave concern in the military that the aid package is compromising Pakistan's sovereignty. The bill also makes reference to the southwestern city of Quetta and eastern town of Muridke. Both are believed to be hubs for al Qaeda and Taliban leaders, which suggests that the United States could target those cities for the kind of drone attacks which have drawn Pakistani ire. As the Pakistani parliament debates the bill, street protests over the aid have spread through the country. The fears about sovereignty have only been aggravated over U.S. plans to send hundreds more diplomats to its embassy in Islamabad. Washington says the additional staff is needed to distribute and monitor the aid, but it has all left Pakistanis humiliated and feeling like a child who needs a babysitter. Pakistan also wants more credit from the United States for decisive action it has taken against terrorists, including its recent offensive in the Swat Valley. The United States has been impressed by the Pakistani army's recent offensive against the Taliban in Swat. And it is encouraged that Pakistan is gearing up to launch a major offensive in Waziristan, believed to be a stronghold of both the Taliban and al Qaeda. But the conditions attached to the aid are a symptom of the United States' longstanding doubts about the Pakistanis' capacity to be a reliable partner it needs in the struggle against al Qaeda and the Taliban. Not only are there concerns about Pakistani intelligence ties to extremist networks, but the United States continues to fear Pakistan's obsession with its nuclear neighbor India will divert its focus from fighting terrorist threats on its own soil. As the United States struggles over the future of the mission in Afghanistan, Pakistan wants to strengthen cooperation. This week Qureshi said the United States needed to share more critical information it has about al Qaeda and the Taliban on its border. What's more, he suggested the administration should consult with both the Pakistani military and civilian government before deciding to send more troops. The sad legacy of U.S. and Pakistani relations can be overcome only if both counties are able to rebuild trust. Pakistan needs to answer lingering questions about the country's commitment to fighting terrorism. And after 20 years of neglect, the United States needs to assure Pakistan it won't exploit it for its own interests, only to abandon the region once again. Only then will this uneasy marriage give way to a true partnership.","U.S.-Pakistan relationship fraught with decades of mistrust and disappointment .

"OKAZAKI, Japan (CNN) -- At Spencer Morrey's home, there are two constant sounds: his dad, Craig, murmuring, ""You're okay, Spence. You're okay, buddy,"" and the sound of a machine clearing the toddler's airway. Spencer Morrey, pictured with his father Craig, has severe cerebral palsy and requires 24-hour medical care. Both sounds come every few minutes, in between hugs, tears and kisses. Spencer has severe cerebral palsy and requires constant, 24-hour medical care. In Japan, a country that lacks sufficient medical services for disabled children, the only person to care for Spencer is his father. Morrey says his wife left, overwhelmed by the strain of their son's medical condition. That would be pain beyond what most parents could imagine. But Spencer's mother fled while pregnant with Morrey's daughter, Amelia. In more than a year, Morrey says he has only seen his daughter four times. ""She wouldn't recognize me,"" Morrey said, with Spencer propped on his lap. ""She wouldn't call me daddy. She's just starting to talk now. But she's not going to know who I am. I think she deserves my love. And I think she deserves to be with Spencer and Spencer deserves to be with her."" Morrey, a native of Chicago and a U.S. citizen, was married to a Brazilian woman of Japanese descent. They divorced in a Japanese court. Under Brazilian law, Morrey would likely have joint custody and guardianship of both children. What do you think about Spencer's case? Have your say . But in Japan, where only one parent gets custody of a child in a divorce, the family courts have left the case in legal limbo for a year because they have not decided which parent legally has custody of the children. Typically, the parent with physical custody of a child retains custody. Morrey has stayed in Japan the last year, trying to get the courts to recognize that he has joint custody of the children in Brazil (he has not yet applied for such custody under U.S. law).  Watch Kyung Lah's report on the case » . He is afraid that if he heads home for the U.S. with Spencer without that, he could be subject to international child abduction laws, and he also fears such a move could hurt his chances of getting the Japanese family court to give him joint custody of his daughter. Morrey has been forced to quit work to care for Spencer. The financial strain of living off his credit cards is adding to the stress of caring for a disabled child alone in a foreign country. Despite his pleading with court mediators and repeated court filings claiming that joint custody is the law in both the U.S. and Brazil, Japan's slow and antiquated family courts have let the case languish. ""Kids need both parents,"" Morrey said. ""Whether the parents are married or not is irrelevant in my mind. The Japanese courts, and I realize you're going against years and years of cultural differences and everything else, but they don't care about the welfare of the child. ""In Japan, it's considered too messy. It's too complicated. It deals with personal feelings, so they don't want to deal with it. So the best way is to not deal with it."" CNN contacted Morrey's ex-wife four times by telephone and once by fax. She declined to discuss the case. The International Association for Parent and Child Reunion believes there are an estimated 100 American families in situations like Morrey's in Japan and dozens involving those from Britain, France and Canada. One of those cases is that of American Christopher Savoie. Savoie, 38, a Tennessee native and naturalized Japanese citizen, was arrested on September 28 in Yanagawa, Japan, for attempting to abduct his two children, eight-year-old Isaac and six-year-old Rebecca.  Watch more about this case » . Savoie drove his children to the nearest U.S. consulate in the city of Fukuoka to try and obtain passports for them. Steps away from the front of the consulate, Japanese police arrested him. Savoie is now in jail, awaiting a decision by prosecutors on a possible indictment. Savoie and his first wife, Noriko Savoie, were married for 14 years before their bitter divorce in January. According to court documents, she fled with the children to Japan in the summer. A U.S. court then gave Christopher Savoie sole custody of the children. But Japanese law recognizes Noriko Savoie as the sole custodian, despite the U.S. order. ""It's like a black hole,"" Morrey said. ""If you go through a divorce, there's this joke. If you have an international marriage with a Japanese, don't piss them off because you'll never see your kids again."" Not seeing his daughter Amelia again is what is keeping Morrey in Japan. He has been selling off everything he owns, trying to keep himself and Spencer afloat, hoping the Japanese court will bring him some legal connection to his child. He is stuck choosing between caring for his son, who needs the better resources of the U.S., and hoping to be a father to his daughter. ""How do you make that choice? It's not -- once you're a dad, you're always a dad.""","Craig Morrey's wife left him to care for their disabled son, Spencer, alone .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- China has threatened to slap sanctions on American companies that sell arms to its rival Taiwan as part of a range of punitive actions Beijing is taking to protest the deal. China also summoned U.S. ambassador Jon Huntsman to express its anger over Washington's announcement, the official Chinese news agency Xinhua said, citing the Foreign Ministry. Beijing also suspended plans for visits between the Chinese and U.S. militaries and postponed a high-level arms control meeting, it announced Saturday, following Washington's $6.4-billion arms deal with Taiwan. China's Defense Ministry said the decision was made ""in consideration of the serious harm and impacts on Sino-U.S. military relations"" brought about by the arms deal, according to Xinhua. ""China will make further judgments as appropriate,"" Xinhua reported. China had already complained to the United States about the deal, announced Friday by the Obama administration. Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei called it a ""rude interference in China's internal affairs, severely endangering China's national security"" and said China expressed its ""strong indignation."" The arms sale includes 60 Black Hawk helicopters, totaling $3.1 billion; 114 advanced Patriot air defense missiles; a pair of Osprey mine-hunting ships; and dozens of advanced communications systems. The deal with Taiwan -- which neither China nor the United States recognizes as an independent country -- does not include F-16 fighter jets, which China has vehemently opposed. The State Department described the latest round of arms sales to Taiwan as a way to guarantee security and stability, despite China's objections. ""This is a clear demonstration of the commitment this administration has to provide Taiwan with defensive weapons it needs and as provided for in the Taiwan Relations Act,"" State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Friday. He said the action is consistent with Washington's ""one-China"" policy and will help maintain security and stability across the Taiwan Strait. The arms sales come as the United States is hoping to persuade China to sign on to harsher sanctions against Iran and just after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized China for its policies relating to the Internet. Crowley would not speak directly about the timing of the announcement of the sales, and about the fact that the arms package does not include F-16s. A senior U.S. official said later that the United States expected Chinese criticism of the arms deal, but does not expect permanent damage. The official said he believed Clinton had discussed the sale in London with her Chinese counterpart on the sidelines of Thursday's international conference on Afghanistan. ""This relationship between the United States and China is broad, it's deep. There are a large number of issues. We don't see eye to eye with them and we have to have and do have the ability to speak honestly,"" the official said. The arms deal is the latest chapter in a decades-long uneasy standoff. China claims Taiwan is its own territory and has threatened to invade if Taiwan ever declares independence. The United States has said it will defend Taiwan if China ever attacks. The government in Taiwan began as the remnant of the government that ruled over mainland China until a Communist insurrection proved victorious in 1949. With the Communist takeover of mainland China, the losing faction fled to the island of Taiwan. Taiwan is formally known as the Republic of China, while Communist China's official name is People's Republic of China. Many Western nations and the United Nations recognized Taiwan as the legitimate Chinese government until the 1970s. CNN's Eve Bower and Charley Keyes contributed to this report.","China considers sanctions against U.S. companies over arms deal with Taiwan .

"(CNN) -- A deadly car bomb attack on a busy market in Peshawar Wednesday continued a bloody trend of atrocities in Pakistan during October. Ten attacks have been carried out so far this month, resulting in nearly 400 deaths, according to security expert Will Geddes, chief executive of International Corporate Protection. Geddes gives CNN his assessment on the latest attack and the challenges facing the Pakistan forces. Why Peshawar and why now? No one's actually releasing any statement, but I would say it's a retaliatory action to the seizing of Kotkai, a town in the South Waziristan district by Pakistani troops almost two weeks ago on October 17. The Taliban is setting off devices and suicide bombs in other parts of the country to draw attention away from Waziristan to make it harder for them. Because obviously troops will be deployed to the areas perceived to be the greatest threat. It's a pretty smart tactic on behalf of the Taliban. Why did the attackers target the marketplace Meena Bazaar? It's indiscriminate. It's the purest essence of terrorism. It is to absolutely instill fear and terror into the general populace. Whether that works effectively and advantageously for them in the longer run, I don't think so. Because ultimately it will be the local community who will be feeding intelligence back to Pakistani intelligence service, the Inter-Services Intelligence. If you alienate that community by targeting them then you're not winning the support of people who are potentially going to hide you out or not disclose your whereabouts, your location or your operations. It is a risky tactic. It is showing the arrogance of the Taliban. They don't care who they target -- they just want to terrorize the whole nation. How much can be read into the timing of the attacks? It coincides with Hillary Clinton being in the country. It's fundamentally saying: ""You've got a high-ranked world leader who's a guest in the country, and we're showing you we're still kicking your backside,"" for lack of better words. It's really to make President Zardari lose face, as well as to continue the turmoil across the country and to show to the international community that the Taliban is winning. It is the latest in a series of deadly attacks this October. Why is the Taliban so active now? The Taliban are always more active up in the mountains in the autumn months because it's far harder for the enemy to be successful. It is colder, the terrain's harder. The Taliban are experts at fighting in mountainous regions. The Taliban will generally come down on to the flats during the summer months and during the winter months they retreat back up into the mountains. What would conditions be like on the ground? It would be very cold, very brutal. It would be tough, tough terrain for any military forced to try to fight against the Taliban. They are kings of their castle in many respects in those regions. Can you see the fighting intensifying between now and the end of the year? The Pakistan military will find it incredibly hard going to battle against them as the winter months progress. There is very possibly going to be some kind of withdrawal, maybe the closer we get to the end of the year, because it starts becoming more and more brutal before the early months of the year. It's like Afghanistan; you don't want to be down there in January or February. However the government can't lose face and they can't seem to be losing. Is there anything the government can do to halt the spate of suicide attacks? If you have got sorties from the Taliban coming down into Islamabad and Karachi and undertaking attacks there, it's very difficult to intersect. Quite often what you may have is a group that is working in Karachi and Islamabad who will be the resource; they'll be the ones doing the reconnaissance, looking at the various targets and then the suicide bombers would likely come down to be briefed by the local team and pointed to the explosives, wherever they might be. It demonstrates their determined campaign to embarrass and humiliate Zardari's government. iReporter: ""Increasing chaos"" in Pakistan .","Car bomb in Peshawar market killed at least 100 people, injured many more .

"(CNN) -- About 1,000 National Guard soldiers will report for duty Saturday in Puerto Rico, activated by the governor this week to help fight a drug-fueled crime tsunami that has flooded the Caribbean island. The military personnel will repair police cruisers and join local authorities on patrols in the most crime-ridden areas of Puerto Rico, mainly in poor parts of the commonwealth's largest cities. One soldier will accompany a police officer on each patrol, said the National Guard chief, Maj. Gen. Antonio Vicens. ""The problem that exists now is that the police are short of personnel,"" Vicens said. ""What we are going to do solely is to help them. First, we are going to help them with mechanics, provide them with more than 100 mechanics so that their fleet of patrol cars can go out on the street. Once we have that, we are going to have joint preventive patrols. ""You won't see military vehicles on the street. What you'll see are police patrols on the street."" The soldiers will be deployed in San Juan, the territory's capital, and the cities of Carolina, Bayamon and Ponce. Gov. Luis Fortuno announced the call-up in his annual state of Puerto Rico speech Monday night, saying the help is needed until more officers can be trained. He did not set a timetable. In a separate development, Fortuno announced Tuesday that U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez Velez had reached an agreement with the commonwealth's Justice Department and Puerto Rico Police Department for federal prosecutors to have jurisdiction over a series of major crimes. Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States and more stringent federal U.S. laws can apply. ""To those who commit carjackings,"" Fortuno said, ""to those who provoke shootouts on our roads ... to sexual offenders who rob our children of our innocence, our message is clear: We're going to impose on them the full weight of the federal law. We're going to look for them, and we're going to bring them to justice."" Rodriguez said the agreement will streamline the prosecution of cases and allow federal agents immediate access to some crime scenes. ""We feel very strongly about fighting crime,"" she said Thursday. ""It's much better to fight crime together. This is an additional crime-fighting measure."" By all measures, there's much crime to fight. A 2010 threat assessment by a 15-agency task force notes there were 68,738 violent crimes reported in 2008, a 9.3 percent increase over the previous year. Of the 13 major police areas in Puerto Rico, the municipality of Bayamon was the worst, with 16,590 violent crimes. Homicides also showed a significant increase, with 807 killings reported in 2008, the latest year for which statistics were available. That was a 10.5 percent increase over the previous year. Homicides had already increased by 9.2 percent in 2007. San Juan had the highest homicide rate in 2008, with 177 slayings. Bayamon was second-highest, with 154 killings. As in many other parts of the world, authorities tie the crime jump to drugs. ""It's strong. It's very strong,"" Rodriguez told CNN. A recent Puerto Rico Police Department report documented that more than 60 percent of the slayings on the island were directly related to drug trafficking. ""Drug-related violence is endemic in Puerto Rico,"" said a 2009 analysis by the Justice Department's National Drug Intelligence Center. ""Homicide rates typically rank among the highest in the United States, and law enforcement officials report that most of these homicides are related to drug trafficking. [Drug-trafficking organizations] and gangs frequently use intimidation, violence and murder to gain and retain control of retail drug markets in the region."" The largest gangs predominantly operate in public housing projects scattered throughout San Juan, Aguadilla, Fajardo and Ponce, the 15-agency threat assessment said. Drug gangs also operate in lower-income neighborhoods where they feel less vulnerable to law enforcement. Cocaine, crack-cocaine, marijuana, heroin and Ecstasy are the drugs most widely trafficked, officials say. Puerto Rico is particularly vulnerable because of its location. ""The Caribbean region remains a major transshipment area for cocaine and heroin shipments originating from Colombia, transiting through Venezuela and destined to the United States, Europe and Canada,"" the multiagency report said. The criminals are well-financed and well-armed. ""Large-caliber assault type rifles such as AK-47s, M-16s and various types of military carbines are the weapons of choice,"" the report said. ""In some instances, rifles recovered in the streets have been converted to fire in the fully automatic mode. The handguns of choice are Glocks and Smith & Wesson pistols converted to fire in the fully automatic mode, thus providing added fire power."" The National Drug Intelligence Center also notes that Puerto Rico ""is a major money-laundering center for drug traffickers operating in the region."" Although Puerto Rican officials did not mention it this week, there's another reason for the National Guard deployment. ""Public confidence in the [Puerto Rico Police Department's] ability to protect the citizenry remains low because of continued corruption within the department,"" the National Drug Intelligence Center analysis said. ""This situation has resulted in decreased cooperation between the public and the police department and has made it more difficult for police officers to deter crime and enforce the law. ""Consequently, it is likely that the crime rate in Puerto Rico will remain high and the drug situation will worsen in the next year as traffickers take advantage of a perceived law enforcement weakness."" Vicens, the National Guard general in charge, believes the military can help change that. ""We are the beneficiaries of a [good] reputation and confidence on the part of the public,"" he said in a published interview this week. ""When we act, we act professionally. That will help us accomplish our objectives."" Some Puerto Ricans wonder whether the military can solve the problem. ""It might help,"" said Tony Santiago, owner of Rent the Bike in Old San Juan. He questioned whether some of the Guard members are up to the task. ""What do they do for a living,"" he asked. ""Maybe they don't have the knowledge to handle the situation like a policeman would."" No one seems to question that there's a problem and that something needs to be done about it. Gwenn Bentz and her husband own Coqui's Hideaway, a vacation rental cottage 45 minutes east of San Juan. ""It doesn't affect us personally because we live up in the mountains,"" she said. ""It's mostly in the cities."" Nonetheless, she and some neighbors are starting a crime-watch group. ""Is there crime? Yes, sure. That's gone up,"" Bentz said. And the governor feels he has to act, she said. ""I think Fortuno realizes that something has to get done about the violent crime, drug problems, and the police don't seem to be able to get the problem under control,"" said Bentz, a New Jersey native who has lived in Puerto Rico for six years. ""So if the National Guard can help, I am happy he is trying something."" A few minutes later, she was not so sure. ""I don't think the National Guard troops activation is the answer to the problem, but I guess it can't hurt,"" she said . U.S. Attorney Rodriguez, a 32-year veteran of the justice system, believes her office's new powers will make a difference. ""I have much hope,"" she said. And if anything can make the situation better, she said, it's intervention by federal authorities. ""I am rich in satisfaction,"" the prosecutor said. ""The United States has always taken care of Puerto Rico. It's a good father.""","Violent crimes, homicides on the rise in Puerto Rico .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Marina Ochoa keeps a handful of photos of her little brother in a faded yellow envelope. She has a black-and-white snapshot of him as a baby and some color portraits of him as a successful banker in Miami, Florida. And then there's one of him as a 7-year-old, about to be airlifted out of Cuba. That was the last time she ever saw him. ""I went to the airport to see him off,"" the Cuban filmmaker said at her Havana home. Her brother Frank was one of 14,000 Cuban children quietly sent to the United States between 1960 and 1962, at the start of Fidel Castro's revolution. Their parents were terrified the new government would strip them of parental authority and ship their kids off to work camps in what was then the Soviet Union, or send them into the countryside on literacy campaigns. Those fears deepened when the state nationalized industries, confiscated private property and closed religious and private schools. ""Our parents thought they would soon join my brother or that this government wouldn't last,"" Ochoa said. ""My father thought, 'Americans won't put up with this radical revolution.' "" Her parents wanted to send Ochoa, then 11, but she refused to go. The clandestine program came to be known as Operation Peter Pan. It was backed by Washington and coordinated by the Catholic Church, which helped Cuban children get U.S. visas and once in America, find a family or go to foster homes or orphanages. But things didn't play out as expected. To begin with, a CIA-backed invasion failed to topple Castro. With the subsequent Cuban missile crisis, relations between Havana and Washington broke off completely, making travel and even communication almost impossible. Many parents couldn't get U.S. visas, and others couldn't get permission to leave Cuba. Latin pop star Willy Chirino and former U.S. Sen. Mel Martinez of Florida are perhaps the best-known of the ""Peter Pan"" kids. The operation inspires mixed feelings. Many Cuban exiles argue that the airlift saved children who might have died trying to escape on rafts or grown up under a repressive regime. Others say the clandestine program put many kids at unnecessary risk, with a few suffering abuse in foster homes and orphanages. Silvia Wilhelm was airlifted out when she was just 14. She didn't come back to Cuba for more than 30 years but now visits frequently and promotes cultural and religious exchanges. ""I will always respect my parents' decision, because they made it at a juncture in time that was when their whole world was falling apart,"" she said. Her parents managed to get coveted U.S. visas a year later and moved to Florida. ""I think at the end of the day we were pawns between political powers, two countries."" But it took years for other families to be reunited, and 20 percent of the children never saw their parents again. Ochoa's brother Frank drifted from home to home, and his family eventually gave up trying to join him. ""He felt so alone that he wrote to my mother, filling pages with the same sentence: Come Mommy. Come Mommy,"" she said. In 1993, Frank died. He was only in his 30s. ""When the bureaucratic hurdles started to ease, it was too late. My brother was already sick. My mother had already died without ever seeing him again,"" she said. Ochoa started work on a documentary about the exodus a year later. Politics still divide the countries, but many families touched by Operation Peter Pan have started to reach out to people and places they thought they had lost. Last year, President Obama lifted restrictions on allowing Cuban-Americans to visit relatives in Cuba and made it easier for them to send money to relatives.","14,000 Cuban children sent to U.S. at start of Castro's revolution .

"LUKAVAC, Bosnia-Herzegovina (CNN)  -- The man's remains lie on a table. Next to him are the bones of his 22-year-old son and the remains of another son. But no one yet knows which of the man's two missing boys the third set of remains could be. Cheryl Katzmarzyk measures a leg bone as she puts together remains from Srebrenica. Cheryl Katzmarzyk wants to be able to put a name to the remains, and to those of hundreds of other bodies stacked around her in a building in Lukavac, near Tuzla in the northeast of Bosnia. The bones are from more than 8,000 men and boys slaughtered in 1995 during the Bosnian war at Srebrenica in the worst massacre in Europe since World War II. The killers -- Serbs seeking to drive out Bosnian Muslims in a policy of ""ethnic cleansing"" -- executed the region's fighting-age males, then used bulldozers to dump them into mass graves. What makes the work harder for the teams trying to put the bodies back together -- so they can be returned to their families for proper burial -- is that so many have been broken up over the years. Mass graves were dug up and the bodies moved sometimes again and again, to hide evidence as the Serbs retreated amid the NATO bombing that followed Srebrenica and led to the end of the war. Those killed in a warehouse execution at Srebrenica are spread throughout 20 secondary grave sites, for instance. Katzmarzyk said remains of one of the victims was found in eight different parts of one mass grave. Another man's shoulder was found where he and others were lined up and shot, one of his legs was found near a grave, a hip was found inside the grave, his upper jaw several miles away and his left arm in a secondary grave. ""What we do here is we sort them out,"" said Katzmarzyk, the head of anthropological examinations for the International Commission on Missing Persons. Katzmarzyk's team from the ICMP -- a nongovernmental organization set up at the end of the Bosnian war to locate and identify victims of war and human rights abuses -- has pioneered quicker, simpler DNA tests to work out which bones go together.  Watch an audio slideshow about the ICMP's work » . Then, a more extensive DNA test is done to see if there is a match with any of thousands of relatives who have donated their own samples in the hope of finding missing relatives. But DNA can only go so far, and while it can show that the unidentified remains on Katzmarzyk's table are those of a man and his 22-year-old son, it cannot say whether the third set belongs to a missing 21-year-old or his 24-year-old brother -- because neither had children to act as an extra reference point. It's a particular problem with identifying the Srebrenica dead because so many of the victims were related. Across the room, brothers lie next to each other, but as yet the scientists do not know who is who. So Katzmarzyk and her colleagues are also experts in forensic anthropology, using other pointers to make an identification. They will look for clues to the age of the remains and any other factors that could identify them: Did the man break his leg as a child? What clothes was he wearing? How tall was he? ""We started to look at clothing, place of disappearance,"" said Katzmarzyk. ""We use all kinds of evidence to identify as many people as possible.""  Watch a Bosnia concentration camp survivor describe the torture and rape she witnessed » . About 5,200 people out of the 8,000 executed at Srebrenica have been identified with the help of ICMP, but new mass graves continue to be found and more remains are delivered to the facility in Lukavac to be matched. Years of work lie ahead -- if governments continue to contribute to the project. ""We still have many more IDs to make, but what we need are additional funds to ensure that the process is completed. It's essential. ... This is a unique contribution to the investigation of genocide,"" said Katzmarzyk, who was recently working on 842 sets of remains, all but one of them male. Evidence gathered by the ICMP about the Srebrenica genocide could also be used against former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who is set to face trial at The Hague, accused of ordering the massacre. ICMP helped identify victims of Hurricane Katrina and the Asian tsunami, but its main work continues in the former Yugoslavia, where the condition of the remains makes it vital to use DNA, forensic anthropology and anything else to piece skeletons together and give them a name. ""The ICMP is unique in that all these lines of inquiry are used together,"" Katzmarzyk said. ""DNA is essential, anthropology is essential."" The work is challenging scientifically and sometimes emotionally, she said. It is rewarding and satisfying to identify remains and allow them to be released to the coroner and then to the family. But some cases are more haunting. ""The fact that I have three brothers lying side by side on a table -- how can that not affect you?"" Katzmarzyk asked. ""And there's a fourth brother missing.""","Scientists piece together remains of massacre victims .

"Central Falls, Rhode Island (CNN) -- Graduates of the nation's most vilified high school descended upon campus Tuesday evening to support the school's fired teachers. They also had a message for President Obama: Don't bash our school. ""He doesn't know us. He doesn't know the teachers. He doesn't know the students,"" said Nikko Calle, 21, a graduate of Central Falls High School in 2006. ""I think it's a real outrage what's happening here."" Nearby, Ashley Delgado, 19, stood on the school's steps clutching a sign that read: ""Dear Obama, I supported you, your causes, goals and beliefs. Why aren't you supporting mine?"" A firestorm has erupted in this Democratic stronghold in recent weeks after 93 teachers, support staff and administrators at Central Falls High School were fired for the low performance of the school, which graduated just 48 percent of its seniors last year. The firings will go into effect at the end of the school year. Teachers can re-apply, but no more than 50 percent will get rehired. Obama weighed in last week, endorsing the actions of the local board. ""Our kids get only one chance at an education and we need to get it right,"" the president said. Obama's comments further inflamed an already tense environment in this poor Rhode Island enclave, just outside Providence. ""I couldn't believe it,"" said Delgado, who graduated in 2008. ""Ever since the beginning, I thought firing all the teachers was a ridiculous notion."" About 70 young people, most of them graduates of the school and now in college or working, demonstrated peacefully outside the school in the largely Hispanic, working class neighborhood. They expressed outrage and disbelief that the school they attended has become a national pariah. ""We stand together for our teachers and for our school,"" said Katherine Lopera, 20, a graduate in 2007. Her classmate, Sindy Alvisures, said, ""The teachers are literally like our family. When I went through high school, I went through a lot of personal problems and my teachers were always there for me."" Of the 800 students who currently attend Central Falls, 65 percent are Hispanic; English is a second language for most. Half the students are failing every subject, with 55 percent skilled in reading and 7 percent proficient in math, officials say. The defenders of the school say improvements have been made, but the stats are skewed against them because the school's population is so transient. Tuesday's demonstration was to coincide with a board of trustees meeting, where the firings were to be the main topic. However, the meeting was abruptly called off, because the Governor's Commission on Disabilities said the school's auditorium was unfit for people with disabilities. On the steps outside the school, George McLaughlin shrugged. He cast suspicion on the reason for the meeting's cancellation. ""Unless they mean, it's not fit for morally disabled people,"" he said. McLaughlin has been a guidance counselor at Central Falls for the last 15 years. His wife is a chemistry teacher. ""We will lose all of our income."" He suggested Obama should summon the 93 teachers and administrators for a beer summit. The president ""hasn't heard our side of the story,"" said McLaughlin, a member of the teachers' union. ""He hasn't listened to us. He knows nothing about us."" Marcia Reback, president of the Rhode Island Federation of Teachers, was less hospitable toward the president. ""We're all taking our bumper stickers for Obama off our cars,"" Reback said earlier in the day. She said the union supports school reform. She called for an independent mediator to intervene at Central Falls because tensions have gotten so high between the union and the school administrators who carried out the firings. ""This is unprecedented,"" Reback said. ""I don't think anyone was prepared for this kind of fallout."" School superintendent Fran Gallo said she stands by her decision. She noted the school didn't graduate half its seniors last year. ""Somebody hasn't spoken up for them, the other 50 percent,"" she said. As darkness fell at the school, the graduates who had come back said the problems at the school have been oversimplified and that the rest of the nation can't understand the importance of the teachers in the tough environment they live. Nikko Calle said one of the most important men in his life was his creative writing teacher, Michael Occhi. A freshly planted tree stands on the school's lawn to honor the legacy of Occhi. He was killed in an accident by a drunk driver last summer. Encouraged by his high school teacher, Calle has taken up poetry. ""A lot of these teachers here helped me through hard times,"" he said. ""They were always here for me."" Now, many here wonder what the legacy of the school will be next.","About 70 young people, most of them graduates of the school, demonstrated Tuesday .

"Chicago, Illinois (CNN) -- The four people found dead this week in a suburban Chicago home were the victims of a murder-suicide, a coroner said. A man, a woman and two boys were found dead Wednesday in a house in Addison, Illinois, west of Chicago, according to the DuPage County coroner's office. A statement from the coroner's office identified the four as Thomas Mangiantini, 48, his wife Elizabeth, 46, and the couple's two sons, Angelo, 12, and Thomas, 8. The deaths of Elizabeth Mangiantini and the two children were called homicides in the coroner's report. Thomas Mangiantini's manner of death was ruled a suicide, the report said. Police received a 911 call from a woman at 6:30 a.m. CT Wednesday, according to CNN affiliate WGN-TV in Chicago. When officers arrived at the scene, they found a female dead downstairs in the house and the bodies of three males upstairs, according to WGN. A spokesman for the Addison Police Department declined to give more information Friday.","Coroner says four are victims of murder-suicide in Addison, Illinois, house .

"(CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama is saddled with a potentially toxic image problem: that he has an elitist attitude. Sen. Barack Obama mingles at the Penn State dairy farm. It has made him a target of attacks from Democratic rival Sen. Hillary Clinton and Sen. John McCain, the presumed Republican nominee. It's ironic that one presidential candidate could hang that label on another, said Dr. Drew Westen, professor of psychology and psychiatry at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, and author of ""The Political Brain."" ""If you think you should be president, by definition you are an elitist, only because you believe that of the 300 million people in America, you are the best person to run it,"" he said. ""There can't be a more elitist statement than that."" Obama's opponents made the elitist charge after the senator from Illinois said some small-town Pennsylvanians are understandably ""bitter"" over the government's failure to reverse their economic decline and, in their frustration, ""cling to guns and religion."" He made the statement at a recent fundraiser in San Francisco, California.  Watch how Obama is fighting the elitist label » . Obama defended his remarks but said he could have worded them better. Clinton said his comments were ""elitist, out of touch and frankly, patronizing."" McCain agreed that the remarks were ""elitist."" Branding a rival elitist is not new in politics. Republicans for years have successfully labeled Democratic presidential candidates as the liberal elite. Portraying their rivals as latte-sipping, sushi-eating insiders, Republicans have connected with some voters by arguing that they understand the values important to the everyday person. ""It's a little like when politicians charge politicians with being politicians. It has the same feel to it: that if it sticks, it's because a candidate hasn't handled it well,"" Westen said. Republicans painted George W. Bush's Democratic opponents Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004 as elitists who were detached from average Americans, and the strategy worked. How damaging the blow is, Westen said, depends on the target's response. ""The mistake that Kerry and Gore both made was to let that brand stick to them,"" he said. ""The only question is whether Obama fights it back and offers a different brand for himself than the brand that is starting to be given to him."" By definition, all the candidates exhibit the aura of elitism, because it's difficult to get a presidential campaign started without some degree of personal wealth. It's ironic, Westen said, that of the three standing, the only one who isn't demonstrably wealthy is Obama. Since leaving the White House, the Clintons have earned more than $109 million from book sales, speaking engagements, the presidential pension and her Senate salary, among other sources. McCain, whose father and grandfather were Navy admirals, married into wealth. His second wife, Cindy, has a stake in her father's multimillion-dollar beer distributor company. The Associated Press estimated her worth at more than $100 million. Whatever their current financial status, the candidates all like to convey the impression that they are not much different than the people they are trying to persuade to vote for them. Obama, 46, who graduated from Columbia University and received a law degree from Harvard, often mentions growing up in a single-parent home. He says he and his wife just paid off their school loans in the past five or six years. ""I wasn't born into a lot of money. I didn't have a trust fund. I wasn't born into fame and fortune. I was raised by a single mother with the help of my grandparents,"" he said. ""My mother had to use food stamps at one point."" Clinton, who has been reaching out to blue-collar voters with stories of how she learned to shoot a gun in Pennsylvania and photo ops hoisting a shot and a beer, often talks about her middle-class upbringing. Clinton, 60, went to Wellesley College before attending law school at Yale. After graduation, she advocated for women and children's rights and became a staff attorney for the Children's Defense Fund. She later became a partner in a law firm and was twice listed as one of the 100 most influential lawyers in the country. The senator from New York frequently touts her 35 years of public service, including eight as first lady. McCain spent a week traveling around on a ""get-to-know-me"" tour. He talked about how he was a rambunctious child with a chip on his shoulder. McCain, 71, went to the United States Naval Academy and frequently jokes about finishing at the bottom of his class. After graduation, he spent 22 years as a naval pilot. He was shot down on a bombing mission and spent five years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam. He retired from the Navy in 1981 and, living in Arizona, became a member of the House the next year. He was elected to the Senate in 1986 and is serving his fourth term. Dr. James Twitchell, an author, University of Florida English professor and commentator on American culture, said the whole elitism back-and-forth is ""self-serving nonsense,"" pointing specifically to the similarities in the Democratic contenders' stories. ""Both senators are members of one of the more elite clubs [the Senate], attended the elite schools [Harvard, Yale] and are out for one of the most elite jobs,"" he said. As the candidates get closer to the White House, they get farther away from ""normal life."" They fight to show they still share the average American's values, visiting bowling alleys, diners and schools along the way. ""I do think it speaks to one of the conflicts that Americans have about their leaders, which is we want them to be like us, and we want them to be above us at the same time,"" Westen said. ""The issue comes down to two things. One is, do you let your opponent brand you as elite, in which case you are in a lot of trouble in American politics? And the second is, do you convey clearly to people that you understand them and the world they live in and the problems they face?"" he said. ""In the case of Barack Obama, my guess is, this isn't going to stick terribly well because he does such a good job of connecting with people that the elitist charge is going to be a harder one to make people feel.""

"San Francisco, California (CNN)  -- Before the protests of tuition hikes last week, a colleague posted the following: ""Need suggestions for protest songs. We have a DJ but need to give her a play list."" The requests started coming in: Joan Baez, the Dixie Chicks, The Clash. I wondered about the overlap between songs on a professor's play list and those on a student's. So I went to class and asked students to tell me what they wanted to hear. The list included Dead Prez, Lyrics Born, B-Side Players and Erykah Badu, among many others. This is the protest play list of a new generation. My introduction to protest songs came through my mom. As the daughter of a Chicano movement activist, I attended protests against wars in Central America and rallies in response to police repression. Last week, I marched in solidarity with people across 17 states calling for well-funded, accessible public education. While at the March 4 rally, I realized that California's public education system has had a great impact on who my mother and I are today. As a 15-year-old immigrant newly arrived in Los Angeles, my mother was placed in remedial classes because she didn't speak English. She struggled with the language but excelled in math. Yet her high school counselor directed her to work at a local tortilla factory. This was the early 1960s, just a few years before students responded to educational inequities through organized acts of civil disobedience that would later be referred to as the East Los Angeles blowouts. It was only by chance, and without parental or institutional guidance, that my mom enrolled in East Los Angeles College. Like many other low-income and working students, community college was her entry into higher education. It was not until her mid-30s that she enrolled in the California State University of Los Angeles while working full time. I was in elementary school and remember going to campus with her on days that my dad was working, even during an in-class exam. This was my first exposure to a university classroom. Since then, I have taught at the California State University of Los Angeles and the University of California at San Diego. I am currently an assistant professor at San Francisco State University. Watching preschool teachers and children participating in the recent marches reminded me that my education began at Head Start. My mom enrolled me in this program, which provided early reading and math skills and set a foundation for my educational development. I stand in solidarity with early childhood educators. At the protest, I watched high school students confidently take the stage and list their demands and hopes for a better future. I wish that my mom, as a teenage immigrant, could have aired her own frustrations with the 1960s educational system. Today's high school students inspire me, and I am proud of today's teachers, who support their students. I ran into some of my own students at the rally. One asked where she could hear the DJ playing her song request. We searched through the sea of people and realized the turnout was much larger than we had imagined. The protest play lists of multiple generations filled the air with music. Young fans of Dead Prez marched and chanted alongside older fans of Joan Baez. They all recognized the need for well-funded, accessible public education. Rising student fees have placed barriers between thousands of eligible students and their dreams of higher education. In addition, budget cuts and the subsequent elimination of course offerings have extended the number of years necessary to graduate. Many of my students have taken on multiple jobs to finance their education. I hear their stories and imagine my mom trying to attend Cal State L.A. today. Younger generations in the U.S. have consistently achieved a higher level of education than the generation that came before. But for the first time since World War II, we are in danger of reversing that trend. Students and educators view education as a public good available to all and will continue mobilizing to restore funding for public education. Will they receive support or will education become a luxury available to fewer and fewer people? The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Katynka Z. Martínez.","Katynka Z.

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican authorities deployed more than 1,000 additional police officers to reinforce security at the capital's 175 subway stations on Saturday, a day after a shooting inside a station left two people dead and eight injured at the height of evening rush hour. Camera footage shows Luis Felipe Hernandez Castillo brandishing a gun. The shooting at the Balderas station in central Mexico City happened after police stopped Luis Felipe Hernandez Castillo, 38, from writing graffiti on the wall of one of the subway platforms. Five of the injured suffered gunshot wounds, and three others were hurt by the stampeding crowds, officials said. Hernandez Castillo was writing ""Este gobierno de criminales,"" or ""this government of criminals,"" Mexico City district attorney Miguel Angel Mancera said. As police tried to stop him, Hernandez Castillo drew a .38 special handgun and began firing. Mancera said his first impression of Hernandez Castillo is that he may suffer from mental illness. ""One moment he is talking about global warming and then about the message of the Bible and suddenly he focuses on some government,"" Mancera said. Authorities identified Hernandez Castillo as an agriculturalist from the state of Jalisco. Hernandez Castillo also told investigators that he believed a great famine would come, and he traveled to Mexico City to relay a message, Mancera said. Earlier this month, a Bolivian pastor hijacked a passenger jet in Mexico City with a fake bomb, claiming that he acted on a divine revelation to warn people of a forthcoming earthquake. Mancera said Hernandez Castillo was aware of the hijacking, but that the two events were not connected. Hernandez Castillo said he opened fire because he saw the police as a threat to his task of writing on the wall, Mancera said. Preliminary tests show that Hernandez Castillo was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs during the incident, Mancera said. The Mexican government on Saturday posted security camera footage of the shooting. It shows a busy subway platform as the train pulls into the station just before 5:15 p.m. Friday. As the train comes to a stop, there is a disturbance in the crowd, and Hernandez Castillo is seen shooting at an officer.  Watch the dramatic incident unfold » . The crowd disperses, and the officer runs out of view of the camera. The officer, who was a bank policeman, is later seen on the footage lying dead, face down on the platform. Authorities identified the officer as Victor Manuel Miranda Martinez. The footage shows a man in a white shirt running off the train and trying to wrestle Hernandez Castillo. The man chases Hernandez Castillo around the platform. He frequently falls either because he slips or is trying to avoid being shot. The man is on the floor facing Hernandez Castillo, about to get up and try to grab him, when he is shot in the head and falls to the ground. Mancera initially said the man was a federal security agent in plain clothes, but later clarified that the man was a civilian, a 58-year-old construction worker. A scattered handful of people remain on the subway platform during the shooting. Some stay on the train. Others walk on the platform very close to the shooter, seemingly undisturbed. Seven minutes later, the camera pans out to show the construction worker lying on his back and the bank police officer in the foreground. Hernandez Castillo remains on the train, occasionally firing his gun and peeking out of the train. At 5:23 p.m., the camera shows first one, then two, then three plain-clothes police getting into position on the platform. Within moments they rush Hernandez Castillo and pull him out of the train, with nearly a dozen police officers then wrestling him to the ground. Hernandez Castillo was treated at a hospital for a bullet wound to the right shoulder before being transferred to the local attorney general's office, a common place to hold prisoners during preliminary investigations, a spokesman for the attorney general said. He faces two counts of murder and one count each of attempted murder, aggression, resisting arrest and disturbing the peace, said the spokesman, who declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the press. CNN's Esprit Smith in Atlanta, Georgia, contributed to this report.","Shooting took place at the Balderas station in central Mexico City .

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- Nearly two dozen Americans -- most thought to work for the CIA -- were sentenced to five years in prison Wednesday by an Italian court for their role in the seizing of a suspected terrorist in Italy in 2003, the prosecutor in the case told CNN. The Americans did not appear for trial and are not in custody, but the ruling could effectively make them international fugitives. The trial was the first to deal with a practice that human rights groups call ""extraordinary rendition."" They say the United States has often sent suspects to countries that practice torture. Washington acknowledges making secret ""rendition"" transfers of terrorism suspects between countries but denies using torture or handing suspects over to countries that do. The case centered on the extraordinary rendition of a Muslim cleric, Osama Mustafa Hassan Nasr, or Abu Omar. He was seized on the streets of Milan, Italy, in 2003, transferred to Egypt and tortured, he said. He was suspected of recruiting men to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan and was under heavy surveillance by Italy's intelligence agency. Prosecutors said he was nabbed by a CIA team working with Italian intelligence officials. The verdict ""shows governments and institutions that the fight against terrorism has to be carried out in accordance with the law. There are no shortcuts,"" Spataro told CNN. Those who were found guilty were ordered to pay Abu Omar 1 million euros ($1.48 million) and his wife 500,000 euros. A total of 22 Americans were each sentenced to five years in prison for their role in his abduction. Another -- Robert Seldon Lady, whom prosecutors said was the CIA station chief in Milan -- was sentenced to eight years in jail, prosecutor Armando Spataro told CNN. Cases were dismissed against three other Americans, including Jeff Castelli, the man assumed to be the CIA station chief in Rome at the time, because they had diplomatic immunity from prosecution. Spataro said he may appeal that ruling. Cases were also dismissed against the former head of Italy's intelligence service and his deputy because of state secrecy provisions. Two other Italians were sentenced to three years in jail for aiding the plot. Sabrina De Sousa, one of the American defendants, was ""saddened, angered and dismayed"" by the ruling, her lawyer told CNN. She felt the U.S. government had ""stabbed her in the back,"" Mark Zaid said. ""We understand why the Italians did what they did. They were following their laws. But at the end of the day, representatives of our United States government abroad were let down and left alone by their own government."" De Sousa, a career diplomat, is suing the State Department over the case, Zaid confirmed. She has never said she worked for the CIA. CIA spokesman George Little said Wednesday: ""The CIA has not commented on any of the allegations surrounding Abu Omar."" But U.S. officials confirmed to CNN when the case first broke that the CIA was involved in the rendition of Abu Omar from Italy to Egypt. The officials never disclosed the number of Americans involved or their names. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell responded to the verdict as it applied to an Air Force officer, Lt. Col. Joseph Romano III, who was among the Americans sentenced. The Pentagon had asserted jurisdiction over the incident under the NATO Status of Forces Agreement, a position that the Italian minister of justice supported, Morrell said. ""We are clearly disappointed by the court's ruling,"" Morrell said. ""Our view is that the Italian court has no jurisdiction over Lt. Col. Romano and should have immediately dismissed the charges."" The American Civil Liberties Union, a persistent critic of Washington's extraordinary rendition program, demanded the United States match Italy's actions. ""The decision in Italy underscores the need for the United States to hold its own officials accountable for crimes committed under the 'extraordinary rendition' program. It is shameful that the first convictions of this kind came from a foreign justice system, where those convicted are not likely to serve their time,"" said Steven Watt, staff attorney for the ACLU Human Rights Program. Italian authorities originally indicted 26 Americans and five Italians in 2007 for kidnapping in the matter. The Italians included the former head of Italian intelligence, Nicolo Pollari, and one of his deputies. They testified in preliminary hearings that Italian intelligence played no role in the alleged abduction. None of the Americans is in custody in Italy and the Italian government did not ask for their extradition; they were tried in absentia. Former CIA analyst Michael Scheuer told CNN in the past that the Italian military secret service had approved the operation involving Hassan, and CIA sources who refused to be named told CNN in 2005 that the agency had briefed and sought approval from its Italian counterpart for such an abduction. The Italian government of the day -- which was led by Silvio Berlusconi -- vigorously denied having authorized Hassan's kidnapping, which it called illegal. Berlusconi has since returned to power.

"Montevideo, Uruguay (CNN) -- Jose ""Pepe"" Mujica, a former Marxist Tupamaro guerrilla fighter, won Uruguay's presidential runoff election Sunday, exit polls showed. Exit polls had Mujica defeating former president Luis Alberto Lacalle by a margin of 4 to 8 percentage points. Current Uruguayan President Tabare Vazquez confirmed the projection to reporters Sunday evening, and Lacalle conceded in a speech. The streets of the South American country's capital were filled with Mujica's supporters, who cheered and honked their horns. Mujica belongs to the same Broad Front Party as Vazquez, who is popular. Both men are considered leftists. Lacalle is considered more conservative. In a victory speech, Mujica said his administration will continue the policies of Vazquez. ""Tomorrow, the commitment continues,"" he said. Mujica, 74, was imprisoned for 14 years and released in 1985 when democracy was restored to Uruguay after a 17-year dictatorship. He was minister of livestock and agriculture from 2005 to 2008 and is now a senator. Mujica has played down his connection with the Tupamaros, who were defeated in 1973. In his victory speech Sunday, Mujica called for unity and asked his followers not to offend those who voted for other candidates during the first and second rounds of voting. His administration may make mistakes, but it will never turn its back to the problems facing the country, Mujica said. ""He is the man who talks and dresses austerely,"" analyst Gabriel Pereyra said of Mujica. ""He is the man who communicates and talks the language of the people."" Analyst Rosario Queirolo describes Mujica as ""a person who somehow lives what he preaches and is an antipolitician in another way."" ""He doesn't very well fit the image of a president we have in Uruguay,"" Queirolo said. Uruguay is one of the smallest countries in South America, about the size of Washington state. But it is also considered one of the most economically developed. Located on South America's southeastern coast, the country has a population of 3.5 million, 92 percent of whom live in urban areas.

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN)  -- The death toll from weekend violence in central Nigeria climbed to more than 200 Monday after members of a machete-wielding Muslim group attacked a mostly Christian town south of the city of Jos, officials said. More than 200 were dead and 32 injured, according to Choji Gyang, a religious affairs adviser to the head of Plateau state, who said bodies were still being recovered. Sani Shehu, president of the nongovernmental agency Civil Rights Congress, put the number of dead at about 485 people. Twenty-six arrests had been made in connection with the violence, Gyang said. Nigerian Vice President Goodluck Jonathan put security on high alert Sunday and began operations to capture the ""roving bands of killers"" who attacked Dogo Nahauwa, a town just south of Jos. Are you there? Send your video, images to iReport . The townsfolk are predominantly Berom, an ethnic group that mostly practices Christianity, said Manase Pampe, spokesman for the Red Cross Plateau state office. Reports of the attack described the assailants as members of the Muslim Hausa-Fulani ethnic group, Pampe and government spokesman Gregory Yenlong said. The attackers stormed the town at 3 a.m. Sunday (9 p.m. Saturday ET) and remained there for 2½ hours, Pampe said. Buildings were set afire, and people were attacked with machetes, Yenlong said. The violence resembled previous outbreaks of ethno-religious clashes in the West African nation. But John Onaiyekan, archbishop of Abuja, told Vatican Radio the most recent outbreak is the result of a dispute over access to natural resources, not religion. ""The point that needs to be made is that people are not killing one another because of religion,"" Onaiyekan said. Instead, he called it a ""classical"" economic conflict between farmers and less sedentary groups. The Plateau attack prompted Jonathan to place the area and neighboring states on ""red alert,"" the vice president's office said in a news release. He directed security forces to ""undertake strategic initiatives to confront and defeat these roving bands of killers,"" the office said. Jonathan, who became acting head of state in February while President Umaru Yar'Adua recovers from illness, called for calm. ""He calls on all Nigerians to remain peaceful and law abiding since violence only begets further violence,"" the release said. ""He also sympathizes with those who have lost relatives and friends in these attacks, asking the Almighty to grant them the fortitude to bear the loss."" Onaiyekan said the government had imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew but noted it's difficult for authorities to impose curfews outside the cities. The recent casualties don't ""say much about the ability of government to defend its citizens,"" he said. Hundreds fled the town as the violence raged Sunday. The Red Cross was caring for about 600 people at its camp in Boto in Bauchi state, said Alhaji Abubakar, the group's spokesman in the state. Bauchi is just north of Plateau state. Forty-eight people were treated at hospitals, national Red Cross spokesman Umar Maigari said. Red Cross officials counted 30 bodies in one community but were unable to continue their investigation, he said. Residents wanted to direct the attention to burying the dead, he said. Nigeria -- with more than 150 million people -- is the most populous country in Africa and almost evenly divided between Muslims and Christians. It has the sixth-largest Islamic population in the world -- 78 million-plus Muslims, according to a study last year by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. While some outbursts of violence are between Christians and Muslims, some disputes are also ethnic-based. The country is home to 250 to 400 ethnic groups, making it one of the most diverse African nations, according to the International Displacement Monitoring Center. Thousands were displaced in January when violence flared up in Jos, said Shehu of the Civil Rights Congress. A local activist said 69 people were killed and about 600 injured. Also in January, at least 150 Muslims were killed during an attack in Kuru Karama south of Jos, Human Rights Watch reported. Community leaders from Jos and journalists told Human Rights Watch they saw dozens of bodies lodged in wells or sewage pits. Most of the town's homes were burned, the group said. In November 2008, at least 700 Nigerians died in Christian-Muslim riots that followed a disputed local election, Human Rights Watch reported.

"(CNN) -- Snow Leopard, the highly anticipated new operating system for the Mac, will be released ahead of schedule Friday, Apple announced Monday. ""Ordered already: I'm just one of those nut cases,"" one Twitter user wrote about the new release. The Mac OS X Snow Leopard will be available as an upgrade to the current Leopard system for $29 and can be pre-ordered now, the company said. ""Snow Leopard builds on our most successful operating system ever, and we're happy to get it to users earlier than expected,"" said Bertrand Serlet, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering. ""For just $29, Leopard users get a smooth upgrade to the world's most advanced operating system and the only system with built-in [Microsoft] Exchange support."" The company said in a news release that, for Snow Leopard, Apple engineers refined 90 percent of the 1,000 projects that currently make up its operating system. Among the anticipated features will be what Apple promises to be faster applications, including e-mail and Web browser Safari 4, while freeing up 7 GB of drive space, compared with the current system. An upgraded QuickTime system will let users more easily view, record, trim and share video, the company said, and it will include improvements to the system's iCal calendar, podcast producer and wiki server. The system had been scheduled for a September release date. But speculation in recent days had centered on an earlier release. Apple rival Microsoft is set to release Windows 7, a new version of its PC operating system, on October 22. Mac users were reporting that Apple's online stores were unavailable Monday morning, presumably to add the order page for Snow Leopard. The announcement Monday created the buzz typical of any Apple announcement among the world of devoted Mac users. Both ""Snow Leopard"" and ""Mac OS X Snow"" had become trending topics on Twitter on Monday morning -- with response mostly positive.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Cuba is wrapping up its biggest military exercises in five years, saying it wants to be prepared in the event of a U.S. invasion. Under the watchful eye of Cuban President Raul Castro, the armed forces is ending four days of extensive maneuvers, war-room strategy sessions and military parades across the island. ""This is a necessity of the first order,"" Gen. Leonardo Andollo Valdez said on state television. ""The political, military situation, which characterizes the confrontation between our country and the empire, can go from a relatively normal situation to a much more urgent, confrontational, aggressive one in a month, a week, or even in a night,"" he added. Cuban television broadcast images of camouflaged troops firing from trenches and fighter aircraft dropping bombs. Many of the images are from exercises in previous years. The exercises come amid a slight thaw in relations between the Cold War enemies. President Obama has lifted restrictions on Cuban-American travel and remittances, and the two countries have resumed immigration talks. Obama recently said the United States has no intention of invading the communist island just 90 miles off its coast. But the fear of an attack has been a constant concern here, and not without reason. In 1961, Washington backed an invasion by Cuban exiles bent on overthrowing Fidel Castro, the brother of Raul Castro and former president of Cuba. They were defeated at the Bay of Pigs, but the United States has maintained an economic embargo, and Fidel Castro has survived numerous attempts on his life. The massive military exercises began in 1980 and have been repeated every few years. The latest maneuvers, called ""Bastion 2009,"" are the first since Raul Castro succeeded his brother and Obama assumed the White House. Preparations for the exercises began in 2004, before either was in office. The exercises end Saturday, and on Sunday, Cuba will celebrate Day of Defense.","Nation wrapping up its biggest military exercises in five years .

"(CNN) -- Troops in the southern Philippines early Sunday took advantage of martial law to hunt down those believed responsible for last week's killings there. President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo declared martial law in the southern province of Maguindanao after 57 people were killed in politically motivated violence. Maj. Randolph Cabangbang, deputy of operations for the Eastern Mindanao command, told CNN on Saturday that searchers have made arrests and recovered firearms and vehicles from a clan implicated in the killings. He said local residents welcome the deployment of the troops. ""We need this because we do not want those who perpetrated the crime to slip out of the province. And we may be having a hard time catching them,"" he said. Army spokesman Lt. Col. Romeo Brawner Jr. said martial law -- under which police can make arrests without a warrant -- went into effect at 9 p.m. Congress would have to approve any extension beyond 60 days. Brawner said the measure was invoked to impose peace on the region after the unrest, which led to troops being mobilized. ""Life is to resume normally and martial law is established to prevent new violence, with troops on the ground monitoring any possible violence breakout,"" he said. ""But the civilian government will be running the affairs of the province, not a military governor."" Military police have detained three brothers and their father on suspicion of involvement in the unrest: Akmad Ampatuan, the vice governor of Maguindanao; Anwar Ampatuan, the mayor of Sherif Auguak, Maguindanao's capital; and Zaldy Ampatuan, governor of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao. Andal Ampatuan Sr., the patriarch, became ill and was hospitalized after he, too, was taken in. ""Local government will function, it will prevent armed groups from wreaking havoc ... and it will allow the officials search and find the guilty parties,"" Brawner said. Security forces on Friday searched the home of Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay and son of the provincial governor of Maguindanao, according to Brawner. Authorities say Andal Ampatuan Jr. directed the Nov. 23 politically motivated killings. Weapons were found in the house, Brawner said. On Tuesday, Philippine authorities charged Ampatuan and other suspects with 25 counts of murder in the killings. Still more suspects were taken into custody Friday. The Philippine military is investigating its own forces in connection with the case as well, Brawner said. The National Bureau of Investigation has moved a third witness to Manila for questioning, the Philippines News Agency reported Thursday. ""At the moment, we are interviewing the witness so that we would know what he knows about the incident in Maguindanao,"" NBI Director Nestor Mantaring said. The witness claimed to have been at the site during the massacre. ""He is very vital,"" Mantaring said. ""From what I know ... he knows a lot of information regarding the incident."" Among the victims in the massacre were the wife and sister of political candidate Ismael ""Toto"" Mangudadatu, who had sent the women to file paperwork allowing him to run for governor of Maguindanao. He said he had received threats from allies of Gov. Andal Ampatuan, the father of the accused mayor, saying he would be kidnapped if he filed the papers himself. Witnesses and local officials have blamed the younger Ampatuan, a longtime ally of the Philippines president and a known warlord. They said the killings were an attempt to block Mangudadatu from challenging him in the May gubernatorial election. Also killed were a dozen journalists who had accompanied the women. Group: Philippines most dangerous country for journalists . Asked why martial law was imposed 12 days after the killings, Cabangbang said authorities ""were trying to build a case -- a tight case"" against suspects. ""But it is taking long to build a case, so I think the government gave us a free hand in arresting those who are suspects, and allowed us to search, even without warrant. So we really need this declaration of state of martial law."" Violence in the run-up to elections is not uncommon in the Philippines. The Maguindanao massacre, however, is the worst politically motivated violence in recent Philippine history, according to state media. Maguindanao is part of an autonomous region in predominantly Muslim Mindanao, which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the predominantly Christian Asian nation. Suspicion fell on Ampatuan after a government construction vehicle was found at the hastily dug mass grave that held the bodies of the massacre victims.

"Moscow, Russia (CNN)  -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin sent a strong signal Thursday that he has full hands-on control of his country. As part of his annual town hall forum, Putin spoke for four hours and fielded 80 questions out of 2 million-plus submitted on a live call-in program, ""Conversation With Vladimir Putin -- Continued."" Responding to a question on whether he had any plans to retire and enjoy the life of an ordinary citizen, Putin tersely replied, ""Don't count on that."" And when asked whether he plans to run for the presidency again in 2012, he said, ""I will think about it. There is plenty of time for that."" Speaking of his ""tandem"" with President Dmitry Medvedev, Putin said he had ""known him for many years, graduated from the same universities, having been taught by the same professors."" ""Those common principles allow us to effectively work together,"" he said, responding to the never-ending speculation about which one of the duo is more important and whether a rift between them is possible. Putin juggled a myriad of facts and statistics, giving instructions to subordinates along the way to fix problems, as he responded to questions mostly on Russia's domestic issues. These covered pensions, medication prices, the overhauling of entire industries and Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization, Amur tigers and hip-hop music, and everything in between. The program was broadcast live on government television and radio. It marked Putin's eighth annual year-end ""town meeting,"" first launched in 2001 when he was president. This year's forum was his second as prime minister. Representatives from all Russian industries as well as university students packed the auditorium in Gostiny Dvor, a large conference hall next door to the Kremlin, where Putin appeared. Putin took questions from the hall's floor, with live cameras positioned in towns and cities across Russia, and he also responded to phone calls, e-mails and mobile SMS messages. He started off by addressing the issue of terrorism, coming nearly a week after the derailment of a luxury Moscow-St.Petersburg express train, which left 26 people dead and more than 100 injured. Russia's Federal Security Service said an improvised explosive device, which unknown bombers placed beneath the railroad bed, caused Friday's derailment. It was the biggest terror act outside Russia's troubled North Caucasus region since 2004. ""We did a lot [in recent years] to break the backbone of terrorism, but the threat has not been eliminated yet,"" Putin said. ""The entire society, each of us, should be conscious of this threat and be vigilant."" Addressing the economy, Putin said the peak of the global economic crisis has passed, ""although turbulent trends in the global and, as a result, the Russian economy, are still in place."" ""It will take time and effort to overcome the crisis,"" he said. The past year has been ""one of the most difficult"" for Russia in this decade, Putin added, saying the 2009 gross domestic product will shrink by 8.5 percent to 8.7 percent. The slump in the country's industry will be even bigger, he said, around 13 percent, but the projected inflation for 2009 will be lower than in the past year, about 9 percent. The prime minister also cited what he called ""positive developments"" in the Russian economy. He said some industries, such as military hardware production and agriculture, are even growing. In the arena of international politics, Putin told a questioner that he and former President George W. Bush had a good relationship but have not been in touch. The prime minister described Bush as a ""very honest and nice person,"" saying that if the ex-U.S. leader wanted to continue their relationship, he would be glad to do so. Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said the wide range of issues on which Russians posed questions ""provides an excellent instrument for sociological study, and all questions that are being raised, are carefully studied. That [call-in show] gives a very reliable sociological survey."" Putin's popularity ratings at home demonstrates his political dominance in Russia. Confidence in the prime minister stood at 70 percent, as opposed to 59 percent for Medvedev, according to a recently published opinion poll conducted by Russia's Public Opinion Foundation. While Putin had his town hall forum, Medvedev was holding meetings in Italy with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Pope Benedict XVI.","Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin dismisses notion of retiring at town hall forum .

"(CNN) -- A registered sex offender has been indicted on 85 counts -- including aggravated murder, rape and kidnapping -- in the deaths of 11 women whose bodies were found at his home, authorities said Tuesday. In addition, Anthony Sowell, 50, is charged with ""brutalizing"" three women and raping two of them, Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Bill Mason said. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Sowell, Mason said. Sowell is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday. Sowell is now charged with 11 counts of aggravated murder with a ""mass murder specification,"" meaning multiple people were killed in a similar fashion, Mason said. He also is charged with abuse of a corpse, kidnapping and tampering with evidence. The indictment also alleges that Sowell assaulted women on December 8, 2008, and on September 22 and October 20 of this year. The September and October victims were raped, and the other woman was punched and choked before she escaped, Mason said. Sowell's charges in the incidents include attempted murder, rape or attempted rape, kidnapping, robbery and felonious assault. Sowell already faced charges in the September 22 rape and has pleaded not guilty. On October 20, neighbors reported seeing a naked woman fall from the second floor of his house. Firefighters responded and later notified police. But the woman told officers she fell off the roof while she was at the home ""partying,"" police said earlier. No charges were filed at the time. Mason said, however, that the 51-year-old woman had been invited to Sowell's home and left, but was lured back in. After being choked and raped, she attempted to escape out a second-floor window as Sowell tried to pull her back in. When he was unsuccessful, he pushed her out, and she lay unconscious in an alley for a while before he pulled her back in the house. Sowell threatened his victims and warned them not to contact police, Mason said. It's possible there are other victims, he said, and he urged anyone who has not come forward to do so. Sowell ""knew what he was doing was wrong at the time he was doing it,"" Mason said. As of last month, Sowell was on suicide watch at the request of his public defender, Kathleen DeMetz. She had said a psychiatric evaluation of Sowell had been ordered but was unlikely to happen until after an indictment was filed. Cuyahoga County Sheriff Bob Reid said Tuesday that Sowell has been a ""model prisoner,"" is kept in an isolated unit and has declined visitation requests. All of the 11 victims were African-American women, authorities have said. Most of them were strangled by ligature -- which could include a string, cord or wire -- and at least one was strangled by hand, officials said. Seven still had ligatures wrapped around their necks. All that has been found of one woman is a skull that was wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed into a bucket in the home's basement. Sowell served 15 years in prison for a 1989 attempted rape and was released in 2005. He was required to register as a sex offender. After the 11 victims were found, police in mid-November used thermal imaging in an attempt to see whether any additional human remains were on the property. They dug certain areas by hand. No more were found. Police and the FBI have said they are looking at the unsolved murders of three women in East Cleveland to determine whether there are similarities with the remains found at Sowell's home. The inquiry continues, Mason said Tuesday. Police in Coronado, California, have said they are attempting to determine whether Sowell is linked to a 1979 rape there. Though the statute of limitations has expired, authorities said they would like to provide closure to the victim. Neighbors and police have said that women were seen at Sowell's home from time to time and that he would offer them alcohol. Police said he also might have offered them drugs. In the September assault, the 36-year-old woman told police that she encountered Sowell while walking in his neighborhood and he took her back to his home, where he became violent and raped her, according to prosecutors. ""While raping her, he strangled her with a cord until she lost consciousness,"" authorities said in a statement. ""When she regained consciousness, he let her out of the house.""","NEW: Indictment includes 11 aggravated murder charges with ""mass murder specification""

"(CNN) -- David Headley, the Chicago, Illinois, man appearing in court Wednesday in connection with terror attacks in India, was born Daood Gilani, the son of a prominent Pakistani broadcaster, according to his half-brother. He grew up in both the United States and Pakistan, with a parent from each country. Headley's father, Syed Saleem Gilani, was working for the U.S.-government-funded Voice of America when Headley was born in 1960 in Washington, his half-brother Danyal Gilani said in a statement. Headley's mother was American, and his parents divorced after they moved to Pakistan together, not long after Headley was born, his half-brother said. He did not name the mother. His mother returned to the United States, but Headley remained in Pakistan, his half-brother said, citing ""family elders."" Headley went to high school at the Hassan Abdal Cadet College in Pakistan, Gilani and an FBI complaint against Headley indicate. At some point after high school, Headley moved back to the United States to be with his mother, and has had little contact with his Pakistani family since then, Gilani said. Gilani last saw Headley, whom he still refers to as Daood, ""when he visited Pakistan a few days after my father's death, nearly a year ago."" He got a Social Security number in Pennsylvania sometime in the late 1970s, public records show. He changed his name from Daood Gilani to David Headley on or about February 15, 2006, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in order to present himself in India as an American who was neither Muslim nor Pakistani, according to the criminal complaint against him. ""His having another name or changing his name at some stage in life has come as a surprise to me. He has four kids and a Pakistani wife who also live in the United States,"" said Danyal Gilani, a public relations officer for the Pakistani prime minister's office. He issued a long statement last month distancing himself from his half-brother, in response to reports in the Indian press trying to link Headley to Pakistan's prime minister, whose last name also is Gilani. But Danyal Gilani said his family was not related to the prime minister, Yousuf Raza Gilani. Headley was arrested by federal agents on October 3 in Chicago, accused of helping plan terror attacks against a Danish newspaper that ran cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, sparking Muslim anger worldwide. He was later linked to the bloody four-day terrorist siege in Mumbai, India, in November 2008 in which 160 people were killed. The Justice Department accuses him of attending terrorism training camps in Pakistan in 2002 and 2003, and working with the group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba to carry out terror attacks. The United States lists Lashkar as a terrorist organization. India blamed the group for the Mumbai attacks. At the time of his arrest October 3, Headley was on his way back to India to plan a second attack, a source close to the investigation said. Headley is cooperating with the authorities investigating both terror plots, the Justice Department has said. His lawyer did not dispute that. Abdur Rehman Hashim Syed, a retired major in the Pakistani military, was also charged with conspiracy in planning to attack the Danish newspaper. So was Tahawwur Hussain Rana, whom U.S. authorities identify as a Pakistani native and Canadian citizen who lives mainly in Chicago. Headley said he worked for First World Immigration Services, a company owned by Rana, though authorities have said in court papers that surveillance showed that he ""performs few services"" for the company. CNN's Reza Sayah in Islamabad, Pakistan, Terry Frieden in Washington, and Kathleen Johnston, Drew Griffin and Amy Roberts in Atlanta, Georgia, contributed to this report.","David Headley appeared in court Wednesday in connection with terror attacks in India .

UWIRE aims to identify and promote the brightest young content creators and deliver their work to a larger audience via professional media partners such as CNN.com. Visit UWIRE.com to learn more. (UWIRE) -- A Web site developed this year that allows students to share old exams online is causing debate among professors about its ethical implications. PostYourTest.com creator Demir Oral says the site is a tool for education, not for cheating. PostYourTest.com is an educational tool that lets students anonymously upload materials and tests from their previous and current classes, said Demir Oral, creator of the site. However, there are teachers who do not want their tests to be posted for every student to see. ""I would not be happy if a student who had taken a class of mine had taken an exam and posted it online,"" Sarah Hall, graduate professor of psychology at Penn State University, said. ""I know that some teachers reuse past exams and it would be hard to have to write a new test for every class."" However, Mary Bojan, professor of chemistry at PSU, said she wouldn't mind if students posted her tests online. ""For my classes I always write new exams every time, and I wouldn't object because I have some old exams up online that I've posted myself,"" Bojan said. Currently, there are no tests online for Penn State University, because the site was developed on the West Coast, Oral said. ""Primarily the main audience is San Diego, but that's because I've only advertised around there,"" Oral said. He said he is looking into expanding the site more to include universities and colleges across the country. ""Also, although I am still focused on the United States, in the future I would like to go global,"" Oral said. ""I think it would be really effective worldwide."" While studying for an exam in the HUB-Robeson Center, Christal Cozier (senior-nutrition) said she would consider using the site. ""I think looking at an old exam helps -- it at least gives the student an idea of how the teacher poses questions,"" Cozier said. While she said she wouldn't go through the trouble of posting a test herself, Cozier said she didn't think students posting old tests online would be a problem. ""Most teachers give out practice exams and old exams anyway,"" she said. ""The only time I would think it would be a problem is if the teacher uses exams more than once."" In response to criticism of the site from professors, Oral said he wants people to know the site is a tool for education and not a tool for cheating. He added teachers can ban their exams from the site if they don't want students sharing them online. ""The first professor that banned his exams said he wanted to ban them because he was copyrighting them and publishing them in a book, and that made total sense to me,"" Oral said. Even with the option to ban tests, Tara Chismar said professors may not know the site exists and may not know to ban their exams from it. She said the site might be OK only if students get permission from their teachers to post exams online. Bojan said the biggest problem she saw with students posting material online would be putting up tests the teachers wanted handed back in. ""Common sense needs to come into play with something like this because there's a student responsibility side to it,"" she said. ""Having access to an exam you're not supposed to is cheating."" Students shouldn't have to rely on old tests online to prepare for an exam from a new teacher, Hall said. ""There are likely a lot of professors who would be happy to give students more of a sense of what the exam is going to be like -- maybe giving them sample questions,"" she said. Bojan warned students should use materials posted online wisely because looking at an exam may not always be the best way to study. ""One problem is old tests may not be the most effective study tool,"" she said. ""By just going off of old exams students aren't learning how to actually do the problems.""","PostYourTest.com was developed this year, has mostly California tests .

"(CNN) -- The news was devastating, the aftermath surreal. Diena Thompson clutched a tissue in her right hand, frequently wiping her eyes as she told reporters that she couldn't believe it was her daughter whose body was found in a Georgia landfill. Her visage revealed the weight of grief and a yearning for justice. Standing outside her home in Orange Park, Florida, Thompson looked into the camera and, with her voice cracking, sent out a stern warning to her daughter's killer. ""I want you to know that I will not sleep until this person is found. I hope they get you, and I hope they make you pay for a long, long time. You don't take from somebody. You didn't just take her from me. You took her from my family; you took her from all these people. And you don't do this to a little baby and put my baby in the trash like she's nothing. That's not OK, this is not OK."" The body of her daughter, 7-year-old Somer Thompson, was found in a South Georgia landfill, Clay County, Florida, Sheriff Rick Beseler said Thursday. On Monday, Somer became separated from her siblings and schoolmates on her way home from school in Orange Park. She was seen in a fight at school before disappearing, according to a police report Thursday. Her 10-year-old sister told police that Somer had gotten into a fight with another girl at school earlier in the day. The sister said she brought up the fight while she and her brother walked Somer home from school, and that Somer ran off from them, apparently upset. The sister said she lost sight of Somer in a group of other kids leaving the school, according to the police report. A medical examiner in Savannah, Georgia, used dental records to identify the body positively as Somer's, said Clay County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Mary Justino. The sheriff told the girl's mother Wednesday night that her daughter had been identified. Thompson was devastated, he said. ""It was the hardest phone call I've ever had to make in my life, and I hope I never have to make another one like that,"" Beseler said at a Thursday news conference. Authorities are turning their full attention to finding the child's killer. The landfill where her body was found is near Folkston, Georgia, 55 miles north of where the girl became separated from her schoolmates.  Authorities will work to pinpoint where the garbage load that contained the girl's body came from, Beseler said. The garbage brought into that part of the landfill was collected in the Orange Park area, he has said, noting that authorities routinely search garbage when a missing person case has been initiated. The investigation has turned into a murder probe. ""There is a child killer on the loose,"" the sheriff said. ""I fear for our community until we bring this person in."" Investigators in Georgia are combing through a ""tremendous mountain"" of garbage at the landfill, searching for clues, said Justino, the sheriff's office spokeswoman, on Friday. Some possible evidence has been removed from the landfill, but authorities won't describe what they found, Justino said. Police have no suspects, she said. She said other law enforcement teams are focusing on the locale where the child apparently was last seen. Justino said witnesses, including some children, saw her on the sidewalk in front of a vacant house under renovation after a fire. ""Since Monday, we have been trying to figure out who frequents that area,"" including anyone working on the home, she said. Rewards totaling $30,000 have been offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of whoever is responsible. Justino said of the 810 leads called in to a tip line, 231 were being actively pursued by a group of 50 detectives. Overnight, detectives finished interviewing 90 registered sex offenders or predators within a five-mile radius of the Thompson home, the spokeswoman said. Somer's family was making funeral arrangements Friday, Justino said, and many in the community had offered to help financially. ""There has been an outpouring of support from the community,"" she said. CNN's Maria P. White contributed to this report.","Body found in landfill identified as Somer Thompson, using dental records .

"(CNN) -- Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee on Tuesday said he accepts ""full responsibility"" for granting clemency in 2000 to a man authorities say gunned down four Lakewood, Washington, police officers Sunday. Maurice Clemmons, 37, was shot and killed early Tuesday by Seattle police. He was the subject of a two-day manhunt after the four officers were killed at a coffee shop as they met before their shifts began Sunday morning. Clemmons had a criminal history in Arkansas and Washington. In May 2000, Huckabee commuted his 108-year prison sentence to make him immediately eligible for parole, which was granted by the parole board two months later. Clemmons had been sentenced to 95 years, to run after time he was already serving on previous convictions. In a statement on the conservative news Web site Newsmax.com, Huckabee wrote that he commuted Clemmons' sentence from 108 years to 47 years. Reports that he had pardoned Clemmons or set him free were erroneous, he said. ""I take full responsibility for my actions of nine years ago,"" Huckabee said. ""I acted on the facts presented to me in 2000. If I could have possibly known what Clemmons would do nine years later, I obviously would have made a different decision. But if the same file was presented to me today, I would have likely made the same decision."" But the Arkansas prosecutor who put Clemmons behind bars told CNN on Tuesday that Huckabee was issuing clemency at ""an astounding rate"" during his tenure as governor. ""He was exercising the clemency power at what I call a wholesale rate,"" Larry Jegley said. ""He was letting murderers out, he was letting rapists out, and he was letting the likes of Mr. Clemmons out."" One survey, he said, showed Huckabee issued more clemencies from 1996 to 2004 than the governors of all six surrounding states, including Texas. He said he didn't know why so many clemencies were granted. ""That was part of the frustration that we felt with the entire process. ... We never felt as though he gave victims, their families, jurors, law enforcement and the community in general an adequate explanation as to why he felt compelled to let people of proven danger go in our community."" Huckabee was a Republican presidential candidate in the 2008 election and has not ruled out another White House bid in 2012. During his 2008 campaign, he was criticized for granting clemency to another inmate, convicted rapist Wayne DuMond, who was later convicted of raping and murdering a woman in Missouri. ""Between 1,000 and 2,000 requests for some form of clemency came to my desk each and every one of the 10½ years I was governor,"" Huckabee said Tuesday. ""Ninety-two percent of the time, I denied the requests."" He noted that in Arkansas, a governor does not initiate a sentence change -- the Post Prison Transfer Board makes a recommendation to the governor after reviewing an inmate's file. The governor then can grant or deny it. Clemmons was 16 when he was charged with robbery and burglary. ""For the crimes he committed and the age at which he committed the crimes, [a 108-year sentence] was dramatically outside the norm for sentencing,"" Huckabee said. The board unanimously recommended that the sentence be commuted. Jegley said that while in prison in Arkansas, Clemmons had a disciplinary record for violent incidents, and that something should have tipped off the board or the governor that ""this man was not a good candidate to be put back in society, because he couldn't live in the cloistered environment of prison and stay out of trouble."" Watch what Jegley has to say . In the case of any form of clemency -- a commutation or a full pardon -- notice is given to the prosecutor, the judge, law enforcement officials, the attorney general and the secretary of state, as well as the media, for a public response period, Huckabee said. ""The only record of public response to the notice to commute was from the trial judge, who recommended the commendation in concert with the board."" Jegley told CNN he was not notified of the commutation, but he doesn't ""attribute that to something sinister. ... I just think that maybe the system fouled up and didn't get notification out to all the parties who were interested in it, my office included."" Clemmons was returned to prison after violating his parole, Huckabee said. He ""should have stayed there. For reasons only the prosecutor can explain, charges were not brought forth in a timely way and the prosecutor ended up dropping the charges, allowing him to leave prison and return to supervised parole."" He noted that Clemmons, who had been picked up again in Pierce County, Washington, was released on bail there only days before the officers were slain. ""I can't explain why he wasn't prosecuted properly for the parole violations or why he was allowed to make bail in Washington state and not incarcerated earlier for crimes committed there,"" the former governor wrote. On Sunday, Huckabee's office issued a statement saying that if Clemmons was ""found responsible for this horrible tragedy, it will be the result of a series of failures in the criminal justice system in both Arkansas and Washington state."" Police responded sharply to that statement. ""We're disappointed that Governor Huckabee came out in the middle of the night without calling anybody here and blamed this on the criminal justice system in the state of Washington,"" Pierce County Sheriff's Department spokesman Ed Troyer said. ""We're guessing that's probably a spin doctor, not him."" Huckabee wrote of Clemmons, ""I wish his file had never crossed my desk, but it did. The decision I made is one that I now wish were different, but I could only look backwards at his case, not forward. None of this is of any comfort to the families of these police officers, nor should it be. Their loss is senseless. ... Our system is not perfect, and neither are those responsible for administering it. ""The system, and those of us who are supposed to make sure it works, sometimes fail,"" Huckabee said. ""In this case, we clearly did.""","Man accused of killing 4 Washington officers had criminal history in Arkansas, Washington .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A Fort Drum soldier has been arrested in the deaths of two fellow soldiers found stabbed in an apartment near the upstate New York military base, the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office said. The suspect, Joshua Hunter, 20, is being held at an undisclosed location in Ohio after being charged with two counts of second degree murder, Undersheriff Tim Dowe told CNN. The sheriff's office identified the victims as Spc. Waide T. James, 20, of Cocoa, Florida, and Spc. Diego A. Valbuena, 23, of Port St. Lucie, Florida. The two men were found dead with multiple stab wounds Tuesday in an apartment at Meadowbrook Apartments in LeRay, New York, Dowe said. The complex houses mostly military families near the main entrance of Fort Drum, he said. The motive is unknown at this time, Dowe said. Sheriff's deputies were called to the apartment complex after the soldiers were reported missing for duty, but the sheriff's office could not say when that report was filed. James and Valbuena, who joined the Army in 2007, worked as motor transport operators with the Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, 10th Mountain Division, according to a Fort Drum press release. Both had served in Iraq, it said. Police and Fort Drum officials would not release information about the suspect, including his rank or relationship to the victims.

"(CNN) -- Soupy Sales, a comedian from the golden era of television, died Thursday. He was 83. The funny man seen many times on popular game shows died at a New York hospice, said Paul Dver, Sales' longtime friend and manager. ""We have lost a comedy American icon,"" Dver said. ""I feel the personal loss, and I also feel the magic that he had around him being gone. That's a much more severe loss than a loss of a friend."" Sales was known for his long-running children's show ""Lunch With Soupy Sales,"" which started in 1953 and began his trademark slapstick pie-throwing antics. The comedy show featured skits that culminated in Sales getting walloped with pies in the face. What are your memories of Sales? ""Soupy was the last of the great TV comics when you talk about Ernie Kovacs, Red Skelton, right down to Howdy Doody,"" Dver said. ""But it was bigger than that, because he used a children's format aimed at the kids and then he would forget he was doing a kids' show and do a wild, unrehearsed, wacky improv for a half-hour every day for 15 years."" He could also inflame the authorities. One New Year's Day, upset at being asked to work, he asked his youthful audience to send him those ""green pieces of paper"" from their parents' wallets. Though he didn't receive much -- he told The New York Times he received only a few dollars -- he was suspended for a week for the prank. Later in his career, he was a regular on TV game shows, such as ""Hollywood Squares,"" ""To Tell the Truth"" and ""What's My Line?"" Sales recently fell backstage at a local Emmy awards show in New York and developed serious ailments after that, Dver said.","""We have lost a comedy American icon,"" says comedian's friend and manager .

"Washington (CNN) -- Justice Antonin Scalia is a conservative in thought, but not in personality. A new biography of the colorful Supreme Court jurist paints a complete picture of his enormous ongoing influence on the law and society. ""American Original: The Life and Constitution of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia"" (Farrar, Straus, Giroux) offers the first comprehensive look at the first Italian-American on the high court, and the rhetorical battles he has waged on the court and off. CNN spoke with Joan Biskupic, the book's author, who also is a reporter for USA Today. Biskupic has covered the high court for two decades, holds a law degree from Georgetown University and has also written a biography of Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. CNN: Justice Scalia has a certain public image in the minds of many Americans. You've known him for years and interviewed him several times for this book. Is he the same in private? Biskupic: He's a lot more of himself in private. He actually is very confrontational behind the scenes, just as he is in public. He's very defiant. But he also can be quite funny, quite casual, generous and decent. His best friend on the bench is Justice [Ruth Bader] Ginsburg [a low-key, liberal justice but, like Scalia, a native New Yorker who loves opera]. He's many things. He's very consistent on the law, but he's a lot of things in terms of his personality. CNN: He has told me that one of the happiest times in his career was in the executive branch, where he said that's where the action was, instead of serving on the bench. Biskupic: Remember what it was like working in the [Department of Justice's] Office of Legal Counsel in the post-Watergate era [in the Nixon and Ford administrations]. It was an exciting job for him, there was a lot of tension, and conflicts with the legislative branch. He really thrived on that. At a time when many Republican lawyers were trying to get out of the Nixon administration, as Watergate was moving to a climax, he was trying to move up and be promoted. He sparred with Democratic lawmakers, and was trying to exert executive privilege claims, when that was a dirty word in the wake of Watergate. CNN: Growing up, you describe ""Nino"" -- as his friends and family call him -- as something of a golden child. Biskupic: I'd always known he was an only child, who, interestingly, later went on to have nine children, but I didn't know he was the only offspring of his generation from two immigrant Italian families. For his parents and his aunts and uncles, he was the center of their universe, but it put a burden on him to perform, to be this special child. I found the conflicts in terms of being a product of two different families continue to reveal himself. The father was quite cerebral, was a professor, always had his nose in a book, he didn't abide any kind of silliness. And his mother's side was much more flamboyant. You had these contrasting families, and, as I write in the book, he learned to deal with conflict and tension early on in his life, and went on to readily generate it as an adult. CNN: Many conservatives worship Scalia, and yet you suggest his influence has not had as far-reaching an effect inside the high court as many believe it to be. How do his colleagues view him? Biskupic: I talked to his colleagues about where he's at. Justice [John Paul] Stevens says he is committed -- some of his impact made a huge difference, some of it unfortunate. Stevens, the senior liberal, has dueled with Justice Scalia dozens of times, from Bush v. Gore [the 2000 presidential election dispute] to recent dilemmas testing the Guantanamo detainees. Justice Ginsburg, his closest friend on the court, sees his influence beyond the marble walls, and that's the way I've been mostly viewing him until the recent terms. He is influential with conservative acolytes. Within the court, he certainly alienated [now-retired Justice Sandra Day] O'Connor, Justice [Harry] Blackmun, and in some ways Justice [Anthony] Kennedy. It made his influence rather slight for years -- he really didn't want to deal, to negotiate with his colleagues in rulings. Despite a charming personality in many ways, he told me he had nothing to trade. He was just plain firm about where he wanted to go, and he wouldn't settle for half a loaf. The addition of Chief Justice [John] Roberts and Justice [Samuel] Alito on the bench allowed him to win more. And in recent terms, there has a been a culmination, a resurgence, on what he is able to do, now with the [conservative] bodies coming on the court to support him. But he told me he was still not satisfied. ""The wins,"" he told me, ""Damn few."" CNN: In his bright, bold opinions, what is he trying to accomplish? Does he reach for broader audience? Biskupic: Look at 1996's Romer v. Evans -- the gay rights case. He lost on that one, and his dissent was written for consumption way beyond the court. It was a complete battle cry. He lashes out at the court for placing what he said was ""the prestige of this institution behind the proposition that opposition to homosexuality is as reprehensible as racial or religious bias."" This dissent became more of a story than the opinion itself. People were reading it and giving it airspace, and that's what he wanted. That was his style of most of the '90s: Get as much attention as possible, because he was in dissent so much in big cases. Now, in the recent Heller case case [where Scalia wrote the main opinion striking down Washington, D.C.'s, strict handgun ban], he was not going able to write an opinion as boldly as he may have wanted, in terms of some of the zingers that he packs into his other opinions, because he has to keep his majority. But he still will not mince words if he is in dissent, because he knows journalists, law students, policy makers will all pay attention, and it will influence people down the road. CNN: And yet controversy seems to dog him, including the duck hunting trip he took with Vice President [Dick] Cheney at a time the high court was considering an appeal from Cheney's office; and a hand gesture Scalia made outside a Catholic church some interpreted as obscene. Biskupic: I don't think he cares. He's got these intense feelings he's not going to keep in check. CNN: What prompted this project, and what do you want readers to know about Justice Scalia? Biskupic: I found most of what was written about him was either one side or the other -- screeds easily from the left and embraces easily from the right. And I thought there was so much to his background that was worth revealing in an objective way, to see what he was all about: How Scalia became Scalia. He was really part of the conservative moment we saw in the 1980s. Young lawyers at the time like John Roberts and Samuel Alito embraced his theories, and look where they ended up. CNN: In your interviews with him and his family, did you expect that level of cooperation? Biskupic: No, I didn't. In the beginning, he said he would encourage colleagues to talk to me, but he didn't want to sit and talk on the record. But he soon became quite intrigued at my research into his family, immigration records and such. And I'd be at my desk, and he'd be calling me, asking me what I found out about his ancestors. So those later, extensive interviews made this book. CNN: There is a challenge about writing on the often cloistered world of the Supreme Court, these personalities that remain below the radar for most people. Biskupic: I wanted a book that would demystify him, and make people understand him. I wanted readers to know: This is your court, you should know about these people and what they're up to. But it is tough, it's so hard to get information about the institution that doesn't have to do with the precise words on the rulings. And it's fun to dig up this background, and get in with these justices and talk with them one-on-one. I was so grateful to speak with Justices Stevens, Ginsburg and even Justice [Clarence] Thomas, who all shared great stories and offered their insights into Justice Scalia.","Biography looks at conservative, confrontational jurist's influence on law, society .

"(CNN) -- Thirty years ago Wednesday, Iranian student revolutionaries climbed over the walls of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and seized dozens of Americans, whom they ultimately held hostage for 444 days. The hostage crisis, coming in the aftermath of Iran's Islamic revolution, ended diplomatic relations between Washington and Tehran -- a rift that persists to this day. Iran celebrates the embassy takeover as an official holiday, and tens of thousands showed up in Tehran on Wednesday to hear anti-American speeches. The anniversary was also an opportunity to reignite the anti-government protests that were sparked in June, following a disputed presidential election, and thousands of anti-government protesters ignored warnings from Iranian authorities to stay home. One of the leaders of the 1979 hostage-takers says the United States and Iran must not be hostages to history. ""I am not willing to be a hostage of that historical event,"" Ebrahim Asgharzadeh said on CNN's ""Amanpour,"" in an interview marking the anniversary. ""Neither Iran nor the United States should be hijacked by that historical event,"" he said from Tehran, where he went on to become a reformist lawmaker and was himself jailed by the Islamic regime. He said the two sides need to be aware of the past without being imprisoned by it. ""If they do not pay attention to ... history they will have an unstable future, an impermanent future,"" he said. Asgharzadeh said he and his fellow students had been offended that Jimmy Carter, then the U.S. president, had let the deposed Shah of Iran into the United States for medical treatment -- and said the actions of his compatriots had parallels in the United States. ""We felt insulted -- our revolution, our people -- and so there was a rebellion,"" he said through a translator. ""A measure was needed to be taken that was effective, that could impact the world public opinion. ""We were not radical students. We were revolutionary students, in the sense that we were defending our country, our people, our nation,"" he said. ""What the students did for the first two or three days, it was a student activity. It was meant to protest, something that American students did many times on the streets to protest the Vietnam War."" But John Limbert, a former American hostage, is not convinced by the comparison. ""Whatever they thought they were doing, whether it was a 1970s-style student sit-in, the results of it were very ... different,"" he told Christiane Amanpour. And it was not the American hostages who suffered most, he added. ""They brought misery to the Iranian people. What happened to us was difficult. It was frightening. It was -- it was uncomfortable. But it lasted 14 months and was over,"" he said. ""We certainly didn't expect it to last that long. They have said they didn't expect [it] to last that long. But what they did, in effect, was to create a climate of lawlessness and mob rule [of which] they and their compatriots are today the greatest victims,"" said Limbert, the author of ""Negotiating with Iran, Wrestling the Ghost of History."" The hostage crisis escalated beyond what any of the participants expected as Iran's new revolutionary government publicly backed the hostage-takers, Asgharzadeh and former Carter aide Gary Sick agree. ""That way it became actually an act of the Iranian government, rather than a group of students who were acting potentially outside the law,"" said Sick, who was Carter's point man on Iran. ""So basically, the situation got out of hand, in terms of being a student activity,"" Asgharzadeh said. ""It became a societal issue backed by the leadership. ""And every day that passed on, things got more complicated. The analysis got more complicated in the White House. They lost their cool. They didn't know what to do. And they faced a challenge by the Iranian revolution and this revolutionary thought. And it reached a point where nobody felt prepared to deal with it,"" the former student revolutionary said. ""And so after a while, both America and Iran were looking for a solution, because both their hands were tied at that stage, but the solution needed to be such that no country would be seen as the loser,"" he said. That impasse still dominates the wary relationship between Tehran and Washington, Amanpour's guests said. But it is time to call in the Ghostbusters, Limbert said, referring to the popular movie that came out not long after the Americans were finally released. ""You know, they put the ghosts in the can and put the can away. And somehow ... you've got to do that,"" he said. ""You don't forget them. You don't necessarily even ask for an apology. But you look them in the face, you know them for what they are, which is a very ugly and negative act, and then you put them in their proper compartment,"" he advised. But Sick, now a Columbia University professor, said the hostage crisis continues to have ramifications in Washington today. ""The hostage crisis was extended probably eight months beyond what it should have been. No matter how you look at it in terms of Iran's interests or what have you, they simply couldn't make up their mind,"" he said of the regime in Tehran. ""And it has left the impression that, one, Iran can't be trusted; two, that when they negotiate, they negotiate in bad faith; and, three, that they are paying only attention to their own internal circumstances and ignoring everybody else. ""That is a legacy that we live with and even people who don't remember the hostage crisis at all still have that image of Iran that was created in those days that has not gone away,"" he said.","One hostage-taker says 1979 embassy takeover was protest by angry students .

"(CNN) -- Luis Caplan served the poor of the South Bronx for decades out of a small medical office. His leg was amputated after a bout with cancer in 1990, yet he continued to work for another five years. Luis Caplan, 71, asks of the stimulus package: ""What happens to the real middle class?"" Now, his savings have nearly been wiped out because of the economic crisis. At the age of 71, he faces losing his apartment if things don't change soon. The government bailed out the big institutions, but ""what happens to the little people?"" he asks. ""What happens to the real middle class? What happens to me?"" he says, choking back tears. ""It's awful. It's really awful."" With Congress working to pass the $800 billion stimulus bill, millions of  Americans -- especially those with homes they're trying to sell or about to be foreclosed on -- are asking the same thing: What's in it for me? Caplan says most of his equity is tied up in his 800-square-foot apartment that he purchased in 1985. He wants to sell it to move to Seattle, Washington, to be near his daughter, who was recently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. But his place has sat on the market for three months without an offer. Located in a tony neighborhood in Manhattan's Upper East Side, apartments used to sell in a matter of weeks. Caplan has dropped $50,000 from the original asking price of $625,000 and may have to drop the price again. He says he can barely afford maintenance fees and other monthly costs associated with his place. He hopes to make enough money to pay off the reverse mortgage he took out to supplement his Social Security payments. ""I don't know how much more I can go through like this,"" he says, sobbing even more. ""I'm going crazy with this."" His son, Danny Caplan, says, ""He's collateral damage. He has equity and could sell it and walk away and have enough to live comfortably. But [he can't] because of the economic situation."" America's housing crisis has become a key issue for Washington policymakers. Millions of Americans are in foreclosure or facing foreclosure; others are out of work trying to sell their homes in a down economy. And there are elderly people, such as Caplan, who want to sell immediately to help stabilize their finances. Send us your thoughts on the stimulus plan . President Obama on Tuesday told people at a town hall meeting in Fort Myers, Florida, that he plans to announce in coming weeks ""what our overall housing strategy is going to be."" Secretary of Treasury Tim Geithner made the rounds in Washington on Tuesday to push the stimulus bill, including the need to jump-start America's housing market.  See stimulus bill provisions » . ""Homeowners around the country are seeing the value of their homes fall because of forces they did not create and cannot control,"" he said. ""This crisis in housing has had devastating consequences, and our government should have moved more forcefully to help contain the damage."" At one Senate hearing, Sen. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, said ""decisive action"" is needed to address the housing crisis. ""I think the message should come through clear from all of us, you have to move aggressively, clearly, and to start working,"" Reed said. ""I agree with you,"" Geithner responded. ""Our objective is, and our hope is, that our program meets that test."" The stimulus bill does sweeten the pot for potential homebuyers, which supporters say could help spur the economy. Critics charge that letting housing prices stabilize on their own is healthy for the economy. The Senate's version of the bill offers a $15,000 tax credit to anyone who purchases a home in the next year, more than double the tax credit offered by the House. Dwight Jaffee, a professor of real estate and finance at the University of California-Berkeley, says the housing market is the ""perfect instrument in leading the economy out of recession because housing is such a big-ticket item."" ""We will not turnaround this economy until we start to turn around housing. I hope people in Washington are hearing it,"" he says. In the case of Luis Caplan, Jaffee says, ""What it means to him, if they did carry out this program, then the government would be stimulating the demand -- the buyers -- for his apartment to sell it at a fuller price and much sooner."" Caplan says that would be a good thing. He needs all the help he can get. Born in Argentina, Caplan came to the United States as a legal immigrant in 1964 to pursue his dream of becoming a doctor. He eventually became a naturalized U.S. citizen and opened his medical office to help treat the Spanish-speaking poor of the South Bronx. He believed his calling was to help ""the poorest of the poor"" get decent medical treatment, rather than pursue the more high-paying lifestyle of other doctors. Most of his patients were on Medicaid, so he got paid at a rate much less than other doctors. He beams with pride at the lives he saved. ""I caught cancers very early,"" he said. ""I'm not the savior of humanity. ... I just did what I could to help poor people."" In June 1990 at the age of 53, Caplan started having pain in his left leg. It turned out to be a malignant tumor and his leg was amputated. Yet his passion and commitment to helping others kept him going. Even after losing his leg, he went back to work for another five years. When he retired, he got another shocker: Social Security initially rejected him -- a man without a leg -- for disability. He says he scraped and saved money along the way, ""a very small amount that has practically disappeared."" He now scoots around his apartment in his wheelchair hoping for better days. As far as he's concerned, the big Wall Street institutions can ""burn in hell."" ""I don't have a Rolls-Royce. I don't have a Cadillac,"" he says. ""The government ... isn't trying to help everybody: People like me that went through this, people who did something good for the community, people who didn't buy an expensive painting for their office."" Caplan pauses. ""This is what I'm left with: an apartment that can hardly sell."" His son is proud of his father's accomplishments, yet he's frustrated that his dad is in such a financial pinch during a time that's supposed to be the Golden Years of his life. ""He bought the American dream and paid for the American dream,"" says Danny Caplan. CNN's Jackie Adams contributed to this report.","Luis Caplan, 71, committed his life to the poor; now, he faces losing his home .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Back-to-back suicide bombings killed at least five people at a university here Tuesday and wounded nearly two dozen, authorities said. Police investigators collect evidence at the suicide blast site at Islamic International University in Islamabad. The explosions occurred at the International Islamic University in the Pakistani capital, said police official Bin Yamin. Naeem Iqbal, Islamabad police spokesman, said three men and two female students were killed, and 22 people were injured. At least four of the injured were in critical condition, said Altaf Hussein, a doctor at a hospital. All the victims are between the ages of 18 and 25. Usman Virk, a student, said he heard one explosion in the men's section of the university, followed by a blast in the cafeteria in the women's section of the university.  Watch more about the attacks » . Virk said he saw several injured students with blood-soaked clothes being taken away by rescue crews. More than 12,000 foreign and local students, including 5,500 women, are enrolled in the 29-year-old university. The university Web site describes the school as a ""unique center of learning in the Muslim world which strives to combine the essentials of the Islamic faith with the best of modern knowledge."" In recent weeks, Pakistan has been relentlessly rocked by a wave of suicide attacks as Islamic militants retaliate against a military offensive to rout insurgents operating along the Pakistan-Afghan border. On Friday, a suicide car bomber detonated near a police station in Peshawar, the capital of the North West Frontier Province. The blast killed at least 13 people, most of them civilians. A day earlier, militants attacked two police training centers and the country's Federal Investigation Agency in Lahore in eastern Pakistan. At least 30 Pakistani police officers and civilians were killed in those attacks. At least 10 attackers also died. And on October 10, militants held dozens of hostages for 22 hours inside an army headquarters in Rawalpindi, which neighbors Islamabad. Eleven military personnel, three civilians, and nine militants were killed in the siege.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama got some political cover Sunday for his upcoming announcement on sending more troops to Afghanistan. A report released by the Democratic staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee blamed the Bush administration for failing to capture or kill Osama bin Laden when the al Qaeda leader was cornered in Afghanistan's Tora Bora mountain region in December 2001. The report, released Sunday, said the situation in Afghanistan presented greater problems today because of the failure to nab bin Laden eight years ago. Bin Laden had written his will, apparently sensing he was trapped, but the lack of sufficient forces to close in for the kill allowed him to escape to tribal areas in Pakistan, according to the report. It said former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and top U.S. commander Gen. Tommy Franks held back the necessary forces for a ""classic sweep-and-block maneuver"" that could have prevented bin Laden's escape. ""It would have been a dangerous fight across treacherous terrain, and the injection of more U.S. troops and the resulting casualties would have contradicted the risk-averse, 'light footprint' model formulated by Rumsfeld and Franks,"" the report said. When criticized later for not zeroing in on bin Laden, administration officials, including former Vice President Dick Cheney, responded that the al Qaeda leader's location was uncertain. ""But the review of existing literature, unclassified government records and interviews with central participants underlying this report removes any lingering doubts and makes it clear that Osama bin Laden was within our grasp at Tora Bora,"" the report said. On Tuesday, Obama will travel to West Point, New York, to announce his decision on a request by his commanding general in Afghanistan for up to 40,000 additional troops. Obama is expected to send more than 30,000 U.S. troops and seek further troop commitments from NATO allies as part of a counterinsurgency strategy to wipe out al Qaeda elements and stabilize the country while training Afghan forces. By releasing the report Sunday, Sen. John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, focused attention on the past failure of the Bush administration to take out bin Laden, saying that had created a greater problem today. ""Our inability to finish the job in late 2001 has contributed to a conflict today that endangers not just our troops and those of our allies, but the stability of a volatile and vital region,"" Kerry, D-Massachusetts, wrote in a letter of transmittal for the report. When Kerry was the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004, he argued that the Bush administration botched the pursuit of bin Laden and that then-President George W. Bush ""took his eye off the ball"" in Afghanistan to invade Iraq. The accusations were hotly disputed by Bush supporters and Franks. However, Gary Berntsen, the CIA operative who led the pursuit of bin Laden at Tora Bora, said in 2005 that his request for up to 800 U.S. troops to cut off the al Qaeda leader's escape route was denied. Sen. Richard Lugar, the ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations committee, told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that the new report ""does serve as a convenient way for, perhaps, Democrats to say once again, there's another failing of the past administration"" and that ""all the problems have accumulated."" ""I think we have to accept that there were many failings,"" said Lugar, of Indiana. ""But the problem right now is, what do we do presently? What will the president's plan be? How much confidence do we have in this president and this plan?"" Democratic Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, responding to Lugar's comment, told CNN that Obama faced ""the culmination of decisions that were made eight years"" earlier, which he said ""made the situation much more difficult"" today. According to the report, ""removing the al Qaeda leader from the battlefield eight years ago would not have eliminated the worldwide extremist threat."" ""But the decisions that opened the door for his escape to Pakistan allowed bin Laden to emerge as a potent symbolic figure who continues to attract a steady flow of money and inspire fanatics worldwide,"" it said. The report called bin Laden's escape ""a lost opportunity that forever altered the course of the conflict in Afghanistan and the future of international terrorism, leaving the American people more vulnerable to terrorism, laying the foundation for today's protracted Afghan insurgency and inflaming the internal strife now endangering Pakistan."" The report also highlighted bin Laden's will, dated December 14, 2001, as an indication of the dire situation he faced. ""Bin Laden expected to die,"" it said, noting that a copy of the will that surfaced later is regarded as authentic. ""Allah commended to us that when death approaches any of us that we make a bequest to parents and next of kin and to Muslims as a whole,"" the report quoted bin Laden's will as saying, adding that he ""instructed his wives not to remarry and apologized to his children for devoting himself to"" holy war. However, the report said, ""fewer than 100 American commandos were on the scene with their Afghan allies and calls for reinforcements to launch an assault were rejected."" ""Requests were also turned down for U.S. troops to block the mountain paths leading to sanctuary a few miles away in Pakistan,"" it continued. ""The vast array of American military power, from sniper teams to the most mobile divisions of the Marine Corps and the Army, was kept on the sidelines. Instead, the U.S. command chose to rely on airstrikes and untrained Afghan militias to attack bin Laden and on Pakistan's loosely organized Frontier Corps to seal his escape routes. ""On or around December 16, two days after writing his will, bin Laden and an entourage of bodyguards walked unmolested out of Tora Bora and disappeared into Pakistan's unregulated tribal area. Most analysts say he is still there today.""","Report released by Senate panel blames Bush officials for bin Laden escape .

"Colombo, Sri Lanka (CNN) -- Sri Lanka's opposition presidential candidate accused the incumbent of intimidation, as early returns reported by state-run TV SLRC showed President Mahinda Rajapaksa leading the race. Candidate Gen. Sarath Fonseka accused Rajapaksa of intimidation during the country's first peacetime presidential election in more than two decades and said his staff had received threatening phone calls . Army soldiers and commandos tried to enter the Cinnamon Lakeside Hotel shortly after Fonseka and opposition party members arrived Tuesday, the former general told CNN. His security forces told the soldiers they could not enter the building, so they stayed outside, Fonseka said. Fonseka said he was not leaving the hotel, citing the armed soldiers outside. Several dozen armed soldiers lined the street of the Cinnamon Lakeside Hotel and surrounding area, checking cars driving up to the building in the nation's capital, Colombo. ""He's ignoring the constitution to remain in power,"" Fonseka said of ally-turned-rival Rajapaksa. There was no immediate reaction from Rajapaksa's government in response to Fonseka's claims. The presidential election is the first since government forces put down a 26-year insurgency by Tamil Tiger rebels. And controversy mounted as vote tallying began. Earlier Tuesday, top politicians vowed to block Fonseka from taking office if he won because he is not eligible to vote. The government will fight the commissioner of elections in the Supreme Court on the issue of Fonseka's eligibility, Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama vowed. Fonseka admits he is not registered to vote; 14 million Sri Lankans are eligible. What will Sri Lankan election mean? Rajapaksa and Fonseka have waged a bitter battle against each other. Both men say they are winning the election. But early returns showed Rajapaksa was leading in the race, state-run television SLRC reported. Fonseka broke ranks with the Rajapaksa administration after he was elevated to the largely ceremonial post of chief of defense staff in July, following his retirement as army commander. After Fonseka announced his presidential bid, the main opposition parties -- with widely diverse political ideologies -- closed ranks behind him to make him their common candidate. The general is riding a wave of popularity after he led a military campaign to crush Sri Lanka's Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The Tamil Tigers, as they are known, fought a brutal war for decades against the government and controlled large swathes of territory at the height of their power. Rajapaksa also claims war-hero status with the win against the Tamil Tigers last May. He is seeking a fresh mandate for his government, advocating for more development programs and jobs. And in his revised booklet, ""Mahinda Chinthanaya"" (""Thoughts of Mahinda""), he campaigns to ensure a ""better tomorrow."" But in the lead-up to the election, the island nation just south of India has become host to escalating violence. Three and a half hours before Sri Lankans headed to the polls, explosions that residents said sounded like mortar fire were heard. While it was unclear what Tuesday's explosions were, there have been more than 700 reports of violence ahead of the election, and at least our deaths reported, said Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu of the Center for Policy Alternatives, a branch of the Centre for Monitoring Election Violence. There have been allegations of interference with mail-in ballots, according to the group. Most of the complaints have been against members of Rajapaksa's government, the center said. The spokesman for United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said last week that the U.N. chief was ""concerned about the growing violence in the lead-up to the presidential election."" ""The peaceful conduct of the first post-conflict national election is of the highest importance for long-term peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka,"" he added. CNN's Sara Sidner and Iqbal Athas contributed to this report.","NEW: Early returns show Rajapaksa leading, state-run TV SLRC reports .

"(CNN) -- After nearly going to war last year over a Colombian military raid inside Ecuador, the two nations seemed to be patching relations when their foreign ministers met a few weeks ago. Then an Ecuadorian judge issued an arrest warrant this week for the head of the Colombian armed forces, pushing relations back one giant step. Colombian Gen. Freddy Padilla, the armed forces chief whose arrest is sought, canceled a meeting scheduled for Friday with Ecuadorian Gen. Fabian Varela. Padilla thought he might be arrested if he traveled to Ecuador. It's not the first pothole on the path to normalization. Ecuador previously issued an arrest warrant for former Colombian Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos, who held the post during last year's raid. Colombia has dismissed both warrants, saying Ecuador has no jurisdiction to investigate and judge Colombian officials. Analyst Patrick Esteruelas of the Eurasia Group consulting firm calls Ecuador's actions ""schizophrenic."" Two former U.S. ambassadors to the area agree this is par for Ecuadorian foreign policy. ""That's the history of Ecuador, unfortunately,"" said Peter Romero, ambassador to that nation from 1993 to 1996. ""One step forward, two steps back."" Myles Frechette, U.S. ambassador to Colombia from 1994 to 1997, said Friday that ""Ecuador is a specialist in bonehead plays. It has been for years. Nothing's changed much."" Former Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Heinz Moeller, who served from 2000 to 2003, called the arrest warrant ""lamentable."" ""It's absurd that these things happen,"" he said Friday. Tension between the two nations has existed for years. The latest enmity started in March 2008, when Colombia bombed a guerrilla base inside Ecuador. The raid killed a top leader for the Revolutionary Armed Force of Colombia, commonly known as the FARC. The Marxist guerrilla group has been waging war on Colombia since the 1960s and often takes refuge on the Ecuadorian side of the border. At least 25 people were killed, most of them said to be FARC guerrillas. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe hailed the attack, saying ""terrorism ... does not respect borders."" Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa called the attack ""aggression"" and a ""massacre"" and severed diplomatic relations with Colombia. Both nations went on war footing but stopped short of military action. Over time, tensions seemed to dissipate and Colombian Foreign Minister Jaime Bermudez and his Ecuadorian counterpart, Fander Falconi, met last month. After the meeting, Colombia signed a statement saying it would never attack inside Ecuador again. Friday's meeting between the two nations' top generals was supposed to further repair the damage. Then came the arrest warrant. What happened? Perhaps politics. Definitely one branch of the government acting without the consent of the other. Falconi quickly pointed out that the nation's judicial branch, not Correa's administration, decided to issue the warrant. Analysts agree that it wasn't Correa's doing. ""That's not a very coordinated government,"" said Frechette, the former envoy to Colombia. ""The executive branch didn't issue that order."" Moeller, the former Ecuadorian foreign minister, said the judge who issued the arrest warrant is ""motivated by political criteria."" ""I don't have another explanation,"" said Moeller, who also served as president of the Ecuadorian Congress three times. Normalization of relations will be a slow process, Eurasia analyst Esteruelas said. ""We're going to see a lot of stops and starts,"" he said. Alejandro Santos, editorial director of La Semana weekly news magazine in Colombia, said relations will not improve until the two countries ""can close the chapter"" on last year's bombing raid. ""That chapter can be closed when the Colombian government promises not to do that. They have done that (promise),"" Santos said. ""Now Ecuador needs to start avoiding those types of judicial measures against Colombian officials."" Esteruelas said Ecuador felt justifiably aggrieved over the attack and wants to make sure it never happens again. But he also sees another issue at play: Ecuadorian President Correa's plummeting poll numbers and domestic problems with indigenous movements and other political issues. ""It's usually convenient to remind everyone that Correa is fighting for Ecuadorian sovereignty,"" Esteruelas said, adding that such nationalism ""resonates very broadly"" across the political spectrum. But Frechette said, ""Correa really does want to reach some kind of agreement."" The problems between the two nations are long-standing and have a lot to do with the 45-year-old war between Colombia and the FARC. From Ecuador's perspective, the war has displaced about 250,000 Colombians who have sought refuge in Ecuador. Those refugees need services and jobs, further straining a poor area that's already on the brink. Ecuador also resents that the FARC have set up camps inside the country, causing security problems for a nation that is not technically at war with the guerrillas. From Colombia's point of view, Ecuador is not doing enough to combat the FARC and is allowing the guerrillas to have a sanctuary that Colombian troops cannot reach. Further complicating the relationship, Ecuador's Correa is politically aligned with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who is no friend of Colombia and its leader, Uribe. Chavez threatened to attack neighboring Colombia after the military raid in Ecuador. ""This has been developing for many years,"" Moeller said. But there are great advantages to normalizing relations, most of them economic. Ecuador, for example, is Colombia's third-largest export market. Walter Spurrier, president of Grupo Spurrier and director of Weekly Analysis in Guayaquil, Ecuador, and Maria Velez de Berliner, president of the Latin Intelligence Corp. in Alexandria, Virginia, talked with the Inter-American Dialog policy institute last month about Colombia-Ecuador economic activity. ""Re-establishing relations could lead Ecuador to lift sanctions against Colombian products, which forced many small- and medium-sized businesses to collapse on both sides of the border,"" Velez told the Washington-based think tank. Said Spurrier, ""For Colombia, Ecuador is an important market. Not so the other way around. But the goods Ecuador sells Colombia are difficult to relocate to other markets. Ecuador now attempts to sell Libya and Iran the rice it would have otherwise sold Colombia. Also, Ecuadorian importers have to look for other sources."" Moeller, the former foreign minister, wants normalization to get back on track. ""We have to close the parenthesis,"" he said. ""I hope this passes ... and that they start talking again.""","Ecuadorian judge issues an arrest warrant for head of Colombian armed forces .

"(OPRAH.com) -- When I was a teen, I tried to read the entire Encyclopedia Britannica. My goal: Memorize its contents, be on TV game shows, win cash and prizes, run away from home, move to Manhattan and become a professional writer. Instead of focusing on getting Mr. Right, focus on finding Life Plan Right, says author. I got as far as Asparagus. To this day, I know a little about a lot of words beginning with ""A."" Some favorites: ants, atoms, alchemy. Plus, Aristotle was a childhood crush, because I've always loved philosophy. When I finished reading his one-page encyclopedic write-up, I bought books about him. I'd been saving these dog-eared, underlined Aristotle books, as well as the ""A"" book of Britannica, all to be used in a novel, where I'd been planning to bless my protagonist with the quirky detail of knowing all things ""A."" I recently rediscovered these Aristotle books when moving apartments. I flipped through and was surprised to discover Aristotle said a lot of the same things about love and happiness as modern psychologists. Only Aristotle obviously said it first, having been born at least 300 years B.C. Plus, Aristotle said it truly wisely. Indeed, much of what Aristotle said hit home big-time -- in particular about a sexy, smart, funny, rich, lying, cheating, don't-get-me-started Prince Harming I'd just broken up with. I could almost hear what Aristotle might say to me if we were to chat over souvlaki. 'Sold your soul to be with him' ""Mea bene, Karen,"" Aristotle would say. ""You know what your problem was with your ex? He was not your soul mate -- but your 'sold' mate -- because you sold your soul to be with him. Sure he was sexy, smart, rich, funny -- but alas, he was a liar and a cheat."" ""You're an intellectual guy."" I'd correct the regaled philosopher called the ""Mind of the Academy"" by Plato. ""I'm surprised you believe in something as namby-pamby metaphysical as a soul mate!"" Oprah.com: 10 rules to soul mate love . ""Absolutely!"" My fave Greek philosopher buddy Ari would respond emphatically. ""Actually, I sort of coined the concept of 'soul mate.' If there'd been a little TM trademark thingy back in the 300s B.C., I'd be a very rich man today. I firmly believe caretaking the soul is incredibly important for happiness. I describe a soul mate as a 'soul-nurturing mate.' Someone who nurtures your soul, thereby promoting insight and growth. I pushed folks to find soul mates because, in my opinion, real happiness only comes when you stimulate your core self -- and grow into your highest potential. Basically, the soul is the ultimate G-spot for happiness."" Of course, I'm paraphrasing for my philosopher buddy. But if Aristotle were here, I know he'd agree with my verbal modernization. Plus, Ari would go on to describe how he views the world as offering three kinds of relationships, only one of which brings true happiness. 3 kinds of relationships . According to ancient philosopher Aristotle, there are three kinds of relationships, only one of which will bring you true happiness. Find out how your relationship measures up! 1. Relationships of pleasure . Partners who are about sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. You share soulless, passionate sex and playful banter -- but they're about the body or ego. They never soul-nurture you with insight and growth, so they never bring real-deal happiness. Oprah.com: How to break your bad man habit . 2. Relationships of utility . Partners you spend time with in hopes of garnering status, power, money and beauty like the rich guy with a trophy girl. Again, this is about body or ego and doesn't bring true joy. 3. Relationships of shared virtue . Partners who challenge and inspire you to grow into your highest potential and nurture your soul. A good example is when Jack Nicholson's character in ""As Good As It Gets"" says, ""You make me want to be a better man."" When you prioritize seeking a partner who supports you becoming your best self -- instead of crushing on ""superficial lures""(hotness, funniness, smartness, success, etc.) -- you wind up with a soul mate/a Prince Charming/a definite keeper! With this in mind, if you want to be happy in love, you must take time to see past a guy's ""superficial lures"" and look inside his ""superinsidehimself."" Unfortunately, those fumes of chemistry can often dizzy a gal into making stupid love choices. That's why it's important to remember: Hot, steamy chemistry eventually fades -- and what's always left beneath is a person's true soul. Yes, if you want to be happy, you must seek a good-hearted, ethical soul who brings you great growth -- not simply a hottie who brings great grope Oprah.com: The best things to do for your relationship . Confession time: Another superficially alluring quality I've been suckered in by is humor. I am Silly Putty in a friggin' funny man's hands. I once had a boyfriend who teased me that the secret to getting me into bed was to crack five good jokes in a night. He'd count down his jokes as the night progressed. Unfortunately, funniness is a mere decorative quality -- sometimes developed to avoid talking about real-life issues. Which is why in the past, after a few months of dating a friggin' funny guy, I've witnessed all that fabulous ha-ha-ha laughter often gives way to tears when the guy's true character -- true soul -- shows up as one that avoids honest communication, warm empathy and the desire for growth. Then, when I try to connect soul to soul -- heart to heart -- I am greeted by a gigantic, unmovable whoopee cushion wall. Basically, friggin' funny is only the tiniest tip of a person. Meanwhile, a person's soul is a person's foundation! For the record: Aristotle wasn't against finding someone friggin' funny or friggin' sexy or friggin' rich. He believed these pleasure-bringing qualities were good for stirring up passion, which humans need to be our fullest selves! But Aristotle recognized ""superficial lures"" and material goods were simply what he called ""means to the ends"" of happiness, not ""the final ends,"" which is always to grow into your most esteemed self. As Aristotle said: ""Men imagine the causes of happiness lie in external goods. That is as if they were to ascribe fine and beautiful lyre playing to the quality of the instrument rather than the skill of the player."" Or as I like to say, ""It's just as easy to complain about a rich man as it is to complain about a poor man."" Basically, it doesn't matter how rich a guy is if his behavior makes you twitchy and miserable. While on the subject of money, Aristotle was no fan of slackers either. He recognized that being or dating poor brought its share of problems. He even admitted the lack of a certain amount of wealth was as much an obstacle to happiness as deprivation of freedom. He gladly accepted that some wealth was needed to be happy -- just as exciting bodily pleasures were needed. But again, wealth and bodily pleasures were mere means to the ends of happiness -- these ultimate ends being to nourish your soul, so you can reach your most esteemed level of self. A big secret to happiness? Stop focusing on finding a Mr. Right! Start focusing on finding Life Plan Right. When a Mr. Potential Right comes along, you must ask yourself if this guy will lead you to Life Plan Right or Life Plan Wrong. As you get to know the guy, look to see if he: . 1. Offers you exciting growth as well as exciting grope . 2. Has developed good character -- so he'll be a positive influence on your character development. If the guy scores two for two, you're likely in Prince Charming territory. Oprah.com: What you could learn from dating 100 men .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Transportation Security Administration Tuesday said it is launching a ""full review"" of an incident in which the agency posted on the Internet a sensitive manual outlining screening procedures for law enforcement officers, diplomats, prisoners, federal air marshals and others. In a statement Tuesday night, the TSA sought to minimize the impact of the unintentional release -- calling the document ""outdated,"" ""unclassified"" and unimplemented -- while saying that it took the incident ""very seriously,"" and ""took swift action"" when it was discovered. Congressional critics, meanwhile, lambasted the agency and called for an independent investigation. ""Undoubtedly, this raises potential security concerns across our transportation system,"" House Homeland Security Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi, and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, wrote in a letter to TSA Acting Administrator Gale Rossides. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, called the release of the information ""shocking"" and reckless. ""This manual provides a road map to those who would do us harm,"" she said. At issue is a 93-page manual giving instruction to airport screeners on how to screen individuals. It also gives details on how screening is conducted and the limitations of X-ray machines. The TSA posted the manual on a Federal Business Opportunities Web site that provides information for government contractors and redacted sensitive parts. But the redacted information was not properly protected, and the information was restored by people familiar with the computer program. The TSA said the posted manual -- dated May 28, 2008, with an implementation date of June 30, 2008 -- was never implemented and has been revised six times, although it did not elaborate on the extent of the revisions. ""While the document does demonstrate the complexities of checkpoint security, it does not contain information related to the specifics of everyday checkpoint screening procedures,"" the TSA said Tuesday. ""The traveling public should be assured that appropriate measures have been put in place to ensure the continued implementation of a strong security screening program,"" it said. The TSA said it removed the report as soon as it learned of the problem. But it was too late. The full, un-redacted version of the report appeared on at least one Web site on Sunday, and was even more widely distributed on Tuesday.","TSA said posted document is ""outdated,"" ""unclassified"" and unimplemented .
