"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- CNN talk show host Larry King and his wife, Shawn King, each filed for divorce Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court. Both cited ""irreconcilable differences"" in their filings, but they disagreed over custody of the two children from the 12 years of marriage. He wants to share legal and physical custody of the boys with her, but she is asking the court to grant physical custody to her alone. The Kings have two sons, ages 9 and 11. ""His major concern is for the children and beyond that he will have no further comment,"" Larry King's publicist said in a written statement. Shawn King's lawyer did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. The documents said the couple separated on Tuesday, the same day Shawn King signed her papers. Larry King's signature was dated Wednesday. Both petitions were filed Wednesday. Each is asking that they not be ordered to pay spousal support to the other, and they both want the other to pay their attorney fees. While his filing offers little detail about what marital property he will claim, her petition lists the Beverly Hills, California, home where the couple has resided for the past two years and two Utah houses. Larry King asked the court to declare any ""purported transmutation agreement"" to be ""null, void and unenforceable."" California law provides for marital contracts, known as transmutation agreements, to designate ownership of certain property between spouses. When Larry King, 76, married Shawn Engemann Southwick, 50, on September 5, 1997, it was his eighth marriage to seven women. King has hosted a nightly prime time talk show on CNN since June 1985. He hosted a late night national radio talk show before joining CNN.","Larry and Shawn King have been married for 12 years, have 2 sons .

"(CNN) -- The day Harry Potter fans have been waiting for is here. On Friday, Universal Studios is opening its ""Wizarding World of Harry Potter"" attraction at Universal's Islands of Adventure theme park in Orlando, Florida. The park-within-a-park, as it's being called, recreates various locations, scenes and other elements from the wildly popular book and movie series. Harry Potter has beaten out fellow Brit celluloid character James Bond as the top-grossing film series in history. One of the reasons Harry Potter is so successful is its legions of fans, both young and old. Alex Black is one of them. She and her family made a special trip to Orlando from Georgia to be guests at a ""soft opening"" of the park a couple of weeks ago. She was one of the first to catch a glimpse of Hogwarts, the fictional boarding school for young wizards, and to drink some ""butterbeer"" at the attraction. According to 16-year-old Alex, ""it's worth waiting hours in line, it's worth the money, it's worth the long drive from Georgia, it's beyond worth it."" When asked what her favorite part of the park was, she responded, ""Everything was my favorite."" Alex, like millions of other ""muggles"" around the world, has been a long-time fan of the boy wizard, Potter, and his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, since the first author J.K. Rowling's seven-book series debuted. ""I've grown up with Harry Potter. I've brought all the books they came out, I dressed up for Harry Potter spirit day at my school. And when I'll be a senior, the last (movie) -- when Harry is like that age, as a senior -- will come out. So, he's kind of like the family pet in a way,"" she said. iReport: Share your photos, reviews of ""Potter"" theme park . And it's not just the teenagers who are just wild about Harry. Laura Boyles, a 55-year-old mother and book store employee from Orlando, said, ""I can't wait to go to the park -- I'm so excited for it to open. I love the Harry Potter series."" Alex agrees, ""He's a generational thing; we've grown up with him. My grandpa and my aunt like him too. It's just something that I've grown up with. "" Alex is happy that the Wizarding World opened when it did. ""When I read the last book it was almost like the end, I still had the movies, but I was afraid it would be over, but the park is a way for it to live on."" Widespread industry speculation has it that Universal shelled out some $265 million for this Potter project, although officials are not confirming that number.","Universal's ""Wizarding World"" officially opens Friday .

"(CNN) -- Federal agents and local police arrested 16 suspected gang members and associates in Greeley, Colorado, on Tuesday on drug and gun charges, according to a Department of Justice release. Those arrested were among 46 people indicted on federal charges of drug distribution and illegal gun possession, the release said. Eight people are considered fugitives and the others have been arrested since April or were in custody on other charges, Jeff Dorschner, a spokesman for the justice department said. During the 30-month investigation more than $500,000 worth of amphetamines (6.3 pounds of 100 percent pure meth) was seized. Cocaine, marijuana and mushrooms were also involved, according to the statement, which said 21 weapons also were seized. FBI Special Agent in Charge James Davis called those indicted ""some of the nation's most  notorious violent street offenders."" Officials didn't identify the gang affliations of those charged in the indictments but said most of the people charged were from Greeley while three were from California and one was thought to be in Mexico. Four of the people indicted have been charged with distribution in a school zone, and three have been charged with  distribution while a child under 18 is present. One person was charges with dealing drugs from home. ""The indictment of 46 people responsible for distributing meth and other dangerous drugs and illegally possessing firearms should have a serious negative impact on the drug trade in Greeley,"" U.S. Attorney David Gaouette said. The indictments listed 205 counts, one of which could lead to a life sentence. The Tuesday morning raids involved members of the the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and  Explosives; the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Greeley Police Department and the Weld County Sheriff's Department. Some of those who were arrested were taken Tuesday for their initial appearances at the U.S. District Court in Denver, while others will be taken there Wednesday. Greeley, a city of 90,000 residents, is about 60 miles north of Denver.","16 suspected gang members arrested in morning raids in Greeley, Colorado .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge on Thursday struck down the federal statute that established the National Day of Prayer, ruling that it violates the constitutional ban on government-backed religion. ""[I]ts sole purpose is to encourage all citizens to engage in prayer, an inherently religious exercise that serves no secular function,"" a Wisconsin judge wrote in the ruling, referring to the 1952 law that created the National Day of Prayer. ""In this instance, the government has taken sides on a matter that must be left to individual conscience,"" wrote the judge, Barbara B. Crabb. The injunction against the National Day of Prayer will not take effect until the defendants in the case, President Obama and White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, have exhausted their appeals, the decision said. The Obama administration said in a Twitter message on Thursday that Obama intends to recognize this year's National Day of Prayer, which is May 6. The White House press office referred a question about whether the administration would appeal the ruling to the Justice Department, where a press officer was unavailable for comment. Conservative religious groups called on the White House to appeal the decision. ""The National Day of Prayer provides an opportunity for all Americans to pray voluntarily according to their own faith and does not promote any particular religion or form of religious observance,"" said Joel Oster, senior legal counsel for the Alliance Defense Fund. Church-state separation groups, meanwhile, applauded the ruling. ""This decision is a tremendous victory for religious liberty,"" said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. ""Congress has no business telling Americans when or how to pray."" The Interfaith Alliance also welcomed the ruling. ""Maintaining clear boundaries between religion and government only serves to strengthen both,"" said the group's president, the Rev. Welton Gaddy. One constitutional scholar doubted the case would survive an appeal to a federal circuit court. ""Judges have never been absolutists in these establishment clause cases,"" said Douglas Laycock, a University of Michigan Law School professor specializing in religious liberties issues. ""If they were they would to tell the president to stop issuing Thanksgiving proclamations and tell the Treasury Department to take 'In God We Trust' off our money."" The lawsuit against the Obama administration was brought by the Freedom From Religion Foundation, a group based in Madison, Wisconsin. The statute that established the National Day of Prayer calls on the president to annually designate one day, other than a Sunday, ""on which the people of the United States may turn to God in prayer and meditation at churches, in groups and as individuals."" The law was amended in 1988 to designate the first Thursday in May as the annual National Day of Prayer. The event has been celebrated more ostentatiously by Republican than Democratic White Houses, partly because it has become aligned with religious conservatives. Since 1991, the National Day of Prayer Task Force has been led by Shirley Dobson, wife of conservative evangelical broadcaster and activist James Dobson. Shirley Dobson criticized the Obama administration last year for forgoing the White House celebrations that marked the National Day of Prayer under President George W. Bush. But Obama did issue an official proclamation designating a National Day of Prayer. ""Throughout our nation's history,"" Obama's proclamation read, ""Americans have come together in moments of great challenge and uncertainty to humble themselves in prayer.""","Judge says law violates constitutional ban on government-backed religion .

"Washington (CNN) -- On the face of it, the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and the growing threat of a disabling cyber attack would seem to have little in common. But experts have warned Congress that the inability of government and industry to prevent or respond to a cyber threat could be equally disastrous. A critical report from the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general released Wednesday concluded the agency responsible for protecting civilian computer and information networks was seriously understaffed and did not have the authority to order government agencies to protect their systems. Former DHS official Stewart Baker told the House Homeland Security Committee that the BP oil spill should be a valuable lesson to those developing cyber-security strategy. ""If we knew how bad things were, how many corners were cut before the oil spill, we would have demanded action on part of industry as well as the government. We know we face exactly that kind of crisis in the context of cyber security,"" said Baker. Rep. Jane Harman said it might even be worse. ""We could have a broken network or networks, spewing tens of thousands of bits of information on critical infrastructure, national security and mission critical data, financial and personal data, etc. It could be as devastating or more devastating than the environmental catastrophe that's unfolding on our TV sets,"" said the Democrat from California . The number of cyber intrusions is growing dramatically. According to a Government Accounting Office analysis, the number of security incidents reported by federal agencies increased more than 400 percent between 2006 and 2009. There were 278,000 indications of malicious activity per month targeting the civilian government cyber networks, DHS Assistant Secretary Gregory Schaffer told the committee. The U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) is the agency within DHS responsible for coordinating the government's efforts to defend against and respond to cyber attacks against the government's non-military systems. Inspector General Richard Skinner said US-CERT does not have the authority to enforce its recommendations to federal agencies, impeding the government's ability to move forward on cyber security. ""Until they have that authority or until they have mechanisms in place to ensure that compliance in fact is taking place, we're going to continue to experience problems,"" said Skinner. Schaffer acknowledged DHS does not have the authority to require a department or agency to correct a cyber vulnerability but when pressed by several lawmakers to identify what powers DHS needed, Schaffer would only say the administration is looking at the problem and did not have a position yet on specific authorities. The inspector general's report criticized US-CERT for not being sufficiently staffed to carry out its mission. The agency is authorized to have 98 positions, but only 55 have been filled and 25 people are awaiting security clearances. Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi, wanted to know why it will take two years to hire 80 people. Schaffer explained it is a difficult task because of competition within government and private industry for a very limited pool of highly skilled people. ""These people are not easily found,"" said Schaffer. The inspector general's report also cited another problem at US-CERT, the lack of sustained leadership. In the past five years, there have been four directors. Another area of concern cited by the inspector general is the use of Einstein, an intrusion detection software program developed by US-CERT and used to monitor federal computer networks. Skinner said only 21 agencies have Einstein installed in their infrastructure. ""We need to put pressure on federal partners to start taking cyber security a lot more seriously and start using the tools we've developed to help them secure their networks, communication systems and computers,"" said the inspector general. Committee Chairman Thompson wanted to know what could be done about complaints from federal agencies that DHS was not sharing enough of the data collected from Einstein concerning possible security breaches. Skinner said that is a complicated problem because a lot of the information is raw data and agencies may not have the capability to analyze it. Assistant Secretary Schaffer said DHS has a plan to expand the amount of information it shares with others, but it has to be done in a way that doesn't violate classification rules. Schaffer also agreed with Skinner that the high volume of raw data needs to be processed by highly skilled personnel who can analyze it and turn it into executable action. Skinner said US-CERT has made a lot of progress in implementing a cyber-security program, specifically citing information-sharing with the public and private sectors and increasing the skills and expertise of its staff. But he said a lot more needs to be done. ""The train has left the station. We are now chasing the problem instead of being ahead of it,"" said Skinner. Several Homeland Security Committee members on both sides of the aisle thought the bill introduced last week by Sens. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, would go a long way in getting the cyber security effort on track. That bill calls for a permanent White House cyber security coordinator, creates a National Center for Cybersecurity and Communications within DHS to lead federal efforts to protect government and private networks, and gives the president emergency powers to protect systems under attack.","GAO: Cyber-security incidents reported by federal agencies up 400 percent .

"(CNN) -- The Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine causes neither autism nor gastrointestinal disorders, a study reported Wednesday, disputing a theory that has persisted for a decade. A researcher had theorized that the measles vaccine caused gastrointestinal problems that he linked to autism. The theory was created in 1998, when British researcher Andrew Wakefield published studies that suggested the measles vaccine caused gastrointestinal problems and that those GI problems led to autism. W. Ian Lipkin of Columbia University in New York, who co-authored the most recent study, said Wakefield theorized that the virus used in the vaccine grew in the intestinal tract, leading to inflammation that made the bowel porous. That allowed material to seep from the bowel into the blood, Wakefield's theory surmised, affecting the nervous system and causing autism. In Wednesday's study, the researchers replicated key parts of Wakefield's original study to determine whether the vaccine causes autism and GI problems, said Mady Hornig, a study co-author. Irish pathologist John O'Leary, co-author of Wakefield's studies that supported the autism link, also is a co-author of the new study.  Watch and learn more about the study » . O'Leary and the other researchers looked for evidence of the measles vaccine in children's intestines after they had been vaccinated and sought to determine whether their GI problems and autism symptoms occurred before or after they were vaccinated. They analyzed samples taken from 38 children with bowel disorders, 25 of whom also had autism. The investigators found only one child in each group had trace amounts of the measles virus in their samples. The samples were analyzed at Columbia and at a laboratory of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as at O'Leary's lab -- the same one Wakefield used for his original studies. The conclusion: ""no evidence"" linked the vaccine to either autism or GI disorders, Lipkin said. They also said they found no relationship between the timing of the vaccine and children getting GI disorders or autism. ""This really puts this issue to bed,"" said Andy Shih, vice president for scientific affairs of ""Autism Speaks,"" an advocacy group. Dr. William Schaffner, vaccine expert and chairman of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University, called the study results ""conclusive.""  Watch more on the measles vaccine study » . Dr. Neal Halsey, a pediatrician at Johns Hopkins Children's Center who specializes in infectious diseases, told CNN, ""They have shown the Wakefield study was incorrect."" The new study shows ""there's no temporal relationship between the vaccines and the gastrointestinal disorders and autism."" But the Autism Society of America cautioned that the cause of autism is complex and more research is needed to fully understand the role, if any, of the vaccine. Another autism advocacy group, the National Autism Association (NAA), said the study is flawed. ""This new study does nothing to resolve the controversy whether MMR vaccine has contributed to the autism epidemic,"" said a press release from the group. Wendy Fournier, an NAA spokeswoman, told CNN Thursday that the new study raises more questions than answers and should have looked at more children who developed autism and GI problems after they received the vaccine. Only 5 children in the Columbia study were vaccinated before they developed GI symptoms and autism. According to the CDC, measles is a highly infectious disease that can result in severe, sometimes permanent, complications -- even death. Measles remains widespread in most countries, but widespread vaccination has limited its spread in the United States. Some parents, familiar with the Wakefield theory's putative link between vaccine and autism, have chosen not to vaccinate their children. Last month, the CDC reported 131 cases of measles in the United States in the first seven months of the year, of which 112 were either among unvaccinated children or children whose vaccination status was unknown. Halsey hopes this new research will help convince new parents that (the MMR) vaccination is safe. The study is published in the peer-reviewed online journal of the Public Library of Science, PLoS ONE.","Study disputes Wakefield theory linking vaccine to autism .

"(CNN) -- Every catastrophe has its unsung heroes. In BP's oil spill disaster, one such hero is not a person but a river: the Mississippi River. But the river's strength is flagging, and unless our leaders change what the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is doing, things could get a lot worse for our coastal marshes. Many people know that the Mississippi River flows through the Crescent City, New Orleans, Louisiana; but fewer are aware that this is only one of two paths it takes to the Gulf. The Mississippi divides to create its delta upstream of Baton Rouge at a place called Old River. The Atchafalaya River is the western channel. In 1963, the Corps built a dam with sluice gates at Old River between the Mississippi and Atchafalaya to keep the shorter Atchafalaya route from ""capturing"" the whole river. Later, they built more structures to gain better control. Today, every drop of water that goes down either the Mississippi or the Atchafalaya marches to the orders of the U.S. Army, which traditionally seeks to maintain a constant 70-to-30 percent split -- with the larger amount going to the main-stem Mississippi -- between the two river branches, by adjusting the gates at Old River on a daily basis. The Corps has the opportunity to sustain discharge on the main stem of the river by altering that rigid 70-30 ratio to, say, send 80 percent past New Orleans. If ever there were a time to switch off ""autopilot"" and utilize the power of one of our country's most powerful natural forces, it is now. All through May, the river's discharge past New Orleans increased as spring rains and melting snow from the center of the continent found their way into the river, rising to almost 1 million cubic feet per second. Like most coastal scientists familiar with the Mississippi River delta, I am convinced that this high spring discharge played an important role in keeping oil from penetrating deep into our marshes during the first full month of the spill. Discharge from the famous ""bird-foot"" river mouth has helped keep the oil offshore and to the east. Similarly, outflows from both banks of the channel through the gates of the Davis Pond and Caernarvon diversions and other engineered openings have helped to keep oil out of adjacent marshes and in the open bays where it could be collected. Louisiana's Gov. Bobby Jindal and his advisers showed good leadership in opening those diversions up to full bore as soon as the spill occurred, and that strategy appears to have paid off. But since the beginning of June, the flow past New Orleans has dropped by a third due to seasonal changes in climate. Now, it is likely we could see more extensive oiling of our coastal wetlands. With less water coming out of the river, more of the oil arriving on high tides will get deeper into the marshes, where most cleanup techniques do more harm than good. Can we keep river levels high for a little while longer, buying time for crews to attack the oil in open gulf and bay waters? Yes! The Mississippi is falling fast, but the Atchafalaya, which sends water to the coast 150 miles west of the main oil impacts, remains well above normal, as it has been most of this year. By closing some gates leading to the Atchafalaya, the Corps could send more water past New Orleans, out to those areas where the oil most threatens the marshes. These are the nursery grounds for most of the commercial fish and shrimp caught in the Gulf, and home to a wonderful variety of resident and migratory birds with declining populations. We need to do everything we can to save the marshes, including beginning to manage the river as if the future of the coast depends on it. It does. The Corps should seek emergency authority from President Obama, and the concurrence of Louisiana's Gov. Jindal, to quickly begin to operate the structures at Old River to address the drop in discharge on the main stem for at least the next two weeks. In the time of the endless oil disaster, all measures are temporary, whether ""top hats"" or ""sand berms."" Some work; most haven't. We have a limited opportunity to make a difference with the river, the most powerful tool in our kit. We don't know whether it will be tomorrow's high tide or one next week that brings in the next big dollop of oil, but increasing flow down the river past New Orleans sure makes sense right now. And as state and federal agencies begin to plan for long-term restoration of this precious ecosystem, I urge them to remember that we can't save the delta without the river. The Mississippi, the Atchafalaya, and yes, even the Old River structures have a role to play in restoring life and health to this region and all that it offers our nation and the world. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of G. Paul Kemp.

"(CNN) -- Ghana captain Stephen Appiah says the west African side will be ready for ""war"" when they face Australia at the World Cup in Rustenburg on Saturday. Germany's shock defeat by Serbia on Friday means that another win for the Black Stars in group D would put them firmly on course for a place in the last 16, following their 1-0 win over Serbia in their opening match. Australia were beaten 4-0 by Germany in their first game but Appiah and teammate John Mensah said they would not be taking the Socceroos lightly. ""Every country has their own style of play and the Australians are physically and mentally strong,"" Appiah told CNN. ""It's going to be a war, it's not going to be a football game. It's going to be really tough, but we're ready -- it's no problem."" Defender Mensah said Australia were a better team than their heavy defeat by Germany suggested. ""Just because they lost to Germany, that doesn't mean they're not good,"" Mensah told CNN. ""We don't underrate this Australian team. We will have to fight hard to get the three points."" Appiah said Ghana had benefited from the support of the South African fans and said there was ""unity"" between all the African sides at the first World Cup to be held on the continent. ""We are all excited to be in Africa to participate in this World Cup and we all hope to support African teams who are still playing,"" said Mensah. Ghana are without their best player and regular captain Michael Essien but Appiah said the Chelsea star was in touch with the squad every day. And he said the team could still do well, citing Ghana's run -- without Essien -- to the final of the Africa Cup of Nations in Angola. ""He is one of our key players.... But it doesn't mean that if one guy is not there the team is finished,"" Appiah said. Appiah admitted that the official Jabulani tournament ball was proving difficult to get used to but he said it would be good for players, with goalkeepers being caught out by its unpredictable movement. ""This football is a little bit strange and it's difficult when you get a long pass ... it's kind of swerving, so you don't know where the ball is going,"" he said. ""A lot of goalkeepers are complaining about this ball."" Despite beating Serbia, Appiah said the Ghanaians would not be getting carried away.

"New York (CNN) -- Her teachers knew she loved to doodle on her tests and homework, but no one thought Olivia Bouler's drawing skills would raise more than $110,000 to help birds affected by the Gulf oil spill. The 11-year-old wrote to the Audubon Society and told them she had an idea that could help raise money. ""I am a decent drawer, and I was wondering if I could sell some bird paintings and give the profits to your organization,"" the letter said. The idea got some attention. ""Many people are outraged and don't know where to vent that because they can't drive to the beach and help. So what Olivia has done has set a beautiful example by using her skills and creating an initiative that is fruitful for everyone,"" said . Delta Willis, the senior communications manager for The National Audubon Society. It was an innovative idea, but no one expected her efforts to pull in more than $90,000, and a $25,000 donation from AOL, after it signed on to host her initiative as part of AOL artists profiles. Olivia has promised to send original paintings to her first 500 donors who helped her raise $25,000. She's completed about half of them and plans to spend her summer sending out the remaining paintings. She's a resident of Islip, New York, but her father grew up in Orange Beach, Alabama, and she visits her grandparents as well as her cousins in Louisiana. Aside from her family, Olivia knew that the birds were also suffering from the oil spill in the Gulf. Olivia's mom, Nadine, said AOL contacted them after the initiative's Facebook page ""Save the Gulf: Olivia's Bird Illustrations"" caught the attention of media outlets. The AOL Artists profile page launched June 8, and donations have poured in over the past week. The Facebook page has more than 21,000 fans. Delta Willis has worked on conservation issues for 30 years and was amazed by Olivia's success. ""This is new to have this kind of outpouring of a response, it's very unique,"" Willis said. ""In my experience, I've never seen an outpouring like this. It's a beautiful gesture."" Olivia said that John James Audubon, the French-American ornithologist who painted and described the birds of North America in his book ""Birds of America,"" was her inspiration. Although Olivia says she took ""one little class"" on drawing, she has created about 180 paintings of different birds. After giving money to Olivia's initiative, donors can e-mail the receipt to Oliviasbirds@aol.com and they will receive one of five prints selected from the original paintings she has created. Most of her drawing experience comes from doodling on tests and homework. When Olivia sits down to make a painting, she leafs through the ""Cornell Lab of Ornithology Handbook of Bird Biology"" or the National Audubon Society Field Guide and reads facts about the birds. Olivia, who said she wants to attend Cornell University and be an ornithologist, told CNN that she became interested in birds at age 4 after she read a book on the topic. She's been hooked ever since. Olivia loves to go bird watching and names the American Kestrel and the Blue Jay as two of her favorites. The National Audubon Society had the first volunteers on the ground after they were called to the Gulf Coast by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Willis said. Members will use the donated money to support volunteers, staff and stock rehabilitation centers, and find transportation for the birds. Although they are limited by regulations stipulating who can touch the contaminated birds, volunteers can help transport the birds in containers to rehabilitation centers and patrol beaches looking for injured birds.

CNN has previously reported the person responsible for the threats was believed to be in Portugal. ""We thought we got him over the weekend, but it turns out we didn't,"" said one federal law enforcement source who asked not to be identified. However, a second official said the reports of Sharif's near-capture were untrue. But both officials agreed Sharif is the man they want. The FBI, which is leading the investigation into the threats, refused to comment on the identity of the suspect. Authorities have tied telephoned threats to at least 24 banks and stores in at least 15 states to Sharif and have confirmed that in some cases businesses paid ransoms in the face of the bomb threats, the sources told CNN. Federal investigators said a bank heist in Miami Beach in March may have marked the beginning of the telephone extortion attempts. In that case, authorities said an alleged accomplice walked into the bank with a suitcase, as a man telephoned from Portugal demanding the tellers give his on-the-scene associate $20,000. The alleged accomplice was arrested and faces federal charges in Florida. The FBI said the recent flurry of threatening calls from Portugal appears to have started in Portland, Oregon, in mid-August. The most recent calls were received Friday by a Wal-Mart store and grocery outlets in Ohio. Sharif is not a stranger to federal law enforcement officials. The Secret Service sought him on wire fraud charges for which he was indicted in New York in 2005, authorities said. The fugitive-hunting U.S. Marshals Service also acknowledged their interest in pursuing Sharif but declined to provide details. Federal authorities said they were getting good international cooperation in the case, and although there have been no bombs discovered and no injuries, each of the threatening calls has disrupted businesses and required intensive investigation by local police and federal agents.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a request Thursday to temporarily stay the execution of death row inmate Ronnie Lee Gardner, who is set to die before a Utah firing squad early Friday. The Supreme Court's rejection ended the last legal maneuver for Gardner, 49, who is scheduled to face execution shortly after midnight Friday (2 a.m. ET) for the shooting death of attorney Michael Burdell during a botched escape attempt from custody in 1985 at a Salt Lake City, Utah, courthouse. He would be only the third person to die by firing squad in the United States in 33 years. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert rejected two appeals by Gardner's attorneys to stop the execution, saying Gardner had every chance to present his case. ""Upon careful review, there is nothing in the materials provided this morning that has not already been considered and decided by the Board of Pardons and Parole or numerous courts,"" Herbert wrote in a letter to the attorneys rejecting the first appeal. ""Mr. Gardner has had a full and fair opportunity to have his case considered by numerous tribunals."" Among the claims Gardner raised in his appeals is that he has been a death row inmate too long. ""He asserts that executing him now, after nearly 25 years on death row in Utah, so lacks retributive or deterrent value that it violates the Eighth Amendment,"" Andrew Parnes, Gardner's lawyer, told the high court. He did not return phone calls from CNN seeking comment. A federal judge late Tuesday refused to block the execution, after Gardner claimed the procedures related to a two-day commutation hearing held by the state Board of Pardons and Parole last week violated his civil rights. The parole board Monday refused to commute Gardner's sentence to life in prison, and the Utah Supreme Court on Tuesday also denied his request for a stay. Gardner testified before the board he is a changed man, and his sentence should be commuted. That was the issue before the 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Denver, which concluded the clemency hearings were conducted fairly and did not violate the inmate's civil rights. ""There is no merit to the claims asserted in the underlying [civil rights claim] challenging the procedures followed in Mr. Gardner's state clemency proceeding,"" wrote the three-judge panel. ""In light of that fundamental deficiency, Mr. Gardner's associated application for a stay of his execution was also meritless."" He is set to become the third person to die by rifle fire, all in Utah, since the Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976. He had a long history of escapes and was slipped a gun before he fatally shot Burdell on April 2, 1985. He was at the courthouse for a pre-trial hearing in the 1984 slaying of Melvyn Otterstrom, who was killed at the Salt Lake City bar where he was working to earn extra money. The execution will be held at the Utah State Prison in Draper, about 20 miles south of Salt Lake City. Corrections officials announced Gardner had consumed his last meal Tuesday night at 6:30 p.m., and has elected to fast prior to the anticipated execution. His dinner included steak, lobster, 7-Up, apple pie and vanilla ice cream. As he awaited execution, Gardner watched the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy in an observational cell and read a novel by David Baldacci entitled ""Divine Justice,"" said Utah Department of Corrections spokesman Steve Gehrke. In the hours before the scheduled execution, Gardner met with a bishop from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Gehrke said. During the commutation hearing, parole board members heard testimony regarding Gardner's childhood, which was punctuated by poverty, abuse and neglect. Parnes maintained that jurors in the Burdell trial never heard this evidence -- and presented affidavits from jurors who said it might have persuaded them to decide against the death penalty. Life in prison without the possibility of parole was not an option for jurors at the time, and Parnes said it was suggested to the jury that Gardner might be released from prison at some point if he were given a life sentence. Gardner pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in Otterstrom's death, and jurors were not told of a judge's recommendation in that case that he not be released from prison, Parnes said. Utah is the only state that uses the firing squad as a current execution method. Oklahoma allows it only if lethal injection and electrocution are ruled unconstitutional. Forty of Utah's 49 executions in the last 160 years or so have been done this way, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. State lawmakers made lethal injection the default capital punishment in 2004, but at least three inmates who already had chosen the firing squad were grandfathered in under the new law. Five anonymous marksmen will use matching .30-caliber rifles, standing behind a wall cut with five gunports. One of the rifles will be an ""ineffective"" round, similar to a blank, which delivers the same recoil as a live round. That ensures none of the riflemen will know who delivered the fatal shot. The marksmen fire from a distance of 25 feet. The inmate is blindfolded, strapped to a chair and a target pinned to his chest.

There have been no oil effects in Panama City Beach, Florida, and the area's beaches and waters are open, the  Panama City Beach Convention and Visitors Bureau website said. The water at Pensacola Beach is also open for swimming and fishing, according to the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. ""On Pensacola Beach there are reports of tar balls and sheen on less than one percent of the entire beach,"" the bureau's website said. Due to heavier oiling on Perdido Key, a health advisory has been issued for beaches stretching from the Florida-Alabama line to the entrance of Johnson Beach on Perdido Key, the Pensacola Bay Area visitors bureau said. Swimming and fishing in the affected waters are not advised. Gulf Islands National Seashore . All of the Gulf Islands National Seashore beaches, which are in Florida and Mississippi, are open, the National Park Service's website said. In Florida, Fort Pickens and Perdido Key had increased oiling earlier in the week. Tar balls and light oiling have affected Petit Bois and Horn islands this week in Mississippi. ""Surveillance for oiling continues throughout all park areas on a daily basis. Clean-up operations continue throughout the park,"" the website said. Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama . Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama, have experienced significant oiling, according to the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau. The beaches remain open for sunbathing and walking, but both cities are flying double red flags at public beaches, meaning the waters are closed for swimming or wading. The Alabama Department of Public Health has issued an advisory against swimming in waters off Gulf Shores, Orange Beach and Fort Morgan or in bay waters close to Fort Morgan, Bayou St. John, Terry Cove, Cotton Bayou and Old River.

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- On the first day of school after the earthquake, Medlika Rameau told her classmates about how she was trapped in the rubble of her house with her mother and little sister. Rameau's leg was pinned under concrete. Her mother wanted rescuers to amputate her left leg so she could be pulled out. ""I prefer to die with my two legs,"" said the 13-year-old Wednesday, looking down at her small feet in flowery flip flops. When she heard her mother screaming and crying, she made one last push to get her leg out and free herself. She managed to escape with a big gash, now neatly bandaged. She recounted her story from a makeshift classroom in the cemetery of a Catholic retreat center in the badly damaged neighborhood of Sainte Marie. For Rameau and 400 other fellow students, Wednesday returned a huge sense of normalcy to their lives: school. While aid groups have been delivering water, food and hygiene items to quake-devastated Haitians, few have received counseling for bearing witness to horror. Among them, tens of thousands of children -- some already impoverished and vulnerable -- who now must live with the added burden of terrible memories. Counselors from Israeli aid agency Natan I-Relief have been training the young teachers at Sainte Marie, who themselves suffered in the earthquake, on how to cope with their experiences. The first step: Talk about it. One by one on Wednesday, each child rose in their makeshift classrooms -- some in the open, some in tents with damaged tables salvaged from the wreckage of their old school. They recounted how they lost mothers, fathers and their homes and they talked about the bleakness of life under a makeshift tent. Many came to school with physical injuries. Psychologist Moshe Farchi described a ""golden month"" that was critical in the prevention of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. If survivors can talk through what they experienced and return to some semblance of routine within a month after tragedy, they are more likely to recover, he said. ""What's most important is they try to go back to a routine,"" said Farchi, whose aid group has been working at the school and Catholic retreat center in Sainte Marie since the earthquake. In that sense, a resumption of classes was vital. Farchi encourages teachers to help the children piece together a chronology of what happened. Otherwise, he said, ""there's no putting an end to the story."" The next step is to take control of their lives again; to not think of themselves as victims, but as survivors. Some children were afraid to even use the word earthquake. They called it ""the thing."" It's another way of avoiding dealing with pain, Farchi said. ""We encourage them to say words like 'earthquake' and 'falling houses,' "" he said. ""To say that people were killed."" An estimated 5,000 schools in Port-au-Prince were destroyed or damaged in the January 12 earthquake. Some privately run schools that are able to supply a safe space for classes, including Sainte Marie, were allowed to reopen this week. But it will take months to get the school system, among the world's poorest, up and running again. The students at Sainte Marie were happy to be back in class. Even though their building was gone, school was the only thing about their lives that still seemed the same -- to see their teachers and play with friends. ""It's as if they were thirsting for school,"" said teacher Jacques Junior Mathieu. They have come a long way, said Farchi, who described the children as quiet and reserved the first time he saw them almost three weeks ago. They were afraid to stray far from their parents. They rarely smiled. ""First aid to the soul is no less important than physical wounds and may be much more difficult to attend,"" said Amos Radian, the Israeli ambassador to Haiti, visiting the school Wednesday. Radian said the Israelis plan to rebuild the collapsed school and construct a community center that will include a clinic and after-school program. The school bell clanged and the sound of laughter filled the air. Teacher Claire Marie Oculien stepped inside her classroom tent with a warmth she said she hasn't felt in a while. She chose this profession because she loves children. She returned to work as soon as she could, despite having lost her home and family members, because she wanted to do her part as a Haitian. ""Without education, there is no future for Haiti. These children are very courageous,"" she said after listening to some of their stories. One of her students, Vanessa Saint-Louis, said she was studying when the earth began to shake. The 9-year-old's mother died and her aunt takes care of her now. Then, she sat back down and rested her head on the shoulder of the girl next to her.","Haitians are receiving aid in form of water, food, but few have received counseling .

"(CNN) -- A BP estimate made after the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon noted that as much as 100,000 barrels per day could leak into the ocean if the blowout preventer and wellhead were removed, a higher worst-case scenario than previously reported. According to an internal BP document released Sunday by Rep. Edward Markey, D-Massachusetts, BP believed that the worst-case scenario could be as high as 100,000 barrels, or 4.2 million gallons of oil per day. The figure is the highest yet to surface regarding the leaking oil well. At the disaster's outset, BP claimed the leak was about 1,000 barrels a day, a number it later revised to 5,000 and then much higher. BP told the House Energy and Commerce Committee that the worst-case scenario was 60,000 barrels (2.5 million gallons) a day, lower than what the document states. The document, submitted in May, maintains the 60,000 barrel estimate, but stipulates that if the ""blowout preventer and wellhead are removed and if we have incorrectly modeled the restrictions, the rate could be as high as 100,000 barrels a day."" Markey said the document ""raises very troubling questions about what BP knew and when they knew it."" ""It is clear that, from the beginning, BP has not been straightforward with the government or the American people about the true size of this spill,"" said Markey, the chairman of the Energy and Environment Subcommittee in the House Energy and Commerce Committee. ""Considering what is now known about BP's problems with this well prior to the Deepwater Horizon explosion, including cementing issues, leaks in the blowout preventer and gas kicks, BP should have been more honest about the dangerous condition of the well bore,"" Markey said in a statement. BP spokesman Robert Wine said the May estimate cited in Markey's document is irrelevant to the current situation because the oil company has no intention of removing the well's blowout preventer. ""The allegation doesn't make sense,"" Wine told CNN. ""Why on earth would we remove the blowout preventer when it's sitting on top of the sea well and providing some control (of the spill)?"" Toby Odone, another spokesman for BP, added that the blowout preventer will be removed only when the well is completely killed. A blowout preventer is designed to seal off a well in the event of an emergency, but the device has not been working since the April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon. Also Sunday, while cleanup crews and technical teams continued efforts to stop crude gushing into the Gulf, Louisiana lawmakers proposed a different approach: prayer. State senators designated Sunday as a day for citizens to ask for God's help dealing with the oil disaster. ""Thus far efforts made by mortals to try to solve the crisis have been to no avail,"" state Sen. Robert Adley said in a statement released after last week's unanimous vote for the day of prayer. ""It is clearly time for a miracle for us."" The resolution names Sunday as a statewide day of prayer in Louisiana and calls on people of all religions throughout the Gulf Coast ""to pray for an end to this environmental emergency, sparing us all from the destruction of both culture and livelihood."" Also Sunday, wildlife officials were planning to transport and release 40 pelicans that rescuers rehabilitated after finding them covered with oil. The birds will be moved from New Orleans, Louisiana, to the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in Port Aransas, Texas. As much as 60,000 barrels (2.5 million gallons) of oil may be gushing into the Gulf every day, new government estimates found last week. BP said it was able to capture roughly 8,480 barrels of oil from midnight to 12 p.m. Saturday. The company said it captured 24,500 barrels -- just over a million gallons -- of oil Friday, a little less than it captured the day before. BP said Saturday that it has paid $104 million to residents along the Gulf Coast who have filed claims related to the Gulf oil spill, issuing more than 31,000 checks in the past seven weeks. There was no immediate response from local, state or federal officials to BP's tally of its payments. Meanwhile, oil recovery efforts in the Gulf resumed Saturday morning on the drill ship Discoverer Enterprise, after work was suspended for about 10 hours because of a mechanical problem. A venting device aboard the drilling ship was not working properly, said Ayla Kelley, spokesperson for the Deepwater Horizon command center. Other recovery efforts continued during the time that the Discoverer Enterprise was idled, she said. She said the problem was with a blocked flame arrester, designed to prevent oil from combusting by extinguishing the flame.","NEW: BP calls worst-case estimate irrelevant .

"New York (CNN) -- John Lennon's autographed lyrics for ""A Day in the Life"" -- one of the top tunes from an iconic album -- went for more than a song Friday when it was sold at Sotheby's Auction house in New York for $1,202,500. The price paid by a private American collector is close to the sale price in 2005 when Lennon's lyrics for ""All you need is Love"" sold for over $1.2 million. A total of three bidders weighed in for the manuscript, taking over six minutes until the bidding ended. The double-sided single sheet of paper written in Lennon's hand includes cross-outs and corrections, and chronicles the evolution of one of the most famous musical masterpieces by the Beatles. ""A Day in the Life"" was the final track of the Beatles' legendary 1967 album, ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."" The album spent 27 weeks at the top of the British charts and 15 weeks at number one on the American Billboard 200. The album is considered a turning point in the career of the Beatles, transforming them from pop icons to among the 20th century's leading artists. Rolling Stone magazine has ranked ""A Day in the Life"" as number 26 in its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Rolling Stone Assistant Editor Andy Greene thinks the song and the album deserve higher praise, considering it was the last album the Beatles collectively worked on together. ""That album was the beginning of the Album Era,"" said Greene. ""It was the Big Bang of albums. This was the first concept album. All the songs go together to tell a story and it's inspired every musician."" The lyrics, once owned by Mal Evans, the Beatles' road manager, exceeded Sotheby's estimates of $500,000 to $700,000. The lyrics were sold by an unidentified collector, an American, who purchased the sheet in 1992 at Sotheby's for £48,000, or $93,000. The auction house said the seller plans to use the proceeds to buy a vineyard. The first side of the lyrics -- which are believed to have been composed on the morning and afternoon of January 17, 1967 -- features a rough draft written in script with a black felt marker and blue ballpoint pen, with a few annotations in red ink. The other side of the page, whose ink is also bright and vibrant, is written in block letters, according to Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy. Both versions begin with the same familiar line: ""I read the news today, oh boy."" Rolling Stone's Greene didn't seem fazed by the expected sale price for the lyrics. ""I can see why it's worth that,"" he said. ""Beatles stuff always sells well. It is the crown jewel of the Beatles collection.""","Double-sided sheet of paper sells for $1,202,500 .

"Minneapolis, Minnesota (CNN) -- Attorney Brian O'Neill has a lifetime of experience when it comes to the legal battles that ensue following major oil catastrophes. After the Exxon Valdez oil tanker crashed in Prince William Sound in 1989, O'Neill headed straight to Alaska. The Minnesota-based attorney had an interest in environmental issues and wanted to help because, as he put it, ""there were an awful lot of hurt people."" He soon represented 2,600 fishermen and others affected by the spill. What he thought would be a two- or three-year ""adventure"" is still the biggest thing on his plate, one-third of his life later. O'Neill successfully argued the 1994 trial after which a jury ordered Exxon to pay $5.3 billion in punitive damages to O'Neill's clients and others affected by the spill. Exxon appealed almost two dozen times and O'Neill was there through it all. In 2008, the case reached the U.S. Supreme Court, where a 5-3 majority finally set punitive damages at $500 million. It was a significant blow to O'Neill and his clients. Today, O'Neill is working to make sure each of his clients receives the remainder of their payments from Exxon, which he expects will be complete by year end. O'Neill spoke with CNN in his downtown Minneapolis office at the Faegre & Benson law firm about the similarities between the Exxon Valdez situation, and the current disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. CNN: What are some of the key similarities you see between the two spills? O'Neill: The noise and the feeling that you get now is the same as the noise and the feeling that you got in the early days of the Valdez spill, with people saying the same thing and people reacting the same way. It's going to be interesting when the limelight is no longer on the Gulf as to how BP is going to act and how the federal and state governments are going to act. Because once this is no longer on the front page of the newspaper, everybody's reaction is going to be 'We need oil.' Oil runs the universe, and you can see governments settling with BP relatively cheaply and you can see BP at some point in time changing its attitude from 'We'll pay you' to 'We'll pay you if the court tells us to pay you.' CNN: This week, BP agreed to set aside a $20 billion escrow account to compensate U.S. businesses and workers who have been adversely affected by the Gulf oil spill.  What are your thoughts on that? O'Neill: I hope what it means is that they're going to take $20 billion and set up a fund for victims and that you'll go to the fund and that they'll pay you interim money and then they'll pay you final money. That's my hope. And for a lot of the plaintiffs, they may not need to ever go to court, so they're not going to get tied up for 20 years. [In that regard] it would be really positive. If they're successful in starting to move money quickly, it'll be a huge success, but if they're going to pay anywhere from 30,000 to 100,000 people, that's awfully tricky. And it's going to take a lot of work and a lot of money to set this thing up quickly, and it only works if you set it up quickly ... For a lot of these people who live from year to year on their fishing businesses, they could be bankrupt by the end of the year. So that's what we have to do is we've got to get money to them quickly. CNN: Did anything surprise you once you started representing the fishermen and taking on Exxon after the Valdez spill? O'Neill: I thought that -- like a lot of people think now with regard to BP -- that Exxon would want to settle the case relatively early and move on and I was surprised a number of times with the fact that this was World War III to them, and they dealt with it that way ... They spent over $400 million on lawyers, essentially defending [against] our claims. They took every appeal they could take and they took every delay they could take and filed every motion they could take. Don't kid yourself: the oil companies have the best lawyers money can buy. CNN: Is that one of the most important things you think people in the Gulf should keep in mind when thinking about filing a claim? O'Neill: I think that they should -- if they have a claim --file a claim with BP and see if BP will pay it. If BP doesn't pay it I think they ought to go to the federal oil spill fund and see if the oil spill fund will pay it, and then if they have to file suit with the knowledge that it's gonna be a long haul ... make absolutely sure they're not giving up any legal rights. The major problem they face other than the legal system is that they don't know how hard they've been hit yet. You could say to yourself, if you're a shrimper, 'Well I haven't fished for the last month.' But what happens if this toxic oil does something to that fishery? Or what happens if the presence of that toxic oil does something to the price of Gulf shrimp around the world? You're not going to know the answer to some of those things for two or three or four years. So you have to settle part of your case now if you can ... because the scope of the harm to you is unknown. It's as unknown as where that oil is going to go. CNN: You mentioned the legal system would be one of their biggest problems: can you elaborate on that? O'Neill: Well if a company is rich enough and powerful enough to hire hundreds of lawyers they can essentially bring the legal system to a halt. They can. Most of these fishermen no longer believe that the court system of the United States provides equal justice. They've come to a conclusion that is the same as the conclusion that I've come to, and that is that our governmental institutions will always bail out big oil, and they did here. CNN: Do you think oil still has that great of an influence today? O'Neill: It's more than the influence that oil has. It's whoever controls oil rules the world. The fact that you came downtown in a car that needs oil [and the fact that] the electricity in the office is probably the result of oil are everyday reminders of the strategic importance of oil to the United States, and if you're a judge or you're the president...you're aware of the fact that you need BP and Exxon, so why the heck would you punish BP or Exxon in any way that impairs their ability to survive? You wouldn't, no matter how many people they hurt. CNN: Do you have any regrets from this case? O'Neill: I regret that I haven't done a lot of other professional things for the last 21 years, I do. It was never my plan to be a trial lawyer until I was 63 years old. I was going to go off and do something else, teach law school probably. But I didn't get the chance to do that so that's my biggest regret.

"(CNN) -- Cameroon became the first team to be eliminated from the World Cup in South Africa after Saturday's 2-1 defeat by Denmark, which made the Netherlands the first team to reach the second round following an earlier 1-0 victory over Japan. African teams had held high hopes ahead of the first tournament to be held on the continent, but Cameroon are going home early after a second successive defeat and the hosts are also on the verge of exiting following Wednesday's 3-0 loss to Uruguay. Cameroon took the lead through star striker Samuel Eto'o, but Denmark rallied thanks to an inspirational performance from winger Dennis Rommedahl, who made one goal and scored the winner. The Dutch are top of Group E after two victories thanks to Wesley Sneijder's second-half winner in Durban, while Denmark and Japan will determine the second team to reach the knockout stages when they clash on Thursday, both having three points. Japan have a slightly better goal difference and can qualify with a draw. Denmark 2-1 Cameroon . Cameroon star Eto'o has been one of the poster faces of the tournament, and he became the fourth player from his country to score at more than one World Cup after being restored to his more customary central striking role by coach Paul Le Guen. The Inter Milan forward punished the Danish defense after Christian Poulsen inexplicably gave the ball away to Pierre Webo in the 10th minute in Pretoria. The lead lasted just 23 minutes as Rommedahl broke free down the right and delivered a superb low cross into the path of striker Nicklas Bendtner, who slid the ball into the net. That triggered a frantic end to the half as Jon Dahl Tomasson had a goalbound shot blocked by Cameroon midfielder Alex Song, who had given the ball away in the first place, then Eto'o hit the post after a similar chain of events at the other end and Achille Emana ineffectually flicked the ball at Danish goalkeeper Thomas Sorensen when he should have scored. In the second half, Webo missed a chance to go ahead and Cameroon immediately went behind as Bendtner set up Rommedahl on the counter-attack. The veteran winger cut inside a retreating Jean Makoun and curled in a left-foot effort, with Cameroon full-back Benoit Assou-Akotto caught out of position in the other half. Denmark should have added to that 61st-minute goal but captain Tomasson shot straight at goalkeeper Hamidou Souleymanou after clever play by Rommedahl on 70. Cameroon kept pouring forward in a brave attempt to stay in the tournament, and Poulsen inadvertently made a crucial block with his face from a goalbound shot by 18-year-old substitute Vincent Aboubakar while Sorensen did well to deny Emana again. ""We missed the required coolness in front of goal,"" Le Guen told reporters. ""We didn't finish very well, but I feel like we gave everything we could."" Denmark coach Morten Olsen was not impressed by his team's performance. ""We made far too many elementary mistakes and I can't allow that from my players. We must correct that,"" he said. ""I wasn't happy, but they fought heroically. Some didn't play well, but they fought."" Netherlands 1-0 Japan . Midfielder Sneijder scored the only goal at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in the 53rd minute with a vicious, swerving shot that deceived Japan goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima, who could only palm the much-criticized Jabulani ball into his own net. The Dutch, two-times losing finalists in soccer's showpiece event, should have made it 2-0 late on in the game when substitute Ibrahim Afellay -- who replaced Inter Milan star Sneijder -- was denied by Kawashima after latching onto a through ball from Eljero Elia. Japan, who created a number of half-chances throughout the match, had a good opportunity to equalize in the dying seconds of the game, but substitute Shinji Okazaki shot narrowly over the bar. The Netherlands, again missing injured star forward Arjen Robben, struggled to break down a tenacious Japan side much as they did in the first half against Denmark before going on to win that match 2-0 thanks to a fortunate own-goal. Dirk Kuyt was closest to scoring when his spectacular overhead effort was blocked, while Japan's best chance -- despite several impressive attacking moves -- was a 38th-minute volley from Daisuke Matsui that was comfortably saved by Dutch keeper Maarten Stekelenburg. Japan's play assumed more urgency following Sneijder's thunderbolt, but they could not turn industrious forward play into any clear-cut chances to worry the Dutch defense.","Netherlands become the first team to reach second round of the World Cup in South Africa .

"(CNN)  -- France's World Cup squad boycotted training on Sunday in protest at the decision to send home star striker Nicolas Anelka. In a bizarre twist, coach Raymond Domenech had to read out a statement from the team to explain their decision. ""All players without exception want to declare their opposition to FFF (French Football Federation) decision to exclude Nicolas Anelka,"" he said. ""For its part, the FFF has at no time tried to protect the group. ""They made a decision without consulting all the players, only on the basis of the 'facts' reported by the press."" ""Accordingly, and to mark their opposition to the highest level of French football, all players decided not to participate in the work-out."" Anelka sent home after Domenech row . Despite their refusal to train, the players added that they would ""do everything individually and in a collective spirit so that France regains its honor against South Africa on Tuesday."" France must beat the hosts and hope the result of the other match in Group A between Mexico and Uruguay goes their way to have any chance of qualifying for the last 16. Their hopes were dealt a near fatal blow by a 2-0 defeat to the Mexicans on Thursday, after which it emerged that Chelsea star Anelka and under fire coach Domenech had a massive row at halftime. Anelka was substituted but reports of his tirade against Domenech were picked up by the media, prompting the French Football Federation to take the decision to send him home on Saturday. Captain Patrice Evra was incensed by the leak, claiming there was a ""traitor"" in the French camp. As the squad came on to the training ground at Knysna on Sunday, Domenech and Evra were still in discussion on the team bus. The pair eventually emerged, but Evra then became involved in a shouting match with fitness coach Robert Duverne, who reacted by angrily throwing down his official accreditation badge. The squad, who said they only turned out to greet fans, promptly walked off and were joined by Domenech on the bus, after which he emerged to read out the statement. To add to the chaos, a distraught France team director Jean-Louis Valentin publicly announced his resignation to the media. ""Ask the players, they do not want to involve themselves any more. It's unacceptable,"" he told AFP. ""They don't want to train. It's a scandal for the French, it's a scandal for the federation and the French team. ""It is a shame. As for me, it's over. I'm leaving the federation. I'm sickened and disgusted."" Mexico sink sorry France . 2006 runners-up France have picked up just one point from their two games, a dull goalless draw with Uruguay. But it was the lackluster display against Mexico which provoked a storm of criticism, much of it directed at Domenech, who is standing down after the World Cup finals. Domenech, who is being replaced by Laurent Blanc, told the French Football Federation official website that Anelka could have stayed had he apologized for his halftime remarks. ""I had another chat with him (Anelka) the next day and I left open the possibility for him to apologise, something which he did not want to do,"" he said. ""The decision to exclude him was the right one. He does not have the right to say such things.""","France squad boycott training on Sunday in protest at decision to send home Nicolas Anelka .

"(CNN) -- Australia drew 1-1 with World Cup opponents Ghana despite playing with 10 men for over an hour of Saturday's Group D clash in Rustenburg. The result put Ghana in pole position to qualify for the second round in South Africa, with four points from two games. Serbia's shock win over Germany on Friday left both sides on three points, while Australia prop up the table with just one. Australia's key player Harry Kewell, returning from long-term injury, was shown a straight red card by Italian referee Roberto Rosetti in the 24th minute after being adjudged to have deliberately blocked a goalbound shot from Ghana's Jonathan Mensah with his arm. Brett Holman had given Australia -- who had Tim Cahill sent off in their opening defeat by Germany -- the lead in the 11th minute, capitalizing on a mistake by Ghana goalkeeper Richard Kingson. Kingson failed to gather a ball from Mark Bresciano's 30-yard free-kick, and Holman pounced on the rebound and fired home from close range. Going a goal down galvanized the Ghanaians, who embarked upon a series of promising attacks. The Black Stars' pressure eventually told when they were awarded a penalty in for Kewell's misdemeanor. When the distraught Galatasaray midfielder eventually left the pitch, Asamoah Gyan -- who scored the winning penalty in Ghana's first World Cup match against Serbia -- made no mistake from the spot. Ghana were denied a halftime lead when Kevin Prince Boateng's surging run into the penalty area ended with a low shot, but Socceroos keeper Mark Schwarzer dived low to his right to pull off a fine save. Ghana continued to press forward in the second half but failed to make their man advantage tell. And as second half wore on their shooting became increasingly speculative and wild, although substitute Quincy Owusu Abeyie forced a save from Schwarzer in injury-time. Luke Wilkshire should have put Australia ahead again in the 72nd minute when he was clean through on goal, but the midfielder shot straight at Kingson, who parried the ball away. Substitute striker Joshua Kennedy was on hand for the rebound, but could only scuff his effort into the ground, allowing Kingson time to gather the ball. After the match, Australia's coach Pim Verbeek conceded that his team's chances of reaching the next round of the competition were slim, but he refused to give up hope. ""The next game we have to win at least 3-0. We are still in the race, but it will be quite difficult,"" he told the BBC. ""But I'm really proud of the players, I think playing with 10 players for such a long time was not easy.""","Australia and Ghana draw 1-1 in Group D match in Rustenburg .

"(CNN) -- Oprah Winfrey gave her support to those suffering in the Gulf states, saying President Obama is doing the best he can to handle the oil disaster. ""What's going on in my heart is the same thing, everyone feels for what is happening to all of the fisherman and families who, this time of year, would be hosting people from all over the country and all over the world there,"" said Winfrey, who was in Atlanta, Georgia, on Wednesday to speak at a middle school graduation. ""We can only hope and pray that this will soon be resolved in a way that people can pick themselves up and move forward,"" Winfrey added. The talk show host said she has heard the criticism of Obama's handling of the oil crisis. Winfrey, an avid supporter of the president, said he is doing a good job. ""I think the president is doing the best anybody can,"" said Winfrey, who campaigned for Obama when he ran for president. ""I really don't understand what people want him to do? I think he's the president of the United States. ""You're not supposed to be emotional, you're supposed to take action and get things done and make sure those things happen so I'm not sure what people want him to do,"" she said. The underwater gusher began after an April 20 explosion aboard the drilling rig Deepwater Horizon. The explosion and subsequent fire caused the rig to sink two days later, rupturing the pipes and sending oil spilling from the well. Winfrey said she has been saddened by television reports of those affected by the oil disaster. ""What is happening not only to the people but to the animals is what breaks my heart,"" Winfrey said.

"(CNN) -- The enduring beauty of the U.S. Open has little to do with the golf course on which it is played in a given year. (Although the course in Pebble Beach, California, where the final round of this year's Open is scheduled to be played Sunday, is quite a looker.) But the thing that sets the Open apart from other top-tier championship events in big-time sports is this: . You can play your way into it. If you're watching the Open on television this weekend, and you're a good golfer with a handicap low enough to prove it, and you're saying to yourself: ""Man, would I like to be out there competing in that thing. . . ."" Well, if you're an unknown who's not a part of the sport's elite, and you want to give it a try and you do well enough, you'll be there. Dozens of golfers do it every year. It's what makes the Open perhaps the sporting event whose rulebook best represents the American ideal. There are other tournaments that open their doors to non-marquee competitors; the British Open holds qualifying rounds, and this year the U.S. Tennis Association has instituted a feature similar to the U.S. Golf Association's qualifying system. But nothing can compare with the scope and the spirit of inclusiveness of the pathway that leads to golf's U.S. Open. Every year, numerous spots in the Open are reserved for players who think they're good enough to compete with the most famous names in the game.  This year, local qualifying rounds were held on more than 100 golf courses.  More than 9,000 golfers filled out entry forms. A big, guaranteed chunk of the spots in the Open was, as always, given to established stars who are exempt from having to qualify, having proven themselves in other prestigious golf events. But at those 100-plus local qualifying courses, and at sectional qualifying courses that were the next level, the thousands of dreamers were welcomed. They couldn't just stroll in and tee off. They had to have demonstrated that they were serious and skilled golfers; professionals (both playing pros and teaching pros) are eligible to compete in the qualifying rounds, and amateurs must meet a handicapping formula devised by the USGA. But once they stepped up to the first tee,  the only thing between them and Pebble Beach was how well they played on those local and sectional courses.  And once the best of them arrived at Pebble Beach, the playing field was absolutely level.  According to USGA officials, half of the 156 competitors at the Open this year got there through the qualifying rounds. They were looking out at the same 18 holes as golf's current legends were. The appeal of this is that, to get into the U.S. Open through the qualifying rounds, there are no admissions committees peering down their noses at you; there is no one in an executive office telling you there's no room for you to try. You don't have to know anyone with influence in the high echelons of golf; you don't have to be recruited by anyone; you don't have to have an agent. You just have to have your game, and your belief in yourself. I'm not a golfer; never have been. But I think the reason I have always so admired the tradition of the U.S. Open's qualifying rounds is that there was someone from my hometown who, at the age of 17, played himself into the Open that way. Just four years earlier, when he was 13, he'd had polio. But he recovered, and he fought through it, and he willed himself to excel. I know that a lot of you probably have stories about tenacious golfers from your own towns who made it to the U.S. Open one year. But the 17-year-old from our town was pretty special. His name was Jack W. Nicklaus; he didn't make the 36-hole cut at the Open that first year he qualified, but by three years later, in 1960, at age 20, he was paired in the final rounds with Ben Hogan. In 1962 he won the Open, the first of his 18 major championships. After qualifying in that first year, he would play in 44 consecutive U.S. Opens. For decades, on warm summer weekend afternoons, you could walk around his hometown and you would almost inevitably hear a sound coming from one screened-in porch or another. It was someone who lived in the house, calling out: ""Get up, Jack!"" Nicklaus would be somewhere in the country, somewhere in the world, playing in a tournament, and he had just struck his putt, and here, back home, as on TV the ball rolled toward the cup, the person in the house would be cheering for him, willing that ball toward the hole: ""Get up, Jack!"" He may be the best golfer who ever lived, but once he was a boy, an Ohio pharmacist's son, dreaming of making it to the U.S. Open. He played his way in, as so many did before him, as so many have after. It's the essential magic of the Open. And on Sunday, as the drama of the final round at Pebble Beach unfolds, somewhere in the United States someone will be sitting in front of a television set, thinking: I'm good enough to be there. If he's right, and he wants it badly enough to go after it, next June the U.S. Open is exactly where he'll be. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene says the U.S. Open has a special quality among top sports events .

"(CNN)  -- Fabio Capello's England were held to a disappointing goalless draw by Algeria in their World Cup Group C clash in Cape Town on Friday night. Following the earlier 2-2 draw between Slovenia and the United States, it means all four teams can still qualify for the last 16 knockout stage. England will play group leaders Slovenia and the U.S. take on Algeria, whose confidence will be boosted after keeping Capello's men at bay. The Italian showed his ruthless streak by dropping goalkeeper Robert Green, after his blunder cost England dear in a 1-1 draw with the U.S. in their group opener. His replacement David James was scarcely called into action after an early mis-punch which seemed to sum up a nervy England display. Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard had their best chance in the first half but saw his effort from 10 meters out well saved by M'bohi Rais Ouheb, who had an excellent game in the Algeria goal. With England's talisman Wayne Rooney again kept in check, they were only a shadow of the team which breezed through qualifying and entered the tournament as one of the favorites. Capello, who surely could have  found better ways to celebrate his 64th birthday, was perplexed by his team's display. ""This is not the team I recognize from training or from qualifying,"" he told ITV Sport. ""We missed too many passes, lost too many balls. It was not a good game. We have to do better. ""We have another game to play. It's our last chance to continue in the tournament. The players know what they have to do."" Earlier, the United States came back from two goals behind to draw 2-2 with Slovenia in a pulsating encounter in Johannesburg. First half goals from midfielder Valter Birsa and striker Zlatan Ljubijankic looked to be enough to guarantee Slovenia would reach the last 16, but it proved only the signal for a courageous fight back by the U.S. LA Galaxy star Landon Donovan pulled the first goal back in the 48th minute as he smashed his shot into the roof of the net with ferocious power. The equalizer came with nine minutes remaining as Jozy Altidore headed down for Michael Bradley -- son of coach Bob Bradley -- to convert with an equally emphatic strike. The U.S. looked to have scored the winner when Maurice Edu prodded home a Donovan free kick from the right, but referee Koman Coulibaly had already blown for a foul to the dismay of the Americans. ""I am assuming it was a foul, it couldn't have been an offside, we asked the referee many times, but he couldn't explain it,"" man of the match Donovan told AFP.","England held goalless draw Algeria in Group C clash in Cape Town .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- The death toll from flash flooding in southern France rose to 25 Thursday as rain continued to inundate the region, authorities said. Up to 20 millimeters (0.8 inches) of rain fell in some areas overnight, the Var prefecture said in a statement. Despite the additional rain, most of the flood waters have begun to recede and cleanup has begun. Some 104,000 homes were without electricity across the region, and 20,000 homes were without phone connections, the 10prefecture said. Rescue operations officially ended Thursday and authorities were focusing on the distribution of food and water,clearing debris and assisting residents of Draguignan, which was hardest hit, authorities said. The city is about 27 miles west of Cannes. Are you there? Send us your pictures or videos? Authorities warned residents not to drink water that appears or tastes unusual. They were distributing tens of thousands of bottles of water, along with meals, in the Draguignan area, the prefecture said. More local thunderstorms were forecast for Thursday afternoon and evening, the prefecture said. French President Nicolas Sarkozy was expected to visit the stricken areas next week, authorities said. The flooding, which began Tuesday, forced 2,000 people into shelters, officials said Thursday. Some 1,200 firefighters and 650 police officers have taken part in the rescue effort, the prefecture said. More than 1,400 people have been rescued by helicopter and 100 have been rescued by boat. The flooding also forced French authorities to transfer more than 400 inmates at Draguignan prison to other prisons in the south of France.

"(CNN) -- Officials in Panama City, Florida, have beaten construction delays, permit problems and the ever-present threat of hurricanes to arrive at this day: a new airport that will open the region to the world and bring in planeloads of tourism dollars. But as regular air service begins Sunday, authorities never thought they'd have to contend with a new threat: an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that continues to gush thousands of gallons of crude every day. ""We've been getting calls ever since the oil spill occurred,"" said Dan Rowe of the Panama City Visitors' Bureau. ""You know, wondering about their vacation plans."" Tourism, Rowe said, is the largest industry in Panama City. The $318-million Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport is the first international airport to open in the country since 1997. ""It is really going to be an economic driver for all of northwest Florida's economy for years to come,"" he said. The new airport is expected to generate approximately $80 million in new state revenues over the first 20 years of operation. But the challenge, now, is to convince tourists that the water is clean. ""We'll get through the oil spill,"" Rowe said. ""There's no oil on Panama City Beach or any of the beaches in northwest Florida."" Indeed, the spill is more than 100 miles away from Panama City Beach's coastline. Local officials have said that if it comes ashore, they will swiftly deal with it. Yet, beach towns across the Gulf coast have seen business slide precipitously as tar balls -- pieces of emulsified oil -- wash ashore along the coasts of Mississippi and Alabama. Florida Gov. Charlie Crist asked oil company BP, which owns the damaged well at the heart of the slick, to pay for a $35 million advertising blitz to reassure tourists that Florida beaches remain untarnished by the spill. Oil has been gushing into the Gulf at the rate of about 5,000 barrels a day (210,000 gallons) since late April, when the drill rig Deepwater Horizon blew up and sank about 40 miles off Louisiana. Some estimates have put the amount of oil spewing from the well far higher. Eleven workers are missing and presumed dead after the explosion and sinking, and the cause has not been determined. Efforts to shut down the well that was ripped open by the accident have failed so far, though BP says it has been able to capture some of the escaping oil and pump it to a ship on the surface. The company also said it will continue using a controversial subsea dispersant to break up the plume of oil, pushing back against a directive from the Environmental Protection Agency to find a less toxic alternative, the EPA indicated Saturday. The EPA issued the directive on Thursday, ordering BP to find within 24 hours a less toxic but equally effective chemical than its current product, Corexit 9500, and one that is available in sufficient quantities. The directive also gave the company 72 hours to stop applying it to the undersea gusher. Corexit has been rated more toxic and less effective than many others on the list of 18 EPA-approved dispersants, according to testimony at a congressional hearing Wednesday. The EPA released BP's response to the mandate on Saturday. The response, which BP submitted late Thursday night, said that the oil company identified the only other effective, less toxic alternative available in mass quantities as Sea Brat 4. However, BP said the Sea Brat product ""contains a small amount of a chemical that may degrade to a nonylphenol."" Nonylphenol is an organic chemical that is toxic to aquatic life and may persist in the environment for years. Corexit, however, ""does not contain chemicals that degrade into NP (and) the manufacturer indicates that Corexit reaches its maximum bio-degradability within 28 days of application"" and does not persist in the environment, BP's response said. ""Based on the information that is available today, BP continues to believe that Corexit was the best and most appropriate choice at the time when the incident occurred, and that Corexit remains the best option for subsea application,"" BP said. Also Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security announced that Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano will lead a bipartisan Senate delegation to inspect the Louisiana coastline after globs of thick, heavy oil began washing into some of the state's marshlands this week. The delegation will meet with federal officials and BP representatives to discuss the ongoing response efforts. CNN's Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.","Florida Gov.

"Vancouver, British Columbia (CNN)  -- Two members of the U.S. Olympic delegation -- both gold medalists from previous Olympics -- suffered minor injuries Sunday in an accident as they were traveling in Vice President Joe Biden's motorcade, the White House said.

"Houston, Texas (CNN) -- Stephen and Sara Stone say they never thought their six-month marriage would be tested so soon. But on April 20, a day before her husband was scheduled to come home from a three-week stint on the offshore drilling rig Deepwater Horizon, Sara Stone found herself waiting to hear whether he was dead or alive. ""My phone call was that there's been an emergency evacuation on the rig,"" she said. She went back to their home in Houston, turned on the television ""and saw that the rig was on fire."" Stephen Stone, a laborer aboard the rig, was asleep in his room after working a 12-hour shift when an explosion erupted. He was one of the 115 workers rescued from the Gulf of Mexico -- but it would be more than a day before he was allowed to call his wife. Meanwhile, she was calling hospitals and praying her husband was still alive and unhurt. ""I finally was able to get a hold of an emergency response team, and they informed me that he was on the OK list,"" she said. ""And ... where they'd been taken to, which was a hotel in Kenner, Louisiana."" The night of the blast, Deepwater Horizon marked seven years without an accident. It burned for two days before sinking, taking 11 men into the deep with it and unleashing the worst oil spill in U.S. history. BP, which owns the well; Transocean, which owned the rig; and oilfield services contractor Halliburton, which performed the cementing on the well, all blame each other for the disaster. Transocean workers have told investigators that rig managers and a BP executive argued over plans to finish up the well, which was several weeks behind schedule. And Stone told the House Judiciary Committee in May that work on the rig had to stop at least four times because of a loss of drilling fluid in the well, which indicated either an unstable or cracked formation. Stone still works for Transocean. But he's filed suit against his employer, BP, Halliburton and other companies working on the doomed rig, alleging negligence. Transocean has not responded to the claims in court, but some of the other companies have denied the allegations. Stone said he always tried to be safe on the rig, even stopping work at times to call attention to safety issues. But there were consequences, he said. At one point, he said, he was called in for a talk with ""one of the senior guys for Transocean"" aboard the rig. ""They were saying my work performance had been slipping,"" Stone said. He said he told his bosses, ""I always thought I'd try to pace myself. You know, we're out here 12 hours, so you try to pace yourself and not wear yourself out. And think about what I'm doing and work safe. ""As soon as I was done saying that, they were like, 'Well, don't use safety as a crutch.' So, you know, you kind of get mixed signals."" As a roustabout, Stone's job involved assisting crane operators and mixing the ""mud"" used as a counterweight and lubricant in the drilling process. It was a ""bottom of the barrel"" job, an entry-level position at Transocean. But he said that the drill crew was under pressure to work faster and that pressure worked its way down the chain. ""I think everybody feels it, and especially the guys lower down, because I'm sure the toolpushers and whatnot are getting plenty of pressure from the people above them,"" he said. ""But you know, we're getting pressure from everybody, pretty much, down at the bottom."" Stone was awakened by the explosion. He said he ran outside to see the barrack spaces aboard the rig ""just all fire"" and the crew scrambling for the lifeboats. ""You can't see anything like that and not expect, you know, possibly to die. So you just kind of wait for it, you know?"" he said. He watched the rig burn for eight hours, first aboard a lifeboat and then aboard a supply ship that picked up the survivors. Back in Houston, Sara Stone took the first flight to New Orleans, Louisiana. Though told her husband was safe, she still hadn't heard from Stephen. ""The main question that all of us had was, are they really on that boat? Why can't we speak to them?"" she said. Stephen Stone was finally allowed to call his wife 26 hours after the explosion and after submitting to a drug test. He showed up at the hotel a few hours later. ""It started out as the worst day of my life, and it ended up as the best,"" Sara Stone said. ""I think we probably hugged each other for as long as we could."" Stone says he doesn't think he'll return to the offshore drilling business. But he said he did manage to salvage his most important possession before the rig sank: his wedding ring. ""This amazing person decided to go get his wedding ring from his room,"" his wife said. ""I mean, he just has kind of really blown my mind as far as who he is.""","Stephen Stone was to come home from oil rig April 21 .

"San Francisco, California (CNN) -- Web sites come and go, but the short bursts of text you publish on one Web site in particular -- Twitter.com --may end up having a longer shelf life than the company itself. The Library of Congress announced this week that it will archive the billions of tweets published since Twitter launched in March 2006. Yes, that Twitter, the social networking site mocked and trash-talked in the press, late-night talk shows and by retro-minded pundits as 21st-century navel gazing for fidgeting geeks (David Letterman: ""You know what it reminds me of? Oh yeah, a waste of time."") But that's not the way the library sees it: If you use Twitter and your status updates are public, they should be in the archive. Twitter haters can go on scoffing that tweets are only ephemeral bits of frivolous information, but the Library of Congress has just ratified the importance of social media in recording history. What else does this mean? Only that future generations will have an unprecedented amount of firsthand data (in 140-character bites) about what people from every corner of the world were doing, thinking and feeling at every moment starting four years ago. There will be a record, for example, of the torrent of tweets that brought news from street demonstrations during the Iranian elections last year, when Internet and mobile lines were cut off. There will be a record of the devastation and the relief efforts out of Haiti and Chile after the earthquakes; and of a certain historic presidential inauguration.  (http://twitter.com/barackobama/status/992176676 ""We just made history. All of this happened because you gave your time, talent and passion. All of this happened because of you. Thanks"") More on the Library of Congress plan to archive tweets . Thoughts and ideas written by people who wouldn't necessarily be in a position to write them into books (some for good reason) will be immortalized just the same. Current and future academics, historians and anthropologists will have a simple but deep dataset to analyze in new ways they haven't thought of yet. The Library of Congress is the nation's oldest federal cultural institution. Its mission is to ""sustain and preserve a universal collection of knowledge and creativity for future generations."" It doesn't sound like the right place to archive messages thumbed on a cell phone or dashed off in the Web page text box of a Web site. Or as one of my own twitter followers put it: ""Since when does banality & frivolity warrant cultural preservation?"" -@matty_g http://twitter.com/matty_g/status/12187504242 . But amidst the ""craving a chocolate bar"" or ""watching my cat throw up a hairball"" tweets, there is a serious reflection of historical context -- a real-time timeline written by regular people. Even a small sampling of archived tweets yields insights. ""BREAKING: Healthcare Reform Just Passed!!!! This is one small step for health care, one giant leap for America!""http://twitter.com/Jason_Pollock/status/10852088956 . Another, when Shaun White won the Olympic gold: . ""Oh my God! Shaun White was amazing in the half pipe! Landing the double mctwist/big mac/white snake/ giant tomato! Sweet!"" http://twitter.com/Swiftsfan/status/9268595586 . And this week the White House (@whitehouse on Twitter) solicited ideas from citizens about what the United States' next major technological or scientific achievement should be. The archive of tweeted replies is intended to help prioritize the president's to-do list. Finally, three things about Twitter's dataset particularly suit it for the library's archive: . 1. A tweet is small and has a simple structure. 2. Most tweets are public. 3. Billions of public tweets are already available, and millions of new tweets go into the system every day. While Twitter itself and certain partners maintain copies of the data created with the service, the library will preserve that data regardless of what becomes of those businesses. Perhaps the most amazing thing is that the tweet archive gives many more people entrée into a collection historically reserved for a select few. Getting your words and ideas included in such an important cultural archive is a privilege. Twitter users may cringe at the thought that their tweet about the cat getting sick will outlive them like this, but they should celebrate, then make their next tweet really good. It will be around for awhile. Or as a twitter follower put it: «LC archiving tweets should remind us all that once it is in the ether, it's forever.» -@itwalkabout http://twitter.com/itwalkabout/status/12187791303 . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gina Trapani.","Library of Congress will archive all Twitter messages since site started in 2006 .
The move, Gina Trapani says, validates social media's role in recording history .

"Washington (CNN) -- Oil could turn Gulf marshlands into open water and affect millions of migratory birds for generations, Tom Moorman, the senior science official and leader of the oil spill task force for Ducks Unlimited said Friday. It has taken more than 50 years for the plant root network holding the marshlands together at the base of the Mississippi River to form, he said at a briefing for reporters. If destroyed, the marshlands would flood and become open water, he added. Louisiana marshland has shrunk from 3 million acres to 1.2 million acres, or 40 percent, since the turn of the century, and toxic oil would accelerate that, he said. He said that more than 13 million migratory birds come to the Gulf marshlands each winter, though the exact number is hard to determine. If oil enters and lingers in the Gulf marshlands through the late summer and fall, it will affect millions migratory birds that rely on marshland resources for the winter, Moorman said. ""We can't even estimate the number (of birds),"" he said. ""It's just that kind of a place."" It's difficult to to implement restoration efforts now when they don't know where the oil is going or what the impacts are right now, he said. ""In my career of 19 years I've never seen a situation with so much uncertainty,"" he said. Ryan Lambert, a fishing tour captain for Cajun Fishing Adventures, spoke at the same briefing about watching oil wash away 29 years of knowledge learned on the job. ""My books are just red with cancellations right now,"" he said. Once oil enters the wetlands, it's hard to get out so prevention is key, Moorman said. Cleanup efforts are in action in marshland areas already hit by oil, he said. For the birds, oil could kill them quickly by covering their plumage and preventing temperature control, slowly poison them through their food supply of oysters, insects and plants, or inflict ""sublethal impacts"" by causing reproduction problems when they head back north for winter, Moorman said. If necessary, Moorman said, flooding agriculture areas nearby should be considered in the hope some birds would migrate to those areas this winter. Even if they created manmade marshes, however, they can't control the birds, he said. Lambert called for sediment deposits to rebuild the marshlands so that nature could heal itself. Ducks Unlimited and its partners will know how to begin the restoration once the spill is stopped and damage can be evaluated, Moorman said.","Oil in Gulf marshlands could destroy the root system of the Louisiana marsh plants and turn the areas into open water .

"(CNN) -- If you've ever heard a corny joke, it likely was an Aggie joke. These are launched against those of us who hold Texas A&M University (aka the ""Aggies"") near and dear, usually by fans of our arch-rival, the University of Texas. Some are pretty funny, such as this one: ""Did you hear about the Aggie that drove his pickup into the lake? His dog drowned while he tried to get the tailgate down."" After today's hearing, I'm confident a new one will become popular: ""Did you hear that joke of a congressman who actually felt sorry for BP? Yea, he was that Aggie, Joe Barton."" Anyone who has read or listened to me knows that I am proud of my native Texas, and especially my alma mater, Texas A&M University. But after listening to Barton apologize this morning to BP officials for having to set aside $20 billion in an escrow fund to assist the victims of the biggest oil disaster in American history, I am ashamed that this poor excuse of an elected official has disgraced his Texas congressional district. It shouldn't matter that Barton is often representing the interests of the oil industry. Any sane person would be outraged at the response thus far of BP, as well as the insensitive and asinine comments by company representatives. In his opening statement, Barton was so over the top that even his fellow Republicans must have thought he bumped his head on his way into today's hearing. ""I'm ashamed of what happened in the White House yesterday. I think it is a tragedy of the first proportion that a private corporation can be subjected to what I would characterize as a shakedown -- in this case a $20 billion shakedown."" A shakedown? The federal government, the states of Louisiana, Florida, Alabama and Mississippi have had to amass tens of thousands of workers, and spend millions of dollars trying to do all they can to contain the oil gushing out of the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico. Businesses have shut down, fishermen are trying to figure out how they are going to feed their families in the wake of the devastation, and beaches along the Gulf Coast are closed, preventing tourists from spending dollars in the region. All of his because of the explosion on BP's oil platform 60 days ago that killed 11 people and continues to cause irreparable harm to the environment. But that means nothing to Barton, who truly is carrying the oil of the industry. You would think that a man who is always talking about government spending and fiscal conservatism would want a private company to foot the bill for an oil spill. Why should the American taxpayer have to spend our precious dollars to clean up the massive mess? When the World Trade Center's twin towers were brought down on September 11, 2001, the federal government created the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund. Nearly $7 billion was awarded, and that event wasn't the federal government's fault. It is right, fair and just that the Obama administration should force BP to fork over billions to assist those who have seen their way of life destroyed by the oil spill, and the American taxpayer, including those in Barton's district, should feel confident that BP will repay the federal government and the states every penny spent on cleaning up their mess. Any man or woman with a conscience should deplore Barton's comments, and no Republican should stand with him. Either you are on the side of BP or the American people, especially those in the Gulf. Joe, shame on you. And when I bump into you in College Station at a Texas A&M football game, I'll tell you this personally. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.","Rep. Joe Barton apologized to BP officials for ""shakedown"" by White House .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A visit to the Eiffel Tower, the Statue of Liberty and the Pyramids is on the itinerary of most jet-setting travelers. Visiting the Eiffel Tower was voted the most overrated experience by tourists. But some of the most famous and iconic tourist attractions in the world are the most disappointing to actually visit, according to a survey of British tourists. And those questioned didn't think too highly of their own country's best-known landmarks either, with Big Ben, Buckingham Palace and the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain also turning people cold. Travel expert Felice Hardy explained why many tourists, often after spending inflated amounts on reaching and then viewing the most famous places, are left with a feeling of anti-climax. ""It's easy to be swayed by brochures that opt for the mainstream and focus on clichéd tourist sights around the world,"" she said. ""But many of them are overcrowded and disappointing. ""Pick carefully and don't always go for the obvious. Natural phenomena are usually more exciting than the man-made, and can be wonderfully free of tourists."" The Eiffel Tower -- described by Hardy as ""frustratingly overcrowded and overpriced"" -- was dubbed the most disappointing international sight. Britain's biggest letdown was Stonehenge, a sacred Druid sight in the rural south of England, which was dismissed as ""an isolated pile of rocks in a usually muddy field"" by Hardy. The Diana fountain resembled ""a colorless wet skateboard park"" while as far as Big Ben was concerned: ""Once you've seen it, you'll know what time it is -- time to go somewhere else."" Three of America's most famous sights -- New York's Times Square and Statue of Liberty plus The White House in Washington also made the list of shame. But the 1,267 adults questioned by Virgin Travel Insurance also nominated the best places to visit in the world, with the Treasury in the ancient city of Petra in Jordan topping the list.

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- A U.S. federal air marshal may have violated Indian law after failing to properly secure his law enforcement equipment when inside the country, U.S. officials said Friday. The equipment brought into India included two pistol magazines and ammunition -- items the U.S. Transportation Security Administration says air marshals are supposed to secure as they enter another country. ""TSA is investigating this incident and working with Indian government officials to ensure that the facts of this incident are thoroughly reviewed,"" federal officials said in a statement issued from the TSA by the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi. Delhi police did not confirm that a U.S. air marshal was part of the investigation, but P.N. Aggarwal, the joint commissioner of Delhi police, said that ""quite a few rounds (of ammunition) and two magazines"" were discovered inside an air-conditioning duct in a hotel room. The description matched TSA's of the equipment was ""not secured properly"" by an air marshal in India. The found items led to an uncomfortable encounter for three Italians visiting India -- they were the last people to occupy the hotel room before the ammunition and magazines were found. The Italians had traveled on to Mumbai by the time the items were discovered and were called back to Delhi to talk with police. ""They were allowed to go,"" Aggarwal said, after investigators found ""no evidence"" against them. Neither Indian nor U.S. officials released the names of the Italians or the federal air marshal. Although Indian officialswould not confirm whether an air marshal was a suspect in the case, U.S. officials were more forthright. ""On June 1st, TSA was made aware of a situation regarding the failure of a Federal Air Marshal to properly secure his law enforcement equipment when entering India,"" the TSA statement said. ""The equipment included two pistol magazines and ammunition, which is consistent with duty equipment issued to Federal Air Marshals for duty carry."" ""The Federal Air Marshal Service takes such incidents seriously; agency policy requires Federal Air Marshals to adhere to international agreements to secure their law enforcement equipment when entering a foreign country.  Federal Air Marshals found to have violated these agreements are subject to the full range of disciplinary measures up to and including removal."" .

"(CNN) -- Sen. John McCain said Monday that Rep. John Lewis' controversial remarks were ""so disturbing"" that they ""stopped me in my tracks."" Sen. John McCain says comments made by Rep. John Lewis were ""unacceptable."" Lewis, a Georgia representative and veteran of the civil rights movement, on Saturday compared the feeling at recent Republican rallies to those of segregationist George Wallace. ""That's not from some, quote, party official, that's from one of the most respected people in America. It's unfair. It's unfair and it's outrageous,"" he said in an exclusive interview with CNN's Dana Bash. ""I never believed that John Lewis, who is an American hero whom I admire, would ever make a comment of that nature. He even referred to the bombing of a church in Birmingham. That's unacceptable,"" he said.  Watch McCain's reaction » . Lewis on Saturday said in a statement that McCain and Gov. Sarah Palin ""are sowing the seeds of hatred and division."" ""During another period, in the not too distant past, there was a governor of the state of Alabama named George Wallace who also became a presidential candidate. George Wallace never threw a bomb. He never fired a gun, but he created the climate and the conditions that encouraged vicious attacks against innocent Americans who were simply trying to exercise their constitutional rights. Because of this atmosphere of hate, four little girls were killed on Sunday morning when a church was bombed in Birmingham, Alabama,"" wrote the Democrat. He later said a ""careful review"" of his comments ""would reveal that I did not compare Sen. John McCain or Gov. Sarah Palin to George Wallace."" A McCain aide described the moment that the campaign saw Lewis' comment as an emotional one and a reality check as to ""what the campaign is up against."" The aide said they all stopped, delayed McCain's flight and got on a conference call to try to figure out how to respond. McCain said Saturday that Lewis' earlier statement was ""a brazen and baseless attack"" and called on Sen. Barack Obama to repudiate it. McCain on Monday again criticized Obama for not condemning Lewis' words. The Obama campaign said that Obama ""does not believe that John McCain or any policy criticism is in any way comparable to George Wallace or his segregationist policies"" but said Lewis was ""right to condemn some of the hateful rhetoric."" McCain told CNN that Lewis' status as a respected politician makes his remarks even more unacceptable. ""I say when anybody says anything like that that is so beyond the pale, that it stuns me, because that's not what America and this debate should be all about,"" he said. ""I will reject that kind of language, and again, I'm so disappointed in Congressman John Lewis."" Some McCain supporters have yelled ""treason,"" ""kill him"" and ""terrorist"" at recent campaign events. Asked about the anger at his rallies -- something that has increased since the McCain campaign started highlighting Obama's ties to 1960s radical Bill Ayers, McCain said he was insulted by some characterizations of his supporters. ""There is always the fringe element that's in politics in America. The overwhelming majority of the people that come to my rallies are good and decent and patriotic Americans,"" the Republican presidential candidate said. ""For anybody to intimate that the overwhelming ... 99 percent is anything but patriotic and good Americans is frankly unacceptable, and I won't stand for it."" Obama has publicly acknowledged McCain's efforts to get his supporters to show respect. McCain said Monday that despite trailing Obama in the polls, he's comfortable with where he and his running mate are. According to CNN's latest poll of polls, Obama is up by 8 percentage points, 50-42. CNN's national poll of polls consists of six surveys: ABC/Washington Post (October 8-11), Fox News/Opinion Dynamics (October 8-9), Newsweek (October 8-9), Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby (October 10-12), Gallup (October 10-12) and Diageo/Hotline (October 10-12). It does not have a sampling error. ""We're going to be just fine. I have been written off on so many occasions by political pundits that it's hard for me to count,"" McCain said, joking that his campaign has ""more lives than a cat."" ""But the point is -- we're doing fine. I'm happy where we're at, we're fighting the good fight. That's what it's all about.""","In exclusive talk with CNN, McCain says he is ""so disappointed"" in Rep. John Lewis .

"Osh, Uzbekistan (CNN) -- The acting president of Kyrgyzstan said when it comes to the recent ethnic clashes in her country, she would multiply the official death toll by 10, according to the Russian news website Kommersant. Roza Otunbayeva told Kommersant that many deaths in the countryside were not part of the official total of yet, which the Kyrgyz news agency Kabar places at 191, according to the Kyrgyz Health Care Ministry. In a separate interview in the southern Kyrgyz city of Osh, the interim president called for reconciliation between the Kyrgyz and Uzbeks. ""By all means, we have to give hope that we shall restore the city, return all the refugees and create all conditions for that. I think the entire world will be helping us, because we two peoples have the goodwill to live in peace and friendship together,"" Otunbayeva said. A U.S. official on Friday called for a ""substantial"" investigation into the killings. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Blake was at a refugee camp near the border in Uzbekistan, where thousands of ethnic Uzbeks fled violence in neighboring Kyrgyzstan. Blake said he wants Kyrgyzstan authorities to investigate who carried out the attacks on ethnic Uzbeks and to bring those responsible to justice. He planned to go to the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek later Friday to deliver the message personally, he said. Blake praised the Uzbek government for working to support the refugees who have flooded into their country. About 120,000 have crossed the border into Uzbekistan, far more than officials had been expecting. The Obama administration is committed to assisting the Uzbek government with supplies and other aid, Blake said at the camp near Yor Kishlok, where refugees were living in rows of tents. While countries and nongovernmental organizations are sending aid to the region, Otunbayeva's assistant, Azimbek  Beknazarov, said in a news release Friday morning that if England doesn't extradite Maksim Bakiev, the son of deposed Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiev, then the Kyrgyz government will consider ""closing the Manas airbase."" However, the interim government representative, Temir Sariev, told CNN that, ""This is only Mr. Beknazarov's opinion and, so far, the interim government is not sharing this opinion."" In a statement released by London-based attorneys, Maksim Bakiev said, ""I have been forced into exile in fear for my life. The interim government in Kyrgyzstan accuses me of new crimes every day. The charges are bogus, to divert attention from their own crimes. They accuse me before there has been any opportunity for an investigation. Clearly they seek to try to make me a scapegoat for the chaos in the country. I view events in my homeland with horror and pray for an end to the violence."" Refugees were telling stories about the violence that began last week, describing houses and businesses burned by rampaging militias, bodies in the streets and how their relatives had been killed. Video and witness accounts were starting to emerge Friday that units of the Kyrgyz military may have been taking part in the violence. Refugees on both sides of the border said they are frightened by the Kyrgyz military. Ethnic violence has displaced about 300,000 people inside Kyrgyzstan, The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Thursday, citing information from the Kyrgyz interim government and nongovernmental organizations. Some relief for those refugees is imminent. The UN refugee agency said Friday it will begin airlifting supplies into Kyrgyzstan this weekend. UNHCR plans to send two cargo planes to Osh with enough assistance to help about 15,000 people, with one arriving Saturday and the other Sunday. Families and host communities were sheltering many of them, but at least 40,000 people were in need of shelter, according to the UNHCR. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced a ""flash appeal"" for $71 million, seeking immediate funding for food, shelter, medical supplies and other emergency aid as part of the response to the crisis. The violence between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks in southern Kyrgyzstan has calmed down after it erupted late last week. The UNHCR said in addition to the dozens of deaths, around 1,900 have been wounded. The agency said the situation in Osh and nearby villages ""appears to be volatile,"" and conditions in Jalal-Abad are tense. Many families have left Osh and Jalal-Abad for Bishkek and other areas. The flood of refugees into Uzbekistan has strained the country's health care and food sectors, and several dozen female refugees crossed the border pregnant and have given birth, the United Nations said. China, which borders Kyrgyzstan on the east, said Thursday it had removed 1,299 Chinese nationals, the state-run news agency Xinhua said. The clashes in Kyrgyzstan, which started last week, were part of the most serious outbreak of ethnic violence in the former Soviet republic since 1990, when hundreds of people died in skirmishes between Uzbeks and Kyrgyz in Osh. The United Nations and several countries, including the United States, Germany and Russia, have sent aid to the region. Francois Blancy, deputy head of the Red Cross regional office in Uzbekistan, said more aid is needed. ""We are now at the peak of the humanitarian crisis,"" Blancy said Thursday.

"(CNN) -- Ireland has expelled an Israeli diplomat over the use of forged passports in the assassination of a Hamas arms dealer in Dubai, allegedly by Israeli agents, the Irish foreign minister announced Tuesday. Ireland is following in the footsteps of the United Kingdom and Australia, which each kicked out Israeli diplomats after concluding Israel had probably forged their countrys' passports as part of a Mossad operation against Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, a founding member of Hamas' military wing. Ireland had not been able to link Israel conclusively to the forgery, Foreign Minister Micheal Martin said Tuesday. But ""the fact that the forged Irish passports were used by members of the same group who carried the forged British and Australian passports, leads us to the inescapable conclusion that an Israeli government agency was responsible for the misuse and, most likely, the manufacture of the forged Irish passports associated with the murder of Mr. Mabhouh,"" he said. Israel's Foreign Ministry said it ""regrets the decision of the Irish government, which is not in line with the importance of our relationship."" Israel maintains there is no proof linking it to the doctored passports or the killing of Al-Mabhouh. Al-Mabhouh was found dead in his hotel room in Dubai in January. Police believe he was killed the night before and suspect the Mossad, the secretive Israeli foreign intelligence unit, was behind his killing. Israel has a stated policy on security matters of neither confirming nor denying involvement.","Dublin suspects Israel forged Irish passports .

"(CNN) -- These past six weeks, we've been thinking a lot about the ocean. But there's a deeper story than this one oil spill. Unfortunately the Deepwater Horizon disaster is a pretty typical example of the way we think about the ocean: We just don't worry about stuff that happens out there. The ocean covers 71 percent of the Earth's surface, and we hardly know anything about it. We humans are creating big problems because of what we don't know. We take fish from the ocean to eat without really knowing where they came from, or what they eat, or how many of them there are, or if we're maybe taking the last one. We dump whatever we like in the ocean and watch it float away -- to where? Who cares? The ocean is a massive, unexplored area of our planet, and in the U.S., we spend less on getting to know it than we spend on getting to know outer space. And our lack of attention is showing. Ocean fish are shrinking in size from year to year; coral reefs are being scraped away, and glorious ocean habitats are dying. But because it happens in the blank blue part of the globe, we don't hear about it or if we do, we don't pay attention. Watch the story of a woman who rowed the Pacific . So how can we get your attention on the ocean -- so we can start solving these problems we're creating? In April, we went on a trip to the Galápagos with 100 ocean scientists, activists and artists, filmmakers and musicians, to talk about what's going on in the ocean and what we can do to help. On the Mission Blue Voyage, we heard things and saw things that shocked us -- like Brian Skerry's picture of shrimp bycatch, the 8 pounds of dead sea creatures that are thrown away as garbage in order to catch 10 ounces of shrimp. Watch Skerry's talk about the glory and shame of the oceans . And we saw Jeremy Jackson describe a nearly lifeless ocean taken over by jellyfish. We also saw amazing things, thing that blew our minds -- like watching a bioluminescent jellyfish light up its mating display in the pitch-black deep ocean. We talked with some of the smartest people we've ever met, and we came up with some big plans for saving the ocean. But we came home from the trip still wondering -- will it make a difference? We're not scientists, but we know something we can do: encourage you to talk and think about the ocean, with hope that you will be more involved in the things that will make a difference. It's hard to think about having a role in saving something so overwhelmingly immense. But you can be a part of making things better. In fact, all of us have to. Here are some great places to start: . • Write a letter to your elected representative. Handwrite it; it makes a difference if you do. Let them know you support increased funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The more we learn about the ocean, the better we can protect it. If you live in Hawaii, thank your legislator for being part of the ban on sharkfin soup; if you live outside Hawaii, ask your state or county representatives why it hasn't been banned yet where you live. • If you're on Facebook, join the Mission Blue page or if you're on Twitter, follow @MissionBlue to keep up with ocean news. • Get one of those little responsible seafood guides, and use it.

"(CNN) -- In 1947, when AT&T was America's only phone company, a woman called the company's chief operator to protest a long-distance charge on her bill. She proved her house had been shuttered when the call was made, but the operator refused to reverse the charge. ""This isn't the end of this, you know,"" she said. The operator replied, ""And where will you go?"" This week on the Gulf Coast, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, lashing out at BP's failure to stop ""the biggest oil spill in human history,"" threatened that BP had better produce or ""We'll push them out."" The unspoken reply was, ""And where will you go?"" It wasn't BP that contradicted Salazar, but, ironically, Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Thad Allen, who said, ""The private sector owns nearly all the means to deal with this problem and [to] fix the leak."" Big Government: Meet Even-Bigger Business. The far right likes to invoke Big Government like a bogeyman, a ghost to frighten the uninformed. But when they need Big Government they decry its absence. Bobby Jindal was trying to privatize much of Louisiana's government services. Had his approach been applied nationwide, the Federal government wouldn't have the resources he's demanding it use to save Louisiana's coast. Can government get big and bloated? Of course. But there's a difference between starvation and a diet. What the right fails to acknowledge is that big business, by its nature, is a bully. And you don't stop a bully by turning yourself into a 90 pound weakling. In fact, you may have to gain weight. Regardless, you have to exercise, changing pork to muscle. It's going to take lots of muscle to truly hold BP responsible for the massive impact of its failure. President Obama has already deployed 1,105 vessels to contain the spill, but this massive flotilla is not a match for the estimated 798,000 gallons of oil spewing daily into the Gulf of Mexico. Residents of Louisiana and the Gulf Coast are understandably frustrated, but they, and all of us, need to remember who made the mess, and why. Obama's Interior Department released a report that uncovered ""a culture of cronyism"" between federal regulators and oil and gas executives, a ""culture"" that dates, unsurprisingly, to the Bush administration. Now let's be clear: This is BP's fault, not Bush's, no matter how complicit in the neglect. Rand Paul, expressing the Right's ""business before people"" philosophy, dismissed the preventable disaster as a case of ""accidents happen."" Well, unregulated big business is no accident, though it is a disaster. We know BP failed to follow federal mandates, environmental guidelines, engineering best practices and common sense. Now the Times-Picayune reports that hours before the explosion, BP sent home a team of experts hired to test the well's cement lining -- without letting them perform the test that would have detected the problem. That is no accident. That's what we in Cajun country call greed and arrogance. BP's defiance of an EPA order to cease spraying a toxic dispersent and its attempt to buy out Gulf fishermen for $5,000, is not only offensive, it's downright criminal. The truth is, this is a huge mess, an environmental and personal disaster with no easy answers. Will the ""sand islands"" sop up the oil? Maybe, but at what cost elsewhere? How long before the seafood and wildlife nurseries recover? Who knows? Seventeen years after Exxon Valdez, Alaska's herring still aren't back, and that spill was a fraction of the size. What will be the impact on the lives and lifestyle of the Gulf fishers, and those whose livelihoods depend on them? Guess, and guess again. Will the flood of oil erode the marshes and wetlands so far that the next hurricane makes landfall in Indianapolis? Next time you hear the Big Government vs. Bigger Business stereotype, remember who's cleaning up after whom. An Obama House Cleaning is ahead. And the bullies will be punished -- not just fines, but jail time is in order. President Obama needs to do more than clean the regulatory house and discipline Big Oil. He needs to institute preventive and compensatory measures: Prioritize the wetland and levee repair that should have come after Katrina; expedite the oil and gas revenue sharing -- Louisiana can't wait seven years; help the victims regain their livelihood. Give us daily briefings, President Obama, of what's been done, what executive orders have been issued and what legislation is being passed. In short, make sure Big Government is big enough to keep Bigger Business in check. Or who knows what price we'll pay.

"(CNN) -- The biological mother of a missing 7-year-old Oregon boy has written an open letter to her son saying, ""I am sorry that I was not there to protect you."" ""I am so soooooo sorry that this has happened,"" Desiree Young wrote to Kyron Horman in a letter that was released Monday to NBC News. ""I will never be able to forgive myself for being so many hours away when you needed me the most. I pray that you come back to me because I am afraid that I can't live without you."" The letter comes more than two weeks after the boy disappeared on June 4.

Cell phone records indicate she may not have been at the school at that time, according to a report in People Magazine. Authorities refused to comment on the report. In the emotional letter, Young speaks directly to her young son. ""When you come home I will show you all of [the] things that everyone did for you, just to find you,"" she wrote.

"(CNN) -- Jose Mourinho revealed that he will take time to learn about Real Madrid before deciding to make any major changes, as he was unveiled as the Spanish club's new coach on Monday. The 47-year-old has signed a four-year contract just two weeks after leading Inter Milan to success in the European Champions League final, sealing an unprecedented treble for the Italian club in his second season at the San Siro. Real paid a reported $10 million compensation to Inter to secure his services after ending Chilean coach Manuel Pellegrini's only season in charge, which ended without a trophy despite a massive spending spree on the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Kaka. Mourinho, who spoke in Spanish, English and his native Portuguese to the assembled media throng, said it was too early to predict wholesale changes to the star-studded squad. ""I believe it's time to analyze the situation, to get to know my club, ask lots of questions and get answers,"" he said. ""I need to realize the direction of my work. The most important thing is not the coach or the players but the club. We are too small compared to the dimension of the club. ""If we work as a group, it's not difficult to get results. I want this group to have an identity, to win everything. The strength of my team is always the team and not the individuals. ""The club is happy with the roster of last season and so am I. We don't need major changes. ""We need three or four players for the coach to have more possibilities to get closer to my ideal of a team. But I don't think it's going to be a summer with a lot of changes. I think it will be a more calm summer with all the focus on the World Cup."" Mourinho said he was confident of a successful relationship with compatriot Ronaldo, the world's most expensive player following his $130 million transfer from Manchester United in July. ""Cristiano Ronaldo is an incredible player not only for Real but for the whole of football. Cristiano is a winner and it's not difficult to persuade him of this,"" he said. ""I don't know if I was born to coach Real Madrid, but I was born to be a football coach. I love important challenges. ""I am Jose Mourinho and I don't change. I arrive with all my qualities and my defects. My attraction to Real Madrid is due to its history, its frustrations in recent years and its expectations to win. ""It's a unique club and I believe that not to coach Real leaves a void in a coach's career."" Mourinho, who has now twice won Europe's premier club competition, said he was confident of completing his tenure at the Santiago Bernabeu, where 10 managers have departed in the past 10 seasons. ""I think a coach needs to be ready to be sacked. But if a coach fears that, he doesn't work well and has great problems,"" he said. ""I am a coach that has a lot of self-esteem and confidence, and I don't think about the possibility of being sacked. I think four years of contract is enough to win, to build a strong team for the present and the future. ""The sacking of Pellegrini doesn't make me happy. I am never happy when a coach is sacked. But football is like that.

"Islamabad, Pakistan -- Gary Faulkner, the Colorado man arrested in Pakistan while hunting for Osama bin Laden, has been moved to Islamabad by the Pakistani government, his brother said Wednesday. Dr. Scott Faulkner said Jim Flowers from the U.S. consulate in Peshawar, Pakistan, told him the Pakistani government is still questioning Gary Faulkner and that he has not been charged with anything. Gary Faulkner, 50, was stopped near the border with Afghanistan's Nuristan province, Pakistani police announced Tuesday. He was carrying a pistol, a sword, night-vision equipment and Christian religious books, said Mumtaz Ahmed, a police chief in the area. Faulkner told police that he had been looking for bin Laden since al Qaeda's September 11, 2001, and had traveled to the area several times before, Ahmed said. Faulkner said he had no intention of killing bin Laden, but because of the weapons he was carrying, police did not believe him, Ahmed said. Faulkner underwent a medical exam Wednesday. A Pakistani doctor determined that he has psychological problems and has been undergoing dialysis every 20 days, said a senior Pakistani intelligence official, who is not identified because he is not authorized to speak to the media. A U.S. Embassy spokesman said Embassy personnel still have not had access to Gary Faulkner and were not aware of the doctor's examination. Faulkner's brother, Dr. Scott Faulkner, said Tuesday that Gary Faulkner does not have mental problems. ""He doesn't meet any of the DSM -- that's the psychiatric manual -- he doesn't meet any criteria for psychosis. He is not schizophrenic. He doesn't have schizophrenia. He doesn't hear voices. God isn't telling him, 'Oh, Gary, go get him, go get him.' He's a normal person. He handles himself in society,"" Scott Faulkner said. ""My brother is not crazy. He is highly intelligent and loves his country and he has not forgotten what Osama has done to this country,"" Scott Faulkner said. A reward of up to $25 million is being offered by the U.S. State Department in return for information leading directly to bin Laden's arrest. Gary Faulkner is a California-born independent contractor who has lived in Colorado since 1968, his brother said. Colorado Bureau of Investigation records show that a Gary Faulkner has a lengthy criminal record of minor offenses that dates to the early 1980s. He served jail time on three separate occasions for various charges that included second-degree burglary, and was arrested as recently as 2006 for a traffic violation. More recently, Scott Faulkner said, his brother felt the U.S. government was not doing enough to bring bin Laden to justice, ""and he felt that he was, as a Christian, not afraid -- that he could boldly step out and that doors would be opened for him."" ""And I agree with him,"" Scott Faulkner said. ""The fact that he's been over there six times and has not received a scratch tells me that somebody's looking after him."" Scott Faulkner said his brother ""could blend in with the local population and go places that our military cannot go."" ""We have relationships with the Pakistani government: 'OK. You can go in this region or you can't go in that region,' whereas my brother could go about willy-nilly,"" he said. ""He had a long beard. He looked like Taliban. When he . wore his robe, he looked like Taliban. The only way you could tell he was not was when he spoke."" In Washington, Tuesday, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said the Pakistanis informed the U.S. government about the arrest, but he couldn't discuss details. ""We want to talk to him, figure out who he is, what brought him to Pakistan, and we'll take it from there,"" Crowley said.

"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- The suspected head of an Italian mafia murder squad eluded police for a third time, and may have escaped through the sewer pipes, according to Italian media reports. Italian police examine a sewer that may have offered an escape route for a suspected mafia boss. Giuseppe Setola, 38, is believed to have slipped into a tunnel built under his hideout near Naples, Italy on Monday, as police closed in on him, according to Italy's state-run ANSA news agency and reports in the La Repubblica and Corriere Della Sera newspapers. That tunnel connects to the sewer system in the nearby town of Caserta, north of Naples. Corriere published photos of anti-mafia police searching through what was described as Setola's trash-strewn bunker and the tunnel. Anti-mafia police have been searching for Setola for months, and have already arrested his wife and two suspected members of his crew, according to the reports. Monday was the third time he avoided arrest. Setola is allegedly the head of a killing team run by the powerful Casalesi clan which belongs to the Neapolitan mafia known as Camorra. He got out of jail last spring after a doctor ruled that he was legally blind. Prosecutors have opened an investigation into that ruling. The Casalesi clan is featured in the best-selling book ""Gomorrah"" -- a play on the word ""Camorra"" -- written by Roberto Saviano who now lives under constant police protection. Saviano recently said he may have to leave Italy to escape constant death threats from the mafia and its supporters. Police began cracking down on Setola and his colleagues after the murder of six West African immigrants in the nearby town of Castel Volturno in September. After those killings, the Italian government activated the army to help bolster efforts against the Casalesi clan, which is believed to have killed more than 20 people since May. The two suspected members of his squad have given police information about his movements. In November, police arrested an Italian police officer suspected of informing Setola about police operations.","Italian mafia suspect may have escaped through the sewer pipes, reports say.

"Osh, Kyrgyzstan (CNN) -- Life in this embattled country's second-largest city appeared calm Tuesday even as concerns over the plight of refugees grew. The calm came as the Central Asian nation's news agency AKI Press reported that the death toll had risen to 176, a number that some observers discounted as low. A team of Red Cross doctors who visited Jalalabad's main hospital estimated the death toll at ""several hundred."" The streets of the southern city of Osh appeared deserted, except for a few pedestrians and army checkpoints. Stores, warehouses and shops were burned along miles of streets, which were patrolled armed police and soldiers. Near the airport, the most dangerous part of town, no one could be seen on the streets, which were quiet except for the sounds of sporadic gunfire. In Jalalabad, about an hour away, journalist Dalton Bennett accompanied Kyrgyz military through the streets Tuesday evening and told CNN that the military appeared to have imposed total control in the downtown area. Explainer: Kyrgyzstan's ethnic unrest . But, in the outskirts of town, sporadic gunfire and impromptu ""checkpoints"" continued, he said. About two-thirds of the downtown area had been looted and/or burned, with Uzbek-owned buildings appearing to have been the primary targets, he said. Buildings marked ""Kyrgyz"" appeared undamaged, he said. In recent days, more than 100,000 ethnic Uzbeks have fled the clashes with ethnic Kyrgyz, streaming into camps in neighboring Uzbekistan, according to Uzbekistan's Foreign Ministry. Thousands more have been denied passage into Uzbekistan because of a lack of resources. Many were standing on the Kyrgyz side of a barbed-wire fence. Three border crossings between Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan were open, Uzbekistan's Foreign Ministry said. One, at Yor Kishlok, Uzbekistan, remained closed. The closure came after throngs of people fleeing the violence overwhelmed refugee camps in Uzbekistan. Working together, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent Society of Kyrgyzstan have helped 16 medical facilities caring for more than 1,130 injured people in the past week, the ICRC said in a statement. Police said 15 officers have been killed. The United States and Germany have evacuated 89 people -- including 31 Americans and 40 Europeans -- from Osh, the German Foreign Ministry said Tuesday. They were taken to the capital, Bishkek, in the north. The United States is providing humanitarian assistance to the impoverished country and evaluating what further help may be needed, including military, a senior U.S. health official said in Washington. ""Right now our focus is humanitarian but it remains to be seen exactly what, if any, security assistance Kyrgystan needs,"" said the official, who spoke on background because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue. The official said the United States is not considering acting alone to provide any security assistance. The U.S. military said the interim Kyrgyz government has presented an official request for aid from the U.S. government beyond the $800,000 in humanitarian assistance already provided. U.S. officials were working with the provisional government to determine how best to distribute another $200,000 in medical and emergency supplies. The clashes are part of the most serious outbreak of ethnic violence in the former Soviet republic since 1990, when hundreds of people died in skirmishes between Uzbeks and Kyrgyz in Osh. It was not clear what sparked the violence, which came weeks after bloody protests removed Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiev from office. But it was clear that Tuesday's calm did not indicate an end to the crisis. ""This is far from over,"" said Anna Nelson, a spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross, in a telephone call with CNN from Geneva, Switzerland. ""It's still extremely volatile. The needs are still extremely great."" Those Uzbeks who are most vulnerable are those who have had to remain in Kyrgyzstan, many of whom include orphans and the elderly, she said. For some, the situation is dire. ""Orphanages are running out of food,"" she said. Mosques and hospitals in Jalalabad are receiving large numbers of burn victims and people with gunshot wounds, she said. On Uzbekistan's side of the border, refugees were seeking shelter in parking lots and abandoned buildings, the ICRC said. As demand for water outpaced supply, some refugees were drinking from irrigation ditches, raising concern about outbreaks of diarrhea. Some analysts have said the clashes stem from resentment from minority Uzbeks that they have been under-represented in government positions and fears from ethnic Kyrgyz that Uzbeks in the country will help Uzbekistan invade Kyrgyzstan. Refugees were seeking help at bleak camps on the Kyrgyz border with Uzbekistan. ""People are screaming, 'We need food; we need food,' to those who are passing by,"" EU Commissioner Kristalina Georgieva said. But in the refugee camp in Yor Kishlock, there were ample supplies of food, tents, beds, sheets and blankets. The vast majority of the camp's occupants were female. They said the males had largely stayed behind to look after their homes. The United Nations said it was sending an emergency team to Uzbekistan to aid refugees who had crossed the border. U.N. Security Council President Claude Heller said the group condemns the ""continued acts of violence in the Kyrgyz Republic and notes the need to support the delivery of humanitarian assistance."" He said the council was assessing the situation in Kyrgyzstan and called for ""calm and a return to the rule of law"" in the country. In Osh, that calm did come Tuesday. But some wondered how long it would last. ""A pause before the unknown, and it's not clear if dark or light is ahead,"" said relief worker Will Lynch said. CNN's Matthew Chance, Brian Walker, Jill Dougherty and Nic Robertson contributed to this report.","NEW: Death toll at 176, Kyrgyz news agency reports; Red Cross estimate is higher .

"Washington (CNN) -- A conservative magazine suggests Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan is ""hostile"" to gun owners, based on notes she wrote in the Clinton White House in 1996. The notes were released last week by the William J. Clinton Presidential Library. Kagan worked in the White House Counsel's office in 1995 and 1996. Kagan, 50, was nominated to the high court May 10 by President Obama, and her confirmation hearings begin June 28. The disclosure coincided with the release Friday afternoon of about 80,000 more documents. A March 1996 document is likely to stir conservative anger. In it, she labeled the Ku Klux Klan and the National Rifle Association as ""bad guy"" organizations. The issue was a pending bill, the Volunteer Protection Act, which gave some volunteer workers from a range of nonprofits a measure of liability protection from lawsuits. Kagan expressed concern that certain groups might be included in a ""Cumulative List"" of tax-exempt groups that would be covered under the proposed law. Kagan addressed her handwritten thoughts, based on a conversation with Clinton aide Fran Allegra, who responded that day that neither the KKK nor the NRA was on the list provided by the Internal Revenue Service. Allegra gently advised his colleague, ""We probably need to be careful about suggesting 'bad' organizations will qualify for the provision bill as it would suggest we are allowing 'bad' organizations to qualify for tax-exempt status."" The measure was passed into law in 1997, but ultimately vetoed by Congress. Allegra is now a federal judge. The National Review first reported about the notes, and asked on its website, ""Is Kagan so hostile to gun rights that she would compare the top gun-rights organization in the United States with  a viciously racist hate group?"" The White House issued a response Friday. ""Kagan's notes from a conversation with DOJ Attorney Fran Allegra track an earlier memo Allegra sent to her outlining which organizations would be shielded under volunteer and nonprofit liability legislation,"" said White House spokesman Ben LaBolt. ""Allegra's memo notes that neither the KKK nor the NRA would be shielded from liability under the bill, after Democrats in Congress and others raised concerns that the provision swept too broadly. It's simply not credible to suggest that these jotted down notes represent anything but preliminary research on legal questions about what organizations would be covered under the legislation, and the organizations discussed reflect the public debate over the legislation at that time."" The guns rights group also reacted to the Kagan notes Friday. ""How can the NRA respond to something that bizarre and outrageous?"" NRA's Director of Public Affairs Andrew Arulanandam said in an interview with CNN. ""This is precisely the kind of stuff that needs to be aired out in the confirmation hearings, a complete airing out of where she stands on our issues."" Some 160,000 pages of documents are being reviewed from Kagan's four years in the Clinton White House, during which, in addition to being in the counsel's office, she also served as an adviser on the Domestic Policy Council from 1997 to 1999. Papers from those stints have been released the past two Fridays, revealing a lawyer with a politically tuned, pragmatic approach to issues like abortion, gun control and tobacco regulation. The material is a prelude to Kagan's much-anticipated appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Republicans on the panel continue to express deep concern that the weekly document releases provide little time for members to explore her work as a government lawyer, and whether they offer any clues about how she might rule as a justice on the nation's highest court. ""We must be convinced that someone who has spent the better part of her career as a political advisor, policy advocate, and academic -- rather than as a legal practitioner or a judge -- can put aside her personal and political beliefs, and impartially apply the law, rather than be a rubberstamp for the Obama or any other Administration,"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, said in a floor speech Friday. ""The Clinton library documents make it harder -- not easier -- to believe that Ms. Kagan could make that necessary transition."" The White House has fashioned a low-key campaign to get Kagan confirmed, trying to avoid any public controversy that could derail her elevation to a lifetime job on the bench. The Clinton-era documents have been released on Friday afternoons, and Fridays generally are slow news days. Obama officials have refused to make Kagan available for interviews since her nomination, and she has spent her days meeting privately with senators and prepping for the hearings in a small office in the White House complex. If confirmed, Kagan would succeed retiring Justice John Paul Stevens. Before stepping down from daily involvement, she was the administration's solicitor general, and personally argued six cases before the Supreme Court. She has no judicial experience, and conservative critics have been eagerly scanning Kagan's record in government service and academia for signs of her possible judicial philosophy.","NEW: White house rejects criticism, calls notes ""preliminary research on legal questions""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Richard Serra stands in the Museum of Modern Art's Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden, his hair as white as the marble floor. The summer sun of New York radiates from the towering metal of his monumental works. He breaks no sweat. He likes how the weeping beeches and birches have leafed out since April when two of his enormous steel sculptures were installed. A crane lifted the tonnage over the garden wall from West 54th Street. This new foliage, he notes, shades his works' rising, rusting arcs with an air of mystery. ""You can't see 'Ellipse' from 'Intersection.' So as you walk out of one, you're not thinking about the other."" What you're thinking about may be their size. ""Intersection II"" is more than 13 feet tall and 51 feet long. ""Torqued Ellipse IV"" at one point is 32 feet across. Made to be entered, explored, felt in terms of how they divide and define space around you, these gentle, giant landmarks of a 40-year career place Serra today at the very heart of the Museum of Modern Art's mission and capabilities.  Watch videos in which Serra describes the MoMA retrospective and walks you through several of his sculptures » . For a long moment, Serra takes in his own work. These are bafflingly graceful walls of 2-inch-thick steel, mottled and rough. This engaging, articulate man knows how to bend and balance the plates so gorgeously hunkered down in a place usually ruled by far smaller works of Picasso, Giacometti, Rodin, Alexander Calder and Henry Moore. Serra smiles. ""You know what? When they take my work back out of here, this place is going to look like a peewee golf course."" That won't happen until September. Until then, MoMA's new exhibition, ""Richard Serra Sculpture: Forty Years,"" reveals that sense of humor along with the sophisticated spatial concepts the Californian explains as he leads you, glad for your interest, across a terrain all his.  See a gallery of images for perspective on the geometric line, shape and volume of Serra's work » . Born in San Francisco in 1939, educated at Yale, a former painter whose study of art and tradition in Europe left him searching for more dimensions, Serra today is one of the most widely applauded sculptors alive. Internationally acclaimed for his distinctive ground-cleaving site-specific works in landscape, he's as generous in talking about his art as he is assured in commanding the foundries and steel riggers who render it. No guarded maestro, hiding methods and intentions, Serra is ready with virtuosic metaphor when given a chance to explain the torus of ""Torqued Torus Inversion,"" gesturing, pointing, doubling back to be sure you follow. ""Think of a bicycle rim, and where the tube is in that rim ... the word means doughnut in mathematical language."" For all the grainy computation of geometric and gravitational considerations required to set hundreds of tons at precise tilts over the heads of the thousands moving through MoMA each day, Serra clearly is still seized by the wonder of his own creations. ""The space is almost palpable,"" he says, standing at the center of one of the two parts of ""Torqued Torus Inversion."" ""The steel,"" he says, ""is just a wrapping skin that compresses the space."" Suddenly, you understand what he's doing. ""The subject matter"" of this work, he tells you, ""is your personal experience of walking into and through and around. There really isn't any content until you fulfill your exploration"" of a piece. When Yoshio Taniguchi designed MoMA's soaring new $890 million building between Fifth and Sixth Avenues for its opening in November 2004, this exhibition was already in the works. Read commentary on the Taniguchi building in Manhattan . Kirk Varnedoe, the museum's late chief curator of painting and sculpture, had arranged for the structure to be built with a huge H-shaped exhibition space off the central atrium. The room's floors were reinforced to handle heavy pieces, and a 40-foot section of wall was made to be ripped out as a doorway. This was all done with the express idea of putting capacious new Serra works on view. Senior Deputy Director of Exhibitions Jennifer Russell says Serra used the size constraints of that breakaway wall in determining the height of the new pieces.  Watch an audio slide show in which Sr. Dep. Director of Exhibitions Jennifer Russell talks about installing the Serra show » . So the retrospective not only brings into major focus the place of this key U.S. figure in the world's conversation on modern art, but it also makes good on what MoMA Director Glenn Lowry likes to call presenting art ""full-force."" Read more about Lowry's perspective on American art museums. The museum's array of its power to produce and present abstract work in an accessible, meaningful way is based in the three-stage character of this expansive exhibition. Visitors may understand these three new works as something akin to steel mazes. Some report the sensation of a tilting floor as they walk through the warm-sienna walls of ""Sequence."" They duck into and out of ""Torqued Torus Inversion"" through the narrow openings in that pair of great tortellini of heavy metal. And they follow the ribbon of looming steel that snakes its way across the northern end of the hangar-like room. The walls of ""Band"" form canyons and cul-de-sacs that seem much too simple to create the disorientation they do in a viewer. Serra says that ""Band,"" more than 71 feet long, is likeliest to spur his next work. And in following its serpentine footprint, he comes out with what might serve as an essential Serra-ism: ""You have the idea that you're either in the outside of the space you've just been in, or you're in the inside of the a new space that's on the outside of the space you've been in."" When you walk the piece, you understand what he just said. And you've interacted with a space the sculptor concedes mystifies even him. ""I still don't completely understand my relationship to the horizontal field as you walk this piece. ... It's still unknowable to me, so there are potentials in this piece that I haven't explored yet."" In the 1960s, Serra formed Low Rate Movers, a furniture-moving outfit in Lower Manhattan, along with composers Philip Glass and Steve Reich, artist Chuck Close, the late actor Spalding Gray and independent filmmaker Michael Snow. Working only from 23rd Street southward and just a couple of days a week each, he says, members of the group could support their explorative art careers. ""After a while, though,"" he says, ""we stopped moving pianos and refrigerators. Too heavy."" That sounds funny coming from a man who's standing in MoMA's display of his free-standing works in lead, including the 1969 ""One Ton Prop (House of Cards)"" and other pieces that seem to defy gravity. ""I think welding is a form of stitching,"" Serra says. But in addition to furniture, these artists moved back and forth a growing vocabulary of post-Minimalist inquiry. ""There was a need for me to get back to the process in relation to dealing with matter,"" says Serra, who is very clear on the point that his work is not Minimalist. To make ""Belts,"" for example, he says, ""We cut rubber into strips or sections, and every time the rubber crossed another piece of rubber, we put a bent nail in it. At the time,"" he adds, ""these pieces were quite abrupt."" Today, starting on MoMA's sixth floor with ""Delineator"" from the mid-1970s, you still can see eyes widen. ""Abrupt"" is one way to describe the realization of how that work's two 10-by-26-foot slabs of steel are laid out. Look up: One of them is hanging over your head on the ceiling. But in an exhibition that runs from a loop of neon tubing to those tidal swirls of steel bent in service to careful, creative calculations, the surprise may be the awe that finally seems to grip even the most reluctant viewer. In something like the way the stages of Serra's career have evolved, the sixth floor and garden somehow prepare you for the second floor's majestic march of new, eerie, defining works. ""Sequence,"" ""Torqued Torus Inversion"" and ""Band"" don't seem to quite touch that reinforced floor. They hover. ""It seems very weightless,"" Serra says, recalling the three weeks it took just to get the sculptures assembled on this vast plain that gathers in, at last, so many years of search, discovery and risk-taking. In 1967 and '68, Serra worked on a handwritten ""Verb List"" now seen by many as a manifesto for what would come. ""To roll, to crease, to fold,"" the list begins. ""Of context, of time, of talk, of photosynthesis, of carbonization,"" it concludes -- ""to continue."" Serra's conversation is as efficient, focused and clean as that list. He moves from work to work, consciously tracking himself in these pieces, intrigued, especially, when he can't fully grasp a work's effects on him. ""There's a redundancy in this piece,"" he says of the new ""Band,"" happily intrigued. ""It seems to be a little maddening."" So is ""to madden"" a new verb in the growing patois-Serra? Set out like mountains in an indoor range of steel, the sculptor's crouching, floating works at MoMA are waiting, after all, for you to decide. They seem patient, purposeful, poised to receive your intelligence in their space. Serra values ""anything that engages people in relation to a work,"" he stresses. ""Anything that says, 'Come here and take a look,' that gets them involved on some level ... different people will come through with different ideas about what it means or what the intention was or what the aesthetic is.""

"(CNN) -- Dutch star Arjen Robben hasn't given up hope of playing in the World Cup after he was diagnosed with a hamstring tear. The Bayern Munich winger was injured during the Netherlands warm-up match against Hungary on Saturday. Scans revealed Robben has a small tear in his left hamstring but he is confident that intense physiotherapy can help salvage his dream of playing in South Africa. He told reporters: ""On Sunday I had the scan and it's just a small tear in my left hamstring. It's the first time I have a injury on that spot of my leg. ""If I just let it heal then I'm back on the field in four to six weeks, but we don't have so much time. I have one chance and I have to go for it. ""(Physio) Dick van Toorn is going to help me. We're going to work incredibly hard. I'm going to fight until I drop. The last 24 hours I have had so much support from all the people around me and that had a positive effect on me. ""After the injury I went to the locker room for a first diagnosis which was very difficult. But it was clear that it wasn't good because I had a lot of pain."" Dutch coach Bert van Marwijk has already confirmed he doesn't intend to call up a replacement for Robben in order to give him as much time as possible to recover.

"(CNN) -- Portugal winger Nani has been ruled out of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa with a collar bone injury. Nani, who plays for English premier League side Manchester United, suffered the injury in a training session with his national side in Portugal, before leaving for the tournament which begins on June 11. Nani's injury was not immediately levelheaded by coach Carlos Queiroz, but the Portuguese football association announced that the winger would not be taking part in the World Cup on their official Web site on Monday. ""After daily assessment of the evolution of the injury, including the carrying out of complementary exams, we have concluded that Nani was not able to compete,"" a statement read. Nani will be replaced in the squad by Benfica midfielder Ruben Amorin, ahead of Portugal's first match against Ivory Coast in Port Elizabeth on 15 June. With Nani watching from the stands, Portugal labored to a 3-0 victory Mozambique in their final warm-up game in Johannesburg on Tuesday. After a goalless first half, Danny collected a pass from Deco to open the scoring in the 51st minute, before striker Hugo Almeida came off the bench to score twice. Nani is the latest Premier League player to succumb to injury in the build-up to the finals. Chelsea duo Michael Essien of  Ghana and John Obi Mikel of Nigeria, and Manchester United's England Captain Rio Ferdinand, are also missing the showpiece. Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba, who also plays for Premier League champions Chelsea, is a doubt for the tournament after breaking his arm in his team's friendly against Japan on Friday. Meanwhile, European champions Spain warmed up for South Africa in style with a 6-0 thrashing of Poland. Winger David Silva and striker David Villa made it 2-0 at half-time before Xabi Alonso added a third early in the second period. Cesc Fabregas and Fernando Torres both marked their returns from injury by coming off the bench to score and Pedro added a sixth ten minutes before full-time. But many people's World Cup favorites suffered an injury scare when Barcelona star Andres Iniesta limped off after 39 minutes with a thigh injury.

"San Clemente, California (CNN) -- Joey Santley's flip-flops rhythmically clap as he strolls through San Clemente's surf ghetto, a cluster of boxy surfboard-making businesses. This chatterbox entrepreneur spouts out ideas like big waves churn up foam. Surfing is a sport with a black spot on its eco-friendly soul, and Santley thinks he found a way to cleanse it. ""We're going to take the biggest pile of trash that our industry makes and we are going to figure out a home for it,"" Santley explains. The shaping and making of surfboards for decades has produced a chemical residue, a toxic white dust that can be found all over the surf ghetto. Santley grabs a plastic bag inside the major surfboard manufacturer Lost, and points down at a pile of polyurethane powder, excess foam that sprinkled from a surfboard-shaping machine. ""I'll come in here and clean up all this stuff,"" explains Santley, using a broom and dustpan to put the polyurethane dust into a plastic garbage bag. ""They can keep cranking [producing surfboards] because it gets too full in here. ""They love it because they don't have to clean up. And I love it because I come and get material for my boards. And if I wasn't doing this, the dust would be going into the landfill over the hill."" Santley estimates that 40 percent or more of each surfboard blank winds up in the dump. The flaky foam waste collects and swirls like light snow throughout the surf ghetto shops. The board makers use high-pressure air hoses to blow off the itchy powder. Santley and his partner, Steve Cox, have now recycled enough foam dust to provide the raw material for 2,000 surfboards. ""It saves room for tomorrow,"" says Mike Giancola, the director of Orange County, California, Waste & Recycling. ""We're glad that they [Santley and Cox] took the initiative and found alternatives to the waste at the Prima landfill. That's the kind of sustainability we like to see."" Surfboards are made from blanks -- board-shaped foam cutouts that are finished at manufacturers such as Lost, where legendary shapers such as Matt ""Mayhem"" Biolos sculpt the final product. Biolos says the average cost of a surfboard is $650 and each board is custom made to the buyer's specifications in flexibility, length, width, thickness and more, down to 1/16 of an inch. ""There is really no other example of it in the sporting world, so we are really spoiled about our equipment,"" says Biolos. ""We can go and get them made in almost any surfing country in the world, to fit our exact specs. It's not like buying a tennis racket or a baseball glove with another athlete's name on it."" So the question hanging ten out there is: Will surfers with spiritual connections to their beloved custom-made boards be willing to ride on recycled material? Professional superstar Cory Lopez says among the many boards he rides are some of Biolos' Lost boards, crafted from Green Foam Blanks. ""Green foam, it works just the same as the other boards but it's just a little more environmentally friendly,"" Lopez told CNN. ""So it's a win-win situation. You have to enjoy the fact that it is good for the environment and the fact that you can go out there and ride it just the same as any other board."" The earliest generation of Green Foam Blanks suffered from a slight flaw that does not affect the ride, but could turn off surfers with their notoriously picky tastes. The surfboards made from recycled foam blanks were dotted with little specs, giving the boards just a slightly dirty or murky finish. But the buzz in San Clemente's surf businesses is newest batches of Green Foam Blanks are less murky and Santley showed off some visibly cleaner next-generation boards. But surfers are the last people who should worry about looks, Santley says. ""I don't know many surfers that wear lipstick and makeup when they surf,"" he says. ""I don't wear lipstick and make up, so what does it matter what it looks like if it [the surfboard] is light and strong and has the right flex and does the job under your feet?"" Green Foam Blanks may have never gone from one of Santley's ideas into the water, if not for a major shake-up in what the Surf Industry Manufacturing Association calls a $190-million-a-year business (about 300,000 surfboards). The dominant supplier of surfboard blanks, Clark Foam, shut down in 2006, opening the market to new firms, including one created by some of its former employees, U.S. Blanks. Santley saw an opportunity to ""green up"" surfing by recycling all that blanks' dust and is now teamed with U.S. blanks. ""Everyone kept saying, 'Don't waste your time, don't waste your time,'"" Santley recalls. ""Finally we got the opportunity to, and a blank manufacturer to do a test. After 50 years of rigid polyurethane production on Earth, we successfully proved our concept in one hour.""","Joey Santley and Steve Cox sweep up polyurethene dust, make surfboard blanks .

"(CNN) -- European champions Inter Milan have announced that former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez has agreed to become their new manager. The Spaniard will replace Jose Mourinho, who quit to join Real Madrid after leading them to the treble of Italian league, cup and European Champions League. ""We have reached an agreement and we have sorted out the final details, which weren't important things,"" Inter president Massimo Moratti told the club's official Web site on Tuesday. ""All that is needed now is a countersignature."" ""Benitez is not in Italy. Tomorrow we will tell you when he will be presented."" Benitez's six-year spell as Liverpool manager was ended by mutual consent last week after a disappointing season in which the club finished seventh in the English Premier League and crashed out of the Champions League in the group stage. The 50-year-old won the Champions League in his first season in 2005, reached the final in 2007 and captured the FA Cup in 2006. Previously, he led Valencia to two Spanish league titles and the UEFA Cup. At Inter, he inherits a club which has won the Italian title the last five years and beat Bayern Munich 2-0 in May to capture the European Cup for the first time since 1965. Benitez favors a similar tactical approach to Mourinho, with two holding midfielders and a counter-attacking style.

"(CNN) -- Israeli coach Avram Grant has been appointed manager of English Premier League club West Ham United. Grant left cash-strapped Portsmouth last month after leading them to the FA Cup final, where they lost to his former club Chelsea, but he could not prevent them from slipping out of the Premier League. He replaces Italian coach Gianfranco Zola, who was sacked by West Ham's owners David Gold and David Sullivan in May, after they narrowly avoided relegation. A statement on West Ham's official Web site read: ""West Ham United are delighted to confirm the appointment of Avram Grant as manager on a four-year contract, subject to being granted a work permit."" Grant, who will be officially unveiled later this month, said: ""I am proud and honored to be the manager of West Ham. It will be an exciting challenge and I am ready to do my best.

I am already looking forward to getting to work with my players in July and preparing for the new season."" Grant was widely praised for his stewardship at crisis-hit Portsmouth, who sank into administration with debts of over $170 million debt. They were deducted nine points as a result, making survival in the Premier League all but impossible. Still, Grant led them to Wembley in the FA Cup. Co-owner David Sullivan said: ""I am delighted to welcome Avram to West Ham and am confident he will prove a success.

"(CNN) -- U.S. Ryder Cup hero Anthony Kim revealed that he is a changed golfer after winning his first PGA Tour title in two years despite playing with a torn thumb ligament. The 24-year-old blew a three-shot lead with nine holes to play before defeating compatriot Vaughn Taylor in a play-off at the Houston Open on Sunday. Kim came to prominence with two victories in 2008 and helped the United States win the Ryder Cup from Europe, but his often petulant behavior on course the following year raised the ire of his fellow professionals, culminating in row with Australian Robert Allenby. Allenby accused Kim of staying out late partying the night before their singles match in the President's Cup teams event, but later apologized. Kim, who told the PGA Tour Web site that he will have surgery on his injured hand after this week's Masters -- golf's first major tournament of the season -- said he was now much more mature. ""I look back at last year... I was just complaining about everything. I felt like I deserved to win without trying. That's not how it is. I've put in a lot of hard work,"" he told PGATour.com. ""There's no reason to pout about a bad shot. Especially the way the economy is right now and a lot of people are struggling. I don't want to kick sand in their face by having a bad attitude out there. ""I worked hard in '08, but to get back here was way harder. I had lost a lot of confidence."" The Redstone course in Texas was set up to simulate the difficult conditions that players will face at Augusta this week, giving Kim hope of a good showing despite his hand impediment. ""This is definitely the hardest and most patient I've ever been,"" he told reporters after winning. ""This is the hardest position I've been in in a golf tournament. ""I think I've seen every bush or tree or hazard. We were in about seven or eight hazards the first three days. Now, I played out of a couple of them, but that's a lot of red lines we're seeing by my golf ball. ""So I feel like this is a culmination of hard work, and the people around me have pushed me along. I feel so grateful that I've got a great team around me to make sure that I keep my head screwed on straight."" The 34-year-old Taylor, whose only PGA Tour titles came in the lower-profile Reno-Tahoe Open in 2004 and 2005, lost on the first hole of the play-off as he hit two bunkers and bogeyed while Kim two-putted from 30 feet for par. Kim, the join third-round leader with Bryce Molder, could have secured victory in the regulation 72 holes but missed a five-foot putt to bogey the last and sign for a two-under-par 70 to be 12-under 276. Taylor climbed the leaderboard with 68, while South Africa's Charl Schwartzel (67) and Canadian Graham Delaet (68) tied for third on 277. World No. 4 Lee Westwood was tied for eighth on 280 after 71 in a group also including Molder, who faded with 74. World No. 3 Phil Mickelson, a two-time Masters champion, was well off the pace on 286 after an up-and-down 71 left him tied for 35th. The American carded three double-bogeys in his first 10 holes, then fired six birdies in a row. Irishman Padraig Harrington, a three-time major winner, was another shot back after a disastrous 77 that included four bogeys and two doubles. South African veteran Ernie Els failed to win his third successive tournament, but finished on a bright note with a five-birdie 69 after recovering from an early double-bogey to finish tied for 44th on 288. Meanwhile, Taiwan's Yani Tseng won the first women's major of the year, the Kraft Nabisco Championship, by one shot from Norway's Suzann Pettersen in Riverside County, California on Sunday. The 21-year-old secured her third win on the LPGA Tour and her second major triumph after carding a final-round four-under-par 68 to finish on 27, while Pettersen closed with 69. Korea's Song-Hee Kim was third on 279 after a 70, while world No. 1 Lorena Ochoa of Mexico was fourth on 282 following a final 73.

"(CNN) -- Arsenal have rejected out of hand a formal offer from Barcelona for their talismanic captain Cesc Fabregas, the English Premier League club confirmed on Wednesday. The Spanish champions officially launched their bid to re-sign the 23-year-old earlier in the day when director general Joan Oliver told reporters an offer had been made. Fabregas came through the youth ranks at the Nou Camp before joining Arsenal in 2003, and declared last month he would like to return to Spain. The midfielder then backtracked by saying that he would put his future in the hands of Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger and instead focus on playing for Spain at the World Cup in South Africa. But Arsenal met Barcelona's offer with a curt response. A statement on their official Web site read: ""Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas is under contract with the club until the summer of 2015. He is a highly valued member of the team and part of our future plans. ""We have followed recent speculation linking Cesc with a move away from the Club but as there has never been any official approach for him, only two informal exchanges, in which we made it abundantly clear that we have no interest in transferring Cesc, we have refrained from publicly passing comment. ""However, yesterday evening we received an offer from Barcelona for Cesc and in response, we immediately and resolutely told them once again that we have no intention of selling our captain. ""To be clear, we will not make any kind of counterproposal or enter into any discussion. Barcelona have publicly stated that they will respect our position and we expect that they will keep their word."" Oliver had earlier told reporters during a presentation of the club's latest sponsorship deal: ""Everybody knows that Cesc wants to sign for Barca and that we also want him to come here, but there is also a third party involved -- Arsenal. ""Any agreement has to be with them. The official window for transfer negotiations opened on June 1, and although we'd had unofficial conversations with them before yesterday, we've now made a formal written offer, which we presented to Arsenal yesterday afternoon."" Barcelona vice-president Rafael Yuste said that director of football Txiki Beguiristain and director Raul Sanllehi were leading the negotiations. ""I'm optimistic that he'll be able to sign for Barca as soon as possible, and it's clear that everybody here will give him a warm welcome,"" Yuste said in quotes on the Barcelona Web site. ""We'll do nothing that might make it more difficult for him to come here, and we won't rush things -- but we won't stop either!"" Meanwhile, Yuste also played down reports that last summer's marquee signing Zlatan Ibrahimovic would be leaving Barcelona after a disappointing first season in Spain. The recent signing of Spain striker David Villa from Valencia for $49 million has put the Sweden international's Nou Camp future under some scrutiny. ""There is no problem with Ibra. He's happy and I hope he'll be here scoring goals as he did last season for many years to come. There's nothing to say other than that we are very satisfied with him,"" Yuste said.","Arsenal reject Barcelona's formal offer for Cesc Fabregas .

I can't relate to rich women who quit their jobs when they get married, underpaid writers who waste all their money on shoes instead of investing in a 401(k), or chicks who are interested in a new dude every 10 minutes. But Miranda? She's a human being who could actually exist in real life, not just on a fancy, fluffy TV show. She was often imperfect or badly dressed, and sometimes she said dumb stuff on dates. Sadly, it's her humanity that makes her the least appealing to many people. If entertainment is aspirational, no woman wants to see a fictionalized version of herself. The Frisky: Jesse James says he ""wanted to get caught"" Mirandas are not as vocal as Carries or as bold as Samanthas, but we're out there. As a Miranda, I tend to date beta males, focus almost to the point of obsession on my career, wear shoes that are more practical than sexy, and proudly call myself a feminist. I'm also fond of dark humor (how Miranda managed to stand Charlotte's perpetually sunny demeanor I will never understand). While she often came off as ""the angry one,"" she was capable of incredible empathy and kindness. I challenge anyone to watch the scenes of her caring for Steve's elderly mother and not feel the same way. [SPOILER ALERT] In ""Sex and the City 2,"" she does something she's needed to do for ages: She quits her corporate law firm gig for a low-key job that will enable her to spend more time with her friends and family. In terms of attaining work-life balance, Miranda does it the best of them all. Isn't that everyone's dream? The Frisky: Stars who are way opposite of the characters they play . Of all the ""girls,"" Miranda is the only one I can see myself hanging out with in real life. It wouldn't be a contest to see who could come up with the craziest outfit or drink the most ridiculous cocktails at an overpriced trendy nightspot. We'd hang out at home, rent movies to snark on, and eat junk food without feeling guilty (even if it came from out of the trash can). In other words? I'm a Miranda, and I'm proud of it. I may not be the most glamorous girl at the party, but I always have a good time. I know which people in my life I can count on, and my feet hurt way less at the end of the night.

"(CNN)  -- Spain needed an injury-time goal from substitute Fernando Llorente to beat Saudi Arabia 3-2 in a World Cup warm-up match in Innsbruck on Saturday. It was a less than convincing performance in Austria for the European champions, who are among the favorites for next month's World Cup. Osama Hawsawi gave Saudi Arabia a shock 16th minute lead before David Villa and Xabi Alonso scored to put Vincente Del Bosque's men ahead. But Mohammed Al-Sahlawi's 74th-minute equalizer -- his deflected shot caught Iker Casillas off balance -- appeared enough to have earned his side a draw. However, Athletic Bilbao striker Llorente, who came on for Villa with 20 minutes remaining, had the final say. He connected with Alonso's corner with a firm header to give Spain a last-gasp victory. Spain face a testing encounter against fellow finalists South Korea on June 3 before they kick off their World Cup campaign with a Group H match against Switzerland on June 16. Honduras and Chile are also in the group. Germany continued their build-up to the finals with an impressive 3-0 win over Hungary in Budapest. Lukas Podolski opened the scoring with a fourth minute penalty before Mario Gomez scored the second midway through the second half. Brazilian-born Cacau then came off the substitutes' bench to score the third. It was his third in two games for his adopted country after a double against Malta and presses his claims for a place in the World Cup squad. Germany coach Joachim Loew must cut two players to trim it down to 23 and said it was not an easy decision. ""The coaches will sit down together on Sunday and Monday with the coaching staff and announce the squad on Tuesday. ""Of course, it will hurt for the players concerned, but unfortunately we can only take 23,"" he told AFP. The United States, who play England in their opening game of the finals, beat Turkey 2-1 in Philadelphia. A crowd of more than 55,000 at Lincoln Financial Field saw Arda Turan open the scoring after 27 minutes for the visitors. But Jozy Altidore equalized just before the hour mark and Fulham striker Clint Dempsey grabbed the winner with 15 minutes remaining after an assist from Landon Donovan. Earlier, Serbia's preparations suffered a setback in a 1-0 defeat to New Zealand, who are also heading to South Africa. The match in Klagenfurt in Austria was decided by a goal from Shane Smeltz in the 22nd minute. He beat Serbia goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovic with a low shot to notch his 16th goal in 29 games for the All-Whites. The result is setback for Serbia, who face Australia -- winners over their neighbors last week -- in Group D in South Africa, as well as Germany and Ghana. New Zealand are in Group F with Italy, Paraguay and Slovakia.","Substitute Fernando Llorente scores late winner as Spain beat Saudi Arabia 3-2 .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid will name Jose Mourinho as their new coach on Monday after the Spanish giants confirmed they had agreed a compensation package with his current club Inter Milan. Mourinho, who led the Italian Serie A side to an unprecedented treble this season, will now be released from his San Siro contract -- which ran until 2012. The Portuguese, who has guided both Porto and Inter to Champions League glory, will be presented at 1:00pm local time on Monday in succession to Manuel Pellegrini -- who was sacked on Wednesday. Blog: Mourinho will bring magic to Madrid . Mourinho reportedly had a release clause which meant Inter were to receive 16 million euros should he depart the club. A joint statement from the two clubs read: ""Presidents Massimo Moratti and Florentino Perez met on Friday and, In light of the excellent and constructive relations between the two clubs, an agreement was reached on the contractual clause that binds Jose Mourinho to FC Internazionale. ""The time and the manner by which the agreement will be honored has been defined. Massimo Moratti thanks Florentino Perez for his willingness to join him in Milan and for his courtesy, which confirms the strong links between the two clubs."" Moratti had earlier told reporters that he was unwilling to compromise with Real on the subject of the release clause. ""Mourinho has been spectacular, intelligent, brave and we acknowledge that,"" said Moratti. ""This doesn't take away the fact that there is still an issue regarding the negotiations with Mourinho and with the club that wants him. ""We want to end Mourinho's negotiations well, but we have a right to defend a position that is based on honesty and legality with regards to an agreement that was done with someone (Mourinho) that did their duty and the club (Inter) that allowed him the chance to free himself of his contract.""","Real Madrid will appoint Jose Mourinho as their new coach on Monday .

"(CNN) -- Democrats have usually conceded the evangelical vote during presidential elections, but Sen. Barack Obama is trying to change that by mobilizing what some call the ""Christian left."" Sen. Barack Obama is expected to talk about faith-based initiatives during a campaign stop in Ohio on Tuesday. As part of his outreach to evangelical voters, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee will tour the Eastside Community Ministry in Zanesville, Ohio, on Tuesday and give an address on how he plans to builda ""real"" partnership between faith-based organizations and the White House if he becomes president. Obama's outreach to evangelical voters has also included private summits with pastors, an effort to reach out to young evangelicals and a fundraiser with the Matthew 25 political action committee. It describes itself as a group of moderate evangelicals, Catholics and Protestants committed to electing the Illinois Democrat president. Matthew 25's name is inspired by a biblical passage, in the 25th chapter of the Gospel of Matthew, in which Jesus says, ""For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink."" The name is meant to signal the group's focus on social justice concerns about hot-button cultural issues. Brian McLaren, a former pastor who spent 24 years in the pulpit and is now an informal adviser to the Obama campaign, believes that a significant portion of evangelical voters are ready to break from their traditional home in the the Republican Party and take a new leap of faith with Obama. ""I think there's a very, very sizable percentage -- I think between a third and half -- of evangelicals, especially younger [evangelicals], who are very open to somebody with a new vision,"" McLaren said.  Watch how young evangelicals are entering politics » . That new vision, he said, isn't focused on traditional social issues like abortion and gay marriage but more on efforts to end global warming and the war in Iraq. ""We've watched the evangelical community be led -- be misled -- by the Republican Party to support things they really shouldn't have supported,"" McLaren said, including ""the blind support for the Iraq war when it was launched on either mistaken or false pretenses."" Unlike previous presidential elections, when the religious right's criticism of Democratic presidential candidates went largely unchallenged, Obama's evangelical supporters rallied around the Democrat when Christian conservative James Dobson accused him of ""deliberately distorting the traditional understanding of the Bible."" Pastor Kirbyjon Caldwell, the Texas minister who officiated at first daughter Jenna Bush's wedding, and ""a coalition of pastors and other Christians ... who are standing up for our Christian faith and supporting Barack Obama"" created a Web site called ""James Dobson Doesn't Speak For Me"" that attempts to refute Dobson's claims with quotes from Obama. ""The Apostle John speaks for me in reminding us of Jesus' command to love one another. The world will know His disciples by that love,"" a statement on the site says. ""These words speak for me. But when James Dobson attacks Barack Obama, James Dobson doesn't speak for me."" Recent polling suggests, however, that a majority of white evangelical voters are still backing Sen. John McCain, though enthusiasm for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee among evangelicals is less than what it was for President Bush in 2004.  Watch McCain fight for the evangelical vote » . In a CNN poll conducted by Opinion Research Corporation on June 4-5, nearly two-thirds of white evangelical voters surveyed, 64 percent, supported McCain, and 30 percent backed Obama. The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 6.5 percentage points. In comparison, Bush received the support of 78 percent of evangelical voters in the 2004 election, according to exit polls. Despite the lower enthusiasm for McCain among rank-and-file evangelicals, leaders of the Christian right movement have already attacked Obama for his social views. In one instance, Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, posted a video on YouTube that challenged Obama's position on abortion. ""Talking about faith issues is not about singing 'Kum Ba Yah,' "" said Charmaine Yoest of the Family Research Council, another conservative evangelical group. ""It's about the public policies the person is going to put in place."" But some leaders of the religious right who worked hard to get Bush into the White House have been underwhelmed by the outreach from the McCain campaign and are less likely to fight for McCain as they did for Bush. For example, in spring 2004, Michael Farris and his organization, Generation Joshua, were heavily involved in the planning for a fall effort to drive evangelical voters to the polls to re-elect Bush. But Harris and his organization had yet to be contacted by the Republican National Committee or McCain's campaign as of mid-June and did not plan any efforts in key swing states as they did in 2004. ""We don't feel invested in his candidacy,"" Farris said, ""and he clearly doesn't feel invested in us."" Farris is not alone among evangelical leaders about his uneasiness with McCain. ""The evangelical community seems to be sitting on the fence to a particular degree,"" said Jacques Berlinerblau, a professor at Georgetown University. And that could give Obama an opportunity, he said. ""If Sen. Obama can get between 30 and 33 percent [of the evangelical vote] in those crucial swing states, he's absolutely golden,"" Berlinerblau said. CNN's Jim Acosta and Rebecca Sinderbrand contributed to this report.","Obama's outreach to evangelicals focuses on social justice, ending Iraq war .

"(CNN)  -- Diego Milito scored in each half as Inter Milan beat Bayern Munich 2-0 to win the Champions League final and claim an historic treble. Jose Mourinho's men had already claimed the Serie A and Italian Cup crowns ahead of Saturday night's showdown with Bayern, who had also achieved the domestic double in Germany. Two clinical finishes from Milito in the 35th and 70th minutes settled an enthralling showdown in the Santiago Bernabeu stadium in Madrid and left Mourinho as only the third coach to win Europe's top club competition with two teams. He achieved the feat with Porto in 2004 before leaving to manage Chelsea in the English Premier League. Bayern had made the better start in terms of possession without creating a clear cut chance before Inter scored the crucial opening goal. Brazilian goalkeeper Julio Cesar hoisted a long kick forward and Milito held off Martin Demichelis to work it back to Wesley Sneijder. The Argentine forward reacted quickly and quickly turned to receive a perfect return pass from Sneijder and clip the ball over Hans Jorg Butt in the Bayern goal. Growing in confidence, Inter should have been two up before the break as Milito turned provider to set up Sneijder, who shot straight at Butt with the goal at his mercy. Bayern, missing the suspended Franck Ribery and with Arjen Robben only an intermittent threat, had a golden chance to equalize in the opening attack of the second half. Hamit Altintop played in Thomas Mueller but the young German striker fluffed the opportunity as he shot straight at Cesar. Robben forced a one-handed save from Cesar before Milito gave Inter a two-goal cushion with more superb finishing. Fellow strike partner Samuel Eto'o gave him the chance to run at the heart of the Bayern defense and he left Daniel van Buyten trailing before beating Butt with some ease. It was his 30th goal in all competitions this season and sixth in the Champions League. Milito also scored the only goal to help Inter beat Siena last weekend to wrap up the Serie A title for the fifth straight year. Bayern could offer little threat as Inter comfortably held on for a deserved triumph having beaten Chelsea and reigning champions Barcelona en-route to the final. It ended a 45-year wait for the Italian giants, who last won the European Cup in 1965. Whether Mourinho will be their coach next season as they attempt to retain the trophy remains the big question, with reports strongly linking him with a move to Real Madrid. With victory assured, Mourinho shook hands with his beaten Bayern counterpart Louis van Gaal before embarking on an emotional celebration with his team, appearing to wave goodbye as he saluted their delirious fans. He later appeared to confirm his departure as he gave post-match interviews. ""I want to be the only coach to win the Champions League with three different clubs,"" AFP quoted him from Italian television. ""It's more likely that I will leave rather than stay.""","Diego Milito scores twice as Inter Milan beat Bayern Munich 2-0 in Champions League final .

"(CNN) -- Ivory Coast coach Sven-Goran Eriksson has selected six strikers in an attacking 23-man squad for the World Cup finals. Chelsea pair Didier Drogba and Salomon Kalou, Aruna Dindane, who recently moved to Qatar League side Lekhwiya, CSKA Moscow's Seydou Doumbia, Lille's Gervinho and Emmanuel Kone, of Romanian club CFR Cluj, have all made the cut. Eriksson has dropped seven players from his original squad, they are goalkeeper Vincent Angban, defender Abdoulaye Meite, midfielders Gilles Yapi Yapo and Emerse Fae, and strikers Bakari Kone, Kanga Akale and Lassina. Yapi Yapo, Fae and Kone all played at the World Cup in Germany in 2006. The Swedish coach informed his players at their base of Gstaad, Switzerland, on Tuesday morning. Blog: ""Dynamite"" Drogba will explode at World Cup . The Elephants have been drawn in the so-called group of death along with Brazil, Portugal and North Korea. They begin their campaign against Portugal on June 15. Much will be expected of Drogba, who finished as the leading scorer in the English Premier League after netting 29 goals for Chelsea. Notable names in the squad include defenders Emmanuel Eboue, of Arsenal, and Manchester City's Kolo Toure, as well midfield duo Didier Zokora, of Sevilla, and Barcelona's Yaya Toure. South Africa coach Carlos Alberto Parreira has dropped the World Cup hosts' all-time record scorer Benni McCarthy for the tournament starting on June 11. The 32-year-old has struggled for form and fitness this season, having moved English clubs from Blackburn to West Ham, but was recalled by Parreira after the Brazilian returned for his second stint in charge. However, McCarthy -- who played at the 1998 and 2002 World Cups -- featured in only one of the team's four warm-up friendlies and was an unused substitute as Bafana Bafana romped to a national record 5-0 win over Guatemala on Monday night. Uncapped goalkeeper Shuaib Walters of mid-table South African club Maritzburg was picked ahead of Rowen Fernandez, who plays for German club Arminia Bielefeld, in the 23-man squad named on Tuesday. Bryce Moon, who plays in Greece, also missed out along with fellow defender Innocent Mdledle and midfielder Franklin Cale, both of SA Premier Soccer League runners-up Mamelodi Sundowns. Blog: The World Cup's missing men . ""It was a very difficult and sad decision to make, some of these boys who have been left out have been with me since the Durban training camp in January,"" Parreira told the South African Football Association Web site. ""But at the end of the day we have to follow the rules and regulations because FIFA wants only 23 players. My decision of leaving out these players was based on certain principles: physical condition, technical level, tactical knowledge, discipline as well as adjusting to the shape of the team. ""But I would like to say to them, 'Thank you very much for your efforts, don't lose hope, just keep your heads high and remember that you are not failures.' This is also a sad time for everyone in the team."" The squad includes seven overseas-based players, including captain Aaron Mokoena -- who became the first South African to win 100 caps against Guatemala -- and midfielders Steven Pienaar, Kagisho Dikgacoi and Macbeth Sibaya. Bernard Parker of Dutch champions Twente was one of only three strikers named along with Katlego Mphela and Siyabonga Nomvete. Blog: Who will be the World Cup's best player? Everton striker Victor Anichebe and fellow forward Ike Uche were dropped from Nigeria's final 23-man squad. The duo lost out to a pool of forwards featuring three of Anichebe's fellow Premier League players: Yakubu Aiyegbeni, Nwankwo Kanu and John Utaka. Wolfsburg frontman Obafemi Martins, Osaze Odemwingie of Lokomotiv Moscow and Chinedu Ogbuke Obasi will also compete for starting berths in attack. Midfielder Jon Obi Mikel was included despite missing the end of Chelsea's season due to minor knee surgery. New coach Lars Lagerback also dropped his only two Nigeria-based players, goalkeeper Bassey Akpan and Peter Suswan, as well as Peter Utaka, Onyekachi Apam and Brown Ideye. The Super Eagles open their campaign against Argentina in Johannesburg on June 12, and will also play Greece and South Korea in Group B. Cameroon coach Paul Le Guen gave Rigobert Song the chance to appear at his fourth World Cup, along with his nephew Alex Song of English club Arsenal. Tottenham defenders Benoit Assou-Akotto and Sebastien Bassong also made the 23-man cut, despite missing the Africa Cup of Nations. Inter Milan striker Samuel Eto'o will continue as captain, having replaced Song when Paul Le Guen took charge last year. While striker Jacques Zoua was already out through injury, the French coach also left out Jean Patrick Abouna Ndzana, Amour Patrick Tignyemb, Makadji Boukar, Jean Patrick Abouna Ndzana, Marcel Ndjeng, Patrick Mevoungou and Dorge Kouemaha. Cameroon are in Group E, along with the Netherlands, Denmark and Japan. Ghana captain Michael Essien has been ruled out of the World Cup due to injury, dealing a major blow to the Black Stars' hopes of success in the first tournament to be held in Africa. The midfielder has not played for his English club Chelsea since December, but Ghana coach Milovan Rajevac picked the 27-year-old in his preliminary 29-man squad in the hope that he would be fit to play in the tournament. But the Ghana Football Association announced that Essien, who has won more than 50 caps and is known affectionately by fans as ""The Bison,"" will not be ready before the month-long tournament finishes in mid-July. ""An evaluation by a combined team of medical experts from the Ghana Football Association and Chelsea Football Club revealed that Essien will not make full recovery until the end of July,"" it said in a statement on its Web site. Essien's latest problems began six months ago when he suffered a hamstring injury in a European Champions League match, but he returned to fitness in time for Ghana's second match at the African Nations Cup in January. But he then injured his knee in training, partially tearing medial ligament, and he needed to have several operations to repair the damage. The former Lyon player also suffered a serious knee injury in 2008 which sidelined him for six months. Earlier this month, Rajevac also named John Mensah in his preliminary squad despite the defender's injury problems. Mensah, who also plays in England on loan with Sunderland, has been sidelined with a calf injury arising from a physical complication which has plagued him in recent years. Midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng, who also plays in England, was named by the Serbian coach after deciding to switch nationality. The Portsmouth player was born in Germany, who he has represented at under-21 level, but has a Ghanaian father and his uncle has played for the Black Stars. Rajevac also recalled Inter Milan midfielder Sulley Muntari, who was dropped for the Africa Cup of Nations in January after deciding not to play in a friendly against Angola. Algeria coach Rabah Saadane added five players to his initial 25-man squad to cover for injuries. Lazhar Hadj Aissa, Hocine Metref and Khaled Lemmouchia of Algerian club ES Setif have joined the Desert Foxes' Swiss training camp along with Mohamed Meftah of JS Kabylie and Germany-based striker Chadli Amri. Defender Nadir Belhadj and goalkeeper Faouzi Chaouchi were selected despite being banned for the opening Group C match against Slovenia due to red cards received in the Africa Cup of Nations semifinal against Egypt. While Portsmouth's Belhadj can play in the second game against Hameur Bouazza, Chaouchi is suspended until the final pool clash with the United States. Key midfielder Mourad Meghni, who plays for Italian club Lazio, has been ruled out of the finals with a knee problem that requires surgery.","Sven Goran Eriksson names an attack-minded Ivory Coast squad .

Pellegrini, 56, paid the price for failing to win a trophy in his only season in Madrid. Real finished on 96 points, three behind champions Barcelona, and went out of the Champions league in the last 16.

My first husband and I divorced 15 years ago, and I married Haskell in 1999. To borrow from humorist Erma Bombeck when writing about her stepfather, if Haskell had been the relief pitcher brought in to bail out his team, the crowd would have cheered.  Had he been the off-duty cop who delivered the baby because the ambulance was stuck in traffic, he would have been called a hero. Or had he been the understudy who filled in when the beloved star got sick, he might have gotten rave reviews. But Haskell wasn't any of these things. Instead, when he became my husband, Haskell also became stepfather to my two children, God bless him.  To the kids, he was like instant iced tea, not the steeped kind; store-bought cookies, not freshly baked; store brand cola, not the real thing. Simply put, he was not their biological father. In the eyes of my children, Haskell was an alien who appeared one day, hypnotized their mother and set up camp in their home, toting his organic food, reggae music, incense and all things African. He was someone to endure, if not at times ignore -- that is until they needed a ride somewhere, the latest cell phone or a new computer. The first few years in what sociologists call ""a blended family"" can sometimes be open warfare.  I understand why. Children often resent the sudden realignment of their home and their lives. ""You're not my father,"" the kids would sometimes yell at him, ""you can't tell me what to do!"" And when he looked to me for backup, he'd often have to hear:  ""You're not their father so you can't tell them what to do!"" I might have had my reasons then, but I regret that now. I think of all the times Haskell had to play second fiddle at the birthday parties, graduations and even my daughter's debutante ball. I know it had to be painful when the children hung photos of their ""nuclear family"" on their bedroom walls and he was nowhere in them.  For the most part, he put up with all this generously and without a fuss, and I appreciate that.  It was a tough time for all of us. But over the past 13 years that Haskell has been in our lives, and after hundreds of family meetings, hours of group therapy sessions and more than a dozen self-help books, (including ""Step-parenting for Dummies""), I've finally noticed a change of hearts. It is now clear Haskell has had a tremendous impact on my -- let me rephrase -- our children's lives. For instance, my husband has devoted his entire life to the economic development of Africa.  It is no coincidence that our 27-year-old son is a successful businessman living in Africa.  And our 23-year-old daughter is serving in the Peace Corps; Haskell was one of the first Americans to serve in the Peace Corps in Ethiopia in 1962. So although I can say I am proud that our children have independently chosen to lead lives of global service, I am equally convinced that it is due in part to Haskell's influence in their lives. Research shows that a good father can help set his children on the right course in life. In studies of children in homes headed by single mothers, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found that many children without active fathers have lower grade point averages, lower college aspirations, poor school attendance records, higher dropout rates and are more likely to be in trouble with the law than children who live with both parents. Sociologists have also concluded adolescent girls from 15 to 19 years old reared in homes without fathers are significantly more likely to engage in premarital sex and get pregnant than girls reared in homes with a mother and a father.  So the presence of fathers in our homes is not only important. It is sometimes vital. Each home is different, and every family has its own particular challenges, often including the challenge of a failed father or one who is absent altogether. But no matter whether the men who have a positive influence on the lives of our children are their birth fathers or their stepfathers, grandfathers, uncles, brothers or teachers, their contributions are important.  And we should include these men when we celebrate Father's Day. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Leah Ward Sears.","Leah Ward Sears: On Father's Day, we should celebrate contributions of stepfathers .

"(CNN) -- The oil spill on the Gulf Coast has states and visitors bureaus working hard to keep the public updated and reassure beach-bound travelers. Here are some of the latest updates from destinations affected by the oil disaster: . Northwest Florida . The Escambia County Health Department has rescinded a health advisory that had been issued for beaches stretching from the Florida-Alabama border to the entrance of the Perdido Unit of the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Government officials said that there was no oil sheen or oil slick observed in the water from the high water mark out to 100 yards from shore. Over the weekend, isolated tar balls appeared along several beaches of south Walton County, but all 15 beach communities remain open, according to the Walton County Tourist Development Council's website. A no-swim advisory has been lifted for Fort Walton Beach, Destin and Okaloosa Island, according to the Emerald Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau, which represents the three destinations. ""While crews continue to work to remove any remaining tar balls that may have floated ashore, visitors and locals alike are invited to enjoy the beaches as they normally would,"" the visitors bureau website said. iReport: See photos from Okaloosa Island . Dime-size to 5-inch tar balls continue to wash up in widely scattered areas of northwest Florida, but all of the state's beaches remain open, according to Visit Florida, the state's tourism corporation. ""There have been no reports of Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill-related oil products reaching the shore beyond the Northwest Florida region,"" Visit Florida's website said. iReport: Share your photos of affected beaches . Scattered tar balls and oil patches have affected Panama City Beach. ""The beaches are open and the swimming is still safe,"" the area's visitors bureau website said. The water at Pensacola Beach is also open for swimming, according to the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. ""Very light and sporadic tar balls have been reported on Pensacola Beach,"" the bureau's website said. Gulf Islands National Seashore . All of the Gulf Islands National Seashore sites, which are in Florida and Mississippi, are open, the National Park Service's website said. Fort Pickens, Florida, has experienced tar balls on shore, and skimming boats have been collecting oil offshore at Petit Bois Island, Mississippi, and Perdido Pass. ""Surveillance for oiling continues throughout all park areas on a daily basis. Cleanup operations continue throughout the park,"" the website said. Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama . Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama, have experienced significant oiling, according to the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau. ""The beaches are open and visitors are still welcome to sunbathe and walk the beach, but we strongly suggest they swim in a pool or enjoy our many off-beach activities,"" the site said. The Alabama Department of Public Health has issued an advisory against swimming in waters off Gulf Shores, Orange Beach and Fort Morgan or in bay waters close to Fort Morgan, Bayou St. John, Terry Cove, Cotton Bayou and Old River. Grand Isle, Louisiana . Oil is affecting more than 45 miles of Louisiana coast, according to a state emergency website, although most of the coast is unaffected. ""The primary affected area is from the mouth of the Mississippi River extending east.

"(CNN) -- France and the Netherlands both recorded narrow home victories in warm-up matches ahead of next month's World Cup in South Africa. Robin van Persie scored twice as the Dutch defeated fellow finalists Mexico 2-1 and Mathieu Valbuena grabbed an 83rd minute winner on his debut in France's 2-1 victory over Costa Rica. Van Persie, playing his first international for six months following an ankle injury, scored from close range with his right foot to make it 1-0, before smashing home his second on the volley. Who will be the World Cup's best player? Mexico pulled a goal back 15 minutes from time when Manchester United-bound Javier Hernandez headed in a cross from the left. Tottenham's Giovani Dos Santos had a chance to level the score, but his powerful shot was tipped over the bar by Dutch goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg. Costa Rica, who are not going to South Africa after losing a play-off to Uruguay in November, took a surprise lead in the 12th minute when Carlos Hernandez's long-range shot bounced over Steve Mandanda's hands. Yoann Gourcuff had a goal ruled out for offside before France claimed their leveler via an own-goal. Jeremy Toulalan fed Franck Ribery, whose shot was deflected into his own net by Douglas Sequeira. The game appeared to be heading for a draw before Valbuena came off the bench to slam in the winner seven minutes from time. Meanwhile, Edson Buddle and Herculez Gomez were the surprise names in the 23-man U.S. squad for the World Cup. Coach Bob Bradley cut seven players from his initial roster, namely defenders Chad Marshall and Heath Pearce; midfielders Alejandro Bedoya, Sacha Kljestan and Robbie Rogers; and forwards Brian Ching and Eddie Johnson. The Americans, beaten 4-2 by the Czech Republic on Tuesday, take on England on June 12 in Rustenburg in their opening World Cup match. England striker Wayne Rooney has played down fears he is not fully fit. Rooney suffered from groin and ankle injuries towards the end of the season with Manchester United and had a stiff neck during England's 3-1 victory over Mexico on Monday. ""Fitness-wise I feel good,"" Rooney told reporters at the England camp.

"(CNN) -- Slipknot bassist Paul Gray's death two months ago was from an accidental morphine overdose, the Polk County, Iowa, medical examiner said Monday. Gray, 38, was found dead by staff at a hotel near Des Moines, Iowa on May 24, said Sgt. Dave Disney of the Urbandale Police Department. Toxicology test results showed a fatal level of morphine and fentanyl -- a synthetic morphine -- in Gray's body, said Dr. Gregory Schmunk. Schmunk also noted the presence of significant heart disease, according to a police statement Monday. The autopsy did show that Gray had been dead for several hours before his body was found, Schmunk said. Grammy-winning metal band Slipknot -- whose fans are affectionately known as ""maggots"" -- was formed in Des Moines in late 1995 and became immediately recognizable for the dark and often grotesque homemade Halloween masks its nine members wore on stage. The band won a Grammy award in 2006 for best metal performance for ""Before I Forget."" Slipknot's self-titled debut album went platinum in 2000. Its fourth album, ""All Hope is Gone,"" spent 69 weeks on Billboard's Top 200 charts, debuting at No. 1 its first week in 2008. Gray was arrested in Iowa in 2003 on drug possession charges when police found small amounts of marijuana, two syringes and a substance that field-tested positive for cocaine after he was involved in a wreck with another motorist.

"(CNN) -- Authorities searching for a missing Oregon boy are seeking information from the public on the child's stepmother. The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office released a flier Friday with pictures of Terri Horman, who told investigators she last saw her stepson, Kyron Horman, 7, inside Skyline Elementary School in Portland on June 4. A form to be filled out and returned to the police by anyone who was at the school the day Kyron disappeared was attached to the flier. ""At any time did you see Terri Horman at or near the school?"" was among the questions in the form. Capt. Jason Gates issued the following statement Friday on the decision to request information on Kyron's stepmother: . ""Detectives work in this case is exhaustive and they, along with Kyron's family, are asking for the community's assistance regarding anyone who saw not only Kyron, but also who may have seen Terri Horman and/or the truck she was driving that morning. Terri is the last person known to have seen him before he disappeared."" In a brief phone interview with CNN, sheriff spokeswoman Lt. Mary Lindstrand said the focus of the investigation is not on Terri Horman. ""We're looking for every bit of information that we can,"" Lindstrand said. ""We are not in a position to name anybody a person of interest."" The two-week-old case has been labeled a criminal investigation, involving one of the largest police search and rescue operations in state history. Kyron's family released a statement Friday urging the public to help bring him home. ""It has been two weeks since our son, Kyron, disappeared,"" the family said. ""For the last 14 days, we haven't been able to talk to him, see him playing around the house, or tuck him in bed. Any parent would understand the grief this has caused our family. ""Father's Day is Sunday. For the first time in seven years, we will not have Kyron around to hug and talk to. It hurts us deeply and our hearts are broken,"" the statement reads. Kyron was wearing dark cargo pants and a black T-shirt with the ""CSI"" logo on it at the time of his disappearance. He is 3-foot-8, weighs 50 pounds and has brown hair and blue eyes.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has struck down a federal law designed to stop the sale and marketing of videos showing dogfights and other acts of animal cruelty, saying it is an unconstitutional violation of free speech. The 8-1 decision was a defeat for animal rights groups and congressional sponsors of the unusual legislation. The specific case before the court dealt with tapes showing pit bulldogs attacking other animals and one another in staged confrontations. The justices Tuesday concluded the scope and intent of the decade-old statute was overly broad. ""The First Amendment itself reflects a judgment by the American people that the benefits of its restrictions on the government outweigh its costs,"" said Chief Justice John Roberts. He concluded Congress had not sufficiently shown ""depictions"" of dogfighting were enough to justify a special category of exclusion from free speech protection. The high court threw out the conviction of Robert Stevens, a Pittsville, Virginia, man who sold videos through his business, Dogs of Velvet and Steel. According to court records, undercover federal agents found he was advertising his tapes in Sporting Dog Journal, an underground magazine on illegal dogfighting. ""This is what I was hoping for,"" Stevens told CNN just after the ruling was announced. ""I am not nor have I ever been a dog fighter or a promoter of dogfighting. I am a journalist and an author."" Among the products Stevens advertised was ""Catch Dogs,"" featuring pit bulls chasing wild boars on organized hunts and a ""gruesome depiction of a pit bull attacking the lower jaw of a domestic farm pig,"" according to the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based appeals court that ruled on the case earlier. Stevens was charged in 2004 with violating interstate commerce laws by selling depictions of animal cruelty. He was later sentenced to 37 months in prison, and promptly appealed. That sentence was put on hold pending resolution of this appeal. He argued his sentence was longer than the 14 months given professional football player Michael Vick, who ran an illegal dogfighting ring. It was the first prosecution in the United States to proceed to trial under the 1999 law. The video marketer is not related to Justice John Paul Stevens, who turned 90 Tuesday. The court made no mention of the milestone as it held a two-hour public session. Nearly every state and local jurisdiction have their own laws banning mistreatment of wild and domesticated animals, and usually handle prosecutions of animal cruelty. Several media organizations had supported Stevens, worrying the federal law could implicate reports about deer hunting, and depictions of bullfighting in Ernest Hemingway novels. Roberts agreed, saying, ""We read [the federal law] to create a criminal prohibition of alarming breadth."" ""Jurisdictions permit and encourage hunting, and there is an enormous national market for hunting-related depictions in which a living animal is intentionally killed,"" said Roberts. ""An otherwise-lawful image of any of these practices, if sold or possessed for commercial gain within a state that happens to forbid the practice, falls within the prohibition of [the federal law]."" During oral arguments in October, the justices offered a number of wide-ranging hypotheticals over what the law could forbid, including: fox hunts, pate de foie gras from geese, cockfighting, bullfighting, shooting deer out of season, even Roman gladiator battles. Only Justice Samuel Alito dissented in the case, and he focused on one of the most disturbing aspects raised in the appeal, the marketing of so-called ""crush"" videos, in which women -- with their faces unseen -- are shown stomping helpless animals such as rabbits to death with spiked-heel shoes or with their bare feet. ""The animals used in crush videos are living creatures that experience excruciating pain. Our society has long banned such cruelty,"" he said. The courts, he said, have ""erred in second-guessing the legislative judgment about the importance of preventing cruelty to animals."" He predicted mores crush videos will soon flood the underground market, because the ruling has ""the practical effect of legalizing the sale of such videos."" Roberts suggested a law specifically banning crush videos might be valid, since it would be narrowly tailored to a specific type of commercial enterprise. Alito noted that would not help dogs forced to fight each other, where, he said, ""the suffering lasts for years rather than minutes."" The government had argued a ""compelling interest"" in stopping people who would profit from dog attack tapes and similar depictions. Roberts dismissed suggestions by the Justice Department that only the most extreme acts of cruelty would be targeted. ""The First Amendment protects against the government,"" Roberts said. ""We would not uphold an unconstitutional statute merely because the government promised to use it responsibly."" The Humane Society, other animal rights groups and 26 states backed the government. If the law had been upheld, it would have been only the second time the Supreme Court had identified a form of speech undeserving of protection by the First Amendment. The justices in 1982 banned the distribution of child pornography. This is the second time this year the high court has tossed out federal legislation on free speech grounds. The justices in January nullified parts of a sweeping campaign finance reform law, giving corporations, unions, and advocacy groups more power to bankroll federal elections.","Justices say banning the videos is an unconstitutional violation of free speech .

"New York (CNN) -- Those following the news of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico may be surprised at how much is still unknown about the extent and movement of the oil, in particular below the sea surface, as engineers and scientists attempt to stanch the flow. More than five weeks after the oil rig disaster, and even with today's sophisticated technology, tracking and measuring the spill remains a huge challenge. Understanding fundamental difficulties with measuring in deep water helps explain why. Because oil is lighter than water, it tends to rise to the surface and form slicks that can be very damaging to the natural ecosystem, and ultimately the regional economy, as we are seeing now. Spraying chemical dispersants on the slick, as BP has, is one way to remove oil from the surface. The dispersants break the slick into small droplets, which are transferred down into the water column by waves and turbulence. BP has also injected dispersants into the oil plumes rising from the oil rig's broken plumbing on the seabed to try to prevent oil slicks from forming on the surface at all. This appears to have been at least partly successful in reducing the size of the surface slicks. The oil that does not reach the surface is dispersed through the water column by ocean currents. Instruments lowered from a research ship in the gulf have detected large oil plumes near the leak, more than 3,000 feet down. This is therefore the first spill where large plumes of oil have been observed spreading below the sea surface. While we have some understanding of how much oil is sitting at the surface and where it is heading, we have virtually no idea how much oil and dispersants are drifting below the surface of the gulf, nor do we know where these pollutants are going. It is notoriously difficult to take measurements at that depth. We can remotely survey large areas of the sea surface with planes and satellites but surveying the ocean's interior is vastly more difficult. Water blocks electromagnetic waves, such as light and radar, preventing us from imaging the deep. To map underwater concentrations of oil and dispersants, instruments need to be lowered into the plumes to take measurements and samples that are later analyzed in a lab. Close to the source, where oil-droplet concentrations are high, it may be possible to map the plumes using sound waves, but dissolved chemicals, such as dispersants, cannot be detected with such acoustic methods at all. In other words, we can ""see"" what is at the surface, but to find out what is going on beneath the waves, we need to put our ""feelers"" out. Decades of research on natural plumes, such as those rising from deep-water, hydrothermal hot springs on midocean ridges, and man-made plumes, such as sewage outfalls, have taught us that mapping subsurface plumes is time-consuming and costly. To put this into perspective, consider how hard it would be to map the ash cloud from the erupting volcano in Iceland if, instead of satellites, we were forced to use weather balloons. Near the source of the oil plumes in the gulf, the sampling problem is particularly severe because ""young"" plumes tend to be extremely patchy (the oil distribution is very uneven). Varying ocean currents, such as tides and eddies, move the plume patches around continuously and randomly, and cause the plumes to spread. This makes sampling both easier, because the plumes become less patchy and therefore harder to miss; and more difficult, because the plumes become more dilute and therefore harder to detect. With each passing day the problem gets worse as the oil spill's boundaries grow. In recent days, scientists began mapping the subsurface oil plumes by ship and using unmanned underwater robots (floats and gliders). Unfortunately, these plume surveys are unlikely to produce a reliable estimate of the amount of oil dispersing through the gulf, especially since much of the oil may already be too dilute to detect. To determine the extent of the oil spill, we will need to combine measurements with computer modeling. But even a perfect model cannot make valid predictions if the data are wrong. Therefore, it is crucial that the amount of oil leaking into the gulf be estimated accurately. I am hopeful that the recently formed ""Flow Rate Technical Group,"" a multi-agency team that includes the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, will be able to carry out this task with minimal outside interference. It is equally important, however, to continue to collect data on the circulation in the gulf over the full water depth to validate and improve the realism of models for this spill. And monitoring the circulation should continue even after the oil leak has been stopped, until the oil has dispersed sufficiently so as not to pose any further biological risk. In this way, we will have a better idea of the full environmental impact of this incident. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andreas Thurnherr.","Andreas Thurnherr says it may surprise that much still unknown about spill's flow in deep sea .
Surface oil can be measured, he says, but vagaries of dispersal at depths thwart technology .
Thurnherr: Data collection must continue when spill is done to gauge environmental impact ."
"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- Brazilian World Cup winner Bebeto believes his country's current crop of stars are capable of earning a record-extending sixth title in South Africa. The former striker, now 46, was a member of 1994 team that triumphed in the United States along with the likes of Romario and captain Dunga, who is now Brazil's national coach. He scored three goals in that tournament, and made the headlines after celebrating his effort in the quarterfinal against the Netherlands by racing to the touchline and rocking his arms back and forth in honor of the recent birth of his third child. That year Brazil became the first country to win the World Cup four times, having last triumphed in 1970. They managed it under the guidance of coach Carlos Alberto Parreira, who is now in charge of 2010 hosts South Africa. Brazil won a dour final on penalties against Italy after the match ended 0-0 following extra-time, and Dunga has been criticized for instigating a similar tactical approach as he left out talented but faded stars such as Ronaldinho and Adriano from his 23-man World Cup squad. But Bebeto told CNN's Pedro Pinto that Dunga deserves to be given time to impress, having opened the event with a hard-fought 2-1 win over North Korea ahead of Sunday's second Group G clash with the Ivory Coast at Johannesburg's Soccer City. ""I think that this squad is a very strong one. There already world champions in it: Lucio, Juan, Kaka, and others that already won the cup,"" he said. ""Experience is important. Dunga is working with a group of winners: they came top of their qualifying group, they won the Confederations Cup here in South Africa [in 2009] and they won Copa America. How it is possible to say something against this kind of squad?"" Bebeto agreed that there were similarities between Dunga's team and that of 1994. ""It's a hard-working team. It will be very hard to score against Brazil,"" he said. ""I think they have the best defense in the world, starting with our goalkeeper -- that makes them similar to the champions in '94. ""When we won in '94, we were already together for 40 days. And that helped a lot. So we need to be patient, and let Dunga do his job. Players like Kaka and Robinho can make the difference. ""Luis Fabiano too, even if he's not in peak condition, and Kaka as well. But a player like Kaka, if he feels good, oh my God..."" Kaka has struggled to find form after an injury-hit first season with Real Madrid in Spain, having left Italian club AC Milan where he had been hailed as the best player in the world. Forward Robinho has regained the form that prompted English club Manchester City to break the British transfer record in 2008, but only after returning home on loan to Santos.","Former World Cup winner Bebeto believes Brazil can claim sixth title in South Africa .

"Palisades, New York (CNN) -- About six weeks ago, a large earthquake devastated Haiti and killed over 200,000 people. Saturday, a huge earthquake releasing 500 times more energy, devastated Chile and killed hundreds. So why did the smaller earthquake kill so many more people? And why the sudden spate of disastrous earthquakes in the Americas? No, the apocalypse is not coming. No, the two earthquakes are not linked in any way. And no, Pat Robertson, you can't blame the Devil or the French. The real answers, for those comfortable with science and the Enlightenment, are tectonics and poverty. Of the many revolutions of the 1960s, the one that really mattered to geologists was the revolution of plate tectonics. Tectonics is the word geologists use to describe the process by which mountains move and rocks squeeze and crunch. In the sixties, new data from research cruises and from earthquake seismometers led to the realization that tectonics makes mountains slide sideways long distances. Earth scientists discovered that the Earth has a patchy skin of mobile plates a hundred miles thick and thousands of miles across, and that they move horizontally at a slow but irresistible pace. It's where they collide that our problems begin. South America is a prime example of this process, one that geologists call ""subduction."" It's why we have the long chain of mountains called the Andes and it's why countries like Chile and Peru suffer giant, destructive earthquakes every few decades. Off the coast of Chile is a tectonic plate called the Nazca Plate. Unseen by most, it has been inching its way towards the South American continent, and sliding underneath it, for well over a hundred million years. Since the day that Magellan first rounded Tierra del Fuego it has encroached by 130 feet in a roughly east-north-east direction. The Nazca plate doesn't slide under the South American plate in an orderly fashion though. It moves in fits and starts, sometimes sticking and sometimes slipping, sometimes here and sometimes there. Along the coast of Chile, patches can get stuck for over a hundred years. When they do finally slip, they go with a bang. All that squeezing energy is released in seconds and an earthquake happens. On Saturday a patch roughly the size of Maryland came unstuck, unleashing one of the most powerful tremors ever recorded. Fifty years ago, a patch four times bigger and with an area of about 50,000 square miles, the size of Louisiana, slipped and triggered the Valdivia earthquake. Its magnitude has been estimated as at least 9.5, making it the largest earthquake of modern times. Over millions of years, this tectonic squeezing has formed the Andes and raised the high desert known as the Altiplano. Elsewhere it has created the Alps, the Rockies, the Himalayas, and Tibet. It has also created and distorted some of the islands of the Caribbean, including Haiti. So that's why some parts of the world suffer from big earthquakes that strike with irregular frequency, while other regions are seismically quiet: it all depends on where the plates meet and how fast they are running into each other. Knowing this helps us assess seismic risk and mitigate it. It helps us know where the strongest earthquake shaking will hit and roughly how often. Predicting when the shaking will hit is a much greater challenge, and geophysicists are working hard to reach that goal. In any case, prediction is not the real problem: poverty is. Poverty is what ultimately kills most people during an earthquake. Poverty means that little or no evaluation is made of seismic risk in constructing buildings and no zoning takes place. It means that building codes are not written, and even if they do exist they are difficult, or impossible, to enforce. It means the choice between building robustly or building cheaply is not a choice at all. Haiti is a tragic illustration of this. Weak building materials and poor construction standards share much of the blame for the grotesque numbers of fatalities, injured and internally displaced people. Of course it's complicated. Earthquake shaking is a complex process and the chain of causation from earthquake source magnitude through infrastructural damage to human harm involves factors like the type of earthquake fault, its orientation, the hardness of bedrock or presence of wet soil, and so on. A lot also depends on the time of day the earthquake strikes in terms of how many people are inside buildings that could collapse. Population density, distance from the epicenter, and the depth of the rupture are the most important factors of all. Nevertheless, those countries most at risk of seismic tragedy are not simply those on tectonic plate boundaries, but also those with the least money to spend on protecting themselves. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Colin Stark.","Chile's quake released 500 times more energy than Haiti's, says Colin Stark .
Earthquake's magnitude is related to movement of plates on earth's surface, Stark says .
Quake damage partly due to level of poverty, quality of building techniques, he says ."
"(CNN)  -- Roger Federer will open his defense of the men's singles title at Wimbledon against world number 65 Alejandro Falla of Colombia. Falla has never advanced beyond the second round at Wimbledon and should offer few fears to Federer, who is bidding for a seventh title in the grass court grand slam. World number one Rafael Nadal, seeded two at the All England Club, faces Kei Nishikori of Japan in his first-round match, but faces a potentially tougher task in the second, where he could play American James Blake, who is returning after a knee injury. Federer looks set to have a generally easy first week, but is in the same half of the draw as Andy Roddick, Novak Djokovic and 2002 Wimbledon champion Lleyton Hewitt -- who beat him in the final of the Halle tournament last Sunday. Three-time runner-up Roddick will open against fellow American Rajeev Ram while Andy Murray will take on Jan Hajek of the Czech Republic. Scot Murray is attempting to become Britain's first men's singles champion since Fred Perry in 1936 and will be the total focus of home support. For the first time in the tournament's history, no English player has made the main draw for the men's singles after the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) imposed tougher qualification criteria on wild cards. In the women's singles, a wildcard has been awarded to 16-year-old Briton Laura Robson and the 2008 Wimbledon Junior Girls' champion has been handed a tough test against fourth seed Jelena Jankovic of Serbia. Defending women's champion and top seed Serena Williams has been drawn in the first round against Michelle Larcher de Brito of Portugal. Williams has 2004 champion Maria Sharapova and French Open runner-up Samantha Stosur in her half of the draw while her sister and second seed Venus Williams could face Belgians Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin.","Roger Federer drawn against Colombian Alejandro Falla in Wimbledon first round .

"(CNN) -- Fueled by hot, dry conditions, a wildfire near Flagstaff in northern Arizona grew to 10,000 acres, city officials said late Monday. The blaze spread so quickly, it caught some locals off guard.  Flagstaff city spokeswoman Kimberly Ott said the source of the fire was an abandoned campfire. The Schultz Fire ignited late Sunday morning, shutting down part of U.S. Route 89 and causing the Coconino County  Sheriff's Office to evacuate at least 748 properties, including two residential neighborhoods, an animal shelter and the Sunset Crater and Wupatki National Monuments. The sheriff's office is recommending that nearby residents put together evacuation kits. ""It's something that unless you've lived through it, I don't think you can imagine,"" evacuee Patti Vorhees told CNN affiliate KTVK as she packed up her pets and left. ""You literally take your prescriptions, your animals and the clothes on your back."" The Red Cross has set up a shelter at Mount Elden Middle School in Flagstaff. The Coconino County website says the U.S. Forest Service and several fire departments responded with about 300 firefighters, eight air tankers and five helicopters to put out the blaze. A Type One Incident Management Team also was sent to the scene. The U.S. Fire Administration website says that's a self-contained team of 35 to 50 highly trained personnel deployed to manage incidents of ""national significance."" High winds in the area Sunday didn't help. The winds both stoked the flames and caused emergency crews to ground the air tankers for 5 1/2 hours Sunday afternoon. CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said gusty southwesterly winds, from 20 to 30 mph, will blow through the area through Tuesday, then calm by Wednesday morning. There's a slight chance of showers and thunderstorms in the area beginning on Thursday, Morris said. Government fire spokesman Eric Neitzel told CNN affiliate KPHO that higher humidity and lower temperatures overnight allowed firefighters to ""make some good progress on the line"" and protect structures. KTVK's website, www.azfamily.com, says authorities shut down part of Highway 89 Sunday because of visibility issues, as the Schultz Fire was producing a huge plume of smoke that could be seen for miles. But by Monday morning, Neitzel told KPHO the cooperative overnight weather, including calmer winds, were making the smoke ""[lay] down ... so you don't see the big tower of smoke."" The Schultz Fire was the second large wildfire to break out in the Flagstaff area this weekend. The Hardy Fire started early Saturday afternoon. But the Hardy Fire is much smaller, at 300 acres, and firefighters have been able to contain 30 percent of it. The Flagstaff Fire Department initially had ordered evacuations of two neighborhoods and the Cococino Humane Society because of the Hardy Fire, but those evacuation orders have been rescinded, said the Coconino County website.","NEW:  10,000 acres burned in northern Arizona .

"(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama must speak out and declare that some of the behavior of the clerical regime in Iran is unacceptable, former Obama administration official Ray Takeyh said Monday. Takeyh, who served as an adviser in the State Department last year and is now at the Council on Foreign Relations, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour the U.S. must also be open to negotiating some sort of deal to limit Iran's nuclear ambitions. ""You can have negotiations with Iran, as the United States has had negotiations with many adversarial countries while also at the same time disapproving on the internal practices of those regimes,"" he said. Takeyh's comments came just over a week after the bloodiest clashes between pro-democracy protesters and government security forces in months, clashes that left at least eight people dead. Days after those clashes, hundreds of thousands of pro-government demonstrators held rallies in Tehran and other cities. Those protests coincided with new tensions over Iran's nuclear program, a program the United States says is intended to build a nuclear weapon. Tehran insists its nuclear activities are for peaceful purposes alone and says it's up to the West to decide whether to accept Iran's proposals on further enriching its uranium. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Monday the United States remains open to the possibility of further negotiations with Tehran, despite Iran's refusal to make significant progress towards a deal before January 1 this year, as Obama has demanded. Clinton told reporters the U.S. is holding discussions with its partners and like-minded nations about possible new sanctions and other forms of pressure. Takeyh said he expects the United States and its allies will try to ratchet up economic pressure on Iran, targeting in particular the Revolutionary Guard and its business interests. ""So you will begin to see intensification of economic pressure on Iran in the hope that external pressure, combined with internal pressure, will cause Iran to adjust its behavior,"" he said. Takeyh added that he believes the Iranian government internally is rather weak and vulnerable and may seek some sort of agreement abroad at least to mitigate international pressure. But he said the opposition movement in Iran is also somewhat incoherent. ""It doesn't have a central nervous system. It doesn't even have an identifiable set of leaders or even a coherent ideology. It is a protest movement."" He said the longer the movement sustains itself, though, the more it will develop an ideology and a leadership. A leading critic of the pro-democracy protesters, Professor Mohammad Marandi of Tehran University, told Amanpour that opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi's position has been severely weakened by the December 27 protests in Iran. ""The opposition that protested on (the Shiite Muslim holy day of) Ashura made a very major tactical mistake by being very brutal towards the police and also by carrying out these protests on a day of public mourning,"" Marandi said. But one of the most fearless critics of Iran's regime, former Iranian Member of Parliament Fatemeh Haghighatjoo, rejected Marandi's assessment. She said everyone still supports Moussavi. ""The government is not able to arrest all the population in Iran"", she said. ""The people of Iran need fundamental change in the country and I am so optimistic that they will see this change in the country in the future.""","United States must speak out more on Iranian government's actions, ex-Obama adviser says .

"(CNN)  -- Deng Zhuoxiang scored the only goal of the match as China handed France a 1-0 defeat in Les Blues final match before the World Cup finals. Playing on the French island of Reunion for the first time in their history, Raymond Domenech's men controlled the game but fell victim to a swerving free kick from Deng in the 68th minute. France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris was deceived by the flight of Deng's strike with the new World Cup ball. Domenech, who will stand down as French coach after the finals, was not impressed by his side's performance against a team who did not make South Africa. ""I'm disappointed. Losing a match, even a friendly, even a World Cup preparation match, is never nice,"" he told AFP. ""Now we have to analyze the match. I'm disappointed, particularly for the players and the public. But the World Cup is not today. It starts on June 11."" France beat Costa Rica and tied with Tunisia in their other warm-up matches ahead of the finals. The 2006 runners-up to Italy travel to South Africa on Saturday and begin their  campaign in Group A against Uruguay on June 11. They will be hoping for a more convincing performance than they managed against the Chinese, with plenty of possession but few shots on target. Franck Ribery and Yoann Gourcuff had long-range shots saved while Williams Gallas had a backheel ruled out for offside and also headed narrowly wide. Franck Ribery was the biggest threat before being replaced on the hour while Thierry Henry and Abou Diaby came on as substitutes, but it was Deng who scored with his side's only shot on target in the game.

"(Mental Floss) -- In honor of Father's Day, let's take a look at some dads who gave famous people a giant gift: their names. You know Dale Earnhardt Sr. and Ken Griffey Sr., but here are some lesser-known seniors behind a slew of celebrity juniors. 1. Martin Luther King Sr. probably didn't know his name would become so famous when he changed it. The civil rights icon's father was born Michael King in 1899, but after he became a successful minister in the 1930s, he changed his name to Martin Luther King. When Dad changed his name to honor Martin Luther, so did his 5-year-old son Michael King Jr. Like his son, King Sr. was a tireless civil rights advocate; he even led the Atlanta branch of the NAACP. Mental Floss: 7 lost time capsules . 2. Harry Connick Sr. has been known to tickle the ivories and belt out a tune or two in New Orleans' nightclubs, but his main claim to fame is his legal prowess. From 1973 to 2003, Harry Connick Sr. served as the District Attorney of Orleans Parish, a tenure that earned him enshrinement in the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame. 3. William F. Buckley Sr. was a lawyer and prominent oil developer in Texas. Buckley was active in the oil business in Mexico during the early 20th century, and at one point in 1921 he even found himself expelled from the country as the result of his lobbying to ease restrictions on American ownership of oil wells. 4. Mel Kiper Sr. never heard an NFL team call his name on draft day. Instead, the father of the NFL's pre-eminent draft guru worked a vending machine route, sold real estate, and coached college and high school baseball until his death in 1988. A 1992 Sports Illustrated profile of his son noted that Mel Sr. played a key role in helping get Mel Kiper Enterprises off the ground by helping his son track down subscribers and advertisers for his early NFL draft newsletters. Mental Floss: 11 famous roommates from the world of sports . 5. Cuba Gooding Sr. may have an Oscar-winning son, but he knows a thing or two about showbiz himself. Cuba Sr. sang in the Motown group The Main Ingredient, including lead vocals on the band's hit songs ""Everybody Plays the Fool"" and ""Just Don't Want to Be Lonely."" 6. Freddie Prinze was born Frederick Karl Pruetzel, but he changed his name to Freddie Prinze when his comedy career started to take off. Freddie Prinze Jr. fans might know know that his dad was a pretty successful comic, who made appearances on ""The Tonight Show"" and ""The Jack Paar Show"". He's probably best remembered for co-starring in the NBC sitcom ""Chico and the Man"" for four seasons in the mid-1970s. 7. Al Gore Sr. set a pretty good example for his son when it came to politics. The future vice president's father served as the congressman for Tennessee's 4th district from 1939 until 1953. He then spent 18 years in the Senate. Given his son's famous concerns about the climate, it's surprising that Al Sr. worked as a lawyer for a petroleum company and later became chairman of Island Creek Coal Company following the end of his political career. Mental Floss: 22 great photos found in presidential libraries . 8. Sammy Davis Sr. had a lot in common with his candy man son. Sammy Sr. was a successful dancer and vaudeville entertainer along with his wife, Elvera Sanchez, during the 1920s. When the pair split up in 1929, Sammy Sr. took his son on the road as part of a new dance act, and the young future Rat Pack member spent the rest of his life in show business. Mental Floss: Original flavors of 9 popular candies . 9. Larry Mullen Sr. was surely proud of his son's success as the drummer for the up-and-coming band U2 during the early 1980s, but his boy's growing fame led to some sticky situations. The Irish revenue service apparently had trouble distinguishing the two men, so Dad kept getting hefty tax bills that were meant for his rock-star son. The drummer decided to clear up any confusion by permanently adding the 'Jr."" to his stage name. 10. Kurt Vonnegut Sr. didn't write much satirical science fiction, but he had a knack for designing buildings. As an architect working in Indiana during the mid-20th century, Vonnegut drew up plans for a number of Art Deco-inflected Indiana Bell offices and Hook's Drug Stores shops. 11. Robert Downey Sr. hasn't appeared in any blockbusters like Iron Man, but he's enjoyed a long career as an actor, writer, and filmmaker. In 1972 he wrote and directed the cult film ""Greaser's Palace"", and he had a small role in William Friedkin's 1985 neo-noir ""To Live and Die in L.A.""

"Boston, Massachusetts (CNN) -- An Alabama professor accused of gunning down her colleagues at a university last week faced criminal charges after an altercation at a Massachusetts restaurant nearly eight years ago, police said Wednesday. It was the latest incident to surface involving Amy Bishop, a biology professor who is charged with capital murder and three counts of attempted murder in the shootings at the University of Alabama in Huntsville last week. Police in Peabody, Massachusetts, were called to an International House of Pancakes restaurant on March 16, 2002, on a report of an assault, according to a report from the Peabody Police Department. Responding officers found a crying woman who was the alleged victim, the report said. The woman, identified in the report as Michelle Gjika, told police she and her two children had been seated for breakfast. ""Soon after another family with the defendant Amy Bishop was seated in a booth nearby,"" the report said. Gjika ""then asked the waitress for a booster seat for one of the children and the waitress brought one over. The defendant Amy Bishop then also asked the waitress for a booster seat but Amy was told by the waitress that there were no more booster seats. ""The defendant ... then became angry that [Gjika] had the last booster seat and made the comment, 'But we were here first,' "" the report said . She then became loud and abusive to the woman, the report said, shouting profanity at her and at one point saying, ""I am Dr. Amy Bishop."" Bishop was asked to stop using profanity, but continued to verbally abuse the woman, becoming so loud that she was heard throughout the restaurant, police said. The IHOP manager told police that Bishop was acting ""like a crazy person."" The manager asked Bishop to leave, and Bishop struck the other woman on the right side of her head in front of the woman's two children, the report said. After she left the restaurant, the manager wrote down the license plate number of her red 1988 Ford Taurus. Authorities interviewed the victim and witnesses and contacted Bishop, who said that Gjika had been the aggressor, but her account did not match what others said about the incident. Bishop was charged with assault and battery and disorderly conduct, police said. The Essex County district attorney recommended a year of probation and anger management classes, but Bishop instead admitted that there was sufficient evidence to prosecute her for disorderly conduct and assault and battery and agreed not to contact Gjika, according to court documents. She was put on unsupervised probation for six months, according to Steve O'Connell, a spokesman for the Essex County district attorney. Gjika did not return a call from CNN. Authorities previously have said Bishop, who is also known as Amy Bishop Anderson, fatally shot her brother in the family's Braintree, Massachusetts, home in 1986. The shooting was ruled accidental, but authorities said Tuesday that previously missing police records of the incident had been found. Probable cause existed in 1986 to charge Bishop with assault with a dangerous weapon, carrying a dangerous weapon and unlawful possession of ammunition, Norfolk County District Attorney William Keating said in a statement. However, the statute of limitations on those charges has expired, as well as on a potential charge of ""wanton and reckless conduct,"" the lowest standard for manslaughter in Massachusetts, he said. And in effect, the recovered documents do not contradict investigators' conclusion at the time that the shooting was an accident, according to the statement. In addition, The Boston Globe reported Monday that Bishop and her husband, Jim Anderson, were questioned in the 1993 attempted mail bombing of a Harvard Medical School professor. Jim Anderson told CNN on Monday that federal investigators had gathered ""a dozen subjects"" in the attempted bombing, but ""there were never any suspects. Never anyone charged, never anyone arrested. Then five years later, we got a letter from the ATF saying, 'You are in the clear.'

"(CNN)  -- NASA plans to launch next week the first of 17 planned flights to study changes in Antarctic ice and collect data that may help scientists better predict the consequences of those changes, officials said Thursday. Antarctica's Larsen Ice Shelf, viewed from NASA's DC-8 aircraft in 2004, is one target of the 2009 operation. The first flight over the Antarctic is planned to take off October 15 from Punta Arenas, Chile, according to a NASA statement and scientists involved in the project. The flights are part of ""Operation Ice Bridge,"" a six-year plan described as the largest ever airborne survey of ice at Earth's poles. ""We have operated in Antarctica a few times previously ... but these surveys barely scratched the surface,"" William Krabill of NASA's Wallops Flight Facility told reporters on a conference call Thursday. The flights will be conducted by a DC-8 outfitted as a special airborne laboratory with laser mapping instruments, ice-penetrating radar and gravity instruments. The flights will be able to gather information that a satellite cannot. ""The problem with satellites is, we can't see through the ice sheet with satellites,"" said Robin Bell, a scientist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory who also is involved in the project. She said the technology carried on the plane will provide researchers a chance to address questions regarding why the ice sheet is changing. ""We really want to know how much water is under the ice sheet,"" she said. The technology will allow scientists to detect that water and see how much is present under the ice. That information, according to the NASA statement, can help predict how changes in the ice sheet will contribute to a potential global rise in sea levels. But officials said the flights also will serve as a partial replacement for one satellite: NASA's Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite, known as ICESat. The current ICESat has been in orbit since 2003 and is nearing the end of its lifetime. The next satellite, ICESat-II, is scheduled to launch in 2014 at the earliest. Without the flight measurements, ""we would be blind"" to changes in the ice sheet, said the mission leader, Seelye Martin of the University of Washington in Seattle. He also was on Thursday's call. In the NASA statement, Tom Wagner, cryosphere program manager at NASA headquarters, said, ""A remarkable change is happening on Earth, truly one of the biggest changes in environmental conditions since the end of the ice age. It's not an easy thing to observe, let alone predict what might happen next. Studies like 'Ice Bridge' are key."" ""Cryosphere"" refers to the regions of the Earth's surface where ice predominates. Because flights cannot cover the entire Antarctic continent, scientists have selected key sites to study that are most prone to change, NASA said. ""Sea ice measurements will be collected from the Amundsen Sea, where local warming suggests the ice may be thinning,"" the statement said. ""Ice sheet and glacier studies will be flown over the Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica, including Pine Island Glacier, an area scientists believe could undergo rapid changes.""","First flight over Antarctic scheduled to take off October 15 from Punta Arenas, Chile .

"MacDill Air Force Base, Florida (CNN) -- The names of two people who tried Monday to enter MacDill Air Force Base with unauthorized weapons were released by officials Tuesday. The individuals were identified as Army Spc. Christopher Paul Kilburn based at Fort Riley, Kansas, and civilian Micah Noel Goodier of Palm Beach, Florida. Kilburn, who was on AWOL status from the Army, has been charged with desertion, a release from the air base said. He is being turned over to Army authorities, and additional charges are pending, the air base said. Potential charges against Goodier will be determined by the U.S. Attorney's Office, the air base said. Earlier, officials said a man and a woman tried to enter the base using fraudulent identifications, Vice Commander Col. David Cohen said at a news conference Tuesday. All gates at the base reopened Tuesday. They were temporarily closed after the heavily armed man and woman were taken into custody after trying to enter the facility without authorization. The pair were stopped early Monday evening at a gate at the base, which houses the headquarters for U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, Senior Airman Katherine Holt said. A search of the vehicle after they were detained revealed three handguns and three ""rifle-style"" weapons, Cohen said. The investigation was ongoing, he said. The incident was not being investigated as a terrorist threat, Cohen said. Authorities cordoned off the pair's sport-utility vehicle and searched it using a robot, but no explosives were found. Video showed base personnel removing weapons, ammunition and military-style clothing from the vehicle, which was later towed away. The Tampa, Florida, installation houses the headquarters of U.S. Central Command, which runs the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as the U.S. Special Operations Command.

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- There was stone cold silence in the car, as the Kumars drove home. Salwan Montessori School in New Delhi received 2,500 applications -- for 150 spots -- for the 2009 school year. The married couple had stopped speaking out of sheer frustration and disappointment. They had been rejected for the 10th time. Their three-year-old daughter, Janhavi, would not be attending any of the nursery schools to which they had applied. ""There's been a ban on children interviews,"" said the girl's mother, Geeta Kumar. ""But the schools being very smart, acting very smart they want to meet parents informally, informal interaction they are calling and they are scoring on us."" ""We are being tested,"" Puneet Kumar, Janhavi's father, interrupted. ""Yeah we're being tested for our child's admission."" Geeta added. ""It's the worst thing we've been through,"" Puneet said with a sigh. It may sound over dramatic but it is a sentiment held by many parents who suffer through sleepless nights, endless anxiety, and are sometimes reduced to tears, as they try to get their children admitted to nursery schools with good reputations. At one of these schools, the headmistress has seen more than her share of desperation. ""I've never seen a man crying, until now,"" said Anuadha Mathur, the headmistress of Salwan Montessori School.  Watch a visit to one of New Delhi's most exclusive nursery schools » . ""But when a parent comes and he's literally begging and saying, 'Ma'am where do I take my child,' and he's got tears in his eyes, he's shivering. Believe me, it's heartbreaking."" ""The thing is, everybody wants their child to be in the best school,"" Geeta Kumar said. ""And there are very few."" The problem is particularly acute in the capital of New Delhi, where getting your child admitted to any one of the top 10 sought-after nursery schools is harder than it would be for a college-aged student to gain admission to Ivy League schools in the United States, such as Harvard or Yale. Why? In India it is almost always about the numbers. There are a billion people in this country, and more and more of them are moving into urban areas trying to make a living -- which translates into more students trying to get a seat in schools that already have long waiting lists. Take, for example, Salwan Montessori School in New Delhi. They received 2,500 applications -- for 150 spots -- for the 2009 school year. Only 6 percent of those who applied got in, and Salwan is not the most sought-after school. Some schools have places for less than 4 percent of applicants. Compare that to the Harvard University class of 2009: . Of the 22,796 students who applied, 2,074 got in for a 9.1 percent admission rate. You might be wondering why nursery school admission is so important since the child will have a lot of schooling to go through before thinking about university. The answer: Many students spend 14 years in one school, so where they go to nursery school determines the next 14 years of their education. What kind of education does one of these sought after schools offer? At Salwan Montessori, the children learn public speaking, music, several sports, and social skills along with their basic education. It is just the kind of thing parents are looking for because they know education is key to their child's chance at a better life. But there are other institutions that are not so cramped: Government schools. Just the mention of it sent shivers down the Kumars' spines. ""The grooming would not be good, the child won't grow, the mind won't grow,"" Geeta Kumar said with a deep frown, her husband itching to chime in. ""Nearest school to my place is a government school, but the infrastructure is very bad,"" Puneet Kumar added. Parents complain some of the government schools are falling apart. The toilets are broken, there is no running water, and teachers sometimes simply fail to show up for class. The fight for good education is fierce. But Salwan Montessori Headmistress Mathur said parents need to realize that just because they do not get the school of their choice does not mean their child will be unsuccessful. She also noted that not all government schools were unfit. For the meantime, the Kumars are still tied in knots. Their daughter Janhavi was forced to go to a lesser known private school in their neighborhood. Now four years old, Janhavi seems oblivious to it all. She is a smart little girl. Before even showing up at school she could speak Hindi, some English and Japanese. As she sits on her bed counting to 10 in Japanese, her parents are counting the months before the next admission process starts. They are planning on going through the process all over again next year. ""Obviously,"" Geeta Kumar said. ""You aim for the best.""","More Indians moving to urban areas, hence longer waiting lists for nursery schools .
Some schools have places for less than 4 percent of applicants .

"(CNN) -- Poland's presidential election produced no clear winner Sunday, preliminary exit polls showed. The leading candidate, interim President Bronislaw Komorowski, failed to garner more than 50 percent of the vote, which would have clinched victory in the first round of voting to replace President Lech Kaczynski, who was killed in a plane crash in April. The election pitted Komorowski, the parliament speaker who has been acting president since the crash, against Kaczynski's twin brother, Jaroslaw Kaczynski. According to exit polls, Komorowski had 45.7 percent of the vote to Kaczynski's 33.2 percent. If those polls are accurate, a second round of voting will be needed to decide the winner. That election would likely take place July 4. The two were among 10 candidates in the election originally planned for the autumn but brought forward after Kaczynski died. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, once prime minister, is a divisive figure in Polish politics. His far-right Law and Justice party runs on a nationalist platform with the slogan, ""Poland comes first."" ""Poland has to be a strong country, otherwise it will not exist,"" he said recently. ""I want to tell everyone here that as president I won't just be the head of state -- I will look after the strength of the Polish nation."" Komorowski is a moderate running for the center-right Civic Platform. ""We have been on this road for 21 years together and we have been right,"" Komorowski said on the campaign trail. ""We have been moving toward democracy and navigating our way in a free economy."" The tragic death of the president and recent fatal floods in southern Poland -- which left at least 20 people dead and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage -- have meant a tame presidential campaign. Political analyst Radoslaw Markowski described the race as ""less aggressive"" and said the candidates have avoided straightforward debate. Though the president in Poland is primarily a ceremonial figure, he has the power to veto laws, thus helping to shape politics. The president, his wife and more than 90 others were killed in western Russia on their way to the 70th anniversary of the Russian massacre of Polish prisoners of war in the village of Katyn.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Hundreds of protesters from the Gaza Strip and Israel converged on both sides of the main border crossing Thursday in an organized rally to call for the end of the economic blockade of Gaza maintained by Israel and Egypt. In Gaza, approximately 100 international activists were joined by several hundred Palestinians in a march to the border, while some 300 Israeli, international and Palestinian activists demonstrated on the Israeli side of the border. Carrying Palestinian flags and signs calling for an end to ""the Gaza siege"" and ""Israeli aggression,"" rally participants said they were trying to draw attention to the plight of Palestinians in Gaza. On the Israel side, Knesset member and United Arab Party Chairman Ibrahim Sarsour called the continued blockade of Gaza ""an ongoing tragedy for the Palestinian people"" and called for it to be lifted to give people ""a chance to live in dignity."" Among the international protesters in Gaza were three orthodox rabbis from the Neturei Karta movement, a small anti-Zionist Jewish sect that does not believe in the state of Israel. Rabbi Dovid Feldman told a crowd that he was ""humiliated by what is being done in our name"" and that Israel is ""simply using the name of Zionism to perpetrate a crime."" The Islamist group Hamas violently took over Gaza in 2007. Since then, the coastal strip of 1.5 million people has been subject to a punishing economic embargo by Israel and Egypt, which has greatly limited goods coming in and out and increased poverty in the war-torn territory. Israel, the United States and the European Union consider Hamas a terrorist organization. Thursday's march coincides with the first anniversary of Israel's 23-day offensive against Hamas, launched in an attempt to stop militant rocket fire into southern Israel. The offensive, called Operation Cast Lead, resulted in the deaths of more than 1,000 Palestinians and 13 Israelis. Dubbed the Gaza Freedom March, Thursday's event attracted the participation of about 1,400 international activists. Organizers said they planned to enter Gaza through Egypt, but only 100 of them were ultimately given permission to enter by the Egyptian government. Some of those who stayed behind in Egypt participated in a Thursday rally in downtown Cairo, according to organizers. In the southern Israeli town of Sderot, a frequent target of militant rocket fire from Gaza, Israelis marked the Gaza war anniversary with a release of balloons with ""messages of hope"" from Israeli children to children of Gaza, organizers said. ""I think that the powerful message carried from children is sometimes better than the cunning negotiations for this or that Palestinian negotiator,"" said Yuli Edelstein, Israel's minister for public diplomacy.

"(CNN) -- The federal government's response manager to the Gulf oil disaster said Sunday that BP has made progress, but cautioned it was too early to call the effort a success. ""We're making the right progress. I don't think anyone should be pleased as long as there's oil in the water,"" Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday. Allen was responding to remarks over the weekend by BP's senior vice president, Bob Fryar, who said the company was ""pleased"" with its operation to funnel crude up from the ruptured undersea well to a drilling ship a mile above on the Gulf of Mexico. Fryar said the company funneled about 250,000 gallons of oil in the first 24 hours from a containment cap, installed on the well, to a drilling ship on the ocean surface. On Saturday, BP had increased the amount of oil it was funneling to about 441,000 gallons to the surface. Federal authorities estimate that 798,000 gallons of crude are gushing into the sea every day. Allen confirmed that BP has been able to bring oil to the surface after placing the cap, but said no one should be pleased until a relief well is completed and the leaking stops. ""This is an insidious enemy,"" Allen said. ""It's attacking all of our shores, it's holding the Gulf hostage, basically."" In an apperance on ABC's ""This Week,"" Allen described the current state of the spill as a series of pools, ranging from 20-100 yards to several miles in length. ""The spill has disaggregated over a 200-mile radius around the wellbore. It's not a monolithic spill. It is literally hundreds and thousands of smaller spills,"" he said. Even as the administration has tried to distance itself from BP in recent days, with the Justice Department launching both criminal and civil investigations into the spill, it has not been enough to temper the frustration seething among residents along the coastline. Florida Sen. George LeMieux, a Republican, demanded that BP donate $1 billion for a cleanup fund for the five Gulf states and said that President Obama ""needs to push them to do that."" ""I want to see this president more engaged here on the ground, working through problems,"" LeMieux said. On ""State of the Union,"" Florida Gov. Charlie Crist said his state was ""as ready as we can be,"" as the currents moved the oil eastward. In addition to a declaration of a state of disaster, Florida has about 250,000 feet of boom spread around the Panhandle and has another 250,000 feet available, Crist said. Florida is also pushing BP to respond to claims made by business owners who are losing business and facing an economic crisis because of the spill. ""In the short term, we want these claims to be responded to more quickly,"" Crist said. ""These people need help, and we need to be there to try to make them as whole as we can during this very difficult process."" Tony Kennon, the mayor of Orange Beach, Alabama, confronted Fryar at the Saturday news conference for not acting promptly when reports surfaced that tar balls were washing ashore. Visibly upset, Kennon said local officials had been asking to meet with BP officials for over a month, but their requests went unanswered. ""If you sensed our frustration, you would have been here a lot sooner,"" Kennon told Fryar. ""People in Orange Beach are starving to death now because they can't get out to catch the fish."" Allen said the Alabama incident the mayor referred to was the result of a mechanical failure where a boom became disconnected before a skimmer arrived to prevent the oil from reaching the shore. Overall, however, Allen said the federal government is in charge of making sure BP is carrying out its cleanup responsibilities. In an effort to respond faster, Coast Guard field commanders don't need approval to get cleanup equipment out, Allen said. ""If there's oil out there, they need to call in skimming equipment,"" he said. ""We don't want them to go two or three levels up to higher authority to be able to do that. I've given direct orders to all my field commanders out there that when they see oil and they have the capability to respond and they're to do it."" Not all the Gulf states were suffering the effects of the spill equally. In Mississippi, barely any oil had appeared on the shores, but the state's tourist industry was nonetheless feeling the pinch. ""The truth is we've had virtually no oil,"" Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour told ""Fox News Sunday."" ""If you were on the Mississippi Gulf Coast anytime in the last 48 days, you didn't see any oil at all."" The biggest effect the state has felt, Barbour said, resulted from media reports saying that the entire Gulf Coast was affected. Mississippi's ""tourist season has been hurt by misperceptions of what's going on down here,"" he said. On Saturday, Allen told reporters that BP planned to shut down valves in the cap -- which are allowing oil to escape -- once the pressure is eased. The ultimate capacity of the operation is 630,000 captured gallons a day, still shy of the amount spewing. Earlier, coastal residents had anxiously awaited news of BP's progress as elevated southerly winds pushed the perimeter of the spilled oil closer to shorelines as far east as the Florida Panhandle.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicted that scattered tar balls and light sheen would impact beaches as far east as Bay County, home to popular destinations in Panama City. Florida beaches remained open Saturday, but the number of beachgoers was down. The sun and surf were interrupted by sticky brown globs of oil washing up on the sugary sand and workers with blue rubber gloves and plastic bags trying to keep the beach clean. Earlier, Crist walked the beach accompanied by ""Margaritaville"" singer Jimmy Buffett, who is building a hotel on the Pensacola shoreline. ""I saw some tar balls,"" Crist said. ""It's terrible when you see something like that. It breaks your heart."" The oil spill has already threatened ecologically sensitive lands along the Gulf Coast. Images of oil-drenched pelicans were all over the Internet, prompting even more public anger toward BP. Obama sought in his weekly address Saturday to ease fear along the Gulf Coast by reaffirming his commitment to clean up the worst oil spill in U.S. history. ""It's brutally unfair. It's wrong,"" Obama said in the address, recorded a day earlier in Grand Isle, Louisiana. ""And what I told these men and women -- and what I have said since the beginning of this disaster -- is that I'm going to stand with the people of the Gulf Coast until they are made whole."" It appeared that BP was making progress after capping the breached wellhead, Obama said, but he said that the federal government was ""prepared for the worst."" He cited a series of statistics that illustrated the ""largest response to an environmental disaster of this kind in the history of our country"": . • 17,500 National Guard troops authorized for deployment; . • 20,000 people currently working to protect waters and coastlines; . • 1,900 vessels in the Gulf assisting in the cleanup; . • 4.3 million feet of boom deployed with another 2.9 million feet of boom available, enough to stretch over 1,300 miles; . • 17 staging areas across Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida to rapidly defend sensitive shorelines. Meanwhile, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued a sliver of good news Saturday. After reviewing images and data, the agency reopened more than 13,000 square miles of the Gulf -- just west of the Florida Keys and Dry Tortugas -- for fishing. But at the same time, it closed a 2,275-square mile area off the Florida Panhandle, extending the northern boundary just east of the western edge of Choctawhatchee Bay, which means 32 percent of the Gulf still remains off-limits for fishing. The BP well erupted after an explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on April 20. The BP-leased rig sank two days later, leaving up to 19,000 barrels (798,000 gallons) of oil pouring into the Gulf daily, according to federal estimates.","NEW: Mississippi seeing no oil on beaches, but tourists are staying away, governor says .

"New York (CNN)  -- Renée Fleming's new album ""Dark Hope"" has found the light, having earned the operatic soprano a spot on the Billboard Top 200 chart for the first time. While debuting at No. 151 might not put her up there with Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga, a place on the pop charts is a feat for any artist whose album success has mostly been measured on the classical chart (which Fleming has topped five times). The new territory could be attributed to Fleming's radical departure from diva to rocker. On the album she trades velvet gowns and soaring arias for freshly cut bangs and covers of songs like indie-rock band Muse's ""Endlessly"" and Death Cab for Cutie's ""Soul Meets Body."" And why not? ""I've devoted my life to classical music,"" says Fleming, 51. ""It's my passion in life and where I've put all of my effort for decades. But I've always listened to other things and enjoyed other things."" With the exception of Peter Gabriel's ""In Your Eyes"" and Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah,"" Fleming wasn't familiar with any of the songs she interprets on ""Dark Hope"" (Decca). They were introduced to her by Metallica and the Red Hot Chili Peppers managers Cliff Burnstein and Peter Mensch. After listening to the compilation of indie and pop songs they felt would suit her rich, lower register, Fleming was intrigued. ""I was absolutely delighted to see how much talent exists in this world. [The music is] so quirky and eccentric and edgy and sophisticated. Then there's the spirit of it: the passion, the anger, the sense of social consciousness."" And while eyebrows have risen over one of America's most beloved sopranos stepping into rock 'n' roll turf, Fleming points out that cross-genre admiration is a two-way street: Muse frontman Matt Belamy recently attended one of Fleming's performances in Rossini's ""Armida"" at The Metropolitan Opera in New York. Rock image aside, recording ""Dark Hope"" was a family affair for Fleming. Her teenage daughters, who were at first appalled to learn their mother was going to take on the likes of Arcade Fire and Duffy (""They said ... 'Mom, there's no way!' "") warmed to the project when Fleming invited them to sing backup on some of the songs. Fleming's sister Rachelle also joined in. In fact you can see the whole family in the ""Endlessly"" music video. ""We had a wonderful time together,"" says Fleming. ""It was so great. They have great taste -- eclectic taste -- in music.""","Renée Fleming's new album ""Dark Hope"" debuted at No. 151 .

"(CNN) -- Singer Enrique Iglesias moved to the United States as a child but his football heart remains in Spain. As Spain prepares to play Honduras on Monday -- after losing to Switzerland in the first group game -- he talks to CNN about his heroes, football memories and fitting in games while doing promotion work. Did you play football as a kid? Yes, I used to play right wing when I was a kid. I don't play any more. I probably could not play for more than five minutes, I'd be in the ground. I've got no endurance whatsoever. Maybe after a tour but not before one. As a kid I played in Spain til I was 8. I was medium, not great but not bad. Then I moved to the U.S. -- 20 years ago soccer was not as big in the U.S. as it is now -- and I was actually pretty good in comparison to the rest of the players at the time. It felt good. The coach would always put me in to play. The best memories were of scoring goals. When you score you felt like you were on top of the world. My favorite player back then was Diego Maradona. The second goal he scored against England [in 1986 World Cup) was so, so magnificent. It made the rest of the world -- maybe not England -- forget the handball goal and say ""OK, you deserved to win."" Who are your favorite players at this World Cup? Between Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. And Iniesta and Torres and Fabregas and Villa and Casillas. What does the World Cup mean to you? My album ""Euphoria"" comes out in July and that means I am promoting it in all June and July. I was so disappointed. That was the only thing I hated about this album to the point that three weeks ago I called the president of the record company and told him that I wanted to delay my album and move it to September due to the World Cup. I was keen on it. I'm like ""please, please, please,"" I begged and they said ""if you move it to September just to watch the World Cup we will never speak to you again."" I was disappointed. I was ""come on, it is once every four years"" and they were ""come on, your albums are once every three years."" Will Iglesias have a summer hit? The World Cup is the only time my career comes second. It's crucial to me. When Spain plays they did promise me they would clear my schedule. How do you think Spain will do? The worst part was I was in London for the Swiss game and they cleared the schedule for two hours and I got to watch Spain and I got to see them lose. After that I didn't want to do more interviews. It was one of those games that you watch and you say how could we have lost? You can tell their skill and they were the better team but at the end of the day it's 'you can't forgive in football,' you have to go for it. It's not always the better team that wins and what matters is the final score. It was just devastating. If there's one World Cup where you would think this is the time where they have a chance, I would think it's this one. Ever since I was a little kid Spain was always good, always promised a lot but they never quite get there. CNN.com tracks the World Cup . This time, since the Euros (European championships), things have changed. From Iniesta to Alonso to Torres to Villa to Piquet to Puyol, you have Fabregas, you have Casillas. You just have such a complete team, and they are so talented and each player is so good. But now there's a lot of pressure. They have to win. If Brazil wins their group and if Spain qualifies second they have to play Brazil. I would rather Spain wins the group and plays Portugal or Ivory Coast. Who do you think will do well? I think Argentina will go all the way or close. I got to watch a bit of the South Korea game and they were really good. Obviously, Brazil. It will boil down to those teams -- to Argentina, to Brazil, Italy always starts bad and ends up in a good place, Germany will be there. And hopefully Spain will be in there. It's so difficult to tell in the World Cup because anything can happen. What are your best and worst memories of football? Worst was the 2002 (World Cup). Spain-South Korea. They got robbed. I think the referee made major mistakes to the point that it was so so obvious it almost made you think something was going on. It was too, too obvious. The best, when I was 5 years old, the World Cup in Spain in '82, the mascot was Naranjito. The Italy-Germany game, I was there. I watched it. I remember Paolo Rossi. He was my idol in that World Cup.","Schedule cleared to watch Spain's World Cup games .

"Okaloosa Island, Florida (CNN) -- If you could have painted the day, it would have been a Monet. A white sandy beach, blue sky and a green ocean that you may have only seen in dreams. Florida's Emerald Coast, on a Sunday. The only thing out of place were the BP contractors in green shirts and yellow rubber boots, with shovels, rakes and of course, the oil. ""I think it's fantastic that they have a community of people out here trying to clean up,"" said Matt Minardi of Athens, Georgia. ""If I see anything out there that concerns us, we may rethink that, but so far it looks good,"" he told CNN. Full coverage of oil disaster . Matt Minardi and his family came from Athens for the beach, not the tar balls. They're getting a lot of the beach, and fortunately, only a few tar balls. Just feet from their umbrella, beach cleanup workers were busy scooping up the pea-sized oil fragments that seem to come in and out with the tide on a semi-regular basis, all along Florida's Panhandle from Pensacola in the west to Panama City in the east. ""We're going to keep an eye on the weather. Where the oil is, where it came in from,"" said Okaloosa County Commissioner John Jannazo. ""And we're cleaning up. We had some oil ... and we picked it up, just like that,"" he said. Most of the oil is in very small amounts of weathered oil. It's small and scattered. Florida has not seen or felt the pain that comes with the arrival of thick, black crude on the shoreline. Is there oil on the beach near you? ""It definitely takes a little away from it, but we're here and we're going to try and enjoy ourselves,"" said Mike Werkmeister of St. Louis. ""We didn't feel like trying to arrange something else, and we also felt like we should come down and support this community, too, cause they definitely are feeling the effects of this,"" he said. Those effects are hitting the Panhandle right smack in the wallet. Tourism is down about 30 to 40 percent, according to state tourism officials. More and more cancellations are coming in each day, throughout the state, where 80 million visitors brought in $60 billion dollars in 2009. Florida county to feds: Stay out of the way . ""If you say oil or tar ball to a tourist, they mentally see Louisiana,"" said Carol Dover of the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association, referring to the thick molasses-like oil that has soaked Louisiana's wetlands. That's why local officials are quick to get the cleanup crews to those limited places where the weathered crude has come ashore. ""It's an ongoing fight. We're anticipating continuing to find and fight oil in places it rises to the surface, for the foreseeable future,"" said Lt. Matthew Anderson of the U.S. Coast Guard. ""Our operations are deployed to support this on a wartime footing,"" he told CNN. But on Crab Island, the only thing on people's minds was enjoying a day on the water, while they still can. Boaters flock to this sandbar in the Destin Pass, to hang out and listen to the floating band. And, while they weren't overly distracted by oil, the thought of BP CEO Tony Hayward on his yacht this past weekend raised the blood pressure of some and was a bit of a head scratcher for others. Tony Hayward goes yachting . ""He's probably in some really clean water. No oil. So, he's not trying to stop the oil leak,"" said one man. Johnny Springfield has lived here for 20 years. He says his boating business is down 60 to 70 percent, but his anger is a little on the high side. ""You kind of have to look at that two ways,"" he explained. ""One. He was relaxing and he was out on his boat, and we hate that. But on the good side of things, he wasn't down here runnin' his mouth.""","Florida's Emerald Coast on a Sunday is picture perfect -- blue skies, green water .

"(Mashable) -- As a part of the 25th anniversary of Toshiba's laptop business, the company unveiled a dual-screen laptop concept named the Libretto W100. Although Toshiba calls it a concept PC, it looks very finished and ready for market release, which Toshiba claims will be later this summer, albeit in a limited capacity (the price is reported to be $1099). As far as specifications go, one thing definitely stands out: dual 7.0-inch multi-touch displays with 1024×600 pixel resolution, together with a virtual keyboard with haptic response. It's powered by an Intel Pentium U5400 CPU operating at 1.2 GHz, 2 GB of DDR3 memory, and a 64 GB SSD, which makes it a fairly powerful machine. Other specs include a 1-megapixel webcam, Bluetooth, MicroSD card, Wi-Fi, one USB port, an 8-cell battery, while the operating system is Windows 7. It's also a very portable device, measuring merely 4.84 inches by 7.95 inches when closed, and weighing 1.8lbs. See Scobleizer's ""first look"" video of the Libretto W100 here. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"New York (CNN) -- Faisal Shahzad, the 30-year-old Pakistani-American suspect in the failed Times Square bombing case, entered pleas of guilty Monday in federal court to all 10 counts he was facing. Shahzad, wearing a white skullcap, gray prison jumpsuit and orange T-shirt, was wearing handcuffs as he was escorted into the courtroom of U.S. District Judge Miriam Cedarbaum. Before entering his pleas, he told the court: ""I want to plead guilty 100 times because unless the United States pulls out of Afghanistan and Iraq, until they stop drone strikes in Somalia, Pakistan and Yemen and stop attacking Muslim lands, we will attack the United States and be out to get them."" Cedarbaum then placed Shahzad under oath and asked him questions about the crime. A law enforcement source told CNN the decision to plead guilty was Shahzad's. Shahzad is accused of attempting to set off the botched vehicle bomb in Times Square on May 1. He was arrested two days later while trying to leave the country on a flight from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. Shahzad said he traveled to Waziristan in Pakistan on December 9 with two friends to join the Taliban. He said that during the five days he was there, the Taliban gave him $4,000, which he combined with $4,900 of his own money to pay for the materials used in the attack. In a news release, the Justice Department said Shahzad received explosives training from Tehrik-e-Taliban, a militant extremist group in Pakistan. In February, it said, he received approximately $5,000 in cash in Massachusetts sent from a co-conspirator in Pakistan who Shahzad believed worked for Tehrik-e-Taliban and he received $7,000 more in Ronkonkoma, New York, which was also sent at the co-conspirator's direction. ""Once I got back to the states, I started working on the plan,"" he said. ""Getting together what I needed for the bomb. I rented a place in Bridgeport, Connecticut. That is where I built the bomb, put it in the Pathfinder and drove it to Times Square."" On May 1, he said, he drove the vehicle into Times Square and ignited the 2.5- to 5-minute fuses, ""and then I left the car."" The bomb, he said, was in three pieces. ""I consider myself a mujahedeen and a Muslim soldier,"" he said. Asked by Cedarbaum whether he understood that children and other innocents might have been among his victims, Shahzad was unapologetic. ""They don't see the drones killing children in Afghanistan,"" he said. ""It's a war and I'm a part of it."" Asked whether he understood that his actions represented a crime, he said, ""I would not consider it a crime. ... I'm aware it's a crime in the United States, but I don't care about the law of the United States."" A source familiar with the case told CNN that prosecutors will ask for the maximum sentence on the charges during sentencing, which is scheduled for October 5. The source said there was no plea deal and no cooperation deal. That means that, despite the fact that Shahzad cooperated with prosecutors for two weeks after his arrest, they will not request any preferential treatment for him. Of the 10 charges, six carry a maximum sentence of life: attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction, possession of a firearm in relation to conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction, attempted act of terrorism transcending national boundaries, conspiracy to commit an act of terrorism, and attempted use of a destructive device in relation to conspiracy to commit an act of terrorism. Because Shahzad pleaded guilty to Count 3, Count 6 carries a mandatory minimum penalty of life in prison. Counts 7 and 8 -- transportation of an explosive and conspiracy to transport an explosive -- each carry a maximum sentence of 10 years. Counts 9 and 10 -- attempted destruction of property by fire and explosives and conspiracy to destroy property by fire and explosives -- each carries a maximum sentence of 20 years. Shahzad's arrest heightened concerns about the Pakistani Taliban, who authorities believe directed the Times Square plot. U.S. intelligence officials fear that the Taliban are plotting to strike within the United States and are targeting American interests overseas. CNN's Julian Cummings, Allan Chernoff, Jeanne Meserve and John King contributed to this report.","Shahzad pleads guilty to all 10 counts .

"(CNN) -- A woman was formally charged Monday with the 2008 killing of an aspiring actress and model, California authorities said.

A second suspect, Ronnie Wayne Case, 34, who had been arrested in connection with the case, was released, the Santa Monica police department told CNN. In an earlier media statement, the Santa Monica police said both Case and Park had been ""charged with murder with special circumstances and conspiracy."" There was no elaboration on what led to Case's release. The victim, Juliana Redding, 21, had moved from Arizona to Los Angeles to pursue the Hollywood dream.

"(CNN)  -- France's tumultuous World Cup campaign ended in dismal fashion on Tuesday as the former world champions were beaten 2-1 by hosts South Africa in their final group game in Bloemfontein. Both South African goals came in the first half while French midfielder Yoann Gourcuff was sent off following a clash with MacBeth Sibaya to deal another early blow to France's slim hopes. France's nightmare ends but South Africa fall short . French preparations for the match had been overshadowed by an apparent collapse in relations between coach Raymond Domenech and his players, with captain Patrice Evra left out of the side after apparently clashing with Domenech and other coaching staff and officials. South Africa's win was not enough to prevent them becoming the first World Cup host nation to be eliminated before the tournament's knockout stages, with Mexico advancing alongside group winners Uruguay despite losing 1-0 to the South Americans. But the real misery was for French fans who saw their team -- traditionally among the strongest national sides in world football -- become one of the first to be eliminated from the World Cup amid turbulent infighting and allegations of treachery. The 10 biggest World Cup upsets . Striker Nicolas Anelka was sent home after confronting Domenech at halftime during France's 2-0 defeat by Mexico last week. Evra was then involved in a public training ground dispute with the squad's fitness coach on Sunday and is reported to have led dissent over Anelka's expulsion from the squad, with the entire squad boycotting the training session. Adding to the confusion, French team director Jean-Louis Valentin then publicly announced his resignation to the media, while French sports minister Roselyne Bachelot has been in France attempting to mediate between Domenech and his players. But on Monday night Bachelot told journalists the French players had ""tarnished the image of France,"" according to French sports newspaper L'Equipe. In an indication of the extent to which relations had broken down between Domenech and his squad, the coach on Monday described this players' decision to strike as ""unspeakably stupid,"" and called their actions ""an aberration and an imbecility."" Pedro Pinto: Heads should roll for French farce . ""Nobody can behave in such a way in the dressing room or elsewhere and high-level sportsmen and women have to lead by example through football,"" Domenech told reporters. ""We tried to convince the players that what was happening was irregular, that their actions were unspeakably stupid. I told myself this masquerade had to be stopped. No way would I back this action."" CNN Senior International Correspondent Jim Bittermann in Paris said French fans, pundits and politicians were attempting to outdo each other in their criticism of the French squad. ""One of the words we've heard is divas to describe the team and chaos to describe the situation,"" said Bittermann. ""It's the image of the French society now, it's a bad example for the youth -- terrible,"" one Parisian woman told CNN. ""They're paid players. Whatever happened in their team it's not the right time to go on strike,"" said another. France's problems at the World Cup had exacerbated long-standing dissatisfaction with the controversial Domenech, who is due to step down as national coach after the tournament to make way for former World Cup-winning defender Laurent Blanc. France won the World Cup on home soil in 1998 and reached the final under Domenech four years ago in Germany, losing on penalties to Italy after star player Zinedine Zidane was sent off for head butting Italian defender Marco Materazzi. But France has struggled to replace the Zidane generation, which also won the European Championship in 2000. They only qualified for South Africa by virtue of a tight playoff win over Ireland, sealed with the help of Thierry Henry's handballed assist for William Gallas' goal. Exit at the group stage in South Africa marks their second successive failure in the opening stages of a major tournament after they crashed out of Euro 2008 without winning a match.","France beaten 2-1 by hosts South Africa in Bloemfontein .

"Ithaca, New York (CNN) -- According to a recent report by the Pew Research Center, one of every seven new marriages in 2008 was interracial or interethnic -- the highest percentage in U.S. history. The media and blogosphere have been atwitter. Finally, it seems, we have tangible evidence of America's entry into a new post-racial society, proof of growing racial tolerance. Intermarriage trends are being celebrated as a positive sign that we have come to think of all Americans as, well, Americans. But others have an entirely different take -- a more ominous one. They see increasing interracial marriage rates as proof that the country is amalgamating racially. To them, intermarriage is a putative threat to whites and America's essential character. Their concerns are heightened by recent Census Bureau projections that the U.S. will become a majority-minority society by the middle of the century. My research with Ken Johnson, a demographer at the University of New Hampshire, indicates that for American's youngest residents, that future is now. Nearly half of U.S. births today are to minority women. It's time for everyone -- on all sides of this issue -- to relax and take a deep breath. The reality is that racial boundaries remain firmly entrenched in American society. They are not likely to go away anytime soon. We are still far from a melting pot where distinct racial and ethnic groups blend into a multi-ethnic stew. Indeed, seemingly overlooked in the Pew Report is the finding that less than 5 percent of all married whites have a spouse of a different race or ethnicity. The vast majority of whites today -- as in the past -- marry other whites. What is changing are marriage patterns among America's minorities, but in ways that are not easy to understand or summarize in short news releases.  (Pew used the categories of non-Hispanic whites, blacks, Asians, American Indians and Hispanics.) For example, Pew reports that the share of newly married blacks with spouses of a different race increased threefold between 1980 and 2008. Media accounts have variously trumpeted this as good or bad news for America's future, depending on the presumptive beliefs and attitudes of their audiences about racial matters. It is easy to forget the U.S. Supreme Court waited until 1967, in Loving v. Virginia, to outlaw state prohibitions against interracial marriage. Increases in black-white marriages, at least on a percentage basis, are large because baseline numbers are very small. Romantics like to believe that love is blind. We embrace the idea that falling in love is a product of our emotions rather than rational deliberation. Of course, the empirical evidence suggests otherwise. Love may be blind, but it clearly is not color-blind. Indeed, for all the hyperventilation, the demographic reality is that only about 15 percent of newly married blacks today became married to whites or other minorities. This is hardly a basis for celebrating a new racial tolerance in America or, if you prefer, for now believing that white identity is rapidly being lost to interracial intimacy and childbearing. Unfortunately, most of the nation's headlines ignored Pew's observation that intermarriage rates with whites actually have declined among Asians and Hispanics since 1980. This is something new. My research with Julie Carmalt and Zhenchao Qian, to be published in Sociological Forum, documents recent declines in intermarriage rates among U.S.-born Hispanics and Asians after decades-long increases. Declines in intermarriage have been largest among the second generation, the U.S.-born children of immigrant parents. Among second-generation Hispanics, for example, intermarriages with whites declined by more than one-third between 1995 and 2008. Over the same period, they became more likely to marry Hispanic immigrants. Since 1980, there has been a fivefold increase in the number of native-born Asian women marrying Asian immigrants. One explanation is that substantial new immigration has simply expanded the marriage opportunities for native-born Hispanics and Asians. But it is also likely that the extraordinary recent growth of the immigrant population has reinforced a new sense of identity rooted in shared ethnicity and culture. This seems to have encouraged more in-marriage with co-ethnics at the expense of more out-marriage with whites. Demographers sometimes consider intermarriage to be the final step in the assimilation process, or an indicator of racial boundaries or lack of them. The current retreat from intermarriage among America's non-black minorities raises new questions about racial and ethnic balkanization in America. Issues of race and immigration are an important part of the public dialogue. In today's highly charged political environment, it is easy to latch onto information that buttresses our own point of view and preconceptions. Unfortunately, short headlines and easy-to-digest narratives about rising intermarriage rates tend to oversimplify or even distort a complicated statistical story that is still unfolding. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daniel T. Lichter.","Daniel Lichter: 1 of 7 new 2008 marriages was interracial or interethnic, report says .

"London, England (CNN) -- Fashion designer Alexander McQueen hanged himself in his wardrobe and left a suicide note, a coroner told a London inquest Wednesday. McQueen, 40, was found dead at his London apartment Thursday. The cause of death was asphyxia and hanging, said coroner's officer Lynda Martindill. A police officer told the inquest that McQueen's death was ""nonsuspicious,"" according to Martindill. ""The coroner said a note had been found and is being looked at by the police,"" Martindill said, without offering details about the note. The coroner adjourned the inquest until April 28 in order to complete the full post-mortem report, she said. McQueen, who had dressed stars from Sarah Jessica Parker and Nicole Kidman to Rihanna and Sandra Bullock, killed himself nine days after the death of his mother. He expressed his devastation at her death on his Twitter account days before he died. McQueen, whose real name was Lee Alexander McQueen, had a reputation for controversy that earned him the titles ""enfant terrible"" and ""the hooligan of English fashion."" British Vogue Editor Alexandra Shulman called him a ""modern-day genius."" ""His brilliant imagination knew no bounds,"" she said after his death. Eccentric singer Lady Gaga, who called herself a big fan and wore McQueen's alien-inspired stilettos in a recent video, dedicated her performance at Tuesday night's BRIT Awards in London to the designer. McQueen was born in 1970 in London's East End, the son of a taxi driver, according to a biography on the Vogue Web site. He trained in London's Savile Row at a company that made suits for Prince Charles. One anecdote that helped cement his bad-boy image was that he had once embroidered a suit for the Prince of Wales with a profanity sewn into the lining. His clothing line was purchased in 1991 by stylist Isabella Blow, who became a close friend. She committed suicide in 2007, five years after his label was brought into the Gucci Group, based in Paris, France. In an interview with CNN's Jim Bittermann in October, McQueen spoke of the changing nature of runway shows for fashion designers. His latest show was an invitation event for 1,000 people, and was streamed live on the Internet. ""It's got to progress and it's got to move on,"" he said. ""I've been doing these shows for over 15 years now; I must have done about 60 shows. Even I get bored with the same concept, so this way, I can see a brighter future for fashion."" The designer was honored as a commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in 2003, and won numerous other awards in the fashion world.","Coroner tells inquest designer left note and hanged himself .

"(CNN) -- Rapper Fat Joe and others in his entourage were briefly detained and questioned early Monday after a woman reported an alleged sexual assault, Madison, Wisconsin, police said. The 33-year-old Madison woman called police with a complaint of ""inappropriate touching"" after Fat Joe -- whose real name is Joseph Cartagena -- performed at the city's Orpheum Theater Sunday night, a police report said. Cartagena's lawyer said the woman was a ""pretender groupie"" who was attempting to ""shake down"" the rapper for money. Shortly after the concert ended, the woman ""found herself inside of a Cadillac Limousine with Joseph Cartagena and other male subjects all with the destination of a hotel located on Madison's west side,"" the police report said. The address listed by police is on the University of Wisconsin campus, a half mile from the theater. ""There were allegations of inappropriate touching involving the female, and after some time had elapsed, the female reported this matter to Madison Police,"" the report said. Cartagena and the others in his entourage were released after they were questioned, but the investigation continued, police said. Attorney Dawn Florio issued a statement Tuesday about what she said were ""false allegations made by a woman who initially posed as a fan and later claimed to be the victim of an assault after demanding money."" ""At no point did Mr. Cartagena or any member of his entourage assault or have any improper contact with the woman,"" Florio said. ""It is truly unfortunate that false allegations such as these cause the public to doubt the claims of actual victims of sexual assaults."" CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report.","Police detained, questioned Fat Joe, entourage .

"(CNN) -- For gay teens Constance McMillen and Ceara Sturgis, high school has ended, but acceptance of their sexuality in each of their Mississippi towns is just beginning, they say. McMillen made headlines in the spring when she asked to attend her prom wearing a tuxedo and escorting a girl. Her school district in Itawamba County canceled the prom entirely. (On Tuesday, McMillen is in the spotlight again as she travels to the White House to meet President Obama at a ceremony recognizing the contributions of LGBT Americans.) The superintendent of the Itawamba County school district told CNN that she couldn't comment on the case while the case is pending. Around 250 miles away in Wesson, Sturgis wore a tuxedo, instead of the traditional drape or dress, for her senior portrait. She believes that she was penalized by being omitted from the senior section in her yearbook. Neither the principal nor the school's superintendent would talk with CNN. After repeated calls, the district office administrator told CNN, ""We're done."" In October, the principal told a Jackson TV station he wasn't able to comment ""on that particular situation."" ""Everything happens for a reason,"" Sturgis said in an interview with CNN's Soledad O'Brien. ""This is the start of something new. I think that this can be the change for gay youth. One day it's going to be different. And somebody has to start it, and why not us?"" The two women have become a support system for each other, connected, in part, by the Mississippi Safe School Coalition. The group is made up of mostly college and high school students who are working to make schools in Mississippi safer for, and more accepting of, gay youth. McMillen reached out to Sturgis after viewing a Facebook site the MSSC set up to promote Sturgis' cause. In 2004, the national gay rights group GLSEN -- Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network -- issued a report that said of all 50 states, Mississippi had the most hostile environment for gay youth. ""Even starting a GSA (Gay Straight Alliance club) at your school or taking a same sex date to prom is a revolutionary act,"" explains Izzy Pellegrine, a gay youth activist and 19-year-old sophomore at Mississippi State. ""Just being out in your high school... you can be the only LGBT person that anyone in your high school has ever met."" Pellegrine is a board member of the group that has hosted training sessions in how to start gay-straight alliance clubs, lobbied for anti-bullying bills and started a ""prom-watch"" to identify schools where they think kids might be discriminated against. McMillen transferred schools and completed the final weeks of her senior year in Jackson, Mississippi. She says the stress was just too overwhelming. ""At one point I was walking through the lunchroom and there were people booing. I've gotten a lot of hateful text messages."" In March, a federal judge ruled McMillen's first amendment rights were violated when her school district refused to let her attend her prom in a tux with a girl and canceled the prom. The judge didn't order the school to host the prom because parents had already planned a parent-sponsored prom. McMillen believes the alternative prom she was sent to was a sham because only a handful of people attended. ""A lot of people were talking about how it was a joke just set up for me,"" she says. The ACLU has filed a complaint in response and another court hearing is pending. The school district denies it directed McMillen to a fake prom. McMillen says despite the difficult times, she wants to return to Itawamba and begin studies at the local junior college. She wants to be near her high school girlfriend. She says it won't be easy. ""My best friend -- we had been friends for like seven years -- has not spoken with me since the day they canceled prom,"" she says. Sturgis says her classmates are more accepting than McMillen's classmates, but that didn't lessen the sting. ""Let's say we put [my tuxedo picture] in the yearbook. Would anybody hurt like I hurt since I'm not in the yearbook?"" she says tearfully. ""It wouldn't hurt anyone."" She says she's considering suing, but knows that won't get her picture in Wesson's 2010 yearbook. ""Hopefully it will help somebody else in my same situation,"" she says. ""And that's what I'm really aiming for. I don't want anyone else to go through what I'm going through. This was a lot to handle in one year. I think people should be able to wear what they want to wear for their senior picture. It's not hurting anyone else and this yearbook is for them. It's not for the teachers.""","Constance McMillen finished out her high school senior year at another school .

"(CNN) -- The United States operates an air base in Kyrgyzstan. The keystone of the Pentagon's Northern Distribution Network, it keeps essential matériel moving into Afghanistan for NATO troops, notwithstanding steady disruption on the roads out of Pakistan. Russia, which insists that Kyrgyzstan is in its ""sphere of influence"" and claims a special right to protect ethnic Russians living there, has its own air base only a few miles away from the one used by the Americans. In theory, both of these installations serve the mutual security interests of Kyrgyzstan and its great power allies.  In theory, the bases demonstrate shared security interests between Russia, the United States and Kyrgyzstan. Today Kyrgyzstan faces the most severe crisis of its history -- and the United States and Russia should act together to help alleviate it. Perhaps as many as 2,000 of Kyrgyzstan's citizens have perished in acts of unspeakable terrorist depravity and violence. Perhaps a half million have suddenly lost their homes and possessions. Kyrgyzstan's government lit an urgent beacon calling on its allies for help. It had fair expectations of getting it. Franklin Roosevelt, after all, reminded Americans that a good neighbor comes rushing when the house next door is on fire -- so how would a neighbor respond if he actually occupies a room in that burning house? But so far America and Russia have offered little beyond token gestures. When President Obama and Russian President Dmitri Medvedev hold their summit this week in Washington, the situation in Kyrgyzstan will certainly figure on their agenda.  Will they offer the world leadership in resolving it? Over the last week, acts of horrendous violence occurred in and around the 2,000-year-old city of Osh in southern Kyrgyzstan.  The acts were methodical and clearly well planned.  They involved waves of assault by attackers wearing military and police uniforms, operating armored personnel carriers and other military equipment, followed by gangs of young toughs armed with clubs, rifles and knives. Video: Refugees say Kyrgyz troops shot at civilians . The attackers killed without hesitation or remorse, looted entire neighborhoods, and torched what could not be carted off.  Because in many cases the attackers appeared to be ethnic Kyrgyz and the victims ethnic Uzbeks, many observers were quick to characterize these events as acts of ethnic violence between groups with a long history of mutual animosity. But scholars with depth in the region warned against these characterizations. ""I don't believe in a narrative of long-simmering ethnic tension,"" said Columbia University's Alex Cooley. In an appearance on PBS's ""Newshour,"" the Brookings Institution's Fiona Hill made a similar point, cautioning against the ""ethnic tension"" narrative and noting that ""there's a really strong political component to this."" Cooley and Hill are correct.  There were interethnic clashes in 1990, in the waning days of the Soviet Union, but even then the circumstances were suspicious.  The pogroms that began in Osh a week ago reflect careful coordination and organization. The major question is: Who is behind this?  The interim government in Bishkek lays a charge at the feet of the deposed dictator, Kurmanbek Bakiyev, who hails from the South and still has support there. Moreover, many of the police and military leaders in this region were appointed by Bakiyev and do not appear to be particularly loyal to the new government. The government's charges are credible, but it's likely that the initial waves of violence also provided cover for score-settling, and it seems that criminal elements, particularly narcotics traffickers, have exploited the situation with zeal. Here are some points on which Medvedev and Obama should be able to agree: . • Restraint: At present both Uzbek and Kyrgyz armed groups are involved in random shootings designed to reinforce perceptions of their group being persecuted. Rape and crimes involving sexual violence have been a particularly worrying aspect of the troubles. A strong appeal for restraint and respect for the security measures imposed by the Kyrgyz government should be issued. • Protecting civilians at risk: At least 400,000 people have been forced to leave their homes, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.  In many cases the homes have been incinerated with all their possessions, leaving them nothing to return to. Protecting those who have lost their homes and loved ones from further acts of violence must be a top priority. Security must be established at their camps; bedding, sanitary facilities, food and medical care must be arranged urgently. • Humanitarian security/policing operation:  Because thousands of people have been traumatized after being attacked by people they greeted as policemen or soldiers, heightening anxiety along an ethnic fault line, outsiders can provide an important measure of confidence. International monitors can patrol with the local police and army, and international security can protect those delivering humanitarian assistance.  But further steps may be necessary if the local security arrangements collapse and another plea for foreign troops is issued. • An investigation: The best way to avoid a repetition of the events of last week is to make clear that those who committed acts of murder, looting, rape and arson will be identified and punished for what they did. A broad, credible, independent investigation should be undertaken into the events and their origin, led by a person of international prominence with prosecutorial experience and a mandate to establish the facts and lay the foundation for criminal prosecutions of the perpetrators. • Reconstruction: The devastation in central Osh and in numerous villages is reported to be near total. The international community, under U.S. and Russian leadership, should provide generous support to jumpstart the reconstruction process, prioritizing its assistance to those most directly injured by the violence. • Elections: Kyrgyzstan's dictator was toppled by a violent uprising in April. The country still has no democratically elected government. Establishing a legitimate elected government is therefore essential to restoring stability. The international community should mobilize observers to help assure that the elections are fair and free. Special efforts need to be made to insure that those who lost their homes and property in the violence are able to fully participate in these elections. Obama and Medvedev have taken laudable steps to reshape the Russian-American relationship, systematically eliminating points of conflict and developing new points of cooperation.  But the crisis in Osh invites them to show joint leadership, providing examples for the entire world community about how to address a humanitarian crisis on the territory of an allied state.  The lives of hundreds of thousands depend upon it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.","Kyrgyzstan violence has claimed many lives, forced many from their homes .

"Okaloosa Island, Florida (CNN) -- If you live in Okaloosa County, Florida, or Destin on Florida's Emerald Coast and are wondering who's going to be calling the shots if black crude oil comes ashore -- wonder no more. It won't be the federal government. ""I think there's a fundamental flaw in the federal response,"" said Dino Villani, the county's public safety director. ""When you're down in the trenches trying to respond like we are, it doesn't work,"" he said. The Okaloosa County Commission voted unanimously this week to allow their emergency managers to override and overrule federal emergency managers and take on the responsibility of saving the sand and beaches that provide about 50 percent of their economy. Tourist bookings are down about 30 percent this summer, according to local officials. ""This is our home, and in my home I have responsibility to take care of what is necessary around my home,"" said Okaloosa County chairman Wayne Harris. ""I certainly don't expect someone from across the U.S. to come and save the day for us,"" he said. But they did wonder if they'd be going to jail for defying the federal government's cleanup operation. ""We knew that was the possibility,"" Harris said. ""In fact the Coast Guard had told us that, 'Commissioners, if you do that there's a potential you would go to jail,' and we said, 'Well, so be it, but we gotta protect our waterways and our people,'"" he said. But on Wednesday, the National Incident Command told the county it could take control of the defense of its shores. ""We're not looking to get into an argument, but there is an overriding federal interest in those waterways, and the safety of those waterways is the responsibility of the Coast Guard,"" said Adm. Thad Allen, the national incident commander. ""We need to sit down, have open dialogue and conversation to arrive at effects we want to achieve,"" he said. So far, the area on Florida's panhandle has seen only weathered oil in the form of tar balls and tar mousse, but Okaloosa County, along with the city of Destin, have agreed to move forward with a unified plan to protect their beaches and waterways. They say they'll be spending about $5 million per month to protect their land, and they have one message to the feds. ""Have our backs. Let us go out and do our jobs,"" Villani said. ""We've got to protect the public,"" he said. Florida had the luxury of being able to sit on the sidelines for a while as the gushing crude meandered around the Gulf of Mexico, plaguing beaches in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. With constant criticism of the Obama administration's response to the spill, this small part of Florida may have just opened a political can of worms, especially if oil begins to push east. Will other counties also want to take over their local battles against crude? ""I certainly hope they do,"" Harris said. ""That's what you're paid for or that's what your responsibilities are when you are the leader.""","Okaloosa County commissioners say they are responsibly for their county .

"(CNN) -- Rapper Lil' Wayne may avoid jail time on an Arizona drug charge, according to a plea deal that was announced Monday. The only problem is the rapper is already in jail. Lil' Wayne is currently serving a year in prison in New York for gun charges. But he appeared in an Arizona court Monday via video. The rapper, whose legal name is Dwayne Carter, could receive 36 months probation in the plea deal, according to court documents from Yuma County Superior Court in Arizona. Carter was facing a maximum sentence of three-plus years in prison if convicted in the Arizona case, according to court documents. The charges stem from a January 2008 bust on his tour bus where the drug ecstasy was allegedly found in his backpack. The plea deal is a recommendation and needs to be confirmed when Carter goes in front of a judge at a later date. Lil' Wayne is a multiplatinum-selling and Grammy-winning rap artist. His hits include ""The Block is Hot"" and ""Lollipop."" His album ""Tha Carter III"" was the top selling disc of 2008. His latest album, ""Rebirth,"" was released earlier this year. The New York charges stem from his arrest in 2007 outside New York City's Beacon Theater. According to police, Carter had a .40-caliber pistol on his tour bus. His attorney said it belonged to someone else.","Lil Wayne pleads guilty to drug charge .

"(CNN)  -- John Isner of the United States and his French opponent Nicolas Mahut made tennis history at Wimbledon on Wednesday as they contested the longest grand slam singles match of all time -- and it is still to be finished. It was called off for the day due to bad light at 59 games all in the fifth and deciding set after 10 hours of action on Court 18 at the All England Club. During the marathon fifth set, the pair surpassed the previous record of six hours and 33 minutes set at the 2004 French Open, when Fabrice Santoro beat fellow Frenchman Arnaud Clement 6-4 6-3 6-7 3-6 16-14. The duration of the fifth set alone, currently standing at seven hours and six minutes, beat the previous record. The giant Isner has also set a world record for aces in a match, sending down 98 with Mahut notching up 95. ""Nothing like this will ever happen again, ever,"" said a visibly shattered Isner. ""I don't know what to say."" Isner had match point at 59-58, but Mahut saved it with an ace and went on to level again. Match officials then called the game off at 9:10 pm local time although Isner wanted to play on. Mahut, who had appeared the less tired, said: ""We played for too long, I don't know how many hours we played."" The first round match had been stopped the previous night due to bad light and had still not been finished 24 hours later.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The United States replaced the top allied commander in Afghanistan on Monday, deciding ""fresh eyes"" are needed to reverse the course of the seven-year-old war there, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said. Gen. David McKiernan is being replaced as commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan. Gen. David McKiernan, who has held the post for less than a year, will be replaced by Lt. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, a former special operations chief, Gates announced. He told reporters there was ""nothing specific"" behind McKiernan's removal, but that ""new leadership and fresh eyes"" were needed in a war that Washington admits it is not winning. ""We have a new strategy, a new mission and a new ambassador. I believe that new military leadership also is needed,"" Gates said. McKiernan will remain in place until the Senate confirms the appointments of McChrystal and his designated deputy, Lt. Gen. David Rodriguez. Both have previous experience in Afghanistan and more history with counterinsurgency operations than McKiernan. Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in March that the Afghan war ""is winnable, but we are not winning."" Since taking office in January, President Obama has committed an additional 21,000 troops and trainers to Afghanistan in an effort to battle a resurgent Taliban and signed off on McKiernan's replacement, the White House said. ""The president was grateful for and impressed by the leadership that Gen. McKiernan demonstrated in calling for additional resources for the fight in Afghanistan,"" the White House said in a written statement. ""This change of direction in Afghanistan in no way diminishes the president's deep respect for Gen. McKiernan and his decades of public service."" And in a statement of his own, McKiernan said the U.S. military ""must remain committed to the great people of Afghanistan."" ""While the Taliban and other terrorist groups offer only lies and fear, our continued efforts promote freedom and hope,"" he said. The United States invaded Afghanistan in October 2001 in response to the September 11, 2001, al Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington. It quickly displaced the ruling Taliban, which had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory, but the top al Qaeda and Taliban leaders slipped the noose and remain at large. A total of 1,135 allied troops, including 678 Americans, have been killed in Afghanistan since the war began. The Taliban. meanwhile, has taken root in neighboring Pakistan, which launched a new offensive against the militants last week. McChrystal and Rodriguez ""bring a unique skill set in counterinsurgency to these issues, and I think that they will provide the kind of new leadership and fresh thinking that the admiral and I have been talking about,"" Gates said. Gates' announcement came less than a week after Obama met with the presidents of Afghanistan and Pakistan and pledged a more coordinated effort to defeat the insurgents. Afghanistan, meanwhile, has been complaining about civilian deaths in U.S. airstrikes, including one last week that killed dozens of people. But Gates said civilian casualties are down in Afghanistan compared with last year, while U.S. and allied casualties are up by 75 percent. ""There is a tremendous effort going on, on our part to try and avoid civilian casualties,"" he said. ""But figuring out how to come out better on the strategic communications side of this is an ongoing challenge for us.""

"(CNN) -- Former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick was indicted Wednesday on 19 counts of federal fraud and tax charges, according to the U.S. attorney's office in the Eastern District of Michigan. The charges against him include 10 counts of mail fraud, three counts of wire fraud, five counts of filing a false tax return and one count of tax evasion, according to U.S. District Court spokesman Rod Hanson. If he is convicted, each fraud count would carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000, while each tax count would carry a maximum sentence of up to five years in prison and a fine of $250,000, the U.S. attorney's office said. The charges stem from an alleged scheme in which Kilpatrick used donations to his Kilpatrick Civic Fund -- a tax-exempt social welfare organization -- to pay for such personal expenses as yoga and golf lessons, and campaign expenses in his 2001 and 2005 bids for mayor, according to the indictment. Kilpatrick had claimed the fund would go toward community services and voter registration information, the indictment says. Kilpatrick, 40, is currently serving five years in prison for violating probation in a 2008 case against him. That case involved two felony counts of obstruction of justice stemming from Kilpatrick's efforts to cover up an extramarital affair. He also pleaded no contest to charges of assaulting a police officer attempting to serve a subpoena on a Kilpatrick friend in the case.","Former Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick could be sentenced to 20 more years in prison .

"New York (CNN) -- More than 1,000 people in New Jersey and New York, many of them adolescent Orthodox Jews, have been sickened with mumps since August, health authorities said Monday. Orange County, New York, has confirmed 494 cases since early November, county spokesman Richard Mayfield told CNN. Almost all of those infected with the virus are of the Orthodox or Hasidic Jewish population, and their average age is 14, he said. Neighboring Rockland County has confirmed 317 cases since August, with all of the sick from the Orthodox Jewish community, said Kathleen Henry, county Deputy Commissioner of Health. Their average is 14 to 18, she said. Just south of the two counties, in New York City, Brooklyn had 79 confirmed cases of mumps as of October 30, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in November. Any confirmation of other infections in the city are expected to be announced Tuesday. The mumps outbreak began at a summer camp for Orthodox Jewish boys in Sullivan County, New York, according to the CDC. Health officials have linked the outbreak to an 11-year-old boy at the camp. He had recently returned from the United Kingdom, where a mumps outbreak had spread to 4,000 people. The mumps outbreak also spread to Ocean County, New Jersey, where 159 confirmed cases have been diagnosed since September, county spokeswoman Leslie Terjesen told CNN. An additional 70 others are suspected of having mumps, she said. Only seven of the infected are not Orthodox Jewish, but they all had exposure to the community, Terjesen said. The average age of the sick is 21, she said. Lakewood, New Jersey, Rabbi Yehunda Pirutinsky was surprised when his 14-year-old son was diagnosed with mumps a week ago. Lakewood is in Ocean County. ""He was completely vaccinated,"" Pirutinsky said. ""So it was a surprise to us he came down with mumps."" Anyone fully vaccinated from mumps receives two doses of the vaccine, according to the CDC. Of the New Jersey cases, 77 percent were vaccinated, Terjesen said. But the vaccine is not 100 percent effective, according to the CDC. At two doses, the vaccine is 76 to 95 percent effective, the CDC says on its Web site. In November, the CDC called the spike in mumps cases, ""the largest U.S. mumps outbreak since 2006, when the United States experienced a resurgence of mumps with 6,584 reported cases."" Then, only 179 people were sickened in New York and New Jersey. Mumps is a contagious disease caused by a virus, according to the CDC. Initial symptoms appear 12 to 25 days after infection and include fever, headache, muscle aches and loss of appetite. Mumps can cause the jaw and cheeks to swell, with further complications including the inflammation of the brain, testicles or ovaries, and deafness, according to the CDC. Pirutinsky's son has fully recovered from his bout with mumps, which Pirutinsky assumes he contracted while at his Jewish high school. A doctor advised the teenager to not attend school for a week and limit time with his siblings, Pirutinsky said. The outbreak has disproportionately affected Orthodox Jewish communities, but Pirutinsky said he wasn't overly worried. ""I wouldn't say the community is alarmed, but it's something we're aware of,"" he said. CNN's Edmund DeMarche, Miriam Falco and Nicole Bliman contributed to this report.","Almost all the cases of mumps involve adolescent Orthodox Jews .

"London, England (CNN) -- The forthcoming Rolling Stone profile of Gen. Stanley McChrystal that was leaked to the press Monday has now taken on a life of its own. ""The Runaway General,"" by former Newsweek correspondent Michael Hastings, offers a very close look at the four- star general who commands U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan. The piece is available in digital format to anyone who wants to read it ahead of its scheduled publication. Some very smart writers, bloggers and tweeters have been dissecting it now for the better part of a full day, critical of the attitudes and behaviors described in it as examples of arrogance, vindictiveness, frustration, or just plain old poor judgment. This isn't the first time McChrystal has been profiled in the media. When he first took charge of the Afghanistan mission in the summer of 2009, he was heralded for his past achievements as a Special Forces officer and his approach to getting things done in both Iraq and Afghanistan. His personal asceticism was a source of awe: sleeping four hours a night, running 15 kilometers and eating a single meal per day, all while directing an extremely difficult mission. He was, by all accounts, the right man for the right job, and could be trusted to sift through the mess, defeat the enemy, and bring the troops home. His conduct has generally been correct and professional, too, despite significant differences of political and military opinion on America's Afghanistan policy. That was at the beginning of his tour. Now, after almost a year, he appears to have either deliberately let his guard down or been caught with his pants around his ankles. Hastings, who spent a month with McChrystal, writes that he is ""determined to put his personal stamp on Afghanistan, to use it as a laboratory for a controversial military strategy known as counterinsurgency."" He also describes McChrystal's entourage as a ""handpicked collection of killers, spies, geniuses, patriots, political operators and outright maniacs."" To those who have been following the issues, these read like the awkward, breathless observations of an ingénue -- or like material packaged to sell to an audience more attuned to music and pop culture than war and foreign policy. What's really got everyone's attention, though, is the article's candid descriptions of what appears to be the McChrystal team's (""Team America"") contempt for its civilian counterparts and masters, including President Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Carl Eikenberry and Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke. McChrystal issued a formal apology Tuesday, just ahead of the viral stream that propelled the article across the web. Observers are critical that it may not be enough. Washington has now recalled McChrystal to explain himself, and Duncan Boothby, the civilian press aide who arranged Hastings' access, has reportedly resigned his post. As the bodies begin to fall, some are pessimistic about what the future holds for McChrystal, and whether, by this time Wednesday, he will still be in command of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan. The article raises as many questions about its author as it does about the command culture surrounding McChrystal. It is difficult to fathom that any reporter would be granted warts-and-all access to the inner sanctum, with no strings attached. Were there any? It is equally hard to understand how members of Team America could feel free to speak as unguardedly as they did -- much less cut loose under the influence of alcohol, as Hastings described it -- and expect a good journalist in their midst to not record his observations. In an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Rolling Stone executive editor Eric Bates contended the comments made by McChrystal and other top military aides during the interview were ""not off-the-cuff remarks,"" he said. They ""knew what they were doing when they granted the access."" The story shows ""a deep division"" and ""war within the administration"" over strategy in Afghanistan. Mostly, it's difficult to discern what it is Hastings was trying to accomplish with the article, which feels like it wants to be two separate things: a balanced and in-depth profile, or an out-and-out hatchet job. On the former, it fails to convince -- the author's grasp of context is uneven, at best. On the latter, his collected quips are hardly worth the gasps and tisks they've earned thus far, and don't lend themselves well to the context he's trying to convey. Hastings, a young reporter whose work has been published in a variety of reputable publications, including the Washington Post, the L.A. Times, GQ and Foreign Policy, was a Newsweek correspondent in Iraq from 2005 to 2007. His girlfriend, Andi Parhamovich, another young journalist, followed him there; she was killed in a Sunni militia ambush in January 2007. His memoir of the experience, ""I Lost My Love in Baghdad: A Modern War Story"", was published in 2008, and quickly panned by New Yorker staff writer George Packer in a review in the New York Times. It was ""really two books"" that failed to reconcile the war story and their romance. It had an ""embarrassing title."" It carried a ""whiff of exploitation,"" and it suffered from ""literary shortcomings."" More to the point, Packer is one of several journalists, along with the Washington Post's Rajiv Chandrasekaran and Dexter Filkins of the New York Times (among others) to have written notable accounts of their time reporting from Iraq. Some, like Filkins' book ""The Forever War,"" are more intensely personal than others; the better volumes convey, in one way or another, the sense of social distance that separates their authors from the subjects they write about and from the world outside. That's not what Hastings does. He can, according to Packer, ""convey the deadly ennui of a foot patrol"" but ""is unable to rise rhetorically to the tragedy"" of his girlfriend's death. Substitute a few details, and that becomes a remarkably apt description of the Rolling Stones piece. Hastings clearly demonstrates a keen eye for off-color detail, but fails to weave the threads into something more coherent or meaningful. Getting the facts straight and reporting them is one thing; knowing your subject and making sense of it is quite another. That's important, and something the Obama Administration should keep in mind before making a decision on the basis of a single reporter's work. If McChrystal is to be sacked, it should be because the White House thinks the relationship between its military and civilian elements in Afghanistan is important to the mission and needs fixing, or because it wants to shift directions in Afghanistan and a change of military leadership would be the best way to make it happen. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Innes.","An article entitled ""The Runaway General"" puts Gen. Stanley McChrystal under scrutiny .

"Lima, Peru (CNN) -- The 21-year-old Peruvian woman Joran van der Sloot is accused of killing had a cranial fracture and other significant injuries to her face and neck and showed signs of asphyxiation, a court document obtained by CNN shows. Forensic luminol tests in the hotel room where her body was found showed blood on the floors, hallway and mattress, the document said. The body of Stephany Flores was in such a decomposed state that an autopsy was difficult to perform, the document said. The autopsy revealed Flores had used amphetamines, it said. Peruvian authorities have charged van der Sloot with murder. He also is the lead suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Alabama teenager Natalee Holloway in Aruba. Van der Sloot was arrested twice in connection with Holloway's disappearance in Aruba but was never charged because of lack of evidence. Peruvian police said Monday they conducted a psychological evaluation of van der Sloot. The evaluation showed van der Sloot has a low tolerance for frustration and ""doesn't value the female role,"" according to excerpts from the report, which prosecutors gave to a judge. According to the document, van der Sloot ""does not tolerate when someone tries to contradict him. It generates in him a challenging attitude."" The report calls him ""emotionally immature,"" which elicits strong changes in behavior that can send him out of control. ""He reflects a certain dominance over the opposite sex. He doesn't value the female role,"" the document states. It adds, ""He presents traits of an anti-social personality"" and is ""indifferent towards others' well-being."" Despite this, the report says, ""he doesn't show any psychopathological trauma that impedes him from perceiving and evaluating reality."" Also Monday, Van der Sloot told the judge his rights and due process were violated after his arrest, his attorney told CNN. The judge will decide on the legality of van der Sloot's incarceration by Wednesday, lawyer Maximo Altez said. If the ruling is unfavorable to van der Sloot, Altez said, he is prepared to appeal to the highest court. While in front of the judge, van der Sloot declined to give a formal statement on the facts of the case, according to the court. The reason he gave was he hopes the statements he allegedly gave to police that led to his imprisonment will be nullified. Van der Sloot's decision will not hold up the legal proceedings against him, the court said. A Dutch newspaper article published Monday quotes van der Sloot as saying he was ""tricked"" into confessing to the murder of Flores. Peruvian police told him that if he signed the papers they gave him, he would be transferred to the Netherlands, he told De Telegraaf in a jail interview. ""In my blind panic I signed everything, but never knew what was written on them,"" he said. Altez -- who had said last week he was quitting as van der Sloot's attorney, but has not -- has maintained that the judge in the case should strike down van der Sloot's confession because he was not properly represented when he was interrogated. But Peruvian police have defended the interrogation, saying that van der Sloot's confession was acquired legally. According to transcripts of his confession, van der Sloot said he elbowed Flores in the face before strangling her and then suffocating her with his shirt. The transcripts were provided to CNN by a police source who has not been named because he was not authorized to pass along the material. ""There was blood everywhere,"" van der Sloot said in the transcripts. ""What am I going to do now. I had blood on my shirt. There was also blood on the bed, so, I took my shirt and put it on her face, pressing hard, until I killed Stephany."" Van der Sloot told authorities he attacked Flores on May 30 after she read an e-mail on his computer connected with the Holloway case. It was five years to the day from Holloway's disappearance. After killing Flores, police say, van der Sloot took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile, where he was arrested on June 3. He was returned the next day to Peru. Van der Sloot told police in Chile a different story of how Flores died when he was arrested there, according to transcripts. He blamed the death on robbers who had waited for him at his hotel in Peru. But Peru authorities said they had overwhelming evidence pointing to van der Sloot, and when he was transferred to Peru, van der Sloot confessed to the crime, police said. Van der Sloot is being held in a high-security area of the Miguel Castro Castro prison where only two of 10 cells are occupied, and he has no contact with inmates in the general prison population. He is under guard 24 hours a day, authorities have said.","Stephany Flores had cranial fracture, autopsy report says .

"(InStyle.com) -- New York City restaurateur Donatella Arpaia shows how to cook flawless pasta, how to pair it with the ideal sauce, and even the secret to boiling water (yes, there's a right way!) Donatella Arpaia gives her bucatini the taste test. Pasta 101 . • Always buy 100 percent durum-wheat pasta made in Italy (De Cecco is a good supermarket brand). • Cook pasta in a two gallon stockpot. Bring water (a gallon for every pound) to a rolling boil, then add two tablespoons of salt per gallon. Never add oil, which prevents sauce from adhering to pasta. When water returns to a boil, add pasta. Stir often to prevent sticking. • A minute before the package time indicates, take out a piece of pasta and bite it. As soon as it's a uniform, translucent color, drain (but never rinse), add sauce and serve. Sauce secrets . • Marry the sauce to its pasta: When pasta is just shy of done, add it to the pan of sauce. Toss over high heat for 2 minutes (add a little reserved pasta water if sauce is too thick). • If you are using cheese in your dish, mix in a couple tablespoons with drained pasta first; it makes the pasta stickier so sauce clings to it. • Don't over-sauce pasta. Use it as a condiment, with just enough to cover each strand. • Use the right pasta shapes: Flat (like fettucine) with creamy sauces; long, thin (spaghetti, linguine) with seafood sauces; holes or ridges (rigatoni) or molded (farfalle) with chunky sauces; very thin (angel hair) with light sauces; thick and tubular (ziti) for baked dishes. Must-haves . Arpaia gives the secrets to making pasta at home taste as delicious as at her restaurants: . 1. Fresh rosemary smells great and is handy to snip into a dish. 2. Present pasta beautifully in a ceramic bowl. 3. Add Italian sea-salt tablet to boiling water. 4. A must: sleek stainless spaghetti tongs that effortlessly hold pasta. 5.

"(CNN) -- A fast-developing storm spawned at least one tornado Sunday in Billings, Montana, ripping the roof off a massive entertainment complex and causing extensive damage in the region. No injuries were reported. Amateur video shows the funnel cloud hovering over the MetraPark venue -- home to a sports arena, expo center and other facilities -- kicking up debris and peeling away the roof of one of the complex's buildings. Gov. Brian Schweitzer estimated that the roof damage could cost between $8 million and $15 million, but noted it was fortunate the arena was not hosting an event when the twister struck around 4:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. ET). The damaged building held a football game at the same time just a night earlier, he said. Meteorologist Keith Meier of the National Weather Service in Billings estimated the tornado to be as strong as an EF2 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, with winds estimated at more than 100 mph. Meier said the storm also produced quarter- to half-dollar-sized hail. Schweitzer plans to travel to the region Monday to survey the damage; he said the National Guard is ready to assist in cleanup efforts if needed.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Large and small donations flowed in Monday evening as dozens of celebrities answered phones for Larry King's telethon to help the people of the U.S. Gulf Coast suffering from the oil disaster. ""A hundred dollars? Wow! Thanks you so much,"" rocker Tyson Ritter told one donor who called in. The two-hour CNN show raised more than $1.81 million, with proceeds going to three charities deeply involved in the efforts to help humans, wildlife and the environment. ""Everyone's really pissed off,"" actress Jenny McCarthy, who was monitoring online messages in the telethon's ""Tweet Suite,"" told host Ryan Seacrest. Donors could choose to send their money to the United Way, National Wildlife Federation or The Nature Conservancy. Celebrity journalist Giuliana Rancic said she was on the phone with ""Barbara"" from Kokomo, Indiana. ""She's saying it's the animals,"" Rancic said. Actress Victoria Principal sat next to her on another call. ""We're just talking about the wildlife,"" Principal said. Singer Aaron Neville, a New Orleans native, said most of the calls he answered in New York were from people concerned about animals impacted by the oil. ""People are crying on the phone and giving money,"" Neville said. Actor Ted Danson said it was important for him to ""hear people's emotions, their fear and sadness"" when they called in donations, . CNN correspondents reported live from the Gulf Coast, interviewing people whose lives have been interrupted by the oil disaster. ""The toughest thing I see is losing a way of life that we've had down here for generations and generations,"" said shrimper Archie Dantin in Pointe a la Hache, Louisiana. A BP spokesman issued a statement Monday saying the oil company is ""proceeding with urgency to make the situation right for the environment and for those who have affected by this tragic event."" ""We stated from the beginning that we accept responsibility for cleaning up the spill and for paying all legitimate claims for those directly impacted financially by this environmental disaster,"" BP's statement said.

"Editor's note: Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican, represents the 3rd District of Utah in Congress and is appearing in CNN.com's ""Freshman Year"" series, along with Rep. Jared Polis, a Democrat from Colorado. Here, his wife, Julie Chaffetz,  talks about how she copes with the challenges of her freshman year as a ""congressional spouse."" Julie Chaffetz and her husband, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, pose in front of a view of Washington. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- In reality, there's a lot more to serving in Congress than simply voting on the House floor. There are plenty of tasks -- technically optional -- that are essential for someone who wants to do this job well. No one makes you read the bills, but to do the job right, you must. There are constituents to meet with, letters to answer, staff to manage, media to respond to and new bills to research. These duties can eat up as much time as I can give. I'm learning to balance the workload. The real challenge for me is setting the work aside. My family is still the center of my life. I look forward to that flight home every single weekend. Through trial and error, Julie and I have learned some important strategies for making our family time count. I have learned to schedule time individually with each of my children. I also schedule time to date my wife. We met at a wedding in Arizona and started dating shortly after when I was a senior and Julie was a junior at Brigham Young University in 1989. We married in February 1991. Julie's challenges are different from mine. I'll let her explain what it's like to be a congressional spouse. Julie Chaffetz: As I sit down for a moment to type, I'm strangely aware that 10-finger typing is much harder than thumb texting -- a symptom of my life. Time seems to be flying, as the saying goes, and it is fun. Since Jason was elected to Congress, I have learned to adapt to many new challenges. Perspective is everything. Jason loves his job; I love my job. Raising three children to be healthy, happy contributors to society is my quest. Nurturing our 8, 13 and 16-year-olds is a lesson in constant motion -- or rather, commotion. It's important to me that they feel centered and cared for. Although I'm not a perfect mother, I've got great kids who reward me with hugs, smiles, occasional pouts and late-night chats. Planning is crucial. Before Congress, I tended to deal with things day-by-day. Now, time is precious. During our campaign I received some sage advice from Arizona Rep. Jeff Flake's wife, Cheryl. She recommended that when Jason is in Washington, I spend time doing the things I need to do on my own, such as errands, volunteering, time with friends, helping with homework, and home projects like learning how to repair a toilet -- and yes, I mastered this skill! So, when Jason is home, we can use our time as a family working, reconnecting and having fun. I'm a people person. Family and friends are a big part of my support. I'm the youngest of six and I have an amazing family. My parents and siblings are settled everywhere from Minnesota to Arizona. Fortunately, Utah is a great midpoint. We regularly have company; so much so that we've earned the nickname ""Hotel Chaffetz."" For day-to-day support, I'm lucky to have two very close friends. Our kids have grown up together and my friends are always there when I need anything: from picking my kids up from school if I'm running late, tending our dogs when we travel, or giving me a pep talk just when I need it. I also belong to a book club of six women. We have been laughing, counseling and spilling our guts to each other once a month for the past 16 years. And we still manage to read good books, too. One of my recent favorites is ""The Glass Castle"" by Jeannette Walls. Above all, I have learned to be flexible and keep my sense of humor. Recently, I was in Washington with Jason when he decided the right thing to do was to fly to Antigua and help some Americans out. Although I was tempted to be bugged, I chose to be flexible. I spent the rest of my day without Jason, flew home alone, and arranged for a ride home from the airport. Good friends are priceless. I'm the CEO of Utah Chaffetz and lovin' it! The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jason Chaffetz and Julie Chaffetz.","Rep. Chaffetz's wife, Julie, is raising three children; writes ""perspective is everything""

"Dallas, Texas (CNN) -- A man suspected of killing a police officer and another person Sunday night at a suburban Dallas, Texas, apartment complex was the son of the Dallas police chief, authorities said Monday. David Brown Jr., the son of Dallas Police Chief David Brown, was also killed during an exchange of gunfire with responding officers, Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez said. Lancaster, Texas, Police Chief Keith Humphrey said David Brown Jr. was a resident of the apartment complex. Humphrey also identified the slain police officer as Officer Craig Shaw, who local media said was a five-year veteran of the Lancaster force and the father of two children. Authorities at an afternoon press conference Monday wore black bands around their shields to mark the death of their fellow officer. The incident began when officers responded to a call of a shooting at the complex Sunday. ""According to our investigation, Lancaster officers were called out to a scene and shots were exchanged where two people were killed including Officer Shaw and the suspect,"" Valdez told reporters Monday. ""It appears the shooter is going to be David O'Neill Brown Jr."" ""Another male victim was also discovered dead at the scene, apparently from a shooting that had occurred earlier,"" Valdez said, adding the younger Brown is also a suspect in that victim's death. Kim Leach, a spokeswoman for the sheriff's department, identified the victim as Jeremy Jontae McMillian. McMillian's role in the incident is unknown, Leach told CNN. Several weapons were found at the scene of the shooting, including a high-powered rifle, Leach said. Charles Cato, the Dallas Police Department's first assistant chief, said, ""Chief Brown asks that the Dallas community keep his family in their prayers this evening -- and in the days to come -- as his family tries to comprehend the circumstances surrounding this tragic incident."" Humphrey later added, ""Of course, he's devastated. But Chief Brown also wanted to make that sure our officers were OK, and especially the family of Officer Shaw."" Pat Miles lives at the River Bend Apartments, where the shootings happened. ""I just heard lots of quick shots, you know, like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,"" she told CNN affiliate WFAA. ""That's all I heard. I jumped down on the floor."" Resident Tiffany James said it may have been a case of mistaken identity. ""I heard the officer say, 'Ooh. I shot the wrong person,' and he busted out crying. Another officer grabbed him and hugged him,"" James told WFAA.","NEW: Police chief's son also suspected in death of another man .

"(CNN) -- The bodies of young elephants covered in the brown dirt of dried-up wells tell a heartrending story. A baby elephant in the Gourma region of central Mali had been trapped in a well for three days. Reaching desperately for drops of water, they had lowered their trunks, toppled in, remained trapped and died in Mali's scorching heat. The ""last desert elephants in West Africa"" have ""adapted to survive in the harsh conditions"" they face, Save the Elephants said Monday. But now, the group says, conditions have gone from bad to worse, and they are living ""on the margin of what is ecologically viable."" Save the Elephants distributed new pictures Monday that depict the devastating drought and the struggle for survival in Mali, one of the poorest nations in the world. ""Six elephants have already been found dead,"" the group wrote in a news release accompanying the photos. ""Four others, including three calves, were recently extracted from a shallow well into which they had fallen when searching for water. Only the largest survived."" The youngest are in the most danger, since their smaller trunks can't reach deep into the few remaining wells, the group said. The worst drought in 26 years is threatening the existence of the ""last desert elephants in West Africa,"" the northernmost herds in the continent, Save the Elephants said. The animals, now numbering only about 350 to 450, have been called ""the last elephants of Timbuktu,"" said Jake Wall, a scientist with Save the Elephants. But they're south of Timbuktu, Wall told CNN in a phone interview from Bamako, Mali. ""We tend to refer to them as 'the last Sahelian elephants.' ""  See a map of Mali » . Each year, the elephants trek farther on the fringes of the Sahara to find water. They have the longest migration route of any in the continent, traveling ""in a counterclockwise circle"" of about 700 kilometers (435 miles), Save the Elephants said. The images are signs of the crisis gripping the northwest African nation. The U.N. Development Programme ranks Mali near the bottom of its Human Development Index. It cites a 56 percent poverty rate in the country, with nearly a third of the population unlikely to live past age 40, and an illiteracy rate of 77 percent. The World Food Programme says the majority of infant deaths in Mali are due to malnutrition. The drought, combined with soaring temperatures, has also led to deaths of cattle, Save the Elephants said. ""The stench of rotting corpses fills the air, and what little water remains is putrid and undrinkable by all standards."" In areas where the elephants live and search for water, ""the normal peaceful coexistence between the elephants and herdsmen is starting to break down and giving way to conflict over access to water,"" Wall said. There is some hope for the weeks and months ahead. ""We're hoping the rains start in June, and that will allow the elephants to start drinking out of shallow ponds until the really heavy rains begin"" in July or August, Wall said. But ""urgent action"" is needed in the interim ""to secure water for the elephants,"" Wall's group said in its news release. Save the Elephants, which focuses on helping elephant populations worldwide, said it has partnered with a foundation and the Mali government in its fundraising appeal.","Elephants dying in Mali are among 350 to 450 left in the area .

"(CNN) -- There was nothing about last Friday's biology department faculty meeting at the University of Alabama in Huntsville that portended the carnage that was to come, Professor Debra Moriarity told a reporter Wednesday. ""It was actually a really laid-back, mundane kind of faculty meeting,"" the biochemist told CNN affiliate WAAY about the 13 people seated around an oval table in Room 369 of the Shelby Center for Science and Technology. ""Events coming up, scheduling classes, budgets. It was really actually one of the easiest faculty meetings we've had."" Among the participants was Amy Bishop, a Harvard-trained geneticist with whom Moriarity had developed a professional relationship nurtured by the fact that the two women worked with cell cultures. ""Sometimes you borrow things back and forth from each other,"" she said. ""We had talked about writing grant proposals together."" After about an hour, just before 4 p.m., Bishop -- who had recently been denied tenure -- ended the calm. ""All of a sudden, she just stood up and shot,"" Moriarity said. Moriarity reacted quickly, dropping onto her hands and knees on the gray carpet. ""Just dropped to the floor and crawled under the table and crawled towards Amy,"" said Moriarity, who was focused on one thing. ""I mean, you're crawling under a table, you see the legs of a person who's shooting above the table. I grabbed her leg and, I don't know what I was thinking. I wasn't thinking anything. I was just thinking: 'Grab her!' ""And she sidestepped me. I mean, she pulled her leg free and I was in the doorway then with my back kind of to her. And I think she tried to shoot at me then, but that's when I started yelling at her, 'Amy, Amy, think about my grandson, think about my daughter! This is me! I've helped you before; I'll help you again! Don't do this Amy! Don't do this!'"" Bishop then stepped out into the hall, pointed the gun at Moriarity and pulled the trigger, the biologist said. ""It clicked, and it clicked again, and I crawled right back in the room and shut the door and she was left out in the hall."" The survivors burst into action. One person locked the wooden door, another shoved a table against it, others moved a refrigerator into place to further block the door, another called 911, others moved to help the six people who had been shot, Moriarity said. Three people died; three others were wounded. Two of them remained hospitalized Wednesday in critical condition, according to a spokeswoman for Huntsville Hospital. The third has been released. Moriarity, who joined the school's faculty in 1984, said the casualties have not affected her plans to remain at the school. And she rejected any suggestion that her role in getting Bishop out of the room was heroic. ""She followed me out in the hall and then the gun jammed and I could get back in the room,"" Moriarity said. ""That's not being a hero. That's just God looks out for you."" She said she had had little time to think. ""From the beginning until we finally got things barricaded, it couldn't have been more than 20 seconds,"" she said. Moriarity further rejected suggestions that anything could have been done to protect the victims. ""There was no way to ever anticipate this,"" she said. ""And there was nothing that could ever have been done to stop her. It all happened too fast."" And she worried that any attempt to tighten security could have negative consequences. ""There is evil in the world; it is unfortunate that good people are hurt by that. But a university is a place of free thought and freedom to explore ideas and to search out new knowledge and you don't want to put anything in place that dampens that."" Moriarity returned to her office on Wednesday and said she plans to resume teaching next week. She predicted that, with the help of anti-anxiety medication, she would be able to sleep Wednesday night. ""I've been talking to family and friends and just getting their support helps you deal with it,"" she said. ""I think right now most of us want to get back there and get things going, make plans for who is going to cover classes.""

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- The federal agency responsible for overseeing the oil industry has been renamed amid a massive reform effort following the BP oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, the Department of the Interior announced Monday. The Minerals Management Service will be called the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, according to an order signed by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar requesting the name change. The announcement coincided with the swearing-in of the bureau's new head, former Justice Department Inspector-General Michael Bromwich, who is tasked with overhauling the troubled government agency. Critics, including President Barack Obama, have said the MMS has too often catered to the interests of the industry it is responsible for policing. A 2008 report from the Interior Department's inspector-general found MMS employees received improper gifts from energy industry representatives and engaged in illegal drug use and inappropriate sexual relations with them. The agency has been thrust into the spotlight since the April 20 explosion of the drill rig Deepwater Horizon that triggered the worst oil spill in U.S. history. As much as 60,000 barrels (2.5 million gallons) of oil may be gushing into the Gulf every day, government estimates found last week. Approximately 23,290 barrels of oil -- slightly more than 978,000 gallons -- were collected from the ruptured well in the 24-hour period ending at midnight Sunday, Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen said Monday. ""The BP oil spill has underscored the need for stronger oversight of offshore oil and gas operations, more tools and resources for aggressive enforcement, and a more effective structure for the agency that holds companies accountable,"" Bromwich said in a statement Monday. ""We will move quickly and responsibly on our reforms."" Also Monday, a federal judge in New Orleans said he is set to rule within the next two days on whether to lift the Interior Department-ordered moratorium on deepwater drilling. U.S. District Court Judge Martin Feldman said he will issue his decision between early Tuesday and Wednesday afternoon on whether to issue a preliminary injunction against the temporary ban. The six-month moratorium, instituted by the government last month, halts all drilling in more than 500 feet of water and prevents new permits from being issued. Backers say it is necessary while a safety review is conducted after the Deepwater Horizon explosion. Opponents dispute its necessity and call it economically devastating in a region that is already reeling. Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC, a company that provides boats and equipment to the offshore drilling industry, says in the lawsuit that the government has no evidence that existing operations pose a threat to the Gulf of Mexico. Hornbeck and other oil service companies named as plaintiffs in the case say they want a court to declare the moratorium invalid and unenforceable. The office of Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has filed a friend of the court brief in support of the plaintiffs. Carl Rosenblum, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said Monday that the moratorium is ""an unprecedented industry-wide shutdown with the stroke of a pen."" ""This is about industry survival for deepwater drilling in the Gulf,"" he said. Rosenblum said the airline industry was grounded for only three days after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Henry Dart, an attorney for the state of Louisiana, complained that Louisiana officials had not been consulted before the moratorium was enacted. ""This is environmental disaster. Let's not make an economic disaster,"" he said. Brian Collins, an attorney for the Justice Department, insisted the suspension was necessary because it ""assures the public time to evaluate safety measures."" BP has agreed to set aside $100 million to compensate oil workers idled by the moratorium, company chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg said last week. A senior administration official told CNN on Monday the White House pushed for that compensation fund. ""We believed we had legal means to push them on funds for workers affected by the moratorium, and they ultimately agreed to set $100 million aside,"" the official said. BP said in a statement Monday that costs from the disaster now total about $2 billion, including the cost of the response, containment, relief well drilling, grants to Gulf states, claims paid and federal costs. To date, more than 65,000 claims have been submitted and more than 32,000 payments totaling more than $105 million have been made, the company said. However, the man overseeing a $20 billion claims fund told CNN on Monday that he wants the claims payment process accelerated and its transparency increased. ""We've got to get the claims out quicker, we've got to get them out with more transparency so claimants understand the status of their claim, and we've got to ease the burden on these folks in the Gulf,"" Kenneth Feinberg said during an interview with John Roberts on CNN's ""American Morning."" Emergency payments, he said, need to go out ""with less corroboration than you would if you're giving a lump-sum payment that is the total compensation. For the emergency payments, we've got to err on the side of the plaintiff."" Critics of the Obama administration have questioned Feinberg's independence, saying he is on the White House payroll as executive compensation czar. That is wrong, Feinberg said: ""I'm not on the payroll. I'm doing the White House pay czar role pro bono, without compensation. ... I don't think anybody will ultimately question the independence of this program."" BP, meanwhile, continues to struggle with its public relations efforts after the Gulf spill. Company CEO Tony Hayward, who was grilled during an appearance before Congress last week and then strongly criticized for attending a yacht race over the weekend, will not attend Tuesday's World National Oil Companies Congress in London, according to a BP spokesman. The spokesman cited Hayward's ""commitment to the Gulf of Mexico relief effort"" as the reason for his decision not to attend the meeting.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- A Kuwaiti company that has been paid more than $8.5 billion to supply food and other items to the U.S. military in the Middle East has been indicted on multiple federal fraud charges, authorities announced Monday. Public Warehousing Company KSC is charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, committing major fraud against the United States, making false statements, submitting false claims and wire fraud, a six-count indictment states. The company obtained contracts in May 2003, February 2005 and July 2005 to feed U.S. troops in Iraq, Kuwait and Jordan, said the U.S. attorney's office for the Northern District of Georgia, where the charges were filed. ""This indictment is the result of a multiyear probe into abuses in vendor contracts in the Middle East involving the illegal inflation of prices in contracts to feed our troops,"" said F. Gentry Shelnutt, who is serving as acting U.S. attorney on the case. ""The indictment alleges PWC submitted false information and manipulated prices to overcharge for food."" Public Warehousing Company, also known as Agility, did not return a telephone message Monday. The charges came after federal officials joined a 2005 whistle-blower suit by Kamal Mustafa al-Sultan, the owner of a Kuwaiti company that had partnered with Public Warehousing to submit a proposal on the food supply contracts, the Justice Department said. The case remained under seal to let federal officials investigate the allegations and determine whether the U.S. government would join the lawsuit. The whistle-blower's civil complaint was filed in Atlanta. According to the indictment, the company violated the False Claims Act by presenting false claims for payment, overcharging for locally available fresh fruits and vegetables, and failing to pass along to the U.S. government rebates and discounts it had obtained, as required by its contracts. The indictment does not say how much the United States was allegedly defrauded, because the investigation is under way, officials said. The investigation is being conducted by a team from the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the FBI, the Army Criminal Investigation Command, auditors from the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Department. ""The defendants, tempted by monetary gain, betrayed the trust invested in them by the U.S. Army and now they must face the consequences,"" said Brig. Gen.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A MoveOn.org political advertisement that criticized the top U.S. commander in Iraq was ""disgusting,"" President Bush said Thursday, accusing Democrats of being afraid to criticize the anti-war group. Gen. David Petraeus testifies on Capitol Hill last week about the so-called surge in Iraq. Bush told reporters at a White House news conference that MoveOn.org's ad in The New York Times about Gen. David Petraeus was a ""sorry deal."" The September 10 full-page ad was titled ""General Petraeus or General Betray Us?"" ""I felt like the ad was an attack, not only on Gen. Petraeus, but on the U.S. military,"" Bush said. ""And I was disappointed that not more leaders in the Democratic Party spoke out strongly against that kind of ad."" Bush said that ""most Democrats are afraid of irritating a left-wing group like MoveOn.org"" and they ""are more afraid of irritating them than they are of irritating the United States military.""   Watch Bush condemn the MoveOn.org ad » . He said, ""It's one thing to attack me. It's another thing to attack somebody like Gen. Petraeus."" Many Democratic lawmakers immediately criticized the ad after it was published. Eli Pariser, executive director of MoveOn.org, reacted quickly to Bush's comments. ""What's disgusting is that the president has more interest in political attacks than developing an exit strategy to get our troops out of Iraq and end this awful war,"" Pariser said. ""The president has no credibility on Iraq: He lied repeatedly to the American people to get us into the war. Most Americans oppose the war and want us to get out."" MoveOn.org and other war critics have accused Petraeus and the Bush administration of ""cherry-picking"" data to make it seem that military success is being achieved in Iraq. During testimony last week before Congress, Petraeus and Ryan Crocker, U.S. ambassador to Iraq, said they believed the U.S. troop increase in Iraq has had some success, an assertion that critics of the war have questioned. A Senate GOP amendment to repudiate the MoveOn.org ad passed Thursday 72-25 as Republicans tried to force Democrats to distance themselves, on the record, from the controversy. GOP Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said the amendment ""gives our colleagues a chance to distance themselves from these despicable tactics, distance themselves from the notion that some group literally has them on a leash, like a puppet on a string."" Among Democratic presidential candidates, Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York and Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut voted against the resolution. Sens. Joe Biden of Delaware and Barack Obama of Illinois didn't vote. The Democrats on Thursday failed to pass their resolution. It included a condemnation of the ""unwarranted personal attack"" on Petraeus, but also condemned ""personal attacks""  that happened in 2002 against then-Democratic Sen. Max Cleland of Georgia and attacks in 2004 against Sen. John Kerry. The vote was 51-46, but 60 votes were needed to proceed. The Democrats' amendment was sponsored by Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer of California. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she faults the Republicans for blocking the Democratic resolution praising Cleland, who was wounded while serving in Vietnam, and Kerry, who is a decorated veteran of the Vietnam War. ""The Senate just voted to denounce, condemn, whatever it is, MoveOn for that ad, but at same time, they rejected assaults on those who have served in our military with great heroism -- the Boxer amendment,"" Pelosi said. ""It seems that the Republicans are selective in how they want to honor those who are serving or have served in the military. It was very disappointing, but it was also very telling.""

The new design for the $100 note made its debut during a 10:30 a.m. ceremony at the Department of the Treasury's Cash Room attended by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. ""The $100 note is the highest value denomination of U.S. currency in general circulation, and it circulates broadly around the world,"" according to a statement from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The denomination is popular when large amounts of cash need to be carried internationally. Anti-counterfeiting measures are the main reason the United States has been making changes in currency. The currency changes started in 1996 with the $100 bill, followed by a new $20 bill in 2003. The $50 bill got an overhaul in 2004, and the $10 was redesigned in 2006.

"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN)  -- A Nigerian militant group claimed Wednesday it sabotaged oil pipelines in the country's oil-rich southern Niger Delta, but the country's military denies the assertion. File image of armed MEND militants in Niger Delta region of Nigeria . The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) said in an e-mail message to reporters that the ""major Shell and Agip crude trunk lines in Bayelsa state"" were struck. ""The Agip pipeline which connects the Agip Brass terminal was sabotaged at Nembe creek while the Shell Nembe creek line was done at Asawo village,"" MEND said. Shell said it is investigating reports of an attack on the Nembe creek pipeline and Agip could not be reached for comment. Rabe Abubakar, spokesman for the Nigerian military's Joint Task Force, said ""the militants are telling lies"" and ""there is no iota of truth in what they are saying."" Their claims against the Shell pipeline ""are not true,"" Abubakar said, explaining that explosives were hurled at the pipeline but the explosion was limited and it did not destroy the line. ""There was an attempt by them to blow up an Agip pipeline around 3 a.m., but the soldiers protected the place and the militants fled,"" Abubakar said. Explosives were found on a well and an explosives expert was brought in to remove them, he added. MEND -- which has declared an ""all-out war"" on the government -- demands that more of Nigeria's oil wealth be reinvested in the region, instead of enriching those whom the militants consider corrupt politicians. But fighting has continued despite Nigerian President Umaru Yar'Adua's recent call for an amnesty for the militant groups, an offer that stays open until October 4. Under the amnesty proposal, militants must hand in their weapons and take part in government rehabilitation programs. Also on Wednesday, the military said three people were seized for trying to blow up a pipeline at the Forcados River. But MEND said the military ""arrested two repentant armed youths who approached them to take advantage of the government's amnesty offer."" ""We are learning that there are about 11 of such cases currently languishing in detention inside the JTF headquarters in Warri,"" MEND said. Last month, Amnesty International said that pollution and other environmental impacts from the oil industry in the Niger Delta are creating a ""human rights tragedy"" in which local people suffer poor health and loss of livelihood. Governments and oil companies are failing to be accountable for the problems, Amnesty said in its report, called ""Petroleum, Pollution and Poverty in the Niger Delta."" Covering 46,500 square miles (75,000 square km), the Niger Delta is about the same size as the Czech Republic, according to the United Nations Development Programme. An area of rich biological diversity, the region contains the world's third-largest wetland with the most extensive freshwater swamp forest, according to the UNDP. More than half the area contains creeks and small islands, while the rest is rain forest, the UNDP says. At the same time, the Niger Delta produces the oil wealth that accounts for the bulk of Nigeria's foreign earnings, the UNDP says. Earlier this week, MEND said its fighters had blown up an oil pipeline and captured six crew members of a chemical tanker. MEND is now saying it has released the ship and the military says it secured the vessel. It is not clear whether the three Russians, two Filipinos and the Indian seized remain in custody. MEND told CNN that ""to their knowledge,"" the crew is no longer being held hostage.

""We are particularly pleased that Picasso's portrait of Angel Fernández de Soto realized over 34 million pounds with proceeds to benefit arts culture and heritage in the UK, and that for the first time an auction inLondon has broken the 150 million pound barrier."" But the auction fell short of Christie's expected totals -- between 163 million and 231 million pounds ($242.5 million and $343.7 million) for the 62 works. The Picasso didn't bring in top dollar, but did fall into Christie's expectations, between 30 and 40 million pounds ($44.7 and $59.5 million). Monet's ""breathtaking"" water lily painting ""Nympheas,"" from 1906, had been expected to sell for the same amount, the auction house said, but it failed to make the top ten. Another work by Monet, from 1884, brought in nearly $5 million. Gustav Klimt's ""Portrait of Ria Monk III"" was sold for $27.9 million, and a 1969 Picasso piece, ""Le baiser,"" sold for $18 million. The only other painting to top $10 million was Vincent Van Gogh's ""Parc de l'hopital St. Paul"" from 1889, which sold for $13.4 million. Paintings by Joan Miro, Henri Matisse, Rene Magritte and Auguste Rodin were also sold at the auction. Matisse's ""Nu à la Chaise Longue,"" from 1923, had not been seen in public since the year after it was painted and was offered at auction for the first time, Christie's said. The painting sold for $9.9 million. All of the buyers of the top ten grossing paintings were anonymous.","Picasso painting was top seller .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iranian security forces blamed a privately owned vehicle Thursday for allegedly running into protesters during Sunday's opposition protests on a Shiite Muslim holy day, according to a news agency. ""There were no deaths resulting from a car accident in the Vali-e Asr area. We referred to the fact in our previous statement that a privately owned Patrol vehicle hit a number of rioters on Azadi [Freedom] Street between Roudaki and Khosh Streets,"" said the semi-official Iranian Labour News Agency, referring to a model of car made by Nissan. ""The vehicle was traced by the security forces and the case is being investigated,"" ILNA said. At least seven people were killed Sunday -- the Shiite Muslim holy day Ashura -- as anti-government protests turned violent. The Iranian government denies that any of the deaths were caused by official security forces, but the clashes -- depicted in sometimes grainy and shaky amateur videos -- show a number of protesters with serious and possibly fatal injuries, including some with apparent gunshot wounds. In one video -- shot Sunday, according to the posting on the Web site YouTube -- green-and-white police trucks rush into crowds of demonstrators in Tehran. The protesters scatter in all directions, but one truck drives into a group trapped in a narrow street with a wall on one side and parked cars on the other. The camera follows the truck, which appears to be a police truck, as it backs away, but a person briefly can be seen crumpled in the street where the truck had been. When the camera returns to the spot, another truck drives over the person. Other protesters rush to the downed person's aid. It is not clear whether the person was killed. CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of the video, or another one obtained by CNN that shows a woman who was said to have been killed when hit by a car driven by members of the Basij, the Iranian paramilitary group. ILNA said it released the statement Thursday from security forces ""owing to the fact that a film has been shown by foreign and anti-revolution [news] networks regarding a vehicle similar to those used by Security Forces being involved in hitting a man at the Vali-e Asr Square."" ""Since the film may be a fake, which is the way foreign and anti-revolution media work, the case is being investigated."" Iran's chief prosecutor, Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi, told reporters this week that seven people where killed in Sunday's clashes on the holiday of Ashura. Most died after being struck with ""hard objects or due to similar causes,"" Dolatabadi said. Opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi's nephew, Seyyed Ali Moussavi, died from a gunshot wound on Sunday. The elder Moussavi's Web site said he was killed during the demonstrations, but state-run news agencies said that Moussavi's death was not connected to the Ashura protests but ""had been planned in suspicious circumstances."" Sunday's clashes were the worst since opposition protesters took to the streets for days following the disputed June 12 presidential election. At least eight people were killed during those protests. Ashura commemorates the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed, who was killed in battle in Karbala in 680 A.D. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.","Video's posters say it shows Iranian police driving into crowds of demonstrators .

"(CNN) -- Iranian authorities have executed the leader of a Sunni militant group blamed for dozens of attacks in the country, state media said Sunday. Abdolmalek Rigi, who headed Jundallah (Soldiers of God), was hanged after being convicted of committing 79 crimes, including armed robbery, planting bombs and attacks against police and military forces, Press TV reported. Authorities arrested him February 23 when he was on a flight from the United Arab Emirates to Kyrgyzstan, Press TV said. Iran has blamed Jundallah for carrying out deadly bombings, abductions and targeted killings in the southeastern Sistan-Balochistan province, which borders Pakistan. It has accused the group of trying to destabilize Iran with the backing of the West. Jundallah claims it has no separatist aspirations but rather it wants the predominantly Shiite country to stop persecuting the Sunni Balochis who live in the province. The province lies about 700 miles (1,100 kilometers) southeast of Tehran. Iran said Jundallah was behind a suicide bombing in the province that killed more than 40 people -- including several members of Iran's Revolutionary Guards -- in October. Jundallah also is blamed for a mosque attack in May that killed more than a dozen worshippers and injured at least 55 in the province. And in 2007, a car bomb that struck a military bus in the province's capital, Zahedan, was also the work of Jundallah, Iran said. The bomb went off as soon as the bus, which belonged to the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, arrived to pick up military personnel at a barracks. It killed at least 11 Guard members. According to Press TV, after Rigi was arrested, the country's intelligence minister claimed that he had been at an American mlitary base 24 hours before his capture and that the United States had forged an Afghan passport for him. Rigi pleaded guilty to the charges against him and appealed his sentence after asking for forgiveness, Press TV reported. The appeal was rejected. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.","State media: Leader of militant group hanged after being convicted of committing 79 crimes .

"DECATUR, Georgia (CNN) -- Police quietly wait by the front door of the small, brick suburban Atlanta home as investigators tell 48-year-old Lajuana Robinson, a mother of nine, ""I'm going to have to put you in handcuffs."" Investigators take a woman from her Decatur, Georgia, home after her arrest in a truancy case. She's charged with violating her parole in a truancy case because three of her younger children have missed hundreds of days of school combined. While students have always suffered the consequences of playing hooky, parents in DeKalb County, Georgia, are facing one of the more aggressive anti-truancy programs in the country, one where punishment can include time behind bars. DeKalb's program is one of a growing list targeting truancy in U.S. schools, said Jodi Heilbrunn, senior research and policy analyst at The National Center for School Engagement. ""Ten years ago, there weren't too many anti-truancy programs, but now they are springing up like rabbits,"" Heilbrunn said, and ""they come in many varieties."" In some communities, a single school takes on its own problem. In others, like Jacksonville, Florida, and Niagara Falls, New York, the battle is system wide. And New Jersey is about to institute a statewide system, targeting six cities with the worst truancy problems. The DeKalb County program, started in May 2006, was designed to get children from the age of 6 to 16 back in class. If a child has 10 or more unexcused absences from school, parents are referred to an intervention program where they sign a contract agreeing to make sure their children get to class. If they fail to do that, they face the judge. According the county solicitor general's office, around 300 families have gone to court so far.  Watch how a Georgia mother ends up in handcuffs » . Most of the parents who are cited are charged with educational neglect, said DeKalb County Solicitor-General Robert James. Most of those charged plead guilty and get probation, he said. The probation usually involves parenting classes, counseling, and follow-up visits for progress and attendance reports. Parents who violate their probation run the risk of thousands of dollars in fines, and up to 30 days in jail per count. ""We are putting parents in jail, or we are bringing them in orange jumpsuits not just because their children are not in school, but because they got a subpoena or summons to come to court, or to come to a diversionary program and they refused to do so. So this is more about accountability than anything,"" James said. James said it is critical in his county to keep kids in school. The Georgia Department of Corrections found that more than 60 percent of its inmates in 2007 didn't earn a high school diploma, and James quoted an internal survey that found 84 percent of inmates in DeKalb County's jail are high school dropouts. LaTara Tankersley-Jones and Craig Scott, investigators for the DeKalb County Solicitor-General's office, are tasked with locating ""truant"" parents and serving court-ordered summons. Jones and Scott, usually with assistance from local law enforcement, also must arrest parents who have not complied with a court-ordered probation or failed to show up to court in the first place. Scott said arrest is the least desirable option, but ""the bottom line is, we have a warrant and even if the children are there, you're going to have to come with us."" Robinson was no stranger to the investigators. The county had intervened on behalf of her children before, even providing Thanksgiving dinner and Christmas presents last year. The mother had been ordered to be sure her children went to school and to attend parenting classes herself. She had done neither, investigators said, earning herself a night in jail and a face-to-face with the judge the next day. Judge R. Joy Walker presides over the Educational Neglect courtroom. On a recent Friday in October, she handled each of the 80 or so cases before her in a fast, firm, and efficient manner. One by one, each parent, mostly women, has an opportunity to explain to Walker why they are in her courtroom. Investigators Jones and Scott are there as well. They say they hear the same excuses over and over again. ""They can't get up, or they have so many things that are going on in their life that are preventing them from making sure that their kids go to school,"" Jones said. Walker agrees to probation for most of the parents in her court this day, including Angela Harris, who pleads guilty to 24 counts, one for each of the 24 days her child missed school. ""I have never in my 48 years been in trouble, so this is all new to me,"" she tells the judge. ""The state is offering you 24 months (of probation), but if you mess up I'm going to put you in jail,"" Walker replies. Walker has put 15 ""truant"" parents behind bars. Lajuana Robinson is released. But she'll have to return to court another day to explain why her children aren't in school. So far, the success of the DeKalb program has been limited. ""We have seen some small results,"" James said. Attendance has increased by 2 to 3 percent over the past year. ""I am not satisfied by that, but in a school system of over 100,000 kids, you are talking about 2,000  to 3,000 more children attending school than what we had the year before last,"" he said. James says that he has received some interest from neighboring counties about the program and he thinks it is only a matter of time before they adopt similar ones. ""We have a lot of parents who feel we should not be intervening in family business, but it's the law. In Georgia, in DeKalb County, attendance is the law, and we plan to enforce it.""","Georgia county operates aggressive program to keep kids in school .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- In September of 2005, no one could have anticipated what we saw in New Orleans last week. What happened on the football field and parade route after the Saints' Super Bowl victory is amazing and uplifting. But what's happening elsewhere in New Orleans also rises to that standard. Consider the following: . The day before the Super Bowl, New Orleans participated in a historic mayoral election, as Lt. Gov. Mitch Landrieu won a stunning 66-percent of the vote, with unprecedented support among all races. African-American candidates also won down-ballot races with majority white support, casting a blow to the notion that New Orleans politics and culture are mired in racial tension. Just weeks before, federal arbitrators awarded $475 million to Louisiana for the replacement of Charity Hospital in downtown New Orleans which makes way for a multibillion dollar medical corridor that is being billed as the largest development project in the city's history. And in late 2009, a federal judge ruled that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' mismanagement at the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet was the cause for flood damage in the Lower Ninth Ward and St. Bernard Parish following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Damages paid to local governments and residents will exceed $1 billion. These judgments validate many locals' beliefs that the flooding of 80 percent of New Orleans and the billions of dollars in damage were caused more by massive engineering failures than a natural disaster. To that point, the government is working on a $15 billion upgrade to the region's 220-plus miles of levees and flood walls that, when completed, will allow them to withstand a storm with a strength level that occurs roughly once every 100 years. Even today, experts will tell you the levees are better than they were before Hurricane Katrina. Additionally, the population is nearing 80 percent of pre-Katrina levels, in part due to hardworking residents who came back and a new crop of younger, entrepreneurial transplants moving to the city to be part of what is going on here. The New Orleans economy is bearing the recession better than most, evidenced in one of the lowest unemployment rates of any major metropolitan area in the country. Also, the city now has a bond rating that is investment-grade, which should free up access to tens of millions of dollars for infrastructure improvements. One of the brightest spots in post-Katrina New Orleans has been in education. In Orleans Parish, academic performance scores in the school district have risen nearly 25 percent. The school system looks to get a ten-figure lump-sum settlement to rebuild school properties across the city. And with over half of its students in charter schools and a large and influential Teach for America corps, New Orleans has become a laboratory and model for education reform. All of this is not to say that everything is going perfectly in New Orleans. Mayor-elect Mitch Landrieu and New Orleanians still have remarkable challenges to tackle and tough decisions to make -- including reducing violent crime, eliminating blighted housing, continuing to rebuild communities and business, and restoring wetlands that provide much needed storm protection. But there is a unity of purpose (thanks in large part to the Saints) that wasn't there even six months ago. The recovery and rebirth includes citizen-driven reform of local government -- a government once marked by corruption, nepotism, incompetence and the like. New Orleanians voted to consolidate the seven assessor's offices, the criminal and civil sheriffs, and the various levee boards. But most importantly, New Orleanians elected an outstanding man as mayor this past Saturday to lead the next phase of recovery. The mayoral election was nothing short of staggering, and the confluence of the Saints win and the historic mayoral election, lined up for the city's best two days since the Battle of New Orleans in 1815. Landrieu was elected in the primary (there will be no runoff) with 66 percent of the vote, including 63 percent of African-Americans and 70 percent of white voters. To say this broad support is unprecedented would be a gross understatement. Landrieu becomes the first white mayor to govern the majority-African-American city in some 30 years. (His father, Moon Landrieu, was the last white mayor.) And he does it after winning all but one precinct in the primary election. In Landrieu, businesses, congressional leaders, nonprofit organizations and average citizens will finally have a leader and partner in a united city government that promises to restore confidence and get dollars flowing to projects that need them. Add to that the fact that New Orleans will be front and center on the world stage for much of the next decade, hosting a series of national and international sporting events, including Super Bowl XLVII in 2013, back-to-back NCAA Men's and Women's Final Fours, and the Bowl Championship Series National Championship in 2012, among many others. In 2015, the nation will celebrate the 200th anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans. And in 2018, New Orleans' tricentenary will focus not only on the founding of New Orleans but also its successful rebirth 300 years later. You see, the effort to rebuild and recover has been not just an engineering feat to save a city, an entire culture has been at stake. We have our own cuisine, music, architecture, funeral traditions, literature and cultural structure. And as of late, it looks like it will be preserved. More restaurants are in operation than before the hurricane, New Orleanians took home two Grammy awards this past year, and many important cultural sites have reopened recently or are scheduled to reopen soon. The world should take notice. Thanks to the Saints, you're looking. But take a deeper glimpse beyond football at what's going on here. For as challenging a decade as the 2000s were for New Orleans, the 2010s may prove to be the brightest time in the city's nearly 300-year history. The momentum is building. New Orleans is not just coming back and not just on its way back. New Orleans is storming back. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Carville.","James Carville: New Orleans is experiencing a historic rebirth .

"Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (CNN) -- The sight of a baby girl suckling on the breast of her dead mother changed the course of Abebech Gobena's life forever. The year was 1980 and Ethiopia lay in the grip of what would become one of the most devastating famines in its history. Gobena, a devout Christian, was on a pilgrimage to a holy site in the north-east region of the country when she came across the dead mother and her baby, lying amid a sea of people who were starving to death. ""When I was returning, there were so many of these hungry people sprawled all over, you could not even walk,"" Gobena told CNN. ""I had some bread on me, so I tried to feed them. I fed two men. When I reached this woman, she was dead, but the child was still suckling at her breast,"" she continued. ""One of the chauffeurs charged with picking up the corpses said to me, 'I am waiting for the child to die so I can pick up both bodies. I just can't bear to take the child as well while she is still alive,'"" Gobena said. Without a second thought, Gobena bundled the tiny girl into her arms and smuggled her to the country's capital, Addis Ababa. In that instant, she transformed both the baby's future and her own. Haunted by the images of the dying people, it wasn't long before Gobena headed back to the countryside in an effort to source water for the destitute locals. She came across another child in the arms of his dying father. Find out more about Gobena and her orphanage. Gobena told CNN: ""At the end of the day, as we were going home we came upon five people, three of them dead, two alive. One of the men dying by the side of the road said to me, 'This is my child. She is dying. I am dying. Please save my child.'"" Gobena took the baby boy home which posed a threat to her own safety, she explained to CNN. ""It was a terrible famine. There were no authorities. The government at that time did not want the famine to be public knowledge. So I had to pretend the children were mine and smuggle them out."" By the end of 1980, Gobena had taken in 21 children. But her desire to save the young children caused friction in her family. ""My family, my husband gave me an ultimatum, choose the children or choose your life,"" she told CNN. ""My relatives, even my mother said, 'She has gone mad, she should be checked at the mental institution.'"" Gobena continued: ""I was not welcome at home. So I decided to move to some land I had bought with the intention of raising some chicken. I moved into this forest area with the kids."" Thirty years on and Gobena, now more famously known as ""Africa's Mother Theresa,"" is the founder of Ethiopia's oldest orphanage. Gobena's thirty-year legacy means she has raised a generation of Ethiopia's abandoned children, orphaned by the ravages of famine, war and HIV/AIDS. However, leaving her own family was a tough decision for Gobena, who had struggled since childhood to gain an education, job and secure family life. Born in 1938, she was only a month-old when her father was killed during the Ethio-Italian war. As tradition dictated, she was brought up by her father's parents until the age of 11, when she was married off without her consent. Revolting against her marriage, Gobena ran away from home to Addis Ababa, where she scraped a basic education, gained a job as a quality controller and remarried. She told CNN: ""I suffered because of the traditions of the country I was born in. But things have improved. My goal is not to marry them off, but to raise them as adults who can take care of themselves."" Gobena has come a long way since 1980 when she struggled to survive, resorting to selling her possessions and tearing up her own dresses to make clothes for the infants. Now her orphanage, as well as sheltering, also acts as a school, educating over 700 children. But she says: ""I have no regrets. God has helped me get to this point. I always had great faith in God. ""I knew we would survive, even selling small things by the roadside. I am so happy because none of the children died, and all of them grew up.""","Abebech Gobena is the founder of Ethiopia's first orphanage .

"Tampa, Florida (CNN)  -- Dianne McLeod recalls her husband, Stanley, getting so visibly upset when the debt collectors called that she had to take the phone away from him. She believes constant harassing phone calls and other tactics eventually killed him. ""I think they were a major contributor to his death because of the stress and what I saw it doing to him,"" she said. McLeod is suing her mortgage company, Green Tree Servicing, for the wrongful death of her husband. McLeod said she thinks he would be alive if not for the stress caused by Green Tree's debt collectors. She said they sometimes called up to 10 times a day and also called the McLeods' neighbors. ""He would begin to sweat; he would also get very red in the face and complain about chest pains,"" McLeod said. ""We were worried he was gonna have a heart attack right there on the phone."" Stanley McLeod had a heart condition and in 2002 was airlifted to a hospital after a second heart attack. He went on disability and Dianne McLeod says they fell behind about three months on their mortgage payments. This is a message left on the their home answering machine, allegedly by a male Green Tree representative: . ""Stanley McLeod, you need to call Green Tree and get your act together and make your payments on your mortgage and quit playing these games. ""Why don't you have that helicopter pick you up and bring that payment to the office?"" It's a phone call the McLeod family will never forget. ""It was so inhumane to talk to someone like that and to take an event that was traumatizing to him and to make a jest out of it,"" McLeod said. Stanley McLeod died of heart failure in 2005. ""The collection activity did not lead to his death. The claim is meritless,"" said Senior Vice President and General Counsel Brian Corey of Green Tree Servicing. ""We deny that the content, the number or the timing of the calls had anything to do with him dying in 2005,"" Corey said. Debt collection is regulated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which forbids harassing consumers. Companies can be fined $16,000 per incident. This year, as the economy plunged, consumer complaints shot up. More than 45,000 complaints had been received by the FTC through the end of June, up about 20 percent over last year. The Association of Credit and Collection Professionals represents about 5,500 companies in the industry. ""The vast majority are very ethical, caring individuals who look for resolution to problems,"" said Adam Peterman, the organization's director of federal government affairs. ""A bad apple can spoil the bunch too often, so we have to keep pushing that rock up the hill to help prevent that,"" he said. Billy Howard is an attorney who runs the Consumer Protection Division for Morgan & Morgan. Howard represents McLeod and has about 500 similar cases against companies who use what he called ""Tony Soprano tactics,"" a reference to the fictional organized crime leader who was the central character in the HBO drama ""The Sopranos."" ""I think it's frightening because these companies go after people and they utilize tactics people just don't know are illegal,"" Howard said. ""Scare tactics work. They've worked for years. That's how the mafia made so much money. That's how these mafia-like tactics result in so much money. People are scared,"" he said. Howard says one of his other clients had this message waiting on the answering machine: . ""You're a piece of s---. That's why you turned your phone off. Mother f-----. But that's OK. ""You haven't heard the last of me. But if it takes me a year or takes me two, believe me, I will find you. You better move. But if you move, you better move to California, 'cause I do travel. And I like traveling. Goodbye."" And then there was this one: . ""When I see you. I'm gonna f--- you up. I want my money, and I want it now. I hate people who lie to me and abuse my company. ... If you bring my money back, you don't have to worry about me, just disregard my message."" The FTC said it receives more complaints about debt collectors than any other industry. Complaints are also filed directly with attorneys general in all 50 states, which can open state investigations. Of the 45,000 complaints received by the FTC in 2009, the agency opened one investigation. According to FTC officials, their primary role is to be a backstop to lawsuits brought by consumers, which is the primary way to fight the alleged abuse. ""We don't have the manpower to individually investigate all of the complaints,"" said Tom Pahl of the FTC's division of financial practices. ""We try to target the worst actors,"" he said. The FTC urges consumers with complaints to report them to their state attorney general, to the FTC and to consider filing suit against the company they believe is harassing them. Anna Inglett is president and CEO of PHG Financial Recovery Services in Tampa, Florida. ""Those companies that do that will eventually put their own selves out of business. ... We want them gone. We want them all gone,"" she said. But she also said debt collection is an important part of the economy. ""If we did not have debt collectors that helped businesses get the money that's owed to them, then who voluntarily would pay any bills?"" she said. McLeod said she remembers the endless phone calls at all hours of the day and night. ""They did not seem to care. ...They didn't care what they said or how many times they called,"" she said. The trial is scheduled to begin in January.","Dianne McLeod says debt collecting tactics contributed to her husband's death .

"(Ars Technica) -- Wikipedia's ""crowdsourced knowledge"" model has created a spectacular resource, but everyone knows the big caveat: If the data's important, don't trust the online encyclopedia without verifying it first. So how well would a similar crowdsourcing model work for a detailed street-level map of the world? Several years ago, that question led to the creation of OpenStreetMap.org, a wiki-style world map that anyone can edit. Several friends in the UK got fed up with the government's stingy approach to data distribution (Ordnance Survey has crafted ultra-detailed maps of the UK with public funds, but that data must be licensed for private use), and decided to do something about it. The obvious question was ""why bother?"" Terrific maps from Google, Microsoft, and others already had a significant lead and were often free (as in beer) to embed and use. But location services were exploding, and all were premised on mapping data. The lack of any high-quality, worldwide, free, and open-source map remained a problem. ""Most hackers around the world are familiar with the difference between 'free' as in 'free beer' and as in 'free speech,'"" says OpenStreetMap in its list of frequently asked questions. ""Google Maps are free as in beer, not as in speech. If your project's mapping needs can be served simply by using the Google Maps API, all to the good. But that's not true of every project. We need a free dataset which will enable programmers, social activists, cartographers and the like to fulfill their plans without being limited either by Google's API or by their Terms of Service."" A street-level map of the world might sound audacious, but OpenStreetMap has exploded in popularity-after starting with a few friends, more than 250,000 have now contributed mapping data to the project. Soon, the map achieved amazing accuracy, especially in Europe where it originated. Take a look at Germany, for instance, where open mapping has become a craze. The Zoologischer Garten Berlin (the Berlin Zoo) exists in Google Maps, of course, but it has little detail (though it does have satellite maps, which OpenStreetMap lacks). Dedicated locals have used OpenStreetMap's tools to do Google one better by mapping all of the zoo's animals; if you want to plot your visit to the lair of the ""Gro_er Panda,"" you can. Even restroom locations are helpfully plotted. As the map took off, it became clear that something more was needed to truly enable developers. The map data alone was valuable, but how much more valuable would it be to create a mapping platform that could handle commercial loads, provide back-end routing services, handle geocoding and reverse geocoding, and build tools for working with the data and crafting new apps from it? Thus CloudMade was born. After a year of building out the platform (with much of the work being done by Ukrainian developers), CloudMade now has 10,500 developers using its mapping platform. Every week, the platform pulls the newest data from OpenStreetMap, creating something new: the ability for frustrated map users to correct those annoying local errors, then see the changes propagate out to apps within a week. Corrections are made ""by people who know their area,"" says CloudMade VP Christian Petersen. And while one might assume that the bulk of the work being done is in places like the US or Europe, Petersen says that ""67 percent of all the mapping being done right now is outside of those markets."" CloudMade hopes to profit by offering free access to its platform in exchange for a cut of ad revenue from free applications (devs can also pay upfront if they want). Where available, baseline map data was imported from open datasets, like the US government's TIGER data from the Census Bureau. But in many places like Europe, most of the map was handcrafted and began with a blank canvas. The results are impressive: a spin around the map shows fairly detailed work already done on places like Mumbai and La Paz, though truly remote locations like South Georgia island have no features yet. Unexpected challenges popped up along the way. In China, for instance, the state puts tough limits on private mapping. ""Doing business in China is challenging"" says Petersen. And the occasional edit fray breaks out over sensitive maps, such as those depicting the divided island of Cyprus. But Petersen believes that the crowdsourced approach to the underlying data works well-better than commercial alternatives, in fact. ""Passion wins,"" he says, noting that pro mapping companies might send data collectors into an area once a year or so and update their maps even less frequently. When local users are involved, local changes are made quickly. Clean up your neighborhood . The accuracy of the data was put to the test last week when a company called skobbler released a free turn-by-turn, GPS-based map program for the iPhone based on the CloudMade platform. Given the price of competing GPS navigation software, this sounds like a revolution. Sadly, the program doesn't work well. Crashes were common in our testing, response could be slow, and the interface was non-intuitive. Users have given it a two-star rating. Even the official press release featured a telling quote: ""Although we know we're not quite ready to challenge the expensive premium navigation solutions, we'll quickly get there,"" said skobbler co-founder Marcus Thielking. Such problems can be fixed. But there's a deeper issue: will consumers trust a mapping program that encourages them to tap a ""ladybug button"" every time they run into a map problem? (The button sets a flag in OpenStreetMap that locals can use to investigate and correct errors.) Users may balk at helping to create the map they're relying on, but people once said the same thing about Wikipedia. Certainly, the underlying maps are getting a workout; CloudMade says that 7,017 edits are made every hour. The process is addicting. A quick look at my own neighborhood revealed a tiny error-a road mistakenly extended up a private driveway about a block away. I created an account at OpenStreetMap, zoomed into the problem area, and hit ""edit."" A Flash-based map editor popped up, overlaying OpenStreetMap data on a satellite picture of the area pulled from Yahoo. Fixing the area was a simple matter of dragging and clicking, and voila-I had made a small difference in the world. Twenty minutes later, after cleaning up pond boundaries at a nearby park, adding a fire station, and fixing a road that mistakenly drove through some homes, I reluctantly moved on to other things. The map's level of detail is already superb, and editing was enjoyable. Having such a free and open resource on the Web seems like a Good Thing. Now, if CloudMade can partner with some truly outstanding developers and turn out some well-written code, it could soon be an extremely Useful Thing, too.

"New York (CNN) -- Football Hall of Fame linebacker Lawrence Taylor was indicted Wednesday on charges of rape and endangering the welfare of a child, stemming from an alleged sexual rendezvous with a 16-year-old in May, a suburban New York prosecutor's office said. The indictment includes one count of rape in the third degree, one count of criminal sexual acts in the third degree, two counts of sexual abuse in the third degree, one count of endangering the welfare of a child, and one count of patronizing a prostitute in the third degree, according to the Rockland County district attorney's office. It also alleges that Taylor paid the minor $300 in exchange for performing sexual acts, the release says. If convicted, Taylor could be sentenced to up to four years in prison, it says. Taylor, 51, was arrested in a Ramapo, New York, Holiday Inn room on May 6, a few hours after the alleged rape took place, authorities said at the time. Ramapo is about 30 miles northwest of New York City. He was released on $75,000 bail at a hearing on May 6. He was not asked to enter a plea. Taylor's attorney, Arthur Aidala, told reporters after the bail hearing that the former National Football League star ""is denying and preparing to fight each and every one of those charges."" Aidala said ""no violence, no force, no threat, no weapons"" were involved in the case. He noted that the rape charge against Taylor was for consensual sex with a minor, and said Taylor denied it. Ramapo Town Supervisor Christopher St. Lawrence and Police Chief Peter Brower told reporters after the incident that the alleged victim was a runaway from New York's Bronx borough and had been brought to Ramapo by a pimp. The girl texted an uncle after she returned to New York City the next day, and the uncle notified the New York City police, prompting the arrest of Taylor and the alleged pimp, St. Lawrence said. Taylor was cooperative with authorities, he said. Taylor was a 10-time all-pro linebacker for the New York Giants from 1981 to 1993 after earning All-American honors at the University of North Carolina. He played on two Super Bowl champion teams and was inducted into the National Football League's Hall of Fame, which noted that he ""redefined the way the outside linebacker position was played."" However, Taylor was twice suspended by the NFL for substance abuse and battled a cocaine addiction long after retirement, resulting in several arrests and a downward spiral that he chronicled in a 2003 autobiography. After kicking drugs, he worked as a sports commentator and appeared as a contestant on ABC's ""Dancing With the Stars"" in 2009. Brower said police found a bottle of alcohol in Taylor's hotel room, but Taylor showed no sign of inebriation. He said no drugs were found in the room. Mark Lepselter, Taylor's agent, told reporters in May that Taylor was very upset about the charges against him. ""He's worked very hard over the last 12 years to change perceptions about him,"" Lepselter said. CNN's Ross Levitt, Alan Chernoff and Kristen Hamill contributed to this report.","Lawrence Taylor was arrested May 6 after girl's uncle alerted police .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- For me, music is about joy -- the complete release of emotion, exhilaration and all-encompassing freedom. It's so easy for us, especially as classical musicians who lock ourselves away from the world for hours at a time to perfect our craft, to forget that this music is really about others. It's about conveying a message. For me, music is about communication that goes beyond our spoken language and rests deeper in our collective human psyche. Music brings us together. Music equalizes us. In college, I fell in love with biology, especially neurobiology. I was even lucky enough to land a few internships at amazing labs -- one at CUNY Hunter in New York City studying spinal chord regeneration and another at Harvard studying Parkinson's disease. I was fascinated by the brain, and I wanted to become a doctor. But my heart cried out for music. And on a total whim (more like a last chance, really), I took an audition for the Los Angeles Philharmonic a few years later, and I won the job. Learn more about Robert Gupta at TED.com . I was totally and utterly crazy about making music, but I confronted myself a few months into the job. What solid proof did I have, besides the ovations I received, that this music was affecting my audiences the way it affected me? Was I just playing the fiddle because it was something I did well and because I was, well, in love? I felt like I was neglecting a calling as a doctor and a neuroscientist. And then I met Nathaniel Ayers. And I saw a miraculous transformation in a man who was delusional, lost and paranoid. I had witnessed (and conducted) a therapy where the dosage wasn't measured or administered under sedation or struggle, where the treatment opened a channel for human communication and understanding. Music communicated where words had failed; I found a moment in which music transcended medicine. It caused a change, immediate and visceral, in a man who was on the brink of a schizophrenic episode. The music ultimately revealed Nathaniel's brilliance -- as if the music opened the floodgates of a previous life and allowed him to face memories and emotions that may have been either too painful or distant to remember. Nathaniel began to recite Beethoven opuses and Schubert and Haydn catalog numbers. He displayed an intuitive understanding of the violin though he'd never taken a real lesson on in his life. He seemed happy and calm. He was a totally different person than when he had walked into the room. And the way that Nathaniel changed also changed me, as a classical musician, as a voice for mental illness and as a human being. I realized that what really mattered here wasn't the venue or even the type of music or any other type of external factor, but relation. The music equalized Nathaniel and myself. It allowed us to behold each other at our most human level and relate to each other. The music allowed us to communicate at a profoundly honest level, and I understood that this was why I made music. To communicate. To heal. To relate to people at their level through the expression of common, simple human emotion manifested as redemption. Music as medicine. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert Gupta.","Robert Gupta gave up a career in medicine to play violin for the Los Angeles Philharmonic .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United were named the world's most valuable football club for the sixth year in a row in Forbes magazine's annual table. The English Premier League champions, owned by the American Glazer family, are valued at $1.84 billion. Record nine-time European champions Real Madrid are second in the list with a value of $1.32 billion, with Arsenal third on $1.18 billion. Reigning Spanish and European champions Barcelona were fourth, followed by the trio of Bayern Munich, Liverpool and AC Milan, who have 16 European Cups between them. Should San Kroenke buy Arsenal? Forbes tallied income from revenue streams including broadcast deals, sponsorship and ticket sales. Overall, the top 20 clubs saw their average value decline to $632 million from $691 million, with 15 teams seeing their values decline. Juventus and Olympic Marseille had the two biggest increases in value - each gaining 9% on the previous year. United, who claim to have 333 million followers worldwide, will begin a new sponsorship deal with American insurance giants Aon Corporation next season that will bring in $34 million a year over four years, 50% more than its current deal with AIG. ""The club has really established itself as one of the top brands in world sport,"" Peter Schwartz, a business sports writer for Forbes, said in a statement. ""New kit deals and great marketing has seen them maintain their status despite all the problems of the global recession."" Despite their success on and off the field, a wealthy group of United fans, known as the Red Knights, are putting together a bid to buy out the Glazers, who have loaded $839 million of debt onto the club.

"(CNN) -- With home sales falling to five-year lows, homeowners desperate to sell their homes are looking for a little divine intervention. Retailers report statues of St. Joseph are selling briskly. Dawn Hoernemann of Minneapolis, Minnesota, had her one-bedroom home on the market for four months. Every weekend there was an open house. But there were no offers. That's until she took her mom's advice and buried a statue of St. Joseph upside down in her front yard. The next week, she had three offers and her home was sold. ""I couldn't believe it. I don't know what it is about it. It worked. It's some sort of a miracle,"" says Hoernemann. This ""miracle"" has it roots in Catholicism. According to the tradition, burying St. Joseph began hundreds of years ago in Europe. St. Teresa of Avila, a nun in the 16th century, buried a medal of the saint and prayed to St. Joseph to help secure land for a convent. The ritual is said to have worked, and so the trend of burying St. Joseph has caught on. Just ask Phil Cates of Modesto, California. His online retail site, StJosephStatue.com, offers the ""Underground Real Estate Agent"" home-selling kits. For $9.95, the 4-inch statue comes with a burial bag and a burial instruction booklet. There's even an 8-inch version of the statue for larger homes. Sales have increased 100 percent in the past two years, according to Cates. Robert Malhame, who runs Malhame & Co -- a Catholic supply company on Long Island, says sales of the St. Joseph Statue spiked last year. And he expects the trend to last. ""We're probably going to sell over 100,000 this year,"" he says. The biggest demand is coming from the Northeast and the Midwest, he says. Jan Wheelehan, the store manager at a Catholic retail supply store in St. Louis, Missouri, says the statues have been one of the better sellers, with sales increasing 25 percent this year. ""People seem more panicked and there is a hurried-ness to their expression when they come in,"" she says. St. Joseph is even on the auction block. There are dozens of St. Joseph home-selling kits on Ebay. From glow in the dark St. Joseph statues to mini pocket shrines, St. Joseph has a whole new following. Burying St. Joseph statues has its own set of rules, too, although they can vary. Home sellers are instructed to dig a hole near the ""For Sale"" sign. The hole should be three inches taller than the statue itself. The saint should then be facing the direction of the street. Then prayers to St. Joseph should be said before the saint is covered with dirt. Once the house is sold, St. Joseph should be dug up and put in a place of honor in the new home. Some renters have even cashed in on St. Joseph's divine intervention in hopes of getting a break on rent or to have their application accepted. They buried  St. Joseph statues in flowerpots. The statue's feet should either be facing the street or in the direction you want to move, according to Cates. The whole statue-burying process was a bit hard to swallow for Joe Iannacone. His Dallas, Texas, home was on the market earlier this month. Iannacone first heard about the ritual from his godfather. ""I looked on the Web. It was less than $10. So, I said why not?"" recalls Iannacone. Six hours later a young woman walked into the house and made a bid. ""I'm not very religious,"" says Iannacone. ""But that was pretty amazing. I was shocked."" St. Joseph may have made a believer out of some sellers, but for some real estate agents, selling a home isn't the work of a higher power. ""What a crock!"" says Connecticut real estate agent David D'Ausilio. ""As a Realtor I think it's ridiculous. The business has always been simple. If a house is properly priced and properly exposed, it'll attract buyers and it will sell -- St. Joseph or no St. Joseph."" Cates says the statue is more than just superstition. ""It's the idea of getting beyond yourself. It's about hoping and praying for something that is bigger than you are,"" he says. And these days, maybe just a little hope for home sellers isn't such a bad thing. E-mail to a friend .","With home sales falling, some sellers seek divine intervention .

"(CNN) -- The oil spill on the Gulf Coast has states and visitors bureaus working hard to keep the public updated and reassure beach-bound travelers. Here are some of the latest updates from destinations affected by the oil disaster: . Northwest Florida . Oil has affected sections of Pensacola Beach and Perdido Key beaches, according to the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. Photos from the area showed patches of dark, syrup-like oil on the white sand. A health advisory has been issued by Escambia County for parts of Pensacola Beach and Fort Pickens, CNN's Rich Phillips reported. iReport: Share your photos of affected beaches . The beaches in Fort Walton Beach, Destin and Okaloosa Island are open to the public, and the air quality is good, according to the Emerald Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau, which represents the three destinations. ""Depending on the wind direction, tar balls may float ashore in Destin or Ft. Walton Beach later in the week, but cleaning crews are standing by,"" the bureau's website said. Small to moderate-size tar balls continue to wash up on some beaches of south Walton County, but the impact has been isolated, and all 15 beach communities remain open, according to the Walton County Tourist Development Council's website. Meanwhile, small scattered tar balls and oil patches have affected Panama City Beach, but the beaches are open and the swimming is still safe, the area's visitors bureau website said. ""Our sugary white sand beaches are open for the enjoyment of our guests and, as of now, we are seeing only intermittent impact,"" according to the bureau. iReport: A slick trip to Perdido Key . Last week, the Escambia County Health Department rescinded a health advisory that had been issued for beaches stretching from the Florida-Alabama border to the entrance of the Perdido Unit of the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Government officials said that there was no oil sheen or oil slick observed in the water from the high-water mark out to 100 yards from shore. Dime-size to 5-inch tar balls continue to wash up in widely scattered areas of northwest Florida, but all of the state's beaches remain open, according to Visit Florida, the state's tourism corporation. Gulf Islands National Seashore . All of the Gulf Islands National Seashore sites, which are in Florida and Mississippi, are open, the National Park Service's website said. But several spots have been affected by the oil spill. On Santa Rosa Island, crews cleaned up when light mousse -- a frothy oil-water mixture -- made landfall. Significant tar balls washed ashore near Opal Beach. ""Response efforts include the constant surveillance for oil on the water,"" the website said. Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama . Gulf Shores and Orange Beach have experienced significant oiling, according to the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau. ""The beaches are open and visitors are still welcome to sunbathe and walk the beach, but we strongly suggest they swim in a pool or enjoy our many off-beach activities,"" the site said. The Alabama Department of Public Health has issued an advisory against swimming in waters off Gulf Shores, Orange Beach and Fort Morgan, and in bay waters close to Fort Morgan, Bayou St. John, Terry Cove, Cotton Bayou and Old River. Grand Isle, Louisiana . The oil's biggest impact in Louisiana is on the portion of the coast from the mouth of the Mississippi River extending east, according to a state emergency website. ""Most of the Louisiana Gulf Coast, 70 percent, is unaffected by the oil spill and remains open for commercial and recreational fishing,"" according to the Cajun Coast Visitors and Convention Bureau website.

"Paris, France (CNN) -- The French World Cup soccer team appeared to keep their heads down Thursday after returning from the tournament following their surprise first-round exit. Cameras barely caught a glimpse of the team as they arrived back home in Paris and buses whisked the players away. The few supporters who turned up at the airport to see the team were left disappointed when the players didn't stop to give autographs. Star player Thierry Henry met French President Nicolas Sarkozy at the Elysee Palace later in the day and left through a back door, French radio BFM reported. Thierry had requested the meeting before the team left the World Cup, Sarkozy's office said Wednesday. French media slam 'shameful' exit . France was eliminated from the World Cup on Tuesday after a 2-1 loss to tournament host South Africa. The loss followed an apparent collapse in relations between coach Raymond Domenech and his players that saw captain Patrice Evra left out of the match and the team refusing to practice on Sunday. Henry, once France's main striker and a World Cup winner in 1998, was reduced to a minor role in this year's tournament, starting all three matches on the substitutes' bench. A high-ranking French Cabinet minister told parliament Wednesday that the government will probe and audit the nation's soccer federation in light of France's failure to advance at the World Cup and dissension on the team. ""We can only note the disaster with a French team where immature bullies order frightened children, with a helpless coach without any authority, a French Football Federation at bay,"" said Roselyne Bachelot, the French Minister of health, youth and sports. ""That's the reason why the government has decided to take all of its responsibilities by first conducting a profound analysis, an external audit, because those who have failed cannot conduct this analysis."" France, traditionally among the strongest national sides in world football and the losing finalist in Germany four years ago, became one of the first to be eliminated this time around. Striker Nicolas Anelka was sent home after confronting Domenech at halftime during France's 2-0 defeat by Mexico last week. Evra was then involved in a public dispute with the squad's fitness coach on the training ground Sunday and is reported to have led dissent over Anelka's expulsion from the team, with the entire squad boycotting the training session. Adding to the confusion, French team director Jean-Louis Valentin then publicly announced his resignation to the media, while Bachelot attempted to mediate between Domenech and his players. Monday, however, Bachelot told journalists the French players had ""tarnished the image of France,"" according to French sports newspaper L'Equipe. In an indication of the extent to which relations had broken down between Domenech and his squad, the coach on Monday described this players' decision to strike as ""unspeakably stupid,"" and called their actions ""an aberration and an imbecility."" ""Nobody can behave in such a way in the dressing room or elsewhere and high-level sportsmen and women have to lead by example through football,"" Domenech told reporters. France's problems at the World Cup had exacerbated long-standing dissatisfaction with the controversial Domenech, who is due to step down as national coach after the tournament to make way for former World Cup-winning defender Laurent Blanc. The French only qualified for South Africa by virtue of a tight playoff win over Ireland, sealed with the help of Henry's controversial handballed assist for William Gallas' goal. Exit at the group stage in South Africa marks a second successive failure in the opening stages of a major tournament. France crashed out of Euro 2008 without winning a match.","Cameras barely catch a glimpse of team returning to Paris .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama has asked Gen. David Petraeus to replace Gen. Stanley McChrystal as the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, he said Wednesday. Obama relieved McChrystal of duty over disparaging comments the general's staff made about top White House officials in an article in Rolling Stone magazine. Petraeus, a counterinsurgency expert, was the architect of the ""surge"" of U.S. forces in Iraq, which some credit with turning the tide of the war. He was promoted to head of the U.S. military's Central Command in October 2008 by President George W. Bush. Obama said there would be no change in policy as a result of the switch in commanders, but Petraeus and McChrystal have struck different tones in describing the Afghan campaign recently. ""The trajectory in my view has generally been upward, despite the tough losses, despite the setbacks,"" Petraeus told the Senate last week -- a day after fainting while giving testimony. He blamed dehydration when he appeared the next day, June 16. McChrystal had said just days before that the campaign against the Taliban in Helmand province would take longer than he originally planned. Questioned by the Senate Armed Services committee about the difference in emphasis, Petraeus said: ""The conduct of a counterinsurgency operation is a roller coaster experience; there are setbacks as well as areas of progress or successes."" Petraeus will step aside as chief of Central Command to take over as Afghanistan war commander, a senior national security source told CNN's John King. His appointment to lead the U.S. war effort on the ground in Afghanistan requires Senate confirmation. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Michigan, told CNN that he hopes to hold confirmation hearings for Petraeus as early as next week. Obama's decision to replace McChrystal with Petraeus was ""reasonable,"" Levin said. The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee immediately expressed his support for Obama's choice. Petraeus ""is the best that we have,"" Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Missouri, said in a written statement. Sen. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, called him an ""experienced, thoughtful commander who will step in and provide a continuity of leadership."" Petraeus all but literally wrote the book on fighting against guerrilla resistance, overseeing the drafting of the Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual between stints in Iraq. He commanded the 101st Airborne Division, the Screaming Eagles, during the first year of the war in Iraq, according to his official biography on the Central Command website. He then commanded coalition forces and the NATO training mission in Iraq. Petraeus then spent time at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, working on the counterinsurgency manual before returning to Iraq to take charge of the surge. He holds a doctorate in international relations from Princeton University.","President taps Gen. David Petraeus to replace Gen. Stanley McChrystal in Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- Seattle's character and history are closely linked to its waterside location, so it makes sense to start your sightseeing at the Waterfront. Experience the Experience Music Project/Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame. Pioneers first settled in Elliott Bay in the 1850s and these days the Waterfront area is buzzing with restaurants, bars and tourists. Kids will love the Seattle Aquarium (Pier 59, 1483 Alaskan Way), while adults will want to head straight to Pike Place Market (Pike Street). More than just an outstanding farmers market, Pike Place is in many ways the beating heart of Seattle. Browse the farm-fresh produce and traditional crafts, and banter with the infamous salmon-tossing fishmongers, whose tourist-pleasing antics mix market trading with street theatre. After stocking up on snacks and souvenirs, venture further into the historic Pioneer Square neighborhood and check out the totem poles in Occidental Park. There's another totem pole in Pioneer Square Park, carved by the Tlingit natives in 1938, as well as a bust of Chief Sealth of the Duwamish tribe, after whom Seattle is named. Nearby, the Seattle Central Library (1000 Fourth Avenue) is an astonishing glass and steel construction by Rem Koolhaas. Only slightly less imposing is the pink granite structure that is Seattle Art Museum (1300 First Avenue) and the 48-foot ""Hammering Man"" that guards its entrance. The museum is known for its collections of Native American and African art, while Asian art is showcased at the Seattle Museum of Asian Art (1400 East Prospect Street, Volunteer Park) in Capitol Hill. The Olympic Sculpture Park (2901 Western Avenue) is a nine-acre waterfront offshoot of the Seattle Art Museum, with free admission. The city's skyline is dominated by the incongruous, spindly Space Needle, part of the Seattle Center, built for the 1962 World's Fair. To get there, take the monorail, another World's Fair remnant, from the Westlake Center (Pine Street at 4th Avenue). Ride a glass elevator to the 160-meter-high observation deck for an incredible view of the city and its surroundings. While you're at the Seattle Center, take a look at the Experience Music Project/ Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame. The colorfully bizarre building by Frank Gehry looks like a three-dimensional cubist collage of smashed electric guitars, and is Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's eccentric gift to the city. Originally a museum dedicated to Seattle native Jimi Hendrix, the Experience Music Project now has all kinds of rock memorabilia and loads of interactive exhibitions. Tickets include admission to the Science Fiction Museum, which has enough sci-fi movie props to satisfy the most obsessive trekkie. Finally, make time to stroll around the Capitol Hill and Fremont neighborhoods for a taste of the non-conformist ""alternative Seattle"" that brought the world Grunge and made plaid shirts fashionable.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Troubled pop star Amy Winehouse spent the night in a London hospital after suffering a reaction to a medication she was taking at home Monday night, according to her spokeswoman. Amy Winehouse's husband was recently jailed for 27 months. Tracey Miller said she could not say what medication was involved. A statement from University College Hospital said Winehouse had been kept in overnight for observation. She had a comfortable night and was released Tuesday morning, the statement said. London Ambulance Service said it transported the singer after being notified of ""an adult female taken unwell."" Winehouse's spokesman in London, Chris Goodman, told the British Press Association that he had not been told what was wrong with the 24-year-old singer, who is well known for her song ""Rehab,"" describing the singer's reluctance to enter a clinic. The pop singer was investigated this year after a London tabloid made public a leaked home video that showed her smoking something in a glass pipe minutes after she was heard saying she had just taken six tablets of the anti-anxiety drug Valium. Police declined to file charges. The singer has battled drug addiction and spent about two weeks in a rehabilitation clinic in January. Winehouse won five Grammy awards this year -- three for ""Rehab"" as well as Album of the Year and Best New Artist. Winehouse's Grammy winning album, ""Back to Black,"" is still a big seller, recently charting at No. 12 in the UK more than 19 months after its release. Madame Toussaud's London wax museum recently unveiled a wax statue of Winehouse alongside Madonna, Jimi Hendrix, the Beatles, Justin Timberlake, Beyonce and other musicians in the museum's ""Music Zone"" exhibit. On July 21, Winehouse's husband was jailed for 27 months. He admitted to brawling with a pub manager and then offering him $400,000 to not talk about the incident.","Amy Winehouse leaves hospital after spending the night under observation .

"(CNN) -- Pakistan-born Usman Khawaja has become the first Muslim to be selected in an Australian cricket squad -- and could now play against his country of birth in Britain next month. Khawaja, who was born in Islamabad but moved to Australia at the age of four, said he was ""shocked"" at being selected for the two-Test series, which was moved to England due to safety concerns in Pakistan due to last year's extremist attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team bus. ""I was a bit shocked, I had a feeling I was close but that could mean absolutely nothing,"" he told Cricket Australia's official website. ""The feeling didn't really sink in straight away but I've told my family and they're really excited."" Khawaja, who is also a fully-qualified pilot, was named in a strong 14-man Australian side for the series which begins on July 13. The 23-year-old made headlines in 2008 when he became the first cricketer of Pakistani-Australian background to play first-class cricket in Australia, making his debut for New South Wales in an inter-state match against Victoria. He is, however, not the first player from the sub-continent to represent Australia -- Sri Lanka-born Dav Whatmore played seven Tests in 1979-80. National selection panel chairman Andrew Hilditch said Khawaja's inclusion in the squad was down to the player's strong performances at state competition level, which saw him score 698 runs and three centuries last season. ""Usman Khawaja has been selected on the back of some very strong Sheffield Shield performances,"" Hilditch said in a statement on Cricket Australia's official website. ""He is seen by the panel as being capable of batting anywhere in the order in Test cricket, but importantly for this particular series as a top-order batsman who could bat in the top four should the opportunity arise."" Fast bowler Ben Hilfenhaus also returned to the squad after missing out on the tour of New Zealand in March with knee tendonitis. His inclusion is timely, as he is considered vital to Australia's bid to regain the Ashes when England tour Down Under in November. ""Ben Hilfenhaus has successfully returned from injury during the current Australia A series in Queensland,"" Hilditch said. ""Ben was a critical member of our 2009 Ashes bowling group and it is very pleasing to see him back in the Test squad with the next Ashes series just around the corner."" Left-arm fast bowler Mitchell Johnson and wicketkeeper Brad Haddin have also been included after both recovered from elbow injuries. The two Tests between Australia and Pakistan will take place at Lord's in London on July 13-17 and Headingley in Leeds from July 21-25.","Pakistan-born Usman Khawaja the first Muslim to be selected in an Australian Test squad .

"(CNN) -- From ""Mario Kart"" to ""Mortal Kombat,"" last week's Electronic Entertainment Expo made one thing abundantly clear: 3-D gaming is just around the corner. But despite what the game console makers Nintendo and Sony might suggest, gamers may not be ready for another dimension to invade their lives. Thanks to the well-timed arrival of 3-D-ready TV sets and video game systems, though, players may soon have no choice but to welcome the in-your-face medium. Heroes and adventures will be designed to pop from your television screen. There will be no escaping it. Nintendo's handheld 3DS system, for example, will showcase 3-D graphics on a small screen -- without requiring users to wear clunky 3-D glasses. The dual-screened handheld makes the strongest case for the concept yet, thanks to its convenient, affordable (at least, compared to current living room setups) and simple, no-glasses approach to three-dimensional play. It's impressive that the Nintendo 3DS is able to offer genuine 3-D special effects on a 3.5-inch display, which isn't bigger than many smartphones. Meanwhile, the handheld system, which does not have a scheduled release date or listed price, does have a compelling list of game titles, including ""Animal Crossing,"" ""Paper Mario,"" ""Contra"" and ""Final Fantasy."" Familiar Nintendo staples will also reappear on the new system. They include ""Kid Icarus: Uprising"" and ""The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3-D."" Enhanced versions of popular franchises like ""DJ Hero 3-D"" and ""Nintendogs"" are also in the works. The three-dimensional games are restricted to Nintendo's handheld device, however. Sony's PlayStation 3 is the first set-top box to receive a software update that allows 3-D games. And graphics on the system burst from the TV screen like pop-up-book cutouts. The first PlayStation 3 games in 3-D were released on June 10. They include the crash test dummy simulator ""PAIN,"" a futuristic racing game called ""WipEout HD"" and a modern-day ""Asteroids"" clone named ""Super Stardust HD."" A demo of arcade speedster ""MotorStorm: Pacific Rift"" is offered as well. Future 3-D titles such as sci-fi shooter ""Killzone 3,"" ""Crysis 2"" and driving simulator ""Gran Turismo 5"" are also planned. One drawback: All of these PlayStation games require you to have 3-D TV and a set of those stereoscopic, 3-D glasses in order to enjoy the third dimension. 3-D graphics will be coming to two other major gaming systems -- the Nintendo Wii and Microsoft's Xbox 360 -- via two games: ""Batman: Arkham Asylum"" and ""Attack of the Movies 3-D."" Both of those systems require users to wear low-tech, red-and-blue 3-D glasses, which break from the industry standard. You won't see 3-D images like those in movie theaters today on the Wii or Xbox yet. Finally, gamers can also turn to their personal computers for 3-D action. Graphics maker NVIDIA already offers a solution for playing over 400 games such as ""Battlefield: Bad Company 2"" and ""Resident Evil 5"" in 3-D on your PC through its 3-D Vision platform. To do so, you have to own a 3-D video card, monitor and active-shutter glasses. All of these hurdles -- combined with the price burden of getting all of this new equipment -- means 3-D games will have only a small audience for now. Plus, no one is really clamoring for these upgrades. There isn't an outcry among gamers that two-dimensional games are broken, for example. Console makers still have some work to do before the masses will make the switch to three-dimensional gaming.","It's entirely possible that gamers aren't quite ready for 3-D to invade our world yet .

"White Plains, New York (CNN) -- Alleged drug kingpin Christopher ""Dudus"" Coke was extradited Thursday from Jamaica to the United States, where he is to face drug and weapons charges. His extradition occurred two days after he was taken into custody in Jamaica and several hours after he had waived his right to an extradition hearing in Jamaica. Coke arrived at about 7 p.m. at White Plains-Westchester County Airport outside New York City. As a phalanx of armed Drug Enforcement Administration agents and U.S. marshals paraded him in front of about a dozen reporters to a silver SUV outside the terminal, Coke -- dressed in a blue open-necked shirt and black pants, his hands cuffed behind his back -- appeared subdued, a smirk on his face. ""I love the people of Jamaica,"" he said in response to a question from a Jamaican reporter. A DEA agent said he was to be taken to New York City and arraigned Friday in federal court in Manhattan. Prior to his departure from Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston, he said in a statement that he had made the decision to waive his right to an extradition hearing of his own free will, and did so ""even though I am of the belief that my case would have been successfully argued in the courts of Jamaica."" According to a superseding indictment filed in Manhattan federal court, Coke has led a criminal organization known as the ""Shower Posse"" since the early 1990s, with members in the United States, Jamaica and other countries. ""At Coke's direction and under his protection, members of his criminal organization sold marijuana and crack cocaine in the New York area and elsewhere, and sent the narcotics proceeds back to Coke and his co-conspirators,"" the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York said in a statement. ""Coke and his co-conspirators also armed their organization with illegally trafficked firearms,"" the statement said. Coke, 40, is charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine and marijuana and conspiracy to illegally traffic in firearms. If convicted on the narcotics charge, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison and a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison, as well as a fine of up to $4 million. He faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison on the firearms trafficking charge and a fine of up to $250,000. Coke was arrested on Tuesday when Jamaican police recognized him at a checkpoint. Last month's failed attempt to arrest Coke sparked four days of gunbattles between security forces and his supporters in Kingston that left 76 people dead. Coke, who is also known as ""President,"" ""Shortman"" and ""General,"" said he was ""deeply upset and saddened by the unnecessary loss of lives"" and said the deaths ""could have been avoided."" ""Everyone, the whole country, has been adversely affected by the process that has surrounded my extradition and I hope that my action today will go some way towards healing all who have suffered and will be of benefit to the community of Tivoli Gardens,"" a neighborhood where violence erupted, he said. He said his decision to face charges in the United States was made in ""the best interest of my family, community of Western Kingston and in particular the people of Tivoli Gardens and above all Jamaica."" He was leaving his country with ""a heavy heart"" and is ""fully confident that in due course I will be vindicated."" ""Pray for me and God bless Jamaica,"" he said. A Jamaican opposition member, Peter Phillips, noted that since Tuesday's arrest there had been little unrest in Coke strongholds -- the neighborhoods of West Kingston and Tivoli Gardens. The member of parliament and former national security minister attributed the calm to the fact that the government had declared a state of emergency and troops were in the streets. But the U.S. State Department issued a travel alert for U.S. citizens planning to visit Jamaica, updating one that had been issued June 15. ""U.S. citizens are urged to exercise heightened security awareness and maintain a low profile,"" it said. Phillips called for the appointment of an investigative commission to probe whether the ruling Labor Party may have tried to ""prevent and frustrate the extradition request."" Jamaicans deserve to ""understand the activities that took place, and the apparent conduct of members of government on the political and the administrative side,"" Phillips said. ""We need to know if there was an attempt to obstruct justice on behalf of the government."" Newspaper polls suggest most Jamaicans believe the government mishandled the extradition request, he said. ""There are still questions left to be answered,"" he said. ""We need a commission to look at all dimensions of this."" Coke has maintained a heroic reputation in the Kingston slums, with some people comparing him to Robin Hood, Jesus and one-time Colombian kingpin Pablo Escobar. His popularity stemmed from his community efforts, including handing out food, sending children to school and building medical centers. But drug enforcement officials say he deserves to be classified as one of the world's most dangerous drug lords. CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin, Elise Zeiger, Terry Frieden and Brooke Baldwin and Journalist Kirk Abrahams contributed to this story.","NEW: Christopher ""Dudus"" Coke will be arraigned Friday .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The former judge who last year lost a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against a dry cleaners over a missing pair of pants wants his job back. Roy Pearson sued the owners of this dry cleaning business for $54 million over a missing pair of pants. Roy Pearson was not reappointed after his term expired as an administrative law judge in the District of Columbia. He filed a lawsuit Thursday in federal court accusing city government and others of an ""unlawful demotion and subsequent termination."" Pearson was taken off the bench in May 2007, during his unsuccessful $54 million lawsuit against a dry cleaning business, which he accused of failing to meet its promise of ""satisfaction guaranteed."" As an administrative law judge, Pearson would hear cases involving zoning law and certain business disputes. A city panel that decides reappointments had notified Pearson during the controversial lost trousers trial that his status was under review. A source on that panel said at the time that any judge must meet certain standards of conduct ""on and off the bench."" The source, who was among the members of the panel at the time of Pearson's review, said ""a judge is a judge 24/7; whether or not they use good judgment in all aspects of their lives is what we can consider."" The civil case, in which Pearson represented himself, sought punitive and compensatory damages against a small family-owned dry cleaners that once posted signs promising ""satisfaction guaranteed."" A pair of trousers that hung by the witness stand was a featured part of the trial last summer. The owners testified that the pants belonged to Pearson, who denied under oath that they were his. The judge found in favor of the dry cleaners and disagreed with Pearson that the satisfaction promise was unconditional. Pearson petitioned the trial judge for a reconsideration, which was denied. He then filed an appeal with the D.C. Court of Appeals, which will hear his appeal later this year. In court documents made available Friday at U.S. District Court in Washington, Pearson, again acting as his own attorney, relies on what he considers Washington's ""Whistleblower Protection"" law to try to establish illegal retaliation. The trial over the lost trousers generated a storm of criticism among fairness advocates, who accused Pearson of abusing the system. The latest litigation has begun to produce the same reaction. ""He lost his job because he proved he did not have the legal requirements to fill the job, namely a judicial temperament,"" said Darren McKinney of the American Tort Reform Association. Pearson did not return a message left at home. In his suit seeking to regain his job, he also seeks ""compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, in excess of $75,000 from all defendants jointly and severally,"" as well as an unspecified amount of punitive damages ""to be determined at trial."" Efforts to seek reaction from the individuals named in the lawsuit were unsuccessful. No initial hearing date has been set in the civil case assigned to U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Farrah Fawcett's death a year ago was the top story for only a few hours, quickly eclipsed by shocking news that Michael Jackson had died. Jackson arrived in an ambulance at UCLA Medical Center three miles away and just three hours after Fawcett was pronounced dead at another hospital on June 25, 2009. ""It was such an odd coincidence that she and Michael Jackson should die just within hours of each other,"" Fawcett's closest friend, Alana Stewart, said. ""It's just amazing that something like that could happen."" Fawcett might have ""gotten a smile about the attention being off her,"" Stewart said . ""I always had the sense that Farrah would kind of be getting a laugh out of that and saying 'Thank God, they're over there, finally. They're leaving me alone. The paparazzi, the reporters, the news cameras.'"" Stewart is not so understanding about the Academy Awards producers decision not to include Fawcett in their 2010 Oscar tribute to movie figures who had died. ""I was so angry,"" she said. ""I called up the director of the Academy the next day and never thought that he would take my call, and he did take my call. And I said, 'Please tell me this was a horrible oversight.' And he said, 'No, there was a lot of discussion about it, and finally we felt that she was known more as a television actress.'"" Stewart pointed out that Fawcett acted in at least 16 movies. She was nominated for an Independent Spirit Award for her acting in ""The Apostle"" with Robert Duval. One of Fawcett's five Golden Globe nominations was for best actress in the film ""Extremities."" ""I can't imagine why they would have made that decision, and it was just really wrong,"" she said. Fawcett's long battle with cancer was closely followed by fans, thanks in part to a camera carried by Stewart. Fawcett asked Stewart to tape her doctor's visits at first as a way to remember what she was told, but she later decided to make it public. The documentary ""Farrah's Story"" aired just five weeks before her death. The actress, whose hair and face made her a global icon, chose to not hide the ravages of her disease under makeup. ""She wanted it to be real, and she didn't want any window dressing on this battle with cancer,"" Stewart said. ""She felt like she could really make a difference and that she could help others and she could share her experience in this battle with cancer with other people who were also battling cancer,"" Stewart said. Fawcett traveled to Germany to seek alternative cancer treatments not offered in the United States. ""She said to the doctor in Germany one day, 'You know, I'm glad I got cancer, because now I know I can make a difference,'"" Stewart said. Even after her death, she is battling cancer through the Farrah Fawcett Foundation, which will fund research and clinical trials of alternative treatments for anal and pediatric cancers, Stewart said. ""Some of the traditional things in the beginning of her treatment here really harmed her and really sucked the life out of her,"" Stewart said. ""They were so debilitating."" Fawcett searched for ""cutting edge"" alternatives to the chemotherapy that was ""like napalming your body,"" Stewart says. Fawcett's story -- which Stewart also chronicled in her book ""My Journey With Farrah"" -- is about a woman fighting to live against mounting odds of a spreading cancer. It was a spirit that kept her alive, she said. ""The kind of cancer she had and the way it had spread, most people wouldn't have lived as long as she lived,"" Stewart said. ""What's so incredible about her story is that she had this indomitable spirit and this incredible courage, and you know also her sense of humor."" It was a battle that she never thought she would lose, always expecting the miracle, Stewart said. ""She fought until the very last day,"" she said. ""The doctors, the nurses, everyone around her said they had never seen someone fight so hard. And she did not want to give up. Not for one second. Not till the very end."" Stewart, who was at her hospital bedside when Fawcett died, will say little about her last moments. ""I just felt like that was a very personal, private time and I can say that she went very peacefully with just a few people around her,"" she said. ""Ryan (O'Neal) was there, I was there, her friend Mela (Murphy) was there, the nurse and the doctor were there, and that was it."" The ""Charlie's Angels"" actress will be remembered on the anniversary of her death when her closest friends gather in Beverly Hills, California, Friday to cut the ribbon on the Farrah Fawcett Foundation's new headquarters.","Michael Jackson's death hours later overshadowed Fawcett's .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama and visiting Russian President Dmitry Medvedev pledged cooperation on stronger economic ties Thursday, announcing a deal for Russia to again accept U.S. poultry exports and touting U.S. support for Russia's bid to join the World Trade Organization. During a busy day that included White House talks, a joint news conference and participation in a U.S.-Russia business council meeting, the two presidents repeatedly cited strengthening relations between their countries after what Obama called a ""drift"" under the previous administration. Faced with the continuing struggle to recover from the global economic recession, nuclear ambitions of Iran and North Korea, terrorism threats and other major issues, Obama and Medvedev said the world needed a strong U.S.-Russian relationship in the 21st century. Obama called Medvedev a ""solid and reliable partner"" and repeated his commitment to ""resetting, but also broadening"" ties, while Medvedev called for a ""level of economic cooperation in line with the potential"" of the two nations' economies. ""We want this volume to grow"" with each country investing in the other, Medvedev said. ""It's not a one-way road."" Obama called for accelerated talks on Russia's membership in the WTO, a goal of the former communist country in its efforts to fully join the global economy. He noted agreements announced Thursday on energy technology trade and the readmittance of U.S. poultry exports to Russia as signals of Russia's serious intent to become a WTO member. However, Obama offered no estimate of when the country would join the 153-nation group that sets rules for international trade. Russia currently is an observer nation. Medvedev noted that Russia has made progress on preparing for membership including necessary changes in Russian laws and steps on issues such as electronic property. He said some ""minor technical problems"" remain, and he hoped they would be resolved by the end of September. Russia was a major importer of U.S. poultry but banned the product earlier this year in a dispute over the safety of a chlorine rinse used in the United States. On other issues, the two presidents acknowledged they had differences over the situation in Georgia, the former Soviet state seeking NATO membership that disputes the autonomy claim of Russian-backed South Ossetia. However, Medvedev said Russia backed the U.S. goal of a stable Afghanistan, saying that helping to build a secure government and economic growth there would prevent the kind of military quagmire the Soviets experienced in the 1980s. Earlier, the two leaders were joined in a meeting at the White House by Vice President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, national security adviser James Jones, and trade and diplomatic officials. Obama then treated Medvedev to an all-American lunch at what apparently is one of his favorite spots -- Ray's Hell Burger in Arlington, Virginia. Each president had a burger and they shared fries, with Obama paying the bill. Medvedev later joked that the meal might not be healthy, but it tasted good. Last year, Obama made another unscheduled lunch stop at the restaurant with Biden. Medvedev took a technology tour of California a day earlier, visiting Cisco Systems for the company's announcement of a $1 billion investment in Russian projects. He sent his first Twitter message after the meeting. On Thursday, Obama joked that he also had a Twitter account, ""so we may be able to throw away those red phones that have been sitting around for so long."" The red phone is an icon of the Cold War that was first established after the Cuban Missile Crisis. It served as a direct line between the White House and the Kremlin in the event of a nuclear confrontation that required immediate consultation.

"(CNN) -- Desmond Brooks had hoped to major in hospitality and considered attending an out-of-state college. Instead, he's living at home, enrolled at Georgia State University and working full-time for campus security. He abandoned hospitality. Instead he's majoring in business to learn the machinations of the market. This way, he'll be able to help his father run his robot repair business that, like many small businesses, is overcoming a downsize. Chris Singh, a junior majoring in finance and managerial science at GSU, plans to delay graduate school to find work and pay off student loans. In a different economy he'd start grad school right away, he said. In the wake of the recession, the American college experience has decidedly become more career-driven. Students are reconsidering majors or exploring employment options long before they see a diploma. More 2010 graduates have work waiting for them when they graduate than 2009 graduates, but not because they received more job offers. Read hot job spots for the next decade . Last year, 40 percent of seniors who applied for jobs received an offer and only 45 percent accepted them, according to a National Association of Colleges and Employers survey. This year, 39 percent of seniors reported receiving a job offers, roughly the same percentage as the class of 2009, but 59 percent accepted. The classes of 2009 saw graduates from previous years turn down jobs and quickly get better offers in terms of location and pay, said Ed Koc, director of Strategic and Foundation Research for NACE. Often, that better offer never materialized for last year's class. ""This year's class had the chance to observe last year's class,"" Koc said. Almost one out of four 2010 graduates who applied for jobs have one waiting for them, a 4.4 percent increase from 2009's class statistics. Those who were most likely to land a job pursued career-driven majors like accounting, business administration, computer science, engineering, and mathematics, according to the NACE survey. Singh took that into consideration when deciding his major. ""Finance is robust,"" he said. ""It's not recession-proof, but it's strong."" Education, physical sciences, foreign languages, English, history and political science had the lowest job offer rates, the NACE survey showed. Engineering disciplines account for eight of the 10 most highly paid degrees this year, surveys have shown. Engineering premiered on the annual list of most popular majors compiled by the Princeton Review this year. Communications has slipped since the onset of the recession in 2007. But surprisingly, some degrees that are not in demand remain popular among students. The top majors according to the Princeton Review's list, respectively: business administration; education; psychology; nursing; biology; English; political science; criminal justice; engineering; economics; marketing; liberal studies; accounting; finance and communications. More graduates planned to work for a non-profit or teach, or attend graduate or professional school in 2010 than 2009, according to NACE. Georgia State psychology major Lyle Brittain said he plans to join the military after graduating to put off joining the workforce. ""My plans haven't changed,"" he said, ""Just the outlook."" Students are also opting for service learning programs -- such as freshman seminars or internships -- earlier in their college careers and more extensively, said Rob Franek, senior vice president of publishing for the Princeton Review. ""Rising juniors and seniors (in high school) are looking for a return on investment that will get them a good career and higher education,"" Franek said. Brooks, a freshman, said he is working with two others within the international business department to learn better management techniques. ""Hopefully I can have an internship next semester,"" said Brooks, whose schedule seems packed already. Choosing liberal arts doesn't necessarily mean joblessness, said Wayne Wallace, director of the University of Florida's Career Resource Center. Students, he said, just need to be more proactive. He said job seekers have to be realistic about their career goals and stay geographically flexible. His advice to college students: stay optimistic and work hard. ""Don't be overwhelmed by the economic problems, Wallace said. ""These things are cyclical. It's going to happen multiple times in your life.""","2010 graduates have more jobs off the bat than 2009 graduates because they accepted more offers .

"New York (CNN) -- A security breach at the Newark, New Jersey, airport over the weekend was caused by an officer of the Transportation Security Administration who left his post unattended, an agency spokeswoman said Thursday. Security video shows the officer walking away from his post at Newark Liberty International Airport, about four minutes after he asked an unidentified man in a light-colored jacket to stay behind the rope line. Moments later, the man ducks under the rope and walks the wrong way through security to greet a woman, prompting a security breach that shut down Terminal C for hours and forced the rescreening of thousands of passengers. ""The surveillance video from Newark Liberty Airport clearly shows that a TSA officer's actions led to the Sunday incident,"" spokeswoman Ann Davis said. ""We will use this hard lesson to reinforce the sharp focus and tight discipline at all our stations across the country and ensure we maintain the public trust."" The TSA officer was reassigned to nonscreening duties Monday after the incident, which occurred at Terminal C about 5:20 p.m. ET Sunday. The unidentified man walked through an exit on the public side to the secure ""sterile"" side, TSA said. Earlier, a Homeland Security official told CNN that the TSA officer was distracted because ""a passenger was asking for directions or something."" The official said it's not uncommon for TSA employees to get ""peppered with questions from passengers every day."" On Tuesday, the TSA officer was placed on administrative leave, the TSA said. Davis has said the agency takes ""full responsibility"" for the incident. She told CNN that a passenger notified a TSA officer Sunday afternoon about a person who he believed had walked through the wrong way at a security exit. The passenger could not provide a description of the person, Davis said. In an attempt to confirm the breach through videotape captured by TSA-funded and Port Authority-installed-and-operated cameras, TSA officials realized the cameras were running but not recording. TSA officials then scrutinized security tapes recorded by Continental Airlines' cameras and confirmed that an ""Asian male"" had breached security, Davis said. The TSA was unable to locate the man. Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, D-New Jersey, who requested the release of the Continental surveillance video, called on the man to turn himself in to authorities, saying, ""You've committed what essentially is a crime."" ""He committed a terrible, terrible offense, and he has to pay a price ... that relates to the havoc and the discomfort he caused this place,"" Lautenberg told reporters at the airport Thursday night. Davis said earlier this week that although authorities were unable to locate the man, any threat he may have presented was eliminated ""by rescreening everyone and recombing the airport to make sure he didn't introduce anything to the environment or hand anything off to anyone."" The incident caused arrival delays, mainly affecting Continental Airlines, the airport's largest tenant. After meeting with the Port Authority about the breach, the TSA has volunteered to check the cameras daily to ensure they are recording, Davis said. Newark was one of the airports from which the 9/11 hijackers departed.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- A military judge Friday found Petty Officer Jonathan Keefe, one of three Navy SEALs accused in the alleged beating an Iraqi detainee, not guilty, a military spokesman said. Keefe was accused of dereliction of duty for not preventing abuse of a prisoner. The verdict comes a day after another of the other accused sailors, U.S. Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Julio Huertas, was found not guilty of dereliction of duty. Huertas was also charged with impeding an investigation by attempting to influence the testimony of another sailor. In graphic testimony delivered in Huertas' court-martial earlier this week, the prisoner, Ahmed Hashim Abed, accused Keefe, Huertas and another Navy SEAL -- Petty Officer 2nd Class Matthew McCabe -- of beating him. Keefe had declined a jury and was found not guilty by a military judge, according to the military spokesman, Terry Conder, Public Affairs Officer for Joint Forces Special Operations Component Command. Huertas was found not guilty Thursday by a military jury. Abed is thought by U.S. authorities to be the mastermind in the slayings and mutilation of four U.S. contractors in Falluja, Iraq, in 2004, one of the war's most notorious crimes against Americans. Last January, a military judge ruled that the trials of Keefe and Huertas be held on a base in Iraq. McCabe, who is charged with assault, will be tried May 3 in Norfolk, Virginia.

"(CNN) -- Prince Albert of Monaco is engaged to former South African Olympic swimmer Charlene Wittstock, the palace announced Wednesday. The 52-year-old prince and ruler of Monaco, the first child of Princess Grace and the late Prince Rainier, has never married. In a 2004 interview with CNN's Larry King, Albert admitted it had taken him ""longer than most"" to find a wife. ""There have been some relationships where, had they gone on a little bit more, they would have headed that way,"" Albert said. ""But I think it's -- it's so much your own timing and your own agenda and the person you want to be with."" Like his fiancee, Albert is also an Olympian, having competed in five Olympic Winter Games -- from Calgary in 1988 to Salt Lake City in 2002 -- in bobsledding. He is a member of the International Olympic Committee and president of Monaco's national Olympic committee. Albert has two younger sisters, Princesses Caroline and Stephanie. The prince and Wittstock have been photographed together many times in the past four years, leading to speculation they would eventually marry. Albert has two children from previous relationships -- a 6-year-old son born to Nicole Coste, a flight attendant from Togo, and an 18-year-old daughter born to American Tamara Rotolo, a former waitress. Neither child is in line for the throne under Monaco law, which says succession passes only to direct legitimate descendants. Albert was formally invested as Monaco's ruler following the death of his father in 2005. Monaco, a sovereign principality, is one of the smallest countries in the world, measuring just under two square miles. It sits on the French Riviera and is bordered on three sides by France, with a population of about 33,000 people.","Monaco's Prince Albert has never married .

"Berlin, Germany (CNN) -- The German Cabinet met Wednesday to discuss ways of tackling child abuse in the Catholic church and other institutions as a new allegation surfaced against a suspended priest. Government ministers discussed the makeup of a round table on child abuse and prevention, set to meet April 23. The government also named a special representative for child abuse matters. Christine Bergmann is a former minister for family affairs and her post should now be a go-to point for victims of child abuse, the government said. The new allegation is against the Reverend Peter Hullermann, who was convicted of abusing minors in 1986. Hullermann's case made headlines in Germany last week when it emerged the archdiocese ignored warnings to keep him away from children when it was headed by Pope Benedict XVI, who was then Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger. A news release from the Archdiocese of Munich identified him only as ""suspended Reverend H"" and says the abuse allegedly happened in 1998 in the town of Garching, near Munich, but Hullermann was the only one serving there at the time who has now been suspended. The statute of limitations on the case has not expired, the archdiocese said. The alleged victim was under age at the time, it said. After his conviction in 1986, Hullermann was given an 18-month suspended sentence and a fine of 4,000 deutschmarks (about $2,000 at the time). But he was then allowed to resume his priestly work and he continued to work with children, even though a psychoanalyst who had examined him demanded that Hullermann never be allowed to interact with minors again. The psychoanalyst, Werner Huth, had regularly done psychoanalytical evaluations for the church and had Hullermann in therapy from 1980 to 1992. Huth told CNN last week he does not believe Pope Benedict was ever aware that Hullermann had returned to service, but Huth said he warned other church officials about the priest's pedophilia many times. Garching Mayor Wolfgang Reichenwallner told CNN the archdiocese never informed him that Hullermann had a history of pedophilia. The archdiocese said the case has been sent to the state prosecutor's office and that no further information will be given. Hullermann was suspended earlier this month as information about his past started coming to light. -- CNN's Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.","Germany's Cabinet discussing ways of tackling child abuse in Catholic church .

"Okaloosa Island, Florida (CNN) -- Vacationers were the first to notice the bird fumbling in the water near this popular tourist beach last week. It bobbed and swayed differently than other birds, and didn't react when humans came dangerously close. Once it was ashore, they could see why: a light sheen of oil covered its feathers. Animal health technician Stephanie Neumann tried to rescue the Northern Gannet, but beach safety officers stopped her. Her coworkers at the Emerald Coast Wildlife Refuge already had stabilized birds and a sea turtle affected by the Gulf oil disaster, but officials wanted to know: Did she have a contract with BP? Could she -- and the bird --wait while they verified her organization's status? ""They're trying to do their job,"" Neumann said as she crouched over the motionless bird, wrapped in a white sheet and barely hidden from the stares of kids and parents. ""They have to make sure protocol is followed."" When brown clumps of tar began to wash up on the snow-white beaches around Destin last week, the mood in this sunny beach community shifted from optimistic denial to furious worry. Local ideas about how to protect the area clashed with plans from BP, state and federal agencies. Community volunteers struggling to cut through protocol cheered a decision by Okaloosa County to defy BP and the feds. They were done waiting. They'd use their own plans. ""This is ridiculous. We'll take the heat. We would do whatever it took to stop the oil,"" said the county commission chairman, Wayne Harris. After months of wrangling with agencies responding to the spill, Harris wasn't willing to stake the county's ecology and economy only on boom that captures or absorbs oil. The commission authorized emergency management teams to add skimmers, barges and extra boom, and an air wall they hope will push the oil away. They plan to layer prevention measures in the pass that connects the Gulf to Choctawhatchee Bay, where fresh and salt water mix and dolphins play. Harris said the plan could cost up to $6 million per month, which he hopes will be covered by money from BP. The county developed its oil plan in the days after the disaster began to unfold, but it was plagued by miscommunications, disagreements and bureaucracy once it left local hands, Harris said. Communities along the Gulf Coast have made similar complaints. Mayors grilled a BP official about the response during a press conference earlier this month. In Magnolia Springs, Alabama, locals went outside the federal plan and risked incarceration by adding boom and barges to protect Weeks Bay. In Pointe Aux Chenes, Louisiana, Native Americans pitched in to string boom near an island where many of their ancestors are buried. Harris said some of his county's efforts may work; others may not. ""Doing something is better than doing nothing,"" he said. On the Okaloosa Island beach, local response to the oiled Gannet was quicker, but the federal response had less red tape to work through. U.S. Fish and Wildlife workers arrived before Neumann's status was verified, so she left their bird in their care. ""Time is essential with these guys,"" she said. ""Every minute counts."" For the rest of Okaloosa County, more boom and barges were starting to appear in the water. The county commission vote was ""smart,"" and sped up the state and federal response, said public safety director Dino Villani, who was quickly invited to an ""olive branch"" meeting in Mobile. Most of the county's preferred plans are moving forward, Villani said, and they'll continue to adapt as the oil moves throughout their waters. Harris said the plans would have gone forward even without approval from BP or other government agencies. ""I'm sure they're cussing. I'm sure they're cussing us bad,"" Harris said. ""If we had waited, we'd still be waiting. Why did it take us giving an ultimatum?"" Charles Diorio, a Coast Guard commander in Mobile, said some communities decided to implement their own plans once they saw they didn't top the list of state and federal priorities, if they were on the list at all. Some just wanted to act before the mess -- and response agencies' attention -- began to move their way. Now that oil is reaching Florida's shores, resources are shifting there, Diorio said, and there's a plan to meet with Okaloosa commissioners this week. ""Now is the time to make sure these relationships are still working and strong and the lines of communication are open,"" he said. The commission's vote marked a turning point for Okaloosa County residents and vacationers. Even as oil crippled fishing, tourism and ecology in Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi, wishful thinkers hoped for the best around Destin, which calls itself the ""World's Luckiest Fishing Village."" ""I'm guilty of it. Every day something doesn't happen, you walk down your beach and don't see it, the feeling gets stronger -- until it arrives,"" Okaloosa County's beach safety division chief Tracey Vause said as he picked gummy tar balls from the sand. ""I was infuriated. It's almost like grieving. This is the destination, white, sandy beaches. Now they're not."" June is typically a busy month along the area known as Florida's Emerald Coast. Beaches in Destin and Fort Walton are usually packed with families freed from school and work, and the water is crammed with boats. But when traces of oil actually arrived last week, clean-up crews were on land and familiar local fishermen wore life jackets, a tell-tale sign they were called into service for BP. Tourist rentals already were down as much as 50 percent, county officials said. Shops were quiet, service jobs were cut back and only a few umbrellas and towels were scattered across the soft sand. No oil-related illnesses or injuries had been reported as of late last week, said Cecilia Wagner, a community health worker for Okaloosa County. A health advisory warned beachgoers against swimming one day last week, but it was lifted hours later. The arrival of oil spooked residents, and made clear the conflicts between local action and BP's response. On the boardwalk at Okaloosa Island, volunteers cleaned up after a group of campers made oil-absorbing boom from hosiery and animal hair. Boom makers Yente Sehman and Barbara Johnson said they'd prefer boom made with renewable resources in the water around Okaloosa County's beaches, and as oil came closer, more materials and volunteers had showed up to help their efforts. In a warehouse nearby, the pair stacked human and animal hair donations funneled through the non-profit Matter of Trust and postmarked from Missouri, Georgia, Massachusetts, Australia and China. Volunteers packed dog and alpaca hair clippings into the legs of pantyhose, then tied them off and strung them into mesh casings with plastic pieces that float in the water. Already, more than 5,000 boom were stacked inside the warehouse. County officials said they don't want to discourage volunteers, but they aren't planning to use the animal hair boom, except as a last resort. Sehman's phone was busy with calls from local business owners and real estate agents who wanted the boom to protect their businesses, but organizers can't give the boom away without county approval and a clear plan for its disposal. ""We live in paradise and everybody wants to believe it's not going to happen to us,"" Johnson said. ""It's turning into anger and frustration. BP, local government, state government, everybody sitting around waiting for someone else to do something. We want to help, but we can't."" Still, the women said they won't stop their boom-making effort, especially as more community members notice the empty beaches studded with tar balls and look for ways to get involved. ""Once we started, no way,"" Sehman said. ""I'm very proud to live in this county at this point in time. People of this county are going to do what they want to do.""","Residents and vacationers in Okaloosa County in Florida are starting to spot tar balls and oiled wildlife on their beaches.
County commissioners voted to respond to the oil spill with their own plans, regardless of whether unified command approved.

"Fairhope, Alabama (CNN)  -- Mark Castlow and Jimbo Meador have a solution for saving the oil-covered birds in the Gulf of Mexico. However, they also have a problem. I saw the solution firsthand during a quick ride through a Gulf inlet, near Meador's home of Fairhope, Alabama, about a 20-minute drive outside Mobile. The two co-owners of Florida-based Dragonfly Boatworks have been working at a breakneck pace for weeks to modify the design of their shallow draft fishing boats, turning them into mobile triage units for pelicans, seagulls, and pretty much any kind of critter caught in the catastrophe. Their concern on the 65th day of the underwater gusher is deep rooted. Castlow, who says he has ""salt water in his blood,"" grew up surfing off Miami and the Keys. Meador, a former shrimper, was raised along Alabama's Gulf shores. They're keenly aware that each day adds to the death toll of birds and other animals dying in pockets of oil that invade their natural habitat. ""We have to do everything we can to take care of them,"" said Meador, who said he has a serious interest in the ""birding world."" ""We want to do try to do what's right to help them because they can't help themselves."" Oil-soaked birds: Rescue or kill? Unlike more traditional boats, which have deep keels that bog down when they push into shallow marshlands, the custom Dragonfly boats can operate in less than a foot of water. Their broad hulls create very little wake that might further alarm wildlife; and they've even been painted a light green color to blend better with their surroundings. On board, Castlow and Meador have added a whole set of tools to help wildlife rescuers: a large, skid-proof worktable for crews to handle animals, an adjustable shade canopy which can be easily lowered to slip beneath bayou tree branches, fine mist nozzles to cool the scorching summer temperatures for workers and critters. The oil won't hamper the boat's engines, thanks to a special cleaning solution. The men consulted wildlife biologists and other scientists as they rushed to make the improvements, and they've found big donors, like Florida musician Jimmy Buffett, who are willing to help them make the boats available to rescuers free of charge. The vessels will be outfitted with wireless Internet access, and plans are in the works to team up with Google Earth to enable anyone to track the boats online in real time. Onboard Web cameras donated by a group in Houston, Texas, will allow classrooms or anyone else to watch rescuers in action. So far, Buffett has funded construction of one prototype boat, according to the duo. The plan is to produce a new boat every seven days from here on out. After the cleanup, the animal rescue groups will be allowed to keep the boats for use in research projects. Clean up crews trample pelican nests . No one will make money off of the deal, but the animals could benefit immensely, including brown pelicans, a species native to the eastern Gulf which has fallen victim to the oil. Brown pelicans spent almost 40 years on the endangered species list until last year. Salvaging just a few of the birds is so vital to the survival of the species, said Lee Hollingsworth, a wildlife adviser with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in Wales. ""Something has got to be done, and of course, it's worth saving the bird."" Brown pelican: Symbol of survival . Every day adds to the death toll of the region's birds and other animals. According to a June 22 report from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, rescue officials have collected 1,746 birds along the coastline from Louisiana to Florida. Of those, 749 were alive and ""visibly oiled."" Another 997 were found dead, and 265 of those were visibly oiled. Birds that were found alive and then euthanized numbered 143. The report states BP's Deepwater Horizon spill is not responsible for all dead birds. How much is a pelican worth? Although the vessels have been praised by wildlife experts, including marine biologists at the University of Southern Mississippi, Castlow and Meador say they've run into dead ends trying to get their boats into the hands of animal rescuers. They've called federal authorities and BP too, but they say no one seems able to willing to tell them how and when the boats might be put to work. Castlow and Meador call their support network the DEA, the Dragonfly Environmental Army, which is made up of those who have extended a helping hand, which include suppliers, donors and volunteers. They're hoping the combined forces of their group can break through the bureaucracy and get their boats in the hands of animal rescuers. It is frustrating to both men, but they say they've been so encouraged by wildlife experts who have universally praised their innovation, that they're pressing on, convinced that no less than the lives of thousands of birds are at stake, and the future of their beloved Gulf too. ""And we're going to get all of these people, and we are going to break that ceiling,"" said Castlow. ""And we will go through it -- because it's our livelihood."" CNN's Katie Ross and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","Mark Castlow and Jimbo Meador develop boat to save oil-covered wildlife .

"(CNN) -- An EF1-scale tornado briefly touched down Thursday in Bridgeport, Connecticut, knocking out windows and ripping signs and awnings off buildings, the National Weather Service confirmed Friday.

The areas affected included several streets near Interstate 95, the National Weather Service said. ""In seconds it just turned black, and you can't see across the street. There was foggy, crazy hard rain,"" said eyewitness Beth Bowman, who was in a downtown bookstore when the twister barreled through. After five minutes of darkness, the weather cleared and the sun came out, Bowman said. The damage from the brief but powerful storm included uprooted trees and overturned U.S. postal boxes, she said.

"(CNN) -- Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick urged a school district to revise its policy allowing students as young as in elementary schools to get condoms if they are believed to be sexually active. ""It is simply not age appropriate to have a program in place for such young children, not to mention not having parents of such young children involved,"" Patrick said in a statement. ""Comprehensive reproductive health education needs to be done in an age appropriate manner."" The policy -- passed this month -- has no minimum age on supplying condoms to students. It allows nurses to give condoms to students they think are sexually active after counseling and education without informing their parents. Provincetown school district superintendent, Beth Singer, who wrote the policy, said she wanted to ensure students of all ages requesting condoms get information on their use. ""Sex has no age limit. It's an individual scenario for each person,"" Singer said. ""We can't put out an age for using condoms."" Singer said the policy is being misunderstood and was never intended for elementary school students. It makes it clear that ""we are against (students) being sexually active,"" she said. The superintendent urged parents to discuss sex issues with their children, including letting them know that abstinence is the only safeguard. A Provincetown school committee voted unanimously for the policy June 10. It was due to go into effect in the fall, but the committee plans to re-examine its wording amid the concerns. Some parents in the school district decried the policy, saying it encourages children to be sexually active. ""This policy is stripping children of their innocence and making them more vulnerable to sexual predators,"" said Sherri Smitt, whose daughter graduated from Provincetown High School. Evelyn Reilly of the Massachusetts Family Institute called the policy ""absurd"" and said it does not give parents a say. ""Sex ed allows parents to make the decision to opt their child out, this policy is essentially saying it's not the parents business if their child is having sex,"" Reilly said. ""It is emotionally, physically and psychologically disturbing."" CNN's Vivienne Foley contributed to this report.","Massachusetts school district passes policy allowing condom distribution .

"Houston, Texas (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's last physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, wasn't the one who gave the pop star a fatal overdose of propofol, according to Murray's attorney, hinting at the defense strategy in the involuntary manslaughter case against his client. ""The fact (of the way) that he died was a mystery a year ago, and still is,"" Houston attorney Ed Chernoff told CNN in an exclusive interview recently. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled that Jackson's June 25, 2009, death was from an overdose of propofol, a powerful anesthesia used to put surgical patients to sleep. Murray is charged with involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death. His preliminary hearing is expected this fall. Murray, hired as Jackson's personal doctor while he rehearsed for his comeback concerts, admits he was giving Jackson propofol as a sleep aid, but Chernoff said the amount was much smaller than what was found in Jackson's body during the autopsy. The toxicology results included in the autopsy report said the propofol level was equal to what would be used to sedate a patient for major surgery. ""There is no way that Dr. Murray pumped Michael Jackson full of propofol sufficient for major surgery,"" Chernoff said. ""No way. I would stake anything that I own on this fact."" Theories of how Jackson might have gotten the fatal dose, other than from Murray, include someone else entering the upstairs bedroom and administering it -- or Jackson waking up and giving it to himself. A anesthesia expert hired by the coroner addressed the possibility that Jackson may have accidentally killed himself with propofol. ""It would have been difficult for the patient to administer the drugs to himself, given the configuration of the IV set-up,"" the expert wrote in the autopsy report. Chernoff said the possibility was not completely ruled out by the expert. ""The coroner's report deemed it to be unlikely, because it would be difficult, so I'm assuming they've addressed that situation and that's what they believe, but is it possible? Absolutely, it's possible,"" Chernoff said. Jackson's personal doctor . Chernoff said Murray had no idea what he was getting into when he signed on as Jackson's personal physician. Murray was reluctant to accept the job despite the $150,000 monthly salary, Chernoff said. ""He was leaving two practices, one in Houston and one in Nevada,"" Chernoff said. ""He was going to be giving up those practices that he built up over 20 years, with no guarantee that when he was done with Michael Jackson he would have his practices back."" Murray knew Jackson had trouble sleeping, but did not know he was using propofol as a sleep aid, Chernoff said. ""Did Dr. Murray know that 'when I get onboard treating Michael Jackson that I'm going to have to deal with this drug propofol?' No,"" Chernoff said. Chernoff said Murray was trying to wean Jackson off an addiction to propofol. ""He wanted to help him do that,"" Chernoff said. ""Who else is addicted to a drug like propofol?"" The anesthesia expert consulted in the autopsy report said propofol was intended for use only in a surgical setting. But Chernoff defended Murray's usage of the drug in a residential setting. ""The fact that medicines may have been prescribed or administered at home -- that alone doesn't make it egregious,"" he said. ""A hospital is just four walls. I can't say he was in over his head, but he certainly was intending to try to help Jackson get off that drug."" The hours before Jackson died . Murray told investigators that he tried for nine hours to get Jackson to sleep the day he died, starting at 1:30 a.m. By 10:40 a.m., after giving Jackson several other sleep aids, Murray said he gave Jackson 25 milligrams of propofol through an intravenous tube attached to Jackson's leg. The doctor's whereabouts during the 90 minutes leading up to when Jackson was found unresponsive are unclear. Phone records show Murray made three calls totaling 47 minutes during that time. Murray told investigators he left Jackson's side for ""two minutes maximum"" while he went to use the bathroom, according to a police affidavit filed in the case. The timing is important because it's the only window when someone else, including Jackson, could have administered the fatal dose of propofol. Prosecutors said the evidence points toward Murray as the only person responsible for Jackson's death. Chernoff said he's confident that a jury will see it differently. ""We get a fair jury and we are able to afford just some of the necessary experts and investigators then, yes, the doctor is going to win,"" he said. ""Whatever the doctor did for Michael Jackson, whatever he did, was to help, and he took the necessary precautions and then something happened that is unexplainable,"" Chernoff said.","Lawyer: Dr. Murray did not give Jackson fatal overdose .
Murray admits using propofol to help Jackson sleep .

"(CNN) -- The maker of Benadryl and Tylenol has added five lots of the popular over-the-counter drugs to its growing list of recalled products, McNeil Consumer Healthcare announced Wednesday in a written statement. Saying the drugs were ""inadvertently omitted from the initial recall action"" of January 15, McNeil disclosed it was voluntarily recalling four lots of Benadryl Allergy Ultratab Tablets (100 count) and one lot of Extra Strength Tylenol Rapid Release Gels (50 count). The Johnson and Johnson subsidiary said customers should call 1-888-222-6036 or use the website www.mcneilproductrecall.com for information on how to receive a refund or replacement product. The drugs were sold in the United States and in Bermuda, Puerto Rico, Trinidad and Tobago. McNeil said the ""risk of adverse medical events is remote.""  Adverse event reports are consumer complaints of a serious side effect associated with the use of a medical product, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Adverse events could include death, hospitalization, disability and other health complications. The products were recalled because of an unusual odor associated with the chemical 2,4,6-tribromoanisole (TBA) that was applied to shipping pallets, the company said. McNeil's other recalls in the past eight months were: . -- In November, five lots of Tylenol Arthritis Pain 100 count with the EZ-open cap were recalled for unusual odor leading to nausea, stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhea. -- In December, the recall was expanded to include all product lots of Tylenol Arthritis Pain caplet 100 count bottles with the red EZ-open cap. -- In January, the recall was widened to an undisclosed number of Tylenol, Motrin and other over-the-counter drugs after complaints of consumers feeling sick from an odor. --In May, 50 children's versions of these nonprescription medicines were also recalled because of quality and safety concerns. Following the pediatric medicine recall, Johnson and Johnson suspended production at McNeil's facility in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, that manufactured the children's drugs. The lot number can be found on the bottle label. The lot numbers for the products recalled Wednesday were ASA202, AJA008, ADA194, ABA022 and ABA264. It was unclear how many bottles were recalled Wednesday. The recalls have affected the availability of the drugs, CNNMoney reports. McNeil spokeswoman Bonnie Jacobs told CNNMoney that ""the pace of restocking is accelerating"" following the January recall. The drug maker expects to be ""at close to normal levels of production toward the end of the second quarter,"" Jacobs said.","Drugmaker recalls five batches of Benadryl, Tylenol sold in U.S., 3 other countries .

"Nogales, Arizona (CNN) -- Mario Morales keeps his Commando assault rifle propped up on the seat of his patrol vehicle. The car snakes along a dirt road about a half-mile from the Mexican border. He's always kept the rifle within arm's reach. But in recent weeks, staying armed at all times has taken on a new urgency: Mexican cartels have issued death threats against the police on the Nogales force. His car rolls to a stop. Morales steps out and points to a nearby hillside where a rusty fence cuts through the desert landscape, separating the United States from Mexico. ""I would not doubt it right now -- we're being watched,"" Morales says. At 51, Morales is a member of the Nogales Police Department's SWAT team. He's patrolled the community since he was 20. Over the past three decades, he's seen this region in southeastern Arizona become a drug corridor for Mexican cartels. Drug runners speed through the canyons, using tree lines to sneak their loot in and out of Mexico. ""They load up and load out, and then they're gone,"" he says. He has relatives across the border, but he hasn't been to family gatherings in Mexico for three years. It's too risky -- an American police officer fetches a high price for cartel kidnappings. ""I've always tried to be careful,"" he says. ""I never underestimate the cartels in Mexico. I take it very serious. I keep a low profile."" The cartel hit men are ruthless, and he says some were trained by U.S. Special Forces to help Mexico fight the drug war, until they went to the other side. ""That is what we're up against."" The recent death threats -- the first ever by Mexican cartels on the police here -- came after two recent busts by off-duty officers. In the first case, two officers were riding horseback when they intercepted a van full of marijuana. A few days later, the same officers were roping cattle with a crowd of cowboys when they spotted a vehicle with bundles of pot being tossed into the trunk and backseat. The off-duty officers detained two men and called in support. ""That was gutsy,"" says Morales. The busts netted about $600,000 in marijuana -- relatively small potatoes in the underworld of drug trafficking. Yet the cartels responded swiftly with a message for Nogales police: When you're not in uniform, you better look the other way or you'll be targeted. The message was relayed to police through an informant. ""They named the Nogales police department officers that were in that area off duty,"" says police chief Jeffrey Kirkham. ""They are not happy, and they are desperate to get that across."" ""We're not going to be intimidated,"" adds Kirkham, the police chief for the last six months. ""We're going to continue with our operations. In fact, we're going to step up our operations."" Nogales, population 24,000, is the largest border town in this region. Its downtown is a vibrant community with a Latino feel. Mexican and American flags hang outside storefronts. A quaint plaza is filled with children and parents alike. Outside of town, homes are built just a few feet from the fence dividing the two nations. Mexican neighbors live directly on the other side. And while the region is a major drug corridor, Nogales has an extremely low crime rate. There has only been one murder in the past three years. By contrast, the police chief says, just across the border there have already been 126 drug-related murders this year. Police say the cartels are being squeezed at the border and the drug lords are angry their profits are being cut into. More than $10 million in drugs have been confiscated in Santa Cruz County this year. And last year, the town of Nogales captured headlines when U.S. Border Patrol agents found a sophisticated drug-smuggling tunnel that went under the border fence. The 60-member Nogales police force has now been told to keep weapons on them at all times. They're even encouraged to wear body armor when off duty. The officers remain in constant communication so their whereabouts are known. ""This is the first time Nogales police officers have ever been threatened by anyone in drug trafficking,"" says chief Kirkham. ""I take a death threat any time against a police officer -- locally, federally or state -- as very serious."" At one point, while Morales is speaking with CNN, he turns down his radio for a few minutes. The department issues an all-points bulletin for him. ""It's very dangerous. You have to be very careful,"" he says. The lifelong resident of Nogales then climbs back into his police car. Dust kicks up along the barren road. The patrols never stop. CNN's Traci Tamura contributed to this report.","Cartel has issued death threats against police in Nogales, Arizona .

"(CNN) -- Alain Bonny knows his mother survived the earthquake in Haiti, but he doesn't know where she is staying right now. Nevertheless, the American college student is going to resist searching for her when he leads a group of students into Haiti in May. ""I'm dying to go to Port-au-Prince right now,"" said Bonny, 22, a Pennsylvania State University senior in chemistry who lost three cousins in the January 12 earthquake. He was told that his mother and other family members moved ""to the countryside,"" but he doesn't know whether she's in a house or under a tarp. Because Penn State's Project Haiti is a student-led organization without chaperones, Bonny is responsible for all 25 people on the trip, ""and I don't feel that [searching for his family] is the best course of action for us."" Bonny said he'll go back on his own during the summer ""to do what I can in Port-au-Prince and to seek out my family."" Project Haiti had planned to visit the Maison Fortune orphanage near the central town of Hinche during spring break in March, but the earthquake forced the group to wait until the week between final exams and graduation. ""It never occurred to me that I shouldn't go. It made me more determined to go,"" said Penn State psychology senior Liz Stock, 21, of Reading, Pennsylvania. ""Originally the plan was to go over spring break, and I'd never had an interest in going anywhere where it was just about lying around and partying, and that's not me at all,"" she added. ""So I wanted to do something that would actually be worthwhile over my break."" Stock's roommate, Kelly Songer, 21, of Emporium, Pennsylvania, desires to bring hope and encouragement to Maison Fortune. Songer, a senior business student, said she wants ""to go there and help children and to see them smile and have them feel like someone loves them and someone cares about them. And also to show them there's more to the world than where they are right now, and they can do whatever they want to do."" Each Penn State student will bring to the orphanage two suitcases stuffed with clothes and other supplies for the children. The group holds fundraisers throughout the school year and a ""packing party"" shortly before departure. Project Haiti was founded in 1997 by the Rev. Fred Byrne as part of the Catholic ministry he led on campus. The project is no longer affiliated with the church, which several years ago reassigned Byrne to an abbey in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. ""I'm a cheerleader on the sidelines,"" Byrne said. ""... Our culture has such a lack of faith in young people, but there's a lot of good stuff happening out there."" Bonny, who will participate in Teach for America after graduation, has been to Maison Fortune twice before. ""We drive into the complex, and all the kids are waiting for us. It's almost like a parade, like we're important,"" he said. ""... It's an absolutely awesome experience. It's like elephants; they will not forget you. And if you make a promise, they will hold you to that. I owe someone an iPod."" Penn State alumna Katie Burkhardt made the trip in 2000 and became president of Project Haiti the following year. She was on a long-delayed return visit to an orphanage in Port-au-Prince with her mother when the earthquake struck in January. ""The ground started to convulse; I thought we were being attacked at first,"" she said. Burkhardt helped the Missionaries of Charity nuns comfort the children and provide first aid to victims before she and her mother got a flight out on January 14. ""It was kind of crazy how it all came full circle. My first time of doing a project in another country was actually Project Haiti, and it just kind of planted this seed,"" said Burkhardt, 29, of Frederick, Maryland. She said all college students should be given the opportunity to serve in another country. ""It's so mutually beneficial. I realized pretty quickly that it wasn't just me helping other people. It totally changed my perspective on the world, and it was such a good lesson to have learned. You can sit in class in college forever and you just don't learn the same kind of things that you would learn in one day in Haiti."" Three students from Lawrence Technological University in Southfield, Michigan, are going ahead with a working spring break in Haiti. ""Since we were already planning to go, we weren't going to let a little earthquake stop us,"" said Melissa Grunow, the school's leadership curriculum coordinator. Students Christine Costa, Christopher Harris and Kevin McLarney plan to arrive March 5 to put their backs into work at an orphanage in Les Cayes for a project called Reconstruction Efforts Aiding Children without Homes, or REACH. ""I know it's a time of need down there, so I can't wait to help out with my services,"" said McLarney, 21, a Lawrence Tech architecture senior from Macomb, Michigan. McLarney, Harris and Costa will help lay the foundations for two structures that will house the dozen girls among the 680 residents of the Pwoje Espwa Sud orphanage. ""I'm excited I have an opportunity to help,"" said Costa, 24, an architecture graduate student from Royal Oak, Michigan. Immediately after the quake, only people with rescue or medical skills were needed in Haiti, but ""by the time we get down there, the next wave -- the rebuilders -- are going to be needed,"" she said. She hopes seeing people coming to help them rebuild will give Haitians hope. The man who created the program agreed. ""Haiti doesn't need a bunch of Americans coming down and doing it for them, they just need some Americans to come down and do it with them,"" said Lawrence Tech alumnus Donald Stevens, the architect and builder who founded REACH after the 2004 Asian tsunami. Harris, a 20-year-old junior from Lansing, Michigan, studying computer engineering, said he has used previous breaks as a pause for partying. But he's up for working in the sun in Haiti. ""They need our help now more than ever,"" he said. McLarney wants the trip to have an impact at home as well as in Haiti. ""I just hope the work I do down there can inspire others to give back to their communities and the world in general,"" he said. ""I think more people need to stop being selfish and give back to the principles that we're all instilled with from birth. It feels good doing good things.""","Penn State, Lawrence Tech students determined to help orphans .

"(CNN) -- A timid judge is a lawless judge. U.S. District Court Judge Martin Feldman, it would seem, is not a timid judge. In deciding to lift the Department of the Interior's six-month moratorium on deep water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, Feldman certainly looks like a decisive jurist. His criticisms of the department's ban were forceful. But Feldman was remarkably selective in his criticism. He was willing to scrutinize the government harshly, but not the oil industry. His opinion made important points about the department's mistakes. He noted that the moratorium affects drilling in water deeper than 500 feet, even though a scientific panel that the department commissioned expressed concern with wells in water deeper than 1,000 feet. He worried that the department had no framework for lifting the moratorium. And he is not wrong to suggest that the moratorium might reflect political rather than scientific judgment. Feldman's opinion also properly expressed concern that the livelihoods of many Gulf residents depend on continued oil production. Feldman, however, did not similarly train his critical eye toward the oil industry. He stated that we cannot conclude that ""because one rig failed . . . all companies and rigs drilling new wells at over 500 feet also universally present an imminent danger."" That is simply false. The accident reveals exactly what the contingency plan is when equipment fails in a deep water rig; the plan is not to have the equipment fail. This is much akin to the Titanic's contingency plan for hitting an iceberg; the plan was not to hit an iceberg. To be sure, the oil companies had complied with regulatory requirements that they file contingency plans. Plans exist on paper, but they are completely worthless. Some of these plans literately call for the hiring of an expert, who is now deceased, in an effort to protect walruses, which do not live in the Gulf. Consequently, we have witnessed two months of BP foundering from one ad hoc scheme to another while millions of gallons of oil pour into the Gulf. By filing a lawsuit against the department's moratorium, oil companies have shown that they do not intend to use this disaster as an opportunity to craft a meaningful response plan based on sound engineering principles. The suit itself shows remarkable hubris in which the oil companies demand the right to continue drilling on federal land, as if nothing had happened. Feldman's decision, unfortunately, might allow them to do just that. Opinion: The case against the moratorium . Feldman had all the facts he needed to judge both the department and the oil companies to be sloppy. He critiqued the department thoroughly. But as to the oil industry, he concluded that ""no one yet knows why"" the Deepwater Horizon rig failed. That is true enough, but we certainly know that no oil company has a sensible means of responding to a deep water blow out. The reality is that drilling for oil in the Gulf is more dangerous than we thought, and more precautions are in order before proceeding. Feldman's sensitivity to employees on the drilling rigs is appropriate, but myopic. A moratorium can force the oil companies operating in the Gulf to craft a realistic plan for addressing a deep water blowout. With a moratorium in place, oil companies have enormous incentives to identify a sound set of contingencies for the kind of accident we have seen that would reduce the flow of oil long before a relief well can be dug. Feldman's lifting of the moratorium is akin to allowing the passenger ships to cross the Atlantic without an adequate supply of lifeboats right after the Titanic sank. Fortunately, the department will likely appeal the ruling, or re-issue it with further justification. Deepwater drilling is and will remain a valuable part of America's energy supply. One-third of domestic oil production comes from the Gulf, and comes from increasingly deep waters. The fact that engineers can devise ways to send a pipe through 2 miles of rock under a mile of water is itself amazing. But such drilling has inherent risks, and oil companies need to use these engineering techniques to develop a coherent plan B before they proceed. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeffrey Rachlinski.","Jeffrey Rachlinski says judge is willing to scrutinize terms of ban, but not oil industry so much .

Oil companies' suit shows they'd like to keep drilling as though nothing has happened, he says .

"(CNN) -- Two-time World Cup winners Uruguay qualified for the quarterfinals for the first time in 40 years with a 2-1 victory over South Korea in Port Elizabeth on Saturday. Striker Luis Suarez scored both goals as the South Americans set up a clash with Ghana, who beat the United States 2-1 in extra-time in Saturday's late game. Uruguay won the first World Cup at home in 1930 and then again in Brazil in 1950. Coach Oscar Tabarez's team were the last to qualify for this year's tournament after winning a playoff against Costa Rica, but are now the first nation to move past the second-round stage. ""We are a country of only three million people, we have been a long time looking forward to something like this and now it's happened -- we are one of the eight best teams in the world,"" Tabarez told AFP. Ghana's extra-time win ends U.S. dream . ""This Korea side played a great match. This confirms how balanced football has become around the world. "" South Korea coach Huh Jung-Moo was proud of his players, having qualifed for the last 16 as the second-placed team in Group B behind Argentina. ""My players never gave up, they were tenacious and rose to the challenge, they showed they were true Koreans,"" he said. ""We wanted to go into the quarterfinals, we had lots of chances. Uruguay were lucky enough to score -- we lost because we weren't able to match them."" Suarez benefited from poor defending to score the opening goal in the eighth minute, but his team conceded for the first time in the South African tournament after a similarly lax effort at the back allowed Lee Chung Yong to level on 68. Uruguay qualify top of Group A . Having sat back after the opening goal, that spurred the Uruguayans onto attack again and the winning goal came with 10 minutes to play as Suarez curled a superb right-foot effort off the left-hand post and into the net. South Korea, seeking to emulate 2002's semifinal achievement after an early exit in Germany four years ago, started strongest but gifted Suarez his second goal of the tournament. South Africa's World Cup dream halted by Uruguay . The 23-year-old, who was in prolific scoring form for Dutch club Ajax last season, had the easiest of chances after the Korean defense allowed his strike partner Diego Forlan put send over a cross which bobbled past hapless goalkeeper Jung Sung-Ryong. Uruguay then seemed happy to allow South Korea to push forward in search of an equalizer, which finally came with 22 minutes to play when Mauricio Victorino's defensive header looped backwards and Lee Chung Yong stole in ahead of goalkeeper Fernando Muslera to head the ball into the unguarded net. France and Uruguay goalless in Cape Town . With the rain lashing down in the Eastern Cape city, Uruguay suddenly stormed back into contention as both Suarez and Forlan missed chances. Suarez made no mistake in the 80th minute after the Koreans failed to clear a corner, with his shot from the left side of the penalty area giving Jung no chance. South Korea had a chance to level when Lee Dong Gook was set up by a fine through-pass from Park Chu-Young, but the striker's weak shot squirmed under the body of Muslera and the danger was cleared by captain Diego Lugano.","Uruguay qualify for the quarterfinals of the World Cup for the first time in 40 years .

"New York (CNN) -- Alleged drug kingpin Christopher ""Dudus"" Coke, who was extradited to the United States from Jamaica, pleaded not guilty to drug and weapons charges in a New York courtroom Friday. He entered a full courtroom at 2:03 p.m. and acknowledged his few family members present with a nod. The judge greeted him with ""Good afternoon, Mr. Coke,"" to which the seemingly calm Coke didn't respond. After entering his plea, Coke stood and answered ""yes sir"" to every question regarding understanding his indictments. The court-assigned attorney told the judge he has not been permanently assigned to case because the Coke family hired attorneys Frank Doddato and Steven Rosen. Doddato is the lead attorney. Coke was extradited Thursday, two days after he was taken into custody in Jamaica and several hours after he had waived his right to an extradition hearing there. Coke arrived at White Plains-Westchester County Airport outside New York City around 7 p.m. Armed Drug Enforcement Administration agents and U.S. marshals escorted him to a waiting SUV. Coke was dressed in a blue shirt and black pants with his hands cuffed behind his back. He appeared subdued, a smirk on his face. ""I love the people of Jamaica,"" he said in response to a question from a Jamaican reporter. Coke, 40, said in a statement that he decided to waive his right to an extradition hearing of his own free will, and did so ""even though I am of the belief that my case would have been successfully argued in the courts of Jamaica."" According to a superseding indictment filed in Manhattan federal court, Coke has led a criminal organization known as the ""Shower Posse"" since the early 1990s, with members in the United States, Jamaica and other countries. ""At Coke's direction and under his protection, members of his criminal organization sold marijuana and crack cocaine in the New York area and elsewhere, and sent the narcotics proceeds back to Coke and his co-conspirators,"" the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York said in a news release. ""Coke and his co-conspirators also armed their organization with illegally trafficked firearms,"" the release said. Coke is charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine and marijuana and conspiracy to illegally traffic in firearms. If convicted on the narcotics charge, he would face a maximum sentence of life in prison and a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison, as well as a fine of up to $4 million. He would face a maximum sentence of five years in prison on the firearms trafficking charge and a fine of up to $250,000. Coke was arrested on Tuesday when Jamaican police recognized him at a checkpoint. He was wearing a woman's wig when he was caught, a federal law enforcement source told CNN. Last month's failed attempt to arrest Coke sparked four days of gun battles between security forces and his supporters in Kingston that left 76 people dead. Coke, who is also known as ""President,"" ""Shortman"" and ""General,"" said he was ""deeply upset and saddened by the unnecessary loss of lives"" and said the deaths ""could have been avoided."" ""Everyone, the whole country, has been adversely affected by the process that has surrounded my extradition and I hope that my action today will go some way towards healing all who have suffered and will be of benefit to the community of Tivoli Gardens,"" a neighborhood where violence erupted, he said Thursday.

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iran will not send a ship carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza as it had planned to do on Thursday, according to a report from the official news agency of Iran.

IRNA said that Sheikholeslam told reporters in the northern city of Rasht that the ship had originally been scheduled to depart for Gaza on Thursday, but that its departure was postponed until Sunday because of restrictions imposed by Israel. He added that officials then decided instead to cancel the trip altogether, shipping to Gaza the goods by other means, IRNA said.

"(CNN) -- North and South Korea marked the 60th anniversary of the Korean War with sober commemorations and sharp rhetoric as tensions continued to ripple between the two countries over the sinking in March of a South Korean warship. North Korea -- which took the opportunity to blame the United States for causing nearly $65 trillion in ""human and material damage"" over the last six decades -- continued to ramp up its rhetoric, accusing America of ""persistently antagonizing"" the country over the sinking of the Cheonan. South Korea blames North Korea for the sinking, which left 46 people dead, but Pyongyang hotly denies the claim. Top South Korean officials on Friday urged the North to stop its provocations as they honored the war dead at ceremonies. The North Korean People's Army invaded South Korea on June 25, 1950, in what would become known as the Korean War. The fighting ended on July 27, 1953, when an armistice agreement was signed. Since there has never been a peace treaty, the Korean War has technically never ended. While there have been efforts over the years to defuse hostilities and pursue peace and stability, great anguish has emerged over the Cheonan, which South Korea says was sunk by a torpedo. At a national ceremony on Friday commemorating the start of the war, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak urged North Korea to stop what he says are military provocations. The Yonhap News Agency quoted him as saying, ""Our ultimate goal is not a military confrontation but peaceful reunification."" In another ceremony in South Korea, Defense Minister Kim Tae-young said, ""the Cheonan incident reminded us of the sad reality of the divided South and North."" Yonhap quoted Gen. Walter Sharp, the top U.S. commander in South Korea, as saying North Korean provocations would be deterred. ""True peace cannot exist when North Korea resorts to force and violence,"" Sharp is quoted as saying. ""The North Korean leadership must know that any further provocations will be dealt with swiftly and decisively."" North Korea's Korean Central News Agency, meanwhile, cited an article in the North's ruling party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, that said the South Korean government is trying to escalate a confrontation with North Korea. ""They are working with bloodshot eyes to ignite a war while crying out for 'retaliation' and 'punishment' of someone with the 'Cheonan' case as a momentum,"" KCNA said, citing the article. North and South Korea presented their cases to the United Nations over the Cheonan sinking recently, with South Korea urging the Security Council to take ""timely and appropriate measures."" North Korea's envoy said that if the ""Security Council releases any documents against us, condemning or pressuring us ... then myself as diplomat, I can do nothing. ... The follow-up measures will be carried out by our military forces."" The U.S. Congress on Thursday recognized the war anniversary and paid tribute to veterans, noting that 37,000 U.S. soldiers died in the war and around 8,000 were reported missing. Around 28,000 U.S. troops are now stationed in South Korea. On Friday, more than 2,500 people gathered at Washington's National Mall to watch a performance by a Korean children's folk ballet in honor of U.S. veterans of the conflict. Although many of ""those brave soldiers are no longer physically with us, they remain with us in spirit,"" said Bo Hi Pak, head of the Korean War 60th Anniversary Memorial Project.  The performance, which included renditions of ""America the Beautiful"" and ""God Bless America,"" was attended by former U.S. House Speaker Dennis Hastert and South Korean Ambassador to the United States Han Duk-Soo, among others. The causes of the Korean War stem back to the 1940s, when the 38th parallel division of Korea occurred and the two newly formed countries became ideologically opposite, with the North as communist and the South as capitalist. North Korea invaded the South in 1950 to achieve its goal of Korean unification under communist rule. Eventually both the United States and China became involved and the fighting eventually ground to a stalemate.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A 20-inch machete from Costa Rica. New power drills with the tags still hanging. A pile of brass knuckles and nunchucks. Tubs of golf clubs, baseball bats and 10-pound exercise weights. An Atlanta TSA officer holds up some prohibited knives surrendered by passengers over the last month. These objects -- collected at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport security checkpoints -- are among millions of items confiscated by the Transportation Security Administration from travelers' carry-on bags each year. After the U.S. government expanded the list of items prohibited on airplanes in response to the attacks of September 11, 2001, air travelers have few options but to surrender their Swiss army knives, cake cutters or whatever banned loot lies in their carry-on bags. Between 2005 and 2006, TSA confiscated 13 million prohibited items, according to a TSA spokesman. On an average month, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the busiest airport in the world, takes 1,000 pounds of items from passengers. Ever wonder where all the junk goes? Guns and firearms -- which are permitted in a traveler's checked luggage but banned from carry-on bags -- are turned over to local law enforcement. The journey for shampoo and other liquids in containers larger than 3 ounces, which were banned on board in 2006 when terrorists attempted to use liquid explosives, is a short one. They are usually immediately disposed of through private waste contractors.  See what Atlanta's airport has collected in the last month » . But the remaining items that possess some value -- knives, corkscrews, electric saws, meat cleavers and wrenches -- are donated to state surplus agencies. They go up for sale at warehouse auctions, retail stores and online Web sites such as eBay, and states keep the profits. Thrifty citizens can expect to buy the goods for cheap -- often just a fraction of the retail price. ""It's not slowing down,"" said Gary Thornton, program coordinator for the Division of Surplus Property in Kentucky. ""We figured the program would last for a few years and property would stop coming in because people should know better, but it hasn't."" Thornton's agency collects leftover contraband items from various airports in Florida, Ohio and Kentucky. State agencies and youth organizations such as the Boy Scouts of America get dibs, for just a few dollars per item, on the 10,000 pounds of airport contents brought to the state each month. The unsold items go on to eBay, where the public can pick up knives and Leatherman multitools, usually for 50 percent off the retail price. For several months, Thornton recalls receiving hundreds of miniature baseball bats from Louisville International Airport in Kentucky. They found a nice home for the bats at the Louisville Slugger Museum and Factory. TSA reports that bats, clubs, knives and blades remain the most popular contraband items passengers try to take onto airplanes without realizing they are illegal. Prior to 2007, cigarette lighters were illegal. Security officers were gathering 22,000 lighters each day before TSA decided to lift the ban so officers could focus on finding  more dangerous items. TSA doesn't profit from any of the collected items, officials said. Travelers have the option to save their prohibited items by transferring the object to their checked luggage or placing it in their car. Passengers can mail the objects back to themselves if there is a post office nearby. But 90 percent of passengers, who are in a rush to catch a flight or don't want the hassle of leaving the security line, just give the items up, says Shekia Gay, a TSA security officer in Atlanta. He said most passengers he encounters are very understanding about leaving behind their belongings, because they know the rules are meant to keep the public safe. But sometimes surrendering items can result in tears. Gay said once a female passenger came through with a set of expensive kitchen knives that was a wedding present. ""She was very upset and distressed,"" he said. ""Her husband had to calm her down, and we kept telling her this is what we have to do."" Eight years after September 11, travelers continue to bring banned items through the airport security checkpoints, despite continuous efforts by the TSA and airports to publicize what items aren't allowed. With more than 2 million passengers screened by TSA on any given day, officers say they are bound to collect prohibited possessions, said Jon Allen, a TSA spokesman. ""A lot of the things prohibited at checkpoints are allowed to go into checked bags,"" he said. ""If there are items people really need, like a baseball bat or power tools, they can put it in their suitcase and it will still make the trip."" Even items that seem obvious to avoid are brought into security checkpoints. A few years ago, Allen said, a traveler tried to bring two gallons of gasoline because he was concerned his car would run out of gas en route from his home airport. Six months ago, a kitchen sink was found in one man's bag in a Washington airport. The gasoline was disposed of. The kitchen sink was put up for sale. Shane Bailey, director of the Surplus Property Division in Alabama, says he has seen some unusual items -- most notably, a samurai sword -- in the six years his agency has been taking TSA's airport junk. The division picks up leftover booty from Orlando International Airport in Florida. Disney World's home airport yields plenty of fake pirate swords, and the TSA does not allow replica weapons, or even decorative belt buckles shaped like guns or plastic toys, to go aboard. Bailey said the swords are donated to nonprofits working with underprivileged children. On occasion, Alabama airport junk sifters will find family heirlooms or valuable memorabilia. The Alabama surplus staff once discovered a knife engraved with the New York Fire Department logo and a serial number. They tracked down the rightful owner and shipped it back to New York, free of charge. ""If there is a way to get the special items back to someone, we'll go that extra mile,"" he said. But some travel critics and passengers say taking their stuff is obnoxious and does little to deter terrorist threats. Eric Weiner, a columnist for WorldHum.com, a Web site about the travel experience, says he thinks collecting junk from passengers just provides an illusion of security. ""TSA knows collecting peanut butter and nail clippers is not really going to prevent a terrorist attack,"" Weiner said. ""It might catch some very stupid terrorist, but not the smart ones.""","Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport collects 1,000 pounds of junk a month .

"(CNN) -- The family of a boy who is believed to have set adrift a balloon in Colorado is known for storm chasing and conducting extreme science experiments together, according to the father's MySpace page. The Heene family, known for storm chasing together, appeared on ABC's ""Wife Swap."" Richard Heene describes himself in his profile as a storm chaser and the host of a documentary series and radio show that investigates  ""the mysteries of science."" The Fort Collins family was also featured on the ABC show ""Wife Swap."" ""When the Heene family aren't chasing storms, they devote their time to scientific experiments that include looking for extraterrestrials and building a research-gathering flying saucer to send into the eye of the storm,"" the show's Web site said. The flying balloon created a wave of worry after officials believed that one of the Heenes' sons had climbed inside before it became untethered and flew away. When the helium balloon finally landed, CNN affiliate KMGH-TV reported, no one was aboard. Officials said Thursday that the boy was found in a box in the attic at his family's Fort Collins home, according to authorities. A neighbor who identified himself as Mark told KMGH that Thursday morning he saw the family outside working on the balloon together.

"(CNN) -- Authorities in southern California said the strong smell of marijuana helped them discover $45 million worth of drugs in the back of a tractor-trailer they had pulled over for a traffic violation. Deputies stopped the truck Wednesday morning, then opened the trailer after finding problems with the paperwork for the load, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Office said Friday. An ""overwhelming odor"" led investigators to about 20 tons of narcotics stashed in pallets in the back of the truck, including about 38,000 pounds of marijuana, 2,700 pounds of cocaine and 67 pounds of methamphetamine, the sheriff's office said in a statement. Sheriff Rod Hoops said Friday night the seizure was one of the largest in the county's history.

"(CNN)  -- A superb goal from Mesut Ozil on the hour mark saw Germany go through to the last 16 of the World Cup with a 1-0 win over Ghana at Soccer City on Wednesday night. The victory also secures Germany's passage as Group D winners and they will now play England on Sunday in Bloemfontien for a place in the quarterfinals. Australia beat Serbia 2-1 in Nelspruit but the effort was in vain as Ghana go through as the second qualifier on goal difference. They are the first African team into the the knockout stages and will face Group C winners the United States on Saturday in Rustenberg. U.S. and England qualify in Group C . Ozil's superb volleyed strike into the roof of the net gave Joachim Loew's men a deserved victory after having the better of the play, but Ghana also chances in Johannesburg. In the first half, Andre Ayew looked set to score as he burst into the Germany penalty area, but he took one touch too many, then Ozil was one-on-one with Richard Kingson, but was denied. Germany captain Philipp Lahm knocked an Asamoah Gyan shot off the line as the teams went in scoreless at halftime, but his team were to eventually triumph. Coach Loew said he had a word with Ozil in the dressing room about his earlier miss and never doubted he would make amends. ""I told him in the half-time break -- you've still got a goal in you,"" he told AFP. ""This was an incredibly intense game and not many things worked out for us. But ultimately we have now reached the next stage. ""The round of 16 game (against England) will be a class encounter, we are looking forward to it."" Australia 2-1 Serbia . Serbia only needed a point in the other match to go through, but were undone by a fighting performance by the Socceroos at the Mbombela Stadium. Two goals in four minutes midway through the second half from Everton midfelder Tim Cahill and substitute Brett Holman gave Australia hope they they could also qualify. But Serbian substitute Marko Pantelic pulled one back with six minutes left, had another ruled off for offside -- the second of the match for his unfortunatle team -- then shot over the bar with the goal at his mercy. Serbia also had strong penalty claims denied as Cahill appeared to handle in his own penalty area. ""This was a game of good quality. I cannot reproach any of my players for their effort,"" Serbian coach Radomir Antic told AFP. ""We had plenty of opportunities but in the end I think that we didn't get fair treatment. We deserved much more than we got. We have to go back home now."" Milos Krasic missed two great scoring chances in the first half and also had an effort ruled out of offside as Serbia dominated, but Australia improved after the break with Cahill outjumping Nemanja Vidic for their opener. When Holman converted with a long-range strike an unlikely passage to the last 16 looked on the cards, but at the final whistle both teams were disappointed.","Germany beat Ghana 1-0 at Soccer City to top Group D at World Cup .

"(CNN) -- Gay pride was on display in towns and cities across the United States Sunday as gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people -- and their supporters -- marched in parades large and small to demand equality, oppose discrimination and express pride in who they are. In New York, the parade featured participants of every age and many backgrounds. Some dressed conservatively, others were decked out in glittering fabrics and some wore next to nothing at all. The atmosphere was festive and open, as marchers carried handmade signs with messages including, ""Straight but not narrow-minded"" and represented groups including the New York Gay Bloggers. But there was no banner for St. Francis Xavier Roman Catholic Church. Parishioners did march, but obeyed an order from New York Archbishop Timothy Dolan that they should not carry a banner with the church's name. The banner they carried was blank. The gay pride parade in Minneapolis, Minnesota, is considered one of the biggest events in the state -- last year's parade drew more than half a million people, according to CNN affiliate KARE. On Sunday, participants wandered in a festival-type atmosphere that included tents for people to sell services and wares. The festival also included a man handing out Bibles and preaching against homosexuality. Festival organizers had tried to block his presence, but a federal court ruled that the man could not be banned from the park.

"Osh, Kyrgyzstan (CNN) -- The flow of refugees fleeing southern Kyrgyzstan has gone from a flood to a trickle, the Uzbekistan Foreign Ministry said. Uzbekistan authorities said even though the flow of people had slowed down they were still dealing with an estimated 120,000 refugees. Aid workers were calling the fallout from ethnic clashes in Kyrgyzstan a humanitarian crisis. No one from Kyrgyzstan's interim government had made official contact  with them since refugees flooded into their country, the Uzbekistan  Foreign Ministry said. Foreign Ministry officials said they were surprised and concerned that they have not had official contact with their neighbor during this crisis. The violence between ethnic Kyrgyz and ethnic Uzbeks had calmed down earlier this week after more than 170 people were killed and more than 1,400 were wounded. But gunfire was heard Thursday from the center of Osh, Kyrgyzstan, a sign that the violent ethnic clashes may be intensifying again. Gunfire in the hard-hit city had been heard only at night. Thursday was the first time CNN producers on the scene have heard daytime gunfights. The clashes, which started last week, were part of the most serious outbreak of ethnic violence in the former Soviet republic since 1990, when hundreds of people died in skirmishes between Uzbeks and Kyrgyz in Osh. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov from London on Wednesday, thanking Karimov for his help with the humanitarian situation, according to a statement from Ban's office. The secretary-general promised assistance to affected people in southern Kyrgyzstan and those seeking refuge in Uzbekistan, and said he intended to consult with key members of the U.N. Security Council upon his return to New York later Wednesday. One U.N. plane, loaded with tons of tents, landed in the area Wednesday and others were on the way. Several countries, including the United States, Germany and Russia, have also sent aid. The International Committee of the Red Cross said along with refugees there was an estimated 60,000 internally displaced people in Kyrgyzstan. Francois Blancy, deputy head of the Red Cross regional office in Uzbekistan, said more aid is needed. ""We are now at the peak of the humanitarian crisis,"" Blancy said.

"(CNN) -- As I sipped Champagne and breathed in the clear icy air of Mammoth Mountain, my boyfriend Matt got down on one knee, offered a glistening diamond ring and asked, ""Sascha Rothchild, will you marry me?"" I was shocked, floored, stunned. I dropped my Champagne and almost passed out. This was my first marriage proposal, but not my first marriage. When Matt suggested our mountain vacation, I had just finished a book tour to promote my memoir, ""How To Get Divorced By 30."" That divorce was from my first, lovable, lackadaisical stoner husband whom I married at age 27. We'd been dating for 3 years when my arbitrary timetable had hit its must-get-married date. He never actually proposed, we just decided one night we would ""do this."" I bought my own engagement ring, choosing something untraditional so if we ever got divorced I could wear it on my right hand. I was planning my divorce while I was planning my wedding. And I did everything in my power to pretend it wasn't really a wedding at all. Three months after the non-proposal, we had a stand-up comedian perform the ceremony in a friend's yard and never uttered the words love, forever, or til death do us part. Eventually I realized I was unhappy and way too young to be stuck in nuptial mediocrity, so I was divorced by 30. Now as I stood with Matt, it dawned on me that this romantic mountain touring spot was private not because we had lucked out, but because he had rented out the whole area. He had spent months having the ring custom made with the help of my sister and he had told my father about his intentions the previous winter. While Matt was planning this proposal fit for a big glossy studio romcom, I was traveling around the country discussing and defending my book about my starter marriage. When asked by interviewers and fans if I would ever get married again, I always answered ""I might get married again, but I won't get divorced again."" Although I had been with Matt for over 2 years and was madly in love, I wasn't focused on marriage. I was focused on enjoying the relationship. Yet another giant difference between what I did wrong the first time, and what I was doing right this time. Second weddings are often small, discreet and sensible. And for a moment after Matt proposed I wanted to run to a courthouse or elope to Vegas, too embarrassed to have another wedding, especially since I had just written a book about divorce. But Matt, who has never been married before, feels strongly about having a real wedding, so I decided to succumb to the juggernaut that is the wedding industry and have a second wedding, which will feel like most people's first. I'm getting wrapped up in trumpet versus mermaid versus princess-cut wedding dresses, in color schemes and bouquet shapes and invitation fonts. I'm enjoying the small moments of making decisions with Matt about venues and open bars and save the date cards. As we plan together we are solidifying our bond, compromising on likes and dislikes, but not to the point that both of us are unhappy. I'm energized by the process as well as reveling in the idea of spending the rest of my life with someone, saying words like love and forever, and wearing an actual engagement ring that's important -- not because it's so damn sparkly and pretty -- but because it was picked out with care and symbolizes something timeless and meaningful. Like many brides-to-be now my days consist of trying on Monique Lhuillier gowns, thumbing through cheesy bridal magazines and wondering about flower budgets. But in between all this wedding planning, I'm signing copies of my book and dispensing advice to distraught readers about the merits of young divorce. It certainly beats staying in an unhappy marriage. I'm giving interviews about why divorce can be a great rite of passage, and why starter marriages, if dissected, can be necessary to fixing one's own flaws and to finding the right person the second time around. I'm on the phone with the wedding planner one minute and then running out the door to a ""single ladies"" author's panel the next. The timing of it all is bizarre to say the least, but somehow totally fitting. Had I not gotten divorced by 30, forced myself to question my failed marriage and then written a book about it, I doubt I would have ever been able to sustain a healthy relationship. I believe in divorce, and I believe in marriage. Perhaps my follow-up book will be ""How To Get Remarried By 35...And Stay That Way.""","While promoting her memoir on divorce, Sascha Rothchild gets marriage proposal .

"(CNN) -- Lady Gaga and President Obama don't often travel in the same circles, but they're the top competitors in a popularity contest that could have one of them setting a record by this weekend. Facebook publicists told CNN on Thursday that the pop star and the president are neck-and-neck in the race to become the first living person with more than 10 million fans on the social networking site. As of early Friday, Obama was in the lead, with 9,058,881 fans. Lady Gaga trailed behind with 9,023,966. Both of them were more than 4 million fans behind the No. 1 individual, Michael Jackson, who had 13,285,811. The singer died a year ago. Obama's page, which is run by the group Organizing for America, includes photographs of his recent Gulf Coast visit and links to speeches from news conferences. His page lists the president's interests as ""basketball, writing, spending time w/ kids"" and says his favorite books include The Bible, Toni Morrison's ""Song of Solomon"" and Shakespeare's tragedies. Lady Gaga's page lists upcoming concerts and includes a biographical article describing how the 24-year-old pop star, who played piano by ear as a toddler, grew into a theatrical performer who wows the masses with flashy performances in international concert tours. ""I'm just trying to change the world one sequin at a time,"" she says in the posted story. Facebook says it has more than 400 million active users. The unofficial popularity contest comes about a year after another internet milestone: a race to attract 1 million followers on the Twitter micro-blogging site.

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Many people are wondering about a federal judge's ruling that is preventing the U.S. government, in the person of Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, from imposing a moratorium on permitting new oil wells or allowing wells in progress to be completed in waters deeper than 500 feet. The lawsuit was filed by Hornbeck Offshore Services, an operator of deepwater supply boats. It was joined by a number of offshore service companies, and an ""amicus"" brief was filed by the state of Louisiana. A similar suit in Texas has been filed by Diamond Offshore, a major contract driller worldwide. The moratorium would suspend all pending current or approved drilling operations for new deepwater wells in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Pacific for six months, regardless of the safety records of the operators and drilling companies performing necessary activities and regardless of the likely economic damage caused to the Gulf Coast economies. For example, the state of Louisiana wasn't even contacted, even though almost half of the job losses that would occur would affect that state. In his ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Martin Feldman points out that the government issued the notice of the moratorium without meeting the minimum requirements set out in the law. He cited two separate laws: the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and the Administrative Procedure Act. His ruling explains that the government report and subsequent memoranda make no effort to establish any irreparable harm to the government that would warrant a suspension of operations. The report and the follow-up memos do not provide a timetable for how long it would take to implement any safety recommendations. The government also didn't provide analysis, required by law, concerning the economic damage likely to be caused by the moratorium. It made no differentiation between shallow and deepwater wells (the 500-foot boundary was added after the Shallow Water Energy Security Coalition pointed out that shallow-water drilling rigs, called jack-ups, use blowout preventers that are mounted at the surface, not at the sea floor). Further, the judge points out that the government misquoted a panel of technical experts, nominated by the National Academy of Engineering and called together to examine the preliminary evidence and make recommendations about how the government should proceed. It turns out that the panel did not sign off on a report recommending a moratorium, a crucial feature that was added by the secretary of the interior after the engineering experts had signed off. Opinion: Lifting ban gives oil industry a pass . The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act is the main law dealing with the offshore exploration and production sector. It calls for the expeditious and orderly development of offshore resources, subject to environmental safeguards, and in a manner consistent with the maintenance of competition and other national needs. The act mandates consideration of the economic, social and environmental values of resources contained in the Outer Continental Shelf. The other law mentioned in his ruling is the Administrative Procedure Act, which provides that agency actions may be set aside by a judge only if they are ""arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion or not otherwise in accordance with the law."" The secretary provided no evidence that he had balanced his concern for environmental safety with the stated policy of making leases available for development or that he considered any alternatives to a blanket moratorium on all drilling. At the end of the day, one deepwater well failed in the Gulf, admittedly in spectacular fashion, resulting in a knee-jerk reaction by a Cabinet secretary who was predisposed to impose a political decision favored by his own party's members. When dealing with national assets and when affecting the regional as well as the national economy, that's simply not good enough. Salazar has stated that he will impose a new moratorium while leaving the door open to correct some of the deficiencies of the earlier version. Meanwhile, the White House has announced an appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court, also in New Orleans, to reinstate the original moratorium, presumably on the grounds that the courts are impinging on the rights of the administrative branch of government. Both actions were predictable. As a practical matter, most analysts are pessimistic that any of the affected rigs will go back to work based on a preliminary injunction. However, the good news is that the injunction will limit the ability of lease operators to declare force majeure in an effort to rid themselves of their multiyear obligations to pay for very expensive drilling rigs. For those not interested in doing the math, that amounts to $3 billion in six months on just the 33 existing rigs. The real key to the puzzle relates to the 33 existing deepwater rigs as well as another eight rigs that are due to begin work over the next 12 to 18 months. Those rigs were constructed based on ""take or pay"" multiyear contracts. These contracts require payment by the operators, whether or not the rigs are actually used. If the contracts are abrogated by federal fiat, the operators, in many cases, will have no choice but to take their business elsewhere. At that point, these assets, each costing $600 million to replace, will move to other international deep water regions, and their owners will sign new multiyear contracts. The result is that, when the government's neophyte commission, after learning something about the industry, concludes its deliberations and announces the conditions under which deepwater drilling will be allowed to resume, they will be preaching to an empty house. In effect, the six-month suspension will become a five-year-plus cessation of drilling activity with all of the concomitant problems of regional depression, increased oil prices, greater import dependency, increased risk of spills -- because additional tankers would be bringing more crude or refined products into the U.S., and tankers have a much worse safety record than do drilling rigs and domestic production systems -- and an ever-worsening balance of payments problem. Oh, by the way, the coastal restoration fund, predicated on the receipt of royalty payments from deep water production, will also be history. For the conspiracy theorists, that may have been the point all along. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eric Smith.","Federal judge issued injunction against government moratorium on oil drilling .
Eric Smith says government didn't properly consider safety records, economic impact .
He says judge noted that expert panel wasn't consulted on moratorium .

"Washington (CNN) -- Shortly after Elena Kagan left the White House in 1999 to teach at her alma mater, Harvard Law School, the nationwide controversy over military recruiting on campus had just begun to heat up. Kagan and fellow academics had actively sought to block military recruiters from Harvard because of the Pentagon's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy on removing openly homosexual service members. Kagan later supported other schools challenging a federal law -- known as the Solomon Amendment -- requiring that recruiters be given equal access or face the loss of federal funding. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the law on March 6, 2006. Just four months after taking the job as Harvard's dean, in October 2003, Kagan offered students her thoughts in a campuswide e-mail, saying that to give recruiters equal access to the campus ""causes me deep distress. I abhor the military's discriminatory recruitment policy."" She called it ""a profound wrong -- a moral injustice of the first order."" The same week as the high court's 2006 ruling in favor of the military, a top Pentagon official wrote colleagues in an internal memo of the department's efforts ""to limit the polarizing nature of the anti-Solomonites who now rattle sabers over an intent to shout down the military."" William Carr, then deputy undersecretary for military personnel policy, noted, ""Dean Kagan is a case in point because she reportedly 'encouraged students to demonstrate against the presence of recruiters ... (and) to express their views clearly and forcefully.' Not a true fan of 'equality and scope' it would appear."" In Rumsfeld v. FAIR, the high court unanimously upheld the Solomon Amendment. ""A military recruiter's mere presence on campus does not violate a law school's right to associate, regardless of how repugnant the law school considers the recruiter's message,"" said Chief Justice John Roberts. Before that ruling, the issue at Harvard was how much access to allow the recruiters. Kagan sought to have campus visits coordinated by student veteran groups, not the Career Services office, and wanted the military not to appear alongside civilian recruiters. Negotiations with the Pentagon and Harvard continued for years, with frustration expressed by both sides. Documents released by the Pentagon over the weekend show that overall, Kagan's involvement was minimal and that the ultimate decision allowing military access was made by the school's president, Larry Summers. But the memos show the two apparently clashed over the issue. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, said Saturday that Kagan acted responsibly and allowed military recruiters at the Harvard Law School. ""The materials produced by the Department of Defense provide further documentation that military recruiters were never barred from the campus of Harvard Law School, neither before Elena Kagan became dean, nor during her tenure,"" Leahy said in a written statement. ""The unfair charge made by some that Elena Kagan broke the law as dean continues to have no basis in law or fact."" But the panel's ranking member, Sen.

"(CNN) -- One of South America's largest historical archives -- 35 million pages that chronicle widespread killing, forced disappearances and torture committed by Brazilian military rulers from 1964 to 1985 -- is  rotting away in an obscure government building in Brazil's capital. Carlos Fico, a leading historian of the so-called ""lead years"" in Brazil, confirmed accounts first reported in the Brazilian newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo about deteriorating conditions at the Brazilian national archives building. Fico -- who has led an academic commission to study classified documents relating to that era -- said Brazil's government suddenly made a large amount of classified documents available to the public. That resulted in an avalanche of military documents that have now been jammed into every corner of the government archives building, including bathrooms. As court orders continue to force military jurisdictions throughout Brazil to send in their documents, the building cannot handle the load, Fico told CNN. And, left unattended, the papers are rotting. ""I have been to the building in Brasilia and I can tell you that it was not made for archiving documents,"" he said. ""There are some serious implications in terms of fire threats and the amount of history being stored there in the last eight years."" A press official with Brazil's government said Sunday that President Luiz Lula Inacio da Silva has not responded to the Folha de Sao Paulo report. Eight years ago, victims' rights groups and academics successfully sued for access to classified documents from the years of military rule in Brazil, a period known for covert military operations against civilians who were deemed subversive to the right-wing military. Many suspects who ran afoul of the military rulers often were punished with torture and many people disappeared. Artists, journalists and students and members of South America's intelligentsia were often implicated. So were activists and church members. Thousands went ""missing""  in Brazil and neighboring nations also ruled by military leaders, human rights observers and journalists claim. The Brazilian archive, growing but perishing rapidly as victims' group seek greater access to information, contains details ranging from Brazil's role in the overthrow of the government of Chilean leader Salvador Allende in 1973, to dealings between the United States government and the Brazilian junta, to the vast spying network on artists and the media, Fico said. ""We already know a lot about U.S. involvement, but the most important part of these documents is regarding the ... repressive activities conducted by the Brazilian military as it collaborated with neighboring countries,"" said Fico. The Brazilian archives shed light on the role of Brazil's leadership in collaborating with neighboring military rulers who, according to human rights observers, committed serious human rights abuses against innocent civilians. ""The preservation of these documents is important to our history and is crucial to victims' families who are seeking the truth and some form indemnity for their missing loved ones,"" said Fico.","One of South America's largest historical archives perishing .

"Londonderry, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- I cut my teeth reporting from Derry during the early days of the ""Troubles"" in Northern Ireland. One thing I remember was the fear -- the fear of the British Army that the Irish people felt, and the fear felt by the British soldiers who came under regular attack by the Irish Republican Army and stone-throwing youths. Another thing I remember was the complete absence of any trust in the government among the mainly Catholic community. Bloody Sunday destroyed all hope that it would be restored anytime soon. On that day, January 30, 1972, 14 people were shot dead by British paratroopers. Everyone knew they were unarmed demonstrators protesting against internment without trial of IRA suspects. But the former head of the British Army, Gen. Mike Jackson, drew up a ""shot report"" claiming that those hit, mostly teenagers, were gunmen or bombers. Then English Chief Justice Lord Widgery, after an inquiry in which he ignored the evidence of eyewitnesses, cleared the soldiers of wrongdoing and accused the innocent victims of illegal activities. The outrage was felt across the whole of Ireland and fueled the IRA campaign of attacks on British targets. Bloody Sunday became a defining moment in the fraught history of British-Irish relations. I returned to Derry Tuesday for the result of the Saville inquiry, a new investigation ordered by the British government as part of the peace process, which has already given Northern Ireland a power-sharing government and the disbandment of paramilitary forces. The atmosphere in the hours before the findings were officially disclosed by British Prime Minister David Cameron was emotional and optimistic. Thousands gathered in Guildhall Square in sunshine as relatives of the victims were given an advance look at the report under strict orders to respect a 3:30 p.m. embargo. But four minutes before the deadline, a hand appeared from an aperture in the second-floor stained-glass windows of the century-old building. It was a thumbs-up. Other hands appeared, waving excitedly, as the crowd cheered and cried. Thus did the people of Derry learn that the slur on the mostly young victims and their families had been removed at last. It was not just a vindication of the relatives, who campaigned for 38 years for justice. Martin McGuinness, former commander of the IRA and now co-leader of the power-sharing government, told me he felt it was ""a moment of liberation for all of us."" As I watched men in their 60s who had marched that day shedding tears of joy, I felt that I was experiencing a moment of closure in the history of the Troubles. A great historical injustice was corrected. It was as if Bloody Sunday and the British prime minister's apology were bookends to the press's reporting of the Troubles -- a feeling reinforced by the return of many correspondents from around the world who reported from Derry that day, like Simon Winchester, formerly of the Guardian, to witness the event. Cameron accepted that British soldiers were responsible for ""unjustified and unjustifiable"" deeds and said that the report exonerated the victims of any wrongdoing. In how many countries in the world would this happen? It is the outcome and climax of a drawing together of the British and Irish governments in the last 20 years to find a joint solution to what seemed to me and everyone else in those dark days of the 1970s to be an insoluble problem. The inquiry sat for 434 days and took testimony from 921 witnesses: 505 civilians, 245 soldiers, 33 police officers, nine forensic experts, 34 IRA members, 39 politicians, civil servants and intelligence officers, 49 journalists and seven priests. Many complained it was too lengthy and expensive. But if Widgery had not whitewashed the paratroopers back then, it would never have been necessary. Relations between the two islands are now at their best in history. The spirit of reconciliation has triumphed -- in Northern Ireland, and in relations between Dublin and London, which were ripped asunder by Bloody Sunday and took so many years to repair. There is a lesson here for the whole world. Lies and coverup make problems worse. The truth can mend fences. The families showed that in their first statement after the report. Their spokeswoman, Kay Duddy -- sister of Jackie Duddy, age 17, the first to be killed that day -- called on the thousands in the square for a minute's silence for all the victims of the violence of the past 40 years. It was a gesture that will not go unnoticed by the victims of the IRA in Northern Ireland's Protestant community. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Conor O'Clery.","On ""Bloody Sunday"" in 1972, 14 protesters shot dead by British soldiers in Northern Ireland .

"(CNN) -- Rain caused major delays at the French Open on Thursday, but there was still time for the hopes of former champion Ana Ivanovic and veteran giantkiller Kimiko Date Krumm to be washed away. Fourth seed Jelena Jankovic and fifth seed Elena Dementieva both battled into the third round along with China's No. 11 Li Na, but Polish eighth seed Agnieszka Radwanska, No. 21 Vera Zvonareva and No. 32 Kateryna Bondarenko all crashed out. World No. 1 Serena Williams was shunted out of the schedule due to the delays, and will play her second-round tie against Germany's Julia Goerges on Friday. Pin-up girl Ivanovic, who climbed to No. 1 in the women's tennis rankings after winning the title in 2008, finally came onto a wet Court No. 1 at 3.42 p.m. local time (1342 GMT). Should the French Open leave Roland Garros? But her bid to recapture the form that has deserted her in the past year ended in a damp squib as the Serbian crashed to a 6-3 6-0 defeat in her second-round match against 28th seed Alisa Kleybanova. The Russian has reached the last 32 of the clay-court Grand Slam event for the first time, and will next face Kazakhstan's Yaroslava Shvedova -- who upset Radwanska 7-5 6-3 following a further rain delay. Men: Murray and Roddick overcome delays . Ivanovic, who has slumped to 42nd in the rankings, made a strong start as she took a 2-0 lead -- but Kleybanova then won the next five games and whitewashed her opponent in the second set to win just over an hour. ""I don't think I played that bad, actually. For a while she didn't miss a ball,"" the 22-year-old Ivanovic told reporters. ""It was a combination of a few things, but she played well today. ""You know, I love this tournament. It's still my favorite tournament. I think I'm on the right path, and I'm doing lots of things right. I have a plan in place and a good team. It's going to take some time. No doubt I'm on the right way."" The 39-year-old Date Krumm stunned last year's losing finalist Dinara Safina in her first appearance at the tournament since 1996, but her win over the ninth-seeded Russian took its toll. The 1995 semifinalist, who ended a 12-year retirement in 2008, was hampered by a calf injury as she lost 6-0 6-3 to Australia's Jarmila Groth. ""Yesterday I had an MRI. The doctor said don't play and that it's too risky,"" the former world No. 4 said. ""I don't like to retire or not play. I decided before the match, I didn't want to do that. I just wanted to try my best and continue. That's why I played."" Groth will next play Russia-born Australian resident Anastasia Rodionova, who defeated her former compatriot Zvonareva 6-4 6-4. Jankovic, a former No. 1, was taken to three sets against Estonian qualifier Kaia Kanepi before defeating the No. 118 6-2 3-6 6-4. The Serbian will play 27th seed Alona Bondarenko in the third round after the Ukrainian won 6-3 6-3 against Slovakia's Magdalena Rybarikova. Dementieva progressed with a 6-2 7-6 (7-3) win over Spain's Anabel Medina Garrigues, setting up a last-32 clash with Canada's Aleksandra Wozniak, who ousted Kateryna Bondarenko 6-4 6-1. Na defeated France's Stephanie Cohen-Aloro 6-2 6-2 and will next play Italian 17th seed Francesca Schiavone. Three other second-round matches were still undecided when play finally came to a halt. Four-time champion Justine Henin, seeded 22nd in her comeback appearance at the event, led Klara Zakopalova of the Czech Republic 6-3 3-2. Another former world No. 1, Maria Sharapova, was ahead 6-3 2-2 against Henin's fellow Belgian Kirsten Flipkens. Home hope Marion Bartoli, the 13th seed, trailed 6-5 in her match against compatriot Olivia Sanchez.","Ana Ivanovic, the 2008 French Open champion, loses in second round after rain delay .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- The lengthy documents they initially were asked to sign used language even a native English speaker would struggle to understand. The Vietnamese interpreters BP first brought in for safety and cleanup training stirred painful memories and suspicions because they spoke to the elders with a North Vietnamese dialect and used what some described as ""Communist terminology."" The closings of fishing areas have been announced on radio stations these fishermen don't follow, so some have piloted their boats where they shouldn't, which means tickets from the Coast Guard keep coming. For the Vietnamese-Americans living in the Gulf Coast region, the oil disaster is especially complicated. It's made murky by language barriers, cultural misunderstandings and a history of challenges that have shaped them for more than half a century. Their ties to seafood run deep and wide. A third of all fishermen in the Gulf are Vietnamese, making them arguably the most affected minority out there. More than 24,000 people of Vietnamese origin live in Louisiana, according to the last completed census. About 6,000 live within a two-mile radius in the neighborhood of New Orleans East -- distinguishing it, the area's priest says, as the greatest concentration of Vietnamese people outside of Vietnam. In the rectory of Mary Queen of Vietnam Church, the Rev. Vien Nguyen sits in front of an altar to his ancestors and his Catholic faith. Religious texts in English and his native tongue fill the high shelves around him, as do books bearing titles like ""Freshwater Crayfish Aquaculture,"" ""The Evolution of Cajun & Creole Cuisine"" and Franz Kafka's ""The Trial."" Here, he introduces some of the Kafkaesque oil-disaster trials facing his own people. He talks about their distrust of lawyers -- ""sharks,"" he calls them -- who've come in from out of state, circling them with promises and confusing papers. He mentions the mental health concerns -- depression, lack of sleep, tensions in homes -- that need to be addressed, a task made difficult by an absence of Vietnamese-speaking therapists in a community that still stigmatizes admissions of emotional trouble. He worries about the lack of job training and opportunities for a people who've worked in an industry that may suffer for God knows how long. ""These are proud, active people who contribute to their own livelihood, and now they have to be in lines,"" asking for handouts, he says. ""It is a devastating blow."" About 80 percent of Vietnamese-Americans in the Gulf region are connected to the seafood industry through jobs that include fishing, shucking oysters, packing shrimp, and running stores and restaurants, the priest and others say. The work they do is something many brought with them from fishing villages in their native land, a place most of them fled as ""boat people"" after the 1975 fall of Saigon and the end of the Vietnam War. That departure was for many the second time they'd become refugees. They'd already uprooted themselves and started over with nothing in 1954, when their country divided into North and South and they, as the Catholic minority living in Vietnam, ran from the Communist rule that took over the North. The former Archbishop Philip Hannan of the Archdiocese of New Orleans reached out to them in refugee camps in America, inviting them to call his home theirs. So they came here in the '70s and '80s with the help of Catholic Charities and, over the next 30 years, reinvented their lives once more -- in a climate reminiscent of the country they'd left behind. They worked hard in a familiar industry that didn't require them to master English, often leaving their children to be cared for by older siblings and relatives so they could put in long days. They created a self-reliant community where their own local businesses thrived. They planted acres of vegetable gardens along levees, incorporating the agricultural roots of their ancestors. Today, people wearing the traditional conical straw hats stoop in their cultivated yards or walk along streets with names like Saigon Drive. A trailer, lined with coolers of freshly caught shrimp for sale at hiked-up prices, is parked in front of a strip mall that includes Tram Anh Video, Kim Tram Jewelry and Tien Pharmacy. Hurricane Katrina five years ago marked the third time they lost everything and had to start over. But it was also the storm that gave them a voice. The documentary ""A Village Called Versailles"" -- a reference to the public housing project where they first settled  -- debuted on PBS last month. It chronicles how the Vietnamese-Americans living in New Orleans East galvanized after Katrina, making theirs among the first neighborhoods to rebuild. Grass-roots organizers established agencies to fight for assistance and empower people, including one for youth called the Vietnamese American Young Leaders Association of New Orleans (VAYLA-NO). The church, which began holding Mass just six weeks after the floodwaters destroyed what they'd created, became a staging ground for construction help and community meals. Health clinics sprouted up, as did a new charter school. And collectively, they protested a planned 90-foot-high landfill of hurricane debris on their neighborhood's edge, shutting down a move by the city government that they'd never confronted en masse before. A few years later, in 2008, they'd help elect the nation's first Vietnamese-American congressman, Louisiana Republican Anh ""Joseph"" Cao. The next challenge: oil . Over a bowl of homemade pho, a Vietnamese beef noodle soup, Tuan Nguyen provides a glimpse into how the community is mobilizing to face its newest challenge. He's the 30-year-old deputy director of the Mary Queen of Vietnam Community Development Corporation (MQVN CDC), established after Katrina, and serves on the rapid response team created by Cao after the oil disaster. Along with others on the team, he's been crisscrossing the region, meeting with fishermen and others -- not just Vietnamese -- to assess their needs, gather testimonies, answer questions and advocate on their behalf. They've succeeded in gaining the ear of a BP official, Larry Thomas, who among other things has approved the hiring of qualified and trained bilingual interpreters. ""We had never been exposed to the Vietnamese community,"" says Thomas, the BP manager of government and public affairs for the lower 48 states and the Gulf of Mexico. ""Clearly, it's a tight-knit community, and it's been a steep learning curve for us. The interaction has been great."" Even with all he knows about navigating the system and securing whatever assistance is available, whether that's food stamps or BP claim dollars, Nguyen can't persuade some of his own relatives to get the help they so desperately need. ""One of my wife's uncles is a very proud man. He's a deckhand. I told him to come in and talk about services,"" Nguyen says. ""He said, 'I can't stand in line. What if someone sees me?' "" While his wife's uncle won't accept assistance, others in the state have driven hours to get simple answers to questions from agencies like the MQVN CDC. The hope, Nguyen and others say, is that grass-roots organizations will sprout up elsewhere to help meet the growing and often different community needs. One such organization has already been formed in Biloxi, Mississippi, an area that is home to about 5,000 Vietnamese-Americans. The Mississippi Coalition of Vietnamese American Fisherfolk and Families, led by volunteers, is hoping to step in where the New Orleans organizations logistically can't. Celina Tran, 36, is working full-time -- on top of her real estate broker job -- to help wherever she can. She's accompanying people to the BP claims office. She's meeting with fisherfolk to discuss their concerns and recognizes with frustration how unqualified she is to talk to them about fights in their marriages. She's sending testimonials to the state judiciary, in an attempt to force Mississippi to expand assistance opportunities. And all the while, she's worrying about what the future holds. She sees families falling behind on mortgages -- for their homes and their boats. At about $1 million a pop, many of the big Biloxi vessels require payments of $10,000 to $15,000 a month. The up to $5,000 a month that BP is paying out to captains and boat owners is of little comfort to them, especially when there are home mortgages, too, college tuition payments and more. ""They've been doing this for 45 years, 50 years of their life. They've relied on each other,"" Tran says. ""If this drags out, it will only get worse."" Nearly 180 miles away, back over the Louisiana state line, Ngoc Nguyen is racing around with her clipboard. She and her husband own St. Vincent Seafood in Leeville, a small fishing community. It's a business they took over from her father-in-law, who's standing around the dock in his ""Luck of the Irish"" T-shirt. The shrimp being unloaded off their boat amounts to a third of what they usually bring in, says Nguyen, 27. It was out for two months, but given water closures imposed because of the oil disaster, access to shrimp was limited. ""There's nothing else we can do,"" she says, refusing to ponder what the family's alternative would be if life doesn't get back to normal, and soon. ""We've never invested in anything else. It's all seafood."" But Rep. Cao holds out hope that the Vietnamese community in the Gulf will pull through -- because it always has. ""We are resilient people. We are survivors,"" he says. ""It's an obstacle in life, and we will overcome it. And we will emerge stronger.""","Language and cultural barriers, troubled history complicate oil disaster for Vietnamese .

"(CNN) -- Carlos Tevez scored twice as Argentina beat Mexico 3-1 in Johannesburg, South Africa, to set up a meeting with Germany in the quarterfinals of the World Cup. The Manchester City striker opened the scoring after 25 minutes in controversial fashion when television replays, which were relayed on the giant screens in the stadium, showed he was offside when he received the ball from Lionel Messi and headed into the net. Despite protests from the Mexican players, the goal was allowed to stand. Argentina doubled its lead when Gonzalo Higuain rounded goalkeeper Oscar Perez to score his fourth goal of the tournament. Tevez made certain of the victory with a stunning long-range strike into the top corner early in the second half. Javier Hernandez pulled a goal back for Mexico with a powerful left-footed drive after 70 minutes, but it proved to be little more than a consolation for the Mexicans as Argentina easily claimed the victory. Manager Diego Maradona's men almost scored a fourth goal when Perez had to dive to his right in stoppage-time to tip Messi's shot over the bar. Mexico, who has now gone out in the last 16 at five World Cups in a row, may feel the result could have been different without the error from the officials. After seeing the error on the big screens, Mexican players surrounded the referee and his assistant but the officials decided not to revoke the goal. The controversy marked the second major officiating mistake of the day at the World Cup after England midfielder Frank Lampard was denied a goal against Germany, even though his shot struck the bar and bounced some two feet over the line. Germany, who was leading 2-1 at the time of Lampard's strike, went on to win 4-1. The Germany-Argentina clash will take place in Cape Town, South Africa, on Saturday, July 3.","Argentina beats Mexico 3-1 in Johannesburg to reach World Cup quarterfinals .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona have signed Spain striker David Villa from league rivals Valencia for $49 million, further boosting an already potent forward line. The 28-year-old goalscorer will be in Barcelona on Thursday evening and will undergo a medical test on Friday morning, the Spanish champions said on their official Web site. Villa scored 107 goals in five seasons for Valencia and lines up alongside Liverpool marksman Fernando Torres in the Spanish national team. He was the tournament's leading scorer with four goals when Spain won the European Championship in 2008. Catalan giants Barca are looking to strengthen their side ahead of next season -- after sealing the defence of the league title on Sunday with a record haul of 99 points. Villa joins an attack which already features world player of the year Lionel Messi, Swedish star Zlatan Ibrahimovic, France captain Thierry Henry and Spanish youngsters Pedro and Bojan Krkic. Villa was linked to Barcelona last season but after the two clubs failed to reach a deal he stayed on at cash-strapped Valencia for another season. Another successful season, in which Villa scored 29 goals in all competitions to help Valencia finish third to secure a place in the Champions League, persuaded Barcelona to move once again for the Spanish international striker. Meanwhile, club president Joan Laporta has commented on rumors that Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas is to make a return to the club he played for as a youth team player. Fabregas has once again been strongly linked with leaving Arsenal amid media speculation that he wants to play once again for his home town club and Laporta said: ""It's remarkable that a player should commit himself in this way (if the reports are true) ""If the club technical staff believe we need to make the extra effort and sign him, we'll speak to Arsenal,"" Laporta added. Barcelona have also confirmed that Argentine international defender Gabriel Milito will remain at the club after signing a new contract until 2012.","NEW: Barcelona complete the signing of David Villa from Valencia for $48.8 million .

"(CNN) -- A gay couple in Malawi, found guilty of gross indecency and unnatural acts after they took part in an ""engagement ceremony,"" was sentenced to 14 years in prison Thursday. Steven Mojenza, 26, and Tiwonge Chimbalanga, 20, were convicted in a court Tuesday. The pair was arrested in December at their home in Blantyre, Malawi, for professing their love in a traditional engagement ceremony. They were rounded up after news reports surfaced, charged under colonial-era sodomy laws and detained at Chichiru Prison without bail. The arrests received some popular support in the conservative southern African nation, but sparked condemnation by gay rights activists. Human rights groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have called for the release of the couple. Critics on the scene and condemned the sentence. ""There was no victim in this case, yet they were given a very harsh sentence by the judge,"" said Gift Trapence, executive director of a Malawi human rights group. Trapence said the majority of Malawians supported the verdict, but feared the harsh sentence would push much of the country's gay community further underground. ""This sentence sends a strong and unacceptable message that discrimination is legally justified in the Malawi justice system,"" said Michelle Kagari, deputy Africa program director at Amnesty International, in a written statement. Amnesty International said the couple told their attorneys they were beaten by police while in custody. British officials said in a joint statement they were ""deeply dismayed"" at the couple's conviction, as well as allegations they were mistreated in police custody. ""Malawi has made significant progress on human rights in recent years,"" said Henry Bellingham, Foreign Office under-secretary, along with Stephen O' Brien, parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Department for International Development, and Lynne Featherstone, minister for equality at the Home Office. ""The government has signed up to international human rights treaties and Malawi's constitution protects the rights of all its citizens. Infringement of these rights is intolerable. The conviction and sentencing ... runs counter to a positive trend."" In Washington, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said the United States condemned the conviction and sentencing. ""The criminalization of sexual orientation and gender identity is unconscionable, and this case mars the human rights record of Malawi,"" he said. ""We urge Malawi and all countries to stop using sexual orientation or gender identity as the basis for arrest, detention, or execution."" Philip J. Crowley, assistant secretary of state for public affairs, said ""the United States is appalled"" by the conviction and sentence, which he called ""a significant step backward for the government of Malawi's human-rights record. Malawi must abide by its human-rights obligations."" Decriminalization of homosexuality is key not only to the protection of universal human rights, but is also ""crucial to the urgent need to fight the spread of HIV/AIDS,"" he said. Homosexuality is illegal in Malawi -- as it is in most African nations -- and government officials have said they are simply upholding the law. But activists in Malawi say Article 20 of the country's constitution -- which outlaws discrimination -- is being violated. The Malawi Law Society said the prosecution of the two men has been driven by prejudice -- not jurisprudence. Anthony Kamanga, Malawi's solicitor general and secretary for justice and constitutional affairs, said the law does not conflict with the constitution, and denied the charge of prejudice. ""I do not think that in this particular case that these two people were prejudiced against,"" he said. ""We have no law that criminalizes sexual orientation, just certain sexual acts."" Kamanga said the criticism is unfair. ""For some reason, this case has been blown out of proportion,"" he charged. ""The courts have been fair to these two men."" ""Most people are repugnant towards homosexuality,"" said Canaan Phiri, secretary general of the Malawi Council of Churches. ""People do not declare their homosexuality because people are against this."" Ahead of the verdict, the two men thanked their supporters, remaining defiant in a statement released through Tatchell. In it, Chimbalanga said: ""I love Steven so much. If people or the world cannot give me the chance and freedom to continue living with him as my lover, then I am better off to die here in prison. Freedom without him is useless and meaningless."" CNN's David McKenzie contributed to this report.","NEW: Sentence ""sends a strong, unacceptable message,"" Amnesty says .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Police in Indonesia have confirmed that a man arrested on Wednesday is one of the most wanted terrorists in the country.

I don't think I've ever seen better times as an entrepreneur. But the world is a mess, and the country is a mess. King: Why [is it a] good time for an entrepreneur and not necessarily for others? Trump: Well, this is a time for smart people. This is a time for entrepreneurial people. This is a great time for people like me -- and maybe people like you, Larry, because I know you're a great investor. ... Weren't you involved with [Bernie] Madoff? King: A little bit, yes. You weren't, huh? How did you resist him? Trump: Honestly, I got lucky. He might have duped me like he did a lot of other people. He is a disaster. But now he's where he belongs. King: With troubled times like this for the average guy, is this the time to think like a champion?  Watch Larry King's entire interview with Donald Trump » . Trump:  This is the best time to think like a champion. As an example, the house is being foreclosed. You go see your bank -- maybe you can make a deal, maybe you can't. But you can make a deal with a bank on another house, and much better than the one you're living in. ... They'll do any deal to get rid of their product. They have houses by the thousands. And you go see that bank and you make a deal. King: How do you assess [Barack Obama]? Trump: Well, I really like him. I think that he's working very hard. He's trying to rebuild our reputation throughout the world. The previous administration was a total disaster, a total catastrophe. And, you know, the world looks at us differently than they used to. ... He was handed a pretty bad deck of cards. And I'm not saying I agree with everything he's doing. ... I do agree with what they're doing with the banks. Whether they fund them or nationalize them, it doesn't matter, but you have to keep the banks going. King: Do you assess him as a champion? Trump: Oh, yes, he's a champion. I mean, he won against all odds. When he first announced, people were giving him virtually no chance. And he's just done something that's amazing. King: Is fear harmful in this [economic] situation, Donald, or is it realistic? Trump: Well, I think it's realistic. People are afraid. They're scared. They're losing their jobs. They're losing their homes. And certainly there is a word known as fear, and there's nothing wrong with being fearful. But you have to do something about it. And that's what I write about in the book. You go out. You go to the right place, where there's better employment. You get a trade where they really need people. King: Have you had to lay off people? Because it seems everyone has had to do that. Trump: It's a sad thing, but whether it's ""The Apprentice"" or not,  the fact is you have to say to some people: ""You're fired."" The world is different. King: You said that this is a good time to buy real estate. What about financing? What if you want to buy and you can't get the mortgage? Trump: Larry, this is a great time to buy real estate. And as far as financing is concerned, the only financing you should be thinking about is seller financing. If the seller won't give you financing, don't do it, because the banks are not doing their job. They're not providing financing for deals. King: New York state is planning a so-called millionaire's tax. It would affect those with incomes starting at $300,000. Yea or nay? Trump: Well, it's a ridiculous thing. Albany is going to destroy  ... this state. And they are raising taxes on rich people. The rich people have lots of options, Larry. One option is Palm Beach, Florida. You move down to Palm Beach; it's not the worst thing in the world. I don't have to live on Fifth Avenue. I don't have to live on Park Avenue. It's hard, psychologically, for me to leave, but very easy physically. King: Why don't patriots want to pay taxes? Trump: Well, I don't know that that's necessarily unpatriotic. I think they want to pay taxes. Obviously, you have to pay taxes. But they want to pay a reasonable tax, and they don't want to see the money squandered. Money in this country is being squandered. King: OK. But then we would debate reasonable. Trump: Well, you always debate reasonable. I think unreasonable is the war in Iraq. I mean, there's $1 trillion right there. And, more importantly, thousands of people -- both on our side and the other side -- hundreds of thousands of people killed and maimed and so badly hurt, I think it's just a shame. Now, to me, that's unreasonable. And, by the way, ... Saddam Hussein did not knock down the World Trade Center. King: Has the economy at all cramped your lifestyle? Anything you had to change? Trump: No, because I think I understand life. I think I understand how to live. I'm enjoying my life. I don't really live in an as extravagant a way as people think. As an entrepreneur, this is the best time I think I've ever seen in business. King: There's buzz that your beautiful daughter Ivanka is engaged or getting engaged. What's up? Trump: She has a beautiful boyfriend. He's a great guy, but they are not engaged. King: Would you like them to? Is he the kind of guy you would except as a son-in-law? Trump: He certainly is a wonderful guy. But it's all up to her. If she's happy, I'm happy.","Trump advises to take advantage of low prices, get seller to do the financing .

"London, England (CNN) -- All non-European immigrants to the United Kingdom must pass a basic English language test before being granted a visa under new rules announced by the government Wednesday. The rules will apply to anyone wanting to join their spouse or partner in the United Kingdom, and they will come into effect in autumn this year, the government said. ""I believe being able to speak English should be a prerequisite for anyone who wants to settle here,"" Home Secretary Theresa May said. She said the new requirement will ""help promote integration, remove cultural barriers, and protect public services."" Anyone wishing to come to the United Kingdom as a partner must demonstrate a basic command of conversational English by proving they have passed the test at an approved testing center, the Home Office said. ""It is a privilege to come to the U.K., and that is why I am committed to raising the bar for migrants and ensuring that those who benefit from being in Britain contribute to our society,"" May said in a statement. She said the change is just a first step, and that the government is hoping to tighten the English-language requirements even further. ""Today's announcement is one of a wide range of measures the new government is taking to ensure that immigration is properly controlled for the benefit of the U.K., alongside a limit on work visas and an effective system for regulating the students who come here,"" May said. Under current rules, people applying for visas to join their partners must first meet a range of criteria, including showing that their marriage or partnership is genuine, and that they can support themselves financially. They must first apply for a two-year settlement visa. After that, they can apply for permission to settle in Britain -- known as indefinite leave to remain, which is similar to a U.S. green card -- but they must first take a test on British culture, politics, and laws. The new English test will be in addition to that test, the Home Office said.","Britain introduces language test for all non-European immigrants .

"Srinagar, Indian-Controlled Kashmir (CNN) -- One person was killed and four others injured Sunday when Indian security forces opened fire on a violent mob that tried to torch a paramilitary bunker in Srinagar, the capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir. The incident occurred during the funeral of a youth who died in the hospital Saturday night after he was allegedly beaten by members of the Indian paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force during violent protests last week. The family of 25-year-old Rafiq Bangroo said CRPF troopers struck him on the head with gun butts, causing a fatal skull injury. The CRPF has denied the allegation, saying Bangroo died after he was pelted with stones. Bangroo's body was handed over to relatives. As it was being carried for burial Sunday, angry mobs charged at a bunker of the CRPF and attempted to burn it, police said. The CRPF troopers manning the bunker opened fire on the crowd. Five people were injured, and one, a 26-year-old man, later died. ""They tried to torch the bunker after damaging it. Our soldiers opened fire in self-defense,"" CRPF spokesman Prabhakar Tripathi told CNN. As the clashes started spreading Sunday, Indian security forces were rushed to the area to enforce an undeclared curfew. Hundreds shouting ""We want freedom"" joined the funeral procession. Bangroo's death triggered impromptu protests in various parts of the city. Police and paramilitary troops used tear gas and baton charges and fired warning shots in the air in some spots to break up the angry protesters, according to authorities. The Kashmiri separatist group All Parties Hurriyat Conference has called for a Kashmir-wide shutdown Monday to protest the killings. Srinagar has been tense over the past week following the killing of another youth, a 17-year-old student who died June 11 after being struck in the head by a police-fired tear smoke shell. Kashmir been in the throes of a violent separatist campaign for over two decades and has been a source of conflict between India and Pakistan. The mounting toll in the region's two-decade-old insurgency is placed at over 43,000 by officials, while various rights groups and NGOs put the figure at twice the official number.","Indian security forces open fire on protesters .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- More than 1,000 people have been rescued from rushing flood waters in eastern China after a dike burst on the Fu river in Jiangxi province, the Xinhua news agency reported. About 35,000 people had to flee the area because of the rushing water, the news agency said. This new flooding comes as heavy rains have battered nine Chinese provinces -- including Fujian, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces -- in the last two weeks. Devastating floods have already killed 199 people and left another 123 missing, Xinhua reported, quoting a Ministry of Civil Affairs statement. More than 29 million have been affected with almost 2.6 million evacuated from their homes, Xinhua said. Total economic losses could reach 42.12 billion yuan ($6.17 billion) with 1.6 million hectares of farmland flooded and 12.5 percent of crops destroyed. Chinese President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao called for an all-out effort to combat floods and rescue victims Tuesday, Xinhua reported. iReport: Are you there? Share photos, video .

"(CNN) -- Canada's Cabinet ministers are in hot water for their government's plans to spend nearly $2 million building a man-made lake for this month's G20 summit. The indoor lake, designed as part of a new complex in downtown Toronto for reporters covering the meeting, was one of several items that drew sharp criticism from left-wing legislators during a question period in Parliament Monday. ""Instead of hosting world leaders, maybe the government should consider party-planning for Lady Gaga,"" Liberal MP Mark Holland said, claiming the country's budget for hosting the event also included paying for ""dancers, singers, fiddlers and flowers"" with $20 million Canadian (about $18.9 million U.S. dollars). Critics said the lavish expenditures seemed out of place for a meeting that will focus on recovering from the global economic crisis. But cabinet members defended the Canadian government's plans as they faced shouts and heckles. ""It's a normal practice for the host country of an international summit to use the opportunity to showcase all their country has to offer, and that is exactly what we're doing...and we're going to be proud to showcase Canada to the world, contrary to what the Liberals want to do,"" Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon said. The G8 summit will take place from June 25-26 at a lakeside resort north of Toronto. About 3,000 journalists will cover the event from the media center in Toronto, which will also host the G20 summit from June 26-27, Transport Minister John Baird said Monday. ""We're proud of our government's efforts to showcase this great country so it can be a magnet for jobs, investment and opportunity,"" he said. Toronto sits on the coast of Lake Ontario, one of the five Great Lakes. ""We've got a government here that has to create an artificial lake, when Canada has more lakes than just about any other country in the world,"" said MP Jack Layton, Canada's social democratic party leader. ""The taxpayers are going to end up at the bottom of the fake lake.""","Canada's G20 hosting plans include construction of fake lake .

"Governor's Island, New York (CNN) -- The ""sport of kings"" proved a bit tricky this weekend for Britain's Prince Harry, who fell headfirst off his horse during a charity polo match in New York. The prince, who is third in line to the throne, was sending the ball downfield when he overbalanced. He pitched forward, keeping hold of the reins with one hand while he rolled to land on his backside. He did not appear to be hurt. The 25-year-old prince walked backed to his horse and remounted to cheers from the crowd on the baking hot day on Governor's Island. Harry was playing in the Veuve Clicqout Polo Classic in aid of a charity he co-founded to help AIDS victims in the tiny African nation of Lesotho in South Africa. Prince Seeiso of Lesotho is the other co-founder of the charity, Sentebale. Harry, the younger son of Prince Charles and the late Diana, Princess of Wales, has faced more dangerous situations than a charity polo match -- he served for two months as an Army officer in Afghanistan, and is now training to be a military helicopter pilot. CNN's Andrea Mineo contributed to this report.","Prince Harry was playing in charity polo match .

"(CNN) -- Former Pakistan captain Mohammad Yousuf has quit international cricket after he was hit with an indefinite suspension. Yousuf was given the ban earlier this month by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) after they launched an inquiry into a winless tour to Australia. The 35-year-old and Younus Khan were accused of ""infighting"" while seven other players also received bans. A story on the PCB's official Web site quoted Yousuf as saying: ""The level of support shown to me since the ban by the fans has really touched me and I appreciate all the messages of support I have received. ""I will always remember the backing of the fans, and the support from my family and my friends at this difficult time. ""It was never my intention to suddenly stop playing international cricket like this and I feel that I still have 2 or 3 years international cricket left in me and could have gone on playing for Pakistan. ""I always wanted to retire when I felt the time was right and not for it to be dictated to me. I feel physically fit and feel that I could have served the nation well for at least the next couple of years, but I guess it wasn't meant to be. ""I have no issues or axes to grind with team mates, however I am disappointed with my treatment by those in authority and that is the reason why I want to retire from international cricket.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Colleagues of Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia mourned his death as family and friends planned his funeral. Byrd, the longest-serving member of the U.S. Congress, died Monday at the age of 92. Under West Virginia law, the state's popular two-term Democratic governor, Joe Manchin, has the power to appoint Byrd's successor. Manchin is expected to name a fellow member of his party to succeed Byrd, who was also a Democrat, thereby keeping a total of 59 Democrats in the Senate. There are questions, however, regarding exactly how long Byrd's appointed successor can serve before another election is held. West Virginia law says that if a Senate vacancy is created within two and a half years of the end of a term, the appointed successor will automatically serve out the remainder of the term. If not, a special election is required. Byrd's current term is scheduled to end on January 3, 2013. The two and a half year mark will be reached on Saturday, July 3. West Virginia law fails, however, to state exactly when a vacancy occurs. Whether the vacancy is considered to have been created at the moment of Byrd's death, or when the Senate informs state officials of the vacancy, or when Manchin declares the seat vacant will be crucial. West Virginia -- a traditional Democratic stronghold -- has been increasingly competitive for the Republicans. John McCain easily defeated Barack Obama in West Virginia in the 2008 presidential election. Neither Manchin nor the Democratic-led Senate have made any official declarations yet. As question swirl around the timing of the next election for Byrd's seat, numerous political leaders have been issuing statements in remembrance of the nine-term senator: . -- President Barack Obama . ""The people of West Virginia have lost a true champion, the United States Senate has lost a venerable institution, and America has lost a voice of principle and reason with the passing of Robert C. Byrd. Senator Byrd's story was uniquely American. He was born into wrenching poverty, but educated himself to become an authoritative scholar, respected leader, and unparalleled champion of our Constitution. He scaled the summit of power, but his mind never strayed from the people of his beloved West Virginia. He had the courage to stand firm in his principles, but also the courage to change over time."" -- Gov. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia . ""Sen. Byrd was a fearless fighter for the constitution, his beloved state and its great people. He made a significant mark as a member of Congress in both our state's and nation's history. His accomplishments and contributions will define history for eternity."" -- Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-West Virginia . ""It has been my greatest privilege to serve with Robert C. Byrd in the United States Senate. I looked up to him, I fought next to him, and I am deeply saddened that he is gone. He leaves a void that simply can never be filled. But I am lifted by the knowledge of his deep and abiding faith in God, I have joy in the thought of him reunited with his dear (late wife) Erma, and I am proud knowing that his moving life story and legacy of service and love for West Virginia will live on. Senator Byrd came from humble beginnings in the southern coalfields, was raised by hard-working West Virginians, and triumphantly rose to the heights of power in America. But he never forgot where he came from nor who he represented, and he never abused that power for his own gain."" -- Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada . ""By virtue of his endurance, Robert Byrd knew and worked with many of the greats of the United States Senate. Because of his enduring virtue, he will be remembered as one of them. Senator Byrd dedicated every single day of his Senate service to strengthening the institution, state and republic that he loved so dearly. There will never be another like him."" --Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky . ""Sen. Byrd combined a devotion to the U.S. Constitution with a deep learning of history to defend the interests of his state and the traditions of the Senate. We will remember him for his fighter's spirit, his abiding faith, and for the many times he recalled the Senate to its purposes. ... We are glad to know that Senator Byrd and his beloved Erma are reunited. We extend our deepest sympathies to the entire Byrd family."" --Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont . ""No senator came to care more about the Constitution or to be a more effective defender of our constitutional government than the senior senator from West Virginia. He was a senator's senator. ... I know him as a mentor and a friend. I was honored to stand with him and fight against assaults on the Constitution and against an unnecessary and costly war in Iraq. He was a self-educated man who learned much throughout his life and had much to teach us all. He was a symbol of West Virginia, he was an outstanding senator, and he was extraordinary American."" --Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama . ""It is a sad day for all of us. There was no one who loved the institution of the Senate more, and no one who was a better student of it."" CNN's Ted Barrett, Alan Silverleib, and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","NEW: President Obama: Senate has ""lost a venerable institution""

"(CNN) -- Israeli police are restricting Friday prayers at Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem following intelligence reports about possible riots in the city, Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. Men age 40 and under will not be allowed to pray at the mosque Friday, he said. When Israeli officials have concerns about possible violence, it is not uncommon for them to limit the access young men have to the mosque. Hatem Abdel Qader, a Fatah official in Jerusalem, told CNN that such restrictions have become common in recent years. ""This is an excuse that Israel uses for security reasons to prevent the largest number of citizens from reaching the old city and the Aqsa mosque,"" he said. Israeli officials have said public safety concerns prompt the restrictions, but Qader said the motivation is religious. The mosque, which is located on the Temple Mount in East Jerusalem, has been a site of clashes between Israelis and Palestinians. In 1996, dozens of people were killed in rioting related to the mosque. CNN's Kareem Khadder contributed to this report.","Israeli police say they're limiting mosque access .
