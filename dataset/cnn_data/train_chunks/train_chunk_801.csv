"By . Louise Boyle . A woman who is 18 weeks' pregnant was asked to leave a Planet Fitness gym during her workout because her 'belly was hanging out'. Melissa Mantor, 31, was told by a female employee on Monday that her outfit - of a tank top and leggings - violated dress code at the gym in Charleston, South Carolina. The stay-at-home mom, who has been married since 2006 and has a three-year-old daughter, told MailOnline: 'I went to the gym for my usual workout but it was the first day that I was visibly pregnant. 'I . was on the treadmill, when a female employee came up to me and said . ''I'm going to have to ask you to leave, you are in violation of the . dress code.'' Melissa Mantor, from South Carolina, was asked to leave a branch of Planet Fitness, because her 'belly was hanging out' in this tank top. Mrs Mantor is 18 weeks pregnant . 'She then said: ''I'm going to have to send you home to get changed because your belly's hanging out and I need to get it covered up. I told her: ''Of course my belly is hanging out, I am pregnant.''' The employee then handed her a large, black t-shirt to cover up her pregnant bump. The 31-year-old said: 'People around me were shocked. The girl next to me asked ''Is this really happening?''' Mrs Mantor finished her workout, went home and tried to call the manager of the gym who didn't respond. She then went into the West Ashley gym the following day to cancel her membership and was told again that she had 'obviously' violated the dress code policy. She was told that her choice of gym attire 'was not appropriate for our gym members'. The . Planet Fitness dress code does not mention bare midriffs but does say . that customers cannot wear 'string tank tops'. Mrs Mantor said that she has regularly . worn the tank top - and about 20 others like it in different colors - in the three years she has been a gym member and it has never been a problem. She is even wearing the tank top in her gym membership photograph. The 31-year-old married mother said that she has regularly worn the tank top and similar ones in different colors to the West Ashley gym . She . admits that the top does ride up from time to time over her baby bump . but that prior to this incident, no one had a problem with it. Mrs Mantor has now canceled her gym membership. She said that a representative from Planet Fitness called to offer a free month's membership but she refused. 'I can't go to a gym where they would make someone feel bad about themselves when they are trying to stay in shape,' she said. 'It's hard enough to get motivated as it is without being made to feel like my body is offensive and that I'm dressed inappropriately.' Planet Fitness's logo is 'No Gymtimidation'. The mission statement says the company provides a 'diverse, Judgement Free Zone'. MailOnline reached out to the Planet . Fitness branch in Charleston but was told that the manager . was not available for comment. Mrs Mantor was asked to leave the gym in West Ashley (pictured) on Monday by a female employee . McCall Gosselin, Director of Public Relations for Planet Fitness, said in a statement: 'The majority of Planet Fitness clubs are owned and operated by individual franchisees. Our corporate dress code policy, which is enforced at the discretion of club staff, states that jeans, boots, men’s string tank tops, or revealing clothing are prohibited. 'This particular location also had a stated policy that prohibited bare midriffs. In this instance, a staff member approached the member to inform her of the policy and offer her a free t-shirt to complete her workout. She was not asked to leave the gym as a result of her attire. 'The franchise owner has reached out to the member directly to address the situation. At Planet Fitness, we are committed to providing a comfortable and welcoming environment for everyone, and we are working with the franchise owner to clarify the dress code policy moving forward.' The Planet Fitness dress code which is posted on their corporate Facebook page . This is not the first time that Planet Fitness has faced controversy over its heavy-handed tactics on gym-goers' attire. An Albuquerque Planet Fitness refused to let a Muslim woman wear her religious head covering while she tried to work out, according to a lawsuit filed in March. Tarainia McDaniel, 37, recently filed the lawsuit in a New Mexico district court stemming from an October 2011 clash that prevented McDaniel from using the gym - even though court documents said another Planet Fitness had previously let her. The lawsuit said she was turned away at the gym and was told the head covering didn't meet its dress code. Tiffany Austin, from Richmond, California, claimed in March that a branch of Planet Fitness asked her to cover up because her toned physique was intimidating other members.","Melissa Mantor was asked to leave by a .

"By . James  Nye . The real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the mythical online figure who created bitcoin has apparently been revealed - and it turns out he is called Satoshi Nakamoto. Tracked down to a modest home in Temple City, California, the 64-year-old model train enthusiast behind the world's best-known digital currency was discovered by Newsweek magazine after a two-month investigation. They unearthed his shadowy dealings with US military technology contractors, his mysterious work for the FAA in the aftermath of 9/11 and claimed that he could be potentially sitting on a $657 million fortune from his invention that he mysteriously refuses to touch. Reclusive inventor: This man is believed to be Satoshi Nakamoto - the man who is thought to have created Bitcoin - the world's most recognized digital currency forum . The reclusive and secretive Nakamoto, whose own brother described as 'an a**hole', was interviewed on his doorstep - as Newsweek appeared to solve one of the largest mysteries of the digital age. 'I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it,' he said to the magazine's reporter about his connection to the now troubled online currency. Revealed: The man widely believed to be Bitcoin currency founder Satoshi Nakamoto is surrounded by reporters as he leaves his home in Temple City, California on Thursday . 'It's been turned over to other people,' he said without specifying who. 'They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.' Describing his appearance as he . answered the door, the Newsweek reporter said that anyone would have . trouble believing this was the man whose creation could potentially . revolutionize the financial system and could be a multi-millionaire. 'He’s . wearing a rumpled T-shirt, old blue jeans and white gym socks, without . shoes, like he has left the house in a hurry. His hair is unkempt, and . he has the thousand-mile stare of someone who has gone weeks without . sleep,' wrote investigative reporter Leah McGrath Goodman. Startled . by his apparent discovery, Nakamoto called the police to intervene - . claiming that he would be in danger if he spoke to the reporter. 'So, what is it you want to ask this man about? one of the officers asked the Newsweek reporter. 'He thinks if he talks to you, he’s going to get into trouble.' 'I would like to ask him about Bitcoin. This man is Satoshi Nakamoto,' said reporter Leah McGrath Goodman. Unprecedented: A Newsweek article claimed to have discovered the real identity of the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto - the long rumored inventor of bitcoin . 'What?' the officer responded. 'This is the guy who created Bitcoin? It looks like he’s living a pretty humble life.' Nakamoto is a Japanese-American descended from Samurai who born in July 1949 in the city of Beppu, Japan, where he was brought up poor and as a Buddhist by his mother. She migrated to California in 1959 bringing Satoshi with him and he graduated from California State Polytechnic University at the age 0f 23. For the past 40-years he has not used his birth name and in 1973 changed his name to Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto. He signs his name Dorian S. Nakamoto. The name Nakamoto appeared in the 2008 whitepaper introducing bitcoin, but the moniker was widely believed to be an alias for a person or group. After he graduated, Nakamoto began work at Hughes Aircraft in southern California where he settled down and got married - having a son named Eric Nakamoto, who now works as an animation and 3-D graphics designer in Philadelphia. He divorced his first wife, remarried and had a further five children with his second wife Grace Mitchell, 56, who lives in Aubodon, New Jersey. She said that he came to the East Coast after leaving Hughes Aircraft, which is now part of defense contractor Raytheon when he was in his late 20s and then worked for Radio Corporation of America in Camden, as a systems engineer. 'We were doing defensive electronics and communications for the military, government aircraft and warships, but it was classified and I can't really talk about it,' confirmed David Micha, president of the company now called L-3 Communications to Newsweek. Unmasked:  Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by a person or group of people operating under the name Satoshi Nakamoto - and now Newsweek magazine claim this man is him . Nakamoto and Grace separated in 2000, but have never divorced. She said he worked as a software engineer for the Federal Aviation Administration in New Jersey after 9/11 in security and communications work. 'It was very secret,' she said to Newsweek. 'He left that job sometime in 2001 and I don't think he's had a steady job since.' Since bitcoin was launched in 2009, the hunt has been on for the real Satoshi Nakamoto. Theories about him have abounded online. Was the creation solely his or was he working for some kind of sinister New World Order global conspiracy? Bitcoin has been associated with the shadier aspects of the National Security Agency and the International Monetary Fund. Bitcoin is a virtual currency that can be delivered like email anywhere on Earth without bank or exchange fees and is stored on cellphones or hard drives until it is used again. However, the money can be lost if the hard drive simply malfunctions or if the bitcoin is stolen by hackers. According to Newsweek, they tracked Nakamoto down after finding he had posted onto website forums for model train enthusiasts. He corresponded with the reporter about his love of trains until she asked about his involvement in bitcoin. 'He has been buying train parts from Japan and England since he was a teenager, saying, ‘I do machining myself, manual lathe, mill, surface grinders,’ Goodman wrote about the mystery man. Media scrum: If this man is Satoshi Nakamoto - he could be worth upwards of $657 million in bitcoins he has failed to cash in since the launch of the digital currency . Amazingly, Newsweek claims that no one in Nakamoto's family even knew that their relative could have written the code for bitcoin. They spoke to his brother Arthut Nakamoto, an engineer at a California firm that makes radio parts. 'You want to know about my amazing physicist brother? He’s a brilliant man. I’m just a humble engineer. He’s very focused and eclectic in his way of thinking. Smart, intelligent, mathematics, engineering, computers. You name it, he can do it,' he told the magazine, adding a warning. 'My brother is an a–hole. What you don’t know about him is that he’s worked on classified stuff. His life was a complete blank for a while. You’re not going to be able to get to him. He’ll deny everything. He’ll never admit to starting Bitcoin,' he said before hanging up. Bitcoin is now in the hands of a nonprofit trust called the Bitcoin Foundation, which includes their chief scientist and code writer, Gavin Andresen, 47. 'The whole reason geeks get excited about Bitcoin is that it is the most efficient way to do financial transactions,' said Andresen to Newsweek. Nakamoto's relatives did allude to his motivations for creating the currency when they said he may have written the code because of his frustration with bankruptcies in the past and paying high fees online when buying model train parts from England. Andresen began work with bitcoin in 2010 and admits to corresponding with the founder of the currency, who he knew as a man named Satoshi Nakamoto, a few times a week only on email. Their interactions, he says, always took place by 'email or private message'. The public eye: The bitcoin community are not convinced of the claim. Bitcoin's lead developer, Gavin Andresen, who is quoted extensively in the Newsweek piece, claimed he is 'disappointed Newsweek decided to dox the Nakamoto family', and that he 'regret talking to Leah'. 'He was the kind of person who, if you made an honest mistake, he might call you an idiot and never speak to you again,' Andresen said to Newsweek. 'Back then, it was not clear that creating Bitcoin might be a legal thing to do. He went to great lengths to protect his anonymity.' According to Newsweek, the Nakamoto that Andresen spoke to never answered any questions on where he was from, his professional background or any other projects that he had worked on. He never even divulged if his name was real of a pseudonym. Andresen said working with Nakamoto could be difficult. 'He was the kind of person who, if you made an honest mistake, he might call you an idiot and never speak to you again,' he said. 'He doesn’t like the system we have today and wanted a different one that would be more equal. He did not like the notion of banks and bankers getting wealthy just because they hold the keys,' Andresen said. Over the course of the interview, Nakamoto's family described him as 'extremely intelligent, moody and obsessively private, a man of few words who screens his phone calls, anonymizes his emails and, for most of his life, has been preoccupied with the two things for which Bitcoin has now become known: money and secrecy.' Attention: Newsweek's Leah McGrath Goodman spent two months trying to track down the founder of the buzzy 'cryptocurrency' -- known by the assumed pseudonym 'Satoshi Nakamoto' Neither family nor any colleagues could or would say why Nakamoto has remained so secretive about his work — and the millions he has made from Bitcoin. Andresen speculated that he simply wanted to keep flying under the radar. 'If you come out as the leader of Bitcoin, now you have to make appearances and presentations and comments to the press and that didn’t really fit with Satoshi’s personality,' he told the magazine. Whoever, the real Satoshi Nakamoto is, that individual sitting on a fortune. A Bitcoin wallet under his name contains 1 million Bitcoins—$657 million USD at current exchange rates—that haven't been touched since Bitcoin's inception. Newsweek speculates the reason he hasn't spent it is because doing so could have compromised his anonymity. Another reason is that he doesn't want to attract the attention of the IRS. One thing is now clear: If this is the genuine bitcoin inventor, his life might never be the same again now that his true identity has been revealed.","Investigation tracks down the mysterious founder of bitcoin known online as Satoshi Nakamoto .

"By . Sam Webb . A mother has spoken of her daughter's devastation after a police helicopter was called to her 15th birthday party when hundreds of youths turned up thanks to a Facebook post. Dozens of officers were sent to the disturbance at Bernard Manning’s Embassy Club in Harpurhey, Manchester. Staff called in police after the venue became overrun by more than 250 revellers at a 100-guest private function held for the teenager, who lives a short distance from the venue.

A police helicopter was called to the party, which was reportedly overrun by 250 youngsters. File picture . The club took the . decision to close early as the . venue reached capacity. More than a dozen police cars and . tactical aid unit vans raced to the scene at around 10.30pm on Saturday . as revellers spilled out into Rochdale Road and reportedly began making trouble outside. The teenager's mother Kim said the teenager had organised and paid for the event herself. 'She was devastated,' Ms Jones told the MailOnline. 'She got up on stage and said ""don't be disrespectful, if you're going to be rowdy please leave"". 'She was gutted (when the event was cancelled) but she would rather it get closed down than get out of control.' Police spent around 45 minutes calming the situation and dispersing the crowd. No arrests were made and no crimes were reported. A file picture of Bernard Manning outside the Embassy Club in Manchester. Police were called there after a party for a 15 year old girl span out of control on Saturday . Mrs Jones said the staff at the Embassy Club handled the situation well. She said: 'They have never done a 15th birthday party before, they did it as a favour. 'The party got out on Facebook, it was just one of those things - it got completely out of control. 'The venue wasn't at fault at all. When the numbers got too high they shut the doors. 'There were people outside but they were just being rowdy, there weren't any fights.' Controversial comedian Bernard Manning, who died in 2007, first made his name as a singer and compere in working men's clubs and comedy clubs in the north, gradually introducing more jokes into his act. He opened the venue in 1959 and was the chief performer for 40 years until he had a stroke in 1999. Manning achieved fame across the UK when he made his television debut in the 1970s on Granada TV's stand-up comedy show The Comedians. Famous musicians to have performed at the club include The Beatles, Johnny Cash and Cilla Black. His son, Bernard Manning Junior now runs the venue. Chief Supt Nick Adderley, of Greater . Manchester Police, said: 'The licensee took the decision to close the . venue and some fighting broke out on the road outside. 'We . responded quickly to the reports and made sure the crowds were . dispersed away from the club as quickly as possible before things . escalated any further.' Local councillor Pat Karney witnessed the 'mayhem' as he returned home and is to write to GMP Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy calling for an inquiry. He said: 'It was a scene of complete mayhem and as we were there, police car after police car was racing towards the area. 'It is very concerning how a 15th birthday party has got so out of hand that such a large amount of police resources have been needed to get the situation under control.' Linda Gray, 44, who lives on Rochdale Road, said: 'At first I thought it was some sort of riot, there were more police than I’ve ever seen in one place at one time and there were hundreds of people, mainly young men, who looked quite intimidating and like they were spoiling for a fight.' One teenager who was at the party said: 'It was pure carnage for a few minutes and people were either kicking off or running off down Rochdale Road.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A large gas grill exploded at a church barbecue on Monday, killing a man operating it at the time, authorities said. The victim was identified as Doug Gripp, 52, of Carmel, Indiana, a married father of two young daughters. The explosion at Grace Community Church in Noblesville was felt by others preparing for a cookout, Police Lt. Bruce Barnes said. The cause of the blast was not immediately known. Man of faith: Doug Gripp, 52, was killed after his large gas grill exploded while he prepared food at a church barbecue in Indiana . Explosion: Police blocked the road leading to the church as fire investigators worked to find out what caused the explosion . 'We're still looking into the reasons as . to why. We're not going to have the answers today, tomorrow or maybe . even the weeks to come,' Lt Barnes said. Senior Pastor Dave Rodriguez said the victim was a 'very beloved volunteer' in the men's ministry. 'We're in shock,' Mr Rodriguez added. The pastor described the grill as being larger than ones typically found at homes. He said it was owned by Mr Gripp. The church draws about 5,000 worshippers each week, he said. Noblesville is about 20 miles northeast of Indianapolis. About 400 men were expected to attend the cookout, which was canceled after the explosion, Rodriguez said. Prayers: The church in Noblesville draws a congregation of around 5,000 every week . Shock: Pastor Dave Rodriguez said that the 52-year-old father was a 'very beloved' volunteer . The pastor wrote on the church's website: 'Doug was a committed Men of Grace volunteer and a member of the Covenant . Community, the membership body of Grace. This is an unbelievably heart-wrenching situation, and we don’t understand why it happened. 'What we do know is that even in the darkest and most confusing circumstances, God loves us, and He is with us. Together with Doug’s family, we desperately cling to these truths in prayer and faith.' It was the second tragedy to rock a central Indiana church in less than a month. A bus owned by Colonial Hills Baptist Church in Indianapolis crashed exiting a highway July 27, killing a youth pastor, his wife and a third member of that congregation.","Victim identified as Doug Gripp, 52, of Carmel, Indiana, a married father of two young daughters .

"By . Mail Online Reporter . Troubled Olympic swimming legend Ian Thorpe was taken to hospital today after he was discovered 'acting oddly' in the street near his parents' home. Police were called to the street in Panania, south of Sydney, at around 3.15am by a neighbour who had seen a man behaving oddly near a vehicle. According to a report, officers found Thorpe, 31, sitting in his car a short distance away. He was taken to hospital for a medical assessment. Neighbours called police after seeing a man behaving suspiciously in the street: Officers discovered Ian Thorpe and he was taken to hospital . Back to the start: After spending nearly 18 months in Switzerland, Mr Thorpe returned to Australia just before Christmas and has been staying with his parents in Sydney . A police spokesman said: 'Emergency services were called to a home in Panania about 3.15am after concerns were raised about a man seen near a vehicle. 'Police spoke to a man (who) was taken to hospital for a medical assessment. No official complaint has been made and no further police action is anticipate.' Thorpe has spoken of his battle with depression and alcohol and last week an Australian newspaper claimed that he was in rehab. However, his management later said that this was not true and he had been treated in hospital for a shoulder injury. ‘Following a fall at home on Tuesday, Ian was admitted to hospital after sustaining an injury to his shoulder,' said a spokesman. 'He underwent surgery on Wednesday and was discharged the following day.' The spokesman went on: 'On Sunday (Australian time) Ian was taken to Bankstown Hospital and then onto a rehabilitation clinic after being found disorientated and trying to get in to what he thought was a friend’s car. 'Ian had been on a series of pain killers and anti-depressants following surgery on his shoulder. No alcohol was involved and Ian was admitted to rehabilitation for his ongoing struggle with depression.' The five-time Olympic gold medallist wrote about his battle with 'crippling depression' in his 2013 biography. He revealed that at some of the worst times he turned to alcohol in a bid to quell the thoughts running about his head. Success: Thorpe, seen with his gold medal after winning the 200-meter freestyle at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, the records of most Olympic gold medals won by an Australian . The 31-year-old dominated the shorter freestyle distances for several years after winning his first World Championship in 1998, aged 14 . The swimmer said he also felt the need to stay silent about his depression, thinking it was a 'character flaw'. 'Not even my family is aware that I've spent a lot of my life battling what I can only describe as a crippling depression.’ He admits in the book that he is ready to speak to his parents about his depression, but this is the first time he has been reported to have sought treatment. ‘Yes, it's serious but there's not a lot I can or want to add,’ broadcaster Alan Jones, a close friend of Ian Thorpe told the Herald Sun. ‘Ian is a beautiful person but he has difficulty recognising his problems.’ After becoming the world's youngest male World Champion in the 1998 Perth World Championships, he dominated the shorter freestyle distances for several years. He still holds the records of most Olympic gold medals won by an Australian (five) and became the first person to win six golds in one championship in 2001. He took a break from swimming in 2004, after the Athens Olympics, but failed to make a comeback two years later due to illness and chose instead to retire. He attempted a comeback ahead of the London 2012 Olympics but only made it to the second day of Australia's Olympic Trials in Adelaide, and instead worked as a pundit for the BBC during the games. Shortly after London 2012 he moved to Switzerland, but returned to Australia in December last year.","Officers called out after neighbours spotted man behaving oddly .

"By . Mark Prigg . Anyone who has ventured into the blocky virtual world of Minecraft quickly realises the size of the massively popular online game. But for one user, finding out exactly how big it is has become an obsession. Kurt Mac hopes to reach the edge of the game, a murky area only referred to by the game's creator as 'the Far Lands' - even though he expects it to take 25 years. Scroll down for video . Journey to the end of the world: One of the furthest points in Minecraft reached by Kurt Mac. He hopes to reach the edge of the game, a murky area only referred to by the game's creator as 'the Far Lands' - even though he expects it to take 25 years. Available on everything from smartphones to games consoles, Minecraft is a virtual world made up of square blocks of various materials. Players can break down and build structures through farming and mining. Each game generates a brand new world populated with a unique configuration of trees, plains and mountains, making it ideal for exploring. The world continues to automatically generate as the player moves further away from its centre - although its creators have warned of the Far Lands, where the game's code may begin to break down. Mac began his quest three years ago, in March 2011. He loaded up a new game, chose a direction and started walking - and has covered over 700km since. His aim if to get to and area of the game Minecraft creator Markus Persson has called the 'Far Lands,' so far from the center of the world that the game can no longer support the size of the world . Recently, he turned the quest into a walk-a-thon for Child's Play Charity, and has so far raised over $160,000. 'I began my YouTube series as a standard Minecraft Let's Play, where I built a settlement, searched for resources and explored the area around my spawn point,' he said. 'After a while I grew impatient and in the 11th episode of the series decided to pack some essential supplies and head West with the goal of reaching these mysterious Far Lands. Another shot of the journey so far, revealing snowy peaks. A map of the journey so far, showing each rest stop as a block - so far over 700km has been covered . 'I vowed to make my attempt for the Far Lands without the aid of any mods or cheats, and I have also decided to utilize the popularity of my expedition and turn it into a fundraiser for the Child's Play charity!' One of the biggest snags to hit the virtual expedition was when Micrcrafts creators removed the Far Lands . 'Unfortunately, the Far Lands were removed from the game when the new terrain generation code was released in an update on September 12th, 2011,' he admitted. However, he vowed not to upgrade. 'Fear not, fellow Farlanders! I will continue the expedition in Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 for as long as I must!' So far the Minecraft world has remained stable - but there are fears it could develop bugs as the game's limits approach. On his journey, Mac is armed with a sword and a pickaxe, and is accompanied by his trusted companion Wolfie, a tamed wolf he found in the game. He narrates each episode of his series. The series transformed into a sort of podcast, where the topics I talk about might have little to do with the journey itself,' he told the New Yorker. 'Of course, it is always exciting when Minecraft re-grabs my attention with a perilous cliff, a zombie attack, or a memorable landscape, and I remember the journey I’m on.'","Kurt Mac has already travelled 700 virtual km in the game .

"By . Mark Duell . 'Too common for telly': Business reporter Steph McGovern, 31, said she encountered prejudice from bosses before she landed her on-screen role . A BBC presenter has claimed she receives ‘abuse’ from viewers because of her northern accent. Steph McGovern, 31, who is originally from Middlesbrough and presents business news on BBC Breakfast, said her ‘strong northern accent’ still elicits disparaging remarks from viewers. She added that she encountered prejudice from bosses before she landed her on-screen role. Miss McGovern told the Radio Times: ‘Despite being a business journalist at the BBC for 10 years, working behind the scenes on our high-profile news programmes, I was viewed by some in the organisation to be “too common for telly”. ‘I remember at the end of one BBC job interview being told by the manager, “I didn't realise people like you were clever”. Sad, but true.’ The presenter added: ‘You would think that after nearly two years in the job, people would be used to my Teesside tones. 'To be fair most are, but there are still some viewers who can't accept that someone with my accent can have a brain. It means that I regularly get abuse about it. ‘I've had tweets questioning whether I really did go to university because surely I would have lost my accent if I did; a letter suggesting, very politely, that I get correction therapy; and an email saying I should get back to my council estate and leave the serious work to the clever folk.’ Miss McGovern said: ‘It's inevitable . that not everyone will like me. All presenters deal with that.

Former Today programme presenter Edward Stourton was forced out of his job amid suggestions his accent was 'too posh' In the 1950s, having a 'BBC accent' meant that you spoke RP, or the Queen's English, without a trace of a regional accent. More recently, however, speaking this way could do you out of a job at the corporation. In 2008 BBC Radio 4 Today presenter Edward Stourton was sacked by the BBC amid suggestions he sounded 'too posh'. Embarrassed executives insisted that the hugely experienced presenter, who was educated at Ampleforth and Cambridge, and who presented the flagship news programme for a decade, was leaving to 'pursue other projects' and that modern listeners wanted a 'more light-hearted' style of presenting. However Stourton disputed this, saying: 'I am leaving because they have removed me and there are no other projects.'  He went on to present The World At One and The World This Weekend as well as Sunday, R4's main religious and current affairs news programme. In 2010 the BBC nailed its colours to the mast when Jana Bennett, director of BBC Vision, said the corporation needed to 'increase the amount of network TV content which offers distinctive voices with an authentic sense of place.' She said more work should be done to ensure the BBC's output accurately reflected the UK's nations and regions, but insisted 'accents on their own' were not enough to make people from different parts of the UK feel represented. The following year the BBC Trust said that R4 should 'give greater exposure to presenters from the North'.","Steph McGovern, 31, presents business news on BBC Breakfast .

"By . Martha De Lacey . The author behind the psychological thriller of the summer, Gone Girl, has said her book about a marriage turning sour was inspired by her own successful marriage, and that her lawyer husband was, in fact, her 'muse'. Gillian Flynn, a pop culture journalist-turned-horror author, said her third book is so intensely creepy ('my goal is to make spouses look askance at each other') thanks entirely to partner Brett Nolan giving her licence to write anything she liked. Speaking to Oliver Burkeman in the Guardian, Flynn, 42, said she wrote the book  - which has now sold over 2m copies worldwide - when the couple, who have a young son, were very newly married. Gone Girl is the third novel by Chicago-based writer and mother-of-one Gillian Flynn, who says it was inspired by her marriage to lawyer Brett Nolan . She said: 'The funny thing, I guess is that my . husband ended up being the muse of a book about the worst marriage in . the world, because if he hadn't consistently said, ""Don't censor . yourself, don't worry about me"" - if he'd been anxious and worried about . it - then it would never have gotten written.' Gone Girl  - which follows Flynn's first books Sharp Objects (2007) and Dark Places (2010) - tells the story of a marriage gone horribly wrong, and questions whether you can ever truly know the person with whom you share your life. Set in Missouri, on the fifth wedding anniversary of 'perfect' couple Nick and Amy Dunne, the novel begins when Nick comes home to find his beautiful, trust-fund wife missing from their home amid and evidence of a struggle. Enter the police, the media, and Amy's overbearing parents - along with some revealing entries from the missing woman's  diary - and Nick finds he must defend himself against accusations. Fynn, who grew up obsessed with horror films as a child in Kansas ('I watched Psycho a million times') and trained as a crime reporter, says people who have read her books expect her to be a sociopath, but that mystery writers actually tend to be the 'sanest and nicest people'. The former pop culture writer, who was fired from her job at Entertainment Weekly in 2009 due to budget cuts, added: 'It seems like the darker the books are, the nicer the person is. People say it's the romance writers you've got to watch out for.' Actress Reese Witherspoon, left, will produce the film version of Gone Baby, and David Fincher, the man behind Fight Club, Seven and Panic Room, is rumoured to be taking the directing chair . While Gone Girl has been accused of misogyny (female characters in her writing are seldom very palatable), Flynn insists she is a feminist... just one who is wants to push against the idea that women are intrinsically loving and kind. She is 'weary of spunky heroines'. She wants to make her ladies ugly. She said: 'In literature they can be bad - trampy, vampy, bitchy types - but there's still a big pushback against the idea that women can be just pragmatically evil, bad and selfish.' Reese Witherspoon saw something she understood in that sentiment. The actress is to produce the film version of the screenplay Flynn has written for the book, while David Fincher, the man behind Fight Club, Panic Room and Seven, is rumoured to be directing.","Gone Girl is a gripping psychological thriller about a missing wife .

"By . Simon Walters . Fighting back: Deselected Tim Yeo was criticised for earning £400,000 in green energy interests . Tory Tim Yeo’s hopes of avoiding the sack as an MP suffered a setback last night after three fellow grandees piled the pressure on him. Mr Yeo has been criticised for earning £400,000 from green energy interests since 2009 while chairing the Commons Energy and Climate Change Select Committee since 2010. Now three fellow Tory MPs – who also chair Commons select committees – have distanced themselves from Mr Yeo, fighting to overturn a decision by local party chiefs to deselect him as Suffolk South MP. Mr Yeo’s neighbouring North Essex MP, Bernard Jenkin, has backed moves to force MPs to give up all commercial interests linked to committee work. And he refuses to add his name to MPs calling on Mr Yeo’s activists to save him in a ballot on his future. And Tory MP James Arbuthnot said he is stepping down as Commons Defence Select Committee head to pursue outside interests in defence as staying on as chairman would be ‘wrong and a conflict of interests’. Tory John Whittingdale, who leads the Culture, Media And Sport Committee, has indicated he is unwilling to back Mr Yeo and believes Commons committee chairmen should not have ‘substantial earnings’ linked to their political duties. Mr Yeo, who will be 70 at the next Election, was deselected over claims he spends too little time in his constituency and abused his position as chairman of his Commons committee. The result of a ballot of 600 local activists on whether to overturn the decision will be announced on February 3. A report looking into select committee chairman 'affected his reputation' Mr Jenkin said: ‘Committee chairman who . scrutinise Whitehall departments and evaluate policies should not have . outside interests directly connected to those matters. 'That is one of the reasons I have no such outside interests. Parliament’s rules must be more sensitive to avoid conflicts of interest.’ The first steps towards a crackdown on committee chairmen such as Mr Yeo cashing in on outside interests linked to their political roles came in a report by the Commons Standards Committee last week. Set back: Fellow MPs including John Whittingdale have indicated they are unwilling to back Mr Yeo . It referred to comments about Mr Yeo by Parliamentary Standards Commissioner Kathryn Hudson, who led last year’s inquiry into his conduct. She said he had not broken any rules but the affair had ‘affected his reputation’. She expressed ‘concerns about the external perception of the relationship between an MP’s outside employment and interests and his work for the Commons’. She was backing an initiative by Speaker John Bercow who said there was ‘an inherent incompatibility between chairing a select committee and having commercial interests in the sector covered by that committee’. South Suffolk Tory executive member Simon Barrett said: ‘Many people will agree wholeheartedly with these three senior Conservatives. Dissatisfaction with Mr Yeo has grown over a long time. People are tired of his arrogant attitude.’ Mr Yeo insists he was ‘totally exonerated’ by the report into claims he abused his job running the Climate Change Committee. David Cameron yesterday added his name to Tory MPs backing Mr Yeo, who said last night he would abide by any changes in the rules for committee chairman approved by the Commons, though had no plans to give up his ‘green’ interests until then. He said: ‘In more than 30 years as an MP I have always abided by the rules of the House.’","Three fellow MPs who chair select committees fight to deselect him .

Police arrested the 19-year-old suspect yesterday, after the 80-year-old Sikh man was punched in the face and shoved to the ground in Coventry city centre in broad daylight last Saturday. Video footage of the sickening attack, which showed a female assailant spitting on the elderly victim, had been circulated widely on social media and met with a wave of revulsion from viewers. The man, 80, was punched in the face and shoved to the ground in broad daylight in Trinity Street in Coventry city centre last Saturday . Captured by a witness using a mobile phone, the footage shows the man left sprawled on the pavement, his turban having fallen off. The teenage suspect was arrested at around 6.30pm yesterday after police traced her to an address in Gloucester. Officers said she would be taken to a local police station for questioning. Coventry Police chief superintendent Andy Nicholson, said: 'This was a despicable, violent attack on an elderly man in broad daylight. 'The victim is an 80-year-old man - he was left with a bloodied nose and a black eye. Suspect: Police arrested the 19-year-old on Friday evening after she was traced to an address in Gloucester (file photo) 'A video showing the assault spread rapidly on social media and quite rightly the offender's actions are being condemned by everyone who's viewed it.' The attack, which appears to have been unprovoked, happened at around 8.30pm near Sainsbury's in Coventry's Trinity Street. Police are still keen to hear from people who witnessed the incident and moments leading up to the attack and have urged anyone who shared the video or still images of the assault to remove them from social media accounts as they could hinder the inquiry.

Two 12-year-old Chinese girls have killed themselves in bizarre circumstances after leaving suicide notes saying they believed their deaths would enable them to travel back in time.

Fateful fiction: The girls were apparently inspired to commit suicide because of a desire to travel back in time. Some believe they were influenced by time travel TV . Time travel TV shows like this, have been blamed for inspiring young Chinese children to commit suicide in the hope of visiting 'the past' They each wrote suicide notes and hid them in a cupboard before jumping into a pond to drown themselves. In a message left by one of the girls, Xiao Mei, she said her friend, Xiao Hua, was terrified of being punished for misplacing the remote control to the rolling door of her house in Zhangzhou.

Healthy fish can grow up to 4ft over decades and investors tend to go for examples with a broad, blunt-nosed head and a thick well-muscled tail. The skin should be even-textured. There are 13 basic varieties with the Kohaku the most popular. These are white with red 'beni' (spotted) patterns. The most collectible have deep, uniform shading. However, find one with a Japanese 'sun' on its forehead and you might have a fish worth tens of thousands of pounds.","Tourists at a market in Ayutthaya flock to the water's edge to feed the fish .

As part of the smallest species in Europe the owl, which measured about 7in from tip to tail, used its lightning-speed reactions to catch a vole hidden in the deep bank in Oulo, Finland - emerging with the creature after just 15 seconds. The sequence was captured by photographer Jari Peltomaki, 48, as part of a new book about the birds. Scroll down for video . What are you looking at?

'First its head was under the snow when it was looking for vole and it was almost completely covered. 'The whole hunting sequence lasted 15 seconds and the owl looked very satisfied when it flew off with a vole. 'I was thrilled to witness and capture this scene on camera.' Mr Peltomaki's photographs have depicted owls hunting, nesting and even apparently giving the photographer a cheeky wink. The book by Jari Peltomaki and his friend David Tipling focuses on owls.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Certain parts of England have twice as many immigrants as previously thought, revised figures have suggested. There are three times more foreigners in one part of Lincolnshire than previously estimated, while areas in Herefordshire and London have twice as many immigrants. Revised figures from the Office of National Statistics, published this week by the Greater London Authority, have increased the population of London by 130,000, while its immigrant community has gone up by 16 per cent to nearly 950,000. The ONS currently measure the number of immigrants in Britain through voluntary questionnaires filled out at airports and ports . In Boston, Lincolnshire, new statistics show that the number of immigrants in the past five years has trebled to 7,500. While some areas have increased their foreign community as a result of the methodology change, other council areas have seen the number reduced by as much as half. Cambridge, Norwich and Durham all saw their immigrant community numbers reduced. The number of foreigners coming to live, study or work in Britain is currently based on a questionnaire which is filled in at airports and ports, while detailed estimates of where new arrivals settle have been calculated in different ways. The methodology employed by the ONS . sees migrants separated into 'streams', depending on their age and . employment status, and their movements are followed using education, . welfare and health registers. The revised totals, as published by the GLA, have highlighted an apparent shift in the spread of immigrants across the capital . In Newham, east London, there was a 102 per cent rise in the number of immigrants, while Herefordshire (180 per cent) and Aylesbury Vale (104 per cent), also recorded sharp rises. Overall, the estimated number of immigrants arriving for more than 12 months between 2006 and 2010 decreased by 0.4 per cent, to just over 2.5million, under the new system. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of Migration Watch UK, told the Telegraph: 'The impact of immigration on London has been revised up by 130,000 to very nearly one million in just five years. 'This is a measure of the huge churn in our population as a result of mass immigration which has serious consequences for our schools, housing and health services.' The revised ONS figures have not been officially adopted by the Government and have not yet affected local funding levels, partly because more reliable population data will soon be available from the recent census.

"By . Ruth Styles . He's photographed everyone from Jerry Hall and Kate Moss to Mick Jagger and Damon Albarn but David Bailey has no plans to start putting himself in his celebrity portraits. Speaking at the launch of his new retrospective at the National Portrait Gallery, Bailey, 76, revealed that he 'couldn't see the point' of selfies and condemned the trend as 'just another craze'. He also said he expected to see the end of the selfie in the not too distant future, adding: 'It's just a silly moment and people won't be doing it in six months. There will be another craze.' Definitely not a selfie: A self-portrait taken during Bailey's period of National Service in Singapore, 1957 . Glamorous: A glossy portrait of model Jerry Hall  and late photographer Helmut Newton in Cannes in 1973 . Stunning: Blur singer Damon Albarn, photographed in 2007, and a portrait of Kate Moss taken in 2013 . Although Bailey, who says he is too busy taking photographs of other people to take selfies, might not approve, the craze has so far found favour with celebrities and political leaders alike. Last year, David Cameron caused controversy when he was spotted posing for a selfie with Barack Obama and Danish premier Helle Thorning-Schmidt during Nelson Mandela's memorial service. Other celebrity fans of the selfie include Justin Bieber, Harry Styles, Rihanna and Madonna, all of whom regularly post self-portraits on social media sites. Although there are no selfies, the retrospective, Bailey's Stardust, does include plenty of A-list portraits, among them iconic shots of Kate Moss, Damian Albarn and Jerry Hall. The 250 works on show at the National Portrait Gallery also include portraits of many of his former wives and lovers, among them French . actress Catherine Deneuve and model Marie Helvin.

Bailey's Stardust also sheds light on a less well-known part of his oeuvre - a series of documentary photos taken in India and Papua New Guinea that, for all their beauty, have been largely overshadowed by his celebrity work. Speaking about the exhibition, Sandy . Nairne, director of the National Portrait Gallery, London, commented: . ‘Bailey’s Stardust is a very special event.

"By . Luke Salkeld . Gazing into the camera, Dana the orang-utan cradles her newborn daughter protectively. It is a remarkable image, made all the more remarkable by the fact that it would not have existed at all without the pioneering fertility treatment Dana received from an obstetrician whose usual patients are human. Experts had feared the 25-year-old Sumatran ape, who lives at Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust in Jersey, would never conceive again. Scroll down for preview . Bond: Dana cuddles her newborn baby in never-before-seen footage of a Sumatran orangutan giving birth . Look of love: The footage of the birth was taken at Jersey's Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust . She had suffered a stillbirth in 2009, which left her with blocked fallopian tubes. But Neil MacLachlan, head obstetrician at Jersey General Hospital, was determined to make Dana a mother. The reproductive system of the orang-utan is very similar to that of a woman, and Mr  MacLachlan had been called in to carry out a caesarean section on one at the trust ten years before. He volunteered his services for Dana, and over the next few years performed several operations to help clear the blockages. His treatment – believed to be a world first – resulted in the birth of M3236, as the baby is officially known, on June 9. See the birth on BBC One Sunday July 14, 3.30pm. Find out more here . Historic: It is believed to be the first time a live orangutan birth has been filmed . Conservation: The remarkable footage features in BBC documentary Refugees Of The Lost Rain Forest . Mother and child: Dana relaxes in the long grass while cradling her newborn infant . In another first, it was filmed for BBC documentary Refugees Of The Lost Rain Forest, using a camera hidden in a wooden box. After a labour lasting an hour and three quarters, Dana delivered the baby herself, cleared her airways with her mouth and checked her new daughter’s fingers and toes. Knowing she was being observed by the park’s staff, she went over to her trusted keeper and showed him the baby. She is being referred to temporarily as Harta, which means ‘gift’. A permanent name will be chosen by a member of the public in a competition. Holding tight: The orangutan seemingly refuses to let go of her infant as she soaks up the sunshine . Infertile: It was believed Dana could not have more children but obstetrician Neil MacLachlan intervened and she gave birth to the adorable infant this year . Mr MacLachlan, 57, said: ‘The reproductive organs of an orang-utan and a human are virtually identical. You’d be hard pushed  to tell the difference at all. An orang-utan’s fallopian tubes are slightly shorter.’ He added: ‘It was fantastic we were able to help Dana get pregnant. ‘We were worried throughout her pregnancy because of her previous stillbirth and regularly monitored her using ultrasound, but luckily it all went extremely well.’ A spokesman for the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust said: ‘The baby is big and strong and healthy – very awake and alert. ‘Dana is a great mother. We see it as a miracle.’ Refugees Of The Lost Rain Forest will be broadcast on BBC One South West on July 14, but will also be available on BBC iPlayer.","Dana gave birth to baby at Jersey's Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust .

"By . Damien Gayle . It's a question that has exercised the greatest minds on the internet, but until now there has been no definitive answer. How tall can tower of Lego be built before the bricks at the bottom buckle under the strain? Now engineers at the Open University have finally come up with the solution to the conundrum and, here's a clue, its probably going to be bigger than you think. Scroll down for video . Record-breaking: The world's tallest Lego tower standing in front of Jamsil Stadium in Seoul in May . The question was initially posed on social news site Reddit, where it ignited a burning debate that attracted nearly 1,200 comments. But it is thanks to the BBC that the answer was found after Radio 4's More or Less programme asked academics to get into their labs and test it out on a hydraulic press. Dr Ian Johnston, an applied mathematician and lecturer in engineering, told the broadcaster: 'It's an exciting thing to do because it's an entirely new question and new questions are always interesting.' It's already known that Lego is extremely resilient, with the company this Spring enlisting 4,000 South Korean children to erecting a record-breaking tower in Seoul measuring a dizzying 105ft high. But every building material has some theoretical limit beyond which it cannot be used and, before even higher Lego towers can be built, it would be sensible how much the plastic bricks can suffer. Lab conditions: A team from the Open University's Engineering Department put a 2x2 Lego brick on a hydraulic press then measured how much pressure it was able to take before buckling under the stress . To work out how tall a tower can be . built before it crushes itself, researchers need to find out two things: . the total mass of the building material used and its yield strength. This . latter factor is how much pressure a material can take before it . breaks. To find it out Dr Johnston's team took a vulnerable-looking 2x2 . Lego brick and placed it on a metal plate atop a hydraulic ram. 'Plastic failure': This is how a 2x2 Lego brick looks after a load of 432kg pushes down on to it . Across . the brick they placed a second plate attached to a load cell to measure . the force pushing upwards. Then they put on safety glasses and slowly . backed away. Ratcheting up the pressure on the . hydraulic testing machine, they sailed past 3,500 Newtons of force, . which is the equivalent of having 350kg (a third of a tonne) pushing . down on the brick. Eventually . the load reached a phenomenal 4,240 Newtons - equivalent to 432kg - and . the brick slowly began to deform after reaching what Dr Johnston . explained was its 'material failure'. 'The material is just flowing out of the way now and it's not able to take any more. We're getting a plastic failure,' he said. 'It means the brick keeps on deforming, without the load increasing. Metals can be plastic, and this plastic is being plastic.' Repeating the experiment showed again that the average 2x2 Lego brick, each made of ABS plastic, can carry a mass of 432kg. Once that figure was known, working out how high a Lego tower could be was easy. With an average 2x2 Lego brick having a mass of 1.152g and the total mass a single brick can carry being 432kg, dividing the former by the latter gives the grand total of bricks a single Lego brick can support: 375,000. Multiply that by the height of the brick - 9.6mm - and it turns out that, theoretically, a tower of Lego 3.5km (2.17 miles) could be built before the one at the bottom has any problems.

'So if the Greek gods wanted to build a new temple on Mount Olympus, and Mount Olympus wasn't available, they could just - but no more - do it with Lego bricks,' he added.

"By . William Turvill . Three gypsies have been arrested on suspicion of child abduction. It comes days after a Roma couple on the mainland was charged with abducting 'Maria' (pictured) Three Greek gypsies have been arrested on suspicion of child abduction days after another Roma couple were charged with abducting a girl known as 'Maria'. The Roma were arrested today on the Aegean island of Lesvos, with police saying the trio allegedly tried to register the two-month-old boy as their own. Suspicions were raised because they lacked sufficient documentation. Regional police chief Panagiotis . Kordonouris said a 19-year-old woman, 21-year-old man and his . 51-year-old mother were arrested at a settlement outside the island's . capital, Mytilini. He told Associated Press they claimed an unknown Roma woman gave them the baby in Athens. 'They told us they didn’t give her any money, and that they met by accident,' he said. 'She told her that she had five children; they said that they are unable to have their own and asked if she could give her one.' Last . week, a Roma couple in the mainland town of Farsala was charged with . abducting the girl known as 'Maria' found living with them. The discovery triggered an international investigation for a possible match with children declared missing as well as an investigation in Greece to check for birth certificate fraud committed in the past six years. The couple, aged 39 and 40, told police and prosecutors they had received the blond girl from a destitute Bulgarian woman and had brought her up with their own five children. They have been charged with abduction and document fraud, and have been jailed awaiting trial. The trio were arrested today on the Greek island of Lesvos (pictured) The international police agency Interpol said it has not matched any cases to the DNA of the girl, who has been placed in temporary care with a Greek charity, Smile of the Child. 'The child is not on any list of missing children, so we believe this clearly demonstrates that this is not a case of kidnapping,' the couple’s lawyer Marietta Palavra told private Skai television. 'All the evidence that is emerging is providing confirmation of what my clients have been saying from the very first moment.'","Gypsies arrested on Aegean island of Lesvos for suspected abduction .

"By . Lucy Crossley . A unit of museum experts tasked with investigating unexplained phenomenon have been left baffled by a mysterious substance, dubbed 'space slime'. Carrying out work which would leave even The X-Files's Fox Mulder and Dana Scully stumped, the team at the Natural History Museum have been tasked with identifying a host of bizarre items discovered by the British public. Among the finds examined by the museum's Identification and Advisory Service was a mysterious slime discovered in a peaceful nature reserve in Somerset. Mysterious: The origins of the 'space slime', discovered at a nature reserve in Somerset, is being investigated by experts at the Natural History Museum's Identification and Advisory Service, established to probe unexplained objects . Secrets of the universe: The strange gloop, found at the Ham Wall nature reserve, mysteriously appeared around the same time as a meteor crashed to earth in Chelyabinsk, Russia . The strange gloop, found at the Ham Wall nature reserve, mysteriously appeared around the same time as a meteor crashed to earth in Chelyabinsk, Russia, and an amateur photographer claimed he had captured a mysterious object whizzing through the sky above the park on camera. The object appeared to be a meteor, although this was not confirmed by astronomers. Nature buffs claimed the slime was merely frogspawn, while others said it was 'star jelly', a strange substance said to appear when meteors fall to earth, which has continued to stump scientists. The London-based museum's Angela Marmont Centre for UK Biodiversity (AMC), which houses the Identification and Advisory Service, was tasked with investigating the mysterious slime, with the aim of establishing whether it had fallen from space, or if its origins were rather more terrestrial. Laboratory tests have so far failed to find just what it could be - and where it had come from. Discovery: The Natural History Museum's Chesca Rogers says the slime is still a genuine mystery . Discovery: The Natural History Museum's Angela Marmont Centre for UK Biodiversity is tasked with identifying unknown objects, such as this rock which a member of the public mistook for a dinosaur skull . Agent Skull-y: The pelvis bones of sea birds, such as auks and puffins, were thought by their imaginative discoverers to be dragon skulls . The tooth is out there: A deer skull was mistaken for that on an ice-age sabre tooth cat because of its long tusks . Scientists from the unit extracted DNA from the jelly and tried to match it against that of birds and frogs, without success. DNA traces of worms and bacteria were found in the substance, but these were not thought to have been the source of the slime, and had more likely come from organisms which colonised the matter. Chesca Rogers, from the AMC, has been working on the mysterious substance since it was sent tothe unit by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which runs the nature reserve where it was found in February. 'The slime is still a genuine mystery,' Ms Rogers told The Daily Telegraph.'There are stories in folklore that link it with meteor sightings. Some people think it might be unfertilised frog spawn, others think it is a fungus, or a slime mould or that it is plant related.'None of the tests we have done so far have told us anything conclusive, but the samples we got were not in the best condition and highly contaminated.' Ms Rogers is set to open up her very own . X-Files this Friday at a museum talk where she will explain how she has . been unravelling the mystery, as well as other examples of the AMC's most intriguing and puzzling cases. Revealing: The secrets of the AMC will be revealed at a talk at the Natural History Museum this week . Mystery: The origins of the 'space slime' might even have left Mulder and Scully from cult television programme The X-Files stumped . The doors at the AMC, located inside the museum's Darwin Centre, are open daily so that people who find strange objects, including fossils, can get help with identifying them. However, some of the mysteries of finds brought to the AMC, which was opened in 2010, by eagle-eyed members of the public have proved easier to solve. The haul has included stones they believe to be the remains of a dinosaur and 'meteorites' that are in fact discarded aluminium foil. A skull believed to have belonged to an ice-age sabre tooth cat, its fur still intact, was instead found to be that of a Chinese Water Deer, thought to have been mistaken for the ancient predator because of its long tusks which could have been mistaken for the cat's powerful incisors. Other animal remains have been mistaken for something even more incredible, such as the pelvis bones of sea birds, such as auks and puffins, which were thought by their imaginative discoverers to be dragon skulls. In one case, which initially appeared to be one for agents Mulder and Scully, an 'alien' in a jar of liquid was brought in, only to be revealed as a science fiction toy. Every year the museum received around around 10,000 inquiries from the public, who are encouraged to bring their finds to the AMC, which is funded by supported by Professor Anthony Marmont, Angela Marmont and John Lyonâ€™s Charity.","Strange substance found in nature reserve thought to be linked to meteor .

"By . Lillian Radulova . Five people were stranded on a rocky island off Australia's central Queensland coast for nine hours before being winched to safety by a rescue helicopter. The group of three men and two women, wrote an enormous 'SOS' message on a nearby sandbank after their boat's anchor broke, leaving them stranded on the island. One of the five people rescued, Keswick Island resident Lyn Forbes-Smith, spoke to The Courier-Mail about the ordeal.Scroll down for video . SOS: Five people were found off the Queensland coast by helicopter after a SOS sand message was noticed on Monday afternoon . She explained that the group had come to terms with the idea that they would have to spend the night stranded on the island, but were confident that friends at home would raise the alarm once they did not return at a set time. 'We had reef walkers on thankfully, but we had no food, water, cream, no hats, not much at all,' Mrs Forbes Taylor said. 'We just looked for the highest ground, we looked for rocks where five of us could huddle together because we didn’t really want to separate, and we wanted to be out of the wind as best as possible.' Queensland Water Police were alerted to a possible emergency when they noticed a six metre boat abandoned and floating between Brampton and Cockermouth islands on Monday afternoon. Rescued: The two women and three men were left stranded after their boat anchor malfunctioned, stranding them on the rocky island they had stopped at to explore . Helicopters rescue crew noticed the SOS message after assisting water police in their search for occupants of an abandoned boat that had been found . After being unable to find the boat's passengers, they contacted the RACQ-CQ Rescue helicopter to help assist in the search at 2:15pm (AEST). It was at this point, more than three hours later,  that the rescuers spotted the SOS message at nearby Wigton Island, where the boat's occupants had originally anchored their vessel in order to go ashore exploring before its anchor faltered, stranding them. The five people were found soon after their message and were lifted off the island via the rescue helicopter and taken to the RACQ-CQ base at the inland Queensland city, Mackay. The group had left Keswick Island at 8am for a snorkeling expedition before anchoring their boat on a sand bar near the rocky outcrop. After setting out to explore the rocky island, the group noticed their boat drifting away in the rising tide but were unable to retrieve the vessel which was traveling fast on the tide. Lost at sea: Queensland Water Police were alerted to a possible emergency when they noticed a six metre boat abandoned and floating between Brampton and Cockermouth islands . With their mobile phones and sun protection left on the departing boat, the group could only head for high ground and wait. 'Just as we got over to the rocks one of the boat co-owners … turned back and could see that the boat had shifted,' Mrs Forbes-Smith said. 'We knew the sandbar would go under but we were fairly confident that the tide wouldn’t have taken over the rocks,' Mrs Forbes-Smith said. Boats were not used in the rescue due to the island being inaccessible because of the shallow waters at the time of rescue. Safe and sound: The boat occupants were lifted off the island via the rescue helicopter and taken to the RACQ-CQ base at the inland Queensland city, Mackay . Aside from some minor sunburn, the boats occupants were confirmed to be safe and in good health after their rescue despite the long ordeal. It was only just over a week ago that a group of three fisherman also required rescuing via chopper off the Mackay coast on April 14. The men, aged 20, 28 and 69 suffered minor injuries after their 15 meter trawler hit the Trogolby Reef, leaving them to spend five hours in the water waiting for help. Rescue teams believed the fishing boat lost control due to the high winds caused by Cyclone Ita.","Three men and two women were stranded after their boat's anchor broke .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . A federal jury sentenced an ex-Marine to death on Thursday for murdering a fellow service member in 2009, one among a series of violent, sexually motivated attacks he committed over the years. Jorge Torrez of Zion, Ill., is the first person since 2007 to be sentenced to death at the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia. After Torrez, 25, was found guilty earlier this month of Navy Petty Officer Amanda Snell's murder, Torrez ordered his lawyers not to put on any defense or question the government's case during the trial's sentencing phase. Ex-Marine Jorge Torrez was sentenced to death on Thursday for murdering fellow service member Amanda Snell . Prosecutors said Torrez not only killed Snell but also murdered two young girls in his hometown of Zion when he was 16. On Thursday, Torrez sat impassively in front of the jury in his green jail jumpsuit, forgoing the civilian clothes he has worn all trial. The jury found Torrez guilty of the murder of Petty Officer Amanda Snell, a Las Vegas native, in 2009 at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall in Arlington, in a barracks where both lived a few doors down from each other. But prosecutor James Trump reminded the jury that the murder of Snell was far from his only crime. Guilt: Torrez is charged with the killing of two young girls in 2005 in his hometown of Zion — 8-year-old Laura Hobbs (left) and 9-year-old Krystal Tobias (right) When Torrez was only 16, prosecutors . say he stabbed and killed two girls, 8-year-old Laura Hobbs and . 9-Year-old Krystal Tobias, in a park in his hometown of Zion. The . crime was especially brutal - jurors saw gruesome photos of Hobbs' body . with stab wounds to the eyes that medical experts concluded occurred . while she was still alive. Semen found on Hobbs was linked by DNA . evidence to Torrez. And . in 2010, Torrez committed a series of stalking attacks on three women . in northern Virginia, including one who was raped, choked and left for . dead. It was Torrez's arrest in those cases that helped investigators . tie him to Snell's murder and the slayings of the two Illinois girls. He . is already serving a life sentence for the Arlington attacks. Until his arrest in Virginia, Trump told jurors, Torrez believed he had literally gotten away with murder. But . Torrez bragged about the killings to another inmate after his arrest in . the Arlington attacks, and prosecutors played recordings of those . confessions to the jury in which he laughed about the killings and . showed no remorse. Trump reminded jurors that Torrez bragged about being 'an army of one' while preying on defenseless children. 'There's no room for doubt. Jorge Torrez deserves to die,' Trump said. Torrez will join 59 other prisoners on federal death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.","Jorge Torrez, 25, has been sentenced to death for the murder of US Navy sailor Amanda Snell .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . What a stink! Turns out more than a one-and-a-half million Americans are without indoor plumbing. According to the latest American Community Survey, nearly 630,000 occupied households lack complete plumbing facilities. It means that they are without one or more of the following: a toilet, a tub or shower, or running water. Just sixty years ago a quarter of American homes had no flushing toilet. Out house: According to a survey more than a million homes lack complete plumbing facilities, which means that they are without a toilet,  tub or shower, or running water . In the 1940s, around a third  of homes in the U.S. had no flushing toilet. In some States, up to 70 per cent of people did not have a flushing toilet in their own home, instead most people went to use an outside toilet or privy. On a state-by-state basis, around 80 per cent of homes in Mississippi were without a flushing toilet in 1940 but by the 1990s just 4 per cent were without a public sewer, septic tank, or cesspool. In 1990, only 1 percent of American homes our homes lacked complete plumbing facilities. But, things were much different in 1940, when nearly half lacked complete plumbing. Then, about ten States had rates approaching or exceeding 70 percent. In the middle of nowhere: The places that are likely to have toilets that don't flush are in rural area and very remote . In succeeding decades, the proportion of homes lacking complete plumbing dropped dramatically, falling to about one-third in 1950 and one- sixth in 1960. It is interesting to note the States with the lowest percentage of such homes in 1940 were higher than Alaska, which topped the 1990 list. So who doesn't have a flushing toilet? Counties containing Indian reservations have astonishingly high percentages of households without plumbing. Heritage: Indian reservations are also more likely not to have proper plumbing and runing water such as Tes Nez Iah, and Apache County, Arizona . 14 percent of households in Shannon County, South Dakota don't have full plumbing. In Apache County, Arizona., the rate is more than 17 percent. Sparsely-populated census areas in Alaska also have very high percentages. Counties along the Rio Grande in Texas have high rates of unplumbed households. There are also homes in eastern Kentucky and West Virginia too. In 1990, although homes that were without plumbing numbered less than 3 per cent across the entire United States, 12 per cent of properties in Arkansas were without flushing toilets. To view the results in full you can see the information gathered by the United States Census Bureau .","In the 1950s, a quarter of Americans did not have a flushing toilet .

"By . Anna Edwards . and Emma Reynolds . Sir Jimmy Savile was interviewed by police over child abuse allegations in 2007 but no charges were ever brought, it has emerged. The late TV host was questioned about an alleged indecent assault at a children's home in Staines during the 1970s, but the Crown Prosecution Service decided there was 'insufficient evidence' to proceed. This is the first time it has been revealed that Savile was ever questioned by police over sexual assault allegations. Surrey police said in a statement: 'In 2007 Surrey Police received an historic allegation of indecent assault which is alleged to have occurred at a children's home in Staines during the 1970s. The accusations made about Jimmy Savile have left many shocked, as women have come forward to allege that they were abused by the TV star . 'The allegation was investigated and an individual was interviewed under caution. 'The matter was referred to the Crown Prosecution Service for a charging decision who advised there was insufficient evidence to take any further action.' The interview is thought to have related . to alleged sexual abuse at the now-closed Duncroft Approved School for . Girls near Staines, Surrey, where Savile was a regular visitor. The revelation comes ahead of a TV documentary to be broadcast on Wednesday, which appears to show the late TV star defending child molester Gary Glitter during an interview, insisting that the disgraced pop star had 'done nothing wrong'. Women have recently gone public with accusations that Savile, who died last year aged 84, groomed girls as young as 12 by offering them sweets, cigarettes and tickets to be in the audience of his shows. Now, in the documentary Exposure: The Other Side Of Jimmy Savile, the presenter appears to come to Glitter's defence, insisting the sexual predator had only watched 'dodgy' films - referring to the child pornography that was discovered on the singer's computer. Sir Jimmy Savile is seen in an interview from 2009 appearing to defend Gary Glitter and insisting the disgraced pop star had only watched 'dodgy films' Glitter was sentenced to four months' imprisonment after being convicted of downloading over 4,000 pornographic images of children, some as young as two and three, in 1999. In March 2006 Glitter was jailed for three years for molesting two girls, aged 11 and 12, in the Vietnamese resort town of Vung Tau and made to sign the sex offenders' register. Savile allegedly says in a recorded interview that Glitter - whose real name is Paul Gadd - had only used the films for his own 'gratification' and had not tried to profit from them by selling them. The Jim'll Fix It presenter is shown in an interview with a journalist in 2009, suggesting that Gadd was more victim than predator. He says: 'Now Gary, all he did was to take his computer into PC World to get it repaired. 'They went into the hard drive, saw all these dodgy pictures and told the police and the police then, ""Oh we've got a famous person...Oh my goodness, yeah we'll have them."" 'But Gary has not sold 'em, has not tried to sell 'em, not tried to show them in public or anything like that. 'It were for his own gratification. Whether it was right or wrong is of course it's up to him as a person. Paedophile Gary Glitter was jailed for three years for his sex crimes . 'But they didn't do anything wrong but they are then demonized. 'And of course, if you ever said to that copper, what's Gary Glitter done wrong? Well nothing really. 'He's just sat at home watching these dodgy dodgy films. 'He was like that but he wasn't public with it and he didn't do anything.' The shocking interview comes in the same programme that features accusations from women who claim they were sexually abused by the former Jim’ll Fix It star in his Rolls-Royce, at a hospital, at a school and BBC Television Centre. One of the alleged victims claims the former Radio 1 DJ raped her in his dressing room, while another says that the television star also fondled a teenager's breast in a caravan. An ITV1 documentary to be aired on Wednesday night also features damning contributions from BBC production staff who claim Savile’s predatory behaviour was an open secret. One former BBC producer who saw Savile in a restaurant with a girl aged around 12 describes Top Of The Pops as his ‘happy hunting ground’. Broadcaster and ChildLine founder Esther Rantzen admits many in the television industry ‘blocked our ears’ to claims made about Savile during his 40-year career at the BBC. Writing in today’s Daily Mail, she says: ‘I felt Jim had persuaded us all, audiences, fans, television professionals, even the Pope, to create a myth around Saintly Jim so that he became untouchable. 'One of the assaults had even been witnessed by the member of a television production team. So why was nothing done?’ The BBC insists its ‘well resourced’ investigation into Savile was shelved by Newsnight editor Peter Rippon for editorial reasons. But sources at the BBC claimed it was scrapped at the ‘eleventh hour’ because executives felt ‘incredibly uncomfortable’ broadcasting allegations of Savile’s sexual misconduct. Peter Rippon has labelled such claims as ‘malicious’ and said that the piece was not broadcast because the story could not be substantiated. Esther Rantzen now believes that Sir Jimmy Savile was a sex abuser . It is also claimed the report would have clashed with a glowing Christmas Day broadcast about Savile on Radio 2. The ITV1 documentary claims some BBC producers had been aware of Savile’s behaviour as far back as the mid 1960s. The BBC last night said it found no evidence of any misconduct by the broadcaster in relation to its conduct towards Savile. In a statement it said: ‘The BBC has conducted extensive searches of its files to establish whether there is any record of misconduct or allegations of misconduct by Sir Jimmy Savile during his time at the BBC. No such evidence has been found. 'Whilst the BBC condemns any behaviour of the type alleged in the strongest terms, in the absence of evidence of any kind found at the BBC that corroborates the allegations that have been made, it is simply not possible for the corporation to take any further action.' Broadcaster Paul Gambaccini has claimed Sir Jimmy Savile used his charity fundraising work as a lever to prevent his private life being exposed. Gambaccini said his former Radio 1 colleague played tabloid newspapers 'like a Stradivarius' to keep any allegations of impropriety quiet. Gambaccini, speaking on ITV1’s Daybreak this morning, said he had been 'waiting 30 years' for such stories to come out. He said Sir Jimmy was 'about to be exposed' by one newspaper, but to prevent its publication he gave an interview to a rival tabloid which had the effect of stopping the negative piece. Gambaccini went on: 'On another occasion, and this cuts to the chase of the whole matter, he was called and he said ""well you could run that story, but if you do there goes the funds that come in to Stoke Mandeville - do you want to be responsible for the drying up of the charity donations?"" And they backed down.' Sir Jimmy had raised millions of pounds over the years for his pet cause, Stoke Mandeville Hospital.Gambaccini added: 'It comes out when he’s dead because Jimmy Savile had an imperial personality in show business, I’m not talking about personal life. You just didn't mess with Jim. 'He was the governor, because after all he had been the first great club DJ, he had been the originator of Top Of The Pops presentation, and you just let him have his turf. 'And none of us were interested in going there because he was away from us. At social occasions we would all be together, but Jim would not be and he had his own life.' Members of the Jim’ll Fix It star’s family and friends have expressed their disgust that the allegations are being made when the presenter, who died on October 29 last year aged 84, is no longer around to defend himself. Roger Foster, Sir Jimmy’s nephew, said his family was 'disgusted and disappointed' by the programme. Mr Foster, from Goole, East Yorkshire, said he was not only concerned for Sir Jimmy’s reputation, but also for the damage the allegations could do to his charities. 'The guy hasn’t been dead for a year yet and they’re bringing these stories out. It could affect his legacy, his charity work, everything. I’m very sad and disgusted,' he said. 'I just don’t understand the motives behind this. I just think it’s very, very sad you can say these things after someone’s died and the law says you can’t defend yourself when you’re dead.' A spokesman for ITV defended its programme, saying: 'This documentary is the result of an in-depth investigation into long-standing allegations of serious and widespread sexual misconduct by Sir Jimmy Savile. Because of the very serious nature of the claims made by several interviewees in relation to this, particular care and consideration was of course given to the decision to produce and broadcast this programme. 'The programme takes full account of the fact that Sir Jimmy is not here to defend himself against these claims.'

"By . Jason Groves . Claim: Jose Manuel Barroso claims that David Cameron's plans to renegotiate power from the EU is doomed . David Cameron’s plan to claw back powers from Brussels is ‘doomed to failure’, the president of the European Commission has claimed. In a provocative intervention Jose Manuel Barroso rubbished Mr Cameron’s plan to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with Europe, saying it was ‘unreasonable’ to expect other member states to agree to fundamental changes. The Prime Minister has staked his reputation on securing a new deal on Europe ahead of an in/out referendum in 2017. Speaking at the Conservative Party conference this week he insisted that other countries were willing to consider Britain’s requests, including his demand that the historic EU aim of ‘ever-closer union’ is scrapped. He said: ‘We’ve won allies to get powers back from Europe. That is what we will do. And at the end of it - yes - we will give the British people their say in a referendum. 'That is our pledge. It will be your choice - in or out.’ But, in a series of interviews in Brussels, Mr Barroso said the EU would never agree to fundamental change. He said minor measures and red tape, such as a proposed ban on hairdressers wearing high heels, could be scrapped on a case-by-case basis. Mr Barroso said there was no prospect of wholesale changes to the so-called ‘acquis’ - the 150,000 book of EU regulations. He added: ‘There are two ways (of achieving change). One is the pragmatic, reasonable approach, seeing case by case whether legislation is needed or not. ‘The other one is to have a fundamental discussion about the competences (powers) of the EU, even in terms of renationalisation. I think the second approach is doomed to failure.’ Fighting a losing battle: The Prime Minister has staked his reputation on securing a new deal on Europe . Mr Barroso said there would be ‘others, many, who oppose’ Mr Cameron’s call for treaty change - and suggested British proposals would be vetoed. ‘Britain wants to again consider the option of opting out,’ he said. ‘Fine, let’s discuss it, but to put into question the whole acquis of Europe is not very reasonable.’ Doomed: Ukip leader Nigel Farage said that Mr Barroso is right in his warning to David Cameron . Tory MP Anne Main warned that Mr Barroso’s intervention would harden Eurosceptic views in Britain. She said: ‘The view of parliament and, I think, the country is that if we can’t get a significant renegotiation then we may want to re-evaluate our membership of the EU. ‘Comments like this push us further down that road. If they won’t renegotiate and see the writing on the wall then they will leave us very few options. ‘As far as Mr Barroso is concerned I think the views of elected representatives should carry a great deal more weight than those of an unaccountable official.’ UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage said Mr Barroso was right to warn that any attempt at fundamental renegotiation was doomed. But the think tank Open Europe described Mr Barroso’s intervention as ‘sort of irrelevant’ - pointing out that his term of office expires next year, and that the negotiations will be carried out mainly by national leaders rather than the European Commission.","Jose Manuel Barroso rubbished Prime Minister's renegotiation plans .

"By . Rob Waugh . Updated: . 10:04 EST, 16 December 2011 . Sales of handsets such as BlackBerry touch slow to 11 million per quarter: Analysts say that the company RIM 'needs to get new handsets out' - but CEO Mike Lazaridis admitted that the new 'BB10' handsets now face delays until late 2012 . New, touchscreen BlackBerries designed to update the smartphone brand for consumers used to iPhones and other touch handsets such as Android have been delayed until the end of next year. It's a delay that some analysts predict could be disastrous for the company. The touchscreen BB10 phones were crucial to updating the brand. The co-CEOs insisted that BlackBerry can hold out - but admitted that BlackBerry sales were falling month by month, and that net income had fallen 71 per cent. Earlier this year, BlackBerry also ran into trademark difficulties for the new operating system - BBX - and renamed the phones BB10 to avoid a dispute. No official name or spec for any of the handsets has yet been revealed. Shots of an angular handset supposedly known as BlackBerry London leaked earlier this month. The phones will run an operating system that's mid-way between the simple, old-style operating system of current BlackBerries, and the more iPad-esque OS of the recent BlackBerry PlayBook. PlayBook was another disaster for the company, with the seven-inch tablet sold at a damaging loss after customers failed to take an interest. PlayBook required a BlackBerry phone 'tethered' to it for email to work - unlike any other tablet on the market. Peter Misek, an analyst at Jefferies . & Co in New York, said the . company needs to get its new phones out fast. Mike Lazaridis, one of the company's co-CEOs, said the BlackBerry 10 phones will need a new chipset that will not be available until mid-2012, so the company expects the new phones to ship late in the year.'We've experienced a delay,' he said. Analysts say RIM's future depends on the new software. Research Motion in motion co-CEO Mike Lazaridis - pictured, with co-CEO , Jim Balsillie - said that the advanced chips required by BlackBerry's BB10 handsets meant there would be 'a delay' RIM said BlackBerry sales will fall sharply in the holiday quarter, providing further evidence that it is struggling to compete with the iPhone and smartphones running Android. It has also been having a hard time finding a niche in the tablet computer market, which is dominated by Apple's iPad. RIM said its net income sank 71% as revenue fell and the company took a large accounting charge because it had to sell its PlayBook tablet computer at a deep discount. The Canadian company said revenue fell 6% to 5.2 billion dollars.The company shipped 14.1 million BlackBerry smartphones during the third quarter and 150,000 PlayBook tablet. RIM said it would only ship between 11 million and 12 million BlackBerrys in the fourth quarter and said earnings would be in the range of 80 to 95 cents per share. Otherwise, RIM could lose money in future quarters as it continues to struggle to sell the current, stopgap models. Jim Balsillie, the other co-CEO, acknowledged the challenges facing the once-iconic company and said executives are working to turn it around. 'It may take some time to realise the benefits of these efforts and the platform transition that we are undertaking, but we continue to believe that RIM has the right set of strengths and capabilities to maintain a leading role in the mobile communications industry,' he said. RIM's stock fell 1.20 dollars to 13.93 dollars in extended trading after the results were released.","Net income falls 71 per cent .

"One million worshippers from all over the world have gathered in Rome ahead of the ‘unprecedented’ double canonisation of two former popes. Over the last 24 hours, crowds have arrived and camped out in Vatican City ahead of the canonisation of Popes John Paul II and John XXIII at St Peter’s Square. The ceremony, to be held later today, will be an unprecedented event in Catholic history, as two living Popes will be in attendance – the current Pope Francis I and Benedict XVI, who stood down last year and now holds the title Pope Emeritus.

The ceremony, to be held later today, will be an unprecedented event in Catholic history, as two living Popes will be in attendance - the current Pope Francis I and Benedict XVI, who stood down last year and now holds the title Pope Emeritus . Around one million people have set up camp in Vatican City as they prepare to watch the double canonisation of Popes John Paul II and John XXIII at St Peter¿s Square later today . The ceremony, to be held later today, will be an unprecedented event in Catholic history, as two living Popes will be in attendance - the current Pope Francis I and Benedict XVI, who stood down last year and now holds the title Pope Emeritus . Worshippers attended a prayer vigil at the Chiesa Degli Artisti last night where Pope John XXIII celebrated his first mass in Vatican City . Former pontiff John Paul II is due to be canonised alongside John XXIII, who was Pope from 1958-1963, in a ceremony which is expected to be watched by millions of people around the world. For the past year Benedict has largely dedicated himself to prayer in a monastery in the Vatican grounds. It means today’s ceremony will be his highest-profile appearance since he retired. Francis, who lives in a guesthouse elsewhere in Vatican City, has been quite welcoming to his predecessor, occasionally paying a call on Benedict. It was Francis who sought to include Benedict in the ceremony, which is expected to draw crowds of more than one million tourists and pilgrims. Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi explained Benedict's involvement, saying he will be in St. Peter's Square for the canonisation of John and John Paul, where he will 'concelebrate' the Mass with Francis and other cardinals. 'Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI has accepted the invitation, and has let Pope Francis know that he will be present tomorrow morning at the canonization ceremony and will concelebrate' along with other prelates, Lombardi said. 'That doesn't mean that he will go up on the altar' on the steps of St. Peter's Basilica, Lombardi said of the outdoor Mass.

Preparations were well underway on Saturday for the canonisation of John Paul II and John XXIII in what will be an unprecedented event in Catholic history . Hundreds of thousands of people descended on Vatican City on Saturday to ensure they had a prime position for the canonisation which will take place in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican later today . Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi said Benedict - Pope Francis's predecessor - will be in St. Peter's Square for the canonisation of John and John Paul . Priests sing and dance in St Peter's Square as they gear up for the historical ceremony, which will see Pope Francis elevate John XXIII and John Paul II to sainthood . He noted that during the ceremony, cardinals and bishops will be seated on one side of the esplanade, with, presumably, Benedict, among them. 'We will all be happy to have his presence' at the ceremony, the Vatican spokesman said. Benedict also attended Francis' ceremony to elevate churchmen to cardinal's rank in February. But that ceremony wasn't a Mass, meaning Sunday's appearance by two popes would be the first Mass concelebrated by two pontiffs, one reigning and the other retired. As German Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, Benedict presided over John Paul II's funeral in the square in 2005. He was soon elected pontiff himself, going on to lead the ceremony to beatify his Polish-born predecessor in 2011, also in the square. It was John Paul who, early in his papacy, appointed the German prelate to a key Vatican post in charge of safeguarding church teaching, and eventually, also dealing with the mounting cases of sexual abuse of minors by priests in the United States and elsewhere. Benedict has a connection to John XXII's papacy as well. As a young theologian, he attended the Second Vatican Council, the gathering of prelates from around the globe that the Italian pope set up as a way to bring modernizing reforms to the Catholic church.

On Saturday, pilgrims were pouring into Rome in big groups or as individual families or travellers, eager to be among those taking their place in the square before dawn on the day of the ceremony. Interior Minister Angelino Alfano said an estimated one million people were expected to flood into Rome for the event. Working to ensure the crowds are safe, authorities were deploying about 3,500 extra police officers in Rome, beefing up the total to around 10,000 officers. Police were also trying to keep faithful from being ripped off. Italy's customs and tax police cracked down on vendors selling counterfeit merchandise, confiscating 1,500 boxes of rosaries resembling the ones that Pope Francis had distributed free to faithful in St. Peter's Square in November. The boxes resemble packets of pills, in line with Francis' description of the rosary prayer as 'spiritual medicine'. The tax police also handed out fines to 23 establishments that were billing themselves as bed-and-breakfast lodgings for pilgrims, even though they lacked the proper authorization to rent out rooms.

Abuse victims of Catholic priests have said that former Pope John Paul II does not deserve to be made a saint because of his failure to bring perpetrators to justice during his reign. John Paul, who was head of the Catholic church from 1978 until his death in 2005, 'enabled wrongdoing' and was more interested in protecting the Church's reputation than helping victims, according to campaigners. Barbara Blaine, the president of the Survivors' Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), spoke out against John Paul today. Mrs Blaine told the Daily Telegraph: 'It’s time for the Vatican to stop honouring those who enabled wrongdoing.

He could have used his enormous power to save children but instead he decided to save the reputation of the Church.' The organisation also published an open letter on their website to other abuse victims. It said: 'At best, [John Paul] turned a blind eye to clergy sexual crimes and cover-ups. At worst, he perpetuated and approved them. 'For him to now be given the highest honor in the church rubs even more salt into the already deep and still fresh wounds of thousands of struggling victims and millions of betrayed Catholics and victims. 'For all of you who are upset because of this callous sainthood decision and celebration, we want you to know that you are not alone.'","Canonisation of former Popes John Paul II and John XXIII will take place in St Peter's Square, Vatican City .

A hunt for a serial killer is underway after the skeletal remains of four people including a skull with ‘Death to paedophiles’ written across it were found off the French coast. The bones were found by a diver in February in the shallow waters off the Cotes d'Azur and have been identified as belonging to two women and two men. French detectives have opened a murder investigation and are now investigating how the victims died and whether they were kidnapped. Georges Gutierrez, the prosecutor in .

Detectives said there had never been any suggestion that Mr Hirson was involved in pedophilia, either as a victim or as a perpetrator. Scientists have struggled to obtain genetic material from the bones, but the skull, thought to belong to a 50-year old man, was the first remain to be found and the words ‘Death to paedophiles’  had been written in permanent marker across it, still clearly visible despite the skull's lengthy underwater. Expert divers combed the area and brought up another three bones – including the humerus of Hirson. A jawbone was found stuck between rocks during a second dive. 'Why was just one bone per individual and not more parts of the skeleton?,' asked Mr Gutierrez.

A fraudster who received £90,000 in benefits by claiming he could not walk more than 60 metres was exposed when hidden cameras filmed him carrying heavy furniture while running a successful house-clearance business. William Anthony, 59, from Chingford, North London, said he suffered a string of debilitating illnesses including heart problems and arthritis which left him virtually immobile. But his lies were revealed when a TV crew uncovering Britain’s biggest benefits cheats filled a house with furniture and called his firm to have it cleared. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Uncovered: William Anthony, who claimed to be virtually immobile, was caught out when hidden cameras filmed him operating a busy furniture-clearing business in London . Hidden cameras filmed Anthony helping move three tonnes of items, including huge book cases and shelves, from the property in Croydon, South London, in just six hours. At the same time Anthony was being investigated by Kensington and Chelsea Borough Council in London who had uncovered his double life. He had come to the local authority’s attention when he submitted fraudulent paperwork in a bid take over ownership of his late mother’s home in the up-market Kensington. The council also found he used a second identity - William Stanley - which he created using a false passport and helped him run his large-scale scam. Cheat: TV crew exposing Britain's biggest cheats filled a house with furniture and asked Anthony's firm to empty it . Speed: The workmen managed to completely clear the house in just six hours . Anthony told the council he was unable to work because he had hypertension, arthritis in his hips and hands, panic attacks, high cholesterol, partial deafness and speech problems. He also claimed he was homeless and got the council to put him up in a hotel at the taxpayers’ expense while he still owned a house. In three years he pocketed £87,037 in income support, disability living allowance and housing benefits while he was running the London-based clearance business. Caught: The fraudster also went by the name William Stanley and said he could not walk more than 60 metres .

"By . Arthur Martin . and Chris Greenwood . The largest police force in Britain could recruit an officer from an ethnic minority for every white officer it hires. Scotland Yard has held talks with the Government about changing the law to boost the number of ethnic minority applicants. The force said it wants to break the mould of a 'white, male-dominated' force to match the growth of London's ethnic population. Scotland Yard has held talks with the Government about changing the law to boost the number of ethnic minority applicants . Senior officers are interested in replicating a radical Northern Ireland system which saw one Catholic officer recruited for every Protestant officer. Assistant commissioner Simon Byrne said the Met's idea would mean they 'could only recruit, in very broad terms, a white officer if you can recruit a black or minority ethnic person at the same time'.Mr Byrne, who is in charge of territorial policing, said the current law 'doesn't allow us to be as bold as we could be'. Positive discrimination, where a lesser qualified candidate is awarded a job just because he or she is from a minority, is currently illegal in mainland UK. The Met sparked outrage two years ago when it banned white middle-class students from applying for internships. Critics were quick to brand the 12-week Diversity Internship - which gives students a head start in the battle for police jobs - as degrading. Last night John Tully, who heads the Metropolitan Police Federation which represents rank and file officers, said he was opposed to the latest plans. 'Our position is that we do not support positive discrimination,' he said. 'Selection for all jobs should be purely on merit.' At the moment nine out of 10 Met officers are white, while the latest census data shows London's ethnic population is around 40per cent. Some police chiefs fear overly white forces, especially in urban areas, risk damaging the legitimacy of policing as they exercise the power of the state over increasingly ethnically diverse populations. In an interview with The Guardian, Mr Byrne said: 'We have not kept pace with the changing shape of London... The thing we have got to overcome, by legacy and history, we have broadly been, initially, a white, male-dominated organisation.' Mr Byrne said the danger was that the force would end up missing the chance to change the ethnic make-up of recruits and 'get swamped by applications from our relatives'. The force said it wants to break the mould of a 'white, male-dominated' force to match the growth of London's ethnic population . He admitted the '50-50' proposals amounted to 'positive discrimination' which would require a change in the law. His comments came as the Met is about to embark on a huge public recruitment campaign for 5,000 officers over the next four years. Senior officers fear the mainly white face of policing risks damaging relations with minority communities and also makes the police less effective in fighting terrorism. In a separate interview Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'The police service is not as effective as it could be in countering terrorism because of its ethnic make-up.'A big part of dealing with terrorism and crime is gathering intelligence, having people who get to know local people.' Sir Peter said he now wanted to push the law to the limit to stipulate that recruits would be more likely to be chosen if they had knowledge of a language or of an ethnic community. Two months ago the National Black Police Association said the Met was still 'institutionally racist' - some 14 years after an official inquiry into the Stephen Lawrence murder came to the same conclusion. Critics of the police say that as well as the ranks being too white, police discrimination leads to minority ethnic people being more likely to be subjected to stop and search than whites, which damages confidence and trust in the police.","Scotland Yard wants to break mould of a 'white, male-dominated' force .

"By . Emma Innes . Insulin injections for diabetics could soon be a thing of the past thanks to the creation of a revolutionary new implant. The device, which has been created by British scientists, works like an artificial pancreas by releasing insulin into the bloodstream. It can be implanted into the abdomen from where it releases a precise amount of insulin meaning injections are no longer needed. A new abdominal implant could spell the end of insulin injections for people with diabetes . The supplies of insulin in the implant can be topped up every two weeks using a tube which passes out through the skin. The wristwatch-size device was created by scientists at De Montfort University, in Leicester. They say it is the next best thing to a cure for diabetes because it means the patient no longer has to manage the condition themselves. Professor Joan Taylor, professor of pharmacy at De Montfort University in Leicester, said: ‘The device will not only remove the need to manually inject insulin, but will also ensure that perfect doses are administrated each and every time. ‘By controlling blood glucose so effectively, we should be able to help reduce related health problems. ‘We are extremely close to embarking on clinical trials. Diabetes is costing society more than £1 million an hour in treatment, and much of that is spent on treating complications.’ Human trials of the device are due to . begin in 2016 and the researchers hope the first implants will take . place on the NHS within a decade. The implant, which has to be inserted surgically, contains a reservoir of insulin that is kept in place by a gel barrier. The implant was invented by Professor Joan Taylor (left) who says it is as good as a cure for diabetes as it means patients no longer need to monitor and control their condition themselves . The researchers hope their device could save millions of people from daily insulin injections (pictured) and that it could help to prevent the health problems associated with poor diabetes management . When glucose levels in the body rise, the gel liquefies and releases insulin into the body, mimicking the normal behaviour of a pancreas. As the insulin lowers the glucose levels, the gel reacts by hardening again and preserving the reservoir. It would eliminate the need for diabetics to inject insulin up to four times a day. The artificial pancreas could help all type 1 insulin-dependent diabetics and some type 2 diabetics who need daily injections. ‘This device is cheap and simple to use,’ said Professor Taylor. ‘It has the potential to bring an end to the misery of daily injections for diabetics.’","The wristwatch-size device can be surgically implanted into the abdomen .

"By . Wills Robinson . A paedophile teacher who abused children at a leading private school was allowed to hug his children goodbye after his vile acts were exposed. William Vahey, who allegedly targeted around 60 boys, has also been labelled one of the most prolific sex offenders of all time by the FBI. While working at schools around the world, the 64-year-old was said to have held a . ‘cookie race’ at bedtime in which children as young as ten were . encouraged to eat as many as they could, unaware they had been drugged.

After the teacher embraced the pupils, he was then driven to the airport in a school van, according to The Sun. The revelations did not come as a surprise to a former pupil known as Jonathan, who said there was something 'not right' about Vahey frrom the start. He told The Guardian: 'I had my suspicions from the beginning. There was something a bit off about him. 'Other people would say he was their favourite teacher but I would say there was something not right.' The schoolboy said Vahey promoted a 'travel club' where he tried to organise trips abroad. Boys would stay in hotel rooms in groups of three or four and Vahey would 'tickle' them before they went to sleep. The extent of his crimes around the world were revealed in an FBI affidavit. The American agency is leading the investigation into the historic abuse claims. Special Agent Shauna Dunlap told Sky News: 'Without a doubt, this is certainly one of the most prolific suspected sexual predators that we've seen, given the numbers of children, potential victims, his position of trust, and so forth. 'And some of the allegations and the methods that are being alleged that he may have employed while committing these crimes.' It has been claimed Vahey would sprinkle crushed sedatives into Oreo cookies and feed them to his pupils . Ms Dunlap added the FBI would not 'stop seeking justice' because Vahey is dead. The . revelations prompted 'complete shock' in Natalie Salmon, 23, who was at a . school where the paedophile teacher worked in Venezuela. She said: 'It’s so sad, and it’s the first time where I’ve thought to myself as a girl I am safer than being a boy.’ Miss . Salmon said she remembered Vahey as being a 'nice, shy sort of guy', . but that her male friends from school now refuse to even speak about the . possibility they were his victims. FBI . investigators said more than 100 potential victims had come forward . since news broke yesterday that the married American had taken pictures . of himself attacking up to 60 sleeping students from the elite Southbank . International School in Westminster during class trips abroad between . 2009 and 2013. The . sickening images depicted children aged ten to 14 at the international . school, where he taught history and geography and led trips to Jordan, . Nepal and Venezuela. Another . 30 children, who also appeared to be unconscious or asleep when the . assaults took place, were pictured from other schools he worked in . during a 40-year career spent teaching at ten American international . schools in nine countries. Southbank . International School, which is favoured by diplomats and foreign . executives, has 758 pupils and charges fees of £25,000 a year. Vahey . committed suicide at a motel in the US last month as the FBI were . poised to investigate a USB memory stick containing the graphic images . of naked children dating back to 2008. The . father of two plunged a knife into his chest two days after confessing . that he had abused boys throughout his life using sleeping pills. Victims of paedophile William Vahey, pictured, allegedly committed suicide after being molested by the teacher at a school in Saudi Arabia, it has been claimed by a former student . Police . later removed items from his £1.8million apartment in Maida Vale, west . London, where he is alleged to have kept large amounts of sleeping . pills. Miss . Salmon, now a broadcast journalism student in London, was 11 when she . enrolled at the elite English-language international school Escuela . Campo Alegre in Caracas where her father was working for oil giant . Halliburton. She told Sky News the revelations about the popular American history and geography teacher had come as a ‘complete shock’. A . former student taught by Vahey at the Jakarta International School in . Indonesia in the 1990s, who did not want to be named, told the Mail she . could not reconcile the ‘great teacher’ with the predatory monster now . revealed. Yesterday . a British mother of two, whose teenage sons went on several school . trips with Vahey, said he used to hand out Oreo cookies and tell pupils . that they could be the lead character in his bedtime story if they won . the cookie race. ‘Then the first one who had the Oreo, the higher up they would be in the story and so on. He would have been able to split the Oreos apart, ground up the stuff and sprinkle it in the middle.’ The mother was once a friend of Vahey and his wife Jean, 66, who is the executive director of the European Council of International Schools. An FBI affidavit obtained by the Daily Mail showed how he catalogued the abuse by time and location in folders on a USB memory stick entitled ‘Panama trip’, ‘Costa Rica trip’ and ‘Basketball trip’ and ‘Spring 2013’. The document says: ‘These images depict minor males in various states of undress... The minor males appear to be asleep, unconscious or possibly drugged.’ Vahey, who left Southbank International last year, was only caught after a housekeeper at a school he moved to in Nicaragua stole a memory stick containing the vile images. She was sacked but later passed the USB stick to administrators at the American School in Managua, who dismissed Vahey after recognising his hand in the images. Vahey taught at the elite £25,000-a-year Southbank International School in Westminster, London, pictured, right up until last year . In 1970, while studying for a teaching degree, Vahey was jailed for 90 days after pleading guilty to molesting boys at a swimming pool where he was working as an instructor in California. He was required to register as a sex offender for life, but after graduating from college in 1972 failed to sign the register. In 2010 an inspection report had warned of a weakness in staff vetting measures at Southbank International, but Sir Chris Woodhead, chairman of the governors said yesterday that it was ‘irrelevant’ in Vahey’s case as he was not on the sex offender’s register. Sir Chris said there had never been a complaint against Vahey, although there was one incident where a boy was ill on a trip and Vahey took the boy into his room to look after him. A school investigation subsequently found ‘nothing untoward’.","William Vahey, 64, allegedly abused up to 60 boys at leading private school .

"By . Amanda Williams . Research, commissioned by death row prisoner Duane Buck's defence team, has shown black prisoners in Houston are more likely to face death sentence . Black defendants facing trial in Houston are three times more likely to face a death sentence than whites, a new study has claimed. A study by a criminologist at the University of Maryland said since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1977 there have been 116 executions in Harris County, which incorporates Houston, the largest city in Texas. It is more than any entire state in the area apart from Texas itself. Professor Raymond Paternoster carried out the research after being commissioned by death row prisoner Duane Buck's defence team. Buck was sentenced to death for the fatal shootings of his ex-girlfriend and a man in her apartment in July 1995. His death sentence is currently being reconsidered by the Texas courts, The Guardian reports. Professor Paternoster looked at 504 cases of adult defendants accused of capital murder in Harris County between 1992 and 1999. It was during this period that Buck was charged for murdering his former girlfriend, Debra Gardner, and a man called Kenneth Butler. Of that number he then broke it down to 21 cases - including that of Buck's - which were most similar in circumstances. He found that seven out of the ten men sent for capital trial were black African American. This compares with just one of the five white defendant. In his report he writes: 'The probability that the district attorney will advance a case to a [death] penalty trial is more than three times as high when the defendant is African American than for white defendants.' In Texas the jury decides whether those convicted will face execution. Of those facing trial Harris County juries sent four of the seven black defendants to execution and also the white defendant. He said this slightly redressed the balance as  100 per cent of the  white capital defendants in the sample were given death penalty compared with 57 per cent of the African American sample. But of the original group of 21 cases, the black defendants were more than twice as likely to be sentenced to death than their white counterparts, he said. The report - filed on Wednesday - is part of petition by Buck's defence team. Since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1977 there have been 116 executions in Harris County, which incorporates Houston, the largest city in Texas . Buck, 50, was spared from lethal injection in 2011 when the justices said they would review an appeal in his case because it had been 'racially influenced'. Two appeals, both related to a psychologist's testimony that black people were more likely to commit violence, were before the court. One was granted; the other was denied. Christina Swarns of the NAACP legal . defense fund, told the paper there was a pattern of racial discrimination in the death row punishment in Texas. She said: 'Over generations there has never been a time in Texas when the death . penalty did not yield evidence of racial discrimination.' Buck was convicted of gunning down ex-girlfriend Debra Gardner, 32, and Kenneth Butler, 33, outside Houston on July, 30, 1995, a week after Buck and Gardner broke up. A study by a criminologist at the University of Maryland looked at 504 cases of adult defendants accused of capital murder in Harris County between 1992 and 1999 . A third person, Buck's stepsister, Phyllis Taylor, also was wounded, though she has since forgiven Buck and sought for his death sentence to be commuted to life in prison. Texas has the country's most active death row, executing more than four times as many people as any other state since the death penalty was reinstated in the United States in 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. The Harris County district court is now considering whether or not to grant Buck a new sentencing hearing.","Study by Raymond Paternoster a criminologist at the University of Maryland .

"By . Snejana Farberov . The FBI has launched an investigation to determine if an animal rights group behind Bill de Blasio’s controversial pledge to ban carriage horses in Central Park had tried to extort his opponent Christine Quinn. Sources familiar with the federal probe told the New York Daily News that agents have been questioning people about the pledge made in March 2013. The ongoing investigation also reportedly revolves around a $175,000 donation made by a union linked to Mayor de Blasio's cousin John Wilhelm to the animal rights group NYCLASS, which has  championed the ban on carriage horses. The FBI has launched an investigation to determine if an animal rights group behind Bill de Blasio¿s controversial pledge to ban carriage horses tried to extort his opponent Christine Quinn . Denial: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, left, pictured with Gov. Andrew Cuomo during the NY Rising Spring Conference on Wednesday, said that he was unaware of the FBI probe . The organization was allegedly behind the 'Anybody But Quinn' publicity campaign attacking the one-time Democratic frontrunner Quinn. According to the Daily News, federal officials are also looking into allegations that political consultant Scott Levenson affiliated with NYCLASS had threatened to derail Quinn's mayoral campaign if she didn't get on board with the carriage ban. When Ms Quinn refused to support the initiative, NYCLASS contributed a total of $400,000 to the political action committee New York is Not for Sale, which was behind Scott Levenson's Anybody But Quinn media blitz consisting of attack ads and robocalls smearing the former City Council speaker. According to records obtained by the Daily News, in June 2013, two of de Blasio's biggest donors, including his cousin John Wilhelm, contributed a total of $225,000 to NYCLASS. Mayor de Blasio's cousin, labor leader John Wilhelm (left), contributed $175,000 to the animal rights group NYCLASS, which has championed the ban on carriage horses and was also behind a smear campaign targeting mayoral candidate Christine Quinn (right) De Blasio has denied that either he or his aides conspired with NYCLASS or New York Is Not For Sale to undermine his opponent’s mayoral campaign . Campaign finance laws strictly prohibit political candidates from coordinating with PACs. Support: Actor Liam Neeson has said carriage horses should stay in the city . On Friday, Mayor de Blasio said that . he was unaware of the FBI investigation into the campaign pledge and . said that no one in his circle had been questioned. ‘Literally, I’ve told you all I know. I’m not familiar with the allegations so I can’t comment,’ de Blasio told reporters. While De Blasio wasn't passionate about the cause when he was a member of City Council in 2007, he became the face of a horse-free park in 2011 when he said it was time to pursue 'more humane alternatives to the horse-drawn carriages'. That statement seems to have helped the mayor when he was running for office last year, and anti-carriage groups funded a serious smear campaign against Quinn - his main Democrat rival. Actor Liam Neeson, who starred in Shindler's List and Taken, has become one of the horse-drawn carriage industry's main supporters after recently touring a stables where they are housed. 'It has been my experience, always, that horses, much like humans, are at their happiest and healthiest when working,' Neeson wrote in an April 14 editorial in The New York Times. Neeson believes the horse-carriage business is 'humane' and 'well regulated'. Gathering: Protesters waited outside Neeson's Manhattan home on Saturday after the actor said he did not back the proposed ban . Horseless carriage: The electric car, designed to look like a classic motor, is being offered as an alternative to horses in Central Park . While four . horses have been killed in collisions with motor vechiles, Neeson said . that is a remarkably safe record for New York's traffic.

"By . Daniel Miller . Bitcoin surged to $900 following a Senate hearing to discuss the implications of the growing popularity of virtual currencies. Congress was told that while virtual currencies may give consumers a cheap, efficient and convenient way to move money, those same attributes make them appealing to criminals. Mythili Raman, acting assistant attorney general, for the Justice Department's Criminal Division said: 'We have seen increasing use of such currencies by drug dealers, traffickers of child pornography, and perpetrators of large-scale fraud schemes.' Digital cash: Bitcoin surged to $900 ahead of a senate hearing to discuss the implications of virtual currencies . The currencies offer criminals both anonymity and the ability to process transactions that cannot be reversed, which can 'significantly complicate' the government's ability to follow money trails in related criminal investigations, she told the Senate Homeland Security Committee. Further complicating efforts, many digital currency services do not have controls to protect against abuse, Raman said. 'Many are still struggling with implementing appropriate anti-money laundering, know-your-customer and customer due diligence programs,' she said in prepared remarks. Raman appeared alongside top officials from the Secret Service and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network before the Senate Homeland Security Committee to answer questions about the growing use of digital currencies such as Bitcoin, and whether the government is doing enough to police the market. 'Virtual currencies, perhaps most notably Bitcoin, have captured the imagination of some, struck fear among others, and confused the heck out of the rest of us,' Senator Thomas Carper, who chairs the committee, said in his opening remarks at the standing-room only hearing. Warning: Mythili Raman, acting assistant attorney general, for the Justice Department's Criminal Division said virtual currencies were increasingly being used by criminals . Virtual currencies or digital cash have increasingly become a popular new way to purchase goods or services. They are not regulated or issued by a central bank. They have been touted by some as an alternative currency in countries facing financial instability. The most popular virtual currency is Bitcoin, which exists through an open-source software program and whose supply is controlled by a computer algorithm. But critics have raised concerns about a lack of regulatory oversight over virtual currencies and the fact that some of them can be transferred anonymously, raising fears that they could be used by scam artists. The general counsel of the Bitcoin Foundation, Patrick Murck, told lawmakers that digital currencies offer many benefits and are not only a cloak for illegal business. But he added that law enforcement would have to develop new methods to investigate some criminal activity. Over the past year, U.S. authorities have taken action against several players in the digital currency space. In May, U.S. authorities seized two accounts linked to the Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox, the major operator for the Bitcoin digital marketplace, after it failed to register with FinCEN. Around the same time, U.S. criminal authorities also indicted the operators of the digital currency exchange Liberty Reserve and accused the company of helping criminals launder more than $6 billion in funds linked to everything from child pornography to software used for bank hacking. In October, federal authorities shut down an online marketplace called Silk Road that was used for purchasing drugs and hiring hit men. Earlier this month a new version of the website opened for business again, raising concerns over whether authorities were fighting a loosing battle. Raman rejected such concerns and said the government was sending a message to criminals by taking down these organizations. 'We have kept pace,' she said.",Congress hears how 'digital cash' is increasingly being used by criminals .
"By . Ap . A Florida man won a precedent-setting victory last year when the U.S. Supreme Court agreed with him that his floating home was a house, not a vessel covered by maritime law. But so far the ruling hasn't helped him secure compensation for the home, which a city seized and destroyed using the laws that govern ships at sea. A judge refused in March to give homeowner Fane Lozman a single penny of the $25,000 bond posted by the city of Riviera Beach to pay for Lozman's home in case he won. Now Lozman is seeking compensation through a separate civil rights lawsuit he filed in 2008 before another judge. The lawsuit claims that Riviera Beach city officials conspired to harass him and stifle his free speech rights - and eventually try to evict him from a city marina and destroy his home - because he vocally opposed a major private marina project pushed by the city. Activist: Fane Lozman said the city seized his floating house in retaliation of him fighting against a land deal that would have given 2,200 private homes to a private developer . A hearing is scheduled for late May on the lawsuit, and Lozman has vowed not to let the matter drop. The lanky 52-year-old who served in the Marines and made millions as a financial trader in Chicago considers it his mission to fight what he considers government corruption and waste, documenting his efforts on his personal website. The Supreme Court's 2013 ruling on his floating home was seen by legal experts as an important precedent in maritime law for thousands of other people who make their homes on the water as well as businesses such as floating casinos. Different laws apply to vessels and homes, with homeowners receiving some protection from seizure under state laws in Florida and elsewhere. Lozman's 57-foot floating home was first unsuccessfully targeted by Riviera Beach for eviction from its marina. Then, the city declared in 2009 it was a vessel and that Lozman had to leave unless he could get it registered as such. Eventually that dispute wound up in federal court, leading to the Supreme Court ruling. When it came time to settle the $25,000 bond issue, Riviera Beach officials noted that the home sold for only $4,100 before it was destroyed. The winning bidder was the city itself. Still, the officials said in court papers that Lozman had ample opportunity to prevent its destruction, including bidding on it himself at an auction. 'He should not be rewarded for a total loss that was completely avoidable,' said Jules Massee, one of the city's attorneys, in a court document. Dangerous: While trying to get Lozman evicted from the marina, the city argued that his 10-pound dachshund, Lady, was dangerous . Fort Lauderdale-based U.S. District Judge William Dimitrouleas - who'd previously sided with the city before the high court overturned the ruling decision - refused in March to give the bond money to Lozman. 'This judge doesn't decide the law of the land. The Supreme Court does,' Lozman said in an interview. 'It's a slap in the face of the Supreme Court.' The battle now is joined before a different federal judge on Lozman's civil rights lawsuit, in which he claims the Riviera Beach City Council decided in a closed 2006 meeting to start a 'campaign of harassment and retaliation' against him over the marina project dispute. That included, he says, his improper arrest while speaking at an open city council meeting, after which he was led out in handcuffs. Lozman was charged with disorderly conduct, trespassing and resisting arrest without violence, but Palm Beach County prosecutors ultimately dropped the case. Lozman seeks unspecified damages in the civil rights case, including compensation for his floating home. He also says he incurred $250,000 in legal fees and costs in the long appellate fight. The city contends he should again get nothing. Its lawyers say there's no evidence the city ever had a formal policy to harass or intimidate him and that it was Dimitrouleas who approved the floating home's sale and destruction. Precedent: Lozman's case set new precedent for centuries-old maritime law that reach far beyond his floating house . 'A municipality should not be held liable for actions over which it was no control,' the Riviera Beach attorneys said in court papers. A hearing is set for May 19 that will determine whether the case ends or proceeds to trial, which would take place in October. Lozman is now living with his dog and cat on a larger, two-story floating home near Miami, but is determined to see through the case related to his previous dwelling. 'A jury is going to need to determine the value of my floating home,' he said.","Fane Lozman fought the city of Riviera Beach's plan to turn 2,200 private homes over to a private developer .

"By . Ryan Gorman . A violent three hour standoff came to a dramatic conclusion Friday when officers gunned him down as he ran outside shooting at police. Emmanuel Wooten, 20, holed up inside the Meridian, Mississippi, home after fleeing police two days earlier while they tried to apprehend him for shooting a young girl. Family members he held hostage were released unharmed, but he did not make it off the property alive. SWAT officers filled the home with tear gas after confirming all the hostages were out safely, according to WTOK – that was the beginning of the end. Taken down: Emmanuel Wooten tries to get up after being shot Friday in a standoff with Lauderdale County Sheriff's Department personnel in Meridian, Mississippi . ‘There was a third person who had came out of the house early this morning to verify he was in the house as well as a female who was later taken hostage,’ a police spokesperson told the station. SWAT promised Wooten that if he emerged unarmed with his hands in the air that he would not be harmed – he instead released his girlfriend and cousin, police said. ‘We set up a hard perimeter around the house. The one male individual left the house and was taken into custody,’ the spokesperson continued. ‘He provided us with information to verify the individual was in the house as well as a female. We continued communications with the individual in the house via text messages.’ Dead at the scene: Members of the Lauderdale County Sheriff's Department SWAT team surround Wooten after he was shot . Freed: A SWAT officer evacuates a woman to safety during the standoff . The officers then tossed tear gas canisters into the home to flush him out. He fired three gunshots at the officers before emerging just after 12.30 p.m., police said. The wanted man continued blasting away as he came out of the front entrance to the home, the officers had no choice but to return fire, sources told the station. He was pronounced dead at the scene, authorities said. Wooten was the primary suspect in the shooting last week of a 10-year-old, according to WTOK. She is still recovering from her injuries but is expected to live, authorities said. The fugitive exchanged more than a dozen shots with officers earlier this week, a witness told the Meridian Star. He was injured in the shootout but had not surfaced until Friday.","Emmanuel Wooten was shot dead by police as he ran out of a home firing a gun after a three-hour standoff .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated Press Reporter . The passengers aboard a sailboat that sank Thursday night in a storm about 900 miles of the coast of Bermuda are lucky to be alive, according to the ship's captain. 'We were preparing to die,' sailboat owner Leonard Rorke, 55, of the United Kingdom, told the Coast Guard in a recording posted to the agency's website. He, wife Lisa Rorke, 50, and 29-year-old Henri Worthalter, of Belgium, and a dog named Dexter were instead saved by the crew of a passing freighter. Saved: Henri Worthalter (left), 29, Lisa Rorke (center), 50, and ship owner Leonaqrd, 55, were rescued Friday from the Atlantic Ocean with their dog Dexter after it sank during a storm .

It was life and . death,' he said in the recording. 'We're very . grateful. We are very, very lucky.' The sailboat sank after the bulkhead broke up and the vessel began taking on water, he recalled. 'We had lost everything.' Except for their Jack Russell Terrier. Safe and sound: Lisa Rorke (left and a right with husband Leonard) was saved from what appeared to be certain death .

Three ships answered the call and diverted their course to aid in the . search. The sailboat's crew had an electronic position-indicating radio beacon in the life raft that allowed the Coast Guard to direct ships toward their location. Poor visibility, 25-foot waves and winds reaching about 40 miles per hour, hampered search efforts as the trio was forced to patch their rickety life raft they held on to 'for dear life.' The ordeal ended about 12:30 a.m. after the Tilda Kosan diverted course from its planned trip to Mexico. The ship found the life raft after making three passes in dark, stormy conditions. It was about 36 miles away from the life raft when it first joined the search. 'They were fantastic, absolutely fantastic. They didn't play around. They were super quick,' he said of the Coast Guard and his rescuers.

"By . Julian Robinson . A giant robotic hand arches down and locks its metallic fingers around a car like a scene from a futuristic film. With frightening power it clamps the roof of the green Panda and uses its superhuman robot strength to hold it aloft. With frightening power it squeezes the vehicle's frame as if it were no stronger than paper, smashing through the windows and crumpling the body work. RoboHand, a giant robotic hand with hydraulically-powered fingers, crushes a green Panda at Life Science Centre in Newcastle . RoboHand is the attraction that has been dazzling audiences at the Maker Faire UK, a science technology and arts and craft extravaganza at Newcastle's Life Science Centre. The vast contraption is 30 times larger than an average human hand, with an arm measuring eight meters and weighing in at six tons. Hydraulically powered fingers give the hand enough strength to crush almost anything put before it. The fearsome RoboHand makes light work of a Panda car, as it hoists it aloft in front of the crowds at Newcastle's Maker Faire UK . Crowds watch on as the eight metre arm uses its superhuman strength and grip to lift a car in to the air at the Life Sciences Centre in Newcastle . Originally commissioned for the 2007 Robodock Festival in the Netherlands, Robohand is the brain-child of American artist Christian Ristow. It was built from recycled scrap-metal and due to its huge size, was destined for a return to the junk yard following its festival appearance. But after its owners made modifications, Robohand is now a sustainable and transportable art object which tours internationally. The big squeeze: After hoisting the four-door car in to the air, Robohand's hydraulically-powered fingers easily crush its roof and boot, having already made light work of the windows . With its boot and roof now crumpled, the car hangs precariously from RoboHand's thumb. the giant mechanical crusher's fingers are released as the vehicle's fate is sealed . The RoboHand is the headline act at the Maker Faire UK in Newcastle, which is expected to draw in 10,000 visitors . As well as cars, objects set to face its mangling power during the festival include washing machines, oil drums, wardrobes and pianos. The two day festival is expected to draw in around 10,000 visitors. Design, engineering and science fans can expect a range of other attractions including an eco-friendly pink wheelie bin giant, 3D printers and a fire breathing dragon.

"By . Chris Pleasance . A toddler's beating heart was exposed through a hole in his chest for five days after a life-saving operation to flip it over. Doctors worked for ten hours to perform the complex surgery on three-year-old Carson Ayre, who was born with his heart back to front. The youngster had transposition of the great arteries, an extremely rare and life-threatening deformity, which would have resulted in heart failure. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Toddler Carson Ayre was born with transposition of the great arteries, a life-threatening condition meaning his heart was back to front. He had to have an extremely complex operation to flip the organ round the right way . The serious condition meant his heart's chambers and the veins and arteries which carry the blood were the wrong way around. A team of experts tirelessly worked at Leicester's Glenfield Hospital to flip the vital organ back the right way round during a pioneering procedure three weeks ago. They then left the toddler's chest open for five days to allow the swelling on his heart to go down. Parents Danicka, 27, and Luke, 25, were able to watch and made an incredible video of their son's heart beating through the hole in his chest while they maintained a bedside vigil. The couple, who live in Carlton, Notts., thanked experts for giving saving their toddlers life. Luke, who works as a care assistant in a nursing home, said: 'We're very proud. He's absolutely shocked us. 'He was out [of hospital] in two weeks when they said it would be a month. We were very pessimistic about the entire situation - we thought this was it. 'So to see him get through, no words can describe it. Some of the children that were on the ward were just waiting to die - we were just one of the lucky ones where everything turned out great.' The dad-of-two was also full of praise for consultant Giles Peek and the team - who jetted in from London to save his son's life. It took a team of specialist surgeons ten hours to complete the procedure. They then left a hole is his chest for five days, with his beating heart visible through it, while the swelling went down . He added: 'He is one of the very few people who can do this kind of surgery and they brought in people especially to help him do it. 'We had all the best people in the UK to do it - that was very reassuring. We can't thank them enough.' Remarkably, the operation was the third open heart surgery little Carson has had in the last three years. He initially went under the knife just weeks after he was born and then had a pacemaker fitter when he was just nine-months-old. And the toddler finally underwent the corrective surgery three weeks ago - with his delighted parents able to sit by his bedside 10 hours after the operation. Mr Peek, a consultant surgeon at Leicester's Glenfield Hospital, described the operation as one of the rarest they do. He said: 'Carson had one of the most complicated heart conditions and the operation, which we call a double switch, is one of the most complex operations that we do. 'There are 153 operations that we do and this is one of the rarest. 'I'm very pleased with him, he's done very well. With any major heart operation we don't know what's going to happen but we're very pleased with how well he's done so far. 'It's wonderful when the children do well and it's soul destroying when they don't.'","Carson Ayre born with rare condition meaning his heart was back to front .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . An inquest in to the death of Peaches Geldof will be opened next week - with a cause of death expected to be released . An inquest will be opened into the death of Peaches Geldof next week, it has been confirmed. The 25-year-old mother of two, daughter of Sir Bob Geldof, was found dead at her country home earlier this month in what was described by police as a 'non-suspicious' and 'sudden unexplained' death. A post mortem carried out by a Home Office Pathologist days after she died proved inconclusive and samples of her blood and tissue were sent off to a laboratory to be tested for any possible toxins. It is understood those results have now been returned to North West Kent Coroner Roger Hatch who will open an inquest into Peaches's death next Thursday, May 1. The hearing is only expected to last around 10 minutes. A spokesman for Mr Hatch said a statement from a senior police officer will be heard and the coroner will release the cause of death. A date for a full inquest into the model and TV presenter's death is due to be set some time in late July, the spokesman added. The body of Peaches was found on April 7 at the home she shared in Wrotham, Kent, with her husband Tom Cohen, and their two young sons, Astala, 23 months, and 11-month-old Phaedra. At the funeral service in the village of Davington, near Faversham, Peaches' body was carried into church in a poignantly-decorated coffin which included a picture of her young family. Her father Sir Bob Geldof is thought to have led tributes in front of a host of well-known personalities, including Sarah Ferguson, supermodel Kate Moss and former Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman. The church, St Mary Magdalene and St Lawrence, was where Ms Geldof married musician Mr Cohen in 2012. It was also where her television presenter mother Paula Yates married Geldof in 1986. Yates' funeral was held there after she died from an accidental heroin overdose in 2000, aged 41. Former Boomtown Rats singer Geldof has previously paid tribute to his daughter alongside his partner Jeanne Marine and Ms Geldof's sisters Fifi Trixibelle, Pixie and Tiger, saying she was the 'wildest, funniest, cleverest, wittiest and the most bonkers of all of us.' Peaches pictured with her musician fatehr Sir Bob Geldof in 2009. He is believed to have led tributes to the model and television presenter at her funeral last week. He added: 'Writing ‘was’ destroys me afresh. What a beautiful child. How is this possible that we will not see her again? How is that bearable? 'We loved her and will cherish her forever. How sad that sentence is. 'Tom and her sons Astala and Phaedra will always belong in our family, fractured so often, but never broken. Bob, Jeanne, Fifi, Pixie and Tiger Geldof.' Her husband Tom Cohen said in a statement: 'My beloved wife Peaches was adored by myself and her two sons Astala and Phaedra and I shall bring them up with their mother in their hearts every day.'

"By . Kieran Corcoran . He's known to millions of fans worldwide as Lord Eddard Stark - the doomed nobleman who loses his head to the deadly politics of hit fantasy series Game of Thrones. But actor Sean Bean - also famous for appearances in the Lord of the Rings and Sharpe - has found himself caught up in a real-life turf war over plans to expand £4million his North London home. The 55-year-old star, originally from Sheffield, today lost the latest round of his bid to build an open-air terrace on top of his four-bedroom house in Belsize Park. Planning row: Sean Bean, pictured with actress Ashley Moore last year . Caught up: Sean Bean, pictured in Game of Thrones, has landed in a real-life turf war . Row: Sean Bean is battling neighbours with plans for a leafy terrace on the roof of his £4million London home . Views: Looking from the existing flat roof . northwards over the ground floor (top and bottom left), and looking from . the existing flat roof east (top and bottom right). Planning inspector David Barnes visited the site and said that he could see into neighbouring properties from the roof . His plans were shot down by planning officials in 2012 after neighbours complained that the terrace would give Mr Bean and his visitors a clear view into their bedrooms. And the authorities at Camden Council have again sided with the neighbouring families by rejecting an appeal made by the actor. Planning inspector David Barnes turned down the plan, saying that he could clearly see one of Mr Bean's neighbours through a patio window when he made a site visit. The inspector said in his report, that while the roof terrace's design was not 'unduly intrusive or prominent', it would cause 'unacceptable harm' to neighbours. One opponent, who lodged an official . objection to the council, wrote: ‘Terrace very intrusive and prominently . sited and highly visible from all round.’ Plans . show a second-floor flat roof which Mr Bean wants to turn into a . terrace and then screen with a mixture of olive, bay and laurel trees . and a glass wall, with double doors leading into a bedroom. The actor's architect, David Mercer, had . said in the application that the terrace would not 'result in . overlooking, loss of daylight or amenity to adjoining properties'. Famed: The actor, pictured in ITV drama Sharpe, has been trying to force through the terrace plans since 2012 .

As it stands: A view from the flat roof looking south towards existing access from dormer windows . Desirable neighbourhood: Mr Bean, who bought his four-bedroom home in 1998, launched an appeal against the latest refusal on March 13 . Mr Bean's team had also argued that the terrace would have been partly concealed behind a 6ft privacy screen. The street is in a conservation zone and it is harder than usual to obtain planning consent. The actor, who has been married four times, bought his elegant four-bedroom home 15 years ago. At the time, he was married to one of his ex-wives, Abigail Cruttenden. The pair divorced in 2000. He is understood to have paid £1.5million for the property. Mr Bean's publicists declined to comment.","The actor, 55, has fought for two years to expand his four-bedroom home .

"By . Associated Press . A mentally ill, homeless former Marine who died in an overheated jail cell more than two months ago was a giving and kind person, his relatives said Friday during a modest family funeral. 'You're going to be missed, Big Bro,' a tearful Cheryl Warner said at the poignant farewell for 56-year-old Jerome Murdough. His body lay in a closed, blue-grey casket decorated with purple and white flowers at a Queens funeral home before it was hoisted into a hearse for burial in New Jersey.

Eulogy: Cheryl Warner, the sister of Jerome Murdough, delivers remarks during his funeral . Blessings: Victoria Murdough, the daughter of Jerome Murdough, touches his casket after his funeral at the Cobbs Funeral Chapel. A modest family funeral was held for the homeless former Marine who was found dead more than two months ago in an overheated New York City jail cell . Displayed photos depicted happier times: a . smiling Murdough in a black turtleneck sweater and jaunty hat; the . proud Marine posing in his dress uniform. The medical examiner says more tests are . needed to determine how Murdough died alone in a Rikers Island jail . cell. But officials have said  his cell had overheated to at least 100 . degrees, apparently caused by malfunctioning equipment, when he was . discovered on February 15. He hadn't been checked on for at least four hours, they said, and he didn't open a small window in his cell to let in cool air as other inmates nearby did. One of his daughters, Victoria Murdough, of Philadelphia, said he was 'a good, caring guy.' 'This has been so painful,' said the daughter, who had not seen him for years. 'I just want to see justice.' Saying farewell: Lakisha Murdough, left, and Cheryl Warner, the daughter and sister of Jerome Murdough, pause at his casket before his funeral . Final goodbye: The casket of Jerome Murdough is wheeled to a hearse after his funeral. Murdough died in a Rikers Island jail cell during one of the coldest recorded winters in city history. Multiple city officials say was at least 100 degrees when his body was discovered . Remembered: Alma Murdough and her daughter Cheryl Warner hold a photo of Murdough's son, Jerome Murdough, a mentally ill, homeless former Marine arrested for sleeping in the roof landing of a New York City public housing project . Murdough suffered from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, his family said. He was on anti-psychotic and anti-seizure medication, which officials said could have made him more sensitive to the heat. One of the officials, who all spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss specifics of the case, said Murdough 'basically baked to death.' Murdough's 75-year-old mother, Alma Murdough, wasn't notified of his death until the AP contacted her a month later. In the wake of the death, which Mayor Bill de Blasio has called 'very troubling,' the Department of Correction has disciplined the warden in charge of the 2,100-inmate facility where Murdough was housed, the mechanics supervisor and the correction officer assigned to patrol his unit. Downward spiral: After leaving the military,  Murdough started indulging in alcohol, and he would often disappear for months at a time . Grieving mother: Alma Murdough's son was arrested in February for sleeping in the roof landing of a New York City public housing project during one of the coldest recorded winters in city history . Holding him close: Alma Murdough and her daughter Cheryl Warner hold a photo of Murdough's son, Jerome Murdough, 56, a mentally ill, homeless former Marine who died in a Rikers Island jail cell that was at least 100 degrees . Source of pride: A letter to Alma Murdough from the United States Marine Corps announcing the promotion of her son Jerome Murdough to the rank of Private First Class . Advocates for the mentally ill say Murdough's death epitomizes flaws with how the criminal justice system interacts with people who have regular contact with it. De Blasio's new Correction commissioner, Joseph Ponte, has vowed to reform the city's jails. Of the roughly 12,000 inmates who make up the nation's second-largest jail system, about 40 percent are mentally ill and a third of those suffer from serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Murdough, whose family said he struggled throughout his adult life with mental illness and alcoholism, was sent to Rikers following his February 7 arrest on a misdemeanor trespassing charge for sleeping in an enclosed stairwell of a Harlem public housing building because he couldn't make the $2,500 bail that was set for him, according to court records. Murdough was discharged as a private first class from the Marine Corps and served from 1975 to 1978 as a field artillery batteryman, according to the Marines Corps. His relatives said they hadn't been able to reach Marine officials to arrange a military funeral. The Marine Corps didn't respond to a request for comment. Warrior: Murdough grew up in Queens and joined the Marine Corps out of high school, doing at least one tour of duty in Okinawa, Japan . An awful way to go: A malfunctioning damper diverted heat to the top level of a two-tier observation unit where a mentally ill, homeless veteran inmate 'basically baked to death' Death of military man: Jerome Murdough, a mentally ill, homeless former Marine died here in Rikers Island prison when the temperature in his cell rose to 100 degrees .","Jerome Murdough, 56, had internal body temperature of at least 100 degrees when he was found dead in a cell in Rikers Island February 15 .

"By . Tara Brady . and Meghan Keneally . and Ryan Gorman . Dr Jerry Umanos was a married father and practicing pediatrician who moved from Chicago to Kabul nine years ago before being shot dead this week . The widow of one of three doctors shot dead by gunmen in Afghanistan has remarkably forgiven her husband’s killer. Jan Schuitema Umanos, wife of slain U.S. pediatrician Jerry Umanos, said during a Thursday press conference that she loves the Afghan people and her ‘heart aches’ for them.’ One of the three American doctors killed in Afghanistan has been identified as a pediatrician who 'felt called' to move to Kabul. Dr Jerry Umanos practiced in the inner-city of Chicago before moving to Afghanistan nine years ago to help provide care for children in the war torn country. Dr Umanos and a father and son who were visitng Cure International Hospital were killed at the western Kabul center on Thursday morning after an Afghan security guard opened fire. The names of the related victims have not yet been released. Wife Jan Umanos said in a prepared statement during a press conference aired by ABC that 'our family has suffered a great loss... We are also aching for the loss of the other families… as well as the loss that the Afghan people have experienced. 'My heart aches for the Afghan people.' The couple's son stood by her side and rubbed her shoulder as she continued. 'I know Jerry would also like everybody to know about his love for the Afghan people,' said the grieving woman. 'We don’t hold any ill will towards the Afghan people in general or even the gunman who did this. 'My heart aches': Jan Umanos forgave her husband's killer and pleaded for people to provide more aid to Afghanistan .

'I would like people who hear this to understand that the Afghan people are no different than us,' said the widow. 'Jerry always wanted us to serve under-served populations and Afghanistan was just one of them.' Former colleagues of the family man also weighed in on his tragic death. 'He was a loving, caring physician,' his former colleague Dr Bruce Rowell told CNN, adding that Dr Umanos treated his patients 'with the utmost of respect.' 'He loved the country, he loved the people, he loved to teach. 'As much as we love and miss him, all of us have a certain level of respect and contentment knowing Jerry died doing what he loved most.' Dr Umanos' wife Jan and their adult children all live in the United States. He had been living and working in Kabul for nine years, making him the longest-serving doctor at the facility. He didn't limit his care to the training facility which also treats children, but he also worked at a community health center.

"By . Lydia Warren . A 15-year-old girl who encouraged her autistic boyfriend to shave off his eyebrows, have sex with the family dog and walk across dangerously-thin ice on a frozen lake - all while filming him - has been sentenced to a maximum of six years in a state juvenile detention. The unnamed teen, who was reportedly dating the boy, received the sentence in St Mary's County, Maryland on Thursday after previously pleading guilty to second-degree assault and displaying an obscene photograph of a boy. She was arrested last month with a friend, 17-year-old Lauren Bush, after a classmate at Chopticon High School learned about the videos in which they allegedly tormented the boy. Bush has been charged as an adult with first-degree assault, false imprisonment and child-pornography solicitation. She faces up to 80 years in prison if convicted - but her parents and lawyers are battling for her to be charged as a juvenile instead. Scroll down for video . Scene: A former student of Chopticon High School in Morganza, Maryland has been sentenced to 6 years in a juvenile detention center for tormenting a 16-year-old autistic boy and filming it . Bush, who allegedly held a knife to the boy's throat, is undergoing several weeks of psychological examinations at a state juvenile detention center, the Washington Post reported. On Thursday, before the 15-year-old was sentenced, she had asked the judge to be placed in a community-based treatment program, rather than jail. 'I just feel a not-lockdown facility is going to be best for me,' the girl, dressed in a pink hoodie, said. 'Of course you do,' Judge Michael Stamm responded sarcastically, the Post noted. He ignored her pleas for leniency and branded her treatment of the boy 'horrific'. He said she posed a danger to the community. She will now remain at a secure juvenile facility until she is 21 - but she could be released before if authorities deem that her rehabilitation is progressing quickly, the Post reported. 'Cruel': Another girl, Lauren Bush, 17, also allegedly mistreated the boy and faces 80 years in prison . The sentencing comes days after the 16-year-old victim said he wanted the charges against the girls dropped. He said he considers Bush and the 15-year-old girl, who was his girlfriend, to be his friends. 'It really makes me upset that my parents want to see them in jail,' he told the Washington Post in an earlier interview. 'Because I really like them.' He said the girls never intended to kill him - even when they held a knife to his neck and led him to a frozen lake and persuaded him to fetch a basketball on the ice. Minutes later, he fell through the ice and screamed, but the girls did nothing to help, he said. Afterwards, they wouldn't allow him to ride with them and he returned home wet. 'They put me in the trunk,' he said. 'They didn't want to get the interior wet.' His parents, however, said they want Bush to be tried as an adult. 'My son is a staunch defender of his . tormentors; itâ€™s embarrassing,' his father told the Post. 'He may be more disabled than I . convinced myself that he was and maybe more lost than I realized. That's . something I am going to have to deal with on a later day. Right now, I . am trying to get justice for him and others like him.' Their cruel treatment was uncovered after a fellow student heard about the videos and told school authorities.

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . 'Carnage': Chris Packham said he was willing to get shot to get his message across . Police grilled BBC wildlife presenter Chris Packham for five hours yesterday after he tried to film hunters slaughtering migratory birds in the Mediterranean. The Springwatch presenter was quizzed in Malta after videoing hunters for his website. The hunters claimed the footage he shot had breached their privacy. Packham, 51, told Malta Today newspaper that, at one point, he was threatened with arrest but said: ‘I did everything I could to be co-operative.’ The animal-lover said he wanted to cover the ‘carnage like a news team reporting a war’. Before going to the island, he said: ‘I don’t care if I get shot. If that’s the cost of getting the message across that birds we expect to see in our gardens are dead in some Maltese field because of this senseless slaughter, I’m willing to pay the price.’ Packham voluntarily attended questioning, his agent said. Last month, The Mail on Sunday reported how Prince Charles had condemned the ‘industrial scale killing’ of songbirds by ‘serious organised criminals’ in the Mediterranean. Malta has 10,750 registered hunters who are legally only allowed to shoot turtle doves and quail. However, charity BirdLife International claims four million birds are killed every year, including three million finches.","Springwatch presenter was quizzed by police after filming hunters in Malta .

"By . Valerie Elliott . Banned: Mangos from India are set to disappear from British shelves after an EU ruling . It’s the exotic fruit known for its sweet, perfumed flesh and is adored by top chefs such as Gordon Ramsay. But mangos imported from India are set to disappear from our shelves amid fears that shipments contain a pest that could destroy British tomato and cucumber crops. The news has infuriated Asian shopkeepers and restaurant owners, who stand to lose thousands of pounds due to a European-wide ban on the fruit that begins on Thursday. About 16million mangos from India are imported by the UK in a market worth nearly £6million a year. The EU move – backed by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs – could not come at a worse time. The peak season is about to begin for the more expensive alphonso variety, known as the king of mangoes and used in puddings and the popular smoothie mango lassi. The ban has been introduced because some mango shipments have contained tobacco whitefly, which could affect Britain’s £320 million-a-year salad industry. Monica Bhandari, of importers Fruity Fresh (Western) Ltd, based in West London, said her firm would lose out significantly and added: ‘It’s madness. Mangos will be burned in India because there will be no market for them.’ Jay Rayarel, manager at ATC Retail in Leicester, which sells 36,000 alphonso mangos a week when they are in season, said his firm would lose business worth £200,000, adding: ‘The ban will be devastating.’ Expensive: The Alphonso variety of the fruit - known as the king of mangos - will be among those banned . Environment Minister Lord de Mauley said he was working closely with his Indian and EU counterparts to resolve the issue. In a recipe for chocolate mousse with chilli and mango, Gordon Ramsay says: ‘If you can get a sweet, perfumed alphonso mango in season so much the better.’ The EU ban is also set to hit supplies of Indian aubergines, gourds and patra leaves.","Indian mango market is worth almost £6million to the UK economy .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Texas mother is facing possible charges after a pet raccoon attacked her two-week-old infant. Officers were called to a mobile home in Kountze where they found Brittany Darby, 19, holding her baby boy, who was bleeding profusely from lacerations across his left eye and the top of his head. The newborn was flown to Texas Children's Hospital in Houston where he was treated for two days before he was released into the care of his mother. Wild animal: Two pet raccoons were euthanized after one attacked a newborn baby boy, causing lacerations to his face (stock image) Precaution: The baby's mother is facing charges from police for endangering her baby, and also Texas Parks and Wildlife for keeping the raccoons without a permit . The animal and another raccoon kept as pets in the home were euthanized on the scene as a safety precaution. According to KBMT, the animals were being kept without a proper license or permit. Police say a preliminary investigation indicates the baby was left inside the home with the two raccoons. Darby's . boyfriend entered the home after hearing the baby screaming and found . one of the raccoons 'slapping the baby in the face,' reports KBMT. Combative: Members of the Darby family became aggressive when reporters questioned them about the incident outside their home . Wild: Mature raccoons can act aggressively, especially during the mating season, and experts do not recommend the animals are kept as pets . Darby's family became combative when local reporters attempted to speak to them about the incident . 'Go talk to the game warden. Ask him why dogs are running around, but domesticated animals no more harmful than a baby itself was killed,' said one family member. Both raccoons tested negative for rabies. Matt Fortenberry of Beaumont Animal Services told KBMT that if people choose to have raccoons as pets, they risk attack from the creatures. 'You can not take the wild animal out of it,' he said. 'Once it reaches maturity sometimes they will turn and can harm a person.' Darby faces charges of abandoning or endangering a child. She may also face charges from Texas Parks and Wildlife for housing the raccoons without a license.","A two-week-old baby was attacked by a pet raccoon in Texas .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The captain of the U.S. women's hockey team threw out the first pitch at Thursday's series finale between the Yankees and the Red Sox at Boston's Fenway Park, and the Massachusetts native used her moment in the spotlight to take a dig at shamed Yankee pitcher Michael Pineda. Pineda was suspended this week for 10 games after he was caught with pine tar on his neck in the second inning of Wednesday night's game between the two rival clubs - the sticky substance is a big no-no for MLB pitchers as the league believes it can give them an unfair advantage. So when Meghan Duggan took the mound at Fenway on Thursday to deliver the first pitch, she had a little fun at Pineda's expense. Comedian: Meghan Duggan mocks Yankee pitcher Michael Pineda by reaching for her neck in the same spot umpires found illegal pine tar on the Yankee pitcher . Last laugh: The Yankees got the last laugh Thursday, beating the Red Sox 14-5 . Just before she threw her pitch, Duggan jokingly reached to her neck in the same area where the pine tar was found on Pineda. The Yankees got the last laugh, however, spanking the Sox 14-5 for the team's fifth win against Boston so far this season. Pineda was . ejected in the second inning of Wednesday night's 5-1 loss at Fenway . Park after umpires found the pine tar on his neck. After the game, Pineda admitted he had used the pine tar to help him hold the ball on a cool, windy night. 'I'll learn from this mistake,' he said. 'It won't happen again.' Pine . tar is a sticky substance that baseball players will often put on the . handles of their bats to improve grip. Pitchers will use it for the same . reason, particularly in cold weather. However, MLB rules say that a . pitcher can't put any foreign substance on the ball because it can . potentially make the ball move more when a pitcher throws a curve ball. So pitchers will often try and hide it. If they get caught, they are . typically thrown out of the game - and that's exactly what happened to . Pineda. Scroll down for video . Busted: The substance was clearly visible on the pitcher's neck . The . right-hander was thrown out in the second inning when plate umpire . Gerry Davis found the substance on the right side of Pineda's neck after . Red Sox manager John Farrell asked him to check. Pineda walked from the . mound without protest. Both Pineda and Davis said it was pine tar. 'When . it's that obvious, something has got to be said,' Farrell explained . after the game. 'Our awareness was heightened, given what we had seen in . the past.' The ejection also set off a debate in the baseball world about pitchers who use pine tar, and whether it should be allowed in certain circumstances. Many former aces said they had done it, albeit in a more discreet manner. Rule 8.02(b) prohibits pitchers from altering the ball to gain an unfair advantage, and forbids them from having a foreign substance on them or in their possession on the mound. Pineda wasn't seen with the pine tar in the first inning, when the Red Sox roughed him up. Boston manager John Farrell asked plate umpire Gerry Davis to check Pineda after two fast outs the next inning. Got ya: Umpire Gerry Davis determined that the substance on Pineda's neck was pine tar, which is against the rules for pitchers . Earlier . this month, Pineda pitched well against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium. Television cameras showed a substance on his hand during that outing â€” Pineda said it was dirt, not pine tar. Among . other suspensions of pitchers for pine tar in the past decade, Tampa . Bay's Joel Peralta was penalized eight games in 2012, the Angels' Brendan Donnelly 10 days in 2005 and St. Louis' Julian Tavarez 10 days . in 2004. The suspensions of Donnelly and Tavarez were cut to eight days . after they asked the players' association to appeal, and Peralta dropped . his challenge with no reduction. Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said Pineda and the organization were 'embarrassed.' Yankees manager Joe Girardi called it 'an error in judgment' and a 'little bump' and 'poor judgment.' 'He had a hard time gripping the baseball. Unknown to us, he put it on and went out there,' Girardi said. 'It's a young kid. I don't think he's trying to do anything, cheat. I think he's just trying to go out there and compete.' Obvious: Boston manager John Farrell said that when it's as obvious as it was on Pineda, he has to alert the umpires . In Pineda's previous start against the Red Sox, a 4-1 Yankees win in New York on April 10, television cameras caught Pineda with what appeared to be sticky pine tar on his hand on a cool night. Farrell didn't see a photograph of Pineda's hand until the fourth inning; when Pineda came out to warm up for the fifth, his hand was clean. Pineda said the dark substance was dirt but it sparked debate about pitchers' use of sticky substances to get a better grip on cool nights. On Wednesday, with the game time temperature at 50 degrees, Sizemore started the first with a triple and scored on Dustin Pedroia's single. With one out, Mike Napoli singled Pedroia to third. After Mike Carp flied to left, A.J. Pierzynski singled up the middle, scoring Pedroia. After Pineda's ejection, David Phelps came in and completed the strikeout of Sizemore. Trend: A similar brown, sticky substance was seen on Pineda's hand in another game against Boston on April 10 . John Lackey (3-2) allowed one run and seven hits in eight innings with 11 strikeouts and no walks. Koji Uehara struck out three in the ninth in a non-save situation. The previous time Lackey faced the Yankees he allowed four homers in a 7-2 loss on April 12. On Wednesday, he struck out the side in the third then had two strikeouts in each of the next two innings. Mike Napoli had three hits and Boston scored two runs in the first and two more in the third. The Yankees scored on Alfonso Soriano's sacrifice fly in the sixth.","Meghan Duggan, captain of the US women's hockey team, mocked Yankee pitcher Michael Pineda when she threw the first pitch at Thursday's Red Sox game .

"Published: . 16:33 EST, 26 April 2014 . | . Updated: . 17:37 EST, 26 April 2014 . Fresh doubts were voiced last night about Britain’s proposed new high-speed rail line amid warnings that it will not succeed in regenerating the North. A damning report raises fears that promises by David Cameron and other Ministers that High Speed 2 will deliver essential economic benefits are ‘a myth’. It even warns that areas around proposed HS2 stations would be simply ‘Potemkin villages’ - fake regeneration created ‘for political reasons’ using large taxpayer subsidies. The Commons Environmental Audit Committee says more environmental assurances are needed if HS2 is to go ahead. Pictured, a potential HS2 train design . The claims - by respected free-market think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs - come after it emerged that new Treasury Minister Andrea Leadsom had called the economic case for HS2 ‘questionable’. More than 20 Tory MPs are set to rebel this week in Commons votes intended to pave the way for the controversial £50 billion project. HS2 is scheduled to provide a 225mph link between London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds by 2030. Chancellor George Osborne has called the line an ‘engine for growth’ for the North and the Midlands, while the Prime Minister has said the 330-mile network will transform the nation’s ‘economic geography’. But the think tank report – to be published tomorrow – concludes that there is little evidence for the promised major economic benefits. The report, entitled ‘Failure to Transform: High-Speed Rail and the Regeneration Myth’, said similar boasts were made for Britain’s first high-speed line – HS1 in Kent, which cost an estimated £11billion at today’s prices. Dissent: New Treasury Minister Andrea Leadsom has vowed to fight HS2 . According to the report, the line failed to revive the East Kent economy and some parts of the region have similar rates of unemployment to depressed industrial cities in the North. The think tank also cast wider doubt on the benefits of faster rail links by citing the case of Doncaster in South Yorkshire. It argues that Doncaster had ‘enjoyed a fast rail link’ to London for several decades, with its first 125mph ‘High Speed Train’ service introduced in the late 1970s and electrification of the route completed in 1991. Despite that, the town was ranked 42nd worst out of 318 English boroughs in the 2010 Index of Multiple Deprivation. ‘Clearly, a fast rail link to London has not transformed Doncaster,’ the report concludes. It also suggests that any boost to specific areas from having a new HS2 station would be limited. ‘The areas around the HS2 stations will of course be redeveloped if the scheme goes ahead. ‘But these new districts will most likely be “Potemkin villages” – examples of fake regeneration built for political reasons using large taxpayer subsidies and appropriating property from existing owners.’ The criticisms will be seized on by opponents of HS2 who claim the massive expense and upheaval is not justified. Just this weekend it emerged that before she was made a Treasury Minister earlier this month, Northamptonshire MP Mrs Leadsom vowed to fight the project - which passes through her constituency - claiming its economic case was ‘questionable and rapidly deteriorating’. Last night, Government sources were unable to say whether Mrs Leadsom would be taking part in this week’s Commons votes. But the Department for Transport dismissed the think tank report as ‘bizarre’ and insisted the line would provide a ‘huge economic boost’. A source said: ‘The idea that HS1 hasn’t brought significant benefits is just wrong. ‘Just look at the regeneration around King’s Cross or ask the people of Ashford [the site of a HS1 international station]. ‘And the idea that better transport connections don’t help places to grow and prosper is plain bizarre. ‘HS2 will create 100,000 jobs and provide a huge economic boost to the North and Midlands, which is why city leaders across these regions support it.’ Last year, HS2 Ltd, the publicly owned company overseeing the project, published a major study by consultant KPMG claiming the line could boost the UK economy by as much as £15 billion a year. But last night, Tory MP Andrew Bridgen, who is set  to rebel against HS2 in the  votes this week, said: ‘This new report confirms what we know – HS2 will not solve the North/South divide.’","Institute of Economic Affairs questioned value of high-speed line .

"By . Martin Beckford . Kent Police and Crime Commissioner Ann Barnes, left, with the force's Chief Constable Ian Learmonth . A scandal-hit crime tsar has been accused of wasting hundreds of thousands of pounds on a new office and boosting her image while police officers are losing their jobs. Ann Barnes, notorious for employing a foul-mouthed teenager as her youth adviser, has spent almost £200,000 on moving her office less than two miles, and only revealed the costs after an investigation by The Mail on Sunday. Her new base includes a state-of-the-art studio for radio interviews – even though there is already one used by police chiefs yards away on the same site. The independent Police and Crime Commissioner for Kent has spent more than £7,500 on consultants to improve her ‘brand’ and taken control of Kent Police’s press office despite fears the move will jeopardise its independence. Insiders have also revealed allegations of ‘diva-like’ behaviour by Mrs Barnes, including throwing a ‘hissy fit’ when the force’s chief constable appeared on television instead of her. She has even fallen out with police chiefs by parking her battle bus, which she grandly calls Ann Force One, in disabled bays at the force HQ. Last night one senior source said: ‘She is deeply unpopular in the force, and people say her office is a horrible place to work. There was a lot of unease in Kent Police about the money spent on her office when people are losing their jobs.’ The door to her new office, circled, and a map showing the distance from the old site . Another insider added: ‘It’s all about “me me me” with her. She just gets people’s backs up.’ Cllr Rupert Turpin, vice-chairman of the Kent Police and Crime Panel which scrutinises the PCC, said: ‘The public will be mystified as to how the rhetoric of leaving no stone unturned to save the jobs of front line officers has turned into the reality of no-expense-spared office moves, duplicating radio studios and expensive media consultancy. Perhaps the media consultants can advise Mrs Barnes to come clean to the people of Kent about her excessive expenditure.’ Her foul aide: Our story last year . Mrs Barnes, paid £85,000 a year, was elected as the first PCC in Kent in November 2012 despite previously branding the Government’s plan to increase police accountability a ‘wilful waste of money’. She became the most high-profile of the country’s 41 crime tsars a year ago when The Mail on Sunday revealed her £15,000 youth commissioner, Paris Brown, 17, had posted a series of highly offensive comments online. Mrs Barnes is in charge of a single pot of money that must pay for her own office and Kent Police, and chiefs have warned that as many as 100 extra officer posts could be lost when £20million is cut from the budget in 2015-16. Yet last August, Mrs Barnes moved her staff from her old Police Authority offices in central Maidstone to Kent Police headquarters on the outskirts of the town – 1.8 miles away. Sources in the force claim she was offered use of a building at one end of the complex, but refused because it was next to a parade of takeaway food shops. Ann Barnes has been accused of parking her 'bus' in disabled spaces . ‘She wasn’t going to have that because they would be able to smell the chips,’ one source said.Instead, she uprooted the firearms licensing team to take over its rooms, and had a new public entrance built to her office complete with signs, new doors and expensively refurbished sash windows. Inside her office, Mrs Barnes had a soundproofed studio constructed complete with the latest ISDN connections so she could do live radio interviews – even though there is an identical facility yards away in the control room of the police HQ site. Although the move took place last summer, Mrs Barnes is paying rent on her old offices in Gail House –£59,000 a year – until this June. A sign pointing to the office door . But despite being required by law to publish all her spending on items costing more than £500, the details were not made public until this newspaper asked questions about them this week. The only related expenditure listed on Mrs Barnes’s website, until this weekend, was £1,408 paid to a local removals firm. On Friday evening, after The Mail on Sunday asked a series of detailed questions about Mrs Barnes’s spending, she published an article on her website titled: ‘Public money set to be saved after office move.’ She said: ‘Had I renewed the Maidstone office contract it would have been one of the most expensive buildings on the police estate. I just couldn’t justify this during times of police cuts. ‘The move from Maidstone town centre to the excess space at Kent Police HQ will save around £250k over the next five years, and even more in the years after that.’ Mrs Barnes claimed the move cost £150,000 excluding VAT – so with the tax added it would reach £180,000, not including the continued rent on the old building or the construction of the radio studio. A spokesman for Mrs Barnes declined to comment on the allegations about her behaviour, saying: ‘These are based on hearsay.’","Ann Barnes previously made news for hiring a foul-mouthed youth adviser .

"By . Valerie Elliott . Britain will have to import millions of worms to help restore farmland devastated by floods, experts have warned. Stuart Fripp, an agronomist advising farmers on the Somerset Levels, said: ‘We’ve been digging holes in a lot of land that was flooded and we haven’t found any worms at all. ‘They’ve been killed by the weight of the water, which removed all the air from the soil so they could not breathe.’ Shortage: The Somerset Levels will need their worms replacing after they died in the floods . And Professor David Jones from Bangor University, who has been inspecting the flooded fields on behalf of the Government, said: ‘The soil quality on farms affected by flooding is really bad. 'Earthworms are a central part of our ecosystem. But they have disappeared from certain areas and in other places numbers have decreased.’ Worms in the soil show that the ground is healthy enough to allow plants to grow, providing food for insects and small mammals. Without these smaller creatures, birds and larger animals like foxes are deprived of their food source. James Winslade, who runs an 850-acre farm near Bridgwater in Somerset, said: ‘There are no worms, so we’re going to have to find some to put back. Devastation: The floods submerged much of the Somerset Levels earlier this year . ‘I’m doing everything to get the soil back into condition. I just want to get it back to how it was but it’s going to take years.’ Matt Shardlow, from charity Buglife, recommended collecting worms from local meadows and introducing them into fields affected by flooding. But one of the country’s leading worm suppliers, Nigel Baker, pointed out that farmers would need 24,000 worms to restore an acre of farmland – which would cost £2,000. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is increasing the maximum grants for farmers to help their land recover from floods from £5,000 to £35,000. A spokeswoman for the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ‘There is nothing to stop farmers using this cash to buy new worms.’","Experts assessing soil damage on Somerset Levels warned of shortage .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Julie Griffiths, who was reportedly sold her pink terraced house in Talke, Staffordshire . A wife from hell who was given an Asbo for shouting at her own husband has thrilled neighbours by packing up and moving house. But families are now fearing Julie Griffiths and long suffering husband Norman could be moving to a street near them. Mrs Griffiths, 45, has been taken to court on several occasions, with neighbours complaining  for more than a decade of her loud constant ranting at her husband. She was originally handed a five-year Asbo in December 2012 after noise monitoring equipment was installed to measure the volume of her shouting. But she has been accused of breaching the order three times with earning her the tag NAGSBO. However, neighbours next to her pink terraced house in Talke, Staffordshire are delighted that the couple are thought to have agreed a £95,000 sale of their home to a housing firm within days of putting it on the market. One of her neighbours told the Sun: '""I'm happy to say this is the best day of my life — better than my wedding by a mile.' While another added: 'I'm going to the shop to get the champagne in.' Neighbours are reported to have watched a removal van enter the street and load up with the couple then leaving in a taxi. The Griffiths' home is said to have been sold to a housing firm for £95,000 within days of going on the market . The Griffiths lived in Talke, Staffordshire, with neighbours complaining about her shouting for 10 years . And giving advice to her potential new . neighbours, another said: 'Today is great for everyone on Church Street — . but it is the start of a nightmare for some other folk. I hope they . have industrial-strength sound proofing.' Complaints have been made against her outbursts since 1999, and it was around thirteen years before she received her Asbo in December 2012. The ruling prohibited her from creating noise audible to neighbouring properties, shouting, screaming or banging on internal doors and communicating with certain neighbours. Mrs Griffiths was riginally handed a five-year Asbo in December 2012 after noise monitoring equipment was installed to measure the volume of her shouting . Earlier this year she was fined for the noise she made when berating 64-year-old Mr Griffiths for buying the wrong type of scratch card. This was before a third court appearance where she was accused laying into her partner's hygiene.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . 'beaten to death': Joele Leotta was killed just six days after moving to the UK . An Italian waiter was beaten to death by a gang of Eastern European migrants in a row over loud music just six days after he moved to the UK, a court heard. Joele Leotta, 20, moved to Maidstone, Kent, from northern Italy with his best friend Alex Galbiati, 20, a jury was told, but died less than a week after arriving. A murder trial at Maidstone Crown Court heard how five Lithuanians broke down the door of the pair's flat, burst in and attacked both of them last October. The men - Aleksandras Zuravliovas, 26,  Tomas Gelezinis, 31, Saulius Tamoliunas, 24, and Linas Zidonis, 21 - allegedly carried out the brutal beating because they thought one of the men had complained to their landlord over loud music. Prosecutors said Mr Galbiati tried to fight back with a metal wardrobe railing, but it was wrestled from his hands and used to beat him. He barricaded himself into the bathroom, the court heard, but his attackers broke in and kept attacking him until he pretended to have been knocked unconscious. After the three-minute attack ended, he found Mr Leotta lying unconscious at the bottom of the stairs that led into the flat. The jury . was played a distressing clip of Mr Galbiati's 999 call in which he . could be heard crying and struggling to speak English as he pleaded for . help. The controller patched in a translator to help with the call but Mr Galbiati struggled to respond. Mr . Leotta went into cardiac arrest at 11.45pm and died from head injuries . at Kingâ€™s College Hospital in London three hours later. Philippa McAtasney QC, prosecuting, said: 'The prosecution suggest that any bad feeling that might have existed on the part of any of the defendants towards the Italian victims must have been harboured by Gelezinis. 'He was the one who was in the danger of being evicted. For what it is worth, the complaint had come from someone else.' Scene: Joele Leotta was allegedly killed by five Lithuanians in his flat in Maidstone Kent. Police were seen outside after his death . 'Music row': The court heard that the Lithuanians may have wrongly believed that Mr Leotta or his flatmate had complained about noise levels .

"By . Julian Robinson . It is the latest Far Eastern food craze that is beginning to take Britain by storm. After Indian curry became a national favourite and with French, Italian and Japanese cuisine already fixtures on many a food lovers’ wish list, now Korean food is emerging as a force to be reckoned with. South Korean cuisine now appears to be a hit among the middle classes looking for 'novelty' foods after Waitrose reported a rise in sales of some of the key ingredients and exports. But while some exotic dishes are flying off the shelves, traditional Korean dishes such as Gaegogi - which is made with dog meat - certainly won't be on sale any time soon. Ingredients used in Korean dishes, such as the ones pictured, are beginning to climb sharply according to Waitrose . Waitrose has seen a 42 per cent increase in sales of the distilled grain spirit, SOJU . The supermarket has seen sales of the 'burned liquor' SOJU rocket by more than 40 per cent. It may have received a helping hand from the South Korean rapper Psy, who has described it as his 'best friend'. The sales boost comes amid estimations that South Korea could become one of the world's top ten exporters of food by 2030. The executive chef at Waitrose, Jonathan Moor, told The . Times: ‘It's got what I refer to as sweet, salty, sour, bitter notes that you're . used to with Vietnamese and Chinese food. ‘It's very light, unlike in some Thai dishes where you can . have a lot of coconut cream.’ South Korea make Kimchi, a traditional Korean side-dish. South Korean is set to become one of the world's top ten food retailers by 2030 . Diners tuck into a barbeque-style Korean feast. The cuisine is fast becoming a fixture among British food lovers . And comparing Korean food to Tapas, he added: ‘Where tapas landed . quite a number of years ago, now people seem to be feeling comfortable with . dishes out of other cuisines. This whole sharing way of eating is very Korean.’ Sales of the components for one of Korea's most famous dishes, Kimchi are also climbing at the up market retailer. The likes of Chinese cabbage, sesame seeds and tofu are beginning to fly off the shelf as shoppers look for fresh culinary inspiration. Meanwhile, there has been no let up from Waitrose shoppers in their quest for other established Asian foods. More than 40 tonnes of Thai basil were snapped up last year while one million sticks of lemongrass were also purchased.","Korean food challenging more established Asian food favourites in Britain .

"By . Jennifer Newton . Samantha Charlton, with husband Michael on their wedding day . A wife has spoken of the terrifying moment she woke up to find her husband kneeling over her trying to strangle her with a purple silk scarf but she is thought to be staying with him. Samantha Charlton, 40, was in bed asleep when her husband Michael returned to their home in Sunderland drunk after attending a funeral. But she woke up to find him on her chest, staring straight at her with a scarf, which had been a present from his mother, wrapped around her throat. He then told her, 'I'm sorry, I need to get rid of you.' She only brought the attack at their Sunderland home to an end using 'all the strength she could muster' to push him away. Charlton, 43, was jailed for two years and eight months for making threats to kill and assault at Newcastle Crown Court. But it is thought she is standing by his side, as the couple celebrate their 10th anniversary, and she didn't want him to go to prison. This is despite her husband previously admitting making threats to kill, affray, criminal damage, dangerous driving and harassment in 2001 against his ex-wife, who left him for another woman. In this latest case, Charlton, of Thorney Close in Sunderland, admitted threatening to kill his wife and assault. After the attack in February Mrs Charlton told police: 'I had good reason to believe I was going to die. 'I think I would be dead if I hadn't managed to push him away.' She managed to flee the house and run to a nearby friend for help. When police arrived at the family home, Charlton, was lying on the bed crying and  told officers: 'I've tried to murder my wife I put the scarf around her neck  to do away with her .

Prosecutor Simon Worthy told the court: 'She woke up to find the defendant in the bedroom. 'She looked up and found the defendant kneeling on her chest, staring into her eyes. 'She described his eyes as looking wide. 'He had a purple coloured scarf, a present from his mother to her, in his hands. 'He had the ends of the scarf around his hands and had a strong grip of it. The couple have just celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary despite the attack . ""He then wrapped the scarf around her neck and said 'I'm sorry, I have to get rid of you'. 'He was looking straight at her. 'She said she assumed he was going to kill her.'

He also added that Charlton hopes to sort out the problems with his wife so they can stay together as a couple. Sentencing, . Judge Simon Hickey told Charlton: 'What aggravates the seriousness of . this case even further is you threatened to kill another partner in the . past.' He . added: 'The concern of the court is, in reading the reports and looking . at your record, is whether on some future date, under similar . pressures, you may again  snap and do something similar or perhaps . something worse and carry out the threat.'","Samantha Charlton woke to find her husband trying to strangle her with a scarf .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A teenage girl pleaded with a hooded knifeman not to hurt her as he forced her to handover £100 from a cashpoint. The terrifying moment when Paul Ward, 26, robbed Chloe Gregory was captured on the Lloyds TSB CCTV system in South Molton, Devon, where Miss Gregory had gone to withdraw cash for her mother. The 18-year-old victim was in tears in court today as she relived the moment she was robbed by the 6ft knifeman. Scroll down for video . Terrifying: The shocking moment that robber Paul Ward, 26, threatened 18-year-old Chloe Gregory by forcing her to withdraw £100 from her bank account as he held a six-inch kitchen knife . The court was told he had armed himself with a black-handled knife with a six-inch serrated blade before carrying out the robbery. Ward, who admitted robbery and possessing a kitchen knife, was said to be sorry for what he had done. His defence barrister said it would be an injustice if he was not jailed for the crime. But Miss Gregory's family left court in anger after Ward was jailed for just 30 months. Her family said: 'What about how Chloe . feels? It was all about him. We would have been satisfied if he had got . four years.' Exeter Crown Court heard that Chloe Gregory was spending a Friday night with friends when her mother asked her to withdraw some cash. Prosecutor Gordon Richings said the . teenager, who was alone, was checking her account . balance at the bank's ATM when she was suddenly approached by Ward. Miss Gregory, from South Molton, Devon, begged the hooded knifeman not to hurt her as she withdrew the money from the Lloyds TSB cashpoint . Mr Richings said the defendant was wearing a dark raincoat with the hood up and a scarf hiding his nose and mouth as 'a disguise'. He said: 'Chloe Gregory says she was pressing the balance to see how much she had in her account when she felt a light tap on her left shoulder. Ward, who was jailed for 30 months, was said to have walked four miles to South Molton, in desperation for money to buy drugs . 'She turned around and Ward said 'I need £100'.' Mr Richings said Miss Gregory noticed the blade in the robber's right hand. He said: 'She said 'please don't hurt me' and he put the knife away.' Frightened Miss Gregory withdrew the £100 in cash and gave the money to Ward. Afterwards, Ward told Miss Gregory not to 'tell anyone or ring anyone'. He also ordered the teenager not to leave for two minutes until after he had left. Miss Gregory said the incident had left her feeling 'scared and upset'. She can no longer go out alone and fears bumping into Ward again, the court was told. Defence barrister Sean Brunton said Ward wanted to make a 'complete and utterly unreserved apology' to the teenager. He said: 'In his words he must be punished severely and if he is not sent to custody Miss Gregory would have been short changed. 'He looks like a boy and this was an aberration. 'He had walked four miles to South Molton that evening out of desperation to get money for drugs. Young Chloe was in the wrong place at the wrong time. 'He followed her into a cash ATM atrium and he saw she had £300 on her balance and he asked for £100 and then puts the knife away. He was not brandishing the knife of threatening her, although it was exceedingly frightening for her.' Mr Brunton said Ward was a 'bright boy' who messed up his GCSEs when he was 16 and has been drifting for the last ten years and hooked on drugs. The defendant, who had been remanded in custody for the last two months, said being jailed was 'the best thing that had happened to him' as he was clean, getting an education and feeling fitter. Describing the incident, Mr Brunton said: 'Thank God it did not go any further that that. The defendant is the author of his own misfortune.' But he accepted that the robbery had caused 'utter horror to the young girl minding her own business'. Judge Phillip Wassall said noone expected something like that to happen in nice area such as South Molton. He said he did not agree with the defence's suggestion that the robbery was unplanned, but he did believe it was 'opportunistic'. Detective Constable Daryl Marvelly, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said: 'Although she was unharmed she was clearly shaken up by this distressing incident.' Exeter Crown Court heard that Miss Gregory had been badly affected by the incident. She was said to be scared to go out alone incase Ward recognises her .","Chloe Gregory, 18, was withdrawing money from a cashpoint in South Molton, Devon, when she approached by Paul Ward .

"By . Richard Spillett . Jennifer Marley (pictured) stole from Mavis Patey, whose family say the shock of the betrayal killed the pensioner . A care worker caught stealing cash from a pensioner - who later died from the stress - has walked free from court. Jennifer Marley, 54, took £1,000 from Mavis Patey, but was arrested after the 79-year-old's family became suspicious and set up secret cameras. Mrs Patey's relatives were left furious yesterday after Marley got off with a suspended sentence for her crimes. Mrs Patey's son, Gary McKinnon, said the sentence was 'very lenient' and sent the wrong message to others tempted to steal. He said: 'What do you have to do to get sent to prison? It was just greed. When my mother found out she just lost the will to live. She did not want to go on with her life.' The court heard Mrs Patey's family suspected Marley was stealing and installed security cameras in the elderly woman's house in Plymouth, Devon. After the footage showed Marley rummaging through the OAP's drawers and stealing an envelope containing £1,000 in cash, the family called in the police. Marley, of Plymouth, denied one charge of stealing an envelope containing £1,000 between September and November 2012 and pleaded not guilty to the attempted theft of more cash, in an envelope containing plain paper. But a jury found her guilty of both of those counts following a trial in January. She was acquitted of the theft of two further envelopes containing £1,000, which the family say disappeared from the same chest of drawers. The court heard retired nurse Mrs Patey trusted Marley so much, she asked her to become her preferred carer and take over visits from other care workers. Scroll down for video . Mrs Patey's family set up secret cameras in her home after becoming suspicious of Marley . The images showed the carer looking through the pensioner's drawers and taking envelopes of money . Mrs Patey has since died and her family say she was killed by the shock of watching the CCTV footage. Marley was sentenced to 40-weeks in prison, suspended for two years, at Plymouth Crown Court yesterday. Sentencing . Marley, Judge Paul Darlow said: 'This was a gross breach of . the trust of an old lady who thought she had formed a caring, trusting . relationship. And this is how you repaid her.' Mrs Patey's family say she was left very upset after seeing her trusted carer stealing from her . Despite being found guilty of theft, Marley avoided prison on a suspended sentence this week . Marley had . told the jury she took the money and the fake notes in a bid to attract . the attention of employers First Call, but the judge said he found her explanation 'implausible'. Ali Rafati, for Marley, said she had spent her life in the care industry but would now never work in that field again. Mr Rafati claimed: 'She is a mature woman who is extremely unlikely to appear in court again.' Marley resigned from the agency where she had worked since 2003 after she was interviewed by police.","Jennifer Marley, 54, worked as a carer for Mavis Patey, 79, for six months .

"By . Emma Glanfield . This shocking photograph shows the moment a worker risked his life by standing on the roof of a house while pressuring washing it – landing his firm in court for breaching safety regulations. A passer-by snapped the photo of the worker using the jet washer on the roof of the semi-detached home in Tyldesley, Greater Manchester, in June last year. IQ Roofing Solutions was hauled in front of magistrates after Health and Safety Executive inspectors were alerted to the dangerous safety breach. A passer-by took a photo of the worker using the jet washer on the roof of the semi-detached home in Tyldesley, Greater Manchester, in June last year . Managing director Stuart Bell was ordered to pay thousands of pounds in fines and costs for the actions of the worker – who was cleaning moss and other debris from the roof ahead of other work taking place. Investigators said the man could easily have slipped from the top of the wet roof as there was no scaffolding or safety measures in place. A Health and safety Executive (HSE) inspector visited the site on the day of the incident after a passer-by tipped them off about health and safety breach. The HSE and immediately issued a Prohibition Notice ordering the worker to come down until scaffolding or other safety improvements had been implemented. Trafford Magistrates' Court heard that the firm’s managing director had visited the site on the morning the work was due to start, and so knew it would be carried out without scaffolding around the edge of the roof. The company also failed to provide proof that it held Employers' Liability Insurance - a requirement under UK law - which allows workers to claim compensation if they suffer a workplace injury. The court was told that the company had previously been served with a Prohibition Notice in 2011 relating to unsafe roof work and so was well aware of the dangers. IQ Roofing Solutions was fined £3,000 and ordered to pay £2,000 towards the cost of the prosecution at Trafford Magistrates' Court, pictured. The firm's managing director was also fined for the breach . IQ Roofing Solutions pleaded guilty to two breaches of the Work at Height Regulations 2005 and one breach of the Employers' Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969. The company, of Nelson Street in Tyldesley, was fined £3,000 and ordered to pay £2,000 towards the cost of the prosecution. Stuart Bell, of the same address, was fined £1,000 and ordered to pay prosecution costs of £1,619 after admitting two breaches of the Work at Height Regulations 2005. Speaking after the hearing, HSE inspector Laura Moran said: ‘Falls from height are responsible for around a third of workplace deaths every year, with 25 people losing their lives in 2012/13 alone. ‘I'd therefore like to thank the member of the public who alerted us to the work, as they may well have prevented a serious injury. ‘Both IQ Roofing Solutions and Stuart Bell put workers' lives in danger by allowing them onto a slippery roof without safety measures in place. ‘This meant that workers could have been badly injured if they had slipped and fallen to the ground below. ‘If workers had been injured then they may not have been able to claim compensation as the firm also failed to provide us with any proof that it had Employers' Liability Insurance.’","Passer-by took photo of worker standing on roof in Greater Manchester .

Eastern Europeans will vote 'Yes' in the upcoming Scottish independence referendum winning the campaign for Alex Salmond, according to one political campaigner. Ania Lewandowska, 29, who works for SNP MEP Alyn Smith has said she is confident the party will win the referendum - thanks to the help of 'new Scots' from eastern Europe. Ms Lewandowska said: 'Poles know that change can be for the better - they are not afraid of it. Speaking with The Times, she added: 'Of course, some are still undecided - that's true of any sector of Scottish society - but in my mind most Poles will decide yes.' According to the 2011 census, 55,000 Poles are thought to be living in Scotland. About 30,000 are thought to have registered to vote so far. However, John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, said just 8 per cent of the population were EU citizens - and the likelihood of them engaging in the vote was debatable. He said: 'EU citizens are less likely to be on the register - partly it's motivational, partly it's circumstantial. How much they engage in politics is debatable.' Polls this week suggested the Yes campaign, which once trailed by a wide margin, was now only three points behind the No campaign. Earlier this week, Alex Salmond marked St George's Day by speaking positively about England in a desperate bid to boost support for the break-up of Britain. The First Minister ventured over the Border as far as Carlisle to make a speech claiming a 'strong and enduring friendship' will still endure across the British Isles if Scotland votes to leave the UK in September. In a speech at Carlisle Cathedral, Mr Salmond said people could still live in England and work in Scotland if there is a Yes vote - ignoring warnings of passport controls and separate currencies. He said: 'The ties that bind the nations of these islands will continue and flourish after Scotland becomes independent. Prime Minister David Cameron made a speech on St George's Day urging people to vote for a continued union . 'You will remain Scotland's closest friends, as well as our closest neighbours ... people would still live in Annan and work in Carlisle, or live in Penrith and work in Lockerbie. Friends and family would continue to visit each other.' Meanwhile, David Cameron used the day to urge his countrymen to embrace both Scots and the Union. The Prime Minister issued his own St George's Day message - stressing England's role in creating the enduring 'family of nations' that is the UK. In a video message, he said: 'Let's prove that we can be proud of our individual nations and be committed to our union of nations. Because no matter how great we are alone, we will always be greater together.'","Ania Lewandowska said Poles will vote 'Yes' in upcoming election .

"By . Damien Gayle . A disused mill in east London is reduced to rubble, the twisted metal of a crashed passenger jet half buried in the ruin. Hundreds of people lie injured amid the flames and smoke. The was the scene as London's blue-light services began their biggest ever exercise today, tackling a simulated aeroplane crash near London's Docklands. More than 220 firefighters, paramedics and police officers were deployed at the 'crash site' set up in a building by the Thames to test their joint emergency response procedures. Firefighters help a 'survivor' during the London Fire Brigade's biggest-ever disaster preparedness drill today . Actors pose as injured people during the exercise, which will continue over three days and cost £50,000 . Over 220 firefighters, paramedics and police officers were deployed at the 'crash site' set up in a disused mill . To add realism to the scenario, a real fuselage from a Boeing 737 aircraft lies partially covered with 400 tonnes of rubble and, this afternoon, real flames were flickering and and smoke billowing from the scene. The three-day training drill is being hosted by the London Fire Brigade in and around a derelict Victorian flour mill known as Millennium Mills in London's Docklands. Specialist Urban Search and Rescue teams from London and across the country are working together with members of the Metropolitan Police and the London Ambulance Service. Crash debris and working black box simulators have been sunk in the river for dive teams to recover. Firefighters trained in water rescue will scour the river for 'survivors', with actors from Amputees in Action, an agency which provides amputee actors, playing the part of casualties. A spokesman for the fire brigade told MailOnline: 'An exercise like this has never happened before. It's the largest exercise we've ever been involved. 'We like to do multi-agency exercises on a regular basis whether on this kind of scale or a bit smaller.' He denied that the drill had been planned in response to any specific intelligence. 'The reason why we've held it is because it's a unique opportunity to bring the blue-light services together and practise our life saving skills,' he said. 'We run a large range of various exercises on an annual basis. We've run a large exercise at the Shard and there was another in a high rise in Barking, and of course there was all the exercises done in the run up to the London Olympics.' A real fuselage from a Boeing 737 aircraft lies partially covered with 400 tonnes of rubble to add realism . The drill is happening in and around a old Victorian flour mill known as Millennium Mills in London's Docklands . A London Fire Brigade spokesman denied that the drill had been planned in response to any specific intelligence . The fire brigade spend four weeks painstakingly setting up the crash scene to make it as realistic and challenging as possible. As well as the amputee actors around 100 volunteers from a university paramedic course will play the role of injured people to provide a realistic mass casualty environment. 'It's cost around £50,000,' said the fire brigade's spokesman. 'We managed to keep costs down thanks to many partners who donated their services for free.' Emergency personnel taking part in the drill were kept in the dark about what they would be coming up against. But people living close to the site of the simulation were warned that there would be a large number of emergency service personnel and vehicles in the area for an exercise. London Fire Commissioner Ron Dobson said: 'Whilst this scenario may appear worrying for some, I would like to reassure the public that these sort of exercises are vital to ensure that rescue teams are fully prepared should something like this ever happen in London. 'It is only through this kind of exercise that we can fully test our plans and ensure that all the agencies which would be involved can respond effectively together, in a co-ordinated manner. 'Air traffic incidents are extremely rare, but it is my responsibility to ensure that our fire and rescue teams, working with the other emergency services, are ready in the unlikely circumstance that something catastrophic were to occur with a plane in the capital.'

Commander Peter Terry, head of emergency preparedness for the Met, said: 'Major incident exercises like this one provide us with the perfect opportunity to practice and test our response with our partners in a realistic fast moving environment. 'They also allow us to examine what worked well and what difficulties we faced so we can take that learning and use it to improve our response and co-ordination when dealing with real live incidents in the future.'","More than 220 emergency workers deployed to the scene in East London .

"By . Richard Barber . When Fern Britton was asked to present The Big Allotment Challenge, no one could have known how appropriate a choice it was. For gardening has not only been her hobby and passion, it’s what saved her in her darkest hours. Fern tells today how she has struggled with depression for decades – and while she has also relied on medication in the past, it is the simple pleasure of being in the garden that has proved the best cure. She reveals for the first time how gardening lifted her out of the pit of despair and rescued her from a painful divorce. ‘However busy I am, I always find time to garden,’ Fern says. ‘It does my head good. Ferne Britton said that featuring on the Big Allotment Challenge pulled her out of her darkest hours . During those times when I was unwell and depressed and feeling under pressure, I’d go out into the garden and hours would slide by. It’s the most wonderful therapy. ‘There have been periods in my life when my garden has been particularly important to me. I’ve always thought nurturing something is good for the soul. It’s also good  for your physical and emotional welfare when you can’t see your way out of such despair.’ The 56-year-old is now happily married to TV chef Phil Vickery. They have a 12-year-old daughter, Winnie, and Phil is a loving stepfather to Fern’s children from her first marriage – twins Harry and Jack, 20, and Grace, 17 today. Fern has enjoyed a prosperous career, presenting ITV’s This Morning for ten years before going on to have her own chat show. And in addition to her latest BBC2 series – in which teams tend plots at Mapledurham House in Oxfordshire as they seek to impress the judges with their fruit, veg and flowers – she recently published her fourth novel. Yet for all the outward success, Fern spent years on antidepressants, only giving them up 18 months ago. ‘I always thought I would be on them until I died, because why would I want to stop taking something that was keeping me stable?’  she says. ‘Then something changed and I said, “You’re going to be all right. All the s*** in your life has happened. Nothing can be worse than it has been – you can do it.” ‘I don’t have manic depression, which is a shame really, because it would be nice to feel some highs. But I’m just somewhere underneath the medium line all the time.’ Fern had her first experience of depression as a child and has suffered attacks throughout her adult life. Things were so difficult at one point that she planned to crash her car into a brick wall. When she was 21 she was raped but decided not to tell police. She wrote about the attack  in her 2008 autobiography, My Story, sparking fierce debate about the rights and wrongs of leaving such crimes unreported. The television star came under further attack that year when it was revealed that her 5st weight loss was nothing to do with sensible eating (she was advertising Ryvita at the time) but was thanks to secret gastric surgery. But even when she was young continuity announcer on Westward Television in Devon, the garden was her sanctuary. Fern says: ‘I lived in the Tamar Valley in Cornwall, just over the bridge from Plymouth, in a cottage I rented from a farmer. He let me use a small space in his greenhouse where I tried my hand at growing tomatoes. What I didn’t know was that you had to pinch out the leaves to let the trusses set. But the farmer set me straight and I did get some good results in the end.’ Then, in the first house she bought nearby, she planted gladioli and a willow tree. ‘I’d spend weekends in the garden, planting and digging and sowing a lawn with seed. ‘I readily acknowledge that this wasn’t perhaps the pastime of your average 25-year-old but my mother and father [the actor Tony Britton] were enthusiastic gardeners so it was something I grew up with.’ x . Gardening would again prove a solace when her first marriage, to TV executive Clive Jones, fell apart at the end of the Nineties. Fern found herself a single mother to three children aged under five. ‘I’d be on my own at weekends when the kids were  with their dad,’ she says. ‘I took to the garden as a form of therapy, planting hundreds of daffodils and visiting local garden centres for unusual flowers and plants – seeing my geraniums come into bud gave me real joy. Still does.’ Although she can smile about it now, Fern was at her lowest ebb back then. Even now, 15 years later, her eyes glisten with tears as she says: ‘When you’re very emotional, you get brain tired but not physically tired. That’s when you can’t sleep, however much you want to shut out all the pain. ‘So digging for all I was worth in the garden was a way of getting physically exhausted. My hands would be sore, and my knees and shoulders would ache. I’d get into a hot bath and perhaps have a glass of wine before going to bed and enjoying a deep, replenishing sleep.’ Perhaps, most of all, in the garden Fern doesn’t have to pretend. She explains: ‘It doesn’t involve wearing make-up or looking smart. I don’t have to be smiling or be “life-is-golden Fern Britton.” I don’t have to look as if I haven’t a care in the world. If there have been occasions when I wanted to cry – and quite often there were – then I cried.’ Life is brighter now. She married Phil in 2000 and the couple live in a beautiful house set in two acres in Buckinghamshire with the children and Phil’s labrador Max. Fern says: ‘I was in my mid-40s by the time I had Winnie so we were incredibly lucky to be blessed with a child. Phil and I always say we got in just as the late-night shops were shutting their doors.’ Phil is also a keen gardener and has planted an orchard in the grounds of their home. ‘Yes, he’s out there, stripped to the waist, shifting rocks and splitting logs,’ Fern laughs. ‘A real lumberjack, a proper hunter/gatherer. Phil also has an obsession with grass. I’m responsible for the decorative border, as it were, as  well as the vegetables. I try to get out in the garden every day. It might just be for 20 minutes to open up the greenhouse and water everything but it’s for longer at weekends.’ Apart from writing fiction – her latest novel, A Seaside Affair, has just been published – her chosen private pursuit is being mirrored by her professional life. On its first outing a couple of weeks ago, . The Big Allotment Challenge attracted over 2.5 million viewers, the second most watched show that evening after hospital drama Holby City. Last week, ratings fell slightly as football fans (Phil included) opted to watch Chelsea’s Champions League semi-final, but the presenter says BBC is ‘very happy’ with the show’s performance. As a Twitter convert, Fern is also happy to report that the show was ‘trending’ on Twitter last week – although she admits she has no idea that actually means. ‘Almost all the tweets were positive although one person did say my bottom was as big as a pumpkin but that’s fair enough,’ she laughs. So will there be a new series of the Big Allotment Challenge in 2015?  ‘I honestly don’t know,’ Fern says while simultaneously tapping the side of her nose with some vigour. Certainly, she wouldn’t need to be asked twice to host a second series. ‘I absolutely loved it, but then there’s something so bonding about working with a group of people dedicated to their precious plots of land. ‘If I’m lucky enough to know that my last hour is approaching, I’d ask someone to wheel me out into the garden because that’s where I’d like to die. To lie on the grass and look  at the leaves against the blue sky is a kind of prayer in itself.’","The Big Allotment Challenge presenter reveals how gardening revived her .

"By . Richard Spillett . Former prison nurse Karen Cosford has been barred from practising after she had an affair with inmate serving a life sentence . A former prison nurse who had an affair with a convicted rapist at a top security jail has been ordered to be struck off the nursing register. Married Karen Cosford had a relationship lasting several months with Brian McBride, who was serving a life sentence at Wakefield Prison, West Yorkshire. She denied any wrongdoing at a trial in 2012 but was found guilty of misconduct by engaging in a sexual relationship with an inmate and was jailed for three years. Cosford, 49, of Normanton, Wakefield, was also found guilty of failing to tell prison authorities that McBride had a mobile phone and bringing in top-ups for the prisoner. Today she was barred from practising as a nurse by medical body, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), following her release from prison last November. At her trial, Cosford, who worked in the jail's medical centre, claimed McBride, who is serving life for multiple offences of rape and violence, raped her then intimidated her so she would not report it. But jurors at Leeds Crown Court rejected the claim after hearing how she became inappropriately close to McBride, after he duped her into thinking he had wealth on the outside, and started a sexual relationship. The pair had met as he had a job as a cleaner in the healthcare centre, the court heard. During the trial, the court heard how other officers had stood guard while she went to McBride's cell for sex. She had also written him a love letter, which was found in a bag of sugar. Cosford was jailed over the fling, during which she turned a blind eye to rapist Brian McBride's mobile phone use, but was released last year . An NMC fitness to practise panel in London has now heard that Cosford sent an email last month in which she stated that she felt 'it would be a fruitless exercise to continue fighting to clear my name with the NMC. I hope this will allow you to progress without any further disruption.' And in a letter dated August 23 last year she accepted she had been convicted of the charges and was serving a custodial sentence. Panel chairman Julian Weinberg said it considered she had demonstrated behaviour falling seriously short of the conduct and standards expected of a registered nurse, and that her conduct was a gross breach of trust. The affair happened at High Security Wakefield Prison which houses child killer Mick Philpott and April Jones' murderer, Mark Bridger . Cosford got other wardens to stand guard while she had sex with McBride in his cell, the court heard . Mr Weinberg said: 'There is an expectation for nurses to obey the law and any disregard for the law, particularly in the setting of a maximum security prison, poses a risk to public safety. 'Bearing in mind the need to uphold proper standards and to maintain public confidence in the profession and the NMC as regulator, the panel was satisfied that Mrs Cosford's fitness to practise is currently impaired by reason of her convictions.' The panel concluded that Cosford's conduct and convictions were fundamentally incompatible with her continuing to be a registered nurse. 'The only proportionate and appropriate sanction, sufficient to protect the public and maintain confidence in the profession, is a striking-off order,' Mr Weinberg said.","Karen Cosford met rapist Brian McBride for sex in Wakefield prison .

"By . Emma Glanfield . Princess Diana told how she 'could not help but be deeply moved' after visiting landmine victims in Bosnia in her last official letter . Princess Diana told how she ‘could not help but be deeply moved’ after visiting landmine victims in Bosnia in her last official letter written before her tragic death. The hand-signed note, on Kensington Palace-headed paper, was dated August 11, 1997 and was sent to humanitarian campaigner Dilys Cheetham. In it, the Princess of Wales thanked Ms Cheetham for delivering aid to refugee camps in the Mostar region of Bosnia. The Princess had herself just returned from a three-day visit to Bosnia as part of her crusade against landmines. In the heartfelt letter, she wrote: ‘There was not enough time for me to visit the Mostar area while I was in Bosnia but I was able to visit a number of anti-personnel landmine victims and their families. ‘I could not help but be deeply moved by the experience.’ She added the trip ‘hardened my resolve to ensure the world does not forget that those who have been so needlessly maimed by these terrible weapons will need care and support for many years to come’. The moving letter was sent just weeks before her tragic death in a car crash in Paris on August 31, 1997. It is now expected to fetch up to £3,000 when it is auctioned off in Birmingham next week. Ms Cheetham, from Richmond, North Yorkshire, died in 2006. Before her death she sold the letter to celebrity photographer Jason Fraser in a charity auction to raise money for landmine victims.

The moving letter is the last official note to be written by Princess Diana before her tragic death in a car crash in Paris in 1997 .

The letter is now set to go under the hammer again and will be sold off by Jewellery Quarter-based Fellows Auctioneers on Monday. Mark Huddleston, head of antiques & fine art at Fellows, said: ‘The letter is moving not only because of its heartfelt message but also because it would have been the last ever written by her. ‘It is an incredibly important historical document. Diana was much loved, not just in Britain but around the world.’ In February 2012, two handwritten letters from Diana to her stepmother Countess Spencer were withdrawn from an auction after her family objected.

"By . Ashley Collman . After last year's tragedy at the Boston Marathon, unregistered runners - called bandits - were banned from the race, but many still found a way to fake their way in - including the wife of Foursquare CEO Dennis Crowley. Bandit running is not uncommon in marathons where entry fees can be relatively high - about $175 for the Boston race. Instead of spending money on a genuine marathon number and having to qualify for the race, some people opt to print their own bibs, or purchase them from a third party. Fake number: Chelsea Crowley, top, the wife of Foursquare co-founder Dennis Crowley, pictured bottom, was one of the many unregistered runners - called bandits - who participated in this year's Boston Marathon. The couple shared this photo on race day. While bandits are usually allowed at the race, they were banned this year for security reasons. Pictured above at the race on Monday . Two Kathys?

Kathy Brown discovered that Chelsa Crowley used her number after logging . into Marathonfoto to purchase pictures of herself at Monday's race. She then discovered that another woman . had run with her same number and identified her since Chelsa was wearing . her Twitter handle right under her bib. 'I was a little dumbstruck. I didn't get it at first. I said Marathonfoto must have gotten me confused with someone else,' Brown told WCVB. After posting a picture of herself in the bib on Twitter, another user called her out for the fake and Chelsa, a fashion writer, replied back 'shh!!' Calling her out: A user on Twitter asked Chelsa Crowley is she ran with a fake bib and Chelsa responded with a coy 'shh!!' But her husband, Foursquare co-founder Dennis Crowley, was more forthcoming when confronted by the local news station. Closure: When asked by a local news station, Dennis Crowley admitted his wife ran the race with a fake bib number. He says the two ran the race together last year and wanted to run it again for 'closure'. Crowley is worth an estimated $30million. Pictured above at a charity ball in December 2012 . He said that the two had run last year's race but got split up near the finish line before the bombs went off. While Crowley secured a number because he didn't finish, his wife wasn't able to get one even though she donated $5,000 to charity. Crowley is worth an estimated $30million. Chelsa did end up running under a charity number though. Brown was one of about 25,000 runners in this year's race who earned her number by raising money for charity. Brown had raised money to help fight multiple sclerosis, a cause close to heart since her uncle passed away from the disease. 'I put that work in it and it wasn't fair that someone else didn't have to do that. That was my first thought,' Brown said. Crowley apologized for his wife running on the number and says they didn't mean to offend anyone. 'After running together last year, getting split up and not finishing together, we both felt like we needed to run again and finish together to get closure,' he said in a comment on WCVB's story. He also says he sent an email to Brown, apologizing to her personally. And Chelsa Crowley wasn't the only one running as a bandit this year. A woman in North Carolina was shocked when she logged into the Marathonfoto site and found that four other people, two men and two women, ran under her number. Kara Bonneau, 34, of Durham, believes posting her bib on Instagram two days before the race led to the counterfeiting. The pictured runners either made the fake bibs themselves, or purchased them from a third party. Copycats: Runner Kara Bonneau, pictured, discovered that four other people, two men and two women, ran under her number at this year's race . Who are they? Bonneau posted this photo composite and comment on her Facebook page, asking for help identifying the bandits . Her number: Bonneau posted this picture of her bib on her Instagram two days before the race, and believes the bandits either copied it from there or purchased the fake number from a third party . 'I feel so bad for everybody who worked really hard to get in the race and couldn't,' she told Runner's World magazine. 'It never occurred to me when I was posting that photo that someone could use it in that way. I definitely learned a lesson about posting on social media, but it's really frustrating of all the races, people would do it at this one - and in such a significant year.' Bonneau ran in last year's race just before the bombs went off which inspired to take a second jab at the marathon. She finished this year's race in an impressive 3 1/2 hours. Two of the runners pictured wearing Bonneau's number were wearing shirts representing running companies, and both of those clubs have responded saying they don't know the mystery bandits. One of the men was wearing a singlet representing Heartbreak Hill Running Company in Newton, Mass and the company said on Facebook that while they appreciate his state in shirts, they 'do not appreciate the fact that he ran the race as a bandit with a forged bib. Heartbreak Hill co-owner Dan Fitzgerald says he does not know the man. Another woman was pictured wearing a singlet for Big River Running co. 'We do not recognize her and are appalled she chose to wear one of our singlets while wearing a counterfeit bib,' the company wrote on Fracebook. 'The Big River community is one built on integrity and respect for one another, and these actions donâ€™t reflect what our logo truly represents.' Second time around: Bonneau ran the Boston Marathon last year and finished just before the bombs went off. The tragedy inspired her to tackle the race again in 2014.

"By . Matt Barlow . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . Jose Mourinho was last night simmering on the subjects of ‘respect’ and ‘freedom’ after Chelsea’s attempts to move the title clash at Liverpool were flatly rejected. Chelsea asked the Barclays Premier League, Sky TV and Liverpool if they would agree to hold the game today rather than tomorrow. While the broadcasters were said to be open to the idea, the Premier League ruled it out without consulting Liverpool. Mourinho refused to retract his threat to rest players from the Anfield game, claiming Chelsea had not received the respect they deserved as England’s most successful European team of the last decade. The Stroppy One: Jose Mourinho is fuming after his request to play Liverpool earlier was denied . Head to head: Mourinho has threatened to field a weakened team against Brendan Rodgers' (L) Liverpool . He also promised to help his rivals if the roles were reversed next year. ‘If next season Chelsea play an English team that is playing the Champions League semi-final two or three days later, Chelsea will accept to play the game one or two days before to give the English team more chance,’ he said. ‘We would be protecting English football without creating any problem for Chelsea.’ Mourinho’s ongoing dispute over  fixtures is, however, one of several  struggles with the authorities. The Premier League are investigating his absence from some press conferences recently and he has until Monday to answer his third FA misconduct charge of the season, which relates to the sarcastic congratulations he offered to referee Mike Dean and referees’ chief Mike Riley after losing against Sunderland. ‘I can’t say the truth because I don’t feel free,’ said Mourinho, rekindling memories of the infamous ‘cuffed hands’ salute he aimed at the Italian FA during his time at Inter Milan. ‘I can’t speak. Every time I speak, there’s a consequence. Even when I think the referee is amazing, there’s a reason to be charged.’ The Chelsea boss stressed his priority would be Wednesday’s Champions League semi-final against Atletico Madrid. The tie is goalless after the first leg in Spain. ‘I can’t lose more players,’ he added. ‘You think if I lose one more player, I have any chance to play the final? Lost for words: Mourinho made a cuffed hands gesture to signify his censorship while manager of Inter Milan . In the dock: Mourinho and coach Rui Faria have been charged for incidents after the Sunderland defeat . ‘I don’t think we have a chance. In attacking areas, if I lose one, I have another, but there are positions where I can’t lose one. ‘The most important thing for me is my club and the supporters. Chelsea fans would like Chelsea to get the respect Chelsea deserves. ‘They know what Chelsea has done for English football for the last 10 years. ‘Chelsea has been the most important club to defend this country in European competitions. Blues brothers: Mourinho argues that Chelsea should be treated better as the most important English team in Europe, after winning the Champions League and Europa League . Title deeds: Chelsea travel to Anfield five points behind Liverpool with three game remaining . ‘The last to be European champions, the last to win the Europa League, the club with the record of presence in semi-finals. Chelsea fans, they think Chelsea deserve more respect than they’re getting. ‘They want Chelsea to go to Liverpool and play, as always, at the maximum,  giving everything. With which players? That’s our decision, not your decision. ‘If we are not helped to try to follow our dreams and our objectives, it is one more reason for us to close, to think about us and only us.’ Dropping like flies: Petr Cech will not play again this season after dislocating his shoulder in Spain . Sidelined: John Terry will not play against Liverpool after limping off with an ankle injury against Atletico . Mourinho has claimed all season that English teams are disadvantaged  in Europe because they cannot move games around at will like their rivals, and  dismissed the fact that, this week, Atletico will also play Sunday and Wednesday. ‘Luckily for us, they have no choice,’ he said. Atletico’s fixture happens to be against Valencia, who played in a Europa League semi-final on Thursday. Otherwise, Mourinho thinks that the game would have been played today. He acknowledged the sweetener for  English clubs came in the form of millions of pounds from Sky TV rights but added: ‘Maybe, one day, for seven, eight, nine, 10 years you don’t have a European champion or a team in the semi-finals and the people who pay the big sums says: “Eh, the big teams, the most important teams in Europe aren’t here”. Bigger fish: Mourinho has made Chelsea's return leg against Atletico his priority after a goalless draw . Of the Liverpool game, he said: ‘We are going to try and win,’ but he has big  decisions in defence, where Tomas Kalas and Nathan Ake could be involved, and in goal, where he must choose between Mark Schwarzer and Henrique Hilario, who has not played for nearly three years. Selection will depend on the fitness of John Terry, Eden Hazard and Samuel Eto’o, all ruled out of the trip to Merseyside but who could be ready for Europe. Ramires will not play at Anfield as he is banned for four games after flinging an arm into the face of Sunderland’s Seb Larsson. ‘He’s a lucky guy,’ said Mourinho changing the angle and making Ramires the victim. ‘In less than a minute, he was lucky [Lee] Cattermole didn’t break his leg, lucky that Larsson didn’t break his Achilles and lucky he only got four matches’ suspension. He’s a lucky guy.’ 'Lucky guy': Brazilian Ramires has been hit with a four game ban after being caught lashing out at Sebastian Larsson . He declined to comment on Liverpool’s quest for their first title in 24 years and on the work of his friend Brendan Rodgers this year. These, he said, would be  delivered in private. Nothing either on Daniel Sturridge sold by Chelsea last year or Luis Suarez, who Mourinho has dubbed the ‘King of the Penalties’ this season, other than a reminder to ‘check the stats’. Asked if he thought neutral fans were with Liverpool, he replied: ‘I’m not neutral, I’m Chelsea’ and asked if he thought Steven Gerrard deserved a winner’s medal, he replied: ‘Why? Many big players never won it.’ Despite his glum look, Mourinho insisted he had not lost his taste for English  football. ‘I love it, I love it,’ he said. ‘The fans, the stadiums, the yellow ball in winter, the white ball in summer, the FA Cup final with Hull City, the semi-finals with Sheffield United and Wigan.

Euro stars: The statitstics prove that Chelsea have been the best British team in Europe over the last 10 years . ‘All of this is English football and I love English football.’ His love for Chelsea burns strongly, too, he added, ridiculing the idea he might fancy a move to Manchester United. ‘I don’t know how someone could think about it,’ Mourinho said. ‘I left Real Madrid specifically to come to Chelsea. I signed a four-year contract. I told Chelsea they never have to worry about me because I don’t want to leave. I stay here until the club wants me to leave.’","Jose Mourinho has accused the Premier League of a 'lack of respect'

"By . Dominic King . Follow @@DominicKing_DM . Brendan Rodgers has confirmed he will sign a new long-term deal this summer as he prepares to lock horns with the man who advised him to join Liverpool. Though Rodgers has put all discussions about his future on hold to prevent distractions during Liverpool's title charge, he has revealed it is now simply a case of 'when' rather than 'if' he puts pen-to-paper. It has long been the intentions of Liverpool's owners to reward Rodgers, who has 12 months plus the option for another year on his current contract, but the manager's first priority is stopping Jose Mourinho. Red leader: Brendan Rodgers is ready to sign a new contract to stay at Liverpool . Selection policy: The Liverpool boss revealed that Jose Mourinho (R) advised him to choose the Reds . Rodgers and the Chelsea manager remain . close friends but, as Liverpool home in on their date with destiny, all . acquaintances will be shelved. Nothing is going to disturb Rodgers' focus in what is their biggest domestic fixture for 25 years. 'There . is nothing really (planned) until the end of the season,' said Rodgers, . discussing his future. 'But there is no doubt that, at some point, we . will agree another deal. I am sure of that.' With . each passing week over the last 18 months, Liverpool's decision to . recruit Rodgers has looked increasingly shrewd as they have been . transformed from perennial underachievers to potential champions. And . for that Fenway Sports Group owe Mourinho a small debt of gratitude: . Rodgers was being courted by Tottenham as well as Liverpool but, after . an exchange of text messages, Mourinho nodded his protege in the . direction of Anfield. Who's the boss? Liverpool are five points clear at the top of the Premier League with three games to play . 'Jose . told me to take the job and what a great club Liverpool was,' Rodgers . revealed. 'I had spoken to him on it, he encouraged me about the sheer . scale of the club. I was talking to him about a choice I maybe had, he . knows the size of this. 'It . is a friendship (we have). It has been a continual relationship since . 2004. We have just kept in contact. I have got on with my life and work . and that's it. He's been supportive of me wherever I have been even, in . my time here. 'We might be considered a rival but I know that if they didn’t win the league he would want us to win it.' But . is their relationship strong enough to withstand rivalry? Liverpool and . Chelsea antagonise each other and the increase in tensions stem from . Mourinho's first spell in England, when the clubs played each other 15 . times in three years. Helping hand: Mourinho has been supportive of Rodgers ever since the pair worked together at Chelsea . 'I . understand the history because I was on the opposite side,' said . Rodgers. 'In that period maybe it was made to be the managers (Mourinho . and Rafa Benitez) and that was the rivalry, but I am a different person . and man. 'I only concentrate . on things I can control which is the players and my club. I will always . fight for the club however that may be. I am sure it will be a . brilliant atmosphere because of the past but more important how we are . doing now.' There is little . doubt Anfield will, as Rodgers says, be ""in bloom"" for this game, a . swirling mass of scarves, flags and banners. Liverpool have not been . this close to to the title since 1990 and the locals are trying to lift . them over the line. Sign of the times: Liverpool fans can feel the title returning to Anfield for the first time since 1990 . Cauldron: Former Chelsea defender Glen Johnson knows the atmosphere will be intense at Anfield . It will . be another afternoon when the noise is pumped up to mind-scrambling . levels and Glen Johnson, who was on the Chelsea bench in 2005 during the . fabled Champions League semi-final, has explained the influence Anfield . can have. 'I’ve seen it . from both sides and I remember the atmosphere that night,' said Johnson. 'Of course I didn’t enjoy it at the time but looking back, that is what . you play football for, to be involved in those nights. Whether . I was playing for Liverpool or not, I could appreciate the support. It . definitely takes a bit out of you when you are the away team. When the . atmosphere is that intense, it does give you that extra 10 per cent 'I’m . pretty sure the fans will be like they were against Man City and now we . have to follow up with the same result. If we play like we did that . day, we can beat anyone.'","Brendan Rodgers will sign a new contract at Liverpool .

"By . Carl Markham . Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling is one of Europe's best young players who is set for an outstanding future at Anfield, according to manager Brendan Rodgers. The 19-year-old has enjoyed a brilliant second half of the season with some stellar performances which have propelled him into Roy Hodgson's England squad for the World Cup. Sterling's form has been a key factor in the Reds winning 11 successive league matches to take them to the brink of their first title in 24 years. Liverpool face Chelsea on Sunday, when avoiding defeat would bring the Premier League trophy closer. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Rodgers talk of Liverpool's title challenge . Youth club: Brendan Rodgers rates Raheem Sterling (R) as one of Europe's best young players . Wing man: Sterling has scored 10 goals from wide positions in a sensational second half of the season . 'I made a comment last week that I think he's one of the best young players in European football at the moment and I didn't say it lightly or without thinking,' said Rodgers. 'This is a 19-year-old kid at one of the leading clubs in the world, playing in one of the most competitive leagues in the world. Grown up: The 19-year-old has also matured as a person after some unsavoury incidents earlier in his career . 'And if you look around Europe, you look around the Premier League and at some of our rivals around us, there's no young players playing (at that level). 'You go into Europe and into some of the top leagues, the French, the Spanish and the German, there's not many young players playing. 'Raheem is 19; he's scored 10 goals as a winger. He's been assisting goals and showing a maturity way beyond his years. 'Whether he's playing in front of five supporters or 500,000 supporters, he'll still be the same. 'He is just maturing into a wonderful young man as well as maturing as a footballer. 'Hopefully he can maintain that and keep working towards that, which he is doing. Make us dream! Liverpool are five points clear at the top of the table with three games remaining . 'If he can, we've got an outstanding young player here and will have for a number of years.' At the other end of the scale the 33-year-old Steven Gerrard is driving the side on from a deep midfield role and his significance both in terms of performance and leadership cannot be under-estimated. 'We know what an important player he is for us,' said midfielder Lucas Leiva. 'He drives us on with a lot of positivity and we just have to carry on.' The Brazil international returned to the side last week because of injury to striker Daniel Sturridge, who faces a late assessment to see if he is able to return on Sunday. But there was no time to revel in his recall as they ground out a 3-2 win at Norwich and Lucas knows they have to maintain the same mentality for every one of their last three games. Captain fantastic: Steven Gerrard (C) pushes Liverpool on, says Brazilian midfielder Lucas Leiva (R) 'Since the beginning of the season we wanted Champions League, now we have achieved that,' he said. 'The fans have been fantastic, they have the belief we can do something special this season. 'From here, we just have to carry on in the same way, otherwise we can be punished. There is no easy match here in the Premier League, people probably thought Manchester City would beat Sunderland and so would Chelsea.

"By . Jamie Carragher . When the fixtures for each new season were published, one of the first games I would look for was Newcastle away. Once I knew the dates of the Merseyside derby and the showdowns with Manchester United, I would make a point of finding out when Liverpool would go to St James’ Park as it was always one of the best away days of the season. For starters, more often than not we would come away with three points; I had a good record at St James’ Park — I won seven of the 14 matches I played there in the  Premier League — but it was also one of my favourite arenas. The atmosphere set it apart. You could feel it on the bus ride in, when you would see thousands of fans in those black-and-white shirts lining the street to give you some stick. We used to have a good laugh about it on the coach. Under pressure: Alan Pardew has been the subject of intense criticism from Newcastle fans and local media . I loved . the passion of the Newcastle fans. It was the same with Sunderland. Whenever I was up in the North East,  I always thought they were two . clubs you would love to play for. That . passion, though, would leave both teams vulnerable. Newcastle, for . instance, would always fly out of the blocks but we would sit back, soak . up the pressure, then pick them off on the counter-attack. Nobody . could ever accuse North East football of lacking emotion but that, at . times, is a hindrance and Newcastle manager Alan Pardew was right when . he explained earlier this season how fans can get too high or too low, . depending on results. It does nothing to help with stability. Looking . on from afar at Newcastle and Sunderland, I have constantly been left . scratching my head. Both clubs have all the elements you need for . success — first-class stadiums, excellent training grounds, huge fan . base — yet, they always seem one step from turmoil. Take . Newcastle. Though they lost their first game 4-0 at Manchester City, . not at any stage have they been threatened by relegation and haven’t . been lower than ninth since last autumn, reaching a high of fifth place . on November 30. Given . they flirted with the drop last season then began with that drubbing at . the Etihad Stadium, having failed to make a permanent summer signing, I . expected them to be fighting relegation. That they haven’t is credit to . Pardew. Yet . he is under attack, from fans and, most worryingly, the local media. I . remember when the Liverpool Echo turned against Gerard Houllier and Roy . Hodgson. Once a manager loses the faith of those you would expect to be . sympathetic, it is very difficult to get back onside. Newcastle . have been on a dreadful run, losing their last four games by an . aggregate of 12-0, giving Pardew’s critics ammunition, but he has been . compromised by the injury to his leading scorer, Loic Remy, who has been . out since March 1. Given . the circumstances in which he has been forced to work — Remy only came . in late on loan then his best player, Yohan Cabaye, was sold in January . without being replaced — Pardew has done well this  season, and overall . he’s done a very good job in the three-and-a-half years he has been . there considering he has one of the lowest net spends in the Premier . League. Message: Newcastle fans in the away end at Stoke hold up a banner aimed at Pardew . Loud and clear: Some Newcastle fans have called for Pardew's exit from the club . Make . a comparison with Southampton. They and Newcastle are the only teams . who you would describe as being consistently mid-table; Mauricio . Pochettino is getting praise, and rightly so, but Newcastle haven’t . spent their money. Newcastle . are bigger than Southampton and should be aspiring to be better than . them; they should not have gone 15 years without appearing in a domestic . cup final but until Mike Ashley really invests, it will be difficult to . do anything other than tread water. Southampton . have also had a flurry of young players coming through and it amazes me . that part of the North East, given its size, has not produced any . exciting young talents. What happened to finding the next Chris Waddle, . Alan Shearer or Paul Gascoigne? Newcastle and Liverpool are . similar-sized cities with the same intensity for football but how can no . young kids emerge up there while we’ve produced Steven Gerrard and . Wayne Rooney, while this season Ross Barkley and Jon Flanagan have come . to prominence? Loss: Newcastle have been without striker Loic Remy since March . Switch: Yohan Cabaye, who was the heart of Newcastle's midfield, moved to Paris Saint-Germain . Why . don’t Newcastle — or Sunderland — have young lads coming through? Both . used a director of football this season but whereas Joe Kinnear didn’t . buy enough, Roberto De Fanti bought too many before he was sacked in . January. Sunderland, . with eight defeats in 10 games, are doomed barring a miracle but their . relegation has been coming; their turnover of players and managers in . recent years has been bewildering and success doesn’t breed in . unpredictable environments. Gus . Poyet has had enough time to save Sunderland — compare what Tony Pulis . has done at Crystal Palace in a shorter period — but there is no doubt . he walked into a difficult job at a difficult club to manage. Competition: Southampton are two points ahead of Newcastle in eighth place in the Premier League . Arrival: Jon Flanagan and Ross Barkley are the latest talented youngsters to emerge from Merseyside . In . many ways, you could say the same about Newcastle. They tried to . promote the idea that they want stability but all they succeeded in . doing when giving Pardew an eight-year contract was invite cynicism. The . North East, with its rich history, has given us names that will stand . the test of time; we will never forget Sir Bobby Robson, Kevin Keegan’s . brilliant attacking side of 1995-96 or the Sunderland team that, against . the odds, won the FA Cup in 1973. To . see it now, with both clubs in differing states of turmoil, is a . crying shame. It should be a football hotbed, not a place that is stuck . in the wilderness. Doomed: Sunderland are bottom of the Premier League and look set for relegation to the Championship . To the heavens: Gus Poyet insisted he will not quit as Sunderland boss despite relegation looming . Bale and pace no laughing matter for defenders . My sympathies lay with Marc Bartra on Wednesday night when Gareth Bale turned on his afterburners and raced away. I knew exactly how the Barcelona defender would have felt as Bale’s change of gear reminded me of the night I gave a hopeless chase to Thierry Henry. He actually ran off the pitch, back on again and still flew away from me! Nothing worries you more as a defender than raw pace and the speed of Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo could be the difference when Real Madrid go head-to-head with Bayern Munich for a place in the Champions League final. Bayern are susceptible to counter-attacks, as they are a possession team who play with their full backs high and wide. Flying high: Gareth Bale celebrates his wonder goal for Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey final . Pace: The Welshman was too fast for Marc Bartra as he left him for dead on the way to scoring . Real, who have been quietly building a head of steam in Europe, have the players to exploit them. If . Carlo Ancelotti’s side do progress, it will be more difficult against . Chelsea or Atletico Madrid as neither of those sides will play into . their hands, but I have had a feeling for a while this might be Real’s . year at long last. Threat: Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo could fire Real Madrid to Champions League glory . Many . wondered how Bale would fare after he made his world-record move last . summer from Tottenham but his numbers have been excellent and the goal . to clinch the Copa del Rey was his 20th of the season. It . is great to see Bale excel at the Bernabeu and he will now be hoping to . emulate Steve McManaman, the last British winger to play for Real, and . lead them to that elusive 10th European Cup.","St James' Park was one of my favourite Premier League away days .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A police officer has appeared in court after it is alleged he used his Taser gun on a 10-year-old schoolboy who refused to clean his patrol car. Officer Chris Webb is accused of saying to the boy he would be shown 'what happens to people who do not listen to police' during the event at Tularosa Intermediate School in New Mexico. He is then reported to have fired the 50,000-volt weapon at the boy. Rachel Higgins, legal representative for the seven-stone boy, known only as RD, told Santa Fe County Court he had been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder since the incident on May 4. Shocking: The officer's use of force was completely unreasonable according to the boy's legal representative . According to the complaint filed on behalf of the boy: 'Defendant Webb asked the boy, RD, in a group of boys, who would like to clean his patrol unit. 'A number of boys said that they would. RD, joking, said that he did not want to clean the patrol unit.' Webb is accused of responding by aiming his Taser at the child before saying: 'Let me show you what happens to people who do not listen to the police.' He then allegedly stunned RD. The complaint continued: 'Instead of calling emergency medical personnel, Officer Webb pulled out the barbs and took the boy to the school principal's office.' Incident: The boy was shocked during a careers day at the Tularosa New Mexico Intermediate School . RDâ€™s scars were described in court as similar to those of cigarette burns and Higgins told the court he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. She said: 'The boy, RD, has woken up in the middle of the night holding his chest, afraid he is never going to wake up again.' Higgins added: 'No reasonable officer confronting a situation where the need for force is at its lowest, on a playground with elementary age children, would have deployed the Taser in so reckless a manner as to cause physical and psychological injury. Both the New Mexico Department of Public Safety and Webb are being sued, with Higgins looking for punitive damages for R.D for battery, failure to arrange emergency medical care, excessive force, negligent hiring, training, supervision and retention and unreasonable seizure. The case continues. In trouble: The New Mexico Department of Public Safety is also being sued .","10-year-old hit allegedly hit with 50,000 volt weapon by Officer Chris Webb .

Makeover: The beautiful close-ups of an orange-tip butterfly egg, taken by Kim Taylor, reveal how the tiny insect emerges from into the world just like a chicken . The youngster is smaller than a baby's little finger nail but will soon grow into a much bigger caterpillar before it changes into a pupa to enter the next stage of development. Soon, it will start to chew its way through the developing seed pods of the plant, increasing in size several thousand-fold before changing into a pupa. A caterpillar will eat the seeds, developing . seed pods and flower-heads, with one tiny caterpillar capable of eating up to six garlic . mustard seed pods in a day.

The Orange-tip is a spring butterfly found in gardens, along hedgerows and roadside verges - especially in an area close to water. Females are white with black wing tips, while the males are more distinctive with white wing tips and a dark spot where the white and orange areas of the fore-wing meet. Orange-tip butterflies fly between mid-April and mid-June during which time the females lay their eggs. On hatching, the larvae immediately eat the egg shell before feeding on the host plant. The larvae eat the seeds, developing seed pods and flower-heads. They are capable of eating up to six garlic mustard seed pods in a day. The pupa is the stage in a butterfly's life when it is encased in a chrysalis while it undergoes a dramatic transformation. It remains dormant through the cool wet autumn and freezing winter months, only to hatch into the beautiful mature butterfly. Photographer Kim Taylor, from Surrey, captured the sequence last year. He said: ‘To photograph a caterpillar emerging from an egg requires special equipment and a fair measure of patience. ‘My equipment consisted of a digital camera connected to a microscope objective lens via a home-made bellows. ‘The latter was built from aluminium castings made by my son from melted-down saucepans. ‘The egg needed strong lighting which was provided by a home-made flash unit with four interconnected heads.’ The Orange-tip is a spring butterfly . found in gardens, along hedgerows and roadside verges in area close to water.

'I believe the classic fairytales have a lesson to teach and there are many strong characters which make good role models for children, especially the princesses. 'Beauty and the Beast teaches us beauty is only skin deep, The Princess and the Frog teaches us to work hard to achieve our goals and the newest film, Frozen, teaches us the value of family love. 'These characters are not just relatable for children but are relatable to adults too. She's here to entertain: Gemma charges minimal fees to turn up at birthday parties and her wages from her day job in Game fund her costumes and a steady supply of free gifts for her little fans . Meet and greet: It takes her up to two hours to get ready and her costumes cost up to £120 - but it's all worth it just to see her fans' smiles . 'I love each of the stories and we have all curled up on the sofa with our favourite food and watched a Disney film. It creates a little escape filled with magic, laughter and love.' Gemma was called into action last week as Frozen character Princess Anna to put the smile back on Gracie Hewett's face. Gracie, four, spent nearly five hours in hospital on April 14 after being struck by a motorcyclist and dragged along a road. She was lucky to escape with relatively minor injuries - scraped knees, a small puncture in her cheek and scuffs to her face - but the ordeal really brought her down. Dedication:Her father drives her to her gigs, while mother Carolyn helps with costumes and music . Gemma heard about the crash and headed round to cheer up the recovering youngster at home.Mum Leah Keohan, 25, said: 'She was amazing. 'Frozen is Gracie's favourite film and she came round with loads of presents, including a tiara and a bracelet just like the ones she was wearing as well as loads of Easter eggs. 'Gracie was just in awe of her. They sat and talked for ages and then sang Let it Go together. 'I asked how much Gemma wanted and she just said ""no, it's free"". What she's doing is brilliant.' Appealing to all ages: 'These characters are relatable to adults too,' Gemma said .","Gemma Beard, 22, works in a computer games store by day .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Modern professional wrestling contains many theatrics and sometimes pre-determined outcomes. But although the lurid costumes might be new, there is now proof that ancient wrestling matches were fixed too. Historians have deciphered a delicate Greek papyrus dating from 267AD, which shows that the outcome of a wrestling match between two teenagers was predetermined. First proof of match fixing: Historians have deciphered a delicate Greek papyrus (pictured) dating from 267AD, which shows that a wrestling match between two teenagers was predetermined . Oxyrhynchus lies south west of Cairo and is considered to be one of the most important archaeological sites in Egypt. It has yielded a huge collection of papyrus texts from the Ptolemaic and Roman periods of Egyptian history and among them are fragments of plays and the Gospel of Thomas. The city was built around a system of canals and inhabitants dumped their rubbish at nearby sand hills, including lots of written material as Oxyrhynchus was governed bureaucratically by the Greeks and the Romans. Archaeologists have discovered tax returns, census material, receipts, letters about religion, politics, military action and diaries, giving them a thorough picture of everyday life. In 1896, two young excavators - Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Hunt - from the University of Oxford began to excavate the site and combed through the rubbish. While they were concerned with finding works of high literature, they realised the importance of the discarded everyday material. Some 500,000 papyrus fragments are now kept at the university's Sackler Library; among them the account of match fixing. The contract is the first proof of match-fixing ever discovered. It was made between the father of a wrestler called Nicantinous and the trainers of Demetrius who were set to wrestle in the final of the 138th 'Great Antinoeia', which was a series of games held during a religious festival in Egypt. The contract says that Demetrius must ‘when competing in the competition for the boy [wrestlers]...fall three times and yield’ and in turn he would be rewarded with ‘three thousand eight hundred drachmas of silver of old coinage.’ The ancient bribe also contains a clause that Demetrius would still get his money if the judges picked up on the fact the match was fixed and refused to grant Nicantinous victory. To make absolutely sure of a win, Nicantinous’ father arranged in the contract that if Demetrius backed out of the deal and went on to win, his trainers would have to pay a larger sum of money to his son. Dominic Rathbone, a professor at King's College London who translated the papyrus, told Live Science that 3,800 drachma - the cost of the original bribe - was not a large amount of money and could have bought a donkey. On your marks! The contract says that Demetrius the wrestler must 'when competing in the competition for the boy [wrestlers], to fall three times and yield¿ and in turn he would be rewarded with 'three thousand eight hundred drachmas of silver of old coinage.' A frieze showing Greek wrestlers is pictured . In a fair match, wrestlers fought to throw each other to the ground three times, using a number of holds and throws, some of which reportedly resembled body slams seen in modern professional wrestling. The contract was discovered in Oxyrhynchus, in Egypt - around 100miles (160km) south west of Cairo - more than a century ago and has only been recently translated, with the document kept at the Sackler library at the University of Oxford. Professor Rathbone explained that ancient people made such brides to reduce their losses as the training of athletes was expensive and there were no prizes for runners-up. An Egyptian treasure: The contract was discovered in Oxyrhynchus, in Egypt (marked by 'A' around 100miles (160km) south west of Cairo more than a century ago and has only been recently translated, with the document kept at the Sackler Library at the University of Oxford . ‘If you were confident you would win, normally you would go for it. If you're not sure you would win, maybe you're cutting your risk by saying, “At least I get the bribe,”’ Professor Rathbone said. It was not unusual for winners to be paid large amounts of money or to receive lifetime pensions. However, experts are baffled as to why a written contract was drawn up as it would have been difficult to take to court if either side backed-put of the deal. They do not think that it was specially drawn up by a scribe with legal knowledge. While the papyrus is the only known written record of match fixing in ancient times, there are references to it in accounts of the times and the practice was relatively common in the Roman Empire.","Historians deciphered a .

"By . Tom Latchem . The overnight fame that comes with joining one of Britain's most popular soaps must be hard to deal with - as EastEnders star Ben Hardy can testify. The 23-year-old, who last June became the sixth person to play Peter Beale on the show, admits he struggled to cope with the attention. 'I didn't realise the impact it would have on my life,' says Dorset-born Ben. 'The show is so popular that lots of people approach you and ask for photos. Everyone's lovely, but sometimes if you'd rather be on your own it's the last thing you want to do.' Ben Hardy, who plays Peter Beale in EastEnders, says that he found it difficult to adjust to sudden fame . In fact, Ben found it so hard to cope with fame he shut himself away in the west London home he shares with his actress girlfriend of four years Kat, also 23. 'For a while I didn't want to leave the house,' he reveals. 'Eventually I just got sick of being indoors. Now I take steps not to be noticed when I don't want to be. For instance, I live near Westfield shopping centre, so I won't go there at the weekend. 'But I guess it's just one of those things, and I'm grateful to have such support from EastEnders viewers.' Ben's profile is set to become even higher as the 'whodunnit' murder mystery of Lucy Beale grows. As Lucy's . on-screen twin he's right in the thick of it - and will even be named as . a suspect. The storyline is set to run into next year, the BBC1 . flagship soap's 30th anniversary. 'I'm . chuffed to be getting gritty stuff,' says Ben. 'I liked the love story . with Lola but it's nice to get stuck into a storyline like this. None of . the cast knows who the killer is, and everyone's talking about it. Ben says that although he enjoyed the love story between Peter and Lola (pictured), he is enjoying being part of a grittier story line on the show . 'I don't think being the killer would fit Peter's character, but I wouldn't shy away from it if that was what was decided.' Ben, who starred in West End play The Judas Kiss before joining EastEnders, admits he found the transition from stage to screen difficult. 'On stage you rehearse for five weeks and it goes out to 300 people,' he says. 'In EastEnders you get ten minutes to rehearse and seven million people watch it! After such a short rehearsal time you often feel there's more to give. It's frustrating but you just have to put it to one side and get on with your next scene. 'If I had to choose I'd say I prefer the stage, as that's what I've always done. I'd love to play a lead in the theatre.' For now though, Ben, who's up for Sexiest Male at next month's British Soap Awards ('It's flattering but it's not an accolade for acting, it's genetics!') is happy on Albert Square. 'I don't know how long I'll be in EastEnders. I'll see what happens, what storylines I get,' he says. Ben is also equally easy-going about matters of the heart - specifically whether he and Kat, who met in the same class at acting school, plan to marry. 'I fancied Kat the moment I met her. She's great and we moved in together about a year ago. Marriage? I'll see how it goes - we're both young so there's plenty of time yet.' Holidays: sun or snow? The hotter the better because I like to get a tan and it's cold all the time here. Greasy spoon or silver service? I prefer an upmarket place because I like a nice cut of steak with chips. Rum or vodka? Vodka - with lime and soda. It's good for my waistline! Sport: watching or playing? Both. I played a lot of rugby growing up and I go and watch Arsenal all the time. Music: pop or rock? I was at Justin Timberlake's London concert recently and turned into a screaming fan! Cars: vintage or modern? If I could drive any car then it would be the beautiful, old-school Ford Mustang. Brad Pitt or Joaquin Phoenix? Joaquin. I don't know how he didn't win an Oscar for The Master.","Ben Hardy shot to fame last year after being cast as Peter Beale .

"By . Bianca London . With just five days to go until the hottest fashion collaboration of the year lands (that's Kate Moss for Topshop, for anyone who's been living under a rock), the high street shopping giant are ramping up the excitement. The store has released a behind the scenes film of Kate and Arcadia boss Sir Philip Green curating the collection - and it's refreshing to see just how much input Kate has had on her eponymous range. The notoriously elusive supermodel can be seen chatting away about her inspirations and exactly what she wants from the range, while a semi-bored looking Sir Philip provides his musings. Tell me you don't love this? Sir Philip Green stars in a behind the scenes fashion video with Kate Moss ahead of her collection launch - and it appears that the Topshop boss is her biggest fan . A bubbly Kate tries on a few of her upcoming designs while providing a running commentary such as 'I love the fringing' and 'this is great for festivals'. She then does her own mini catwalk show, partakes in a few twirls and pouts in front of the mirror, while Sir Philip comments: 'That's Kate to a T' about one of the dresses before the pair share a tender hug. Close: The Arcadia boss and supermodel, who have been firm friends for many years, even share a tender hug during the fashion film, which has been launched to promote the new collection . Is someone excited? Kate, who is usually rather elusive, is bubbly, chatty and excitable in the short clip . Guess who I'm with...?! Sir Philip holds his rather vintage Nokia phone to Kate's ear during a brainstorming session . What do you think, Phil? Kate, 40, can be seen spinning around in one of her fringed waistcoats as Sir Philip provides his musings . The model's SS14 collection, which lands on April 30, is full of Seventies-style pieces, including fringed suede jackets, jump suits and maxi dresses. There are also embroidered smock-tops, silk blouses and graphic print kaftans that will go on sale in high street stores globally and online. Kate is said to have taken . inspiration from her own wardrobe, which, despite her status as a . supermodel, isn't just full of designer labels. She's also a fan of . scouring the rails of second-hand stores. A . weave waistcoat, suede shorts and a deep blue fringed jacket are all in . keeping with the Seventies vibe. The latter is said to be inspired by a . jacket the 40-year-old has worn to three Rolling Stones concerts which . she refers to as her 'gig . jacket'. As well as . channelling a vintage look, she was also keen to reflect her laidback . style. There are baggy pyjama trousers glammed up through the use satin . material in distinct prints and cool kaftans perfect for hitting the . beach in over the summer. Seventies chic: Kate models a fringed suede jacket, left, and a sparkly disco fringed dress from her new collection for Topshop . Vintage vibe: The collection includes maxi dresses for evening and day wear with many items inspired by Kate's own wardrobe . Print kaftans and blouses are a wardrobe staple for jetsetter Kate, while a girl can't have enough LBDs . For evening wear, there are sexy frilled flapper style dresses and long numbers that flash a hint of thigh. Many of the dresses are also in keeping with the vintage-feel with fringing, sequins and  crepe satin. Meanwhile there are also some tailored pieces for smart office wear including tuxes and trouser suits and summery floral printed shirts. While much of the collection will be sold at affordable prices, one dress is a more pricey Â£600. The high price tag is to reflect the handiwork that went into creating the densely hand-beaded dress. Kate first collaborated with Topshop in 2007 before taking a break to work on other projects. Party dresses: The spring/summer collection also includes day wear and tailored pieces . Lucrative partnership: Sir Philip Green is delighted Kate is back designing for the British High Street store . The mother-of-one announced last year that she would be reprising her role as a designer for the British brand. Topshop's Sir Philip Green, who counts the model as a friend, said he was delighted she decided to return to his fashion stable.He said: 'I am personally thrilled that Kate wanted to come back to Topshop to work with us again. The first time around was such a lot of fun and she has been sorely missed. The Topshop business has developed extensively around the globe since we launched with Kate in 2007.' Kate added: 'I have really missed being involved in the design process, and working with the team at Topshop. I am very excited to create a new collection that bears my name.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . You might have played popular video game, Plants Vs. Zombies, but for some shrubs it is already too late. For the first time, scientists have revealed how bacterial parasites can turn plants into the living dead. A parasitic bacterium, called phytoplasmas, hijacks the reproductive organs of a plant and sterilises it so that the plants stay alive, but only for the good of the pathogen. Scroll down for video . The living dead: The parasitic bacterium hijacks a plant's reproductive system and forced it to produce leaf-like structures (pictured bottom row) instead of flowers (top) to sterilise it so that the plant stays alive, but only for the good of the pathogen . By turning the flower into what looks like a leaf, insects called leafhoppers, which carry and spread the parasite, are attracted. This ensures that the bacteria is spread far and wide. Other parasites are known to infect and control the brains of ants and can make rats more susceptible to predation. ‘We know these parasites are puppet masters but the strings they are pulling have yet to be identified,’ said Professor Saskia Hogenhout from the John Innes Centre in Norwich. ‘For the first time, we can reveal how this remarkable manipulation takes place [in plants]. 'In that sense, the plant world is ahead of animal biology – where manipulations also take place but no mechanisms have been uncovered to show how.’ The plant parasite in her study is spread by insects that grow on plants. It induces the plant to transform its flowers into leaves, sacrificing its reproductive success and becoming sterile. It becomes a zombie plant with no prospect of reproducing and is dependent on the survival of the bacteria. Together with scientists at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, the team discovered that the parasitic bacterium produces a protein called SAP54 that is essential to this process. And the protein is dependent on a family of plant proteins called RAD23. The carrier: Infected plant parts are eaten by leafhoppers (pictured) and the bacteria then colonises the insects, including their salivary glands. If the insect dribbles saliva as it sucks on another plant, the bacteria are able to spread onto new plant tissue, where the sterilisation process begins again . The bacterium affects a broad range of plants, turning flowers green, transforming them into leaf tissue or producing a profusion of stems known as Witches' Broom. It is currently controlled by pesticides because it can also infect crops including: maize, wheat, carrots, tomatoes, potato, oilseed rape, and grapes. The scientists hope that their breakthrough could lead to new ways of controlling the bacteria by disrupting the protein without using pesticides. Infected plant parts are eaten by leafhoppers and the bacterium then colonises the insects, including their salivary glands. Feeling green: The first sign that the parasite has taken hold of a plant (a healthy version is pictured left) is that its flower petals slowly turn green (pictured right) before being transformed into a more leaf-like tissue . If the insect dribbles saliva as it sucks on another plant, the bacterium is able to spread onto new plant tissue, where it sets to work on making the plant more attractive to leafhoppers. The SAP54 and RAD23 proteins force the plant to transform its flowers into leaf-like material and become more attractive to leafhoppers. The leafhoppers pick up the bacterium from infected plants and can then spread the bacterial pathogen to more plants. Professor Hogenhout said: ‘This parasite is incapable of surviving without its insect and plant hosts and we showed that a parasite protein connects distinct processes in its host plant to manipulate both the plant and the insect. Dr Allyson MacLean, of the John Innes Centre, who is the lead author of the study, published in the journal PLOS Biology, said: ‘It is fascinating to consider that this bacterium is able to manipulate the way plants grow and the way insects behave to suit its own needs.’","After sterilisation caused by a parasite called phytoplasmas, the plants stay alive - but only for the good of the pathogen .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Battle: Alexia Rose Crane was so ill when she was 14 months old that her parents were told to say goodbye to her . The parents of a critically ill girl were told to say goodbye after she was declared medically dead for seven minutes. Alexia Rose Crane was rushed to Blackpool Victoria Hospital when she was just 14 months old. She had been unable to keep down her food and drink and her illness took a dramatic turn for the worse when she suffered a heart attack. Her parents Melissa Kimpton, 25, and Joseph Crane, 24, were with her as she was rushed by ambulance to Alder Hey Children’s Hospital in Liverpool. Doctors battled to save the toddler’s life but her devastated parents were reduced to tears after being told to say their goodbyes. Full-time mother Ms Kimpton said: 'Doctors actually told us to say goodbye to her because her condition was so critical. 'I’ve never been so frightened in all my life. I just kept asking myself why it was Alexia and not me. 'To see her lying in a hospital bed with tubes everywhere and being kept alive by a ventilator is something a mother should never have to do.' Hours after Alexia arrived at Alder Hey she was taken to the specialist children’s unit and diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy. The disease leaves the heart unable to pump blood around the body efficiently and symptoms include shortness of breath, swelling of the ankles and abdomen and excessive tiredness. The critically ill little girl was put on a ventilator as her parents, who also have an eight-year-old son Cameron, desperately waited for news. She was given several blood transfusions, kidney dialysis and an MRI scan during her time at the hospital. Against expectations, Alexia’s condition slowly improved she was allowed to come off the ventilator on Christmas Day - nine days after being admitted to hospital. Fight: During her time in hospital, Alexia (with mother, Melissa) was given several blood transfusions, kidney dialysis and an MRI scan. At one point, she was also declared medically dead for seven minutes . Hope: Thankfully, she has now started to make a recovery, defying medical expectations . Ms Kimpton described the agonising wait as the 'worst experience imaginable';. She added: 'As a mother, it was by far the worst experience imaginable to be told your daughter could die. 'She was trembling when she woke up but it was a huge relief that she was responding to the treatment. 'It certainly felt like someone was smiling down on us because we really did fear the worst after being told to say goodbye.' Praise: Alexia's grateful parents are now raising money for the local hospital that saved her life . Three months on from the harrowing experience, Alexia continues to have medication administered via a syringe three times a day while having regular hospital check-ups. The mother-of-two added: 'The whole thing was a terrifying experience for the whole family. 'Joseph and I stayed at her bedside the whole time while Cameron stayed with my mum and it feels like a miracle that she’s pulled through. 'I’m so grateful for what the hospital staff did and I’ve started a Just Giving page to raise money for Blackpool Victoria Hospital to show them how much we appreciate what they did.'

"By . Ray Massey . Bentley is going ‘green’ by switching its luxury cars to ‘plug-in’ electric hybrid power within two years. And by the end of the decade nine out of 10 of the sporty British cars will have the option of charging up from the mains to improve their fuel efficiency and reduce their high CO2 emissions by up to 70 per cent. It means the luxury leviathans could soon have emissions as low as a standard Ford Fiesta hatchback. New design: Bentley will switch its luxury cars to 'plug-in' electric hybrid power . Engine: The hybrid system will offer a power increase of up to 25 per cent together with a 70 per cent reduction in CO2 emissions . Power-up: The cars, which currently fail to average 17 miles to the gallon, will be more fuel efficient with the electric chargers . The luxury car-maker is harnessing the technology now familiar to motorists since the launch of Toyota’s petrol-electric Prius, to make even its biggest and most expensive limousines more frugal and green. t will match its conventional petrol engines to an on-board electric motor which can be charged from the mains, but also use electric power generated from braking . Bentley bosses at Crewe say that after a full charge, their ‘plug-in’ hybrids will be able to run on electric power alone for up to 30 miles. It also means that cars which now fail to average 17 miles to the gallon will go many miles further per fill-up. Stylish: Bentley says its new £110,000 sports utility vehicle will be 'the most luxurious and powerful sports utility vehicle on the market' Decor: The Carbon-efficient model will have the same lavish interior as the model it is based on, the Mulsanne . Gearstick: The model, which uses a manual gearbox, will be able to travel for 30 miles on electricity alone . Bentley is to showcase its new technology at the Beijing International Automotive Exhibition in China on Sunday using a prototype electric hybrid Bentley Mulsanne. Bentley says it will boost performance and efficiency without compromising luxury. But the first production car in which electric power will feature is the firm’s new 4X4 sports utility vehicle to be launched in 2017. Bentley says its new £110,000 sports utility vehicle will be ‘the most luxurious and powerful sports utility vehicle on the market’ and expects to sell 3,000 a year. It will be followed by a new ‘baby’ Bentley, the fifth model in the range. Grill: Bentley claims the new design will boost performance and efficiency without comprising looks and luxury . Wheels: The same 4X4 technology used in the non-hybrid models will be adapted and installed on the car . A Bentley spokesman said: ‘The plug-in hybrid system will offer a power increase of up to 25per cent together with a 70per cent reduction in CO2 emissions, both without any compromise to the exquisite luxury, timeless design and industry-leading refinement for which Bentley has become renowned. ‘Bentley hybrids will also be capable of driving at least 30miles on electric power alone, allowing for emissions-free city driving with the option of enhanced performance on the open road. ‘ . The Bentley hybrid prototype is based on the flagship £230,000 Mulsanne. The current model has a 6.75 litre V8 petrol engine developing which propels it from rest to 60mph in just 5.1 seconds up to a top speed of 184mph. Acceleration: It will be able to reach speeds of up to 184mph and will reach 60mph in just 5.1 seconds . But on fuel efficiency it manages just a gas-guzzling 16.7 miles to gallon with whopping CO2 emissions of 393grammes per kilometre. If an electric hybrid version achieved the promised 70 per cent reduction in C02 emissions, this would take it down to around 118g/km – or about the same as a standard 1.25 litre Ford Fiesta or an Audi A1 hatchback. The more frugal ECOboost Ford Fiesta manages 99g/km. Bentley has already announced 100 new jobs and record profits of £140million after revealing it will be exporting its powerful engines abroad for the first time in its history – including to Germany – from next year. Bentley, which is part of the giant Volkswagen Group, is to become a ‘centre of excellence’ for all large 12-cylinder W12 engine production which will be exported for use in other cars in the VW conglomerate – including Volkswagens and Audis - from the end of next year. Bentley Motors’ headquarters in Crewe is home to all of its operations including design, research and development, engineering and production of the company’s three model lines, Continental, Flying Spur and Mulsanne.

"By . Tim Oglethorpe . Vera, the TV detective, has always been good at collaring her man, but not so efficient at finding one for herself. The first three series of the popular ITV drama have been all about her police work rather than her private life, but as the fourth series gets underway, Brenda Blethyn, who plays her, suggests that may be about to change. 'Watch this space,' she teases. 'My feeling is that Vera had romantic attachments in the past... and she may do again in the future. I know the public would like her to become romantically involved. I get letters from all over the world suggesting it. ""Bellissima Vera,"" they write. ""Why she no boyfriend, she lovely!""' Brenda says that the fourth series of Vera might see a more personal side to the detective . Brenda herself has been with her partner Michael Mayhew, the former head of graphic design at the National Theatre, for three decades and they married in June 2010. They've obviously cracked it as far as compatibility is concerned, but Brenda isn't about to go all mushy when she reveals their secret to domestic bliss. 'I think it helps that I'm up in Northumberland half the time filming Vera, so long may it continue,' she laughs. 'But seriously, I genuinely think it's about having our own space. We have a place on the coast in my hometown of Ramsgate in Kent, and even when we're there we sit in separate rooms, Michael with his music in one, me with my crossword in another. We have so little in common but the relationship obviously works. Michael makes me laugh like nobody else does, and I think he likes me for my honesty and my kindness. 'Although the honesty can irritate him. I've sometimes come home from auditions and told him I've recommended somebody else for the role rather than me, and that really gets on his nerves. ""Why do you always put yourself second Brenda?"" he says. ""Why do you talk about who else would be good for the part, rather than you? Don't do that!"" Brenda receives fan mail asking why Vera hasn't got a romantic partner . 'But I can't help it and I don't think it's damaged my career. I couldn't have wanted the part that much if I were recommending somebody else, and if I were thinking about a particular person for the role the chances are the producers were too. 'But I have an urge to be honest, whatever the situation. I'm trying to sell my home in south London at the moment, and I know I'd have to tell any potential buyer all its little flaws, and Michael knows I would too. No wonder the estate agent doesn't want me around while he's showing people the house.' Brenda, 68, is refreshingly honest about pretty much everything. When she says she never wanted children, for example, you absolutely believe her. 'Once in a blue moon I've wished I had but it's been so fleeting that it's not been a bother to me. The things I wish I had done I've done, wherever possible. I wanted to run a marathon so I did the London one in 2002, 2003 and 2004 and was really pleased with myself, although I thought I might be brought home in a box! But I had to do it even though I was never the quickest. The person next to me on the starting line one year, a gentleman of 93, was quicker than me! 'Now my aim is to learn a foreign language because one of the greatest regrets in my life has been not doing that. I studied French for a movie I did called London River about five years ago. I went on a crash course for three weeks but then I forgot it all, so now I'm taking French lessons again whenever I go down to Ramsgate. I'm determined to crack it.' Comparisons between Brenda and Vera are not easy to find. The actress is far more glamorous than her alter ego. Slim and glowing, Brenda arrives for our meeting in a black chiffon blouse and a cream trouser suit, topped off with stylishly coiffed copper-coloured hair, while Vera's happy to waddle around in several layers of unflattering clothing and a green fisherman's hat. When asked at a wedding recently why Vera's so frumpy, Brenda replied, 'Because that's the way she's written in Ann Cleeves' original books. Making her glamorous would be like making Hannibal Lecter a vegetarian.' It is Brenda's total dedication to a role that led her to two Oscar nominations, for her performances in Secrets & Lies in 1996 and Little Voice two years later. And she takes Vera, which regularly attracts more than 6 million viewers, just as seriously. Brenda says that her character Vera is so frumpy because that is how she is written in the novel . While she's up in the north-east filming for months on end Brenda immerses herself in local life to give herself a better understanding of Vera's Geordie culture. 'I love it when people feel they own Vera,' she says. 'When they know we're filming in the area they come out of their homes with tables and chairs and watch us, offering us cups of tea and cakes and occasionally glasses of wine. I love the fact that people want to be close to the show and that they like it so much and pay me compliments when they see me around Newcastle. 'And I do whatever I can to make it successful. I made the mistake of losing Vera's distinctive hat a while ago, and although I found it again I made sure there'd never be an occasion where Vera was potentially hatless again. I tracked down the same hat to a fishing shop in Newcastle and bought one, and then I ordered four more like it online.' 'Making Vera glamorous would be like making Hannibal Lecter a vegetarian.' One of nine children, Brenda - born Brenda Bottle - had a poor but happy upbringing, and remains refreshingly down-to-earth despite being one of our most in-demand actresses. 'To be good at what I do means everything,' she says. 'I'm a working-class girl and I'm really happy when the producers and directors are happy with what I'm doing on Vera. I'd find failing at my job embarrassing and humiliating, and I know Vera would too. She's been known to bend the rules, but she always tries to do the right thing and always knows what the right thing to do is. I'm not sure people necessarily know what the right thing to do is any more, or are even allowed to do it in our society. 'When I was growing up we were all taught you shouldn't answer a policeman back, that there were consequences if you weren't considerate or stole something. Now you get several chances before you even get reprimanded. 'Things started to change when discipline was taken away from parents and teachers. I don't condone corporal punishment and I know laws were brought in because children were being abused. But have the abusers stopped? I doubt it. And parents and teachers who would have disciplined their children aren't allowed to do it any more. Something's gone wrong with society and it needs to change. And probably quite fast.'

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A mother who lost a fifth of the skin on her legs to meningitis has urged others to be aware of symptoms of the disease. Michelle Atkinson, 37, thought she was suffering from flu when she contracted a fever and began to feel dizzy at work. But when she woke up the next day unable to move her legs she quickly realised her condition was a lot more serious and she was rushed to hospital. Michelle Atkinson, 37, suffered severe skin damage when she developed meningitis . Doctors swiftly diagnosed her with an aggressive form of meningitis and she was placed in an induced coma to keep her alive. As a result of the disease, the hospital worker lost a fifth of the skin on her legs and parts of her toes. Ms Atkinson, from Bedminster, Bristol, has now spoken out to warn others it is not just children and teenagers who can be affected by the deadly illness. She said before she developed meningitis and septicaemia she thought the infection was only contracted by youngsters. Ms Atkinson also lost a fifth of the skin on her legs, most of her toes and had to spend three months in hospital recovering from the illness . 'I had gone . home from work feeling quite unwell but I didn’t think it was anything . serious. I had a fever and felt quite dizzy,' she said. 'By . the next day it had got a lot worse. I couldn’t move my legs, that’s . when I realised it was probably a lot more serious so I called an . ambulance. 'I felt really embarrassed calling 999 because I worked at the infirmary and I didn’t want people thinking I was overreacting. I don’t remember much after that.' Source: NHS Choices . Following the incident a year ago, she woke up in the burns unit at Frenchay Hospital, Bristol. Doctors told her 20 per cent of the skin . on her legs had burned away as a result of the disease, and parts of her . toes had also fallen off. Ms Atkinson lost part of her skin because she also developed septicaemia. The Meningitis Research Foundation says when the bacteria that cause meningitis and septicaemia invade the bloodstream they produce toxins that attack the lining of the blood vessels so they start to leak. This leakage of blood means that there is not enough blood to carry oxygen to all parts of the body. At the same time, the toxins cause blood clots to form in the tiny blood vessels in the skin, making it even harder for blood to reach all parts of the body. To maintain circulation to the vital organs, the circulatory system reduces the blood supply to the extremities such as the hands, feet and the surface of the skin. When skin loses blood supply, it is starved of oxygen and vital nutrients, and patches of it die off and blacken. This most often happens to tissue on the fingers, hands, toes and feet because the blood has further to travel to reach these areas. Ms Atkinson (pictured with her daughter, Kira) was diagnosed with meningitis after developing a fever and dizziness and waking up to find she could not move her legs . In extreme cases this can lead to the loss of fingers and toes and sometimes limbs or parts of limbs may need to be amputated. Throughout her traumatic three months in hospital Meningitis Now, a charity set up to support victims of the disease, helped Ms Atkinson in a variety of ways. She said: 'They were always there to talk to. They checked up on me. 'It can be quite a lonely thing being in hospital. 'A lot of things were happening to my body as well. 'It was so nice to have someone to explain it all to me and for me to talk to even after I left hospital.' Ms Atkinson now wants to raise awareness about the symptoms of meningitis. These include a high fever, a headache, neck stiffness, an aversion to bright light and a red rash that does not disappear under pressure.","Michelle Atkinson went home from work feeling dizzy and feverish .

"By . Lucy Worsley . Are you under the impression that Henry VIII was the most dysfunctional monarch we've ever had? Meeting our Hanoverian kings of the 18th century might make you think again. We'll be hearing a lot about them in 2014, as our first Hanoverian monarch George I - distant forebear of today's little Prince George - ascended the throne exactly 300 years ago. George I ascended the throne exactly 300 years ago . Exhibitions across London are celebrating this anniversary, including The First Georgians: Art & Monarchy 1714-1760 at The Queen's Gallery, Buckingham Palace, with over 300 Georgian treasures from the Royal Collection. At Historic Royal Palaces, where I am a curator, we're covering the stories of George I at Hampton Court and George II at Kensington Palace. I'll also be introducing George I and George II, Britain's least-known kings, in a new BBC 4 series The First Georgians. It's funny to think that our modern British monarchy originated in Germany, and that Georg Ludwig, Elector of Hanover (effectively a prince), was invited to become King George I of Great Britain through an accident of biology. In 1714 his distant cousin Queen Anne died with no surviving children, despite having gone through 18 pregnancies trying to produce an heir. Her nearest relatives were all Catholic, and therefore unacceptable to Britain's powerful Protestant ruling class. George II (left) and his son George III (right) who both were said to have volatile relationships with their family . So Parliament looked for Anne's nearest surviving Protestant relatives and finally found them living in the sleepy little German state of Hanover. German Georg was then 54 years old, and wasn't all that keen on coming over to Britain to start a new career as king. He wasn't warmly welcomed by his new subjects either. One spectator at his Coronation waved a turnip on a stick: the message was that Hanover was a place full of yokels. His new subjects also believed he had brought with him no fewer than two mistresses - one fat, one thin - known as The Elephant and The Maypole. 'The king rejects no woman if she is very willing, very fat, and has great breasts,' one courtier claimed. In reality, the king's poor English was at the root of the misunderstanding. The Elephant was really his half-sister and he lived with his single, skinny, almost respectable mistress of more than 20 years Melusine, with whom he had three illegitimate daughters. But there was a fiery sexual scandal in King George's past. In the 1690s, his wife, Sophia Dorothea of Celle, had embarked upon an affair with a Swedish count while George consorted with Melusine. George IV (pictured) tried to carry out a coup and become king in his father's place . Their love letters were leaked and George was humiliated throughout Europe. Rumour has it he had the lover assassinated, and it's absolutely certain he divorced his wife for adultery, placing her under house arrest in a remote German castle for the rest of her life. At the time George I locked up his wife, their son, the future George II, was only 11. He would never see his mother again. This was one factor in the appallingly bad relationship that developed between these two. George I was quiet and shy, whereas George II was volatile and passionate. George I had hated his wife, while George II loved his own deeply. The parties George I held at Kensington Palace were rivalled by the exciting soirÃ©es hosted elsewhere by his son. At the Prince of Wales's parties, people were said to have had so much fun 'some virgins conceived'. This bad feeling came to a head in the ludicrous events of 1717, known as 'The Christening Quarrel'. When the Prince of Wales and his wife Caroline had their fifth child, the baby's christening was interrupted by a gate-crasher, the Duke of Newcastle, who'd been sent by the king to be a spy in his son's camp. 'You rascal!' the Prince of Wales said to the Duke, 'I will find you later!' Unfortunately, because all the Hanoverians spoke English with a thick German accent, what the courtier heard was, 'You rascal!  I will fight you!' He took this as an invitation to a duel - a dreadful breach of court etiquette - and complained to the king, who, believing the worst, expelled his son and Princess Caroline from the royal palaces. He also kept behind four of his grandchildren as hostages for future good behaviour from their father the Prince of Wales. Poor Princess Caroline 'fell into one faint after another' as she said goodbye to her weeping children. Worse still, the new baby boy, whose christening had ignited the quarrel, was given poor medical care, and died. Accounts in the National Archives record payment for a little square of black velvet, the size of a child's coffin. This quarrel dangerously tarnished the image of the new Royal Family. And yet the alternative was seen as even worse. Few people wanted the Catholic Stuart claimants to the throne back again: the Old Pretender James Stuart, and then his son, the Young Pretender Bonnie Prince Charlie. Slowly but surely, with growing confidence, kings George I and then George II settled into their new realm, providing steady government, and crushing two rebellions by their exiled rivals. Historian, Dr Lucy Worsley, will present The First Georgians starting on Thursday, 9pm on BBC4 . George I's great-grandson, George III, completed the process of transplantation when he came to the throne in 1760. 'I was born and educated in this country,' he proudly declared, 'I glory in the name of Britain.' A kind and welcoming man, he came to the throne resolved 'to introduce a new custom': that all his 'family should live well together', because he was 'very sorry for the misunderstandings that there had formerly been'. He proceeded to act on this by marrying a German princess, Charlotte, remaining uxoriously devoted to her and fathering 15 children. Yet one thing remained the same.  As the years rolled by, even the friendly George III came to have a terrible relationship with his own eldest son, the future George IV. When the king began to suffer from debilitating bouts of a mysterious illness, possibly porphyria, or maybe bipolar disorder, his son tried to carry out a coup and become king in his father's place. Today, many people have difficulty identifying the four Georgian monarchs, thinking them grumpy, German and indistinguishable. But in reality they were human beings, experiencing pain and passion just as the rest of us do. This year's exhibitions and programmes about the Hanoverian kings will hopefully bring them back to vivid life. The First Georgians, Thursday, 9pm, BBC4. The First Georgians: Art & Monarchy 1714-1760 is showing at The Queen's Gallery until 12 October.","A new series will explore the lives of British Hanoverian monarchs .

These images show the aftermath of the high-speed crash, which took place near to Woolley Edge services in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. The front of the Ferrari 458 Italia is almost destroyed in the images, while the bonnet sticks up in the air. Smash: A driver was left uninjured when he smashed his Ferrari 458 into the central reservation on the M1 . Damage: The car's bumper was smashed following the collision near Wakefield, West Yorkshire, on Monday . Luckily, the rest of the car - prices for which start at around £170,000, appears relatively unscathed. Fortunately, the driver was not injured in the crash - which took place at around 3.45pm on Monday. No one else was harmed in the crash either, police confirmed. Officers took to Twitter after the collision to issue road safety advice after the car careered into the barrier on the northbound carriageway. The West Yorkshire Road Policing Unit tweeted: 'Ferrari RTC into the central reservation! Bad weather conditions be careful.' Warning: West Yorkshire Police road unit tweeted this picture of the crash - taking the opportunity to warn drivers about poor driving conditions due to bad weather . Hot wheels: Officers then commented on the £170,000 vehicle - saying it was a 'very nice car' Production of the Ferrari 458 began in 2009. It is rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive . There are two different body types: Berlinetta and Spider . Engine: 4.5L V8 (562 hp at 9,000 rpm) Transmission: 7-speed dual-clutch . Acceleration: 0-100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.3 seconds . Top speed: 325 km/h (202 mph) Price: Begins at £169,545 . They later added: 'It was a very nice car.' The Ferrari's 0-60mph acceleration is 3.3 seconds with a top speed of 202 mph. It is powered by a 4.5L V8 engine which produces 562 hp at 9,000 rpm. Last week, another Ferrari was in the spotlight for a very different reason - because its owner had wrapped it in £4,000 work of gold vinyl. The £200,000 248 Spider belonged to kickboxing world champion Riyadh Al-Azzawi. Mr Al-Azzawi parked the Italian supercar outside a gym in Kensington, London, where he was training. It wasn't long before it attracted crowds of gawping onlookers - some of which even took videos of the rather garish vehicle.","Ferrari 458 Italia smashed into central reservation of M1 on Monday .

"By . Mark Prigg . Astronomers have spotted a giant river of hydrogen in space - and say it could be what gives spiral galaxies their ability to keep spewing out stars. They say it could give an unprecedented insight into how galaxies like our own Milky Way form new stars - and why some are far more productive than others. The groundbreaking discovery helps explain the mystery that had baffled astronomers. The bright star-filled central region of galaxy NGC 6946 is shown in blue, while the dense hydrogen tracing out the galaxy's sweeping spiral arms and galactic halo is orange, and the extremely diffuse and extended 'river' of hydrogen engulfing NGC 6946 and its companions is red . The very faint, very tenuous filament of gas is streaming into the nearby galaxy NGC 6946 . NGC 6946 is located approximately 22 million light-years from Earth on the border of the constellations Cepheus and Cygnus. It is an active galaxy, though less-so than more extreme starburst galaxies, researchers said. 'We knew that the fuel for star formation had to come from somewhere,' said astronomer D.J. Pisano from West Virginia University. 'So far, however, we’ve detected only about 10 percent of what would be necessary to explain what we observe in many galaxies.' 'A leading theory is that rivers of hydrogen – known as cold flows – may be ferrying hydrogen through intergalactic space, clandestinely fueling star formation. But this tenuous hydrogen has been simply too diffuse to detect, until now.' Using the National Science Foundation’s Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT), D.J. Pisano from West Virginia University has discovered what could be a never-before-seen river of hydrogen flowing through space. The very faint, very tenuous filament of gas is streaming into the nearby galaxy NGC 6946. Spiral galaxies, like our own Milky Way, typically maintain a rather tranquil but steady pace of star formation. Others, like NGC 6946, which is located approximately 22 million light-years from Earth on the border of the constellations Cepheus and Cygnus, are much more active, though less-so than more extreme starburst galaxies. This raised the question of what is fueling the sustained star formation in this and similar spiral galaxies. Messier 101, the gigantic Pinwheel galaxy, one of the best known examples of grand design spirals. researchers believer the new hydrogen river discovery could explain why spirals continue to produce stars. Using the GBT, Pisano was able to detect the glow emitted by neutral hydrogen gas connecting NGC 6946 with its cosmic neighbors. This signal was simply below the detection threshold of other telescopes. The GBT’s unique capabilities, including its immense single dish, unblocked aperture, and location in the National Radio Quiet Zone, enabled it to detect this tenuous radio light. Astronomers have long theorized that larger galaxies could receive a constant influx of cold hydrogen by syphoning it off other less-massive companions. In looking at NGC 6946, the GBT detected just the sort of filamentary structure that would be present in a cold flow, though there is another probable explanation for what has been observed. It’s also possible that sometime in the past this galaxy had a close encounter and passed by its neighbors, leaving a ribbon of neutral atomic hydrogen in its wake. If that were the case, however, there should be a small but observable population of stars in the filaments. Further studies will help to confirm the nature of this observation and could shine light on the possible role that cold flows play in the evolution of galaxies.","Unprecedented insight into how galaxies like our own Milky Way form new stars .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Christmas might be over but jet-set celebrities and high-flying executives can order the ultimate new toy - a private supersonic jet. The aircraft claims to be the 'first supersonic business jet' and promises to cut flight times in half so that busy billionaires will be able to travel from New York to London in just three hours. However, such convenience and speed comes at a price, as the jet will cost between $60million and $80million (£36.3million and £48.4million). Scroll down for video . The S-512 aircraft claims to be the 'first supersonic business jet' and promises to cut flight times in half so that busy billionaires will be able to travel from New York to London in just three hours . Created by a team of Boston-based engineers, the Spike Aerospace S-512 aims to be the ultimate business aircraft that can reach Mach 1.6 with a top speed of 1,100mph. The engineers, who have previously worked for aerospace giants such as Airbus, Gulfstream and Bombardier, have spent the past two years designing the luxury aircraft and believe the jet will be capable of flying between New York and London in three hours. LA to Tokyo will take just five hours and London to Mumbai, four hours, according to the firm. ‘It will save passengers time so they can explore more of the world,' the company said. 'Wouldn’t you love to go hiking in New Zealand for the weekend, or fly to Paris for lunch? Created by a team of Boston-based engineers, the Spike Aerospace S-512 aims to be the ultimate business aircraft that can reach speeds of 1,100mph, or Mach 1.6 . ‘The supersonic jet will let you do more, faster,’ it added. The jet, which is designed to carry between 12 and 18 passengers in the lap of luxury, is intended to take off in December 2018. However, despite impressive engineering, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has banned supersonic flight over the U.S. making popular flights such as LA to New York unlikely in the near future. Companies including Nasa and Boeing are currently trying to develop supersonic aircraft of their own to reduce the noise - or boom - that the jets make when breaking the sound barrier. The jet is scheduled to take off in December 2018, and will cost between $60million and $80million or £36.3million to £48.4million . Vik Kachoria, President and CEO of Spike Aerospace, wrote in a blog that Elon Musk, founder of Tesla Motors and SpaceX, told a New York times Dealbook conference that 'there’s an interesting opportunity to create a supersonic, electric, vertical take-off and landing jet.' ‘It seems unlikely to come from Boeing or Airbus, given that they seem to be focused on very incremental improvements to their planes as opposed to radical improvements. So it could come from a start-up. ‘If I were to have another company in the future, which would not be any time soon, I think that would be the thing do,’ he added. Mr Kachoria said aspirations of vertical take-off and landing might be ‘a stretch’ for the first iteration of a new supersonic aircraft.

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated Press Reporter . Additional details have emerged about the Pennsylvania boy accused of stabbing 21 people at Franklin Regional High School earlier this month. Alex Hribal, 16, is revealed to have written a note saying he couldn't wait to see the 'helpless looks' on students' faces when they realize 'their precious lives are going to be taken' and that he fought off students who tried to stop him. 'No, I am not dropping them (knives), my work is not done I have more people to kill,' Hribal was overheard saying by Vice Principal Samuel King, according to an affidavit cited by KDKA. Horror: Alex Hribal wrote a note boasting of his planned kill spree, investigators said . Police say the note was found in Alex Hribal's locker. They say it was dated April 6, three days before the rampage at the school near Pittsburgh. Details about the note are contained in the criminal complaint filed Friday against Hribal that increases the number of attempted homicide charges he faces to 21, up from four. 'I can't wait to see the priceless and helpless looks on the faces of the students of one of the 'best schools in Pennsylvania' realize their precious lives are going to be taken by the only one among them that is a plebeian,' the note said, according to the affidavit. Investigators also confirmed they believe Hribal was targeting specific students, and even called one the night before the stabbing spree and said he would 'f**k them up.' No motive has yet been provided by authorities in the April 6 attack that reportedly saw Hribal run through the school wielding two eight-inch kitchen knives. The horrific rampage left 20 students and a security guard either stabbed or slashed. One student reportedly almost died after one of the knives missed his heart by by only fractions of an inch. Two of the wounded students remain hospitalized.","Alex Hribal, 16, stands charged with 21 counts of attempted homicide .

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . New Scotland Yard, the famous headquarters of the Metropolitan Police, is set to be sold off in a radical £500 million cost-cutting plan, it was announced today. The force is planning to move its HQ - one of London’s best-known landmarks - to a new smaller site on the Embankment. The plan is part of a drive to axe dozens of police stations and buildings across London and save the force millions of pounds a year. Landmark: The sale of the 1960s building could raise as much as £150million for the cash-strapped Met . Estate agents say the sale of the building - a 1960s office block in the heart of London - could raise £150 million for the cash strapped force. The block, surrounded by concrete blast barriers to protect it from terrorist attack, has been home to the Met since 1967 and is famous for its revolving sign. Senior officers say if the move goes ahead the sign will be brought to the new building. The Met is planning to move the HQ to the Curtis Green building on the Embankment,  the former HQ of Territorial Policing and once the site of Canon Row police station. The site is located just yards from the Ministry of Defence and Downing Street and was due to be sold until just months ago. A property company had agreed to pay £30 million for the site but the Met pulled out at the last minute. Insiders say the deal was called off because of security concerns around its proximity to Downing Street and Whitehall. Police say the present 20-storey building in Victoria costs £11m a year to run and needs £50 million in maintenance in the next few years. Cost-cutting: The building has been home to the Metropolitan Police since 1967 . The force’s senior command is based in the building as are a number of the Yard's most secretive and elite squads, including the Counter Terrorist Command. However, under the new plans the HQ will be drastically stripped down and operational squads will be moved out. The new building can house just 600 or so people compared to the 3,000 or so who currently work in New Scotland Yard. The Metropolitan Police Authority, the Met’s former controlling body, bought the freehold for the 1960s building in 2008. Deputy Commissioner Craig Mackey said the headquarters in the heart of the capital was an 'expensive luxury', and that it would cost £50million to bring the 1967 building up to scratch. He told the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime that the force hopes to save around £6.5million per year by moving to a smaller HQ. 'It's an expensive building to run and it's an expensive building to maintain and as we go through this change programme it's going to have space in it that we don't need. 'In central London that's an expensive luxury,' he said. The force paid £124.5 million for the building in 2008 and it costs £11 million per year to run. 'It's an expensive building to run and it's an expensive building to maintain' Met Deputy Commissioner Craig Mackey . It is expected that the move will take around two years once approvals are in place. Senior officers have drawn up plans to meet Government spending cuts of £500 million in the Met’s annual £3.6 billion budget by the year 2015. John Tully, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, likened the sale of New Scotland Yard to losing the Crown Jewels. 'It's very regrettable that it's come to this,' he said. 'Clearly it's a building of age and it's got upkeep costs, but the old police authority and now Mopac have had a consistent policy of selling off property and they've now reached the Crown Jewels. 'An iconic building like New Scotland Yard is going to bite the dust. 'The Mayor needs to look at his own office. He sits in a brand new building on the South Bank - why doesn't he sell that to save money? Thousands of people work at New Scotland Yard and it seems to me that there will be a lot of incremental costs to relocate people.' He said there had already been significant investment to refurbish the building, and the sale would be another knock to officers' morale. While Met bosses have stressed that, despite the cuts, there will be more constables in the capital than ever - 25,000 - Mr Tully said numbers of more senior ranks will be reduced.He said: 'The Mayor has pledged to maintain numbers at about 32,000 but you balance that against cuts, for example 20 per cent budget cuts, then something has got to give and it's going to be sergeants and above, right to the top. 'We have grave concerns around the supervisory ranks that we represent - sergeant, inspector and chief inspector. 'The people who are left are going to be severely challenged, because, to be frank, some of them can't do all of their job now. There are only so many hours in the day. 'The people who we represent have been working their socks off, especially during the last 18 months, and then they have been told that they've got to do more and better and smarter. It's a bit of a kick in the teeth,' Mr Tully said. Headquarters: The office block in Westminster currently houses some 3,000 staff . Police also plan to close and sell . off dozens of London police stations - many of them older Victorian . buildings - in an effort to save £60 million a year in running costs. Recent stations approved for sale include South Norwood, Richmond, Highbury Vale, Walthamstow and Willesden Green. However senior officers are pledging to open three new 'access points' or front counters for every station they shut. These could be desks in community centres or supermarkets which would be open to the public at set times of the day. The Met and the Mayor are committed to keeping at least one station per borough which is open round the clock. The cost-cutting drive will also see a shake-up in the Met’s Safer Neighbourhood teams which could see smaller boroughs merged under joint management teams. Some boroughs will share management and support functions and be run in clusters by a single commander. Former HQ: The Metropolitan Police force used to be based in the Gothic Norman Shaw buildings on the Embankment . Police plan to cut the number of senior officers in the force - while increasing the number of constables by 1,000 to a total of 25,000. They also want to move 2,000 officers from back room roles onto the streets. Senior officers want to keep the Met’s total strength at around 32,000.Deputy Commissioner Craig Mackey said : 'We want to have a greater presence in London’s communities and re-locate our officers in popular locations. 'Our objective is to make sure that that under-used front counters are replaced by at least three new front counters if they are closed. 'We want to end up in places that are most accessible to Londoners,' he added. Assistant Commissioner for territorial policing Simon Byrne said: 'There is a great variance across London in terms of the footfall in public counters. 'Our busiest gets around 100 visitors per day, our quietest on a good day gets two. 'Going forward with the financial pressures we face, it can't make economic sense to keep a building open on the off-chance that someone might pop in a couple of times per week.' The cost of the counters varies from £70 per visit down to around £10 per visit, he said. 1829 - The Metropolitan Police force is created by Sir Robert Peel. The nickname 'bobbies' derives from his name. The first headquarters are named Scotland Yard after a street in London's Whitehall. 1842 - Scotland Yard forms a detective department and plainclothes detectives are sent out for the first time. 1884 - A bomb planted by the Fenians, an Irish republican movement, explodes at Scotland Yard. It leaves a hole in the wall and damages The Rising Sun, a neighbouring pub. 1887 - The Met headquarters expands into several neighbouring addresses, including several stables. 1888 - During the construction, workers discover a dismembered female torso. The case became known as the Whitehall Mystery and has never been solved. 1890 - New headquarters at the Norman Shaw Building on the Embankment are opened and called New Scotland Yard. 1967 - The headquarters are moved from the Norman Shaw Building to a new site in Victoria Street. They keep the name of New Scotland Yard. 1968 - The famous rotating sign, which performs more than 14,000 revolutions every day, is installed outside the main doors of the building. 2012: The . force announces New Scotland Yard is to be sold off as part of a . cost-cutting drive and the Met moved to a new headquarters on the .

"By . Arthur Martin . His family and supporters continue to insist Mark Duggan was a ‘peaceful’ family man who abhorred violence. But this photograph suggests his links with the criminal underworld were far deeper than first thought. Staring menacingly into the camera, the gangster poses with his arms around two dangerous criminals who are each serving long sentences for murder and attempted murder. As one police source said: ‘He lived by the gun.’ Scroll down for videos . Gangster rap: Mark Duggan with Junior Cameron, left, and Darrell Albert, who are serving life for murder and attempted murder . And during the four-month inquest into his death, a torrent of evidence revealed the 29-year-old was one of the most violent gangsters in Europe – and linked to ten shootings and two murders. He was a senior member of North London’s notorious Tottenham ManDem gang, which traded in violence, intimidation and drugs. In the eight years before his death, Duggan was repeatedly arrested over a raft of serious crimes, including murder, attempted murder and a range of firearms offences. Duggan was repeatedly arrested over a raft of serious crimes, including murder, attempted murder and a range of firearms offences . Despite this, his mother Pamela, 55, maintains he was a ‘lovely young boy’ who tried to keep peace. Last night she refused to accept the jury’s verdict, claiming he was a peacemaker, was not in a gang and was no danger to the public. It is a picture put forward by Duggan’s family and supporters ever since England burned during days of widespread disorder in the summer of 2011. Back then, few knew of his association with some of the most feared criminals in Europe. To Duggan’s right in the picture is Junior Cameron, a career criminal serving a life sentence for shooting a man after a minor prang between their cars. Cameron pulled a semi-automatic pistol on Gary Guthrie in Streatham, South London, and shot him in the back as he tried to escape. The 39-year-old died in hospital. Cameron committed the murder in October 2007 – six months after being freed early from prison. The man to Duggan’s left is Darrell Albert, who was in the same car as Cameron that night. During the confrontation he shot Mr Guthrie’s friend Rowan Williams with a Baikal 9mm pistol – now the weapon of choice for gangsters. Mr Williams, 37, took a bullet in the neck but it was removed by surgeons and he survived. As for Duggan, he was arrested on suspicion of murder in October 2003 after a body was found next to a ditch in Tottenham. Gavin Smith, 28, had been abducted by a gang and then knifed in the back 17 times. He died from multiple stab wounds that pierced his lungs. Duggan was released without charge. Three years later, he was arrested for the attempted murder of Surkhan Hussein, a Turkish mechanic who lost a kidney after being shot. Duggan is said to have become paranoid about his own safety and carried a gun for protectio . Two of Duggan’s associates were convicted but he walked free after a witness failed to pick him out on an identity parade. The gangster was said to have shot a reveller in a crowded nightclub in Christmas 2010, and fired shots in a car park outside a club in February the following year. Again, he avoided court. Jurors heard there were a number of ‘assaults, shootings and murders’ after TMD reignited a historical feud with the London Fields Gang. TMD had a history of robbing rival drug dealers and turning up at nightclubs with guns. But the wall of silence on the Broadwater Farm Estate in Tottenham, where Duggan lived, meant many murders and shootings remain unsolved. Last night one senior Met detective told the Mail: ‘Duggan was a constant feature of briefings about the most dangerous gang members for months before his death. ‘There were regular intelligence reports of him having a gun, moving guns and the latest beefs he had with his rivals and supposed friends. ‘We were desperate to catch him red-handed and get him off the streets. Carole Duggan, aunt of Mark Duggan, makes a defiant gesture after the jury's conclusion about her nephew's death . ‘But the problem was very few people . would talk to us because he did enjoy a perverse celebrity status in the . circles he moved in. ‘Also, he lived such a chaotic life that it was difficult to keep track of where he was at any given time.’ Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, 31, who gave Duggan a gun shortly before he was shot, said he was attacked by a gang including Duggan before his death. When asked about Duggan’s killing during a police interview, he said: ‘They say karma is a bitch. They say you live by the gun and die by the bullet.’ Duggan, one of three brothers, was brought up on the Broadwater Farm Estate largely by his mother. He is said to have had a difficult childhood and witnessed violence from a young age. One of his teachers at Broadwater Farm Primary School remembered how he was one of the ‘most disruptive children in the school’. Boyan Yordanov, 47, said: ‘All kids, both the well behaved and the naughty ones, were frightened of him. Pam Duggan, mother of Mark Duggan (left) and Carole Duggan (right) outside The Royal Courts of Justice . ‘They never knew when they would be . attacked by Mark. Sadly at this young age, he had become the epitome of . aggression, as if there was nothing positive in this life for him. ‘His . attacks were sudden, unpredicted and vicious. He had no concept of pain . or the result of causing pain and he showed no mercy to his victims. ‘He would be reading a book and then seconds later he would be jumping on the chest of one of his class mates. ‘Once, over-excited during the . preparations for a school party, Mark punched one of my female . colleagues in the jaw. It appeared that at home he was watching . wrestling all the time and was trying to imitate the wrestlers. ‘Everything . related to violence fascinated him. Once he appeared at the school with . a large assault knife. Luckily one of my colleagues saw him just before . he entered  the school.’ His behaviour worsened when he reached secondary school and he was sent away to live in Manchester with an aunt. Pam Duggan, mother of Mark Duggan who was shot by police in north London in 2011, cries outside the Royal Courts of Justice . During the inquest his mother claimed Duggan returned to Tottenham several years later as a ‘well balanced’ man. What . was carefully omitted was the fact the one of Duggan’s uncles was the . late Desmond ‘Dessie’ Noonan, whose feared family are ‘major players’ in . the Manchester underworld. Duggan . is said to have regularly spent time with Noonan before the crime boss . was stabbed to death in 2005 at the age of 46 by a Jamaican enforcer . working for a Yardie drug gang. Dublin-born Noonan dominated the Manchester underworld in  the 1990s and made numerous appearances in court charged  with violence. During an interview for a TV documentary called Gangster in 2005, Noonan suggested his family were untouchables. He said: ‘We have a lot of strong . loyal people around us. We will always have that. If they think they can . take one of us out, they are silly people. Very silly people.’ He also boasted: ‘I’ve got a bigger army than the police. We have more guns than the police.’ A photograph of a gun, shown as evidence to the jury at the Royal Courts of Justice, during the inquest for Mark Duggan . And . at one stage during the Channel 5 documentary with journalist Donal . MacIntyre, he hinted that he was responsible for 27 murders. Hundreds . of so-called ‘Noonan Boys’ – youngsters said to be allied to the crime . family – were allegedly among the rioters and looters in Manchester city . centre in 2011. On his return to London, Duggan hooked up with TMD and his life of gang crime began. Known as ‘Starrish Mark’ in recent years, Duggan was also a senior member of The Star Gang, which is an off-shoot of TMD. In the months before he died, Duggan is said to have become obsessed with the death of his cousin Kelvin Easton. The 23-year-old was stabbed through the heart with a broken champagne bottle at a nightclub in East London in a row over drugs and a woman in March 2011. Duggan is said to have become paranoid about his own safety and carried a gun for protection. One source said he was planning to avenge the death. Friends say he was intending to marry 29-year-old Semone Wilson, his long-term partner, and move away from Tottenham with their two sons, aged 12 and nine, and three-year-old daughter. But in the end, the lure of  guns and violence proved to be  too strong.","The 29-year-old was one of the most violent gangsters in Europe – and linked to ten shootings and two murders .

"By . Jennifer Newton . A cancer survivor is pledging to run a 10k race in honour of a terminally ill teenager who has already raised £2.6million for charity. Hannah Merridale, 29, had the middle and lower lobe of her right lung removed after she developed a carcinoid tumour. But after hearing about the plight of Stephen Sutton, Ms Merridale from Isleworth, West London has decided to dust off her running shoes and enter the 10k Clapham Race for Life next month. Hannah Merridale, left, who despite having the middle and lower lobe of her right lung removed is running a 10k in honour of Stephen Sutton, right . Stephen, who believes he has just days left to live, told the world he was on the brink of death after suffering from bowel cancer. He set himself a ‘bucket list’ of 46 challenges to tick off in his final days, including a charity skydive, quizzes, a football match and playing the drums in front of a huge crowd. Stephen managed to tick off  33 goals, the first of which was raising £10,000 for the Teenage Cancer Trust. But his plight captured the hearts of those who followed his Facebook, Twitter and other internet updates that he used the growing goodwill to continue fundraising and he has now raised £2.6million. Ms Merridale, a post production media supervisor at BSkyB, said: 'One of the things on his bucket list is to inspire someone to raise money for charity and I am going to do just that.

It prompted him to gather the strength to write a Facebook message from his hospital bed. He said: ' ‘Hi guys, it’s Stephen here again, and it feels so good to be able to put that. Currently I am feeling well and would describe my current situation as stable. ‘Different people will put my recent physical improvement down to different reasons; I don’t want to over dramatise things too much, but I do just want to mention that everyone’s positive thoughts and support has been hugely appreciated, so thank you for that. ‘The tumours in my body are still rife and dangerous, but I feel so lucky to just still be here, and in fact I feel completely privileged to be in this position where I can help make such a difference to other people’s lives. ‘The main thing I’ve always felt passionately about is helping others... I’ve always been a firm believer that people are “good”, and to see people come together for the cause recently in the way they have is incredibly touching and heartwarming. ‘Thank you from me, and also thank you from every young cancer patient in the future who will benefit invaluably from the money raised!’ To donate to Stephen's page visit www.justgiving.com/Stephen-Sutton-TCT .

"By . Lydia Warren . A leader in the controversial Quiverfull movement - which promotes family values and male dominance over women - has resigned and closed his ministry after having an affair. Doug Phillips, who is married with eight children, announced he was stepping down from Vision Forum Ministries, based in San Antonio, Texas, in a statement on his website on October 30. 'I engaged in a lengthy, inappropriate . relationship with a woman,' he wrote. 'While we did not ""know"" each . other in a Biblical sense, it was nevertheless inappropriately romantic . and affectionate.' Then on Monday, in light of Phillips' 'serious sins', the Board of Directors of the ministries concluded that 'it is in the best interests of all involved to discontinue operations'. Cheat: Doug Phillips, leader of Vision Forum Ministries, has quit after an affair. He is pictured (right) with his family: from right, wife Beall, Joshua, Justice, Liberty, Jubilee, Faith, Honor, Providence and Virginia Hope . It added: 'While we believe as . strongly as ever in the message of the ministry to the Christian family, . we are grieved to find it necessary to make this decision. We believe . this to be the best option for the healing of all involved and the only . course of action under the circumstances.' Phillips had asked for forgiveness in his resignation letter - and praised his wife, Beall, for her strength after he told her about his indiscretion. 'There . are no words to describe the magnitude of shame I feel, or grief from . the injury I caused my beloved bride and children, both of whom have . responded to my repentance with what seems a supernatural love and . forgiveness,' he wrote. 'I thought too highly of myself and behaved without proper accountability. I have acted grievously before the Lord, in a destructive manner hypocritical of life messages I hold dear.' The affair indeed is at odds with what he has long been preaching; Vision . Forum Ministries call the family 'the basic agency of dominion on . earth' and claims it 'is under attack from every side today' - including . homosexuality and feminism. Famous figure: Phillips' ministry promotes the 'Biblical patriarchy' and male dominance over women . While Phillips led his own ministries, he was also a famous adherent to the Quiverfull movement, which is also followed by Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar on TLC’s '19 Kids and Counting' The Quiverfull is a Christian evangelical movement in which followers avoid contraception and have as many children as they can. It is based upon Psalm 127:3-5, which says in part: 'Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward... Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them.' The movement also advocates a return to 'traditional' roles in the home, where a woman is a wife and mother before anything else. Followers believe women are designed to support their husband as head of the household. In the US, Quiverfull families often reach up to a dozen children with the numbers of adherents in the tens of thousands. He . preaches that a man is called to 'rule over his household' and 'the . God-ordained and proper sphere of dominion for a wife is the household'. His . ministries also reject birth control and believe that large families . are a sign of God's blessings - an attitude reflected by his friends Jim . Bob and Michelle Duggar on TLC’s '19 Kids and Counting'. In order to 'exercise dominion' over . growing families and carry out his 200-year plans, he teaches families . to home school their children. The schooling teaches girls domestic . duties, while boys are taught to uphold 'Biblical' gender norms by being . chivalrous and adventurous. College education is for them only. In this climate, his wife, an adherent of his conservative teachings, is left with no options. Julie . Ingersoll, an associate professor of Religious Studies at the . University of North Florida, wrote for the Huffington Post that the community is unlikely to support Phillips' wife. 'The leaders (all male) are . likely to be sympathetic the husband's ""temptation"" and should she . discuss the situation outside of the sanctioned forums controlled by men . she will be denounced as a gossip,' she wrote. 'Sometimes the women are blamed: the . ""other woman"" as Satan's temptress and even the completely innocent wife . for having ""let herself go"" or being inadequately submissive.' Video source YouTube . Apology: Phillips, pictured center with some of his family members, asked for forgiveness - and commentators said it is likely his community with support him and, if anything, blame the women in the situation . Growing family: He is close friends with the Duggar family (pictured) - the stars of TLC's '19 Kids and Counting' and fellow adherents of the Quiverfull movement . He has earned a tidy sum by preaching . this message. In 2011, his ministry reported $3.3 million in revenue . and Phillips received $44,000 in salary for a 30-hour workweek for the . ministry. Phillips' influence over his community is far reaching. He began working as an attorney at the Home School Legal Defense Association and has become a popular speaker at home school conventions. Phillips has also been active in the Tea Party in San Antonio.","Doug Phillips, an adherent of the Quiverfull movement - which promotes male dominance and large families - has quit as leader of his ministries .

"By . James  Nye . Michael Sam, Missouri's All-American defensive lineman has announced he is gay - putting him in the position of becoming the first publicly gay pro-football player in the NFL. Sam, 23, a 6-foot-2, 260-pound senior, is predicted to be drafted into the NFL and came out in  series of coordinated interviews with The New York Times and ESPN's Outside the Lines program on Sunday. 'I'm Michael Sam. I'm a football player and I'm gay,' Sam, a defensive lineman, said in the video posted online. 'I just want to own my truth before anyone breaks a story about me.' Strong: Missouri senior defensive lineman Michael Sam speaks to the media during an NCAA college football news conference in Irving, Texas. Sam says he is gay, and he could become the first openly homosexual player in the NFL . Coming out: Missouri All-American Michael Sam says he is gay, and the defensive end could become the first openly homosexual player in the NFL . Proud: Michael Sam came out to his team mates earlier this year and here he is celebrating with fans after the game against the Kentucky Wildcats at Commonwealth Stadium on November 9, 2013 in Lexington, Kentucky. Missouri won 48-17 . He went on to say that when he first spoke with his teammates about his sexuality last August, they rallied around him and supported him. 'We admire Michael Sam's honesty and courage,' the NFL said in a statement. 'Michael is a football player. Any player with ability and determination can succeed in the NFL. We look forward to welcoming and supporting Michael Sam in 2014.' The Missouri senior led the Southeastern Conference last season with 10-and-a-half sacks and 18 tackles and the Associated Press named him SEC defensive player of the year. Representatives for Sam had been letting NFL teams aware that he was planning to come out before this month's NFL scouting combine. And on Saturday evening, it was revealed that Sam dined with group of supporters, including former NFL punter Chris Kluwe and linebackers Brendon Ayanbadejo - who are both outspoken supporters of gay rights. Respect: In interviews with ESPN, The New York Times and Outsports that were published Sunday, Michael Sam said his teammates and coaches at Missouri have known since August. No NFL player has ever announced publicly he's gay while his career is active. Former players including Esera Tuaolo have admitted they are gay after retiring. In his series of interviews, Sam said, 'I am an openly, proud gay man.' 'It's a big deal. No one has done this before. And it's kind of a nervous process, but I know what I want to be ... I want to be a football player in the NFL.' Other athletes to come out as gay have included Jason Collins, a veteran of 12 NBA seasons who revealed he was homosexual last year and Robbie Rogers, who plays Major League Soccer with the LA Galaxy. Division III Willamette kicker Conner Mertens, a redshirt freshman, said last month he was bisexual.Sam said many people at the college all-star game for NFL prospects seemed to know that he was gay. Before coming out to all his teammates and coaches, Sam said he told a few close friends and dated another Missouri athlete who was not a football player. Sportsman: Before coming out to all his teammates and coaches, Sam said he told a few close friends and dated another Missouri athlete who was not a football player . 'Coaches just wanted to know a little about ourselves, our majors, where we're from, and something that no one knows about you,' Sam said. 'And I used that opportunity just to tell them that I was gay. And their reaction was like, `Michael Sam finally told us.'"" Missouri coach Gary Pinkel said in a statement Sunday night he was proud of Sam and how he represented the program. 'Michael is a great example of just how important it is to be respectful of others, he's taught a lot of people here first-hand that it doesn't matter what your background is, or your personal orientation, we're all on the same team and we all support each other,' Pinkel said. 'If Michael doesn't have the support of his teammates like he did this past year, I don't think there's any way he has the type of season he put together.' First: NBA Player Jason Collins became the first active basketball player to come out last year and Robbie Rogers 8 (right) of Team USA and LA Galaxy came out last year too . Missouri linebacker Donovan Bonner has been a teammate of Sam's for five years. 'We knew of his status for 5 years and not one team member, coach, or staff member said anything says a lot about our family atmosphere,' Bonner tweeted. GLAAD, a national lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender advocacy group responded to the news Sunday night. 'By rewriting the script for countless young athletes, Michael has demonstrated the leadership that, along with his impressive skills on the field, makes him a natural fit for the NFL,' GLAAD President Sarah Kate Ellis said in a statment. 'With acceptance of LGBT people rising across our coasts — in our schools, churches, and workplaces -- it's clear that America is ready for an openly gay football star.' Speaking to ESPN, Sam said that, 'I came to tell the world' about his sexual orientation. He said that though he was nervous about doing it, it also felt good. 'It's a load off my chest,' he said. 'I told my teammates this past August that I came out to my teammates, and they took it great. They rallied around me, they supported me, and I couldn't have asked for better teammates.'","Missouri All-American Michael Sam says he is .

"By . Associated Press . You've heard of flash mobs? Behold the Mass mob. Playing off the idea of using social media to summon crowds for . parties or mischief, mobs of Buffalo-area Roman Catholics have been . filling pews and lifting spirits at some of the city's original, now . often sparsely attended, churches. It works this way: On a given Sunday, participants attend Mass en . masse at a church they've picked in an online vote and promoted through . Facebook and Twitter. Visitors experience the architecture, heritage and . spirit of the aging houses of worship and the churches once again see . the numbers they were built for, along with a helpful bump in donations . when the collection baskets are passed. People gathered for mass inside Our Lady of Perpetual Help Church in Buffalo as part of 'Mass Mob' 'I call these churches faith enhancers. You can't help but walk in . and feel closer to a higher power,' said Christopher Byrd, who hatched . the idea in Buffalo last fall and has organized two Mass mobs so far, . both of which drew hundreds. He's heard from other cities about starting . their own. The aim, he said, is to reignite interest, support and perhaps even . membership in older churches that 'kind of fall off the radar screen of . people.' One such church is Our Lady of Perpetual Help in a neighborhood . settled by Irish immigrants along the Buffalo River. The church once . brimmed with 800 families when it was dedicated in 1900. Today, fewer . than 50 worshippers typically amble into the Gothic-style sanctuary for . Sunday Mass. It's a familiar story among city churches that were built for waves . of Polish, German, Irish and Italian immigrants but whose congregations . have dwindled with the city's population decline and suburban sprawl. Buffalo's population is less than half what it was in 1950, when it . peaked at 580,000. 'We're still here,' said the Rev. Donald Lutz, who welcomed a crowd . of more than 300 on a recent Sunday after Our Lady of Perpetual Help, . known to locals as 'Pets,' was selected for the Mass mob. Head Mobster: Christopher Byrd organizes the Mass Mobs in Buffalo . Organizers sought nominations from the public for churches on the . Mass mob website and put the top three up for a vote. Online voting . begins this week for the next mob, planned for March 23. 'It's wonderful,' said Lutz, who learned his church had been chosen . two weeks before.'It just shows that we are not just one parish, that . it's the whole family of the diocese. We take care of each other. 'and,' he added, 'if it helps us pay a few more bills ...' With every pew occupied, later-arriving worshippers stood against the . back wall, reminding 88-year-old parishioner Elizabeth Barrett of the . way it used to be in the church she has attended since birth, a block . from her lifelong home. 'You had to get here very early when I was young, it was so crowded,' she said. 'And now there are just a handful. It's hard to accept, but . you have to.' During the sign of peace, Lutz spent several minutes breezing up and . down aisles, smiling and shaking hands. He invited all to a nearby . community center for a pastry and coffee after the service. Several visitors arrived at the church with cameras, aiming them at . brilliant stained-glass windows imported from Austria, the church's . pride and joy, and the ornate marble altar, the likes of which are . seldom seen in the more modern suburban churches built today. Our lady of perpetual help in Buffalo where the last mass mob met up to pray . ""It's wonderful to see the old churches. They're beautiful,"" said . Barbara Mocarski, who came from nearby Lackawanna to be part of the mob. While the sanctuary is largely well-preserved, areas of cracking . plaster and water stains show a need for costly maintenance. ""Seeing the community together and caring about them, I was really happy to hear about it,"" Mocarski said. Karen Huber of the suburb of West Seneca hoped the Mass mob idea . would bring more young people back to church so that crowds would again . be the rule, not the exception. The eight-county Diocese of Buffalo, in a restructuring, has closed . nearly 100 churches in recent years as attendance and financial support . has declined and priests have retired. Days after the Mass mob came an . announcement that 10 suburban Catholic schools would close after this . school year. Byrd, 46, plans about six Buffalo Mass mobs a year. Chris Clemens and . Luke Myer made the 90-minute trip from Rochester and are already . promoting the idea in their city, where they blog about upstate New . York's religious and spiritual history and sites. Byrd, an activist in the Broadway-Fillmore neighborhood where he grew . up, said there has been interest from other cities, too, and he hopes . the flash mob social media hook will resonate with a younger generation . for whom the pull of family tradition has relaxed. Said Byrd, 'They may think it's cool'","Playing off the idea of using social media to summon crowds for .

A young entrepreneur was baffled when a Portland security guard thwarted her attempt to help her father pay for her braces by selling mistletoe - but told her she could beg, instead.Madison Root, 11, arrived bright and early at Portland Saturday Market, setting up a sign and basket next to the Skidmore Fountain in the downtown area to sell her wares to the crowds.That's when a security guard swooped in and told her to stop selling her mistletoe because she was violating city code - but said that she could beg for money, or give it away and ask for a donation. Entrepreneur: Madison Root wanted to help her father pay for her braces by selling mistletoe at Portland Saturday Market . Thwarted: The young businesswoman was prevented from selling her wares by bureaucratic red tape . Madison Root knew her upcoming orthodontic work would be expensive, and wanted to contribute. She . spent Friday cutting mistletoe at her uncle's farm in Newberg, then . wrapped it in clear cellophane and tied it with a red ribbon. Her father, Ashton Root, supported his daughter's work ethic and drove her to the market on Saturday morning. 'I . wouldn't think I'd have any problems because people are asking for . money, people are selling stuff, this is a public place,' Madison told . KATU. 'There were people right next to me with signs that said, 'Got pot?' she said. 'They're raising money for pot!' Root . says a private security guard for the market told them that they were . violating city code (specifically Chapter 20.12.020, 'Soliciting For or . Conducting Business' in a public park). Under the rule, it's illegal to . 'sell or offer to sell any article or service' without a permit. Braces: Madison's orthodontic work will cost more than $6,000 . Work ethic: Madison spend her time on Friday cutting mistletoe at her uncle's farm, then wrapped it herself to sell . Disappointed: Ashton Root (right) says his daughter would rather work than beg . Disillusioned Madison told KATU, 'People can get money for pot but I can't get money for braces? I'm working for this, they're just sitting down on their butts all day asking for pot.' Spokesman for the Portland Park Bureau told KATU that while selling at the market without a permit is illegal, begging is designated as a form of free speech, and is protected under the First Amendment. 'We totally understand the rule,' Ashton Root told Oregon Live. 'But here she was selling mistletoe and all around her were people playing music for money, or asking for money for pot, or just spare change. We’re allowing people to beg, but not to sell; it seems like there should be some sort of exception.' A vendor at the market agrees: 'They should have a caveat for children trying to create options for commerce, especially this time of year,' Sharon Steen, co-owner of Perfect Bowls told KATU. 'We encourage it. We want them to grow up and be entrepreneurs.' Under the mistletoe: Madison picked the bunches of mistletoe and wrapped them herself . Anything goes... almost: Panhandlers, street musicians and and stalls abound at the Portland Saturday Market, but without a permit, Madison was told she could either beg or give her mistletoe away . The kissoff: Madison Root plans to return to the market to sell mistletoe again in what she is calling 'The Great Kissoff' When news of Madison's aborted market day got around, one supporter called to order 30 bags of mistletoe. Ashton Root also told ABC News that McKinzei Farms, one of the area's biggest Christmas tree farms, had made a donation of $1,000 for Madison's braces . Despite the windfall, the determined 11-year-old has decided to return to the market with her mistletoe on December 14 for what she is calling 'The Great Kissoff.' 'I feel that I can make a statement and possibly make a difference,' she told Oregon Live. 'The city laws are supporting begging and are against working.' She is preparing a speech that lays out her 'work for it' mentality and plans to bring mistletoe. 'She may break the law, or just give it away,’ her dad said. 'Donations accepted.' Madison had the top set of braces fitted today.","Madison Root, 11, picked and wrapped mistletoe to sell at a Portland market to contribute to the cost of her braces .

"By . Emma Innes . A teenager who developed a rare brain condition and forgot the first 16 years of her life following a seizure has been forced to piece her childhood together using family photos. When Rosie Paley, 19, woke up in hospital every memory of her childhood were gone and she didn't even recognise two young brothers and mother. The teenager, from Brierley Hill, West Midlands, was 16 when she developed encephalitis, which causes inflammation of the brain. Rosie Paley, 19, forgot the first 16 years of her life and didn't recognise her own mother after having a fit . In a matter of hours she lost memories of every milestone from her childhood, and even forgot her favourite foods, bands and the fact she knew how to ride a horse. It has now taken her three years to piece her childhood memories back together, and she has relied on photographs, stories and childhood toys for help. Rosie said: ‘When I look back at pictures I can see I had an amazing childhood. I just wish I had memories to go with the pictures.’ With the support of her family, Rosie can now recognise her mother Helen, 36, and her brothers Rhys, four, Ollie, two, but she has lost her childhood friends, as she can’t remember any of them. Rosie said: ‘I’ve lost all my childhood friends as I can’t recognise them or reminisce about old times and so it’s hard to be around them as they knew the old me before the memory loss. ‘But for me, life is now about making new memories. I’m having to start from the beginning.’ Rosie developed encephalitis - swelling of the brain - which was caused by an infection, when she was 16 . She had a fit and fell down some stairs so was rushed to hospital and when she woke up she couldn't remember her childhood. She is now using pictures to help herself piece together her younger years . Rosie had been out for the day in with her boyfriend in August 2011 when she suddenly collapsed. She managed to get home and was put to bed, but had another seizure and fell down the stairs. Medics were left baffled by the 16-year-old’s behaviour, as she hadn’t shown any symptoms before. Encephalitis is an uncommon but serious condition that causes inflammation of the brain. It usually begins with flu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature and a headache. More serious symptoms can then develop. These include confusion, disorientation, seizures and changes in personality. There are several different types of encephalitis that have different causes. The most common are caused by infections or an autoimmune reaction. The illness requires urgent treatment - usually in an intensive care unit and about 10 per cent of cases are fatal. Some people make a full recovery but many experience permanent brain damage. This can cause complications such as memory loss, epilepsy, personality changes and fatigue. Source: NHS Choices . Rosie said: ‘When I first came round, mum brought my two younger brothers to see me. I had no idea who they were and I panicked. ‘My mum had to introduce them to me. I found it really difficult, but they took it in their stride. ‘Getting to know them again has been great though - Rhys loves telling me tales about all the things we have done together that I can’t remember. The teenager had just finished her GCSEs and attended her school prom when she lost her memory- two events in her life she has no recollection of. But she is determined to stay positive and is training to be a hairdresser, despite still struggling with her short-term memory. Rosie said: ‘I have had to change every aspect of my life now because I don’t know what I was like before.’ As a child Rosie was a big fan of the band Steps, and her mother took her to a Steps concert to try and jog her memory - but Rosie couldn’t remember any of her favourite songs. Her encephalitis was caused by the herpes simplex virus - the same bug responsible for cold sores and chicken pox - but doctors were baffled as she showed no symptoms prior to suffering a seizure. Normally, patients develop flu like symptoms before suffering a seizure. Medics at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, were forced to sedate Rosie because her seizure was so bad, but when she eventually came around her memories were gone. Rosie (pictured with her mother, Helen, and brothers, Ollie and Rhys) still doesn't remember her childhood . Rosie's mother, Helen, is trying to help her trigger memories that she has forgotten . Her mother said: ‘Rosie woke up and looked at me with a blank expression and said: “Who are you?” I was heartbroken and terrified.’ She added: ‘I thought she would never remember me. ‘Luckily after a few hours she began to recognise me and even asked for her favourite childhood teddy bear, Baa lamb, which is still the only thing she remembers. ‘I tried to surround her with family and things that she might remember but she didn’t even recognise her two younger brothers. ‘We even took her to a Steps concert, as they were her favourite band, but she couldn’t recognise any of the songs.’ In an attempt to jog her memory, Rosie has surrounded herself with old pictures, creating a wall of photographs in her bedroom. Rosie (pictured with her brothers) also has short-term memory problems now . Rosie (pictured as a baby) now has to write herself detailed instructions of how to carry out everyday tasks as she is unable to remember how to do them . She said: ‘When I looked at the pictures I could see how happy I was at the time but it just draws a blank in my head as I can’t think of the actual event or how I was feeling at the time. ‘Most people my age look back at high school as the best years of their life but I can’t do that, I can just look at the pictures and imagine what it must have been like.’ The teenager, who also now suffers with short term memory loss, has to write down instructions for her bus journey to work as well as reminders to help her complete everyday tasks. Rosie said: ‘I panic if I’m late and I have had to call my mum sometimes because I forget to get off at my stop and ended up at the last stop with no idea where I am. ‘It’s really stressful but as long as I have a routine I can handle it all. ‘Hairdressing is great because it’s repetitive and so I can keep practicing until I learn things and remember them. Despite her memory problems, Rosie is currently training to be a hair dresser. She is pictured in hospital with her baby brother who was born just a few weeks before she fell ill . Rosie (pictured as a child) says hairdressing suits her as it is repetitive so she is able to keep doing things until she remembers them . Her mother said: ‘I try and encourage Rosie to not rely on technology and just to get in the habit of repeating things until they are really clear for her. ‘We have a laugh about it and Rosie just refers to herself as a little bit ditzy rather than someone with a memory problem.’ Ava Easton, chief executive of the Encephalitis Society, said 4,000 new cases of the condition are identified every year in the UK. She said: ‘The causes include infection, and the immune system going rogue and attacking healthy tissue. ‘It is the herpes simplex that is most likely to attack the parts of the brain responsible for memory. ‘Of those people who survive encephalitis - the mortality rate is 80 per cent without swift treatment - seven out of ten respond to the anti-viral drug Aciclovor, ideally if it is given with 24 or 48 hours. ‘However, those whose memory has been attacked are unlikely to recover in that respect, although what sufferers can develop is better ways of coping with their condition.’","Rosie Paley, now 19, collapsed after a day out with her boyfriend in 2011 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A woman visiting her mother in Oregon is suing her neighbor and seeking $275,000 for pain, suffering and other damages that she says were inflicted when a pet duck ambushed her for no apparent reason. Cynthia Ruddell, 62, of Washougal, Washington, was on her mother's property in Estacada, Oregon, about 25 miles southeast of Portland, when a neighbor's duck attacked her without warning. According to the suit filed in Oregon state court last Friday, in her attempt to run away from the agitated swan, Ruddell fell to the ground, breaking her right wrist and spraining an elbow and shoulder. Scroll down for video... Quack attack: An Oregon woman is getting sued for a whopping $275,000 after her pet duck allegedly attacked a woman on the street, breaking the woman¿s wrist and spraining her elbow . The incident occurred in May 2012. The complaint accuses the bird's owner, Lolita Rose, of failing to maintain control of her pet or 'to warn or otherwise inform neighbors of her duck's dangerous propensity in attacking individuals.' Ruddell, a retired nurse, is seeking up to $275,000 in damages, including roughly $25,000 for medical expenses, with the remainder being for pain, suffering and the toll her injuries have taken on her daily life. 'These injuries, some of which may be permanent in nature, have caused her, and continue to cause her pain, suffering, inconvenience, humiliation and interfere with [her] normal and usual activities and have caused her permanent scarring all to her noneconomic damage in an amount to be determined by a jury, but are currently estimated not to exceed $250,000,' the lawsuit states.Ruddell said she has about $25,000 in medical bills so far because of her injuries. The lawsuit claims Rose should’ve known that the duck could be violent, and that the Oregon woman should be on the hook for negligence and the medical bills. Duck face: Cynthia Ruddell says a duck (not pictured) caused her to fall, leading her to file a negligence lawsuit against the duck's owner . 'As the possessor of a domestic animal that the defendant knew, or had reason to know, had abnormally dangerous propensities in attacking people in an aggressive manner similar to how it attacked and injured Mrs. Ruddell, defendant is strictly liable for all injuries her duck caused Mrs. Ruddell' the suit goes on to say. Ruddell's lawyer, Gregory Price, said it was his understanding that Rose had her duck killed after the incident. Rose could not be reached for comment on the case. Price said he expects the damages will ultimately be paid by Rose's insurance policy, but filing a lawsuit was necessary as a precaution because of continuing medical bills from a second surgery on his client's wrist and a two-year statute of limitations on such claims. Along with the lingering effects of the attack, the legal case has brought Ruddell a measure of unwanted attention, her attorney said. 'I've learned a lesson,' he said. 'In any future lawsuit I'll talk about my client being attacked by a domestic animal. Not by a duck.'","Alleged victim Cynthia Ruddell says she was attacked by the pet duck as she walked past owner Lolita Rose's Oregon home in May 2012 .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . The number of suicides across the military fell by more than 15 percent in 2013, despite more Army National Guard and Reserve soldiers taking their own lives last year than the year before. According to data gathered by The Associated Press from major military braches, 151 active soldiers killed themselves in 2013. That is 24 less than the year before, with 185 taking their own lives in 2012. However it wasn't all good news, with a separate 152 members of the Army National Guard and Reserve took their own lives last year, compared to 140 the previous year. Results: Col. Elspeth Ritchie, a doctor in the Office of the Army Surgeon General, discusses efforts to study and understand suicide among American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.The Pentagon plans to release a report Friday April 25, 2014 on military suicides, with early figures showing a drop in rates for 2013 . There were 289 active duty suicides across all major military branches in 2013, down from 343 in 2012. The drop in overall suicides may be a promising sign for the Pentagon, which has been actively increasing prevention efforts to help those at risk of taking their own lives. According to an official report released by the Pentagon, almost 93 percent of military suicides were male, 74 percent were white and almost 40 percent were between 17-24. Some 65 percent used a firearm; almost 76 percent of those used a gun that was not issued by the military, while 25 percent died of asphyxiation, including hanging. More than 33 percent tested positive for alcohol use; about 24 percent tested positive for drugs . However, military leaders are not being quick to call the slight decreases a victory. 'I think we've changed the cultural mindset — that it's O.K. for a sailor or a soldier or an airman or Marine to come forward and ask for help,' said Navy Rear Adm. Sean Buck, who is in charge of suicide prevention for his branch of the armed services. 'We're trying to reduce the stigma that used to exist.' U.S. Marines of Police Advisory Team patrol a village in the Now Zad district in Helmand province, Afghanistan. While many reservists who committed suicide served in Afghanistan in 2013, there is no evidence to prove a link between serving overseas and suicide . The Pentagon is expected to release its own suicide data Friday. While the numbers are expected to differ slightly, one issue will remain unchanged: the slight increase in Army National Guard and Reserves soldiers who committed suicide in 2013 compared to 2012. The AP reports many reservists that committed suicide served in Iraq and Afghanistan, though there is no evident link between service and suicide. Also featured in the report was ... — 55 percent of unsuccessful suicide attempts involved drugs . — 42 percent had a history of some type of behavioral health diagnosis . — More than 28 percent had talked about harming themselves prior to the suicide . — 40 percent reported family or relationship stress in the 90 days prior to suicide; 32 percent reported financial or work stress . — 57 percent had been deployed . — 47 percent had been deployed to the Iraq or Afghanistan wars .","151 active soldiers killed themselves last year, compared with 185 the year before .

"By . Taylor Auerbach . A Sydney primary school teacher has been awarded $689,294 in damages after she was 'violently pulled' to the ground by an eight-year-old Sudanese refugee pupil - legally only identifiable as Student X - at a school in the city's northwest. Jeannette Sticker, a primary school teacher since 1979, successful sued the NSW Department of Education & Communities after judge Leonard Levy found her employer failed to 'act in a timely manner to protect the staff and students at the school from the violent, aggressive and anti-social behaviour of X'. Ms Sticker, 55, suffered a lumbar disc protrusion on March 18, 2009, when attempting to discipline Student X for 'behaving aggressively, including using a stick to assault other students' at Bert Oldfield Public School in Seven Hills, which boasts the motto 'Safe, Respectful, Responsible Learners.' Suffering: Jeannette Sticker has been dealing with 'serious' injuries since the ugly school incident and now has difficult even sitting . The District Court of NSW heard that Ms Sticker broke up the fight and began leading Student X, in Year 2 at the time, to the principal's office, but 'unexpectedly for the plaintiff, X propped and braced himself in a doorway in the corridor with his free hand and with his feet, and he then violently pulled the plaintiff backwards with some force'. The fall caused 'serious twisting injury to her lower back and to her right hip', forcing Ms Sticker to undergo surgery and suffer significant loss of earnings, the court found. She has suffered 'constant pain' and has 'difficulty sitting, standing or walking for sustained periods' since the injury. She became unemployed February 22, 2011, due her diminished ability to work, the court found. Student X, a Sudanese boy who has spent time in refugee camps, 'was seen to represent an extreme danger to others' by the school prior to Ms Sticker's injuries. He was found to display 'uncontrolled behaviour', 'had hit and kicked other children in the past', was a source of 'danger to himself, other pupils and to teachers', and other children were 'were frightened of him' at the time of the incident. Judge Levy found that systemic failings were to blame for the school not acting with enough urgency in addressing the risk posed by Student X, and 'The response of the school lacked immediacy for such a serious problem where students and staff remained at risk of serious injury in circumstances where the slightest trigger could precipitate the behaviours in question.' Negligent: Judge Leonard Levy ruled that the NSW Department of Education (which runs Bert Oldfield Public School) was negligent in failing to protect Ms Sticker from Student X . The Department claimed Ms Sticker was somewhat to blame for her own injuries for 'Failing to take any or any proper precautions for her own safety in all the circumstances; being inattentive; and conducting her work in a manner contrary to her induction and training.' Those arguments were dismissed by judge Levy. Ms Sticker now works as the national training manager for a private college in Australia and earns significantly less income due to her disabilities, the court agreed. In a decision handed down earlier this month, as a result of the school not taking reasonable steps to prevent the 'deliberate violent act', Ms Sticker was awarded $480,250 for future loss of income and superannuation, $179,807 for past loss of income and superannuation, and a further $29,237 in compensation for the tax she has paid on workers' compensation since the injury. The decision came three months after the NSW Industrial Relations Commission dismissed an appeal against the NSW Department of Education by Stephen Krix, 51, who was sacked for misconduct after putting a student who punched him in the face in a headlock at Riverstone Highschool, also in Sydney's northwest. Neither Ms Sticker nor her lawyer immediately returned MailOnline's calls.

"By . James Chapman, Daily Mail Political Editor . Chancellor George Osborne, who was out running in Westminster yesterday, could make an announcement on freezing benefits in December . Benefits are set to be frozen in the Government’s drive to save billions more from the welfare budget. Government sources confirmed that the drastic move, which has previously been fiercely resisted by the Liberal Democrats, is being considered and could be announced by George Osborne in December. Ministers are also examining the idea of ending the annual inflation-linked rise in benefits, though this would require legislation and is a longer-term prospect. In recent years, inflation has risen at a far higher rate than average earnings, prompting growing controversy over annual increases in benefit rates. Whitehall officials say £14billion could have been saved since 2009 if the increase had been pegged to earnings. ‘Earnings have not been rising and people working in both the public and private sectors have had to accept pay freezes,’ said one Government source. ‘Yet benefits have been rising. It should be addressed.’ In February, MPs agreed that the jobless would see their benefits rise by 5.2 per cent to protect them against ‘cost of living increases’. The overall rise in welfare payments, which will cost taxpayers £6.6billion in the current financial year, was more than double the average pay increase of around 2.1 per cent which those in work can expect. Tory MPs argued that the fact that . those on benefits will see their income increase more than those in work . made it harder for ministers to argue that they are making work pay. The . Chancellor is now seeking up to £10billion in extra savings from the . welfare budget, but any move to freeze benefits will strain coalition . relations and anger charities representing vulnerable groups. The state pension would be unaffected, since the Coalition has introduced a ‘triple lock’, which means it will rise annually in line with either inflation, earnings, or by 2.5 per cent, whichever is the highest figure. But it would be politically difficult to announce a blanket freeze on all disability benefits. Government sources suggested, however, that the Lib Dems have shifted on the issue and are ready to consider the move. They are likely to try to insist that David Cameron reconsiders his refusal to consider means-testing some universal benefits, such as winter fuel payments and free bus passes for all – an argument being backed by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith. Downing Street failed to issue a denial on the suggestion that ministers are looking at a freeze and then an end to the link with inflation. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said the decision on whether to increase benefit payments in line with inflation was made on an annual basis, usually in December, for the following year. ‘On some occasions thresholds are frozen or entitlements frozen,’ he said. Paul Jenkins, the chief executive of the charity Rethink Mental Illness, said: ‘This will come as yet another blow for many vulnerable people who are already struggling and who feel they are being unfairly targeted by cuts to the benefits system. ‘People with serious mental illnesses are being attacked from all sides as cuts to social care, the NHS and benefits all begin to bite at once. ‘People with illnesses such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, who are unable to work, deserve to be properly supported. ‘We urge the Government to consider how freezing benefits will affect the most vulnerable people in society, and to think again before making these changes.’","Drastic move, previously fiercely resisted by the Lib Dems, could be announced in December .

"By . Daniel Martin . One of David Cameron’s top advisers is leaving Downing Street to take a job with controversial payday loan firm Wonga. Jonathan Luff, the Prime Minister’s adviser on digital strategy, will move to the company – accused of acting as ‘legal loan sharks’ – immediately. The move will fuel the debate about the ‘revolving door’ between ministerial aides and lobbying, with fears that top businesses find it far too easy to hire influential mandarins with inside government knowledge. No more No.10: The digital adviser to Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured outside No. 10 Downing Street today, is leaving to work for Wonga . It comes only weeks after it emerged . that Tory ministers agreed to hold meetings with Wonga at the party’s . annual conference in exchange for donations. The payday loan company is being investigated by the Office of Fair Trading. Labour . MP Stella Creasy said last night: ‘Along with Wonga paying for cosy . chats at Conservative conference with ministers and the lack of . regulation to tackle the problems these companies are causing British . consumers, this appointment only further raises concerns about how . seriously this government takes personal debt. 'When . most other countries have capped the costs of credit to protect their . citizens from the debts this type of lending can cause, British . consumers urgently need to know whose side their Prime Minister is on: . theirs or the legal loan sharks?' Shady move: Former digital adviser to No.10 will be moving to payday loans company Wonga . The MP, who has been campaigning . against payday loans, questioned whether the appointment had been . approved by the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments. 'Like . many other legal loan sharks, Wonga is making massive profits from . preying on consumers in Britain's poorly regulated consumer credit . market,' she added. 'They . have used these profits to target our football clubs and Saturday night . TV, and now they are targeting the highest echelons of government. Those . Britons struggling with debts caused by payday lending and wondering . why the government is doing nothing to help them will want answers.' A . spokesman for Wonga said Mr Luff would lead the company's 'government . affairs team'. Criticism: Stella Creasy, MP for Walthamstow, has campaigned against payday loans like Wonga . On his twitter account, he wrote: 'What an extraordinary . week. Huge thanks to friends both old and new. #onwards.' Wonga has been fighting calls for new regulation which would limit its business activities and could lead to a cap on the interest rates they charge of up to 4,200 per cent a year. A spokesman for the Prime Minister said: 'We don't talk about individual members of staff. He is a civil servant. 'When civil servants leave the civil service there is a process that they have to go through. 'That applies in all cases but I am not going to talk about individuals.' It emerged earlier this month that a . controversial payday loan company paid £1,500 per head for tickets to . meet Government ministers at a 'speed dating' event.

Wonga gives loans of up to £1,000 to customers after only 15 minutes. The average amount is £255. Struggling: Payday loans companies like Wonga have been accused of taking advantage of indebted Britons, worsening their situations . Last year, as the firm benefited from customers' financial troubles, the number of loans it handed out rocketed by nearly 300 per cent to 2.5million. In February, the Office of Fair Trading began an inquiry into the payday loan industry amid fears that it may be 'taking advantage of people in financial difficulty'. Earlier this month, the debt advice charity, the Consumer Credit Counselling Service, said it has seen a 'dramatic' rise in the number of people with multiple payday loans seeking help. Between January and June, 2,015 of those who sought help had five or more payday loans, averaging a total of around £1,500. For the whole of 2009, there were just 716 such requests for help.","Prime Minister's adviser on digital strategy, Jonathan Luff, will move to Wonga with immediate effect .

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . Bar owners outraged by Putin's new 'gay propaganda' law are clearing their shelves of Russian vodka in protest. London nightspots including G-A-Y have stopped selling the booze in a show of support for the LGBT community in Russia - where displays of 'non-traditional sexual behaviour' in public or in front of under-18s are now prohibited by law. The law - which also allows the government to detain tourists and foreign nationals they suspect of being homosexual - has seen the global gay community begin to lose its taste for Russia's national drink. Scroll down for video . Down the drain: New laws prohibiting the public discussion of homosexuality in front of children in Russia has sparked a boycott of the country's vodka in bars from New York (pictured) to London . Boycott: Gay rights activists called for a boycott of imported brands like Russian Standard, left, and Stolichnaya, right - Stolichnaya has publicly declared its support for the LGBT community as a result . A CNN report shows bar owners in West Hollywood, U.S, emptying bottles of imported vodka down the drain, and G-A-Y owner Jeremy Joseph said the venue was keen to show its 'solidarity' with Russians who are 'suffering' as a result of the new laws. The boycott was sparked by Seattle-based blogger Dan Savage, who urged people to dump Russian vodka to 'draw international attention to the persecution of gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, trans people and straight allies in Putin's increasingly fascistic Russia'. He gave his campaign the hashtag #dumpstoli - a reference to one of country's most famous brands, Stolichnaya. Rebellion: Bar owners have been emptying bottles of Russian vodka down the drain in protest over Putin's new 'gay propaganda' law . Fury: Bottles of vodka have been emptied as bar owners react to Russia's new law . The firm has since gone to great lengths to distance itself from the 'dreadful actions' of the Russian government. Stolichnaya's CEO wrote in an open letter: 'Stolichnaya Vodka has always been, and continues to be a fervent supporter and friend to the LGBT community. Stolichnaya also unveiled new advertising proclaiming it 'stands strong and proud with the global LGBT community against the attitude and actions of the Russian government'. 'Dreadful actions': A gay rights activist is dragged away by Russian police officers at a protest in Moscow last year . G-A-Y owner Mr Joseph said the campaign was not about whether individual brands agreed with the government's stance. He compared the ban on vodka to boycotts of South African products that took place as a means of protesting against apartheid. The new laws in Russia also forbid the public discussion of homosexuality in front of children. 'This . is for us about getting a message across, standing in solidarity with . Russia's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community who are... suffering at the moment because of the new laws,' Mr Joseph. One Soho reveller told CNN: 'Why should we support them when they're discriminating against us? 'There's nothing wrong with us, we just love the same sex - it's not a crime.'","Gay bars from LA to London are pulling Russian vodka from the shelves .

"By . Robert Verkaik . and Stephanie Condron . Aborted mission: Gareth Williams' spy bosses were concerned about his state of mind at the time of his death . The handlers of ‘body in the bag’ spy Gareth Williams raised concerns about his state of mind on the day he was found dead inside his flat. The inquest into Mr Williams’s death heard that a senior executive at GCHQ, the Government’s secret listening post, told police that the MI6 spy may have reacted badly after being removed from a covert operation. A transcript of the call revealed that the executive added: ‘We are not sure how he’s taken that.’ The warning was passed on to officers searching for Mr Williams, who had been missing from work for more than a week. He was expected at MI6’s headquarters at Vauxhall Cross, South London, on Monday August 16, 2010. But his bosses did not raise the alarm until Friday and waited until after the weekend before deciding to call the police. Mr Williams’s naked body was discovered in a padlocked holdall in the bath of his flat in Pimlico, Central London, on the evening of August 23. The GCHQ warning has been seized on by Mr Williams’s parents as possible evidence of a cover-up about the truth of what happened to their son. The intelligence services have always claimed the spy’s death had nothing to do with his secret work. But the warning message appears to contradict this, as it suggests they were concerned about him after they had told him to withdraw from a secret operation. Gareth’s parents, Ian and Ellen Williams, and sister Ceri, from Anglesey, North Wales, believe the ‘dark arts’ of an unnamed secret agency may have been involved in his death. Evidence submitted to Westminster Coroner’s Court confirms that Mr Williams, who was on secondment to MI6 from GCHQ in Cheltenham, had been involved in covert operations in the months before he died. The spy worked in a four-man team as an expert code breaker and shortly before his death had been in contact with two secret agents working in the field in the UK. Concerns: Transcript of phone call from GCHQ to the Met about Gareth Williams the day his body was found . On August 11 he returned to London following a six-week visit to the US, where he had been part of a contingent of UK spies sent to a computer intelligence conference, known as the Black Hat. The coroner, Dr Fiona Wilcox, said on Friday that the Las Vegas conference attracted criminal hackers who attend the briefings to keep up with the latest developments in computer technology. But it is also used by security agencies from Britain and America to target hackers. The FBI has been reported to have sent teams of undercover agents to the conference to break up hacking cells, and also to mount clandestine operations to recruit criminal hackers as informants. If Mr Williams had gone to Las Vegas as part of an active intelligence operation he could have been exposed to dangers from criminal hacking gangs. But GCHQ insists that its officers in the US faced no greater risk than they did in the UK. His bosses also say Mr Williams, who . was due to end his secondment with MI6 in September 2010, had not been . working on an undercover operation at the time he went missing. The eight-day delay in GCHQ and MI6 . telling police he was officially missing has provoked accusations from . his family that they knew something ‘horrible’ had happened to him. Caught on camera: CCTV footage of Mr Williams at a tube station on August 14 . The inquest heard of a transcript of the call, made at 4.41pm on the 23rd by senior GCHQ officer Helen Yelland, in which she said: ‘He was last spoken to on Friday 13th. He was expected into work all of last week and did not appear. Both the landline and mobile phones are not picked up. The mobile is switched off. His sister was expecting to stay with him on Wednesday this week and she has not been able to contact him.’ The Metropolitan Police operator asked if there were any concerns, to which Ms Yelland replies: ‘He is going to be coming back to Cheltenham because he’s just been pulled back from a job he’s supposed to do and we are not sure how he’s taken that.’ Police suspect another person was involved in Mr Williams’s death and experts believe he was likely to have been unconscious or dead when he was placed in the bag. Forensic experts are still examining Mr Williams’s mobile phone after it emerged on Friday that all the data on it had been wiped. Detective Constable Robert Burrows told the inquest that he was unable to say when the iPhone, which was found in the living room of the flat, had been wiped before or after the spy’s death. The inquest has also heard how traces of the date-rape drug GHB were found in Mr Williams’s body. Forensic scientist Denise Stanworth said the traces were ‘probably’ naturally occurring, which is common after death, but admitted she could not rule out that it had been taken. MI6 has apologised for failing to raise the alarm about his disappearance, conceding the error may have hampered police inquiries. The inquest will tomorrow be told the results of an investigation into a second post-mortem examination ordered by the coroner’s office in the days after Mr Williams’s death. The spy’s family want to know why the police were not informed of this post-mortem examination, as they would have been in an ordinary murder inquiry. During the inquest, spies from MI6 and GCHQ have given evidence behind screens to protect their identities and Foreign Secretary William Hague has signed an order prohibiting the disclosure of details of Mr Williams’s work. The family’s barrister, Anthony O’Toole, told the inquest that since MI6 performed such an ‘important job’ it was even more vital that Mr Williams’s team leader – known as Witness G – should have done more to raise the alarm about the spy’s absence from work. It took Witness G five days before he visited Mr Williams’s flat. Dark arts: Mr Williams' family believe other secret agents were involved in his death . The team leader has told the inquest . he had been preparing to go into the field on a secret operation in the . week the Welsh spy went missing. The coroner has heard the dead spy was considered a ‘world-class’ intelligence officer by GCHQ. Stephen Gale, Mr Williams’s boss in Cheltenham, said the maths prodigy had won two awards for his code-breaking work. Dr Wilcox has intimated that she is prepared to consider a verdict of unlawful killing if she believes another person was involved in the death. The family want the coroner to explore the possibility that Mr Williams’s flat may have been wiped of other people’s DNA and the spy’s office computers tampered with. The electronic equipment was handed to Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command, SO15, on August 27, four days after the death came to light, the inquest heard. Mr O’Toole noted there was not ‘any statement from any person at GCHQ to say that equipment was not tampered with’ in the interim period. But Superintendent Michael Broster, who was responsible for SO15’s involvement in the investigation, insisted Mr Williams’s workplace had been ‘sealed and taped’.","Gareth Williams's spy bosses expressed concerns about his state of mind .

"By . Eddie Wrenn . This is the moment Jupiter was struck by a mighty meteorite yesterday - and our only record of it is this image, captured by a lone webcam chugging away in the early hours of the morning. As the people of Earth carried out their lives unawares, it seems our gas giant neighbour took a forceful blow to the side at about 11.35am GMT yesterday. Amateur astronomer George Hall, from Dallas, captured the flash on video at 5:35am CET - but he only went to check his footage after hearing online that another astronomer, watching the planet with his own eyes, saw the huge explosion bloom out of Jupiter in the blink of an eye. What a moment: Jupiter was struck by an asteroid yesterday, as confirmed by this image and a separate eye-witness . Now astronomers are waiting for the planet to swing back round - to see if Jupiter has been scarred by the impact. If it has, a black smudge is likely to appear on the 'clouds' of the planet, a distinctive mark to go alongside the Red Spot - Jupiter's giant storm. Jupiter has been known as the 'cosmic vacuum cleaner' of the solar system. The planet's mass and large orbit sweeps up the scattered meteors . that are relics from the early days of our solar system formation, with the planet . either 'taking the bullet' itself, or deflecting orbits away from the . inner planets. Many astronomers believe life would not have got . started on Earth with Jupiter's influence - and before our solar system . settled down, Earth was frequently bombarded with giant impacts. Jupiter has taken many a hit from the rocks that maraude their way through the solar system - remnants from the early days of the solar system when rocks would co-coalesce to form our planets. Asteroid impacts were reported in 2009 and 2010 - and in 1994, the string of comets known as Shoemaker-Levy ploughed into the planet, offering us an eerie glimpse of what happens in during such colossal impacts. George Hall, who blogs about his images, who went back through the footage recorded by his telescope overnight to find the impact, said: It's kind of a scary proposition to see how often Jupiter gets hit.' His image was captured by a 12-inch Meade Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope and a Point Grey Flea3 video camera attached to capture imagery for a composite picture of Jupiter. He said: 'Jupiter happens to be ideally positioned at about 6 o'clock in the morning - it's right overhead.' The flare lasted just two seconds - and Halls' equipment happened to capture the shot at exactly the right moment for the above image. 1994: Marks from the impact of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on the clouds of Jupiter, about two hours after impact . Shoemaker-Levy: The pieces of the comet all hit at roughly the same spot but at different times, and the planet rotated beneath it, the impact sites are spread along like a string of pearls . In many ways it is pure chance the flash was captured.  Astronomer Dan Petersen saw the impact live and reported it on the Association of Lunar and Planetary Observers' Jupiter forum. Hall visited the forum, saw the report, and decided to check his footage. He said: 'I decided to just observe on this particular morning. 'Had I been . imaging I probably would have missed it while playing with webcam . settings and focusing.' He told NBC: 'I never would have looked' if he hadn't heard the buzz on the forums, but luckily he checked his records for the same time reported by Petersen - 6:35am CT, 7:35 am ET, or 11:35 GMT - and found the image, appearing in just one frame. Later today as Jupiter's spin turns the right part of the planet's face back to Earth, astronomers will hunt out any visible signs of the impact. However, as Hall told, he will probably be in bed at the time. 'I'm almost 70 years old, he said. 'And it takes a lot out of me to get up at 4:30 or 5.' Hopefully, there will be a smear. If not, there would have been no record of the cosmic impact - other than in the eyeballs of an amateur astronomer, and a blurry still captured on a webcam.","Jupiter was hit during the day yesterday - but it apparently went unobserved from Earth .

"By . Steve Robson . A teenager convicted for the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman on a moving bus in Delhi has been jailed for just three years. The defendant, who was 17 at the time of the attack, was given the maximum sentence possible under Indian law. But despite having since turned 18, the attacker will not be publicly named. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Convicted: The teenager was escorted by Indian policeman to court wearing a pink hood to hide his identity . Punishment: Three years is the maximum sentence possible for the crime under Indian law . The crime, which left the victim with such extensive internal injuries that she died two weeks later, sparked widespread protests across the country and led to reforms of India's antiquated sexual violence laws. The victim's family called for the teenager to be tried as an adult, accusing him of being the most violent of the attackers. 'He . should be hanged irrespective of whether he is a juvenile or not. He . should be punished for what he did to my daughter,' said the . mother of the victim, said soon after the verdict was announced. 'You may as well set the juvenile free, . if the sentence is only three years for heinous offences like rape and . murder,' she added tearfully. The mother also said she would appeal against the verdict in a higher court. 'I . am not happy with this judgment. At least in this case, the juvenile . should have been sentenced to life,' the victim's brother told Reuters news agency. The government, facing immense public pressure, had promised swift justice in the case. The convicted defendant was one of six people accused of tricking a 23-year-old medical student and her male companion into boarding an off-duty bus December 16 after they had seen an afternoon showing of 'Life of Pi' at a shopping mall. Anger: Indian women participate in a silent procession to mourn the death of the gang rape victim . Fury: Following the attack, hundreds took to the street in protest to demand swift justice in the case and wide-ranging reforms to sex crime laws . Horrific: The girl was savagely attacked when she boarded a bus with a male friend after a trip to the cinema in December . Anger: The savage assault caused outrage throughout India. Protestors are pictured trying to break through a police cordon during a demonstration in New Delh . A dream destroyed: A man bows his head at a candlelit vigil for the 23-year-old student who died after being gang-raped on a moving bus in New Delhi . Police say the men raped the woman and used a metal bar to inflict massive internal injuries to her. They also beat her male companion. The victims were dumped naked on the roadside, and the woman died from her injuries in a Singapore hospital. Four of the other defendants are being tried in a special fast-track court in New Delhi and face the death penalty. The sixth accused was found dead in his jail cell in March. The court is expected to hand down the rest of the verdicts next month. The convicted defendant was tried as a . minor on charges including murder and rape. The time he spent in a . juvenile home since he was arrested in December will count as part of . his three-year sentence. Terror: The 23-year-old woman died after being gang raped by six men who also used a metal bar to cause massive internal injuries . The sentence is likely to cause further anger in a country attempting to . turn a rising tide of violence against women and which has passed a new . law toughening sentences for adults convicted of sex crimes . The attack set off furious protests across India about the treatment of women in the country where police say a rape is reported every 20 minutes. A government panel set to suggest reforms to sexual assault laws rejected calls to lower the age at which people can be tried as adults from 18 to 16. On July 17, India's top court also refused to reduce the age of a juvenile from 18 to 16 years. However, it later agreed to hear a new petition seeking to take the 'mental and intellectual maturity' of the defendant into account and not just age. Four of the teenager's co-accused are still on trial and face the death penalty if convicted. Closing arguments began on August 22 and verdicts are expected within the next fortnight. A fifth accused, the alleged ring-leader, killed himself in his jail cell in March. The defendant could only receive a maximum sentence of three years because he was 17 at the time of the attack . The teenager, who may not be named, was tried as a juvenile because he was 17 at the time of theattack. The maximum penalty that could be imposed by India's Juvenile Justice Board was three years. In January, authorities ruled he was 17, citing school records, which shocked the victim's family and others clamouring for him to face the death penalty. In response to the public outcry after the rape, the government fast-tracked tougher laws against sex crimes, but it resisted calls to change the juvenile law and return the adult age to 16 from 18. India's Supreme Court is currently hearing a petition filed by Subramanian Swamy, an opposition politician and lawyer, that calls for the law to be reinterpreted rather than changed. Swamy wants the 'emotional, intellectual and mental maturity' of juvenile offenders to be assessed when deciding whether to try them as a juvenile, rather than basing the decision on age alone. 'I felt that, with the kind of rape that took place, if (the juvenile suspect) got off lightly it would send a bad signal to society,' Swamy said. He plans to launch an appeal against the verdict reached today if the Supreme Court rules in favour of his petition later this year. The teenager pleaded not guilty to all 13 charges including rape, murder and robbery. His trial was held behind closed doors to protect his identity and media were barred from reporting on any details of the proceedings. During his trial, he has been held at a juvenile detention facility for violent young offenders in Delhi and kept away from other inmates for his safety. The youth left home when he was 11 and got work in a roadside eatery, his mother said in January. In recent years he lived as a semi-vagrant, washing buses and collecting fares, according to a police report. After leaving home, he never returned and his mother said she thought he was dead until police arrested him in connection with the gang rape. Some 33,000 crimes were committed by juveniles in India last year, the highest number in a decade, but there has not been a large spike, according to Home Ministry figures. Juveniles commit a tiny proportion of total crimes in India and far less than other nations such as the United States.","Defendant, 17, given maximum sentence possible under Indian law .

"By . Tracey Cox . It's made headlines around the world - scandalised the US (at least according to Good Morning America) and attracted 1000's of (mostly outraged) comments from you on this website. I am, of course, talking about Sex Box, a new sex talk chat show with a 'spectacularly' quirky twist: three couples will have sex in a box on stage in front of a studio audience, then talk about it afterwards with a panel of experts (I'm one of them.) Contrary to media hype, the box isn't see-through and made of glass or even 'opaque'. It's made of wood. Thick wood. Picture a Scandinavian hut with a glossy, space age design and you're on the right track. The Box: Tracey Cox, flanked by Philip Hodson, left, and Dan Savage, right, are the panel on Sex Box, which is hosted by Mariella Frostrup, front . Inside, it looks like a boutique hotel room. It's soundproof with no cameras, so the couples can't be heard or seen once in there. Not quite the 'live sex' the media has led you to believe, eh? No different, in fact, to what happens any time you book into a motel, share a flat with housemates or turn the key in the front door of your terraced home - people are having sex with only a wall separating you. Yes, it's a cheeky concept. Everyone involved was braced for offence and outrage to be the initial reactions. But it's done for a  reason - to get people to watch a grown-up discussion about sex on mainstream TV. It had to be challenging to attract an audience. We want people to watch it. But whether you tune in to tut-tut or tune in to be educated (the aim of the show), I guarantee if you stick with it for 10 minutes (about the time it takes for the clunkiness of a new format to settle in), you won't just be pleasantly surprised, you'll find it compelling viewing. Here's how it works: while each of the three couples are in the box (with a 30 minute time limit), Mariella Frostup, who hosts the show, international syndicated sex columnist Dan Savage, psychotherapist Phillip Hodson and me, discuss issues relating to the couple in the box. The Couple: Des Lashimba and Lynette Ellis, one of the couples to appear on Sex Box . For example, when our first young couple are in the box, we talk about porn and the effect it has on a generation who have grown up with it. What can be done to keep female desire going long-term - with surprising insights - was a topic debated for our mature couple. Just what gay men really get up to in bed, was the myth-busting eye-opening debate for the gay male couple. The Premise: A couple have sex inside a large box in front of a live studio audience . These discussions are tasteful, intelligent, warm and often funny. They are also educational, challenging harmful sexual myths that confuse and stop lots of people enjoying a healthy, enjoyable sex life. The discussions are so interesting, by the time the couple come out of the box, you'll have forgotten they were in there! When they do emerge - mostly loved up, a little tussled and glowing with a post-coital mix of 'I hope to Christ Aunt Martha's not watching' and 'This is cool - I'm making history here and changing people's attitudes to sex' emotion- they join us for a chat about what they got up to in there. I've never seen a more refreshingly honest, open conversation about what real people do in bed in my life - and I've been studying sex and relationships for the last 25 years. What is it that makes it so extraordinary? The very premise that's causing all the ho-ha: the couples talk about sex immediately after they've finished doing it. We got the idea from sex therapists and educators who sometimes get their clients to talk about sex immediately after they've had it, so their thoughts and issues are fresh in their minds. I expected honesty and a little embarrassment. What I didn't expect was just how tender the couples would be once they came out of the box. It was incredibly sweet to watch them interact and remarkably inspiring. The point of Sex Box isn't just to educate, we're hoping it will encourage couples to start their own conversations about their own  sex lives. Talk about what's working and what isn't. The show will normalise sex for many people watching, surprise even more and hopefully leave all with a more realistic view of what really happens in bedrooms across Britain, rather than what pornography, movies or telly would have us believe. What do you have to lose by giving it a chance and tuning in? Sex Box is on Channel 4 on Mondays at 10pm. It is part of Channel 4's Campaign for Real Sex.

"By . Lydia Warren . and Helen Pow . The birth mother of a baby boy who died after the alleged neglect of his father has spoken out about why she wanted to take her son back from the lesbian couple who had adopted him. Markeya Atkins, 16, took back her son Gabriel in March, three months after Rachel and Heidi McFarland cut his umbilical cord and took him home as their own son. And just weeks later, the boy's teen father, Drew James Weehler-Smith, allegedly left the boy alone at the couple's Des Moines, Iowa apartment. Atkins returned to find him unresponsive and he was later pronounced dead. 'I never thought in my wildest dreams this would happen,' Atkins told WHO-TV on Thursday as she spoke out about her son's death for the first time. Scroll down for video . Loss: Markeya Atkins, 16, has said she couldn't imagine her life without her baby after initially giving him up for adoption. After taking him back, the baby's dad allegedly left him alone and the boy died . She explained that, after discovering she was pregnant five months along, she knew that she wouldn't be able to raise the little boy so decided to give him up for adoption. 'I just thought – the rest of my life – am I really ready to give away the rest of my life for someone,' she said. 'And I just felt like it was the best way to go about it.' But in February, she visited the couple's home and had second thoughts when she saw Rachel kiss the little boy and said 'mommy's here'. She passed back the baby and stormed out, she said. Afterwards, the couple texted Atkins' mother and said she wouldn't be allowed to visit alone without her mother there in the future - which angered Atkins, she said. 'It really hurt my feelings because my mom was not there when I made the baby,' she said. She . made a list of pros and cons about taking her son back and 'couldn't . for the life of me' think why she would want to have him again, she said. Tragic: Rachel and Heidi McFarland, pictured, cared for Gabriel from birth until the middle of March . Loving moms: The McFarlands said they only heard about Gabriel's death on Tuesday on the news . 'When you have a baby it's like this instinct comes on where a part of you just feels like you have something left in this world,' she said. She said that she did not appreciate the adoptive couple telling her that they hoped the tragedy would be a wake-up call for the girl. 'They have no right to talk to me about that,' she said. 'I did absolutely nothing wrong.' Earlier this week, the couple said they were devastated when they learned that the infant they had considered their own had died - while watching the news. 'It's like he's been taken away from you again,' Rachel McFarland told the Des Moines Register. The McFarlands, who have been married five years and together 18, said they are devastated. They had supported the mother financially through her pregnancy and had been with her at every doctor's appointment. The couple said they repeatedly asked Atkins if she wanted to go ahead with the adoption and she said 'yes.' Teen mom: Atkins, 16, took the boy back on March 13, three months after the youngster was born . Adorable: Police have charged Drew James Weehler-Smith of Des Moines with neglect of a dependent person after he left his son, pictured, alone in an apartment on Tuesday . 'We brought him home from the hospital,' Rachel McFarland told the Register. 'I cut his umbilical cord.' She . said from that moment on she spent every waking moment with the baby . until his birth mother reneged on the adoption that was agreed last . September. Heidi even took maternity leave from work. Gabriel . was born deaf in one ear and they . had fitted him for a hearing aid and had planned to learn sign language . so they could communicate with the child in case he lost the hearing in . his other ear. 'It just felt natural. When he was with us it just felt right. Like we were always meant to be moms,' Rachel told WHOTV.com. But, . in Iowa, the birth mother has three months and then one additional . 31-day probationary period to change her mind about giving up her baby. According . to police, the young mom left the baby with Weehler-Smith in an . apartment in the 6500 block of Chaffee Road at about 7.25pm while she . went to the library and to run errands. Scene: According to police, the young mom left the baby with Weehler-Smith in an apartment, pictured, in the 6500 block of Chaffee Road at about 7:25p.m. while she went to the library and to run errands . About 25 . minutes later, a friend dropped into the apartment to collect a phone . charger and saw the father holding the child. She left and called the . mother asking whether she trusted Weehler-Smith. The . Register reported that the mother asked the friend to return to the . apartment but when she pulled in she saw the father driving away without . the baby. She notified the mom, who rushed home and found Gabriel limp and not breathing in a glider chair. He was pronounced dead at hospital. While devastated, the McFarlands are determined not to let the failed adoption and Gabriel's death ruin their lives. 'We're just left to put the pieces back together,' Rachel said. Weehler-Smith could face additional charges pending the results of an autopsy.

"By . Ashley Collman . and Lydia Warren . The two young men at the head of a Philadelphia prep-school drug ring have turned on each other after authorities raided their operation - confiscating pounds of drugs, several weapons and $11,000 in cash. Neil Scott, 25, and his 18-year-old associate Timothy Brooks were arrested as the ringleaders of the 'Main Line Takeover Project' - a drug dealership in suburban Pennsylvania which dealt exclusively in colleges and high schools. While the two once worked closely together to run their illicit business, they have since turned on each other as they . face multiple felony charges. Friendship over: Neil Scott, 25 (left), and Timothy Brooks, 18 (right), are the alleged ringleaders of a Philadelphia drug business. After the two were arraigned last Monday on several felony counts, they turned on each other in statements released by their lawyers . Haul: A raid in February turned up pounds of drugs, several guns and thousands in cash the two men used to run their drug ring in suburban Philadelphia . Sorry: Brooks' lawyer says he was only involved in the drug ring for three months and was 'remorseful' of his behavior. Pictured above being led into court on Monday for an arraignment. He is currently free on $250,000 bond . Partner in crime; However, a lawyer for Scott says Brooks was a drug dealer before he met his client and that Scott never worked with the high school drug dealers. Pictured above on Monday. Scott is still in jail on $1million bail . After the two were arraigned in Montgomery County Court on Monday, their lawyers issued statements defending their clients. Greg Pagano, the attorney for Brooks, told ABC News that his client was only involved in the ring for three months, did not posses any of the weapons and was 'remorseful' for his behavior. 'He suffered an injury as an athlete at his first year of college in the Fall of 2013 requiring him to come home for surgery and to recuperate,' Pagano said. 'He became depressed and was not well physically or mentally. It was during this time period that he became acquainted with the wrong people.' Scott's lawyer Timothy Egan paints a different portrait of Brooks however, saying he was a drug dealer before meeting Scott and the only one who worked directly with the high-school dealers. 'Mr. Scott had no direct relationships with any high school students or any high school drug dealers with regards to any substance - including marijuana,' Egan said. 'The main contact he had with the high school was Mr. Brooks ... and Mr. Brooks already had per-existing ties in at least a few of the high schools.' Scott remains in jail on $1million bail while Brooks is free after his parents posted his $250,000 bail. Both are facing multiple felony  counts including working for a corrupt organization, conspiracy, and possession of a controlled substance. Scott and Neil are graduates of the Haverford School, a $35,000-a-year prep school where they played lacrosse and went on to supply drugs. Good upbringing: Both Scott and Brooks the posh attended Haverford College. A private, nonsectarian, preparatory boys' school outside Philadelphia . Scott . graduated in 2008 and went to Connecticut College, but he dropped out . after three semesters when he was caught smoking pot and making fake . IDs, the Philadelphia Daily News reported. Afterwards, . one of his high school coaches found him a job working for a team in . California, and when that folded in February 2013, another coach in the . state gave him a job on his program. 'He told me there was nothing good at . home,' the coach, Zack Burke, told the Daily News. 'Nothing but drugs and trouble, and he wanted to get . away from it out here.' But Burke said that Scott's attitude . began to change. He added that . he thought Scott began dating a 40-year-old dermatologist who could provide him Xanax and other pills. 'I feel like she made him crazy,' he said. 'I heard he packed up his car and went back to Philly in September.' Likewise, . Brooks headed back to Philadelphia for surgery after suffering a sports . injury after one semester - and he met with Brooks, a fellow Haverford . grad who he knew through lacrosse circles. The pair allegedly bought books about street-smart drug dealers to learn the business. Prosecutors say they then hired . students to peddle the drugs at Lafayette, Gettysburg and Haverford . colleges, and at several suburban high schools. The two named their network 'The Main Line Takeover Project,' investigators said. 'Their . intention, as the name suggests, was the two of them would take over . drug distribution - in particular, marijuana distribution - in schools . and colleges on the Main Line,' District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman . said. 'This was not a game. These people were in business, they were in business to make money and . they were going to do whatever they needed to do so that no one . threatened their business.' Scott would receive bulk shipments from a California supplier which would be shipped to his Haverford apartment, which allegedly served as his base of operations. Ferman said local students would be drafted into the drug distribution operation as sub-dealers to allegedly distribute cocaine, marijuana, hash oil and ecstasy. 'The high school sub-dealers were encouraged to develop their business so they could sell at least one pound of marijuana each week,' Ferman said. Damning evidence: Montgomery County district attorney Risa Vetri Ferman holds a rifle that was part of the drugs, guns, money and other illegal items seized when Lower Merion Police broke up a drug distribution ring . Quite the haul: The duo allegedly set up a drug ring that supplied marijuana and cocaine to schools in Philadelphia's affluent Main Line suburbs. Pictured, a haul of guns, cash and drugs that authorities seized . Brooks - who Ferman said acted as the supervisor of the student dealers - instructed them to make sure there was 'never a drought,' Ferman said. He wanted dealers to make certain there was always a constant supply in the assigned schools. If the dealers met their weekly quota, the incentives included a lower purchase price for marijuana in order to increase their profit margin. Ferman said investigators learned about the 'Main Line Take Over Project' through confidential informants and conducted a one-day round-up in February. In that operation, prosecutors said they confiscated 8 lbs. of marijuana, 3 grams of hash oil, 23 grams of cocaine, 11 grams of Ecstasy, $11,000 in cash, a loaded handgun, an AR-15 assault rifle and AR-15 style rifle. Most of the contraband came from Scott's Haverford apartment, authorities said. Questions: As well as the two ringleaders, Garrett Johnson, 18, (left) and Daniel Mcgrath, 18, (right) were arrested in the investigation. They are both students at Scott and Brooks' former prep school . 'Sub-dealers': Willow Orr, (left), and Domenic Curcio, 29 (right) were also arrested in connection with the ring . 'Involved': Reid Cohen, 18, (left) a high school student, and John Rosemann, 20, (right) a Lafayette student . Investigators found approximately . eight pounds of marijuana, three pounds of hash oil, 23 grams of . cocaine, 11 grams of ecstasy, $11,000 in cash, a loaded AR-15 assault . rifle, a loaded 9mm pistol, and a loaded .22 AR-15 style rifle along . with ammunition for all of those guns. During . the four-month investigation, text messages revealed Scott gave Brooks . advice on how to expand the marijuana sales in high schools, . investigators say. Brooks then supervised sub-dealers who sold marijuana . at local high schools. Ferman says the two men exploited those relationships to help build their drug operation. In addition to Scott and Brooks, seven alleged 'sub-dealers' were also charged. They are: Daniel McGrath, 18, a student at The Haverford School; John Rosemann, 20, a student at Lafayette College; Christian Euler, 23, a graduate of The Haverford School and student at Lafayette College; Garrett Johnson, 18, a student at Haverford College; Reid Cohen, 18, a Haverford College student; Willow Orr, 22; Domenic Curcio, 29. Two juveniles, a 17-year-old Radnor High School student and 17-year-old Lower Merion High School student, have also been petitioned by the DA's office. Lafayette College senior Christian 'Stocky' Euler, a star lacrosse player who attended Haverford with the two ringleaders, was also involved and turned himself into police last Tuesday. Arrest: Christian 'Stocky' Euler, pictured left . and right, has turned himself in to police after he was linked to a drug . ring in Philadelphia.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . Vigilantes are searching an extensive cave system in the hunt for the last fugitive boss of the Knights Templar drug cartel, a ""self-defense"" group leader in western Mexico said Thursday. Vigilante leader Estanislao Beltran said there are signs the cartel had used the caves near the town of Arteaga in Michoacan state. 'I think they used it as a hideout,' said Beltran, who had descended about 100 meters (yards) into the caves. 'We found evidence.' Vigilantes: Groups of armed vigilantes search a cave for cartel leader Servando 'La Tuta' Gomez, a Mexican teacher-turned-drug kingpin . 'Self Defense': Groups of vigilantes calling themselves a 'self defense' group stormed Gomez's hometown of Arteaga last week . Caves: The groups are searching an elaborate system of caves where Gomez is thought to be hiding out . Three days ago, vigilantes accompanied by federal forces took control of Arteaga, which is the hometown of Servando ""La Tuta"" Gomez, the only one of the cartel's top four leaders who has not been captured or killed. Gomez once served as a school teacher in the area and had some support among townspeople because his gang handed out money to residents. Beltran said some townspeople tried to prevent the vigilantes from entering Arteaga to hunt for cartel gunmen, as self-defense groups have down in more than a dozen townships in Michoacan over the last year. But he contended the demonstrators in Arteaga acted under threat from the cartel and said many people were becoming more trustful of the vigilantes. Residents want to get the local iron ore mines re-opened so the area's economy can start again. The government cracked down earlier this year on the Knights Templars' extensive involvement in iron ore exports to China. 'La Tuta': Servando 'La Tuta Gomez, a former teacher, is the alleged leader of the Knights Templar drug cartel . Signs: The vigilantes say that there are signs that the drug cartel has recently used some of the caves . Collaboration: The vigilantes team up with federal police officers in the search for 'La Tuta' The vigilantes sprang up in February 2013 to fight the cartel's extortion demands, kidnappings and killings. Armed with assault rifles, they travel from town to town in pickup trucks and set up highway checkpoints, seeking to expel cartel gunmen from the largely agricultural state. The government is trying to register and reign in the vigilantes, to avoid copy cats and infiltrators, like dozens of members of a rival cartel who were arrested earlier this week in Michoacan wearing vigilante-style T-shirts. The federal government has given the vigilante groups until May 10 to demobilize, which is usually understood as handing in their largest-caliber weapons and ending armed patrols. The government has offered them the option of signing up as members of an army-controlled Rural Defense corps. Robin Hood: Gomez has the support of many in his hometown of Arteaga because he often distributes money to the people living in the town . Last one: Gomez is the only remaining leader of the Knights Templar cartel, as the three others have either been captured or killed . Residents of Arteaga are accusing the man in the white shirt of being a supporter of the cartel, despite his claims siding with the vigilantes . Beltran said other self-defense fighters may become municipal policemen. Many of the state's local cops have been fired or re-assigned, in part because of suspected links to crime gangs. Interior Secretary Miguel Angel Osorio Chong appeared to suggest Thursday the demobilization would entail, as a minimum, that vigilantes leave their guns at home. 'Starting May 10, there cannot be armed people in the streets,' Osorio Chong told a news conference.","Vigilantes last week stormed the Mexican town of Atreaga in search of Servando ""La Tuta"" Gomez .
Gomez is the last remaining leader of the Knights Templar drug cartel who hasn't been either captured of killed .
Prior to being a drug kingpin and international fugitive, Gomez was a school teacher .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Gurbaksh Chahal, the multi-millionaire tech CEO accused of kicking his girlfriend 117 in a frenzied 30 minute attack, has been terminated from his position at leading online ad network RadiumOne following a major backlash about his sentencing. The sacking comes comes after news website TechCrunch dumped RadiumOne as a sponsor of next week's 'Disrupt NY' technology conference, calling Chahal a 'violent, angry man' who had not been held accountable for his actions. The 31-year-old was charged with 45 felony counts for the brutal attack on his girlfriend, which was caught on CCTV footage from cameras in his bedroom, however the evidence was ruled inadmissible in court because police obtained it without a warrant. The victim also stopped cooperating with prosecutors. Chahal then pleaded guilty to one charge of domestic violence battery and one charge of battery and was sentenced to just 25 hours of community service, three years probation and a 52-week domestic violence training course. Sacked! Multi-millionaire tech entrepreneur Gurbaksh Chahal - pictured on the balcony of his San Francisco penthouse  was allegedly filmed hitting and kicking his then-partner 117 times over half an hour. He has now been fired as CEO of ad company RadiumOne . On Saturday night the RadiumOne board of directors terminated Chahal on Saturday night, saying in a statement that Chief Operating Officer Bill Lonergan will be taking over as CEO, according to Re/code. The decision followed an open later that was posted online by Leena Rao, a senior editor at TechCrunch, who said Chahal's actions were unacceptable. 'You see, I am afraid that this world is at risk of being a place where people are known to sacrifice ethics, and values, and sometimes genuine human decency in exchange for making money,' Rao said in the litter, according to The Huffington Post. 'This scares me, as does the fact that a violent, angry man is being left to prosper without full responsibility and retribution for his crimes.' Under Chahal's command, RadiumOne is one of the most powerful online advertising platforms in the world and is expected to generate $100 million in revenue this year. It was set to sponsor the 'Hackathon' portion of the three-day Disrupt technology and startup conference taking place in New York City next week. But after social media erupted with outrage over Chahal's sentencing, it seems RadiumOne has been severely tarnished. But Chahal defended himself on his blog, saying that although his temper 'got the better' of him, 'there is a difference between temper and domestic violence'. He also said his temper was sparked by discovering his girlfriend 'was having unprotected sex for money with other people'. Police were called to Chahal’s Infinity Towers penthouse apartment after a 911-call about domestic violence on August 5, 2013. Chahal, is alleged to have horrifically assaulted his girlfriend - who cannot be identified - over a period of half an hour, while also repeatedly threatening to kill. San Francisco police pulled security footage from Chahal's bedroom and used it to charge him with 45 felony crimes and two misdemeanors. Among the 45 counts were Assault With a Deadly Weapon (not a fire arm), which in this case is cited as a pillow. However, as the court case proceeded, a judge ruled the video inadmissible as the San Francisco Police Department had obtained it without a warrant. Chahal’s girlfriend also withdrew her testimony and refused to cooperate . Self-made: Indian-born Chahal, pictured with president Obama, had made $340million by the time he was 25 after selling his two internet advertising start-ups . Eligible bachelor? Police were called to Chahal's penthouse after a 911-call about domestic violence on August 5, 2013, which later saw him face 45 felony charges based on the CCTV footage taken by cameras in his bedroom . In the end, on April 16, Chahal pleaded guilty to one charge of domestic violence battery and one charge of battery and was sentenced to just 25 hours of community service, three years’ probation and a 52-week domestic violence training course. Despite the incident in August, the recent court case and guilty plea, Chahal remained in his position at RadiumOne, as well as working as a motivational speaker and lecturer. He also continued to publish 'inspirational posts' on his social media channels. These recently included: '15 Things Leaders Never Do', 'If you’re looking for a role model. Don’t look outside, just look inside.' and 'When you want to succeed as bad you want to breathe, then you’ll be successful'. He allegedly smothered his girlfriend for 20 seconds. ‘She stated she was unable to breathe,’ San Francisco Police Officer Anh Nguyen, told the court during a preliminary hearing last month, San Francisco Business Times reports. 'She stated that he said, “I’m going to kill you” four times. She stated she was in fear for her life.’ Indian-born Chahal moved to California with his family when he was four and founded his first start-up in his bedroom after dropping out of high-school. Aged 18 he sold ClickAgents, an online company making revenue from performance-based advertising, for $40million. Four years later, he formed BlueLithium, which was one of the first companies to track users online habits to tailor advertising - a system now found all over the internet. He sold it to Yahoo! in 2007 for $300million in cash. Chahal has also made numerous TV appearances, including a lengthy interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2009, a philanthropic stint on Secret Millionaire and was named America's most eligible bachelor by Extra TV five years ago. His autobiography, released at the age of 27, is called The Dream: How I Learned the Risks and Rewards of Entrepreneurship and Made Millions. The San Francisco District Attorney's Office issued a statement after the guilty plea on Thursday which said: ‘We disagree with the judge’s suppression of the video. The judge’s ruling substantially weakened the evidence we had for prosecution. ‘Though it is not the outcome we had hoped for, the case has reached a resolution where the defendant acknowledges guilt, is placed on domestic violence probation and has to take domestic violence classes.’","Multi-millionaire CEO of RadiumOne, Gurbaksh Chahal, 31, was charged with 45 felony counts relating to an assault on his girlfriend in August .

"By . David Mccormack . President Obama opened up to an audience of students at the University of Malaya on Sunday and confessed that his greatest regret in life has been not spending more time with his mom before her untimely death in 1995. For more than an hour during the town hall-style meeting, young Malaysians questioned the President about a range of issues that tended more towards personal topics rather than a quizzing on the finer points of U.S.-Asian policy. When one student asked Obama about his biggest regrets, the President reflected on his mother Ann Dunham, who died from ovarian cancer in 1995 aged just 52. President Obama opened up to an audience of students at the University of Malaya on Sunday and confessed that his greatest regret in life has been not spending more time with his mom before her untimely death in 1995 . The President answered questions from students at Malaya University during the 80-minute Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia . ‘I regret not having spent more time with my mother,’ said Obama. ‘Because she died early - she got cancer right around when she was my age, actually, she was just a year older than I am now - she died.  It happened very fast, in about six months.’ ‘There was a stretch of time from when I was, let’s say, 20 until I was 30, where I was so busy with my own life that I didn’t always reach out and communicate with her and ask her how she was doing and tell her about things,’ Obama said. 'What you remember in the end, I think, is the people you love,' Obama said near the conclusion of the 80-minute Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. ‘I realized that I didn’t - every single day, or at least more often - just spend time with her and find out what she was thinking and what she was doing, because she had been such an important part of my life.' Barack and his wife Michelle Robinson Obama on their wedding day in 1992 with Marian Robinson, left and his mother Ann Dunham (second from right) Another participant wanted to know about Obama's aspirations as a youngster and whether he had achieved his goals. The President said he hadn't taken his studies as seriously as he should have during his high school years, reports ABC News. He described a rebellious youth stemming from his 'complicated' family life, growing up without a father at home, and 'sometimes I was enjoying life too much.'

Chinese authorities ordered video streaming websites in the country to stop showing four popular American TV shows, including 'The Big Bang Theory' and 'The Good Wife,' representatives from two sites said Sunday. The move suggests government attention is intensifying on the online streaming industry, which is freer than state television and China's cinemas to show foreign productions and other content and has stretched the boundaries of what can be seen in the country. A spokeswoman for a leading online video site, Youku, said it had received notification on Saturday not to show sitcom 'The Big Bang Theory,' political and legal drama 'The Good Wife,' crime drama 'NCIS' and legal drama 'The Practice.' Of those, Youku showed only 'The Good Wife.' Frontpage of Youku, a popular Chinese video streaming site. This site, as well as others, has been ordered to remove several American shows .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A Canadian family whose 17-year-old son was knocked off his bike and killed in 2012 were shocked to discover the driver who hit him plans to sue for $1.35 million. Brandon Majewski had been cycling along a road near his Alcona home with two friends when Sharlene Simon hit them with her SUV, injuring two of them and killing Brandon. Now the 42-year-old is suing Brandon's estate and the 16-year-olds she injured over claims she has suffered emotional trauma, and alleging that the friends were negligent. Loss: Brandon Majewski died after a driver knocked into his bike in October 2012 . Tragic: Floral tributes and a bike have been left at the spot where Brandon was knocked off his bike and killed . The mother-of-three ran into the back of the friends at about 1.30am on October 28, 2012, as they returning home from a coffee shop. She is seeking damages from Brandon's parents, Derek Majewski  and Venetta Mlynczyk, as well as from Richard McLean, who broke his pelvis after being hit by her car, and Jake Roberts, who was also knocked from his bike. The county where the crash happened is also named in the lawsuit for allegedly failing to maintain the road. According to the lawsuit filed at an Ontario court in December, Ms Simon 'sustained and will sustain great pain and suffering her enjoyment of life has been and will be lessened'. 'I’m devastated, I’m in shock,' Ms Mlynczyk told the Toronto Sun. 'She killed my child and now she wants to profit from it? She . says she’s in pain? 'Tell her to look inside my head and she will see . pain, she will see panic, she will see nightmares.' The family's lawyer was also shocked by the lawsuit, and said he was so upset by it he couldn't bear to tell the parents over the phone. Devastated: Brandon, left, with his dad, step mom and siblings, who are still trying to come to terms with his death . Shocking: The driver who ran into Brandon's bike is suing his family for 'emotional trauma' 'I have never seen anyone ever sue a . child that they killed. It’s beyond . the pale. I just couldn’t bring myself to tell them,' Brian Cameron said. In the claim, Simon has asked for $1.35 million in damages for the psychological suffering, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress she says she has suffered since the accident. She alleged that the friends had been negligent, claiming: 'They did not apply their brakes properly. They were incompetent bicyclists.' Her lawyer, Michael Ellis, told Mail Online: 'Ms Simon empathizes with families of the young cyclists for the losses they have sustained as a result of the accident, but she too has been harmed by this event. 'She relives the terror of this incident every day,' he added, explaining that Ms Simon has been unable to return to work since the collision and had post-traumatic stress disorder diagnosed. 'Unfortunately, the cyclists were not riding in a careful and prudent manner. They were riding in the middle of an unlit road at 1:30am,' Mr Ellis said. 'Their bicycles were not properly illuminated, nor did they have the proper reflectors. An independent accident reconstruction completed by law enforcement officials found that there was nothing Ms  Simon could have done to avoid the collision.' He added: 'While everyone should feel sympathy and compassion for the families of the cyclists, we must also remember that there is another family who is hurting as well.' Brandon's father rejects the notion that his son had been negligent, saying: 'They're kids. They have the right to make mistakes.' He added that the bikes all were fitted with reflectors that would have been visible. Claims: The driver has alleged the boys she ran into were 'negligent'. As well as suing Brandon's family, she is seeking damages from the teenagers she injured as well . Traumatic: Six months after Brandon died his older brother Devon, pictured with their mother Venetta, was found dead at their home . Ms Simon's . demands have further compounded the grief for Brandon's family, who are . also mourning the loss of his older brother who died a few months after . the accident. Six . months after Brandon died, the family awoke to find his 23-year-old . brother Devon dead in bed. He had died after taking pills and drinking . alcohol. 'This . has ripped our family apart,' Mr Majewski said 'And now this woman has . the gall to try to profit from our dead child she killed? Profit from . another boy who was almost crippled?' Family lawyer Mr Cameron has made a routine lawsuit against Ms Simon to recoup medical . and funeral costs on behalf of the victims and their families. He alleges . Simon was speeding and may have been intoxicated and talking on her . cellphone. A police report showed she was going at 90km per hour in an 80 zone. 'Sharlene . Simon failed to take reasonable care to avoid a collision which she saw . or should have seen was likely to occur,' his claim states. 'She . operated the motor vehicle while she was intoxicated.' None of the allegations have been tested in court. Ms Simon was not breathalyzed at the scene.","Sharlene Simon is seeking $1.35 million from estate of Brandon Majewski and the two 16-year-olds she injured .

"By . Ryan Gorman . A teen girl was shot dead by police while leaving a field party early Saturday morning and outraged locals are demanding answers. Samantha Ramsey, 19, of Hebron, Kentucky, was shot four times after hitting a Boone County Sheriff’s Office deputy with her car, authorities said. But friends claim Tyler Brockman jumped on the hood of her car and opened fire. Brockman suffered only a leg injury and was placed on administrative leave while the incident is investigated, sources told WLWT. Tragic death: Deputy Tyler Brockman (left) says he shot dead Samantha Ramsey (right) in self defense, but family and friends disagree - he has been placed on leave while the incident is investigated . Shot up: The four bullet holes in the windshield are clearly visible . ‘She lost her life for him jumping on the hood of a young girl’s car,’ friend Gunnar Buemi told the station during a vigil. Buemi became more enraged as the day went on. ‘That's murder!’ He shouted while frantically waving his arms as people cheered him on. ‘Justice needs to be done about this injustice. We're all sitting here lighting candles, being quiet when the government is out here shooting. ‘Any other human would have been put in jail for that. He needs to answer for what he did to that family.’ He was not alone in his outrage. Grieving: Mother Brandi Stewart attended the candlelight vigil and said she wants answers . Write caption here . Outraged: Friend Gunnar Buemi shouted that Ramsey was murdered and called for the cop to be jailed . ‘Just to be shot four times that's excessive,’ friend Lynsy Hall told WXIX. ‘That wasn't right. He could have killed the other three people that were in the car’ One of the girls in the car said the officer used excessive force. ‘The cop was in the wrong,’ Chelsea Pendleton told the Cincinnati Enquirer. ‘I was there. I was in the back seat. That was unnecessary force. He had no right to do that.’ ‘That was dead body weight on the gas pedal after she was shot,’ she added. A large crowd including the slain teen’s mother gathered to light candles on the side of the road. She isn’t angry, but she does want to know what happened. Sad day: The memorial left at the scene of Ramsey's death . ‘I just want to know what happened. I want answers,’ Brandi Stewart lamented to WXIX. ‘He was the last person that looked in my daughter's eyes that saw her face and I want answers.’ The gathering was large enough to close the road, and it brought back memories for one of the passengers in Ramsay’s car when all hell broke loose. ‘After the shots, I ducked down and then we're reversing back into the ditch and we couldn't get out for a second and I opened the door and dropped to my knees and started bawling my eyes out,’ Chelsea Pendleton told WLWT. Authorities have not commented on the shooting other than to say an investigation is ongoing.Her friends and mother are trying to remember her in a better light. It is not yet known if Ramsey had been drinking or doing drugs prior to the incident, police are awaiting toxicology results for confirmation. ‘I wouldn't have expected anything less because she was so loved, you know, she's a good person,’ Stewart added. ‘She loved people, they loved her. She was a people person.’","Samantha Ramsey, 19, was shot four times by a sheriff's deputy as she left a party early Saturday morning .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated Press Reporter . A former ‘Sopranos’ actor who served eight years in prison has revealed he is now using his experience to teach lessons to younger would-be offenders.

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated Press Reporter . The victims of a criminally negligent Georgia mammogram technician are speaking up after the hospital staffer was sent to jail for her evil crimes. Rachael Rapraeger, pleaded guilty . earlier this month to 10 misdemeanor charges of reckless conduct and one . felony charge of computer forgery for signing clean bills of health for at least 10 women that in reality had breast cancer. She was sentenced to serve up to six . months in a detention center, to serve 10 years on probation during . which she can't work in the health care field and to pay a $12,500 fine. Sent to jail: Rachael Michelle Rapraeger, right, sits with her attorney, Floyd Buford, during a sentencing hearing - she pleaded guilty this month to 10 charges related to falsifying mammogram results . Sharon Holmes found a lump in her left breast quite by accident. At work one day as a high school custodian, her hand brushed up against her chest and she felt a knot sticking out. She was perplexed. After all, just three months earlier, she had been given an all-clear sign from her doctor after a mammogram. A new mammogram in February 2010 showed she in fact had an aggressive stage 2 breast cancer. The horror of the discovery was compounded by the reason: The earlier test results she had gotten weren't just read incorrectly. They were falsified. She wasn't alone in facing this news. The lead radiological technologist at Perry Hospital in Perry, a small community about 100 miles south of Atlanta, had for about 18 months been signing off on mammograms and spitting out reports showing nearly 1,300 women were clear of any signs of breast cancer or abnormalities. Except that she was wrong. Holmes and nine other women were later shown to have lumps or cancerous tumors growing inside them. Holmes said the discovery was horrific enough. With a son in his 20s and another in high school at the time, she trembled at the thought of leaving them without a mother. 'To me, that meant a death sentence,' she said. She underwent successful surgery the month after the cancer was discovered to remove the lump from her breast and followed that with chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Facing her accuser: Rachael Michelle Rapraeger, center, sits with her attorney, Floyd Buford, after Sharon Holmes, left, read her statement to a Houston County Superior Court, in Perry, Georgia earlier this month . Her breast has been cancer-free for four years and subsequent cancers found elsewhere, in her lymph nodes and thyroid, have been successfully treated. Now she just prays it doesn't come back. But to find out later that she had been deceived made it even worse. 'I'm thinking I'm doing what I'm supposed to do, getting my tests done, and then I find out someone else isn't doing their job,' Holmes said. The reasons she gave were vague. She told police she had personal issues that caused her to stop caring about her job, that she had fallen behind processing the piles of mammogram films that stacked up. So she went into the hospital's computer system, assumed the identities of physicians, and gave each patient a clear reading, an investigative report says. That allowed her to avoid the time-consuming paperwork required before the films are brought to a reading room for radiologists to examine, her lawyer Floyd Buford said. Her actions were uncovered in April 2010 after a patient who'd received a negative report had another mammogram three months later at another hospital that revealed she had breast cancer. As hospital staff began to investigate, it was determined that the doctor whose name was on the faulty report had not been at the hospital the day the report was filed. Rapraeger quickly confessed to her supervisor that she was responsible and was fired from her job about a week later, according to an investigator's report. Victimized: Miriam W Mizell (top), pictured with relatives Jaime Wall (left), James Wall VI (bottom center)) and James Wall V (right) Rapraeger told police she knew what she was doing wasn't right, but that she didn't consider the consequences until she realized a patient with cancer had been told her scan was clear. She didn't return a phone call from The Associated Press seeking comment. Her attorney said she feels great remorse about any pain that she caused. Cary Martin, CEO of Houston Healthcare, which operates Perry Hospital, released a statement saying he is 'pleased this component of Ms. Rapraeger's unfortunate action is concluded' and declined to comment further. Sara Bailey also received a false-negative report. By the time it was discovered, her breast cancer progressed to the point that doctors had to remove her entire breast rather than just going in and removing a lump, she said. The surgery was successful and the cancer hasn't returned, but Bailey carries a bitterness inside her that surfaces when she talks about her experience. 'I'm not hurting and I don't think I have cancer, but I'm not a woman anymore,' the 80-year-old said, her eyes welling with tears and her voice catching as she talked about the loss of her breast. The emotional wound was opened again this month when Rapraeger received a sentence that Bailey saw as a slap on the wrist. 'I feel like we were thrown under the bus, and there will be an election day,' Bailey said, explaining that she plans to organize an effort to get Houston Judicial Circuit District Attorney George Hartwig voted out of office. Hartwig said he understands how Bailey feels and knows some people think Rapraeger got off easy, but he said his office weighed the evidence in the case very carefully and concluded the plea was a fair outcome. Even though Rapraeger did make statements and admissions to police, they were too general to prove specific instances of wrongdoing, he said. 'Given the entirety of the case and the issues that were there, I really feel like we did the best we could do to get a measure of justice for these women,' he said, adding that it would have been even more disappointing if the case had gone to trial and she'd been found not guilty and walked out of there with no penalty. For her part, Holmes, 49, has tried to move on, and testifying at Rapraeger's sentencing helped with that. 'I wanted her to know I'm a person, not just a name on a paper,' she said. While recovering: Miriam Mizell pictured with her son in 2010 . But she's still angry because lingering effects from her chemotherapy and radiation â€” treatments she said her doctors told her might not have been necessary if the cancer had been caught by the original mammogram â€” have kept her from returning to work as a high school janitor. Like Bailey, she thought Rapraeger's sentence was too light, and she was disappointed that Rapraeger didn't speak in court, instead letting her attorney read a statement for her. 'If she had gotten up and at least said, 'I'm sorry for what I did. I'm sorry these women had to go through this,' that, to me, would have meant that she was truly sorry for what we went through,' Holmes said. Mary Brown had a mammogram in August 2009. She was contacted by the hospital in May 2010 and told to come back for another. That one came back positive, and she had a mastectomy to remove her right breast. She considers herself lucky that she apparently had a slow-growing cancer and didn't need to have chemotherapy or radiation. Brown, a 78-year-old Jehovah's Witness, credits her strong faith in God with helping her get through the ordeal and with helping her forgive Rapraeger. 'I don't have any hard feelings about her. Whatever she did, she brought it on herself,' Brown said, though she conceded her relative good fortune might also be coloring her reaction. 'Maybe if I had been dying sick from it I would feel different.'","Technician Rachael Rapraeger, pleaded guilty earlier this month to 10 misdemeanor charges .

"By . Ryan Gorman . A decades-long feud between two Chicago families boiled over ended with an off-duty police officer shooting dead an elderly man who shot the cop's wife. Joe Huff, 86, is dead and both Hazel Jones, 85, and Cathryn Anthony, 58, were taken to a hospital with gunshot wounds Saturday afternoon. They are expected to survive. Police say the unnamed off-duty cop opened fire after Huff shot his wife with a shotgun and then Jones reached for it, but relatives of the slain man and neighbors say Anthony has a history of problems in the South Side neighborhood. Gunned down: Joe Huff was shot dead after opening fire on an off-duty police officer's wife . ‘I'm dreaming right now,’ grieving granddaughter Ebony Huff told WMAQ. ‘My grandfather's not dead. He's been in to it with these people next door to him for years. ‘He has paperwork against these people.’ Problems started about 2.15 p.m. between Jones and Anthony, with the older woman throwing dirt and rocks at the officer’s wife and striking her with a broom, cops said. The officer saw Huff go outside and return with a shotgun, firing shots into her arm and head, according to police. ‘Fearing for his life and the life of his wife the officer discharged his weapon striking the male offender,’ the department said. Devastated: Ebony Jones, Huff's granddaughter, cries hysterically at the scene of her grandfather's death . Jones then reached for the shotgun while being told not to by Anthony’s husband, leaving him little option but to shoot her as well. She was struck in the hand and leg. Huff was pronounced dead at the scene, Anthony is in stable condition at a local hospital and Jones was treated for her wounds and released, officials said. ‘The minute a shotgun gets involved and somebody pulls the trigger it goes from being a simple dispute to a tragedy,’ a police official told WMAQ. Both families have lived on the same block since at least the late 1960s, according to neighbor Judith Blake. Anthony’s husband moved into the home about 10 years ago, and things seemingly escalated from there. On the scene: Investigators swarmed the block shortly after the Saturday afternoon shooting . ‘The police and his wife are always messing with the {Huffs],’ Blake told MailOnline. ‘Every time I look up they are arguing.’ Blake says the Anthonys routinely sprayed the Huffs’ property with water, shoveled snow in front of their driveway and constantly argued. ‘Who's in the grass, don't step in my yard... it's been ongoing, nothing that just happened today,’ the officer’s niece, Linda Anthony, told the station. Blake said she personally never had any problems with either family, but said Anthony ‘is always doing some conniving thing to people’ and is constantly arguing with others. She could not recall the Huff family having any similar issues with neighbors. A police spokesperson declined to say if charges would be filed against any of the individuals involved and said the investigation remains ongoing.","Joe Huff, 86, was shot dead by an off-duty police officer during an altercation with the cop's wife .

After driver Joey Logano made some clutch moves in the final laps to take the top spot at the Richmond International Raceway, in Richmond, Virginia, Ambrose and Mears began a heated exchange of words in a garage area of the raceway. Ambrose and Mears, who placed 18th and 19th in the race, began shoving each other as tensions mounted. That's when Ambrose struck Mears with a right hook to the face, knocking the cap off of his head. The men then proceeded to engage each other before the fight was quickly broken up by witnesses. While there was no official reason given for the altercation between the drivers, a tweet by Sporting News speculated that the fight was born from contact between both drivers near the end of the race.

However, he left the possibility open that a full review could reveal more. More...

Post-race controversy in Richmond was not limited to the Ambrose-Mears fight. In addition, Logano's victory was contested by other racers behind him,  with allegations by driver Brad Keselowski, a member of Logano's team, that dirver Matt Kenseth intentionally ran him off of the road, to prevent him from winning. 'I had a shot at winning the race and felt like he ran me off the track,' said Keselowski of Kenseth. Kenseth denied any sabotage on his part. These allegations echoed the Clint Bowyer controversy of last year, when it was discovered after the Richmond race that he intentionally spun out his vehicle to prevent another driver from winning, as well as his own teammate from being competitive for a playoff spot. While full blown punches have not been common between at-odds NASCAR . drivers, the sport has had a recent history of drivers taking out their . frustrations on each other. In 2013, Logano was involved in a tussle with driver Tony Stewart at the end of the Auto Club 400, in Fontana, California. In another 2013 fight, driver Nelson Piquet, Jr. kicked Brian Scott in the groin. This fight also occurred at the Richmond International Raceway. After the conclusion of the Toyota Owners 400, Ambrose, who drives for Richard Petty Motorsports, is ranked 16th in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Standings.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Scroll down for video . Elegant and charming, an 18th-century painting shows two young, upper-class women who smile daintily on a rural background. These two slender figures, clad in sumptuous clothing and wearing pearls round their necks, would be utterly typical for the period - except for the fact that one of them is black. The mysterious picture seems to show the two women as equal, despite hailing from an era of huge racial prejudice, when Britain still bought and sold Africans in a booming slaving industry. Intriguing: This 1779 portrait, by Johann Zoffany, shows Dido Elizabeth Belle, seemingly the equal of her playmate Lady Elizabeth Murray . And now, rather than being an oddity, it has emerged that Dido Elizabeth Belle - the poised, dark-skinned figure in the portrait - could have played an instrumental part the United Kingdom's historic move to abolish the slave trade for good. Miss Belle, who was taken in by an influential judge and raised almost like one of his family, could have helped sway the mind of her guardian in a landmark series of legal cases which found against avaricious slavers, and helped to end the trade for good. The director of a new film - Belle - depicting her unusual life has spoken of the influence Miss Belle must have had over William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield, who looked after her. Legal champion: William Murray, 1st Early of Mansfield, ruled against slavers in a series of rulings . Lord Mansfield, who was Lord Chief Justice (one of the country's most senior judges), took Belle in at the request of his nephew, her father - and went on to make landmark rulings against slave traders, which set the stage for the abolitionist movement. Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, Amma Asant, the director of Belle, said: 'I think it would be disingenuous to believer her presence in the house didn't have some impact on him. It makes or a fascinating story to think that his love for his child opened his eyes.' The film, which is released in the UK this June, was inspired by the intriguing portrait, which shows Miss Belle posing with her playmate, Lady Elizabeth Murray, a contemporary who was also under Lord Mansfield's care. Miss Belle, born in 1761, was the illegitimate daughter of Lord Mansfield's nephew, John Lindsay, who was a respected captain in the Royal Navy. Her mother is thought to have been an African slave who was captured from a Spanish trip while Mr Lindsay was serving in the West Indies. She was placed into Lord Mansfield's care as a child, and was raised at Kenwood House in Hampstead, North London, where her presence shocked well-to-do visitors. One outraged visitor, a governor of Massachusetts, then a British colony, wrote an astonished diary entry, noting that Lord Mansfield has been 'reproached for shewing a fondness for her.' Big screen: A new film, called Belle, will tell her unusual story. Gugu Mbatha-Raw, pictured above in character, plays Miss Belle . Indeed, Miss Belle was allowed to lead a relatively privileged life - although she did not eat with the family - and married a junior lawyer. Lord Mansfield's will would eventually confirm her freedom. But it was while under his care as a child, and later a young woman, that Lord Mansfield struck two major blows against the slave trade. The first, in 1772, was part of a series of wrangles about the legal status of slavery, which had been tolerated and accepted by courts despite the lack of an actual law to make slave-owning legal. High-class: Miss Belle was raised at Kenwood House in North London, where visitors were shocked at her presence . Lord Mansfield declared that it was in fact illegal for a slave owner to force a reluctant slave to leave the country with him. He said that the fact that slave-master relationships were commonplace was not a good enough reason - and left open the possibility that owners may have no legal rights over their slaves at all. Later, in 1781, he made another ruling which threw out an a claim by slave ship owners who threw men and women overboard to drown, then tried to claim their value back on insurance. But Lord Mansfield ruled that the owners of the Zong - a slave ship travelling from Africa to America - had been wrong to jettison the slaves in the hope of claiming their value back, and described the condition of slavery as 'odious' in his judgment. The case - closely watched by Abolitionist campaigners - helped fuel the movement to end the slave trade, which was eventually outlawed by Parliament in 1807. In 1833 a further law was passed freeing all existing slaves.","Dido Elizabeth Belle was daughter of Royal Navy captain and African slave .

"By . Darren Boyle . The court heard that Slavica Ecclestone, right, has been paying her ex-husband Bernie, left, £90 million a year since their divorce in 2009 . Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone is being paid £60 million a year by his ex-wife Slavica as part of their 2009 divorce, court documents have shown. Details of the divorce emerged during Mr Ecclestone's trial in Munich where he is accused of  paying a German banker a £27.5 million bribe. German prosecutors claim that Mr Ecclestone paid Gerhard Gribkowsky who was in charge of selling shares in F1 on behalf of Bayern LB bank. The payment, prosecutors allege was to guarantee that the 47 percent share in the F1 business was sold to Mr Ecclestone's preferred bidder CVC Capital partners for £685 million. The details were included in a 256-page indictment which show that Mr Ecclestone has received £300 million from his ex-wife since the split. The indictment, reported by the Sunday Telegraph said: 'Since his divorce from his wife, the accused has received payments on the basis of the British decree nisi. 'The payments amount to around $100 million a year. The duration of the payments from the divorce decree is not known.' Prosecutors claim that the payments come from an off-shore trust established by Mr Ecclestone in 1997 in the name of his then-wife Slavica and their two daughters Tamara and Petra. Mr Ecclestone set up the Liechtenstein based trust fund after he suffered a heart scare to protect his wife, who was not living in the UK for long enough for tax purposes, from paying inheritance and capital gains tax in the event of his death. The 83-year-old billionaire, second from right, appeared in court in Munich on Thursday where he is facing charges of bribing a German banker with £27.5 million over the sale of shares in Formula One . Mr Ecclestone, pictured, denies the charges and insists that banker Gerhard Gribkowsky was blackmailing him . Mr Ecclestone's lawyers claim that banker Gerhard Gribkowsky threatened to inform UK tax authorities about the Bambino trust using false information. It is believed that Slavica Ecclestone, right, has paid £300 million to her ex-husband Bernie, right, since their 2009 divorce . The Forumla One boss admits that he paid Gribkowsky £27.5 million, not as a bribe but because he was being blackmailed by the banker. Mr Ecclestone's lawyers read a four-hour long statement at the start of his trial on Thursday, which is expected to last until September. The trial is only sitting for one or two days a week in order for Mr Ecclestone to continue with his Formula One duties. In the statement, Mr Ecclestone rejected any suggestions that he had bribed the banker and said he was 'grateful' to be able to tell his own side of the story. If convicted of bribery and incitement to breach of trust charges, the billionaire faces up to 10 years in prison. Gribkowsky is currently serving an eight-year jail term for taking the cash. Prosecutors claim that Gribkowsky was in charge of selling a 47 percent share in Formula One held by Munich bank Bayern LB. They allege that Mr Ecclestone paid Gribkowsky the cash so the bank would sell their share of the Formula One business to the billionaire's preferred bidder, CVC Capital Partners for £685 million.

Mr Ecclestone's lawyers, pictured, read a prepared four-hour long statement by the billionaire denying the bribery allegations . The court case will only run one or two days a week so Mr Ecclestone can continue his work with Formula One . During his personal statement to the court, Mr Ecclestone said the trust fund was owned and controlled by his ex-wife and two daughters. He said that he did not own the trust fund and if Gribkowsky had approached UK tax authorities he could have faced a tax bill which he would not have been able to pay. He said: 'From today's point of view, it was not a rational decision. I saw my life's work in danger.' Mr Ecclestone revealed that he has not owned any part of the Formula One series since 1997 although he still runs the day-to-day business. He insisted that he had been 'blackmailed' by Gribkowsky claiming 'the alleged bribe has not occurred'. Mr Ecclestone said it was cheaper to pay Gribkowsky than fight his untrue allegation.","Formula One boss Bernie Eccelstone divorced Slavica in 2009 .

"By . Nikki Murfitt . It was the greatest party London had ever seen. As jubilant crowds flocked on to the streets to celebrate the end of the Second World War in Europe, few noticed a young Princess Elizabeth and her sister Margaret dancing incognito among them. But while the future Queen did indeed do the conga through The Ritz hotel in Piccadilly, a new film is set to claim she also danced in sleazy Soho nightclubs – and ended the night being kissed by a dashing young RAF Lancaster gunner. Girls Night Out is bound to raise eyebrows as, in real life, Princess Elizabeth, then 19, was besotted by Prince Philip, who was serving in the Far East with the Royal Navy. Rebellious? Sarah Gadon (centre) as Princess Elizabeth in Girls Night Out with her sister Princess Margaret (Bel Powley) and her father George VI (Rupert Everett) The real Royals: Princess Elizabeth, Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother), George VI and Margaret . The film, which stars Rupert Everett as King George VI, Emily Watson as Queen Elizabeth, Sarah Gadon as Princess Elizabeth and Bel Powley as Margaret, recounts the dramatic events on VE Day – May 8, 1945. According to the ‘fairytale’ account by Kevin Hood and Trevor de Silva, after Elizabeth and Margaret, then 15, join in the fun at The Ritz, the younger Princess slips away from her guards and hops on a bus. ‘Princess Elizabeth has a race against time to find her,’ says Mr Hood, who was also responsible  for BBC drama Silent Witness and the Jane Austen biopic Becoming Jane. ‘When she gets on a London bus – something she has no clue how to use – she meets an RAF serviceman who comes to her rescue. ‘He is a Lancaster gunner who has had a pretty tough time of it and debates whether he is going to go AWOL or will return to his base  the next morning. Royal show: Sarah Gadon (Queen Elizabeth II) (R) and Bel Powley ( Princes Margaret)  (L) spotted filming scenes from Girls Night Out in Hull . In their finest: Margaret, played by Bel, wore a fur trimmed pink coat with Elizabeth pictured to her left . Celebrations: VE Day was a public holiday which saw thousands take to the streets to party . As they try to  find Margaret, they end up in a couple of sleazy Soho nightclubs. She does help him and as a consequence of that her real identity  is revealed.’ With filming already under way at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire and Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire, Mr Hood admits the decision about whether the future queen will be shown sharing a romantic kiss with the young gunner is under debate. Indeed, film companies Lionsgate and Ecosse, which produced the critically acclaimed Mrs Brown – about the relationship between Queen Victoria and her manservant John Brown – plan to shoot alternative endings and will not make a decision on which to include until closer to the film’s release date next year. While Mr Hood insists the film will be ‘a respectful’ retelling of an event which had huge importance in the Queen’s life, some Palace watchers are less impressed. Royal biographer Penny Junor said: ‘If it’s pure fiction it’s not a good idea. A film that mixes fact and fiction is a  cop-out. They’ve taken liberties.’ But Ingrid Seward, editor of Majesty magazine, said: ‘With the success of The Queen’s Speech and The Queen, it is a good time to do a bit of Royal movie-making. 'Margaret' was pictured walking past what appeared to be a makeshift butcher during filming in Hull . Party Princess: Before Prince Harry there was Margaret - who attended many a party in her time . Leading ladies: Sarah Gadon (L) plays Elizabeth while Bel Powley (R) is younger sister Margaret . Celebrations: Londoners on VE Day in 1945. May 8 was the day the capital turned into a giant party . ‘The fact that the makers are debating whether Princess Elizabeth should be kissed show me  they are very conscious of how they portray the story. There has to be a bit of poetic licence.’ In her diary entry, Elizabeth wrote of the night: ‘Cheered parents on balcony. Up to St James’s Street Piccadilly, great fun. 'We walked through the streets, a line of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall, swept along on a tide of happiness.’ The sisters returned to the Palace in the early hours having maintained their anonymity, but were so caught up in the excitement that they ventured out again the next day. Elizabeth’s diary for May 9 says: ‘Trafalgar Square, Piccadilly, Pall Mall, walked simply miles. Saw parents on balcony at 12.30am – ate, partied, bed 3am!’ Looking back at their adventure, the Queen’s cousin Margaret Rhodes, who acted as their chaperone on VE Day, admitted: ‘It was a unique burst of personal freedom.  A Cinderella moment in reverse in which they could pretend they were ordinary and unknown.’ However, she never mentioned a kiss. A day to remember: More than a million people took to the streets including in London's Piccadilly Circus .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated Press Reporter . An Oregon man's family watched helplessly as a rogue wave swept out to sea while he was attempting to perform a tightrope walk Thursday between two rock formations, authorities said. James Michael Alejanddo, 25, of Portland, went missing near Pacific City after a wave hit him as he made his way over the rough seas. He was not wearing any kind of safety equipment. Witnesses say he was briefly seen in the ocean but they lost sight of him. He has not been seen since. Where it happened: Alejandro was swept out to sea tightrope walking between cliffs at Cape Kiwanda, on the northern coast of Oregon . Alejandro was climbing on a rocky area of Cape Kiwanda with several others Thursday afternoon when he connected a single rope between two large rock sections above the water and tried to walk it. He attempted to make the daring walk without the benefit of a secondary line or harness, sources told The Oregonian. Authorities believe he was with family members. A Coast Guard boat and helicopters searched by water and air but didn't find Alejandro. The search is expected to continue for at least the weekend. Authorities caution that coastal ocean currents are strong and large waves are common in the area, they often take people by surprise.","James Alejandro, of Portland, hasn't been seen since Thursday .

"By . Ryan Gorman . The vintage Chevrolet Corvettes destroyed earlier this year in a sinkhole may never be restored, the museum that owns them has announced. Workers have only recently pulled the last of eight cars from the sinkhole which opened up February 12 at the National Corvette Museum, in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and swallowed them whole. Crews have not even begun any repair work on the recovered sports cars, a museum official told CNN, and may never repair as many as half of them. Decimated: This 2001 custom-made Z06 was turned into a 'pancake' by the sinkhole . Before: The super car was able to hit 175 mph prior to be swallowed by the sinkhole . Before: A 1991 ZR-1 Spider owned by GM - no more than 12 were ever built . Unrecognizable: One would have to have previously known this car is a Corvette to correctly identify it . ‘The last three or four cars that came out of the sinkhole ... we didn't expect them to come out looking quite that bad,’ Dana Forrester, lead Corvette restoration member of the museum's board of directors, told the network. The last car was pulled from the pit on April 9, according to Forrester. Among the wrecked automobiles is a custom-made Vette that was able to hit 175 mph before it was reduced to ‘just a tire.’ Museum officials will meet with veteran car restoration experts and a crew from General Motors to decide what can be done. ‘We'll listen to what they say about it, and then we'll make a decision as to which car gets restored and to what degree,’ he said. Sinkhole: The cars were destroyed when the ground opened up underneath and swallowed them whole . Caked in mud: This is what is left of the one millionth Corvette ever made - a 2009 model . A real looker: What the milestone auto looked like before being crushed . Both the museum and GM, Chevrolet’s parent company, vowed back in February to work to restore the cars to their former glory, but there appears to have been a change of heart. ‘Recent discussions have changed what the original thoughts were,’ Forrester explained, adding that it ‘may not be possible’ to make some of the cars whole again. Those that are restored may not even have all original parts like they did before the tragedy, Forrester further explained. ‘I don't believe they'll go that far.’ Shattered: This 1993 40th anniversary car suffered serious damage, but is likely fixable . Showroom shine: How it looked brand new . Ones that do receive the full treatment, including a tuxedo black 1962 model, might need to be restored by an independent expert. ‘It may be best that there's some other restorer to do it,’ said Forrester. ‘I know GM's got the expertise to go back and take the [two] cars they still own and work on them to a certain degree, but as far as structural work ... I don't know.’ The museum is currently displaying the wrecked cars, which one expert referred to as ‘pancakes’ in comments to CNN, while deciding how to proceed fixing them and the hole. It appears to be working. Attendance has risen 50 per cent since the sinkhole formed, according to Forrester. So have donations - to the tune of $75,000.","About half of the eight destroyed cars are not considered salvageable .

"By . Aaron Rasmussen . Like many teen boys in Beirut, Lebanon, Mohammad el-Shaar had hoop dreams. The gregarious 16-year-old 'once signed a basketball with his name and he gave it to his mom,' el-Shaar’s friend, Omar Bekdash, 18, tells MailOnline in an exclusive interview. 'He told her, ""You keep this because someday I’m going to be famous.'"" On December 27, 2013, el-Shaar got his wish — but for all the wrong reasons. Scroll down for video . Tragic photobomb: Lebanese student Omar Bekdash (right) thought the selfie he took of himself with his friends would capture a great day out with pals. Instead it captured the moments before a horrific explosion. A bomb planted in the gold SUV on the top left of the photo killed his best friend Mohammed el-Shaar (wearing a red hoodie) Hoop dreams: Mohammad, with his mother Nasma at left, had hopes of becoming an NBA star. Before he was killed, he gave her a signed basketball and told her 'You keep this because some day I'm going to be famous' Early that bright Friday morning, Bekdash and Rabih Yousef, 17, picked up el-Shaar and 18-year old Ahmad Moughrabi. The four were on break from school and looking for a way to spend the day. 'We decided to go grab a cup of coffee and have a jog afterward,' says Bekdash of their plan. The group drove to an upscale section of downtown Beirut to get their coffees before heading to a nearby plaza filled with fountains and outdoor seating in the shadow of the Starco building, a Swiss-designed complex refurbished after the 15-year Lebanese civil war ended in 1990. 'Mohammad was talking about his family, about his brother and his mom,' says Bekdash. 'We were reminiscing about the time before his little brother came into this world and how afterwards everything changed.' Deadly attack: Lebenese men place Mohammad on a stretcher following the car bomb explosion that rocked central Beirut on December 27, 2013. The huge explosion also killed Mohamad Chatah, former finance minister . Their serious conversation turned light when Bekdash took out his phone. He wanted to record their day with a selfie and post the image to Snapchat, a popular mobile app that broadcasts pictures to friends. 'The guys always take selfies, so this time I decided I would take one,' says Bekdash. The photo captured the looks of quiet amusement on his buddies’ faces — Bekdash closest to the camera on the right and the usually active el-Shaar sitting uncharacteristically still in a red sweatshirt between Moughrabi and Yousef. Only later would anyone notice the significance of the golden SUV tucked in the upper-left side of the frame. It was forgettable background scenery in an innocuous selfie focused on friends just hanging out. It was also a ticking time bomb, which officials estimate was packed with 50 to 60 kilograms of explosives. Moments after Bekdash uploaded his photo, the shock of a huge blast knocked the phone from his hand and all four boys toppled as fragments of glass and other shrapnel hurled in every direction. Heartbroken: Mohammad's parents and his two brothers are devastated over the the brutal death and loss. 'May ur soul rest in peace our Angel,' his mother Nasma wrote on his Facebook page . 'It took a few seconds to realize that it was an explosion because we saw ash and smoke and shrapnel flying everywhere,' Bekdash says of the initial blast, which he notes sounded like fireworks and felt like being shoved and hit over the head. 'As soon as I fell on the ground, I bounced back up to my feet and started running immediately,' recalls Bekdash. When he got far enough away from the blast site, Bekdash stopped. Only then did he become aware of the bits of glass speckling his leg, leaving him in excruciating pain. 'I wanted to go back but I couldn’t walk, so I sat on a curb,' he explains. 'I couldn’t find anyone. I just saw black smoke everywhere.' Big brother: Mohammad and his siblings were very close. He was talking about his family in those fateful moments before the car bomb ended his life . Bekdash finally spotted Yousef running towards him, panicked and crying. 'He was yelling that Mohammad is dead and he’s on the ground with blood around him,' he says. An ambulance rushed Bekdash and Moughrabi to the American University of Beirut Medical Center while Yousef went to the home of nearby relatives, since he wasn’t as badly injured. Bekdash, who required stitches to his leg, face and head, had no idea what to tell el-Shaar's parents after they arrived to the hospital, begging to know if their child was alive. 'I tried to keep my hopes up and convince myself that he was going to be okay, and that I was going to see him again as soon as he got well,” says Bekdash. “Deep down I knew there was no hope of him coming back to us.' Zest for life:  Mohammad was an athletic teen who wasn't shy about hugigng his friends and telling them how special they were. 'I tried to keep my hopes up and convince myself that he was going to be okay, and that I was going to see him again as soon as he got well,' says Bekdash . He was right. Two days later el-Shaar became the seventh person to die in the blast that reportedly targeted — and killed — Mohamad B. Chatah, a former finance minister. Chatah, 62, was an important adviser to Saad Hariri, leader of the main Sunni party, the Future bloc, as well as a vocal critic of another of Lebanon’s powerful parties, the Shiite-backed militia, Hezbollah. Today the three surviving friends don’t exhibit many physical scars from their horrific experience, but the emotional trauma they suffered in the blast is still bubbling beneath the surface. 'I can’t stand to look at the picture because I cringe and I get flashbacks,' says Bekdash of the selfie he took that December morning. And, like el-Shaar before he died, Bekdash understands his future isn’t in this tiny Mediterranean country that's struggling to deal with the internal strife and side-effects from the ongoing conflicts in neighboring Syria. Rest in peace: A portrait of 16-year-old Mohammad is seen during a candle-light vigil at the site of a car bomb that killed the teen with so much talent . 'Even before the explosion, I knew that the situation would never ever get better,' he explains, 'and every one of us [who was] there at the explosion dreams to get out of here and have a family outside of Lebanon. We know that there are a lot of confrontations between two political parties and people like Mohammad have to pay for it every time.' Now Bekdash just wants people to remember that his friend Mohammad, an athletic teen who wasn’t shy about hugging friends and telling them how special they were, deserves to be celebrated for who he was — instead of what happened to him. 'It’s sad that he got famous from his death and not from his achievements,' says Bekdash. 'I’m really convinced that if he had lived on he would have achieved huge results from the things he would have done.' And the el-Shaar family can only imagine whether or not their boy could have realized his dream of becoming a renowned NBA star. 'His mom is heartbroken because she has been looking everywhere for that ball he signed, and she can’t find it,' says Bekdash. 'But she won’t stop searching.'","Lebanese student Mohammad el-Shaar was hanging out with his friends when a car bomb mortally wounded the outgoing 16-year old .

"By . Neil Sears . A matter of trust: British president and CEO of Formula One racing Bernie Ecclestone and his ex-wife Slavica . Bernie Ecclestone is accused today of avoiding a potential £1billion-plus tax bill after the UK tax authorities scrapped an inquiry in return for just £10million. But the secret deal could now be overturned – and Formula One supremo Mr Ecclestone, 83, could again face a colossal tax bill – thanks to associated claims that his ex-wife Slavica mysteriously pays him £60million a year. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs last night refused to discuss the allegation that it spent nine years probing the tycoon's affairs and links with offshore family trusts before quietly reaching an agreement. But the case focuses a fresh spotlight on complaints that the taxman is all too ready to agree 'sweetheart deals' with the super-rich and big businesses. Last night Shadow Attorney General Emily Thornberry called for a new investigation into Mr Ecclestone and his family trusts by HMRC, saying that £10million was insignificant compared to potential tax bills. Mr Ecclestone refused to answer detailed questions about his tax affairs but insisted that he had always paid his fair share and denied any wrongdoing. His tangled financial affairs are under scrutiny in a German court where he is charged with giving banker Gerhard Gribkowsky a £27million bribe to ensure Formula One shares were sold to a company which supported Mr Ecclestone. Gribkowsky has already been jailed for eight and a half years over the cash, half of which appeared to have come from Mr Ecclestone, and half from the family trusts. Crucially, fabulously wealthy sports mogul Mr Ecclestone admits making a huge payment, but denies it was a bribe, instead claiming he was being blackmailed by Gribkowsky. The banker, he says, was threatening to make untrue allegations to HMRC which could have cost him a fortune. His potential tax bill hinges on offshore family trusts established by Mr Ecclestone in 1996, when he handed over ownership of his Formula One holdings. The trusts – which have links to tax havens including Liechtenstein, Jersey, and elsewhere offshore – reputedly contain several billion pounds in profits from TV rights sales, from which the HMRC has received nothing in tax payments. Mr Ecclestone last week told the Munich court he created the trusts legitimately to avoid ultimately paying out huge sums in inheritance tax, which he said would have been 'very unfair'. According to him, they are entirely for the benefit of his jet-set daughters Tamara and Petra and ex-wife – and he neither has anything to do with the management of the funds involved, nor benefits from them. As a result, he says, he is not liable for any tax relating to the trusts. Scroll down for video . Bribery charge: Bernie Ecclestone in court in Munich, Germany, last week . But if it were to be proved that he did benefit from the trusts or help manage them, he could face a monumental tax bill – which he said in court could amount to more than £1billion. A long HMRC inquiry into the trusts, however, suddenly ended when £10million was handed over, BBC1's Panorama is to report tonight. According to the programme, court documents reveal that one of the lawyers who runs the family trusts, Swiss solicitor Frederique Flournoy, told German prosecutors in 2011 that the long-running investigation by HMRC into the Ecclestone family trusts was settled in 2008. She reportedly said: 'The Inland Revenue offered to conclude the matter if we paid £10million. Without knowing the legal basis that had given rise to this offer, we decided to pay up, without discussing things in great detail.' Miss Flournoy is also said to have revealed that since Mr Ecclestone and his wife divorced in 2009, she had been paying him around £60million a year – a surprise to those who assumed it was he who had given her a massive payoff when they parted. She said the payments were from his ex-wife directly, rather than from the family trusts – although she added that Slavica Ecclestone had herself taken about £700million from the trusts. There was no answer at Mr Ecclestone's palatial home overlooking Hyde Park in Central London yesterday. When approached by Panorama, Mr Ecclestone refused to answer detailed questions about the trusts. He did, however, deny any wrongdoing, saying he personally stumped up almost £52million in tax last year, and had always paid his fair share. Mr Ecclestone said: 'Other Britons with my wealth and means have chosen to live abroad to avoid paying British taxes. However, I am proud to be British, proud to live in Britain, and proud to make my contribution by paying my taxes here.' Mr Ecclestone said his divorce was a 'private matter', but there was nothing contrived or artificial about the transfer of assets to his wife in 1996. A lawyer for the family trusts, meanwhile, said: 'Mr Ecclestone has not exerted, and has never sought to exert, any control over the management of the trusts.' The lawyer also said that the transcripts from the German prosecutor contained errors – but did not say what they were. Slavica Ecclestone's lawyer said the family trusts were managed by appointed trustees who did not include Mr Ecclestone. * Bernie Ecclestone: Lies, Bribes and Formula One will be shown on BBC One tonight at 8.30. COMMENTARY by TOM BOWER . Money has always been Bernie Ecclestone's prime motivation. Born in comparative poverty in East London, he became one of Britain's richest tycoons by transforming Formula One from a sport for car enthusiasts into a global brand producing profits of more than £1billion a year. During that journey, he has learnt to duck and dive as he pocketed at least £2.5billion for himself.For a man who left school at 15 to trade motorbike parts while employed by the Gas Board, and who honed his skills by haggling over the prices of used cars with criminals, the fruits of his wealth have been sweet. They include a large yacht, racehorses, fabulous houses across London and in Switzerland, a private jet and even his own airport in Biggin Hill. With typical swagger, Ecclestone always pays in cash, often peeling off 500-euro notes from a wad. Indeed, he has been known to carry $1million (£600,000) in cash in a plastic bag – and then leave the bag in a room by mistake. With his vast fortune, $1million is petty cash. Life of luxury: Bernie Ecclestone's yacht, Sea Force One . Of course, it should be no surprise that someone who has amassed such wealth should come under intense public scrutiny – he is currently accused in a German court of paying a £27million bribe to a banker to secure the sale of a stake in Formula One to a company he favoured. Now he faces Panorama's allegations of a secret agreement to avoid £1billion in taxes. For his part, Ecclestone, an inveterate gambler, is unfazed. Last night he told me: 'Everything about my taxes is clear and straight, yet everyone is looking for a mystery. It's not there.' In the tycoon's view, Panorama is sensationalising an ordinary and legal arrangement. Others, of course, may see  matters differently. The story behind the BBC team's allegation started in 1996, when Ecclestone, then 66, was trying to raise £1billion by selling part of his Formula One empire. During the negotiations, lawyers told him that his then wife, Slavica Malic, a statuesque Croatian model he met during the Italian Grand Prix in Monza, couldn't inherit his fortune without paying inheritance taxes because she was not domiciled  in Britain. So, to avoid his family losing nearly half his fortune on his death, Ecclestone legally transferred his wealth to a trust in Switzerland which would be completely controlled by his wife for the benefit of herself and their two daughters. To guarantee that no inheritance taxes could be claimed by the Inland Revenue, Ecclestone would have no control over the trust. Also, for the tax avoidance to be watertight, he had to live for another seven years. The scheme nearly collapsed in 1999 when he required heart surgery. He survived but there was another hitch in 2008: Slavica decided to file for a divorce. Suddenly, Ecclestone faced a major dilemma. His lawyers advised that he could claim 50 per cent of the Swiss trusts from Slavica but that would ruin the perfect tax protection plan he had created. So instead, he asked Slavica to pay him what she thought 'fair'. Slavica duly agreed to give her ex-husband £60 million a year for ten years. That crisis may have been overcome but it also coincided with an inquiry by the Inland Revenue into Ecclestone's private use of his company's cars, plane and homes. In the Revenue's opinion, Ecclestone should have paid more tax on the benefits. In due course, both sides agreed to settle for a payment of £10million. At the same time, Slavica agreed to settle her own outstanding taxes for having benefited from the trust, and she also paid the taxman £10million. But it is the management of the family trust which has resulted in Ecclestone standing trial in Germany, charged with bribery. In 2002, the then majority-owner of Formula One, a German TV tycoon, became bankrupt. His shares were seized by a German bank which had loaned him the money for the original purchase. In a complicated case, the German authorities allege that Ecclestone bribed the German banker controlling the shares to ensure that Formula One was sold to a private equity group of Ecclestone's choice. The prosecution alleges that by securing the sale of the stake to the company, Ecclestone would remain in charge of Formula One and its commercial rights, broadcast payments and sponsorship deals. Ecclestone, who once advised me: 'Never threaten – just do it!', admits making the payment but says he was the victim of blackmail connected to the issue of whether he controlled his family trust in Switzerland. Having transformed himself from a second-hand car dealer into the owner of one of the world's most popular sports, he admits he breaks rules – but not laws. Controversially, he has said: 'First get on, then get rich, then get honest,' and, 'In Formula One, everyone cheats. The trick is not to get caught.' Competitive to his core, with steel-tipped elbows, Ecclestone – like so many other tycoons – always wants to win. 'Show me a good loser,' he has said, 'and I'll show you a loser.' * Tom Bower is the author of No Angel: The Secret Life of Bernie Ecclestone .","Deal could be overturned and F1 boss could again face a large bill .

Members of the RMT union plan to walk out for 48 hours from 9pm today and for three days from the same time next Monday in a row over ticket office closures. Passengers have been warned to expect disruption on the Tube and other types of public transport in the capital. Scroll down for video . Action: Tube bosses will today hold last-ditch talks aimed at averting strikes by London Underground workers . Meetings were held last week but failed to break the deadlock, with the union sticking to its opposition to the closures and the loss of jobs. London Underground says that only 3 per cent of tickets are sold at ticket offices, and that staff would be better employed on station concourses. Managing director Mike Brown said: 'The RMT leadership are making this up on the hoof. Suddenly, they want . to unilaterally tear up the long-established and collectively agreed . option of voluntary redundancy, throwing into question the plans of over . 650 staff who have chosen to leave us. 'The RMT leadership has also failed to take on board the significant changes we have made to our original proposals. Standing firm: LU managing director Mike Brown said members of the RMT union should 'call off the strike and save commuters and businesses from disruption'. He added: 'We will not be diverted from doing the right thing' 'They should clearly now call off the strike and save London’s commuters and businesses from disruption. 'We . will not be diverted from doing the right thing. No responsible . management can stand by and force customers to pay £50 million a year . for services which can be delivered far better and while keeping fares . down.' But Mick Cash, acting general secretary of the RMT, said: 'RMT is committed to the talks process and we will be available tomorrow as I have made clear to Tube boss Mike Brown. 'It is essential that the promise we were given for a full line-by-line and station-by-station review of the cuts and closures, and their impact on staff, passengers and safety, is carried out and that the cuts are halted to allow that process to take place without a gun at our members’ heads. 'This dispute is solely about cash-led cuts to jobs and services that would decimate Tube safety.' LU claimed the RMT was demanding the withdrawal of long-standing voluntary redundancy arrangements. It added that said the modernisation of the Tube will mean more staff visible and available to customers than ever before in the public areas of stations - offering on a permanent basis the levels of customer service provided during the London 2012 Games.","Tube bosses will today hold last-ditch talks aimed at averting strikes .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Envy: 38 per cent of neighbours eye up next door's garden, looks, jobs and social life . Whether it’s their cars, their homes or even their bins, it seems we just can’t help eyeing up our neighbours’ lifestyles. And now, according to a study, the desire to keep up with the Joneses has reached epidemic proportions – with 38 per cent of Britons admitting they can’t stop peering over the garden fence. The poll by energy firm E.ON found our top priority is sizing up next door’s back garden but we also rate our neighbours on their looks, jobs, social life and car. An eco-friendly 16 per cent even find themselves getting competitive about how much the neighbours recycle. One in eight of those who like to keep an eye on their neighbours' lifestyles confessed to comparing their DIY skills – and the same number judged which of their neighbours had managed to raise the best-behaved children. The research suggests that even in the age of social networking, we still tend to compare ourselves with the people who live close by. Around 31 per cent said they have changed their behaviour in a bid to fit in with their neighbours. Despite this, 57 per cent said they would feel mortified if anyone found out, with just 15 per cent opening up about their copycat behaviour. Anthony Ainsworth, from E.ON, said: 'Our research shows it’s common to compare ourselves to our neighbours to see how we stack up. 'Indeed, millions of us have actually changed the way we behave as a result of these comparisons.' Cars, DIY skills and recycling habits are among the other factors we envy in families down the street . And psychologist Jo Hemmings said: 'An important part of feeling secure, relaxed and comfortable is believing we fit in well with our surroundings – which particularly applies in our local neighbourhood.' She added: 'We don’t always want others to know we’re comparing, so having a sneaky peek at our neighbour’s garden or their physical appearance can help us modify our own lifestyles. 'This enables us to feel a greater sense of belonging.'","38 per cent of Britons compare their back garden with their neighbours'

"By . Emily Crane . A Melbourne father is dead and his five-year-old daughter is in a critical condition after their light plane crashed into a home shortly after take-off yesterday afternoon. Peter Doutch, 44, and his daughter Emily, 5, took off on the recreational flight from Tyabb Airport in the city's southeast about 5.20pm yesterday. The plane stalled minutes into the flight and crashed into a Seaview Road home just 2km away from the airport. Tragic: Peter Doutch died in the plane crash in Melbourne while his daughter Emily, five, survived but is critically ill in hospital . Neighbour Kevin Paganoni witnessed the crash and told the Herald Sun he found the little girl in the wreckage as fuel leaked from the aircraft. 'She was calling out and crying a fair bit… she was badly cut up and I lifted her out and put her on the bloke’s lawn and we wrapped her in a blanket. It was pretty scary all right,' Mr Paganoni said. The plane clipped the roof of the home before smashing into the side of the house, another witness, Rob Boer, told The Sydney Morning Herald. 'It was spitting and coughing like it was running out of fuel,' Mr Boer said. 'It wasn’t lined up with the runway. It was a couple of hundred metres off the line they usually come in on, so we knew something was wrong straight away.' The shocked owners of the home weren’t inside when the crash occurred but said they heard an 'almighty crash' – they had been outside saying goodbye to their children just minutes before. The couple rushed to help comfort and treat the young girl until paramedics and police arrived. Emily suffered head injuries and remains in a critical condition after being airlifted to the Royal Children’s Hospital where her mother Sue spent the night by her bedside. Devoted father: Mr Doutch had taken his daughter for a recreational flight when the accident happened. He is believed to have died on impact . The girl’s helmet had been knocked off by the impact of the crash, according to Mr Boer. Police said Mr Doutch was declared dead at the scene and most likely died on impact. Mr Doutch, who worked as a Victorian State Emergency Service volunteer for 20 years, has been described as 'a true, dedicated volunteer'. 'Everyone’s just in shock. He was a very happy go-lucky guy,' Frankston SES controller Brian McMannis said. Teachers at John Paul College are currently supporting Emily’s older brother Daniel. 'We are absolutely devastated by the tragedy of the event,' Principal Jane Tibb said. 'And certainly (we will) offer support to the family on an ongoing basis as they deal with this absolute disaster.' Investigators are travelling from Brisbane to inspect the crash site before debris is removed from the house. A report is being prepared for the coroner.

"By . Alex Greig . A Maine couple may face charges after recording a very close encounter with a bull moose while snowmobiling last week. Janis and Bob Powell posted the two-and-a-half minute video to YouTube last Friday which shows the couple, on two separate snowmobiles, chasing a bull moose along a trail in Jackman before the animal stops and confronts them. The footage incurred the wrath of wildlife lovers and the couple is now being investigated by the Maine Warden Service. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

Filmed by Janis Powell, the encounter . shows the moose charging at a fleeing Bob Powell, with Janis Powell . eventually firing a handgun to scare the animal off. The video was posted to YouTube five days ago and has since garnered 146,000 views - and a lot of opinions. Janis Powell reposted the video on Saturday, but tellingly removed the first 18 seconds, which shows the couple chasing the moose on their loud and fast snowmobiles. This action aroused even more heated criticism. The comments have now been disabled on the video, after the couple received what Janis Powell describes as harassing messages. 'People have started to comment that weâ€™re trying to hide things on purpose,' she told the Bangor Daily News on Sunday. Charge: Bob Powell's attempts to shoo away the moose were unsuccessful . Contact: The moose cuffed Powell as his wife Janis recorded the incident with growing fear . Undeterred: Bob Powell climbs onto his wife's snowmobile to try and get away from the moose, which shows no sign of departing . 'Thatâ€™s not true; we have nothing to hide. I edited this video earlier because it was clear that a lot of people have no idea at all what they are watching, were completely misinterpreting it, and were very rude to us as a result.' She reposted the original video Saturday evening and says she and her husband reported the incident to the Maine Warden Service immediately after it happened. Corporal John MacDonald said the wardens have seen the video and that the investigation may take up to two weeks. 'We are seeing what everyone else can see on that video,' MacDonald told the Bangor Daily News. 'We need to take a closer look at it and see if [the Powells] did anything illegal or unreasonable.'If charged and convicted, MacDonald said, the Powells could be facing a fine, the amount of which would be determined by the district attorney and the courts.

Mark Latti, spokesman for Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, said anyone encountering a moose should keep their distance and allow the animal to go about its business in peace. 'Seeing a moose on a snowmobile trail is not all that unusual,' Latti told the Bangor Daily News. 'People need to stop and let the moose go on its way. It may take a few minutes but that is a better alternative than stressing the moose out by getting too close. 'Itâ€™s been a long, hard winter for a lot of wildlife, including the moose. People need to slow down and let them disperse naturally.' Janis Powell says she and her husband had no intention of stressing the moose. 'We have nothing but the utmost respect for wildlife, and would never do anything to harm these wonderful creatures,' she said, adding that the Powells will 'certainly be giving moose some more space in the future.'","A Maine couple may face charges after a video they posted on YouTube of a moose encounter caused outrage .

"By . Adam Duggan . It’s normally competitors, not spectators, who put themselves in danger at extreme sport events. However, this wasn’t the case at the UCI World Cup in Cairns on Saturday, where one man was lucky to escape without life-threatening injuries after taking a brutal fall riding an injured cyclist’s bike downhill. Pro rider Adam Brayton was involved in a severe crash during the event which left him with a broken leg and in need of hospital treatment. Disaster: Adam Brayton's friend decided to ride the competitor's bike down the track instead of wheeling it away at the UCI World Championship event in Cairns . A member of the crowd - who has not been identified - offered to look after his bike while he was being treated. But he was unable to resist trying out the track himself - and then suffered a brutal fall as he was traversing a difficult part of the track known as the ‘whoops’. 'I only met him after my crash as he offered to take my bike down the hill for me,' Mr Brayton said. 'I think he's ok though he was in my ambulance on a spine board and was pretty k'od but that's all I know I'm going to pop down to hospital tomorrow and see how he's doing,' Mr Brayton told online biking magazine PinkBike. Professional downhill mountain biker Steve Peat posted to Instagram on Sunday that he spoke with the injured spectator, who is recovering in hospital with two broken vertebrae and a dislocated shoulder. Heavy rain took its toll on the tropical far north Queensland track, with some parts of the mountain bike course being turned into mud. Queensland Health have confirmed that a 28-year-old man transported to Cairns Hospital on Saturday afternoon is in a stable condition. Slow-and-steady: A spectator, riding Adam Brayton's bike, rounds a corner nearing the 'whomps' at the UCI Championships in Cairns .

"By . John Hall . Attack: Iain Duncan Smith was criticised for suggesting welfare cuts encouraged businesses . The burden of high taxes and red tape is preventing Britain from creating enough globally successful entrepreneurs, according to a think-tank. Analysis by the Centre for Policy Studies found the UK does not even rank among the top 10 countries for producing billionaire entrepreneurs. Britain lags behind the likes of Hong Kong, the U.S., Australia, Canada and Ireland according to the study - although still performed better than the majority of eurozone countries, including Germany. In an article for The Daily Telegraph, the report's author Dr Nima Sanandaji urged the Government to cut capital gains tax and scrap the top 45p tax rate. He also criticised Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith for suggesting the Coalition's welfare reforms were encouraging more people to start successful businesses. Last week Mr Duncan Smith hailed Britain's 'entrepreneurial spirit' after the Bank of England highlighted figures showing a record 4.5 million people are self-employed. But Dr Sanandaji wrote: 'The Work and Pensions Secretary was conflating self-employment with entrepreneurship. In reality, the two phenomena are quite different.' 'The Coalition's benefit reforms may well promote self-employment, which is a good thing in itself. But it is wrong to suppose that reducing benefits will do much for entrepreneurship. 'In order to do that, the Coalition should turn its attention to cutting business and personal tax rates and taking the axe to red tape.' Contrast: Hong Kong (pictured) produces almost three entrepreneurs for every million, Israel 1.7 per million and the US 1.3 per million . Success stories:  There were a total of 22 British billionaire entrepreneurs between 1996 and 2010, including retail tycoon Sir Philip Green (left) and Virgin founder Sir Richard Branson (right) Dr Sanandaji analysed nearly 1,000 self-made men and women who, according to business magazine Forbes, have earned at least one billion dollars. There were a total of 22 British billionaire entrepreneurs between 1996 and 2010, including retail tycoon Sir Philip Green and Virgin founder Sir Richard Branson. According to the analysis, Britain produced one entrepreneur billionaire for every two million people.

The Newhaven to Dieppe ferry has cost French taxpayers £190million over the past ten years. But a senior official in France has warned that the route cannot continue to depend on the massive public subsidy. The Transmanche ferry route is currently run by DFDS Seaways but its contract expires next year. The Transmanche ferry route is currently run by DFDS Seaways but its contract expires next year . It’s now unclear if a new operator can be found beyond 2015, which would mark the 50th anniversary of the route from Newhaven, East Sussex. In the meantime, the General Council of Seine-Maritime (CGSM), which subsidises the link, is looking for new investors. Nicolas Rouly, president of the CGSM, said: 'I wonder about the relevance of a link that depends solely on public funds. 'This is a potentially difficult decision to take to stop the line. But we have spent £190million pounds of public money in ten years.' Users of the line have reacted with dismay at the threat, describing the threat of closure as a 'disaster'. Roger Hudson, of Eastbourne, East Sussex, said: 'Our government is pouring billions into already saturated rail transport alongside private initiatives yet ignores routes like this that relieves the burden on rail and the inadequate road network. 'It would be a disaster for Sussex passengers and businesses if this line were to close.

"By . Sophie Borland . Dr Fiona Cornish has warned that the system is under too much strain . Rising numbers of family doctors are quitting because they can’t face ‘five days a week of full-on clinical work’, a top GP has claimed. Dr Fiona Cornish said family doctors were ‘burning out’ because they are seeing patients and working in their surgery for up to 12 hours a day, as well as dealing with mounds of paperwork at the end of the day. GPs are struggling with the stresses of looking after elderly patients with complicated illnesses, she added, comparing the pressure they are under to those of high-flying City workers. She also predicted many surgeries will go bust over the next year while others may have to lay off staff leading to ‘dangerously’ long waits for appointments. Although GPs benefited from a contract in 2004 that led to salaries soaring to £105,000 a year despite not having to work evenings and weekends, their morale has plummeted in recent years. They say the workload is now harder as patients are elderly and more demanding whilst at the same time the Government has cut their funding so they have to do more with less. Dr Cornish, president of the Medical Women’s Society, an influential body of female doctors, said: ‘We have a toxic trio – an ageing population, shrinking resources and patients becoming more demanding. Dr Cornish says GPs can spend 12 hours a day on patient consultations before even starting their paperwork . ‘GPs are burning out and each GP then has to do more. GPs have had enough, we can’t do it any more. ‘In a busy day you’d have about 60 consultations either face to face or over the phone. There’s a limit to how much you can do in a day. ‘Diminishing numbers of men or women can take five days a week of full-on clinical work seeing patients for 12 hours a day. David Cameron has pledged to increase funding to GP surgeries by £50m to help pay for longer opening hours . ‘More and more doctors are burning out and leaving the profession early, in the same way that City workers retire in their fifties, often for health reasons.’ Last month a survey of 3,000 family doctors by their union, the British Medical Association, found that six in ten planned to retire early because it was too stressful. Dr Cornish, 53, who is married with four children, also warned that many smaller, family-run practices would go bust over the next few years due to a lack of Government funding. She predicted that in future, patients will be under the care of large centres run by private firms working for the NHS. ‘It’s the end of the family doctor as we know it. We will just end up with Virgin Care doctors in supermarket set ups. Large centres just running on a business.’ She also warned funding cuts would lead to a squeeze on staff: ‘Practices will have to lay off nurses, lay off staff and then it becomes unsafe. ‘When you have a two week waiting time for a routine appointment that is dangerous. We just can’t keep up.’ Last month a survey of 11,000 patients commissioned by the Mail found that many were waiting between three and four weeks to see their GP. The Prime Minister this month promised to give GP surgeries an extra £50 million to open more at evenings and weekends, but their union warned this money would not be enough to make a significant difference. New rules: Mr Hunt meets a patient at London's King's College Hospital . Jeremy Hunt last night vowed to stop the NHS wasting millions of pounds on vital supplies. The Health Secretary announced new rules to end the scandal of hospitals paying massively different prices for hundreds of everyday products because they purchase them separately. A central procurement list will allow the NHS to use its buying power to drive down the costs, with all trusts paying the same for goods. It will save taxpayers up to £500million over the next two years, said Mr Hunt. At present, hospitals negotiate prices individually and so cannot get the best deals. The NHS spends £25million on sterile surgeons’ gloves, with one brand the dominant market leader. But if trusts moved to an alternative brand, they could save up to 38 per cent on the current prices, said the Department of Health. A Government-appointed ‘procurement tsar’ will produce the NHS core list to drive out variation and secure lower prices from suppliers. ‘Difficult decisions’ in other areas meant the Government could protect the health budget, which will rise £12.7billion in this parliament, said a source. But the NHS had to ‘raise its game to meet the challenge of an ageing society’.","Dr Fiona Cornish says family doctors are 'burning out' after spending 12 hours a day seeing patients and then facing stacks of paperwork .

"By . Wills Robinson . However the team from Merseyside were bowled out for just three runs in response, one of the lowest totals in the sport's history. News of the shockingly low score by spread fast on Twitter and attracted comment as far away as Australia where fans are still celebrating their resounding Ashes victory. Pavillion: The home of Wirral CC, who were bowled out for just three runs in a league game against Haslington . Piers Morgan also joined in, posting a photo of their bleak scorecard on the social media site. Wirral . thought they had a good chance of beating Haslington in the TACS . Partnership Cheshire League Division Three match after bowling out their . opponents for 108 in yesterday's clash. Wirral had won their opening match of the campaign the previous week and one of the players, Matt Garrett, 24, said: 'It was a bit of a pudding of a wicket but we had chased down a score of more than 200 to win last week and were confident we could get close to their score. 'However there was some good line and length bowling from them, and some poor shot selection from us, and we began to crumble as the pressure built up. 'It was just one of those days - you . don't expect the first 10 batsmen all to get ducks. It was one of those . strange things - that's why we love the game of cricket.' The only run was scored by the number 11 batsman, Connor Hodson, and the highest scorer was extras - there were two leg byes. Accepting defeat: The club posted a light-heated message about their loss on Twitter after the game . Scorecard: The batting performances are much to be desired with number 10, Chris Hobson, top scoring with just one run . Mr Garrett, who is studying sports development and physical education at Liverpool John Moores University, said: 'I hear it's even in the news in Australia. It was just dying down after they beat us 5-0 in the Ashes and we've prodded the beast again.' The team has its third league match of the season next week. 'I think we'll do better,' Mr Garrett said. 'Well, we can't do much worse.' The club have asked former England internationals Michael Vaughan, Andrew Flintoff, Phil Tufnell and David Lloyd for some coaching via social media. Embarrassed captain Peter Clewes later admitted: 'It was not my best day as captain. We chased down 203 last week. It was all going so well!""

"By . James Tozer . Lee Rigby's family have fought hard to stop Far Right groups co-opting his name for their causes . The mother of murdered soldier Lee Rigby yesterday told of her anger that an extremist party had been officially permitted to use his name on ballot papers for next month's European elections - the first anniversary of his death. As the approval given to Britain First - which describes itself as a 'patriotic resistance frontline' - was branded 'alarming' by Commons Speaker John Bercow and 'sickening' by a coalition minister, Lyn Rigby said she was 'heartbroken' that they had been allowed to attempt to hijack the tragedy for their own ends. The Electoral Commission has now made a grovelling apology for allowing Britain First to use the slogan 'Remember Lee Rigby' on voting slips for next month's poll, accepting it should never have been permitted. Fusilier Rigby's family have consistently distanced themselves from Far Right groups seeking to make capital out of his murder by two Islamic extremists, and his mother immediately hit out at the decision, writing on Facebook: 'Their views are not what Lee believed in and has (sic) no support from the family.' Highlighting that the poll takes place on May 22 - the first anniversary of his killing - she added: 'Well yet again can any more heartbreak be thrown at me and my family so heartbroken tonight.' The Electoral Commission have apologised for allowing Britain First to use the slogan on European election ballot papers but says it's too late to change . Fusilier Rigby, a 25-year-old father of one, was hacked to death by Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale near Woolwich Barracks in south-east London last year. As protests were held in the days after his horrific death, his family called for a peaceful response saying he 'would not want people to use his name as an excuse to carry out attacks against others'. On Saturday the Commission said it had 'only just realised this mistake', saying the slogan 'should never have been permitted'. It said it had apologised directly to the Rigby family but said it was too late for the ballot papers to be changed. Lyn Rigby, left, along with Lee's father Ian, at their son's funeral . It approved the slogan for Britain First to use across the UK, but it is currently only thought to be using it in Wales. Jenny Watson, chair of the Electoral Commission, said 'an immediate and full independent investigation' would follow to 'prevent this from ever happening again'. However a deepening political storm yesterday saw Cabinet Office minister Greg Clark said it was 'sickening' that anyone could try to make 'political capital' out of Fusilier Rigby's murder. He called for a 'full investigation' by the Speaker's Committee, which oversees the work of the commission. 'The whole country will be outraged that the memory of Lee Rigby should be abused in this way, and our heart goes out to his family, friends and colleagues,' he added. A spokesman for Mr Bercow branded the approval for the slogan an 'alarming development' and said he too wanted an independent inquiry conducted as a 'matter of urgency'. Earlier this year Adebolajo, 29, was given a whole-life term while Adebowale, 22, was jailed for a minimum of 45 years for his murder.","Lyn Rigby is 'heartbroken' party has been allowed to use her son's name .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . The mother of a 15-year-old schoolgirl murdered by her ex-boyfriend has claimed she was plagued by disturbing nightmares of her killer in the weeks before her death. Rebecca Aylward was killed for a bet in 2010 by Josh Davies, then 16, who lured her into woods near Bridgend, South Wales, and smashed her skull with a rock. He was later given a 14-year prison sentence for her murder. Now Sonia Oatley, Rebecca's grieving mother, has said she had disturbing visions about Davies before he killed her daughter, even though she was completely taken in by his charms. Murder: Rebecca Aylward 15 (left) was brutally murdered by her ex-boyfriend Josh Davies (right) who was 16 at the time. He lured her into the woods near her home and smashed her skull with a large rock . The 53-year-old mother, who has two other children, even recalls Davies making racist comments in her home, and longing to join the Ku Klux Klan. She also said again that she wants the death penalty to be reinstated so that Davies can be killed for his crime. Ms Oatley said: 'I hope someone kills him. I want him to suffer. I don't think he is brave enough for suicide. He is a coward attacking little girls and children.' At Davies' trial, the judge described the boy's ‘deep-seated hatred’ towards Rebecca after their relationship ended. The jury heard how he regularly told friends of his plans to kill Rebecca, who was 5ft 2in and weighed just six stone, but that they never took his boasts seriously. Devastated: Sonia Oatley, Rebecca's mother, said she is now plagued by nightmares - and even suffered them before the killing . The schoolboy told friends of his plots to poison her with deadly foxglove, drown her in a river or throw her off a cliff. In one text to a friend Davies asked: ‘What would you do if I actually did kill her?' The friend replied: ‘Oh, I would buy you breakfast.’ Two days before the murder Davies sent a text saying: ‘Don’t say anything but you may just owe me a breakfast.’ On the day she was killed, Rebecca had bought a new outfit to meet Davies, thinking that they were going to get back together. She was ‘dancing and singing’ beforehand because she was excited, her sister Jessica said. Sentenced: Joshua Davies, pictured here with Rebecca Aylward at her home, will serve at least 14 years for her murder . 'Never forgotten': Ms Oatley is pictured right with Rebecca, whom she still thinks about every day . Davies, then just 15, lured Rebecca to a wooded area near his home in Aberkenfig, near Bridgend, South Wales, in October last year. He even spoke in sickening detail of the murder, telling a friend ‘the worst part of it was feeling and hearing her skull giving way’. Ms Oatley is now plagued by nightmares. She said: 'I have constant nightmares and I relive everything. Before it happened I was having nightmares about Davies. It was always in a forest and he was always a wolf. 'I would see him running through the forest. Then it would stand up and it would turn into Davies. I still have these dreams that he is chasing Becca.' Ms Oatley spoke of her ordeal ahead of the launch of a book she has written, called Bye Mam, I Love You - which were her daughter's last words to her. Grieving: Ms Oatley stands with her children Jessica, left, and Jack, right over a memorial bench in 2012 . She said: 'He could come out when he is around 30. This September he will have another 10 years. He can have a family and do it all over again then. 'He is extremely dangerous and unstable. He is capable of anything. I am very concerned about what he is learning in prison and who he is meeting.' 'He would come in the house and be full of life and be really polite, I never heard him use bad language,' she recalled. 'He started talking about how much he hated black people. We were living in Maesteg and he said he had heard there was a man there who was a member of the Ku Klux Klan. He wanted to join him. He told us, ""I want to meet him, I want to go out and get blacks.""' 'Rebecca's death is on my mind every minute of the day. I cannot get away from it. I have got photos everywhere all over the house. I will never let it be forgotten.'","Rebecca Aylward, 15, was murdered in 2010 by ex-boyfriend Josh Davies .

"By . Steven Adams . Recovery: Julie Penoyer's faith forbids transfusions . British scientists have created  a groundbreaking machine that recycles blood lost in operations. The invention will allow Jehovah’s Witnesses to have major surgery because it rules out the need for blood transfusions, which their faith forbids. The technology could also save the NHS millions by reducing the demand for donated blood. The Hemosep filtering machine was used recently on Jehovah’s Witness Julie Penoyer, 50. Doctors told the freelance translator she needed to have part of her aorta – the largest blood vessel in the body – replaced because it could burst at any time, killing her. She suffers from a rare inherited condition called Marfan Syndrome, which makes her cartilage highly stretchy, meaning the walls of  the top of her aorta were dangerously thin. But she said she would agree to surgery only if she could have the operation without a transfusion. Jehovah’s Witnesses believe it is against God’s will to ‘ingest blood’ in any way. The team at the Trent Cardiac Centre in Nottingham then mentioned the Hemosep machine. Unlike other blood recovery devices, it enables the collection not only of red blood cells but also of crucial cells and enzymes that help it to clot, meaning Mrs Penoyer could have the operation without receiving any blood products. She underwent the seven-hour operation in late January and is now recovering well after spending just 13 days in hospital. Last night she said: ‘People tell me they can’t believe I’ve recently had heart surgery. At last I can breathe properly again.’ During the operation Mrs Penoyer lost more than two pints of blood.  But this was pumped straight back into her body. The machine works by filtering blood through a plastic membrane that captures vital red blood cells, clotting cells called platelets and enzymes called clotting factors. Jonathan Bain, who operated the machine, explained: ‘We had to have everything connected in one continuous loop, so at no point would the blood have left her body’s circulation. We went to great lengths to make sure the loop was not broken.’ Discovery: The machine rules out the need for blood transfusions and could save the NHS millions by reducing the demand for donated blood . He added: ‘This was a life-saving operation because the danger was that her aorta could have ruptured  at any time. That would have been catastrophic.’ But it would have been nearly impossible to save her life after a rupture without resorting to a blood transfusion, he added. The machine was the brainchild  of Terry Gourlay, professor of biomedical engineering at Strathclyde University in Glasgow. He took his idea to Brightwake, a Midlands-based firm, which makes wound dressings and other high-tech medical products. Founder Steve Cotton said: ‘It  shows what is possible with a bit of British ingenuity.’ He has calculated the device could save the NHS more than £10 million a year by reducing the demand for donated blood.","Scientist created machine that recycles blood lost in operations .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . The nightingale is in dangerous decline and could disappear from Britain if breeding sites are not protected from developers, experts have warned. A 2012 survey by the British Trust for Ornithology showed there are just 3300 pairs of nightingales left in the whole country. Data from the organisation also suggests the number of the birds in Britain dropped by 57 per . cent between 1995 and 2009. Scroll down for video . There are only 3300 pairs of nightingales left in the whole of Britain - with numbers of the birds dropping by 57 per cent in 14 years data suggests . Due to this drastic decline in breeding population, the nightingale is now on the amber list of species of 'conservation concern' - a list compiled by a selection of the country's leading bird protection organisations. Now, nature-lovers are calling for a recording of the creature to be broadcast live on BBC radio. The idea marks a tradition set almost 90 years ago by the BBC - which on May 18th 1924 broadcast the sound of a nightingale singing in a Surrey wood to almost a million listeners. The broadcast became a tradition for 20 years until it was halted by the war. Conservationist Chris Rose, who has launched the petition calling for the broadcast to be reinstated, said: 'The nightingale is just one of many songbirds, which are rapidly vanishing from our countryside, our urban green sanctuaries and suburban woods, and therefore from our lives . 'Unfortunately developers and politicians don't care enough to ward off the most obvious threats at bay - at Lodge Hill in Kent, Britain's only woodland specifically designated as a valued breeding site for nightingales is under threat from developers. There are only 3300 pairs of nightingales left in the whole of Britain - with numbers of the birds dropping by 57 per cent in 14 years data suggests . 'We would like the BBC to restore the tradition and re-connect people all over Britain with the song of the nightingale, live, on May 18th.' 'We believe it's time for the BBC to re-start the tradition, to enrich our quality of life and give its millions of listeners the chance to hear a real, live nightingale singing, if only once a year. 'Fewer and fewer people now get to hear . the song these days and the reasons are complex - researchers blame a . combination of climate change, farm development in its African wintering . grounds, the destruction of nesting habitat by muntjac deer in this . country, poor woodland management and pesticides, for its decline. 'Anyone who has ever heard the song of a nightingale, knows the extraordinary heart-lifting, soul-penetrating power of the voice of this bird.' Paul Stancliffe, of the British Trust for Ornithology said: 'The song of the nightingale is arguably the most beautiful of any British bird but it is a song that is getting harder to hear with each passing year. 'Its stronghold has always been the south-east but even here it is declining and since 1995 we have lost almost half of our breeding nightingales. 'Add to this the very short song period, nightingales can only be reliably heard during the last days of April to the first few days of June, and we can all appreciate that hearing one is very special indeed.' Slightly larger than a robin, nightingales were first noted in Anglo Saxon times though fossilised remains date them back to as long as 100,000 years ago. The creature inspired John Keats to write one of his most famous poems - Ode to a Nightingale.

"By . Jennifer Newton . Naeem Williams, who could face the death penalty after being convicted of murdering his five-year-old daughter Talia . A former soldier in Hawaii could be the first to get the death penalty since it became a state after being found guilty of murdering his five-year-old daughter. A court in Honolulu convicted Naeem Williams of the murder of Talia Williams, who was beaten to death in July 2005. Hawaii abolished capital punishment in 1957 before it became a state in 1959. But Williams could still face a death sentence because the crime occurred on military property at Wheeler Army Air Force Base, and he is being tried in the federal system. Jurors will now be asked to decide whether Williams should be sentenced to death for killing the five-year-old during the sentencing phase of the trial. There have been 49 executions in Hawaii, the first in 1856 and the last recorded in 1944, according to the Death Penalty Information Centre. The last time the federal death penalty was approved for a Hawaii case was for a drug-related murder. However, the defendant took a plea deal that gave him a life sentence, then died of an apparent suicide about three months later. The trial of Williams lasted nearly two months in Honolulu and was filled with graphic testimony about abuses suffered by the child at the hands of her father and stepmother. The jury in the case found him guilty of all five counts including murder, aiding murder, conspiracy, obstruction of justice and making false statements. Williams' lawyers left the courthouse without commenting. They had argued in his . defence that while he beat Talia, it was unclear whether he caused her . death. Florence Nakakuni, a U.S. attorney in Hawaii, said prosecutors won't be able to comment until after sentencing. Talia Williams, the five-year-old who was beaten to death by her father Naeem Williams in Hawaii . Williams and his wife, Delilah Williams, have acknowledged beating, confining and restraining the girl in the seven months before her death. Delilah Williams also is charged with murder. She testified for the prosecution as part of a plea deal that calls for a 20-year prison term, but she has not yet been sentenced. She told jurors she once stomped on Talia until she felt a bone crack. The little girl had been living with her father and stepmother Delilah Williams in Hawaii . Naeem Williams testified earlier this month that he beat his daughter often because of her bathroom accidents and because he was taking out his marital frustrations on the child. He told the jury of seven men and five women that the day Talia died, he had punched her repeatedly after a night of drinking. He struck her so hard in the back that she hit her head on the floor and appeared to have a seizure, he said. The victim's mother Tarshia Williams, who is not married to the defendant but shares the same surname,  sat through the entire trial in the courtroom. Deliliah Williams, left, wife of Naeem Williams, right, has also been charged with Talia's murder. However, she testified for the prosecution as part of a plea deal . She said she attended every day because her daughter was alone when she went through the abuse. She added: 'She can rest now that her killer is guilty of what he did to her . 'Now my daughter can rest in peace despite all the pain she went through.' When asked whether Williams should be put to death, she paused, gathered herself and said, 'Whatever they decide.' The trial's sentencing phase starts Tuesday.","Naeem Williams found guilty of murdering five-year-old daughter Talia .

"By . Wills Robinson . Netflix has signed a deal with three small cable-providers in the US to become a regular TV channel. The agreements with Atlantic Broadband, RCN Telecom Services and Grande Communications gives the internet streaming site's subscription service a channel on TiVo boxes that the companies provide their customers. It will debut on Atlantic and RCN on Monday and then will expand on to Grande's service by end of next month. Breakthrough: The online streming service has signed a deal with three small cable providers, giving it a TiVo channel . Collectively, the three services have around 820,000 subscribers scattered through nine states and Washington D.C. Although it is a small fraction of the market, the deals represent another milestone for Netflix as it tries to make its Internet video service more like premium channels such as HBO and Showtime. The online streaming service has already been included on digital and satellite boxes in the UK, Denmark and Sweden, but has not been able to make similar inroads in the US until now. The company's nearly 36 million U.S. subscribers typically have to buy a separate device, such as games console or a specific device, if they want to stream video on to their TVs. That method usually requires a separate remote and an additional step to change to a different TV input. Now, Netflix will be like any other . channel on the cable-TV dial, but will rely on a high-speed . Internet connection to deliver its video. 'We . think this signals a new generation of cable-TV service of offerings,' said David Isenberg, Atlantic's chief marketing and strategy officer. 'It's a watershed moment.' He . likened what Netflix is doing for Internet video to what HBO did for . cable-TV when that service began transmitting through satellites in the . early 1970s. Popular: The site, which has been responsible for dramas such as House of Cards, has around 36million subscribers in the US . Netflix has been striving to become more HBO-like since it expanded upon its DVD-by-mail service and began offering Internet streaming seven years ago. In the past two years, the Los Gatos, California, company has been featuring more original programming, such as the critically acclaimed House of Cards and Orange Is The New Black to persuade more U.S. subscribers to pay $8 per month for its service. To help pay for its rising programming costs, Netflix plans to raise its prices by $1 or $2 by July. The higher tariff will initially only impact new customers. HBO, which is owned by Time Warner, views Netflix as such a threat that it has steadfastly refused to licenses its old TV shows, such as The Sopranos and The Wire, to the internet video service. Those HBO shows instead will be streamed through a rival Internet video service offered through Amazon.com Inc.'s Prime shipping service as part of deal announced earlier this week. 'HBO fears Netflix's growing industry power,' BTIG Research analyst Richard Greenfield wrote in a Thursday blog post. Competition: With original programmes such as Orange Is The New Black, Netlix is trying to rival premium streaming services such as those used by HBO . 'We suspect HBO wanted to balance Netflix's growing media industry hegemony by helping to bolster their largest direct-to-consumer competitor — Amazon.' Unlike their partnerships with HBO and Showtime, the cable-TV providers aren't offering a Netflix subscription as part of their bundled packages. People will still have to open a Netflix account through the company's website or mobile application, although Atlantic is trying to make that process easier by offering a way to sign up on the TV screen. Netflix is still hoping to be added to the programming lineup of a major cable-TV service. It seems unlikely that Netflix will make its way onto a cable box offered by the biggest service, Comcast Corp any time soon. The relationship between the two companies has grown frosty because Netflix is opposing Comcast's proposed $45 billion purchase of another major cable-TV service, Time Warner Cable Inc.","Internet streamers have made agreement with Atlantic Broadband .

"By . Mark Duell . Almost 1,000 prisoners in British jails are from Poland, it was revealed today. They make up 9 per cent of the 11,000 foreign inmates behind bars in the UK - and the next worst offenders are Ireland and Jamaica, with more than 700 prisoners from both of those countries. Britain is said to spend more than £360million a year to keep foreign inmates in jail, with the other countries in the top ten being Romania, Pakistan, Lithuania, Nigeria, Somalia, India and Albania. Behind bars: The most notorious Polish inmates are Daniel Pelka’s mother Magdalena Luczak, 27, and stepfather Mariusz Krezolek, 34, of Coventry, who committed 'appalling cruelty' against the boy . The figures were revealed by the Sunday People, which reported that the UK’s jail population is 85,000 - and just 17 criminals have been sent home in the European Union since December 2011. The most notorious Polish inmates are Daniel Pelka’s mother and stepfather, who are each serving at least 30 years for the ‘unimaginable acts of cruelty and brutality’ they committed against him. The judge condemned ‘callous and wretched’ mother Magdalena Luczak, 27, and stepfather Mariusz Krezolek, 34, of Coventry, saying that little Daniel ‘must have been absolutely terrified’. The four-year-old boy died in March 2012 after a sustained period of ‘appalling cruelty’ during which the couple starved him, force-fed him salt, tortured him and locked him in a tiny room. Graph: Poles make up 9 per cent of the 11,000 foreign inmates behind bars in the UK - and the next worst offenders are Ireland and Jamaica, with more than 700 prisoners from each of those countries . Other Polish inmates include a chemistry lecturer who was jailed last month after plotting a Breaking Bad-style operation to produce £4million of amphetamine every two days. Ryszard Jakubczyk, 61, planned to make the stimulant drug in a secret laboratory in Grantham, Lincolnshire. He hoped to produce 88lbs of almost pure amphetamine every 48 hours. Glyn Travis, of the Professional Trades Union for Prison, Correctional and Secure Psychiatric Workers, told the Sunday People: ‘The prison system is bursting at the seams. ‘The Government needs to engage with other countries to take ownership of their offenders so the Ministry of Justice can target offenders and address offending behaviour.’ But Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said: ‘The foreign national prisoner population is lower than in 2010 and reducing it further is a top priority for this Government.’ Mr Wright added that more than 4,500 foreign criminals were deported from Britain last year. Under a deal agreed by the last Labour government, no Polish inmates will have to serve their sentences back home until at least December 2016 to give the country time to build new jails. The Mail reported in January how the deal is one of a string of similar arrangements between Britain and the rest of the EU for so-called compulsory prisoner transfer agreements. These allow criminals convicted of crimes in the UK, who have at least six months to serve, to be forcibly removed to serve their sentences overseas. A similar deal is in place with Albania.","Polish prisoners make up 9% of 11,000 foreign inmates in British jails .

"COMMENTARY by By . Tom Bower . Born in . comparative poverty in East London, he became one of Britain's richest . tycoons by transforming Formula One from a sport for car enthusiasts . into a global brand producing profits of more than £1billion a year. During that journey, he has learnt to duck and dive as he pocketed at least £2.5billion for himself.For . a man who left school at 15 to trade motorbike parts while employed by . the Gas Board, and who honed his skills by haggling over the prices of . used cars with criminals, the fruits of his wealth have been sweet. They . include a large yacht, racehorses, fabulous houses across London and in . Switzerland, a private jet and even his own airport in Biggin Hill. Bribe charge: Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone stands between his lawyers as he arrives in the regional court in in Munich, Germany . With . typical swagger, Ecclestone always pays in cash, often peeling off . 500-euro notes from a wad. Indeed, he has been known to carry $1million . (£600,000) in cash in a plastic bag – and then leave the bag in a room . by mistake. With his vast fortune, $1million is petty cash. Of . course, it should be no surprise that someone who has amassed such . wealth should come under intense public scrutiny – he is currently . accused in a German court of paying a £27million bribe to a banker to . secure the sale of a stake in Formula One to a company he favoured. Now . he faces Panorama's allegations of a secret agreement to avoid £1billion . in taxes. For . his part, Ecclestone, an inveterate gambler, is unfazed. Last night he . told me: 'Everything about my taxes is clear and straight, yet everyone . is looking for a mystery. It's not there.' In the tycoon's view, Panorama is sensationalising an ordinary and legal arrangement. Others, of course, may see  matters differently. The . story behind the BBC team's allegation started in 1996, when . Ecclestone, then 66, was trying to raise £1billion by selling part of . his Formula One empire. During . the negotiations, lawyers told him that his then wife, Slavica Malic, a . statuesque Croatian model he met during the Italian Grand Prix in . Monza, couldn't inherit his fortune without paying inheritance taxes . because she was not domiciled in Britain. Life of luxury: Bernie Ecclestone's yacht, Sea Force One . So, . to avoid his family losing nearly half his fortune on his death, . Ecclestone legally transferred his wealth to a trust in Switzerland . which would be completely controlled by his wife for the benefit of . herself and their two daughters. To guarantee that no inheritance taxes . could be claimed by the Inland Revenue, Ecclestone would have no control . over the trust. Also, for the tax avoidance to be watertight, he had to live for another seven years. The . scheme nearly collapsed in 1999 when he required heart surgery. He . survived but there was another hitch in 2008: Slavica decided to file . for a divorce. Suddenly, Ecclestone faced a major dilemma. His . lawyers advised that he could claim 50 per cent of the Swiss trusts . from Slavica but that would ruin the perfect tax protection plan he had . created. So instead, he asked Slavica to pay him what she thought . 'fair'. Slavica duly agreed to give her ex-husband £60 million a year . for ten years. That . crisis may have been overcome but it also coincided with an inquiry by . the Inland Revenue into Ecclestone's private use of his company's cars, . plane and homes. It is believed that Slavica Ecclestone, right, has paid £300 million to her ex-husband Bernie, right, since their 2009 divorce . In . the Revenue's opinion, Ecclestone should have paid more tax on the . benefits. In due course, both sides agreed to settle for a payment of . £10million. At . the same time, Slavica agreed to settle her own outstanding taxes for . having benefited from the trust, and she also paid the taxman . £10million. But it is the management of the family trust which has resulted in Ecclestone standing trial in Germany, charged with bribery. In . 2002, the then majority-owner of Formula One, a German TV tycoon, . became bankrupt. His shares were seized by a German bank which had . loaned him the money for the original purchase. In . a complicated case, the German authorities allege that Ecclestone . bribed the German banker controlling the shares to ensure that Formula . One was sold to a private equity group of Ecclestone's choice. The . prosecution alleges that by securing the sale of the stake to the . company, Ecclestone would remain in charge of Formula One and its . commercial rights, broadcast payments and sponsorship deals. Ecclestone, . who once advised me: 'Never threaten – just do it!', admits making the . payment but says he was the victim of blackmail connected to the issue . of whether he controlled his family trust in Switzerland. Having . transformed himself from a second-hand car dealer into the owner of one . of the world's most popular sports, he admits he breaks rules – but not . laws. Controversially, . he has said: 'First get on, then get rich, then get honest,' and, 'In . Formula One, everyone cheats. The trick is not to get caught.' Competitive to his core, with steel-tipped elbows, Ecclestone – like so many other tycoons – always wants to win. 'Show me a good loser,' he has said, 'and I'll show you a loser.' * Tom Bower is the author of No Angel: The Secret Life of Bernie Ecclestone .","Ecclestone, 83, was born in .

"By . Matthew Blake . This is the heart-stopping moment a truck travelling the wrong way along a motorway crashes headlong into a Ford Mustang, bursting into two of flame and killing both drivers. Jeremy Smeltzer, 29, was spotted careering along the left-hand side of U.S. 131, near Plainwell, Michigan, in a lorry just before midnight on April 15. Michigan troopers set off in pursuit, desperately trying to overtake and stop him before there was a serious accident. But they were too late. Scroll down for video .

"By . Jack Doyle . A triple killer has won an £800 payout because some of his belongings – including nasal hair clippers and a carton of cranberry juice – were damaged or lost in jail. Kevan Thakrar, 26, won £500 of the sum because officers did not apologise for the incident, which he claims left him ‘stressed’. Thakrar used a machine-gun to murder three men in a suburban home over a £10,000 drug debt and was jailed for 35 years in 2008. Behind bars, the gangster slashed three guards with a broken bottle. He is regarded as one of Britain’s most dangerous prisoners. Triple killer: Kevan Thakrar was jailed for murdering three men over a £10,000 cocaine debt . While he was being transferred from one prison to another, some of his possessions were misplaced. A pair of nasal hair clippers, a stereo and an alarm clock were  damaged, while personal papers, a carton of cranberry juice and some protein powder were lost. The killer claimed he was ‘stressed’ by the damage to the clippers, while some of the lost items were ‘priceless’. A judge ordered prison bosses to pay him £314.97 – as well as a further £500 to make up for the lost possessions and for failing to give the apology he demanded. Thakrar has since boasted on Facebook about a plan to send bailiffs to collect his cash from the Ministry of Justice. The payout provoked fury among his victims, including one of the prison officers stabbed by Thakrar. Craig Wylde, 32, who lost eight pints of blood after the attack, said the claim was laughable. He added: ‘It is another case of the prisoner getting everything and the real victims getting nothing. ‘He is always trying it on. This is the sort of person he is. He has to complain about everything and thinks he’s a big man because he’s challenging the system. This latest claim will have cost thousands and thousands of taxpayers’ money. It is just totally pathetic.’ Former Scots Guards Craig Wylde, a prison warder, lost eight pints of blood after being stabbed by thug Thakrar. He is still waiting to hear if he will receive compensation . Thakrar killed three men with a Mac 10 machine-gun in Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire. He would have shot two women as well, but his gun ran out of bullets – forcing him to use a knife. He and his brother Miran, then 24, made Keith Cowell, 52, his son Matthew Cowell, 17, and Tony Dulieu, 33, kneel on the floor, then shot them in a revenge plot over a cocaine deal. A 23-year-old woman was stabbed six times as she tried to protect her daughter, and another woman was hurt. Thakrar was jailed for three counts of murder, two of attempted murder and a firearms offence. As a result of attacking three guards, the killer was transferred from Frankland prison, in County Durham, pictured, to Woodhill in Milton Keynes . Behind bars he soon became a serial complainer, repeatedly bringing cases against the prison authorities. This is the second time he has successfully claimed for lost or damaged property. In 2012 he won an apology from the . prison ombudsman after authorities failed to investigate an alleged . attack on him by guards, and in 2010 he claimed that prison staff wrote . false entries on his files. The same year, he attacked three officers with a chili sauce bottle after barricading himself in his cell. Mr Wylde lost eight pints of blood when the jagged glass severed a major artery. graphic . Thakrar . shouted, ‘I’m going to kill you’, and stabbed a second officer, Claire . Lewis, in the back. A third officer tackled him, and Thakrar slashed his . face. He was charged with attempted murder, but cleared by a jury at Newcastle Crown Court. He argued that he had acted in  self-defence, as a pre-emptive strike after  suffering years of alleged racist bullying. As a result of the incident, he was transferred from Frankland prison, in County Durham, to Woodhill in Milton Keynes. In the move, some of his property was lost or damaged, and a prison ombudsman awarded him £10 in compensation. But Thakrar took the case to court and, in September last year, District Judge  Neil Hickman ruled that he was entitled  to a further payout. The judge said that there had been an ‘outrageous delay’ of 13 months in paying the £10 proposed by the ombudsman. He said it had ‘all the appearance of a calculated gesture’ by the Ministry of  Justice, and criticised the fact that no apology had been made. Thakrar at first claimed to have lost £100 of goods, but later upped this estimate to £230.01. The judge awarded him £90 for loss of property – on top of the £10 from the ombudsman – and £224.97 for the  damaged items. He also awarded an extra £500 because prison bosses refused to say sorry. He said: ‘Had the defendants said promptly and sincerely to Mr Thakrar that they deeply regretted the loss of his personal items and understood his distress, the loss of them would not have been aggravated in the way that it has been. ‘The Ministry has steadfastly failed even to tender the grudging and belated apology recommended by the ombudsman.’ Thakrar still updates his Facebook page from one of Britain’s top security prisons. In his most recent post on the social . networking site, he gloats about his money, and reveals that he . attempted to send bailiffs to collect it from Justice Secretary Chris . Grayling. The Justice for Kevan Thakrar Facebook page that claims he is a victim of a miscarriage of justice . He describes formally applying for a court enforcement order, before adding: ‘Although it may have been a few months late, Grayling paid up. It is a shame though – I was quite looking forward to the bailiffs going into the Ministry of Justice.’ By contrast, Mr Wylde has yet to learn if he will be compensated for his injuries. Last night, a Prison Service spokesman said: ‘We robustly defend all cases as far as the evidence allows.’","Kevan Thakran used a machine-gun to murder three men over drug debt .

William Henwood, of Enfield, north London, made the comment on Twitter in response to a speech by Henry in which he said ethnic minorities were under-represented on British TV. The 66-year-old - who has since defended his tweet about Henry, but has also posted in the past comparing Islam to the Third Reich - is standing in next month's local council elections in Enfield. Scroll down for video . Comments: William Henwood (left), of Enfield, north London, made the comment on Twitter in response to a speech by Lenny Henry (right) in which he said ethnic minorities were under-represented on British TV . Mr Henwood - who claims on his Google+ page to have studied at a college in South Africa in 1968 - tweeted of Henry: ‘He should emigrate to a black country. He does not have to live with whites.’ Defending the remark, he later told the BBC: ‘I think if black people come to this country and don't like mixing with white people why are they here? ‘If he (Henry) wants a lot of blacks around go and live in a black country.’ On another occasion, Mr Henwood tweeted: ‘Islam reminds me of the 3rd Reich Strength through violence against the citizens.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the comments on Henry were racist. He told Pienaar's Politics on BBC Radio 5 Live: ‘I do think those comments about Lenny Henry were absolutely disgusting. ‘[And] it's for Nigel Farage to make absolutely clear that it's not Ukip's official view, but also to explain why so many people with those kinds of view seem to be attracted to becoming candidates for Ukip.’ Explanataion: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (left) said that Ukip leader Nigel Farage (right) must 'explain why so many people with those kinds of view seem to be attracted to becoming candidates' for the party . Asked if he thought the comments were racist, Mr Hunt replied: ‘Yes I do. I think it is and that's why I'd like to hear a very clear denunciation of that from Nigel Farage. The son of Jamaican immigrants, Henry grew up in Dudley, West Midlands. Lenry Henry is now probably best known to television audiences for advertising a chain of budget hotels. The 55-year-old first came to the public's attention in 1975 when he was a teenage impressionist on the ITV talent show New Faces, hosted by Derek Hobson. He delighted audiences with his impersonations of, among others, Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em's Frank Spencer and Liberal MP, author and TV dog food salesman Clement Freud. Henry then worked on LWT sitcom The Fosters and joined Chris Tarrant on Tiswas. In the 1980s, he was given his own show by the BBC. He later starred in BBC sitcom Chef but his TV career has waned in recent years and his most regular appearance is on Premier Inn adverts. In 2010 he divorced from the comedienne Dawn French after 25 years of marriage. 'I think it's totally unacceptable and (Henry) is as British as you and I are.’ Told the comments had been denounced by a Ukip MEP, Mr Hunt added: ‘Good. 'I'd really like to see that because I think there is a broader risk for Ukip here because they position themselves as the patriotic party, they plaster the Union Jack all over their leaflets but actually there's something very un-British about this kind of language, very unpleasant. ‘We are not a divisive country. We want to be a country - all parts of the political spectrum - where we avoid that kind of rhetoric and I think that's where there are some real dangers for Ukip.’ Ukip deputy chairman Neil Hamilton, a former Tory MP, said the comments on Henry were a ‘complete distraction’ from the European election campaign, adding Mr Henwood's case would be investigated. He told Pienaar's Politics: ‘This is a council candidate whom you would have never have heard but for all the social media archaeologists that are employed by Labour, the Liberal party and the Tories to try and track down any unknown Ukip member or activist who may have said something unpleasant on social media. ‘Every party has got them. We have strict rules on racism. We don't allow it. Other case: Last week builder Andre Lampitt, seeking to become a councillor in Merton, south London,  was suspended by Ukip after making racist remarks on Twitter that the party said were 'repellent' 'We're the only party that doesn't allow ex-BNP or National Front members to be candidates and we have strict rules on social media. I know because I helped to devise them. This man's case will be investigated.’ Henry said earlier this month that he wanted the public to join his campaign to put more ethnic minorities on the screen. He has been engaged in private discussions with Ed Vaizey, the Culture minister, and senior broadcasting figures, Lord Hall, the BBC Director General and Peter Fincham, the chief executive of ITV, to discuss his campaign to put more ethnic minorities on the screen. Henry - who wants the public to force politicians to make the change - has been campaigning on the issue for six years and is hopeful that change is imminent. He said: ‘There will be a call to arms. Nothing happens without conflict and this is our time to stop moaning to ourselves and to take the argument public. ‘All of those people in the audience who watch those shows and complain that there aren’t enough black and Asian [people], and gay and women and people with disabilities and transgender… they need to start lobbying, to start writing letters, they need to start emailing.' Mr Henwood - who says on his Facebook page that he studied at Middlesex University and Damelin Collage in Johannesburg - lives on a road with an average house value of £326,000. His comments were reported after Ukip launched an investigation into another of its aspiring politicians last night after apparently homophobic and racist comments came to light. On March 29, the day gay marriage was made legal in the UK, Robert Bilcliff, who is standing to be a councillor in Tamworth, Staffordshire, took to Twitter to declare: ‘Sad day for all us straight people.’ A separate Facebook post in July 2012 allegedly made a joke against Muslims. Mr Bilcliff admitted he could see how his comments could be viewed as homophobic and racist, but said he was neither. He said: ‘I have many friends of different nationalities but I enjoy a joke every now and again.’ A UKIP spokesman said the matter had been referred to the party’s national executive with a view to disciplinary action. Last week builder Andre Lampitt, seeking to become a councillor in Merton, south London, and who featured in a UKIP election broadcast, was suspended after making racist remarks on Twitter that the party said were ‘repellent’.","William Henwood, of Enfield, north London, made comment on Twitter .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . A hotel owner doubled the price of wedding receptions at the last minute - and then branded couples who could not afford the hike 'chavs'. Alice Tarry, 49, left dozens of brides-to-be devastated after she drastically raised the cost of hiring the posh Walton Hotel in Nottingham. In some cases, the price had more than doubled - with one bill seeing the cost of restaurant hire soar from £250 to £1,000. Sparking anger: Alice Tarry, 49, left dozens of brides-to-be devastated after she drastically raised the cost of hiring the Walton Hotel in Nottingham. Above, Ms Tarry is pictured with her millionaire husband, David Shelton . Hotel: She gave couples the choice of paying the new rates or cancelling their bookings at the hotel (pictured) Ms Tarry, who took over the three-star hotel in February, gave engaged couples the choice of paying the revised rates or cancelling their bookings. Many were forced to cancel the venue just weeks before their big day, while others had to scrap their honeymoons too because of the short notice. Ms Tarry later took to Facebook to answer complaints about the price hike - and called couples who could not afford it 'chavs'. Some of the price hikes at the Walton Hotel in Nottingham include: Restaurant hire: £250 to £1,000.Ten bottles of Prosecco: £199.50 to £299.50.Evening barbecue buffet: £1,196 to £1,600.Service charge: £150 to £507.08. The new owner, who is married to David Shelton, the millionaire boss of UK car supermarket Motorpoint, wrote: 'Really need your support. Please . check and befriend the Walton Hotel, Nottingham. 'Would you please checkout the backlash from the wedding chavs. I need a thumbs up on my comment as support.' Heather Sulley, 26, was planning to hold her wedding reception at the hotel on August 16 when she received an email saying the cost had risen from £5,190 to £7,751. Now, she and her fiancé Darren Smith, 31, have been forced to cancel their plans - and may also have to scrap their honeymoon to Mexico. Ms Sulley, from Carlton, Nottingham, said: 'When I got the email my heart sank. The new owner said that she had taken over and that the price had gone up and the rooms had also gone up to between £110 and £160, even though we had agreed £70. 'I emailed back asking her to call me and she never did. It would have been easier to speak to the Queen than the owner. Disappointed: Heather Sulley, 26, was planning to hold her wedding reception at the hotel in August when she received an email saying the cost had risen from £5,190 to £7,751. Above, Ms Sulley and fiancé, Darren Smith . 'I was eventually sent a new inventory last Friday night and I broke down in tears because everything had gone up by £2,500. 'My mum found the Facebook comment and made us aware. It really upset her. We felt her [Ms Tarry] and her friends were laughing at us. 'We have managed to secure another place but we've had to find extra money which is jeopardising our honeymoon. We don't think we can afford it.' Upmarket: In some cases, the price of hiring the venue had more than doubled - with one bill seeing the cost of restaurant hire soar from £250 to £1,000 . Other customers claimed Ms Tarry had failed to give an explanation as to why the the fees had been increased at such short notice. Web designer Christopher Dowson and his bride-to-be Clare Gunning were asked to pay an extra £1,500 for their reception, which was due to take place next Saturday. The 33-year-old, of Netherfield, Nottingham, said: 'It took us several weeks to track down the new price and when we did we saw that everything was much more expensive. 'We had agreed on £3,000 and that went up to £4,500 - I do not know how they can justify this behaviour.' Ms Tarry married Mr Shelton at the luxury four-star Rushton Hall in Northamptonshire in front of 100 guests in December 2012, before going on a honeymoon in Thailand. The couple now live in a sprawling Grade II-listed farmhouse, worth £1million, in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire. The hotel owner has refused to apologise for the price hike, which came into effect last week, but has admitted her Facebook post was 'inappropriate'. 'I'd like to personally apologise for any distress and inconvenience this has caused. It has been a difficult situation for all concerned,' she said. 'As new owners of The Walton, we are passionate about ensuring it remains one of Nottingham city centre's best-loved independent hotels, and, in order to do this, we have had make some changes so it can be a sustainable and successful business in the future. 'This means we have had to discuss some previously agreed rates with some customers. We have offered a full refund or new rates to the couples affected in line with the terms and conditions of their agreements, and have personally discussed their options with them.

"By . Brendan Carlin, Mail on Sunday Political Reporter . Ed Miliband is facing a Shadow Cabinet ‘cost of living’ revolt after spending more than £20,000 of public money taking ‘an army of aides’ on an overseas trip. The Labour leader sparked anger among senior colleagues for sanctioning a three-day visit by a 12-strong delegation to Israel and the West Bank earlier this month. Apart from Mr Miliband and his wife Justine, the party included no fewer than eight Labour officials as well as Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander and Labour peer Stewart Wood. Labour leader Ed (centre) and his wife Justine Miliband (right) visit the Khan al-Ahmar Bedouin community in the West Bank . They are understood to have racked up a bill of more than £20,000, including business-class flights for the Milibands as well as five-star hotels for his entourage. In contrast, Tory sources claim that when David Cameron was Opposition leader, he often used to travel with no more than three or four aides. Last night, Labour frontbenchers privately condemned the ‘lavish’ spending. One said: ‘This  was an important trip and  no one would begrudge Ed from making it. ‘But did he really have to travel with this sort of presidential-style entourage and an army of party flunkeys?

Foreign trips such as this are usually paid for with so-called ‘Short Money’ – the annual taxpayer-funded subsidy  given to Labour to carry out its Opposition duties. Mr Miliband’s office said last night: ‘This was a big and important trip and an appropriate number of people were on it. 'All those from Labour on the trip were funded from the leader’s office in the normal way.’","Labour leader took 12-strong delegation to Israel and West Bank .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . and Chris Pleasance . A Subway restaurant in Chicago has installed a bulletproof glass screen to keep their employees safe, just as the city's police chief insisting the homicide rate has gone down. The 24-hour sandwich shop, on the city's south side, has put up a glass barrier around the serving area, including a revolving door hatch for staff to pass food through. The news comes on the same day that police chief Garry McCarthy praised his force for keeping homicides down to their lowest level - 415 last year - since 1965. A Subway restaurant on Chicago's south side has put up a bulletproof glass screen around the service counter to protect staff in America's 'murder capital' That figure was an 18 per cent drop on 2012 and he said this year's rate is 'still ahead of where we were last year'. That is despite a spate of violence over the Easter weekend which left nine people dead and another 36 wounded, including six children aged 11 to 15. It is not known exactly what prompted the Subway enclosure to be put up, and when contacted by Mail Online, a member of restaurant staff refused to comment. Speaking to WGN Radio's Steve Cochran, Supt McCarthy said: 'A week doesn't wipe out two years of progress. 'We always knew that we're going to have good days and we're going to have bad days, we've just got to make sure we're having more good days than bad.' The barrier was put up as Gerry McCarthy, the city's Police Chief, announced that the homicide rate has dropped - despite a spate of violence over the Easter weekend . Nine people were killed and 36 injured in 48 hours over the weekend, including five children aged 11 to 15 who were shot in a drive-by, and another 15-year-old girl shot while she was in a car (file pic) He praised officers for 'getting out in front of the shootings' but told CNN it would take time for the improvements to be felt. In the latest round of violence five children were shot in a drive-by on Sunday night after a person in a vehicle reportedly asked if the children were members of a particular street gang, then opened fire. A sixth youngster, a 15-year-old girl, was shot while riding in a vehicle in what appears to be a separate gang-related incident. Supt McCarthy highlighted the Easter killings to call for more gun control laws. 'It's just insanity that there's such a proliferation of firearms that they're so easy to get your hands on,' Supt McCarthy told WGN Radio . 'The studies show when there's more restrictive gun laws, there's less gun violence. It's not brain surgery, it's really really simple. 'It's going to take us a while to fix poverty and the break-up of the family units and education and jobs. But we can do something about gun laws today and we're just not doing it.'","Restaurant on city's south side installed glass shield to protect staff .

"By . Paul Donnelley . Paedophiles will be given the same treatment as terrorists under a crackdown on child abuse to be included in the Queen's Speech. David Cameron said that he wanted to close a loophole that allows sexual predators to create and possess ‘manuals’ giving tips on how to identify victims, groom them and evade capture. In future, they will face the same kind of sanctions as extremists who download guides to bomb-making. The Government wants to crack down on paedophiles owning or creating 'manuals' that teach them how to groom children (Picture posed by model) The issue came to light after GCHQ and the National Crime Agency found online examples of the guides in the chaotic part of cyberspace known as the ‘dark web’ or 'deep web'. This is where tens of trillions of pages that most people have never seen are stored. They include everything from statistics to the illegal sale of human body parts. The Prime Minister told The Sunday Times: ‘It's completely unacceptable that there is a loophole in the law which allows paedophiles to write and distribute these disgusting documents. ‘I want to ensure we do everything we can to protect children – and that's why I am making them illegal.’ The new law is expected to be in force by the time of next year’s General Election, and could be implemented in an amendment to the Obscene Publications Act 1959, according to the newspaper. The Terrorism Act 2000 outlawed terrorist training manuals. The move was announced after it emerged that a paedophile teacher drugged and abused up to 60 boys as young as 10 at a British private school. William Vahey, who taught history and geography at Southbank International School in London between 2009 and 2013, committed suicide last month as FBI agents closed in.

"By . Mark Duell . A Celine Dion fan who made his neighbours' lives a misery by blasting out My Heart Will Go On has had his iPod and speakers taken away, it was revealed today. Gareth Davies, 47, of Strood, Kent, was targeted by council officers after locals complained he was blaring out tunes including the classic ballad from the 1997 film Titanic at top volume. After he breached a noise order six times, council officers with a warrant seized thousands of pounds worth of equipment from the former window salesman’s home. Favourite: My Heart Will Go On by Celine Dion (pictured) was blasted out by Gareth Davies at his home in Kent . Movie hit: Dion's song was made famous in the 1997 film Titanic, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet . They included his 3D TV, a laptop, speakers, a sound docking station with iPod, 32 DVDs, CDs and a PlayStation 3. Officers had witnessed music being played in the afternoon and early evening. Other songs on his playlist included James Brown's Sex Machine, Apache Indian's Boom Shack-A-Lak, Steppenwolf's Born To Be Wild and You've Got A Friend In Me from the 1995 film Toy Story. The equipment is now in storage and after 28 days Mr Davies, who has been living in the £80,000 Victorian terraced house since 1988, can apply for its return. He said: ‘I don't understand why the council have changed their policy on this issue. That's why I ignored the notice - I thought I'd get the chance to defend myself.’ Mr Davies added that it was a horrible experience and estimated the council had removed £3,000 of equipment.

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A Marks & Spencer worker went to drive home after finishing her shift only to find the entire front end of her car had been stolen. Anne Eveleigh, 58, from Dinas Powys, Cardiff, was stunned to discover the bumper, bonnet and headlights had been taken from her silver Ford Fiesta in broad daylight on Friday. The vehicle, which she had left in the staff car park of the store in Culverhouse Cross, Cardiff, will need around £2,000 worth of repairs to get it back on the road. It is thought the audacious criminals struck at some point in the afternoon, as the car was still in tact when the worker went on her lunch break. However, as the car park was not covered by CCTV, it will be hard to determine an exact time. Anne Eveleigh, 58, left work to discover the bumper, bonnet and headlights (pictured) had been taken from her Ford Fiesta while it was parked in the staff car park . It is thought repairs to the car to get it back on the road will cost in the region of £2,000 . Mrs Eveleigh's mechanic husband Stephen, . 61, said: 'She was quite upset - the Fiesta was stripped of the front . end while in the staff car park. 'We asked Marks & Spencer to check their CCTV but the staff car park is not covered by the cameras. 'Someone must have seen whoever did this walking off with a bonnet, bumper and headlights.' ''I'm a mechanic myself so when my wife phoned and said the bonnet had been stolen. I told her just to drive it home and I would fix it. 'But then she said she couldn't as the lights had gone too, and the bumper, so it's completely undrivable.' He told Wales Online: 'I drove down there, and I asked the store manager to get the CCTV while we were waiting for the police, in the hope that they might be able to trace them, but we were gob-smacked when he said there was none. The theft took place outside the M&S store in Culverhouse Cross, Cardiff (pictured) at some point after lunch . 'She was parked in the area designated for staff, so I think they should be held responsible. That’s where they’ve been told to park and they have an obligation to look after their staff. 'I can’t believe that no-one saw anything - it’s a busy car park and it was in broad daylight. For someone who knows what they’re doing, it’s a 20 to 25 minute job, so someone must have noticed them. 'I’ve priced the parts and for those alone it’s going to cost £1,000 plus VAT, so it’s going to cost us well over £2,000.' South Wales police confirmed they are investigating the theft.

"By . Richard Barber . Sugar sickness: Cara Dillon had all the signs of diabetes, but thought she was just 'stressed' The symptoms pointed to a text-book case of diabetes: unexplained sudden weight loss,  an unquenchable thirst, a craving for sugary food, and a life-sapping exhaustion that left Cara Dillon too tired to lift her baby twin boys. Yet the Irish folk singer simply put the gradually growing list of problems down to ‘tour stress’. Cara was 31 at the time, in 2007, and had been a healthy size eight her whole adult life, always about eight stone. But, a year before, she had given birth prematurely to twins Noah and Colm, going into labour while performing on stage in Swindon – and felt she had never ‘bounced back’. She explains: ‘We were on tour in Northern Ireland – I’m from Derry – and I was exhausted. I was eating the same as usual but then got a craving for chocolate muffins and doughnuts. And I was constantly thirsty. ‘My clothes were hanging off me. When I weighed myself, I was under six stone. 'The crunch came when we got back home to Somerset . 'I crossed the room to lift one of the boys out of his cot and I couldn’t pick him up. I was so weak. 'My husband, Sam, put his foot down. It was time I went to the doctor.’ Cara was immediately referred  to the Bath hospital where the twins were born. Later that day she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Cara says: ‘I felt my body had let me down. For three days, I was cast into a deep depression, almost as though I was in mourning. I thought I’d have to give up my career. How could I tour? How could I look after the boys properly? 'And I certainly wasn’t going to be injecting myself three or four times a day. It’s impossible to prove this, but one consultant said my immune system had taken a bit of a battering following my emergency caesarean. So that could have acted as a trigger for my autoimmune system to stop functioning properly.’ There are 3.2 million diabetics in the UK, ten per cent with type 1. Diabetes affects the body’s ability to process glucose, the molecule most carbohydrates are broken down into by digestion before passing into the bloodstream. The hormone insulin is produced to help this sugar enter cells, where it is used for energy. Dietician Douglas Twenefour, clinical adviser for Diabetes UK, explains: ‘People develop type 1 diabetes because the immune system attacks the cells that naturally produce insulin. We still don’t understand why. Typically, this form of diabetes occurs in people under 40, quite often in children once they reach double figures.’ In type 2 diabetes, usually linked to obesity, the gland that produces insulin – the pancreas – stops working. Although it is not fully understood, some studies suggest that a virus or other environmental stress might trigger this. New lease: Cara, pictured holding Noah with Sam and Colm at the piano, dropped two stone and was too tired to pick up her own children before she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes . The acute symptoms that Cara experienced – frequent urination, increased thirst, blurred vision and extreme tiredness – are a result of sugar building up to damaging levels in the blood, affecting the function of all organs. Last year Home Secretary Theresa May revealed she had been diagnosed with type 1 aged 56 – ending speculation about her dramatic weight loss. Singer Susan Boyle has also been affected as an adult. Once, type 1 diabetes was fatal but regular injections of synthetic insulin mean it is now easy to manage. Cara says: ‘On the fourth morning my depression gave way to determination. I wasn’t going to let this thing beat me. I wasn’t going to die of diabetes; I was going to live with it. ‘We were due to tour Europe and America. So I asked the consultant how to cope with the time zones. Normally, she said, she’d recommend a week-long course to teach me how to count my carbohydrate intake. Helping hand: It was Cara's husband Sam who made her go to the doctor in 2007 . 'But she arranged a half-day crash course. Then I bought scales to weigh the food and work out the carbs. I became pretty obsessive, eliminating everything with added sugar. But I realised this was the diabetes controlling me. ‘So I worked out how much insulin I’d need depending on what I planned to eat and then had whatever I wanted, which might include a couple of glasses of wine.’ Cara injects herself ten minutes before a meal and once each evening at 10pm to last through the night. ‘I never thought I’d be able to do it but it’s amazing what you get used to,’ she says. If she’s doing a gig, though, she has to adjust her insulin levels. Performing increases adrenaline which raises blood sugar levels. ‘I have to compensate with an injection before I need it to take account of the adrenaline rush that will kick in as soon as I start singing. Get it wrong and it starts making my voice go wobbly.’ In October 2010, her daughter Elizabeth was born. ‘I had to have very tight blood glucose control throughout the pregnancy because your sugar levels are so random as your hormones are all over the place. I have a small device to test the level. ‘Your blood sugar level should be around five. Being pregnant made  it shoot up, which is why I needed regular insulin. But if it falls too low, you risk a hypoglycaemic attack and blacking out. I had to have a blood test every six weeks.’ At 38 weeks, Elizabeth was delivered by caesarean weighing a healthy 7lb 14oz. Although type 1 diabetes is not  an inherited disease, a first-degree relative is six times more likely to develop it. Cara’s children are currently all well, but she adds: ‘I had a cousin who died of the condition.’ ‘This will sound odd,’ she says,  ‘but I honestly think diabetes has made me a better person. I’m certainly much more disciplined.’ And the career that was nearly killed off by her debilitating illness? With a new album just recorded and a tour of China around the corner, it’s looking better than ever. lA Thousand Hearts, by Cara Dillon, is released on May 19.

While most pre-schoolers are more interested with the contents of their toy chest than the catwalks, one  three-year-old girl loves shoes so much she already owns more than 35 pairs. Little Amelia Milsom-McQuillan got hooked on shoes after trying on her mothers' heels and parading up and down the hallway at home. The fashion-mad girl - who wears a size nine - quickly built up an impressive collection worth hundreds of pounds. At the tender age of three, Amelia Milsom-McQuillan owns 35 pairs of shoes- more than most grown women . All Amelia's friends and family know about her shoe obsession, and buy them for her as birthday and Christmas presents. Mother Gemma Milsom-McQuillan, 27, says the fashion fan can't walk past fancy footwear in shop windows and spends all her pocket money on them. Now the 105cm tall youngster has put her best foot forward as a model - stepping out on the catwalk before she's even started school. She's one of the faces of children's shoes Start-rite and has starred in a fashion show and photoshoot in London. Mrs Milsom-McQuillan, a mental health worker, said: 'Amelia's always loved shoes ever since she was born. Despite blossoming modelling career, Amelia has plans to be a doctor when she grows up . 'Even as a baby she used to play with mine and my partner Sarah's shoes and put them on to teeter up and down the hall at home. 'Having two mums means there's a lot of shoes in the house to catch her eye. 'Amelia's very girly and is obsessed with shoes already - she loves pink and can't resist anything pink and sparkly. 'As soon as she could walk she started trying all our heels and sandals on. 'Her favourite phrase as a toddler was '"" want to try on your wedding shoes"", to describe our going-out shoes. 'Her favourites were my red stilletoes and I'll never forget her tottering around in them and almost breaking her neck. 'Amelia's got more than 35 pairs of shoes and whenever we're out shopping and she spots a pair on the shelf she stops me and asks to try them on. 'She's got everything from dressing-up shoes and party shoes to boots and different coloured Converse, all stored in coloured boxes in her bedroom. 'At the moment she adores the Disney film Frozen and so any shoes that look princessy go down a treat. 'All her pocket money and any gift vouchers she's given as presents goes towards her shoe fund.' Mrs Milsom-McQuillan, from Copnor, Portsmouth, filmed Amelia modelling a pair of silver glittery pumps to enter the competition to be a shoe model. It caught the judge's eye, and Amelia joined 15 other children for a three-hour modelling session. The three-year-old can't walk past fancy footwear in shop windows and spends all her pocket money on them . Mrs Milsom-McQuillan said her daughter loved twirling around in three different outfits - summer, winter and school. The mother-of-one said: 'Amelia's always loved the camera so when I saw this opportunity, we went for it. 'Our video was about a minute long and just showed Amelia walking up and down and doing a little pose. 'Amelia loved being a model for the first time - the whole thing was really relaxed and there was no pressure. 'The team put a bit of eye shadow and glitter on the girls so that they felt like they were getting a special treatment. 'They had their pictures taken by a photographer and tried on different outfits and hats while they walked up and down a catwalk. 'Amelia really enjoyed her first taste of modelling, made a new best friend and was delighted when she got a free pair of shoes at the end of the day.' 'She talks about the fashion show a lot and told the staff at her nursery 'I'm a model now, I'm all grown up'. 'That had them in stitches.' Amelia's parents, Mrs Milsom-McQuillan and her civil partner Sarah, 31, a nurse, say they would be happy for Amelia to return to the catwalk. But they don't want it to get in the way of her education - the talented girl has set her sights on becoming a doctor.","Amelia's love of shoes means she spends all her pocket money on them .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 65-year-old ex-soldier is demanding a £20,000 sex change operation on the NHS. Roxanne Yeatman - formerly Doug - is having ‘feminisation’ lessons and now wants surgery as well. The father-of-four, who was a Gunner in the Royal Artillery, says she was ‘born in the wrong body’. Roxanne Yeatman, 65, formerly called Doug, wants £20,000 sex change surgery on the NHS because she was 'born in the wrong body' She’s been learning to walk, talk and act like a woman at the Gender Identity Clinic at Charing Cross Hospital, London, and has been taking female hormones for two years. ‘I need this operation to be who I want to be,’ said Ms Yeatman, from Thamesmead, South East London. ‘I am just living day-to-day waiting for when I can get it done.’ Ms Yeatman, a retired security guard, joined the army at 16 and was a Gunner in the Royal Artillery for three years before being dishonourably discharged in 1968 for theft. She moved to London and admits falling in with the wrong crowd, leading to time in prison, including a 28-month stretch in Wandsworth Prison. Ms Yeatman is having 'feminisation' lessons and has been taking female hormones for two years . Now her only focus is on transforming her body and she hopes to get the go ahead from her consultant for the £15,000 operation. The total bill for her treatment, including drugs and counselling will come to £20,000. She said: ‘He needs to see how I get on to make sure my mind and body are ready, because once it’s done there’s no turning back.” ‘I used to play with the girls rather than the boys when I was little. ‘I was married 21 years then I thought the grass was greener on the other side. ‘It wasn’t bad for that time but something went wrong and then I thought I will be what I want to be now.’ Ms Yeatman used to be called Doug and was a Gunner in the Royal Artillery before becoming a security guard . Ms Yeatman is hoping to have the six-hour reassignment surgery done on the NHS and says she will be ‘very relieved’ when it’s done. She said: ‘My family haven’t got anything bad to say about it, it’s down to me. ‘They don’t mind and it’s nothing to do with them really. My middle daughter says “it’s down to you dad - it’s your life and your body”.’ She added: ‘They recommend listening to Cher to get your pitch right. ‘It’s very difficult and it plays havoc with your throat, but practice makes perfect.’","Roxanne Yeatman is having 'feminisation' lessons and taking hormones .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . A Birmingham school at the heart of an alleged Islamist plot to take over state institutions allowed students to express 'positive views' about terrorism, it has been claimed. Park View School in Alum Rock, which is under investigation over the 'Trojan Horse' plot, allegedly failed to challenge children's opinions about the 7/7 and 9/11 atrocities due to 'cultural sensitivity'. It also reportedly advised staff not to bring soldiers into the school for visits, while one employee allegedly spoke of wanting an 'Islamic state', according to the British Humanist Association. Allegations: Park View School in Alum Rock allegedly allowed students to speak 'positively' about terrorism . Assembly: The school reportedly failed to challenge some children's opinions about the 7/7 and 9/11 atrocities because of 'cultural sensitivity'. Above, an assembly to prepare pupils for Ramadan is held at Park View School . The allegations were made by 'several' of the maths and science academy's former employees, who have only recently chosen to make them public, said the Association. Other claims against the school include: . Humanist: Pavan Dhaliwal, the British Humanist Association's Head of Public Affairs, said it is 'vital' that all state schools 'foster an environment inclusive of every child' regardless of religion . The Association, a charity promoting a secular state and equal treatment regardless of religion, said some of the allegations dated back to 2011. However, the whistleblower who made contact at the time decided not to press for action, it said. Former Park View employees subsequently contacted the charity in January this year - resulting in contact with the original complainant. The Association said the findings of its own investigation into the school's RE . teachings were passed to the Department for Education and Ofsted on . January 31. Park View Education Trust, which runs the school in Alum Rock, has defended the institution, saying its curriculum 'makes clear that the basis of all sexual relationships is informed consent'. It added that claims that male pupils were informed via a worksheet that wives had to give sex to their husbands were 'categorically untrue', while the school has not yet received any complaints in relation to the Creationism acccusations. Inquiry: On Wednesday, the names of 18 schools at the centre of the alleged 'Trojan Horse' plot were revealed in a list by Birmingham City Council. Above, one of the schools, Gracelands Nursery School in Sparkbrook . Under investigation: The allegations came to light earlier this year. Above, Adderley Primary School in Saltley . The trust has not yet commented specifically on allegations that it failed to challenge some children's opinions about terrorism. Pavan . Dhaliwal, the Association's Head of Public Affairs, said: 'It is vital . that all our state schools teach a broad and balanced curriculum, . actively contribute to community cohesion and foster an environment . inclusive of every child, parent and member of staff, regardless of . their religious or non-religious beliefs.' Three . separate investigations are currently under way over claims that hardline Islamists are seizing control of government bodies, segregating male and female pupils and banning sex education. One school is even being investigated over . allegations that the al Qaeda-linked Muslim preacher Anwar al-Awlaki, . who died in a U.S. drone strike in Yemen in 2011, was praised in . assembly. Allegations: One of the schools allegedly . praised al Qaeda-linked preacher Anwar al-Awlaki (left) in assembly. Right, Sir Albert Bore, council leader, said Ofsted would likely not . publish its final inspection reports until May . The inquiries are being carried out by Ofsted, the Government and Birmingham City Council. On Wednesday, the names of 18 schools at the centre of the allegedly plot were revealed in a list by the city council. As well as Park View, they include Gracelands Nursery school in Sparkbrook and Golden Hillock School in Sparkhill. Request: Three separate inquiries are currently under way into the 'Trojan Horse' plot. Ofsted inspections are being carried out at the direct request of Education Secretary Michael Gove . They also feature Adderley Primary School, Highfield Junior and Infant School, Nansen Primary, Alston Primary School and Saltley School and Specialist Science College, all in Saltley, Birmingham. Earlier this week, Sir Albert Bore, council leader, said Ofsted was not intending to publish its final inspection reports until 'the first or second week of May'. He added that he has not yet seen the draft version of the inspection reports, which have been carried out at the request of Education Secretary Michael Gove. The . councilâ€™s investigation is being headed by former headteacher Ian . Kershaw, who is sifting through about 200 concerns raised since the . alleged 'Trojan Horse' plot emerged. Park View Education Trust said in a statement: 'Park View Academy has a clear curriculum policy which governs the teaching of all subjects within the school. 'Our . sex and relationships education (SRE) is taught in single sex groups . and makes clear that the basis of all sexual relationships is informed . consent. 'After . a lesson that took place around 2011 it became clear to the school that . boys had misunderstood a historical reference to do with cultural . expectations of sex within marriage. 'As soon as the school became aware that this was the case it took immediate action and held a special assembly for Year 10 boys to make it clear that sex without informed consent is rape. 'The allegation that boys were informed via a worksheet that wives have to give sex to their husbands is categorically untrue. The . teaching of Creationism in Science is not school policy. 'Without . having received any complaints in relation to the allegation that . Creationism has been taught it is very difficult for us to comment . further.

"By . Emma Innes . A great-grandmother with a broken pelvis was left in a hospital toilet for more than an hour after staff forgot about her. Annie Stanley was admitted to Northampton General Hospital following a fall at home earlier this month. The 87-year-old widow said she was happy with her care until she was taken to the bathroom by a healthcare assistant on April 16. Annie Stanley (pictured with her daughter, Gwen Greenaway), 87, was left for more than an hour in a hospital toilet after staff forgot she was there . When the pensioner - who suffers from claustrophobia - called to say she was ready to come out, nobody answered from the other side of the cubicle. She then tried to pull on the emergency cord but it was broken - leaving her trapped in the toilet for an hour and 20 minutes. Shockingly, the only way she escaped was to crawl 10ft to the door to unlock it herself despite being in excruciating pain. She then shouted down the corridor for help before a member of staff finally heard her cries for help and found her stranded on the floor. Mrs Stanley, who is now recovering at home in Hardingstone, Northamptonshire, said: ‘I was just waiting and waiting, pulling on the cord. ‘I thought “this can’t be working”. I got to the door and managed to unlock it, don’t ask me how I did it. When she realised there was no one outside to help her, Mrs Stanley tried pulling the emergency cord but it was broken. Eventually, she crawled to the toilet door and opened it herself . ‘Then I shouted down the corridor, but no-one could hear me. ‘I thought I would never get out. I thought nobody was coming for me.’ Now Mrs Stanley’s furious family are demanding to know why the member of staff didn’t check on her and left her alone for so long. They also want the hospital to check its emergency cords on a daily basis rather than its current monthly inspections. Her daughter, Julia Stanley, 67, said the consequences could have been much worse because her mother is claustrophobic and has a weak heart. Even when she had unlocked the door, Mrs Stanley had to shout for help until someone came to find her . She added: ‘She lives alone, but this has really knocked her confidence.’ Staff only began to search for Mrs Stanley when her daughter began to worry where she was and at first they thought she was in the physiotherapy ward. The family think the problem occurred because healthcare assistants on the ward are moved elsewhere in the hospital at 2pm and it was at this time that Mrs Stanley was in the bathroom. Northampton General Hospital confirmed bosses are investigating and apologised to the family for the distress caused. A spokesperson said: ‘We are very sorry to hear this report about Mrs Stanley’s care, and apologise for the distress this must have caused her. 'We are investigating this incident in detail but would like to assure the public that our staff care very deeply about the welfare of their patients and are extremely upset that this has happened. 'We will do everything in our power to ensure that something similar cannot happen again. We have also taken immediate action by implementing an audit programme to ensure that we can evidence regular testing of all emergency bells and call bells on a daily basis. 'We are determined to show that this incident is not indicative of the general standard of care at Northampton General Hospital. 'We are pleased to say that the Care Quality Commission, who recently carried out a thorough inspection of the hospital, made a point of noting that all our staff were judged to be caring, and we are very proud of that assessment. We continue to aim to provide the best possible care for our patients.'","Annie Stanley was admitted to Northampton General Hospital after a fall .

"By . Emma Innes . More than a third of people wrongly believe being HIV positive prevents someone from working as a nursery school teacher, chef or with people with mental illnesses, according to new research. Findings from a poll taken by 5,000 people showed that the public are ‘in the dark’ about the realities of living with human immunodeficiency (HIV) virus, the National Aids Trust (NAT) said. The survey findings, released on the 30th anniversary of the discovery of the HIV virus, showed one in five, or 20 per cent, of the public wrongly believe that people with HIV can only expect to live for 10 years after acquiring the virus, even if they are on treatment and not diagnosed late. More than a third of people wrongly believe that people who are HIV positive are not allowed to be chefs or nursery school teachers (file picture) Only 16 per cent of respondents correctly stated that people with HIV can expect to have a normal life expectancy when they are being successfully treated and are not diagnosed late. The research also showed that more than a third (36 per cent) of people wrongly thought that being HIV positive prevented someone from working as a nursery school teacher, a chef or with people with mental health problems. The charity said the only job that someone HIV positive cannot do is work in the front-line armed forces, a ban applying to anyone with a long-term medical condition that requires daily medication. Dentists, surgeons and midwives who are HIV positive can practice as long as they are monitored and their ‘viral load’ - the level of the HIV virus in their blood - remains undetectable, the charity said. A quarter of those surveyed, or 26 per cent, thought it was illegal not to disclose your HIV status to your beauty therapist, your GP, your tattooist, your dentist, your employer, or someone you are marrying. The NAT said there is no legal requirement to disclose your HIV status to anyone, except in very few specific jobs such as dentists, surgeons and midwives. Only 16 per cent of people realise that people who are HIV positive can have a normal life expectancy. Image shows HIV in human tissue . Other findings from the research included that only five per cent of those surveyed knew that the chance of passing on HIV through unprotected sex is ‘virtually nil’ if someone is doing well on treatment. Aids is the final stage of HIV infection, when the body can no longer fight life-threatening infections. With early diagnosis and effective treatment, most people with HIV will not go on to develop Aids. The charity said an estimated 100,000 people are HIV positive in the UK, of whom around 22,000 are thought to be undiagnosed. Deborah Jack, NAT chief executive, said: ‘Thanks to effective treatment, the situation for someone who is diagnosed with HIV today is a world away from that faced by someone who was diagnosed when the virus was first discovered 30 years ago. However people's understanding hasn't kept pace with medical advances.’ She added: ‘Misunderstanding and fear about HIV is not only damaging to those living with the virus but makes people reluctant to get tested. ‘In the UK currently one in five people who have HIV don't know they have it. ‘This can have devastating consequences for their health as well as increasing the risk of them passing HIV on to their partner. ‘In the absence of public awareness campaigns or compulsory sex education it is up to individuals to educate themselves and those around them about HIV.’","20% of people think those with the virus can only expect to live for 10 years .

"By . Darren Boyle . More land in Surrey is dedicated to playing golf rather than housing, new research has shown. Prof Paul Cheshire, researcher at the Spatial Economics Research Centre at the LSE said green belts were driving up the price of houses and subsidising activities such as golf . Prof Cheshire said in London alone there was enough green belt land to build an estimated 1.6 million new homes with average densities. He said the land bank was about 32,500 hectares and could have an impact on the cost of homes in the region. According to new research by the London School of Economics, more of Surrey is covered by golf courses, such as Camberley Heath, pictured, than housing . Prof Paul Cheshire of the London School of Economics, pictured, describes green belts as 'a very British form of discriminatory zoning' According to Prof Cheshire, 2.65 percent of Surrey is covered by golf courses which is greater than the area covered by housing . He said green belts cover one and a half times the area of Britain than covered by towns and cities. According to Prof Cheshire's research, between 1969 and 1989, in excess of 4.3 million homes were built in England, compared to 2.7 million between 1994 and 2012. He said there is currently demand for an additional 2.3 million new homes. Speaking to The Observer, Prof Cheshire said: 'We have a longstanding and endemic crisis of housing supply and it is caused primarily by policies that intentionally constrain the supply of housing land. 'Green belts are a handsome subsidy to ""horseculture"" and gold. Since our planning system prevents housing competing, land for golf courses stays very cheap. More of Surrey is now under golf courses - about 2.56 percent - than has houses on it. 'What green belts really seem to be is a very British form of discriminatory zoning, keeping the urban unwashed out of the home counties - and, of course, helping to turn houses into investment assets instead of places to live.' According to Prof Cheshire's research many of the new homes being built in England are not in the areas where there is the most demand - such as London and the south east. He said continued Government policies have seen houses turned from places to live into valuable assets. According to new research by the London School of Economics, more of Surrey is covered by golf courses, such as Foxhills Golf Club, pictured, than housing .","Green belt policy is driving up the price of houses in the South East .

'She was a mum before anything else': Lisa Watling and her husband Andy Greaves on a night out together. Ms Watling died of septicaemia after refusing to go to hospital because she didn't want to leave her children . Six sons and a daughter: Paisleigh, Jaidon, Ainsley, Lewis, Mason, Kieran and Amelia at the family home in Hull . 'She was a mum before anything else,' said Mr Greaves. 'I see her in every one of our children. It breaks my heart, not just that she is going to miss out on so much of them but how they are going to miss out on her, too.' Ms Watling, from Hull, Yorkshire, had been ill with cellulitis for only five weeks before she slipped away. She had been prescribed antibiotics for the infection, but did not take the drugs properly. As the infection took hold, Mr Greaves begged his wife to go to the hospital but, because she hated being away from the children for too long, she refused to be admitted. Eventually, she became so ill, she started became delirious and her mother called an ambulance. Paramedics rushed her to Hull Royal Infirmary, where doctors told the family there was a strong chance Ms Watling could lose her leg. Medics put her in an induced coma and she was wheeled to theatre for the amputation, but by then the poison had already spread too far and her vital organs began to fail. With no way to save her, doctors took her off the dialysis machine which was keeping her alive and she passed away with her husband and her parents by her side.

Doctors tried to save her life by amputating her leg, but the poison had already spread too far and her organs failed . Mr Greaves, who was married to Ms Watling for 11 years, said: 'I was looking at her in that hospital bed, trying to take in every bit of her I could. 'When they told us she wasn’t going to make it, she seemed to get a bit better, just enough for us to cling on to a little bit of hope and I could see us coming home together. 'Now, every time I close my eyes, I see her in the hospital bed. It didn’t seem like her.' Mr Hilton, 58, said: 'All she wanted was to be at home with the children. All she thought about was them. Now they are her legacy and our strength.' Mrs Hilton, 49, added: 'When they turned the machine off, I couldn’t watch my firstborn die. 'Lisa was a fantastic person and mother.

'She was my firstborn and my best friend': Mother Lisa Hilton, front, with Ms Watling, left, and sisters Becki Watling, rear, and Danielle Hilton, right. Mrs Hilton said that her daughter was 'born to be a mum' Ms Watling was well known and loved by many friends in the Hessle Road area of Hull whom she had known growing up and through playing darts at the Halfway House pub. 'She could make friends in an empty room,' said Mr Greaves. 'We couldn’t walk ten paces down the road without being stopped by someone for a chat. 'There were no airs and graces with her. She knew everyone and everybody loved her. 'It was her big heart that went in the end. She gave us all her love.' 'I cannot describe how I feel without her.

They couldn’t help but fall in love with her. 'I cannot describe how I feel without her. I am broken.' Mrs Hilton said it was heartbreaking that her daughter, who was 'born to be a mum' would never be able to see her seven children grow up. 'She was my firstborn and my best friend,' she said.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . CCTV: Nile Ranger has allegedly been caught on CTTV attacking a woman. He is pictured outside court last year, where he was cleared of a rape charge . Former Premiership footballer Nile Ranger is to be questioned by police after he was allegedly caught on camera slapping and punching a woman outside his block of flats. CCTV footage has emerged purportedly showing the former Newcastle striker, 23 - who now plays for Swindon Town - breaking into his own apartment block two weeks ago. The video shows a figure - believed to be Ranger - striking an unknown young woman who appears to confront him while he struggles to access the building in Swindon, Wiltshire. He slaps the woman twice with his right hand, then punches her with his left, knocking her against the wall. The man is then launches a running kick at the door to the apartment block, which allows him to break through, footage acquired by the Sunday Mirror shows. Wiltshire Police have now said they are seeking the 23-year-old player in connection with assault and also criminal damage to the door, glass paneling and the wall it was attached to, said to amount to around Â£2,000. The incident is thought to have taken place on April 13 at around 4am. An unnamed source speculated that Ranger may have forgotten a key fob which would have let him through the door. The incident came weeks after the footballer was cleared of a rape charge at Newcastle Crown Court. Ranger was acquitted by a jury of raping a woman in a hotel room after a night out. Wilteshire Police confirmed that a 23-year-old man would be 'contacted via his solicitor for interview by appointment'. A spokesman said: 'Police were contacted on April 23 by a building management company to report criminal damage at a residential address in Gordon Gardens, Swindon'. 'The company were visiting to assess damage reported by residents to have happened on April 13 at approximately 4am. Questions: Wiltshire Police have said they want to speak to Ranger in light of the footage . CCTV footage: Nile Ranger is sought by police in connection with an assault on a woman in Swindon . 'Damage caused is in the region of Â£2,000 of a lift door, a wall and a glass panel which was smashed. 'During the course of enquiries the company have supplied the police with a copy of CCTV of the incident which shows a man kicking and smashing the door and lift, and at one point punching a female who was with him. 'Police have been making enquiries to locate the suspect. 'As a result a man, aged 23, from Gordon Gardens in Swindon will be contacted via his solicitor for interview by appointment in connection with the criminal damage and assault. 'Police are keen to hear from the woman who was with the man on April 13 at 4am and would encourage her to come forward and speak to police.' A spokesman for Swindon Town FC said: 'Swindon Town Football Club has been made aware of newspaper reports relating to Nile Ranger. 'The club would like to strenuously point out that it deplores acts of violence of any kind and are absolutely appalled at this incident. 'The chairman is flying into the country for a meeting with the manager tomorrow morning to investigate further and will be making a statement following the talks.'","CCTV footage allegedly shows ranger slapping and punching a woman .

She'd had an MRI scan only three days . before, to investigate her back pain - this showed she had a severe . prolapse, a slipped disc pressing on a nerve. Though . he hadn't seen the scan, Claire's GP was convinced she was now . suffering from cauda equina syndrome and sent her to A&E with a note . saying so. The cauda equina, . literally 'horse's tail', is the bundle of nerves at the base of the . spine. They control feeling and movement in the feet, lower legs and . 'saddle' area - the bottom, genitals, rectum, and bladder. Cauda . equina syndrome is where these nerves become compressed - due to a . slipped disc, a tumour or  an injury. The result is a . contradictory-sounding combination of pain and numbness. Surgery . is the only treatment. If done early enough, this can prevent the . syndrome from becoming permanent. But in the worst cases, patients are . unable to walk and rely on a wheelchair. Many . face a lifetime of incontinence and sexual dysfunction. While the . condition is thought to affect 'just' a few hundred people in the UK . each year, the consequences are devastating. With . her GP's referral, Claire should have been passed to a specialist . spinal unit when she got to hospital. But the scan results were never . passed on; instead she was discharged with a diagnosis of 'spinal . stenosis', a narrowing of the spinal canal. She . says: 'I argued with the junior doctor. I said: ""I can't feel my bowels . or my coccyx. There's something desperately wrong."" ' By now, the clock was ticking. Cauda equina syndrome is where nerves at base of spine become compressed . As . John Reynard, a urology specialist at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, . explains, the chances of a complete recovery are highest if the patient . has surgery within 24 hours. 'If a nerve is being pressed on, its blood . supply is being impaired and it will eventually die. The sooner you . decompress that, the sooner you ensure it remains viable.' In . the evening, Claire went back to the hospital and was admitted. Cauda . equina syndrome was diagnosed, and she was rushed to a larger hospital. But there were no orthopaedic surgeons free when she arrived, and there was disagreement about the urgency of her case. Claire . was scheduled for an operation first thing the next day, but was . shunted down the list. It was lunchtime before she went into surgery, at . least 36 hours after the pain first hit. 'The . surgery was successful in that I'm not completely paralysed,' says . Claire. But because she was sent home without a catheter, she suffered a . bladder and uterus prolapse. Four . years on, Claire has been left with partial paralysis of the legs. The . pain is always there. She is doubly incontinent and unable to work. Proportion of back pain patients who have no clear cause of their condition . But the worst thing, she says, is the loss of sexual function, which ruined her marriage. She and her husband have now divorced. The NHS trust that treated Claire has admitted liability for failing to pass on her scan and is negotiating compensation. But . she wants to make sure others don't suffer in the same way, and has set . up the Cauda Equina Syndrome Association to campaign for more awareness . of the symptoms and better care. Eddie . Jones, head of medical negligence at JMW, the Manchester firm . representing Claire, says: 'There seems to be a significant lack of . education across different specialities. I think we've had . physiotherapists, GPs, paramedics, junior doctors in A&E, . orthopaedic surgeons, even neurosurgeons missing the signs.' This . has cost the NHS dearly. The NHS Litigation Authority has paid out . £377 million since 1995 for 159 cases involving cauda equina syndrome. A . further 180 cases are still being brought. The . Society of British Neurological Surgeons denies there's a widespread . lack of understanding. Spokesman Rodney Laing, a consultant neurosurgeon . at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, says: 'It's always helpful to . repeat messages, especially to non-specialists, but I don't think there . is a mass of ignorance about this.' He . points instead to the early symptoms being difficult to differentiate . from the acute back pain that brings thousands of people to A&E each . year. 'The problem is that . many patients present in the phase before they have the complete . syndrome.' Mr Laing adds that sending all the patients with back pain . and urinary changes for MRI scans would consume huge amounts of NHS . resources. Claire Thornber is . not convinced, and John Reynard agrees. 'I've been involved with 100 . cases now and I get the impression that some doctors don't recognise the . subtle signs that indicate nerve compression,' he says. It's . not just the physical effects that are so devastating. Callers to . Claire's helpline say the NHS has been slow to recognise the . psychological shock. 'Men find it very difficult to deal with the fact . it makes them impotent. I spoke to one man of 29 . . .' she trails off. 'It's a massive, life-changing thing. Some people never get over it.' cesassociation.org.uk .","Back condition left Claire Thornber, 42, disabled and without a sex life ."
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The Birds Eye study reveals that one in ten people in Britain eat their dinner in the office (file picture) Brits fall into four categories when it comes to mealtimes, a nationwide survey spanning the last 20 years has revealed. Looking at the way real people eat these days The Big Mealtime Audit by Birds Eye found we're either Rep-eat-ers, Social-eats, Free Rangers or All Day Grazers. Traditional Rep-eat-ers stick to a square three meals a day and hate throwing food away, while Social-eats are foodies who regularly eat out and host dinner parties at least twice a week. Food-loving All Day Grazers are snackers who fit their meals in around their jobs sometimes scoffing up to 11 times a day. Over a third (34 per cent) have brinner - breakfast for dinner - and 42 per cent enjoy a late night snack. And busy Brits make up the 20 per cent of us who are Free Rangers- time-poor Brits who have to grab food wherever they can on the go. According to the findings over a quarter of Brits (26 per cent) now eat their breakfast on their commute while one in ten (ten per cent) eat their dinner in the office or in the car. In addition, 85 per cent said they regularly snack to get them through the day. At home, Brits spend on average just 25 minutes around the dinner table. The most common dinner table topic is family (32 per cent) while almost one in seven (15 per cent) use their meal to talk football. To better understand how Brit's consumption habits have changed over the years Birds Eye has appointed one of the world's most respected photographers to undertake a documentary of how we eat today called the 'Food of Life' campaign. Martin Parr, who has famously captured the personal tastes and habits of Britons for more than 22 years, will be spend the next four months producing a unique snapshot of British mealtimes. As well as travelling the country and finding subjects to take part in the project, three members of the public will win the chance to be photographed by submitting pictures of their mealtime moments to birdseyeview.birdseye.co.uk . Birds Eye Marketing Director Margaret Jobling said: 'Mealtimes are still clearly the glue that holds families and friends together, even though the nation's eating and consumption habits have changed and we might not be sitting down for the traditional three square meals a day. 'The research, combined with the Martin Parr study will help us to understand and celebrate this as we're passionate about creating food that can be enjoyed every day by everyone.' The results will be exhibited in London from September.","Birds Eye study has been carried out across the country over last 20 years .

"By . Emma Innes . Obese people who are told obesity is a disease are less likely to try dieting, new research shows . Describing obesity as a disease makes people eat more, new research suggests. The label also encourages unhealthy behaviour among people who are severely overweight, the study revealed. The researchers believe this could be because labelling obesity as a disease makes people think it is unchangeable and that attempts at weight loss are likely to be fruitless. Researchers at the University of Richmond and the University of Minnesota say obese people who are told their condition is a disease place less importance on dieting and are less concerned about their weight. As a result, they also tend to eat more unhealthily. The American Medical Association defined obesity as a disease in June 2013 and psychologists Crystal Hoyt and Jeni Burnette wanted to establish what effect this has had. ‘Considering that obesity is a crucial public health issue, a more nuanced understanding of the impact of an “obesity is a disease” message has significant implications for patient-level and policy-level outcomes,’ said Dr Hoyt. ‘Experts have been debating the merits of, and problems with, the AMA policy — we wanted to contribute to the conversation by bringing data rather than speculation and by focusing on the psychological repercussions.’ Dr Hoyt and her colleagues recruited more than 700 participants to take part in an online survey across three different studies. The participants read an article related to health and weight and then answered various questions. Importantly, some participants read an article that described obesity as a disease, some read a standard public health message about weight, and others read an article specifically stating that obesity is not a disease. Height and weight data were used to calculate the participants’ body mass index and to classify participants as ‘average weight’ or ‘obese’, in line with World Health Organisation guidelines. The results showed that the particular message obese participants read had a clear impact on their attitudes toward health, diet, and weight. Being told obesity is a disease can make people think their situation is unchangeable . Specifically, obese participants who read the ‘obesity is a disease’ article placed less importance on dieting and reported less concern about weight relative to obese participants who read the other two articles. They also chose higher-calorie options when asked to pick a sandwich from a menu. Interestingly, these participants reported greater body satisfaction, which, in turn, also predicted higher-calorie food choices. ‘Together, these findings suggest that the messages individuals hear about the nature of obesity have self-regulatory consequences,’ said Dr Hoyt. Despite these findings, the researchers also accept that labelling obesity as a disease can have benefits. They say it can reduce stigma which might help obese people engage with, and attempt to tackle, the problem.","In June 2013 American Medical Association defined obesity as a disease .

"By . Andrew Williams . Back pain: The Overtones' singer Mike Crawshaw, 34, was diagnosed with a degenerate disc in his spine in 2008 . Having sold half a million copies of his album Saturday Night At The Movies and completed a  sell-out UK tour, one might forgive singer Mike Crawshaw for putting his feet up. But he is more likely to be found hitting the gym. For Mike, though, the reason for his devotion to fitness is more than vanity. Exercise is his way of coping with degenerative disc disease in his lower back, and the almost constant pain that has blighted his life for six years. Despite his doctors recommending . surgery, Mike – one fifth of vocal harmony group The Overtones – has . decided against having the operation because he’s terrified it might . leave him worse off. Instead, . to keep himself motivated, he is writing a fitness blog and hopes to . inspire others in the same situation to get in shape. Mike, . 34, noticed a problem in 2008, ironically while exercising. ‘I felt a . pop in the small of my back, then a grinding ache. I thought, “I’ve done . something,” ’ he says. ‘Over the next few days I was getting shooting pains down the backs of my legs.’ He . went to his GP, who sent him  to a physiotherapist. ‘The stretching . exercises helped but they didn’t fix the problem,’ he recalls. He . was then sent for an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, where it . was discovered he was suffering from a degenerate disc in his spine. Orthopaedic . expert Dr John Outhwaite says most people over the  age of 30 will have . this kind of problem with their discs – the tough, fluid-filled sacs . that act as cushions, allowing the vertebral bones in the spine to move . smoothly. Disc degeneration follows a pattern. First, the gel centre loses water, becoming thick and fibrous. As a result, it loses its shock-absorbing properties. Routine stress and strain begin to take a toll on the structures of the spine, and tears form in the outer membrane. As the disc weakens, it starts to collapse, and the bones of the spine compress. Dr Outhwaite, of the London Orthopaedic Clinic, says: ‘If the disc ruptures, the fluid can escape and press on to surrounding nerves, causing weakness in the muscles which the nerve runs to. Pain typically radiates from the deep muscles in the back and down the legs, where the nerves run.’ Why some people develop degenerate discs is not known but genetics are thought to play a key role. Boyband: Mike, pictured centre with fellow Overtones bandmembers Lachie Chapman Darren Everest, Mark Franks and Timmy Matley, now blogs about his fitness regime to help with the disc problem . ‘If the fibrous part of the joint is being worked and twisted all the time, it can’t repair itself fast enough and will burst,’ says Dr Outhwaite. ‘It can come on suddenly when exercising, but I’ve also met people  it happened to who just rolled over in bed.’ In 2010, Mike was offered a discectomy to trim the disc, which would ease the pressure on his nerve. However, The Overtones had just signed their record deal. ‘I was told there was a one per cent risk of being left unable to walk properly,’ he says. ‘I don’t know if this was a sign but the day after I saw the doctor, I saw a man limping. A few weeks later I met a DJ while doing  a radio interview who had the operation and who had been left with a problem with his feet. I decided against it.’ Instead, Mike has turned to exercise to strengthen the muscles around the affected area, writing a blog about his experiences called My Reluctant Fitness. ‘I focus on exercises to strengthen my core,’  he says. ‘I’ve had great feedback and it’s good to know I’m not the only one with back problems.’ But the pain can get him down. ‘It’s a constant thing and it can affect my mood,’ Mike admits. Sitting in one position isn’t helpful but the hours of rehearsal needed to prepare for a show also take their toll. ‘We’ll rehearse for eight hours a day and I need regular breaks.’ Dr Outhwaite says that even if Mike chooses to have the surgery,  it might not be the solution as up  to one in eight patients will experience a recurrence of pain after the operation. ‘Drop foot’ – the complication Mike fears that leaves patients limping – occurs in one per cent of cases. ‘Every time a surgeon operates on your spine, there’s a chance something can go wrong,’ says Dr Outhwaite. He advises patients to first pursue other options such as physiotherapy, exercise and medication for pain control – and even epidural injections that can decrease the inflammation around the disc. ‘The right kind of exercise can be helpful,’ he says. ‘You can strengthen the back muscles that support everything. This helps deal with the spasms in the affected muscles that cause pain. It’s possible to help with these problems without surgery.’","Mike Crawshaw, 34, was diagnosed with a degenerate disc in 2008 .

"By . Emma Innes . A child survived her heart stopping four times in 45 minutes after she suffered a rare reaction to a sore throat - and blew-up ‘like Violet from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory’. Five-year-old Ava Mear ‘swelled like a blueberry’ and was diagnosed with a rare reaction to the sore throat bacteria Strep A. The reaction caused her heart to fail three times in quick succession as the infection took hold of her body. Ava Mear suffered four heart attacks after having a severe reaction to the sore throat bacterium . Medics warned her parents to say their last goodbyes because they feared she would not survive another resuscitation. But miraculously she survived a her heart stopping for a fourth time in 45 minutes after doctors hooked her up to an artificial lung and heart machine. The machine oxygenated her blood and pumped it round her frail body, bypassing the heart, while dialysis cleansed her blood of toxins. Ava developed a rash which spread across her body turning her purple and fluids being pumped through her body to clear her of infection made her balloon in size. Amazingly, Ava pulled through and the rash turned from purple to red before fading completely. Delighted parents Clive and Mary-Jane Mear, who also have a ten-year-old-son called Alfie, say after ten weeks in hospital she is now recovering well. Ava was rushed to hospital after her parents noticed she was breathing heavily and had developed a rash . She was transferred to Great Ormond Street and within an hour of arriving she had her first heart attack . Mr Mear, 44, said: ‘She was breathing heavily so we took her to the local hospital at about 11pm. We’re so glad we did that. ‘She was rushed straight to Great Ormond Street Hospital and within an hour of her being there had her first heart attack. ‘After her third heart attack a surgeon told us about a risky procedure they could try. ‘I just cut him off. I said “do it, do it now - I’ll sign whatever forms I need to later”. ‘If she had been at any other hospital which hadn’t had the ability to bypass her heart she wouldn’t be here now. My wife was like mush in my arms. ‘All that was going through our heads was how we were going to tell Alfie that one day he had a perfectly healthy sister and the next day she’d gone to hospital and died. Ava had four heart attacks within 45 minutes and doctors told her parents to say goodbye . Ava (pictured recovering in hospital) was saved by medics who put her on an artificial heart and lung machine . ‘You are numb, it is like you are on rails on a journey, you are in a process and you have to keep going. ‘When people say to me I don’t know how you coped - I say ‘you just do because you have to’. ‘She looked like Violet from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, bless her. She was purple from head to toe. She’s our little miracle.’ Ava suddenly fell ill and on January 27 was repeatedly getting up in the night. Mr and Mrs Mear rushed her to Luton and Dunstable Hospital, Bedfordshire, after they realised she was heavily breathing and noticed a small rash. Doctors knew the rash was a bad sign and transferred her to Great Ormond Street Hospital overnight. Ava has been in hospital for three months but has moved from Great Ormond Street to her local hospital . There she was diagnosed with a toxic shock reaction to Strep A - a common bacterium which normally causes sore throats. The infection caused Ava’s body to shut down and she has been left with movement problems after he limbs were affected by a lack of circulation. Ava also suffers from a condition called cerebro-costo-mandibular Syndrome. It is a genetic condition which affects the ribs structure, meaning Ava has no ribs on the front of her body and her ribs aren’t attached to her spine. She was also born with a large cleft palate, which has since been fixed and has a recessed bottom jaw. Although the condition is unrelated to the infection, it meant Great Ormond Street doctors knew Ava’s medical history inside out and were able to efficiently treat her. Ava (pictured in hospital) is slowly recovering but it is not yet clear if she will make a full recovery . Ava underwent a tracheotomy and has this week been moved back to Luton and Dunstable Hospital for physiotherapy and rehabilitation. Mr Mear, a photographer, sad: ‘We really don’t know the prognosis, it depends on how she reacts to physio but we have a child, we have Ava - it doesn’t matter what’s wrong with her, at least she’s here.’ A Great Ormond Street spokesman said: ‘Ava is the only Group A streptococcal case who has gone on to develop toxic shock requiring ECMO at the hospital in the last two years.’ Strep A bacteria is often found on the skin and throat and minor infections are common in adults and children. It only poses a potentially serious threat to health if it penetrates deeper inside the tissues or organs. Ava was born with a cleft palate and a recessed jaw as well as rib abnormalities . The family, from Caddington, Bedfordshire, are now trying to raise £80,000 to buy two moreECMO machines for the hospital. A group of parents will be running 50km from Caddington village green to the doors of Great Ormond Street on Sunday, May 18. ECMO machines, which are used to treat a number of conditions, are similar to the heart-lung bypass machine used for open heart surgery. The technology was first used successfully in the USA in 1976 and introduced into the UK in 1989. Great Ormond Street Hospital is one of three centres in England and Wales with an ECMO machine.To donate visit www.justgiving.com/avas-ecmo-challenge .","Ava Mear was rushed to hospital when she started breathing heavily .

"By . Emma Innes . A ‘sprightly’ 94-year-old admitted to hospital with a minor injury died from a brain haemorrhage after a series of catastrophic errors by experienced staff, an inquest heard. Former civil servant Violet Wood suffered a fatal head injury at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich, south east London, while receiving treatment for a minor fall and infection. Despite staff being aware of her potentially life-threatening condition, they failed to notice that her health was deteriorating dangerously until it was too late, the inquest heard. Violet Wood, 94, died of a brain haemorrhage after falling and hitting her head in a hospital ward . The much-loved widow had been left alone in a room off a busy ward and had been allowed to sleep - a warning sign that she needed urgent medical attention for a cranial fracture, the hearing was told. Her family said they have been left ‘gutted’ by the mistakes that led to her death. Mrs Wood had spent two days on the hospital’s Acute Medical Unit (AMU) where she was being treated for dehydration and an infection in early 2012. She had come to the hospital previously after falling at home, and was classed as a ‘medium’ fall risk by hospital procedures, the inquest heard. Under the guidelines nurses need to be aware of where patients such as Mrs Wood are at all times, explain the risk to them and contact their relatives. In the early morning of January 29, Mrs Wood, who had no history of dementia according to her GP, fell while walking around the ward and hit her head just after 3am. Mrs Wood (pictured with her friend, George) was admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woolwich, with a minor injury after falling at home but she never left the hospital . Earlier that day she had been adamant that she return home to her sheltered flat in Blackheath, south east London, telling staff: ‘I can’t stay here all day, I need to get things done.’ She was sent for a CT scan of her head and staff were expected to carry out regular ‘neurological observations’ as a precaution until a doctor was satisfied that brain scans showed she was OK. However, nurses did not follow handover procedures and paperwork correctly, and the careful attention she required was missed. Horribly bruised, Mrs Wood was eventually given a bed in a room off the ward, where she was left to fall asleep. Nurse Olufunmilayo Afolabi-Shittu, who was caring for Mrs Wood, said she failed to raise the alarm until she ‘vomited big’. The nurse said: ‘The situation then was, because I did not want to disturb her at that time. I wasn’t worried much about her condition.’ She had been tasked with checking her condition hourly but instead left her to sleep until checking on her at 16.30 that afternoon, the inquest heard. When Mrs Wood hit her head, nurses failed to check on her so did not notice her condition was deteriorating . She said: ‘By the time I went back there initially she was coughing and threw up big, then I was really worried.’ Mrs Wood died the next day, with a post-mortem examination showing the cause of death as pneumonia and a haemorrhage from a fractured skull. Nurses responsible for looking after Mrs Wood at the time admitted at an inquest at Southwark Coroner’s Court that there had been mistakes, but blamed the tragic lapse on a lack of available staff to take care of a number of ‘confused’ elderly patients wandering around the unit. They claimed that rules about restraining patients meant that the accident would have been difficult to prevent and other measures would have been a greater risk. During questioning by Assistant Coroner for Southwark, Sarah Ormond-Walshe, the team responsible for Mrs Wood’s care said they had learned from her death. Senior Charge Nurse Greg Mirabona, who was in charge of the ward on the morning of January 29, said he ‘wouldn’t do the same again’. By the time nurses realised how ill Mrs Wood was, it was too late to save her and she died the next day . When asked about the problem with staffing, he said: ‘I can say it’s much better now. ‘It has been increased now from what we originally did.’ He added that more staff were booked as a precaution. However, Inge Vermeullen, a physiotherapist who had treated Mrs Wood, said there was ‘no way’ of avoiding cases like hers, adding: ‘Everything that we could have had in place was in place at that time.’ Speaking outside the hearing Violet’s niece, Karen Hills, 50, who is herself a bowel cancer nurse at the Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent, described her disbelief at the errors. She said: ‘I just feel gutted as despite being profoundly deaf she still had an active social life with her friends and family. ‘I thought that whoever had been looking after her was junior and not very experienced. ‘However, they were both clearly experienced nurses who had been on the ward some time. To find out that they hadn’t grasped the severity or the potential severity of the decisions they have made, it’s horrible. ‘As a nurse myself it is drilled into us that you check on your patients, you follow the procedures, it’s your pin badge on the line or you end up somewhere like this.’ The hearing continues.","Violet Wood went to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woolwich, with minor injury .

"By . Jill Foster . Emma-Victoria Houlton loves her food; whether it's a Sunday roast with all the trimmings or an Italian meal, she's always happy to tuck in. But just five years ago, Emma, 29, would have baulked at eating pasta, bread, pizza dough, potatoes and Yorkshire puddings. Why? Because, like thousands of others, she believed high-protein, low-carb regimes like the Atkins or Paleo diets were the most effective way to be slim. Diet damage: Emma-Victoria Houlton, left, broke a bone in her foot due to calcium deficiency while Brooke Power, right, suffered migraines and dizziness during ten months on a low carb diet . But, after cutting down on carbs so much that she wouldn't even eat dairy products as they contain lactose - a sugar - Emma-Victoria believes she has permanently damaged her health. 'I was only a size eight but found it hard to stay slim,' she says. 'Then, when I was 22, I saw a documentary about the Atkins diet, thought it was great and cut most carbs out of my diet. 'Breakfast was an omelette, lunch was chicken with lettuce and dinner was something meaty with vegetables like kale, cabbage, sprouts or runner beans, which don’t contain starch. 'I got all the classic symptoms associated with a low-carb diet: dry mouth, tiredness, crankiness and bad breath. But I saw great results - my 8st 7lb weight was much easier to maintain.' Unbelievably, Emma-Victoria, a creative director in Manchester, stuck to the regime for three punishing years. Unbalanced: All protein and no carbs can upset the digestive system and cause muscle to be burnt for energy . 'At restaurants, every meal had to be steak and salad,' she says. 'I'd go to a friend's house for dinner and if they'd made pasta, I'd eat a tiny amount, so as not to be rude, and end up feeling really ill - with chronic bloating and having to dash to the toilet. 'I decided to come off the diet, and started eating normally, but the bloating became so bad I went to my GP. When he asked about my diet and I told him what I'd been doing, he pretty much rolled his eyes and said that in simple terms, my body had stopped producing the enzymes I needed to process carbohydrates. 'He said I'd have to reintroduce around one or two grams a week very slowly, and gave me peppermint oil capsules to relieve the symptoms. For weeks I had stomach aches, bloating and kept going to the toilet. It was embarrassing and painful.' She adds: 'Although I’m better now, I have been diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome. It only started during the low-carb regime. It's effectively wrecked my health.' Dr Sarah Brewer, author of Nutrition: A Beginners Guide, believes drastic no-carb diets like Emma's can damage digestion. I loved the results, but I was crying all the time because I was so hungry . 'Bacteria in the bowel react very quickly to changes in the diet and the gut only has one way of complaining - through poor digestion,' she says. 'It should recover but can take a while. 'It's the quality of carbs you should focus on, not the quantity. Cutting out processed foods, such as white bread, cake and pastries is good for reducing the risk of diabetes, but carbohydrates shouldn't be cut out all together. 'A healthy diet should consist of low-glycemic index carbs from foods such as healthy grains, fruit and lots of vegetables.' Emma believes her diet had another damaging consequence. Soon after she came off it, she broke a bone in her foot while out running and believes being deficient in calcium for months may have left her bones vulnerable. No fun: No carb dieters can feel low on energy and constantly hungry . 'The doctors suggested that the fact I hadn't been drinking milk for over two years may have weakened my bones,' she says. While low-carb diets have waned in popularity since a peak in the early 2000s, many still embark on them. Research shows nearly 50 per cent of women sometimes feel guilty about eating carbohydrates and one in ten always does. Such is the pressure to keep thin, many are willing to risk their health by cutting them out. Mum-of-three Brooke Power, 27, suffered migraines and dizziness during ten months on such a diet. She wanted to shed weight after the birth of her second daughter Zoe. Although she lost over three stone, she gave up when she realised it had affected her fertility. 'The only carbs I'd eat all day were the 50g of porridge made with water for breakfast,' says Brooke, who lives in Bolton, Lancashire, with her mechanic husband Jonathan, 26. 'After that, it would be chicken salad, protein shakes or egg whites. 'I was losing two pounds a week: I had been 11st 3lb, too much for my 5ft 4in height. I loved the results, but I was crying all the time because I was so hungry - but the more I did it, the more obsessed I was about leaving carbs out of my diet. The headaches and exhaustion were terrible. I’d feel dizzy and almost passed out several times. My hair became thinner. My periods stopped then became erratic. I put it down to the diet.' 'I nearly passed out. I felt sick and . couldn't function properly. Around day three I developed a headache so . bad I thought it was a migraine and my skin and scalp became dry and . itchy' Brooke's rapid weight loss on the no-carb diet was to blame, says Dr Sarah Brewer. 'If you lose 5-10 per cent of your body weight very quickly - as she did - the body reacts by shutting down ovulation because it knows it won't be able to cope in a pregnancy. As soon as you start eating a well-balanced diet again, and regain weight, ovulation should begin again.' Brooke adds: 'Jonathan and I both wanted another baby and had started trying six months after we'd had Zoe, but it just wasn't happening. When I reintroduced carbs, we conceived Riley almost straight away.' Despite having learned a hard lesson, she still sees carbohydrates as something of an enemy. 'Even now I feel a bit guilty when I overdo it on carbs,' she says. Sioned Quirke, of the British Dietetic Association, says she often sees women in her clinical practice consumed with guilt. 'They think they've ruined their diet because they've eaten a slice of bread or a potato but the reality is we need carbohydrates in our diet for energy and fibre to help our bowel function, as well as vitamin  B. If you're lacking vitamin B12, found in many fortified cereals, you can develop anaemia as it helps form red blood cells. 'Cutting out one food group is a sure way to become ill. Every cell needs glucose, so if you suddenly become depleted in it, you'll begin to suffer lethargy, headaches, cramps, irritability, depression. Problem: Emma developed IBS as a result of her diet (posed by model) 'You might have constipation, because of the lack of fibre. The bowel often doesn't recover from a drastic change of diet. 'If you continue the regime for many months, the body starts to take its energy from protein stores in the muscles. So your muscles - including your heart - will be wasting away. Your skin, hair and nails will become thin, dry and flaky. 'I don't think you'd survive for longer than about five years on an extremely low-carb diet. Gillian O'Toole 32, who runs her own jewellery business in Liverpool, says she still feels guilty when carbs pass her lips, although ditching them has played havoc with her health. She took up the Paleo, or caveman, diet - based on the food supposedly eaten by Paleolithic humans. 'Within three days of starting the Paleo diet - lots of meat, no sugar, carbs, caffeine or dairy - I'd lost half a stone but was so ill it felt like my body was in shock. 'I nearly passed out. I felt sick and couldn't function properly. Around day three I developed a headache so bad I thought it was a migraine and my skin and scalp became dry and itchy. 'I started reintroducing things like sweet potato but two weeks later noticed lumps in my armpit and was absolutely petrified it could be cancer. 'My GP he reassured me it wasn't cancer, but tiny boils, and it was down to my unbalanced diet. I started eating carbs again and soon the lumps had gone.' Dr Sarah Brewer says boils could result from an immune system weakened by rapid weight loss. 'In those without diabetes, boils are usually associated with low immunity that promotes infection of hair follicles,' she says, and recommends vitamin supplements to dieters. Gillian says her diet is back to normal now. 'Even though the experience really scared me, I still feel guilty eating carbs. It's ridiculous women are prepared to risk their health just to be slim but we're all as bad as each other.'","Emma-Victoria Houlton, 29, now has Irritable Bowel Syndrome .

"By . Emma Innes . Using the internet can help elderly people combat depression, according to a new report. It's estimated that as many as 10 million older Americans suffer from depression, often brought on by feelings of loneliness and isolation. But the latest research - a project that followed the lives of thousands of retired Americans for six years - found that internet use among the elderly can reduce the chance of becoming depressed by more than 30 per cent. Using the internet can help elderly people avoid depression, new research suggests . ‘That's a very strong effect,’ said Shelia Cotten, a Michigan State University professor of telecommunication, information studies and media who led the project. ‘And it all has to do with older persons being able to communicate, to stay in contact with their social networks, and just not feel lonely.’ Professor Cotten and her colleagues analysed the data collected by the Health and Retirement Survey, which collected information from more than 22,000 older Americans every two years. This particular sample included more than 3,000 respondents. ‘This is one of the largest and most comprehensive surveys of its kind,’ Professor Cotten said. Other smaller studies have been inconclusive about the role internet use, and technology in general, play in helping people overcome depression. One way in which this study was different is it took into consideration the participants’ depression levels before they began using the internet. The researchers wanted to know if past depression affected current depression. What they found is yes, some people did remain depressed despite internet use, although it wasn't substantial. Using the internet can help elderly people stay in touch with friends and family meaning they feel less lonely . ‘Internet use continues to reduce depression, even when controlling for that prior depressive state,’ Professor Cotten said. The researchers also confirmed what was found in other studies: That for older people who live alone, internet use had a greater impact on their levels of depression. ‘This study makes significant contributions to the study of internet use and depression in the older, retired population,’ Professor Cotten said. She said it all comes down to how you choose to use your technology. As with most things in life, moderation is best. ‘If you sit in front of a computer all day, ignoring the roles you have in life and the things you need to accomplish as part of your daily life, then it's going to have a negative impact on you,’ Professor Cotten said. ‘But if you're using it in moderation and you're doing things that enhance your life, then the impacts are likely to be positive in terms of health and well-being.’ This research is published in the Journal of Gerontology: Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences.","The study followed thousands of retired Americans for six years .

"By . Katy Winter . A self-confessed former couch potato has lost seven stone in under a year and says it’s changed her life. Claire Griffiths, 35, says she’s always been overweight, but her ever-increasing size meant she she avoided the scales out of fear. It wasn’t until the mother-of-two went along to a weight-loss club meeting with her friend for 'moral support' that she actually found out what she weighed -  which was 19st 2lb. Claire dropped from 19st 2lb and size 26 (left) to 12st 2lb and size 12 (right) in under a year . Photos showing Claire's amazing transformation (L-R) which she achieved through ditching her unhealthy diet . 'I would never have got on the scales previously,' says Claire, a customer assistant for Tesco, who lives in Hemlington, Middlesbrough with her sons Kane, 17, and Brandon, 11, and partner Jason Fysh, 43. 'Basically a friend asked me to go with her to a slimming club. I went along really thinking it was a big con. 'I thought ""you have to pay someone to weigh you? It’s not going to work"".' Breakfast: Three slices of toast with thick butter, cup of tea and five chocolate digestives . Lunch: Two Greggs pasties . Dinner: Spaghetti bolognese made from jars or a take away. Snacks/Other: Up to two bottles of wine, chocolate bars, crisps . Breakfast: A fresh fruit salad with fat free yoghurt . Lunch: Left overs from a freshly cooked meal or salad . Dinner: Freshly cooked meal such as Mexican or homemade Indian . Snacks/Other: Fruit . Claire now runs her own slimming group and says her weigh loss has changed her life . But . despite her misgiving she was inspired to join up and within a week on . the plan, Claire - who was a size 24-26 - had lost six and a half pounds . and was inspired to keep on with the weight loss. In just under a year Claire, who went to a Coulby Newham Slimming World Group, has slimmed to 12st 2lb and a dress size 12. 'I just went on from there,” says Claire, who now runs her own group in Yarm. 'And it has changed my life dramatically. I used to get in from work and plonk myself on the settee. Now I go to Zumba, go to the gym. My confidence has soared.' Claire's aim is to eat healthily - including a lot of home-cooked meals - with the occasional treat. 'I eat loads,' says Claire, 'In fact I never stop eating. It’s just about working out the correct foods.' She added: 'I thought I was happy before but I’m actually really happy now. 'Friends and family have been shocked but really supportive and really happy for me. 'A lot of them now comment on how well I look. 'I feel healthier too - I do things like going swimming with the boys which I never used to do. 'I used to read the magazines about people who’d lost weight and think ‘that’s not the same person’. 'But it really, really does work - as long as you stick to a plan. I’m living proof.'","Dropped from 19st 2lb and size 26 to 12st 2lb and size 12 in under a year .
