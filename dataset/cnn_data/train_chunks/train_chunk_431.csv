"In 1945, not long after attending a historic meeting with Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin and mere weeks before dying, President Franklin D. Roosevelt addressed Congress. Frail from years of declining health, Roosevelt was forced to give his last report to Congress sitting down, but many of the words he spoke that day were strong: . ""The structure of world peace cannot be the work of one man, or one party, or one nation, it cannot be just an American peace, or British peace, or a Russian, or a French or a Chinese peace. It cannot be a peace of large nations--or of small nations. It must be a peace which rests on the cooperative effort of the whole world."" Over the past few months we have heard a lot of rhetoric from Republican candidates about the supposed weakness of President Obama in relation to foreign policy -- specifically his willingness to apologize when the United States has inadvertently hurt or offended another nation. It seems his challengers' idea of strength is to never admit that you are wrong, which any therapist will tell you is more of a reflection of a person's insecurity and weakness than of resolve or strength. And given the number of times the Reagan administration apologized -- to countries like Japan, China and Poland  -- you would think this bunch of Reagan wannabes would want to be more careful in describing the behavior they consider weak. Now, I understand it is an election year and certainly President Obama is as guilty as his opponents of being overtly political -- for example, holding a press conference the day of his rivals' Super Tuesday contests. But the no-apology theme that has become part of the GOP campaign fabric harms the ability of this and future presidents to lead the kind of cooperative effort Roosevelt spoke of nearly 70 years ago. It is extremely shortsighted of Rick Santorum, Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich to willfully cloud international diplomacy for some misguided cheers and a few lousy delegates. It's irresponsible and it's counterproductive, for as Roosevelt pointed out in his last days, even the strongest of nations need the cooperation of others to achieve the ultimate goal of peace. It is hard to get them to rally behind you when you behave as the world's bully. We can bribe countries with financial aid, we can scare them with military might, but all  that only buys time. It masks resentment or delays war. But it doesn't bring peace. Only humility can do that. Our light as a nation shines brightest not when we tout our greatness but when we behave selflessly. The core of our character is epitomized by our willingness to fight injustices beyond our borders. But all that is undermined when we ignore the injustices -- intentional or not -- that America commits. Acknowledging that we are not above reproach only adds to our credibility. And we are going to need all  the influence we can muster. When I look around, I see a planet at a critical juncture in history. The nuclear threat in Iran is unnerving, but it is only one of many challenges we face.  We have a looming energy crisis and global food shortage because of rapid population growth. Some of these issues we simply cannot just bully our way past. We're going to have to sit down with our friends as well as enemies. After all, no war has ever ended without both at the table. Read some of the featured comments on this article . We're also going to need to be a part of the global community in a cooperative way -- and sometimes that will mean leading.  Sometimes that will mean following. And yes, sometimes that will mean apologizing. We should have apologized for testing syphilis on unsuspecting Guatemalans in the 1960s, and I'm glad President Obama did. We should want to apologize for reneging on the promises made to the Filipino veterans who helped us fight in World War II. And I'm glad we apologized for the unintentional burning of the Qurans in Afghanistan. Who knows how much worse the situation surrounding the massacre that left 16 civilian Afghans dead would be if President Obama hadn't apologized for that earlier offense? Doing so didn't make him or the country weak, it made us strong. Weak is never having the guts to say ""I'm sorry.""

"Iran and the United States rang in the Persian new year Tuesday with distinctly different messages for the Iranian people. President Barack Obama slammed the Islamic Republic's crackdown on electronic communications and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned that Iran would not hesitate to strike back in the event of an attack on the Islamic republic. The beginning of the year 1391 took Khamenei to the massive Imam Reza shrine complex in the eastern city of Mashhad, where thousands jammed the mosque to hear the nation's supreme leader. Khamenei denied Iran has nuclear capability or that it is trying to develop atomic weapons. But he warned that Iran will defend itself if the United States or Israel attacks -- words that only increase anxiety in Iran's nuclear showdown with world powers. Sporadic chants of ""Death to America"" erupted during Khamenei's pauses in between his declarations of Iran's greatness and the West's inability to tear down the Islamic revolution's achievements. Khamenei said the main reason for the West's enmity toward Iran has to do with its desire to control Iran's vast oil reserves. ""A nation's prowess all depends on energy, on oil,"" he said. ""It's the Islamic Republic of Iran that they have a problem with because this republic has stood like a lion in their face."" Khamenei also urged Iranians to support domestic production to stave off the debilitating effects of international sanctions. He said the government must cooperate with local industries and financial institutions to boost production. He urged Iranians to buy local -- saying that Iranian-made products are just as good as foreign brands. ""You must seek Iran-made products,"" he said. ""It's in your hands, the hands of the people. When you consume, consume indigenously."" Obama, on the other hand, used the holiday, known as Nowruz, to remind the world of the Tehran regime's attempts to curb the flow of information in and out of Iran. ""Like the iron curtain of the 20th century, an electronic curtain is descending as the Iranian regime attempts to control what its citizens see and hear,' Obama said in a video new year's message posted on YouTube in English, with Farsi and Arabic subtitles. ""To the people of Iran, this holiday comes at a time of continued tension between our two countries,"" he said. ""But as people gather with their families, do good deeds, and welcome a new season, we are also reminded of the common humanity that we share. There is no reason for the United States and Iran to be divided from one another. ""Yet increasingly, the Iranian people are denied the basic freedom to access the information that they want. The Iranian government jams satellite signals to shut down television and radio broadcasts. It censors the Internet to control what the Iranian people can see and say. The regime monitors computers and cell phones for the sole purpose of protecting its own power. And in recent weeks, Internet restrictions have become so severe that Iranians cannot communicate freely with their loved ones."" As a result of ""the actions of the Iranian regime,"" Obama said, ""an electronic curtain has fallen around Iran --  a barrier that stops the free flow of information and ideas into the country, and denies the rest of the world the benefit of interacting with the Iranian people, who have so much to offer."" The Nowruz messages come at a time of heightened tensions between Iran and world powers. The United States and the European Union have targeted Iranian banks in an effort to persuade Iran to abandon any nuclear weapon ambitions. A nuclear watchdog agency report in November said Iran could potentially be developing a bomb. Israel has even hinted at pre-emptive strikes on Iranian nuclear plants to set shut down or, at least, set back Iran's program. Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recently discussed the matter at the White House. Iran has been reeling under the crush of sanctions that have severely devalued the currency and spiked prices of food and other basic commodities. Some Iranians told CNN that their Nowruz celebrations would be sharply tempered this year because of the economic situation -- they simply could not afford it. Khamenei urged unity among Iranians at this time. Disunity, he said, only emboldens Iran's enemies. ""I hope 1391, which begins today, will be joyful for our nation,' Khamenei said. ""God almighty, defeat the enemies of this great nation.""","Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warns Iran will strike back if attacked .

"This time it was the United States that gave up the dramatic goal. Portugal's Silvestre Varela scored on a strong headed goal deep, deep in stoppage time to give Portugal a desperate 2-2 draw with the United States in a key Group G World Cup match at Manaus, Brazil. The goal, in the 95th minute, came off a cross from Cristiano Ronaldo, who showed no signs of a knee injury that was the subject of much media attention in the buildup to the contest. Second-half strikes by U.S. midfielder Jermaine Jones and striker Clint Dempsey had given the United States a 2-1 lead until Portugal rescued its World Cup chances. ""You're disappointed not to get three points, but at the same time you have to take the positives from the game,"" Dempsey said. ""We're happy with four points, and there's everything to play for in the last game."" The United States plays co-group leader Germany on Thursday while Ghana and Portugal square off. The Americans will win the group with a victory, but could also advance to the Round of 16 with a draw and a tie in the other match, which will be played at the same time. But if Ghana or Portugal wins and the other match also has a winner, tiebreakers --  the first being goal differential -- will determine the second-place team in the group. ""We gave our maximum,"" Ronaldo said, according to a CNN translation. ""We're obviously frustrated and sad with what happened."" The Portugal star wasn't counting on getting the arduous results his team needs Thursday to advance. ""There aren't miracles in football. We knew it was a difficult group. Either we could qualify or we'd get knocked out,"" he said. ""Honestly, I never thought we were going to be the world champion. Anything can happen, now we have to be humble."" Time to rally . The American goals made up for an early U.S. miscue that allowed Portugal to take a 1-0 lead when Nani scored after a U.S clearance attempt went awry. U.S. defender Geoff Cameron tried to knock away a cross, but the ball went to a wide-open Nani, who waited for U.S. goalkeeper Tim Howard to go down, then slammed home a shot from 6 yards in the fifth minute. ""You never want to get scored on, but it was good for us,"" said U.S. midfielder Kyle Beckerman, who thought the Americans picked up their play immediately after the goal. Jones scored a sweet goal after Portugal cleared a U.S. corner. The German-born player took a couple of touches that unleashed a wicked bending shot that left Portugal goalkeeper Beto standing helplessly still in the 64th minute. Dempsey scored in the 81st minute when midfielder Graham Zusi sent a ball toward goal that the U.S. star redirected into the net. Portugal, the fourth-ranked team in the world and one of the pre-tournament favorites in Group G, outshot the Americans 20 to 15. But Howard had four saves, including one that kept the U.S. from going down two goals. After a Nani shot ricocheted off the post, Howard swept away a rebound from Eder while reaching over his left shoulder. ""I don't think Portugal broke us down. I think we in a way let ourselves down,"" said Howard, who was named man of the match. ""So that's kind of a good sign because had we gotten torn apart, it would have been a lot tougher."" Lineup changes . The Portuguese team was missing defender Pepe through a red card suspension and striker Hugo Almeida and defender Fabio Coentrao, who were injured. Dempsey was playing with a broken nose that he said made it hard to breathe in the Americans' 2-1 dramatic win over Ghana on a late goal by substitute John Brooks. After the match, he said he made it through Sunday's contest without problems. The United States was missing striker Jozy Altidore, who has a strained left hamstring. Dempsey, normally a midfielder, moved to the top of the U.S. formation in Altidore's place while Zusi slid into the starting lineup. The game was played in the heat and humidity of the Amazon rainforest. The heat index was 93 degrees at kickoff, and the weather seemed to have an effect on the pace of the game as the match moved into the second 45 minutes. The referee even allowed a short water break in the first half, a first in a World Cup match. The second half was played at a much more measured pace until after the U.S. goals, when Portugal attacked with more intensity, searching for the score that would keep it from being eliminated from the tournament. The Americans, 13th in the FIFA rankings, were cheered on by about 20,000 red, white and blue fans at Arena Amazonia. The United States and Portugal are the final two of the 32 teams to play their second match. Monday features four matches, two in Group A and two in Group B, as several teams battle for spots and seedings in the next round while others that have been eliminated let some reserves get in a World Cup match.","U.S. was seconds from winning before Portugal's Silvestre Varela scored off Ronaldo cross .

"A former campaign aide for John Edwards said in court Friday that he had been intimidated in his dealings with the former senator and two high-priced donors. ""I was scared for my life,"" Andrew Young testified in U.S. District Court in Greensboro, North Carolina. ""I was up against two billionaires and a millionaire. I was scared. It was bizarre."" Prosecutors have argued that Edwards broke federal law by accepting about $725,000 from now-101-year-old heiress Rachel ""Bunny"" Mellon and more than $200,000 from Fred Baron, a Texas lawyer who has since died. Young is considered the government's star witness against Edwards, a former Democratic senator and presidential candidate from North Carolina who is accused of using hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations to conceal his affair with a campaign videographer without reporting the money to federal authorities. Edwards is facing six felony charges, including that he accepted illegal campaign donations. He also is charged with conspiracy and making false statements. Edwards' attorneys have argued that Young had instead been involved in what was largely a ruse to extract hundreds of thousands of dollars from the donors for personal use. During Friday's testimony, Young recalled a drive he took with Edwards in North Carolina in 2008. Edwards had learned that Young had received donations without his knowledge. ""I said if he won't tell the truth, I was going to tell the truth,"" Young told the court. Edwards responded, he said, ""You can't hurt me, Andrew. You can't hurt me."" Young's testimony comes a day after he was hammered on the witness stand about his own motives and asked whether he made up stories about how Edwards concealed contributions from campaign donors. The former aide said during cross-examination Thursday that ""we lost our perspective,"" acknowledging he used donations for personal expenses at a California home. Young said he used the funds in constructing a pool and a theater. Wednesday was the first day the defense cross-examined Young, and the attorneys focused mostly on apparent inconsistencies between Young's public statements and things he wrote in a book about the case. For example, Young has described a time when Edwards returned home from a trip overseas with a phone purportedly given to him by his mistress, Rielle Hunter. Young said Edwards was asleep when the phone rang, and Edwards' wife, Elizabeth, answered. Hunter began talking, assuming John Edwards was on the other end of the line. Under cross-examination, Young admitted he had no firsthand knowledge of the story. Defense attorney Abbe Lowell also questioned Young's assertion that Edwards refused to take a call from Hunter as she left for the hospital to have Edwards' baby, something Young described as ""bone-chilling"" in its disregard. Lowell pointed out Hunter later said Edwards had, in fact, called her. Edwards is accused of concealing the money from the public and the Federal Election Commission, which polices political contributions, by filing false and misleading campaign disclosure reports. Young is testifying for the prosecution under a cooperation agreement with the hope that he won't be prosecuted. Edwards could face up to 30 years in prison if convicted of all six felony and misdemeanor counts against him. Young is the author of the tell-all book ""The Politician: An Insider's Account of John Edwards's Pursuit of the Presidency and the Scandal That Brought Him Down."" He testified that he wrote the book for two reasons: ""It had been almost three years since Mr. Edwards promised me he would tell the truth, (and) we also very much needed the money.""","""I was scared for my life,"" Andrew Young testified Friday .

"Whether it's Mohammed becoming the most popular baby name, or one in 10 babies in England being Muslim or the fact that halal meat is being served in Pizza Hut, a Muslim story always tends to generate more heat than light. Indeed, Islamophobia is often perpetuated by fear and a sense that Muslims are taking over our jobs, our homes and our lives, thus leading to a polarizing society and the so-called clash of civilizations. And it's common to see issues such as the name of Mohammed being used by the far-right into vitriolic hate against Muslims. Take for example the Daily Mail headline in January 2014: ""One in 10 babies in England is a Muslim: Those practising the religion 'could soon outnumber actively worshipping Christians.'"" The article, which was accompanied by an image of two Muslim women wearing the face veil, showed this pervading sense of online anti-Muslim hate emerge with comments such as: ""Surprise, surprise, ban the burka now before its too late!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" and ""This has to stop this is a Christian country the next thing sharia law."" Improving media practices and media responsibility on portraying and reporting fairly on Islam and British Muslims, without bias or discrimination or intent to incite anti-Muslim prejudice, is important. The media must provide a more responsible, objective and proportionate way of reporting on stories. Unfortunately, though, the stories above are not isolated. In The Sun last year an article entitled, ""Ramadan a ding-dong,"" again provided a sensationalized and biased viewpoint that seeks to undermine all Muslims and portray Islam in a negative light. As a result, we are seeing British Muslims as a group suffer as a result of bad journalism that fuels extremist and far-right fringe groups such as Anjem Choudary and Muslims for Crusades. Sadly, stories such as these help to create an atmosphere that has demonized Muslims and fueled an anti-Muslim narrative. Indeed, such reporting and representation of British Muslims also helps create the framework for the ""othering"" of communities and in particular may influence people's perceptions of Muslims, especially when combined with lazy journalism that fails to correctly represent the true facts of each case. Let's not forget, for example, the story from 2010, when windows were being covered up at a central English leisure center. The Daily Mail headlined its story: ""Swimmers plunged into dark after council covers swimming pool windows 'to protect Muslim women's modesty."" The council revealed later though that the requests to black out the windows had not come solely from the Muslim community. And we also know from previous studies looking at media coverage about Muslims, in particular post 9/11, that the weight of news stories -- even if individually factually accurate -- often stereotypes Muslims in an overwhelmingly negative light. For example, a study conducted by academics at Cardiff University found that the majority of news coverage post-9/11 about Muslims was negative. Their research into media coverage of British Muslims found that at least two-thirds of newspaper articles were focused around stories on terrorism. These stories often used the words such as ""militancy"" and ""radicalism"" to depict Muslims in an overtly negative fashion and were a product of a wider anti-Muslim prejudice which they found across British newspapers. Interestingly, they also found that common adjectives used to describe Muslims included the words ""'radical,"" ""fanatical"" and ""fundamentalist."" So whether it's getting stories factually incorrect or describing Muslims as a security threat, there is clearly a backlash against Muslims online and offline with threatening comments that are both extremely inflammatory and promote Islamophobia. This negativity is framed within the construct that Muslims are dangerous people, and creates a ""them vs. us"" mentality that can be highly damaging for community relations. Now is the time for action to reverse this trend, and as Mehdi Hasan suggests, ""sanctions for dishonest and demonizing press coverage of Muslims"" might be one way to ensure that we start to see a balanced coverage that does not demonize or stereotype Muslims.","Islamophobia is often perpetuated by fear, sense that Muslims are taking over our jobs, says Imran Awan .

"President Barack Obama and his certain Republican opponent in November, Mitt Romney, shifted to full general election mode Wednesday, portraying each other as threats to future American progress as their campaigns engaged in a ""war over women"" indicative of what to expect for the next seven months. A day after his path to the GOP nomination cleared by chief rival Rick Santorum's withdrawal, Romney sought to reverse a gender gap problem by attacking Obama's economic policies as bad for women. According to a Washington Post/ABC News poll released Tuesday, Romney trails well behind Obama among women voters -- a result also seen in recent Gallup and CNN/ORC polls. Obama had the support of 57% of women, compared with 38% who said they backed Romney, while Romney had the backing of 52% of men, compared with 44% who backed Obama, the survey found. In a speech in Delaware at a woman-owned small business, Romney referred Wednesday to a Democratic attack line that Republicans were waging a ""war on women"" through socially conservative policies involving abortion, health care and other issues by saying: ""The real war on women is being waged by the president's failed economic policies."" ""Now the president says, 'Oh I didn't cause this recession.' That's true,"" Romney said. ""He just made it worse, and made it last longer. And because it lasted longer, more and more women lost jobs, such that in his three-and-a-half years, 92.3% of the people who lost jobs have been women. His failures have hurt women."" However, the nonpartisan website PolitiFact.com rated the 92.3% job loss statement ""mostly false,"" saying it included figures from the beginning of the Obama administration, before his policies could take effect. In addition, PolitiFact.com said the figure failed to reflect a historical pattern of recessions first causing unemployment in traditionally male-dominated industries such as construction, and then later affecting fields with larger percentages of female workers. The Romney campaign later provided a copy of a letter it sent to PolitiFact.com that challenged the ""mostly false"" rating. An analysis of federal labor statistics shows that the Romney claim is technically true but lacks important context. The number of nonfarm-employed women from January 2009, when Obama took office, to March 2012 fell far more than the number of employed men in that period. The total job loss for the period for both men and women combined was 740,000. The number of women who lost nonfarm jobs in that time span was 683,000, according to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That amounts to 92.3% -- the figure Romney cited. However, the statistic does not reflect that men constituted a much larger chunk of the job loss pie in the year leading up to Obama's inauguration. In the 2008 calendar year, men lost a total of 2.7 million nonfarm jobs, compared with 895,000 jobs lost for women. Men made up 75.4% of the 3.6 million jobs lost that year. Romney's claim also does not reflect that the job losses for women began in March 2008, almost a full year before Obama took office. At that point, women held a total of 67.3 million nonfarm payroll jobs, the highest level of female employment of the Bush administration. From that high point, the number of women with nonfarm payroll jobs fell for 23 consecutive months, spanning from the final 10 months of the Bush administration and first 13 months of the Obama administration. Since February 2010, women have actually gained 863,000 jobs. Meanwhile, a Romney adviser initially hesitated when asked if Romney supported the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act that expands workers' rights to sue in the event of a pay discrepancy between a man and a woman. ""We'll get back to you on that,"" Romney Campaign Policy Director Lanhee Chen told reporters. A Romney campaign statement afterward said the candidate supported pay equity for women, but it did not specifically say he backed the 2009 Ledbetter law. The Obama campaign immediately fired back, issuing a statement from Ledbetter that criticized Romney for failing to ""stand up for women and their families."" ""Anyone who wants to be president of the United States shouldn't have to think about whether they support pursuing every possible avenue to ensuring women get the same pay for the same work as men,"" Ledbetter said in the statement. A Romney campaign official later said that  the candidate had no plans to change the current pay equity laws if elected. David Axelrod, the senior adviser to Obama's campaign, called it a ""tough day"" for Romney's efforts to repair damage with women voters stemming from the Republican primary campaign. Axelrod dubbed the those efforts the ""Mitt Rehab with Women Tour"" in a Twitter post. Obama, meanwhile, continued his push for Congress to pass a tax measure that would ensure that millionaires -- like Romney -- pay a higher tax rate than middle-class workers. ""It's just plain wrong that middle-class Americans pay a higher share of their income in taxes than some millionaires and billionaires,"" Obama told a White House event, flanked by millionaires who support the proposed measure. Republicans want to cut taxes for the wealthy, which would mean cutting spending on programs that spur economic growth and benefit the middle class, senior citizens and the poor, Obama argued. ""They want to double down on some of the inequities that already exist in the tax code,"" he said, adding that such a step means ""either you've got to borrow more money to pay down a deeper deficit, or you've got to demand deeper sacrifices from the middle class and you've got to cut investments that help us grow as an economy."" Citing ""significant"" deficits and the need to be competitive in the 21st century's ""technologically integrated economy,"" Obama said: ""We can't afford to keep spending more money on tax cuts for wealthy Americans who don't need them and weren't even asking for them."" In a swipe at GOP economic policy, Obama added: ""In America, prosperity has never just trickled down from the wealthy few."" Also Wednesday, the Obama campaign released a video highlighting Romney's conservative stances on issues such as abortion rights, health care reform and immigration reform. The video concludes with Romney's declaration on the campaign trail that he was ""a severely conservative Republican governor."" The competing messages were attempts by both sides to frame what is expected to be a close and vicious general election campaign in a favorable perspective. Obama portrays Romney and Republicans as protectors of the wealthy at the expense of the middle class, while Romney and his party say Obama has stifled economic recovery and failed to effectively tackle deficit reduction. Romney still needs to win several hundred delegates to clinch the GOP nomination, but Santorum was his top remaining challenger, and Tuesday's announcement that Santorum suspended his campaign leaves Romney's path free of obstacles. However, Romney's campaign still struggles to generate enthusiasm among the GOP conservative base, which questions his more moderate stances as Massachusetts governor. Sources said Romney wants Santorum -- who had strong support among social conservatives, including Christian evangelicals -- to quickly endorse his campaign. While Romney and Santorum aides said the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania will work to defeat Obama, it was unclear when or if Santorum would offer a full-throated endorsement for Romney. In his announcement Tuesday that he was suspending his campaign, Santorum never mentioned Romney. ""I expect when I finally become the nominee, and I hope that happens soon, that we'll be campaigning together, we'll be working together,"" Romney said Wednesday. ""We share very much the same beliefs about the course the nation must take and the fact that under this president, America is not going in the right direction."" Santorum has consistently said Republicans needed a true conservative candidate -- himself -- to defeat Obama, and he has relentlessly attacked Romney's support for health care reforms in Massachusetts that included a mandate for coverage similar to the 2010 federal health care law despised by conservatives. Romney said he would try to attract Santorum's evangelical and socially conservative supporters by leveraging appearances with the former candidate. ""We campaign together and make sure we see these people and get a chance to talk to them about issues that all Americans care about,"" Romney said. ""I think you see our party, and you will see our party more united than it's been in a long, long time, in part because President Obama has taken America in such a different course than we have ever gone as a nation before."" Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Texas Rep. Ron Paul, the other Republican challengers who trail far back, said they intended to stay in the race to the GOP convention in August. The Obama campaign immediately took aim at Romney after Santorum's announcement, with campaign manager Jim Messina saying it was ""no surprise that Mitt Romney finally was able to grind down his opponents under an avalanche of negative ads."" ""The more the American people see of Mitt Romney, the less they like him and the less they trust him,"" Messina said in a statement. ""While calling himself the 'ideal candidate' for the tea party, he has promised to return to the same policies that created the economic crisis and has alienated women, middle-class families and Hispanic Americans."" CNN's latest estimate of the GOP delegate tally shows Romney with 659, Santorum with 275, Gingrich with 140 and Paul with 71. It takes 1,144 delegates to clinch the nomination. New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware vote on April 24, in addition to Pennsylvania. In all, 231 delegates are up for grabs in the five states. The goal now for Gingrich and Paul is to prevent Romney from reaching the 1,144-delegate threshold before the convention. On Wednesday, though, Gingrich spent time explaining how a technical glitch caused his campaign to bounce a $500 check for Utah primary election fees.","Mitt Romney seeks to fix his gender gap problem against President Obama .

"(CNN)He has faced menacing bouncers and even once had to duck a glass of milk propelled at pace from his father's hands, but it was an encounter with a different aggressor that proved cricketer Yuvraj Singh's most frightening opponent. The mercurial all-rounder had been in the form of his life at the 2011 Cricket World Cup, helping India win their first title in almost three decades when they beat Sri Lanka by six wickets in the final at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium. Yuvraj had particular cause to celebrate after putting in a series of match-winning performances -- his tally of 362 runs and 15 wickets in nine matches earned him the ""Man of the Tournament"" award. ""Everything came together at the World Cup and it was something really special. And just being together as a team, lifting the World Cup was a dream come true,"" Yuvraj told CNN's Human to Hero series. But as each new chapter in that Indian sporting fairy tale was being written a more sinister narrative was unfolding deep inside Yuvraj's body. ""I was coughing a lot. I was not able to breathe on my left side. I was struggling to breathe throughout the whole tournament (and) spitting a little bit of blood at times during games,"" he recalls. After the World Cup he went for a scan that revealed a tumor in his chest cavity, but a combination of denial and disbelief saw him carry on pretty much as normal. ""Even when I was diagnosed, I kept ignoring it because I still wanted to play and I didn't believe it could happen to an athlete like me who had been training and keeps himself fit."" So off he went on tour to England that summer and in November he played two Test matches at home against the West Indies. It was only the following January, when results of further tests confirmed the tumor was malignant -- a germ cell cancer called a mediastinal seminoma was diagnosed -- that Yuvraj was forced to face his worst fears and seek treatment. ""It was located between my heart and my (left) lung and it grew about 14 centimeters like a ball over my chest which was a concern."" Yuvraj sought the expertise of Lawrence Einhorn, a U.S. doctor who had successfully treated cyclist, Lance Armstrong for testicular cancer in the 1990s, and underwent chemotherapy at the IU Simon Cancer Center in Indianapolis in early 2012. ""I had three sessions of chemotherapy so it was really tough, it was hard to go through it. But while I was going through my treatment, I was always motivated that I was going to come back and play for India. I think that's what kept me going and got me through."" Yuvraj had enjoyed a stellar career up to then, playing Test, One-Day International and T20 cricket for India, making his senior debut in 2000 at the age of 19. A sparkling 84 off 80 balls in his first innings in a one-day match against Australia served notice of his talent, and it was in limited overs cricket that he was most at home on the international stage. The left-hander has fluently notched more than 8,000 one-day runs, which have included 13 hundreds and 51 half-centuries, and when he's on his game his assaults on opposition bowling attacks have displayed a brutal beauty. It was four years before his heroics with bat and ball in 2011 that Yuvraj had made himself a household name, smashing six sixes in an over off England paceman, Stuart Broad during the inaugural Twenty20 World Cup. Previously only Herschelle Gibbs had recorded such a feat in international cricket. ""I would say it's one of the biggest highlights of my career because wherever I go and whenever I speak to people or my friends, they always mention they remember you hitting six sixes. It's a very special moment in my cricketing career."" Unlike a lot of kids growing up in India, where cricket is the national game, Yuvraj didn't care much for the sport preferring to play tennis and go roller skating during his early childhood in Chandigarh, a small town five hours north of New Delhi. But his father, Yograj, who had represented India at cricket in the early 1980s, had other ideas and was hell-bent on seeing his son following in his footsteps. ""My father was an international player but he didn't play much, so he wanted to continue his dream through me. He pushed me a lot into cricket and I eventually started liking it and I think I was destined to play."" The intense parental expectation of the elder Singh is laid bare in Yuvraj's autobiography. Writing in ""The Test of My Life,"" Yuvraj recalls an incident when his father exploded with rage after hearing that his son had been dismissed in a practice match. ""I was once out for 39, hitting the ball in the air and Dad got to hear about the dismissal. That evening he went back home and told Mom, 'Tell Yuvi not to enter the house or I will kill him',"" Yuvraj wrote in the book published in 2013. After spending the night in his car, Yuvraj returned to the house the next morning when his father had gone out. But then he unexpectedly came back. ""Without warning, he picked up the glass full of milk on the table and threw it straight at me. It missed my head and broke the glass pane of the window behind where I was sitting. Then I received the full volley of his abuse."" His father has had to deal with his own cancer diagnosis in recent months -- reportedly undergoing treatment for cancer of the vocal chords last year -- but happily Yuvraj remains clear of the disease. His wish to represent his country again was granted when he returned to play in three Tests against England at the end of 2012 and a string of one-day and T20 international appearances followed in 2013 and last year. But, as he's first to admit, his form has been patchy since recovering from cancer. ""I've had a little bit of up and down in the last two to three years and that was bound to happen and I've taken that in my stride. I've worked very hard on my game and I look forward to doing good things for India again."" He would have been the romantic's choice for a place in India squad for next month's Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand but he wasn't named in the 15-man squad announced by India's national selectors at the beginning of January. Still, the 33-year-old is still much in demand elsewhere. Last season, he was the most expensive player in the Indian Premier League auction, snapped up for Rs 14 crore ($2.25 million) by the Royal Challengers Bangalore. In addition to regular appearances for his state side Punjab, he is kept busy with his cancer foundation, YouWeCan, which raises awareness and funds to fight the disease. ""I definitely think I'm inspiring a lot of people,"" he says. ""Trust me, it's not easy to get out of it. It's something which kills you from inside and it takes a lot out of you, your family members and your friends to see what you're going through. That's why I'm trying to motivate people and try to help them get their life back."" It's a positive message from a man who could have been forgiven for letting his sporting career fade in the face of such trauma. But his love for cricket remains as strong as ever. ""It's a sport which never flows in one direction, it's always up and down. You never know which way it's going to go. I just love the unpredictability.""","India cricketer Yuvraj Singh was World Cup hero for India in 2011 .

"If you weren't lucky enough to win a seat at the table for dinner tonight with George Clooney and President Barack Obama, fear not. You may still have a chance to party with the president and a celebrity or two in the near future. Two lucky Obama supporters will join Clooney, the president and 150 other guests who ponied up an estimated $6 million to dine at the movie star's Los Angeles home for a dinner Thursday. The raffle earned the campaign another $9 million, according to the campaign. And, following Obama's historic announcement in support of same-sex marriage Wednesday, the haul from Hollywood may only increase. Live blog: What they are saying about Obama's decision . For the president, this celebrity support is becoming routine. A CNN analysis of Federal Elections Commission fundraising data shows dozens of A-listers lending their fame and fortune to both candidates, with Hollywood leaning heavily toward Obama. Celebrities have always played a role in presidential campaigns, but experts say they have never seen this kind of involvement on this scale. Those who list TV/movies/music as their profession in donation records are one of the largest groups raising money for Obama this election. Dinner with Clooney, Obama nets $15 million . According to Opensecrets.org, as of April celebrity bundlers have already contributed some $6,950,000 to Obama's campaign. That's before Thursday's Clooney event, which is being billed as the largest single-event fundraising opportunity for an individual presidential campaign. A campaign insider told CNN it could bring in some $15 million. While Obama's donor list does include longtime Democratic contributors like Steven Spielberg, Kris Kristofferson and actor Danny DeVito, the list is also studded with celebrity names that are new to politics. Stars like Jamie Foxx, John Legend, Jada Pinkett Smith, Jane Lynch, and Hilary Duff are on the individual donor list. They've already contributed $2,500, the maximum amount an individual can legally give to a candidate directly. Interactive: Who is donating? As far as donors to Mitt Romney's campaign, you've got to look long and hard at his FEC records to find a recognizable name like producer Jerry Bruckheimer or the WWE's Vincent McMahon. Both have given $2,500 to his campaign. Other celebrities -- like rockers Gene Simmons from Kiss and Kid Rock -- say they support Romney and have appeared at his rallies, but have yet to turn up on the donor list. ""As we get closer to the convention that could change,"" said Kirsten Kukowski, the Republican National Committee press secretary. She adds she doesn't think Romney needs celebrities like the president does. ""We have the message -- we don't need big names to sell it and distract people from what we should really be talking about, which is jobs and how to fix the economy."" George Clooney is not the first celebrity to hold a glitzy fundraiser this season. In March, filmmaker Tyler Perry became a campaign bundler for Obama's re-election when he held a couple of large fundraisers at his studio in Atlanta. About 1,000 people bought tickets for $500 to $2,500 a pop to attend the president's speech. Forty of those guests, including Oprah Winfrey, paid $35,000 per person to attend an exclusive dinner with the president at Perry's private estate, with proceeds going to the Obama Victory Fund. The fundraiser made Perry one of the president's biggest bundlers -- those who organize and gather donations from others -- in the $500,000+ category. Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria, who the campaign named as an official national co-chair, became a bundler for Obama in October. She co-hosted a fundraiser for the president at the Los Angeles home of Antonio Banderas and Melanie Griffith. Asked why she is so active, Longoria said, ""I support President Obama because he is on the right side of issues that matter to Latinos and women."" Having Longoria stumping on the campaign trail reaches a part of the population that might not already be paying attention to the campaign, according to historian Steve Ross. ""If you have Eva Longoria doing community events, you may get bigger Hispanic support because they may feel some kind of kinship with her,"" said Ross, who wrote the book ""Hollywood Left and Right: How Movie Stars Shaped American Politics."" ""It's not just about the money with George Clooney or any other big named celebrity fundraiser,"" he said. ""It's also about the coverage that fundraiser generates outside the usual mainstream news. This way, you show up on the entertainment programs and create buzz in social media. It's about trying to reach the 50% who don't vote. An endorsement from 'celebrity x' may make you pay more attention to the campaign, and once you take a closer look you may go out and vote for them."" Plus, Ross says, Hollywood is a geographically desirable area to raise money. ""It's the easiest place for a candidate to come to a concentrated industry,"" Ross said. ""To generate support from the financial services industry, Romney needs to travel to New York and to Silicon Valley. To reach the movie industry, it's all pretty closely based around L.A. It's one-stop shopping, in a sense."" Kukowski says involving celebrities in Obama's campaign the last time did work, but she believes with the bad economy, voters are in a much different place. ""We no longer want a celebrity for president or someone who pals around with Hollywood stars. We want someone who will keep their nose to the grindstone, who will create jobs, rather than spend all this time trying to be BFF's with George Clooney."" What ultimately do celebrities like Clooney get by becoming a part of a campaign? When asked why Clooney is such a big supporter, his publicist Stan Rosenfeld in an e-mail said, ""We will not be issuing any statements or comments about the event."" Historian Steve Ross speculates it's about access. ""Someone in the White House will definitely take your call if you are a supporter,"" Ross said. Actors like George Clooney, who has campaigned for humane intervention in Sudan, do get meetings with the White House. ""It doesn't buy you the president, but it definitely buys you an opportunity to have your voice heard.""","A CNN analysis shows celebs have donated nearly $7 million to Obama so far .

"A long-awaited State Department environmental report on the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline indicates what the oil industry and its backers have been saying -- it won't have a big impact on carbon emissions that cause climate change. The report released Friday appears to give the Obama administration the cover it needs to approve the politically charged project, but not until May at the earliest, after a 90-day review and comment period. Environmentalists reacted with predictable fury, accusing the government of bad intent by releasing the report before an inspector general's findings on whether it was flawed because some participants had oil industry ties. ""This document will be seen by the entire environmental community ... as a sham,"" complained Democratic Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona, adding that ""it encourages the already widely held impression that the fix was in from the beginning."" White House spokesman Matt Lehrich said Friday night that information in the report ""will now need to be closely evaluated by Secretary (of State John) Kerry and other relevant agency heads in the weeks ahead. ""A decision on whether the project is in the national interest will be made only after careful consideration of the (report) and other pertinent information, comments from the public, and views of other agency heads."" GOP: no more stalling . Supporters, including Republican leaders who have been pushing for two years for President Barack Obama to approve the project, said now it was time to get it started. ""Mr. President, no more stalling, no more excuses,"" said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, adding a jab at Obama's recent pledge to act on his own this year if he can't get congressional backing. ""Please pick up that pen you've been talking so much about and make this happen. Americans need these jobs."" The pipeline that would transport oil from Canada to the Gulf Coast has been a political football, pitting the oil industry and its Republican backers against environmentalists and liberal Democrats who complain it bolsters the especially dirty fossil fuel production from the tar sands of northern Alberta. The project also has sparked protests from the political left and the environmental movement. However, the politics get messy for Democrats, because organized labor supports the project that will create several thousand jobs. Release of the report launched a 90-day period for public comment and consultation. Secretary of State John Kerry, who is known for his effort to combat climate change, will then determine if the pipeline project is in the national interest. The environmental analysis makes no final conclusion on the merits of the project, but says it wouldn't impact how much oil gets produced from Canada's tar sands in northern Alberta. Dirtier oil . Approval or denial of any single project was unlikely to affect how much oil gets extracted from the tar sands, Assistant Secretary of State Kerri-Ann Jones said in a conference call with reporters. Jones noted that the oil from the tar sands was more carbon intensive than normal oil, producing 17% more carbon emissions. Environmentalists say that is why the project should be rejected, arguing that it would continue U.S. reliance on a dirtier foreign oil at a time when Obama has pledged action against climate change. ""I will not be satisfied with any analysis that does not accurately document what is really happening on the ground when it comes to the extraction, transport, refining, and waste disposal of dirty, filthy tar sands oil,"" said Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer of California. In a speech last year on climate change, Obama said the pipeline should be approved only if it is basically carbon-neutral, meaning that approving it would have no more impact on climate change that not approving it. The president and CEO of TransCanada, the company proposing the pipeline, said Friday that the environmental report makes clear the benefits of the project to the U.S. economy, including $3.4 billion in added economic activity from its construction. Asked about increased carbon emissions, Russ Girling said the report determined that ""oil sands are gonna get produced anyway."" ""When you read the report carefully, it makes clear that blocking Keystone is an important component of climate sanity and we will find out if John Kerry and particularly Barack Obama  are ever willing to stand up to the oil industry or not,"" said environmental activist Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org. Messy politics for Democrats . Democrats from energy states, such as Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, face tough re-election battles this fall and therefore want to see the pipeline approved to help a major industry for their constituents. They have criticized the administration for taking several years to review it. This year, Obama has made holding onto the Senate in November a political priority. In 2011, the Obama administration postponed a decision on the pipeline until last year, citing concerns raised by Nebraska officials and environmental groups about the original route near the Ogallala Aquifer, which provides drinking water for much of Nebraska and is important for the state's agricultural economy. Republicans accused Obama of putting off the issue until after the November 2012 election, but their efforts to force an earlier decision failed to work. Meanwhile, TransCanada rerouted it in Nebraska. The State Department is handling the review because the project crosses an international border with Canada.","Pipeline supporters approve, environmentalists condemn the report .

"It's astounding how fast the words of a 22-year-old woman, her life suddenly cut short, have spread across the Internet and into the hearts and minds of people all over the world. Marina Keegan, a budding writer, was once published by the New York Times and had a job lined up at the New Yorker. Also a playwright, she had a musical slated for a staging in August at the New York International Fringe Festival. She wrote a moving essay in the Yale Daily News to inspire her fellow seniors as they graduated last week. She died in a car crash a few days later. That column, in which she strives to remind her peers that ""we have so much time,"" has taken on a tragic, powerful resonance. Discussing the ""immense and indefinable potential energy"" many felt as freshmen, she wrote that it's important to remember ""we can still do anything. We can change our minds. We can start over. ... We're so young. We can't, we MUST not lose this sense of possibility because in the end, it's all we have."" The loss of Keegan is heartbreaking for many reasons. One of them is that she surely would have been among the too few people in the world who chase their dreams and bring them to fruition. I know what it is to feel the ""sense of possibility"" she described. I felt it when I was at Yale in the '90s. Since then, I've lived by it. I've also had time to see what distinguishes those who chase dreams from those who give up. Two friends of mine, fellow Yalies who graduated in different years and don't know each other, told me that in the years after college, they felt ""betrayed"" by some friends who had wonderful plans for the future and swiftly gave up on them. People who didn't harness their creativity to carve new paths. People who became focused on making more and more money and little else, who never took chances, because they got too busy, more interested in wealth or stature than doing something amazing, or just forgot about those dreams. In each case, I asked my friend how that amounted to betrayal. And each gave me the same answer: The plans we had for the future weren't just plans or hopes. They were a pact. We would take the education and incredible opportunities we had been given and go out and fight for a better world in new ways. Separately, together. It's what Keegan touched on in her last line to her class: ""We're in this together, 2012. Let's make something happen to this world."" As I've written before, the world needs more visionaries. From electricity to vaccines to Hubble, everything humanity has created that improves our lives exists because dreamers pursued their visions. It's not easy, and it can become harder as you grow up and have families dependent on you. Life exhausts and distracts you into shelving aspirations. Making them happen is hard work. But it's incomparably rewarding. There is every reason to believe that Keegan would have fought for hers. It's clear in her writing. Written from the perspective of a young woman at the dawn of her adult life, her words are a stunning bookend to something David Brooks wrote about in October in the New York Times: a collection of short autobiographies that members of the Yale class of 1942 wrote for their 50th reunion. People who ""passively let their lives happen to them"" lamented ""how boring they must seem,"" while others ""regret the risk not taken,"" Brooks wrote. ""The most exciting essays were written by the energetic, restless people, who took their lives off in new directions midcourse."" Anyone with an unfulfilled dream would do well to keep that in mind -- and should read Keegan's column, because it applies to them as well. The essays by people who ""felt summoned to do one thing,"" Brooks added, ""ring with passion and conviction."" That's about instincts, which are ultimately the key to chasing dreams and the biggest driver for those of us who don't give up. We let ourselves tune out everything else and listen to what our instincts are telling us we have to do. That's why nothing can stop us. It's easy to imagine that nothing would have stopped Keegan. Her death is also a reminder of a daily tragedy. While U.S. fatalities in car crashes are decreasing, far too many families and friends know the pain of such loss. Keegan, above all else, valued family and friends. In this, she seemed wise beyond her years. I was -- like many other ambitious young people -- so focused on career goals, it took me years to gain the perspective she had and live by the knowledge that the loved ones you surround yourself with are by far the most important thing in life. ""We don't have a word for the opposite of loneliness, but if we did, I could say that's what I want in life,"" she wrote. Yale graduates from 70 years before her say the same. ""For almost all, family and friends mattered most,"" Brooks wrote. Keegan's words give us all reason to remember the world of possibilities before us and to make sure we're valuing time with loved ones. In her death, she just may be inspiring people to live better, deeper, more exciting lives -- with ""passion and conviction."" And that's unforgettable.","Josh Levs: Marina Keegan, a new Yale grad off to promising future, was killed in crash .
He says she embodied idea of reaching for, achieving dreams; was writer, playwright .
He says some fellow grads who hoped for great things found life intervened .

"Hours after President Barack Obama said the fatal shooting of an unarmed African-American teen in Florida requires national ""soul searching,"" a lawyer for the man at the center of an investigation said the shooting had nothing to do with race. ""I asked him, 'Are you a racist? Do you have anything against black people?' and he said 'No',"" George Zimmerman's legal adviser Craig Sonner told CNN. Sonner said Zimmerman and his wife served as mentors to two teenage children of an African-American woman. Though funding was cut for the program, the couple continued their efforts on their own, taking the 13-year-old girl and 14-year-old boy on outings to a mall, a science center and a basketball game. They also helped in a fundraiser for an African-American church, the lawyer said. ""I do not believe that's the indication of a person who's a racist,"" Sonner said. ""I don't see anything that indicates to me that he's a racist."" Trayvon Martin, 17, died February 26. Police say he was shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Florida, who said he was acting in self-defense. Martin was unarmed, carrying a bag of Skittles candy and an iced tea, according to police. Although a grand jury is scheduled to convene April 10 to look into the case, authorities have declined to arrest Zimmerman, sparking a national debate over Florida's ""stand your ground"" deadly force law amid concerns about racial profiling. The family of Zimmerman, a white Hispanic, said he has been wrongly described as a racist. Obama spoke out publicly Friday for the first time on the matter. ""When I think about this boy, I think about my own kids,"" Obama told reporters in response to a question. ""And I think every parent in America should be able to understand why it is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this and that everybody pulls together -- federal, state and local -- to figure out exactly how this tragedy happened."" Obama praised Florida Gov. Rick Scott's decision to create a task force to review the ""stand your ground"" law and said that it would be important to ""examine the laws and the context for what happened as well as the specifics of the incident."" ""But my main message is to the parents of Trayvon,"" Obama said. ""I think they are right to expect that all of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves and we will get to the bottom of exactly what happened,"" he said. And he obliquely addressed the racial component of the case, saying it struck home for him because, ""If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon."" The teenager's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, said in a statement that it was ""humbling"" that Obama had talked about their son. ""The president's personal comments touch us deeply and made us wonder: If his son looked like Trayvon and wore a hoodie, would he be suspicious, too?"" Martin was wearing a hooded sweatshirt the day he was killed. The case unfolded when Zimmerman, who was patrolling his gated community, saw Martin walking in the neighborhood. Zimmerman called 911 and reported what he described as a suspicious person. Moments later, several neighbors called the emergency number to report a commotion outside. Police arrived to find Martin dead of a gunshot wound. Authorities say they have not charged Zimmerman because they have no evidence to contradict his story that he shot in self-defense. Sonner told CNN that Zimmerman was injured on the night of the killing. ""I believe that his nose was broken; he sustained injury to his nose and on the back of his head he sustained a cut that was serious enough it probably should have had stitches,"" Sonner said. But by the time Zimmerman reached a doctor, ""there was an option not to stitch it up because it had already started healing, is my understanding,"" said the lawyer, who has talked with his client only by telephone. Sonner said the injures ""were from Trayvon Martin, I assume."" The lawyer said he and Zimmerman had not discussed what happened the night Martin was shot, though he said that Zimmerman has talked with authorities -- unaccompanied by counsel -- whenever they have asked him to do so. Sonner said he has advised his client to keep a low profile. ""I believe his life is in danger,"" said Sonner. ""This case is spinning out of control,"" he said. ""I hope there's a way to rein things in so it doesn't become an issue of a racial battle. I hope that things come back so that there can be a time for justice and for healing and not for just skipping the whole judicial process and going straight to sentencing."" Police have taken the gun used in the shooting and are holding it as evidence, he said. ""Whatever transpired that night, it's unfortunate that there's a young man in the prime of his life that was left dead,"" Sonner added. Opinion: What every black mother fears . Neighbors call watch leader caring, polite . Case sparks dialogue on racial inequality . Heated debate has erupted over whether Zimmerman used a racial slur during the 911 call, which was released this week. Did shooter use a racial slur? A top CNN audio engineer enhanced the sound of the 911 call, and several members of CNN's editorial staff repeatedly reviewed the tape but could reach no consensus. The case has prompted a Justice Department investigation, which is in the fact-finding stage. Whether Zimmerman used such language before shooting Martin is key, according to CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. ""It's extremely, extremely significant, because the federal government is not allowed to prosecute just your ordinary, everyday murder,"" he said. ""Two people fighting on the street is not a federal crime. However, if one person shoots another based on racial hostility, racial animus, that does become a federal crime."" Photos: Million Hoodie March . A special prosecutor appointed by Gov. Scott, Angela Corey, said Friday that her office can charge Zimmerman, clear him or send the case to the grand jury. Rallies and protests also continued Friday. Congressional staffers rallied in an event dubbed ""Hoodies on the Hill"" organized by several staff organizations, while students walked out of classes at six Miami-area high schools to protest police handling of the case and demand changes in Florida's law. At Southridge High School in Southridge, students lined up on the football field to form the initials, ""T.M."" Miami-Dade County Public Schools issued a statement saying Martin's mother asked students to focus instead on signing petitions, attending rallies and praying. ""Our most important mission is to provide a safe learning environment for students, and so we are asking them to respect the wishes of Trayvon's mother by celebrating his memory not through walkouts, but through reflection and civic participation,"" Superintendent Alberto Caralho said. Students walk out in protest over shooting death . Demonstrations were planned over the weekend in South Carolina and Virginia and Monday in Sanford and Atlanta. Shooting renews debate over 'stand your ground' laws . Amid the protests and calls for reform, some Florida lawmakers said it was time to revisit the 2005 ""stand your ground"" law, which eliminated a long-standing provision requiring people facing danger outside of their homes to first attempt to retreat before meeting a threat with force. Toobin: Does Florida law let killers go free? Since the law's adoption, the number of justifiable homicide rulings in Florida has nearly tripled, according to the state Department of Law Enforcement. ""We foretold that this would happen while we debated this law and a lot of us voted against it,"" Florida state Rep. Christopher Smith told CNN on Friday. ""They turned a blind eye to it. But now that America's looking at Florida, now people are starting to react and starting to really recognize what we were saying back in 2005 in the Florida House."" But a co-sponsor of the law, Sen. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, said the law was not at fault. He credited the statute for a ""serious decrease"" in violent crime. Baxley said it is up to the grand jury to decide whether any laws were broken, but left no doubt where he stands. ""Quite frankly, anyone who steps out in a pursuit in a confrontational mode with a firearm? That's not a self-protection act. You've initiated something."" He said one good outcome of the killing may be clarification over how the law ought to be applied. ""Maybe we do need some direction,"" he said. ""Maybe we need to give direction to Crime Watch."" Police chief steps aside 'temporarily' The incident has damaged relations between the Sanford Police Department and the city's African-American residents, City Manager Norton Bonaparte said Friday. ""We have to start from ground zero,"" he said. The depths to which community relations had sunk was underscored by the arrest Friday of a 68-year-old Melbourne Beach white man for allegedly threatening to harm  Bill Lee, who stepped down ""temporarily"" on Thursday as Sanford's police chief. ""You and your family deserve to be hunted down and shot like a dog, just like Trayvon Martin,"" says the e-mail that led to the arrest. ""Your entire police department is nothing more than a collection of incompetent, bigoted, unprofessional a**holes.""","""I believe his life is in danger,"" Zimmerman's lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- Recently, an organization called Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. filed a lawsuit against Harvard University, alleging that its admissions practices violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act for ""intentionally discriminating against applicants on the basis of race"" -- specifically, against Asian Americans. (A second, similar lawsuit was filed against the University of North Carolina -- Chapel Hill.) The lawsuit alleges that Harvard has, through the use of ""holistic"" consideration of applicants, ""systematically"" excluded qualified Asian Americans in favor of less qualified black and Latino applicants in an attempt to illegally achieve ""racial balancing."" Here's the thing. This lawsuit -- and the organization that filed it -- is not the affirmative action crusade it may seem, and I will get to that in a minute. As an Asian American graduate of Harvard, I read this news with dismay, both because I share a lot in common with the plaintiff at the core of the suit -- let's call her Jane Dou -- and because my personal experience has been so fundamentally different. You see, both she and I are second-generation Asian Americans, the children of immigrants who saw preparing us for higher education as their fundamental responsibility. It's a common running joke among second-generation Asian Americans that our parents start us on college prep before we begin potty training. The joke didn't seem so funny to me when I was a kid, however. I remember earning minutes of TV by defining vocabulary words correctly -- while I was still in 4th grade. I remember being rewarded for finishing homework early by getting extra ""Mommy Homework,"" which always involved problem sets and practice exams from a dog-eared stack of Princeton Review test prep tomes. I didn't remember being dressed in a crimson-colored onesie while still an infant, but my mother showed me the one she'd bought for me, proudly pulling it from storage on the day I headed out to college. That's because to my parents, it wasn't enough for me to just go to college. There was only one school they saw as a fitting goal, and it was the reason they came to America, my mother said, hoping that one day they would have kids who would grow up to attend it. That was Harvard University, the only school whose brand name shone brightly enough to reach across the waters to Taiwan. Other schools might offer a more dynamic curriculum, better access to senior faculty, a greater amount of financial aid. None of that mattered. To them, it was Hafu Daxue or bust. As it turns out, I did get into Harvard. And two years later, so did my sister. And her part-time undergraduate job at the Harvard admissions office ended up leading us to a few awkward revelations. You see, in the course of her job, she was able to gain access to college admissions files, and couldn't resist pulling her own to see what it said. The file told her bluntly that she had been a ""marginal"" admit based on her application, but that she was ultimately accepted because she had a brother who was already a student in good standing â€” that is to say, me. Incensed, she then pulled my file to see whether I had gotten in on my own merits. And what she shared with me was the discovery that I essentially would have been denied admission, based on scores and grades that were somewhat lower than hers, and an all-too-typical extracurricular career (piano, math team, blah blah blah). What saved my application was the optional interview I'd done on campus, in which I'd ended up talking about everything that wasn't in my application: My aspirations to be a writer. The horror movie that I'd scripted and shot in secret at our high school. The subtle differences between anxiety, suspense and fear. The fact that I actually really, really suck at piano. The interviewer made the case that I had intangibles that made me a potential asset to the student body, and pressed for me to be considered seriously, despite my middling distinction. Someone decided to take his advice. I hope they didn't end up regretting it. Now, let's go back to Jane Dou. She didn't end up at the center of the Harvard suit accidentally. She was discovered through a broad-based campaign conducted by SFFA founder Edward Blum â€” a frustrated Republican congressional candidate who has chosen to make a career out of waging war on laws and policies that give ""special privileges"" to minorities. Dou was someone Blum wanted -- a student willing to serve as a test case in a high-profile attack on affirmative action. It's important to note that whatever its outcome, the lawsuit won't help Dou. It's almost certain that she's been accepted by other colleges, and by the time the suit is resolved she will likely have graduated from one of them. What this lawsuit is really is just the latest attempt to derail an apparatus that has given hundreds of thousands of blacks, Hispanics and, yes, Asians a means to climb out of circumstances defined by our society's historical racism. It is hardly a coincidence that Blum has chosen to use the Asian American community as his tool to do so. There are millions of Asians who, like my parents, see a prestigious-university education as not just a goal for their children but a virtual entitlement, the product of years of aspiration and preparation. But there are millions of other Asian Americans -- a significant majority, in fact, at 69% -- who support affirmative action as a necessary way for us to achieve a better society, and who recognize that we have benefited and continue to benefit from its fruits, both directly and indirectly. As Loyola University Chicago assistant professor of higher education OiYan Poon puts it, ""The question Asian Americans face now is, 'Do we care about justice or just us?'"" She adds, ""If we care about justice, we have to see that we're only being used as cover to dismantle a policy initiative that is about racial equity, which ultimately benefits everyone."" And then there's the reality that my sister and I experienced personally -- which is that getting into college is about more than just scores. Despite all of my parents' drills and test prep, I was ultimately accepted into Harvard only due to the very ""holistic"" practices that this lawsuit attacks. My sister, meanwhile, was pushed over the line due to her connection to me, a ""secondary legacy"" tie that, based on the research of Harvard University researcher Michael Hurwitz, might have conveyed as much as a 19% boost over other applicants, given her profile. Meanwhile, my kids -- ""primary legacy"" candidates -- will have up to a 50% greater chance of getting in, for no reason other than being born. That's great for them, should they choose to apply to my alma mater, but it's a huge obstacle to overcome for those who don't have that advantage. It amounts to what Richard D. Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, calls ""affirmative action for the rich."" And it locks out the vast majority of blacks, Hispanics and immigrants of every race. Isn't that the real outrage?","A lawsuit was filed against Harvard alleging discrimination against Asian Americans .
Jeff Yang: This lawsuit is not the affirmative action crusade it may seem .
His experience in applying to Harvard suggests a ""holistic"" approach makes sense .
Yang: Don't let this lawsuit derail affirmative action, which has benefited many ."
"Iran's military on Sunday claimed it shot down a U.S. drone into eastern Iran. State media cited a military official who identified the aircraft as an RQ-170 Sentinel. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said a U.S. unarmed reconnaissance aircraft was flying a mission over western Afghanistan -- which borders Iran -- last week when operators lost control. A U.S. official with knowledge of the incident said the crew operating the unmanned drone reported a loss of flight control just before the drone went down. U.S. officials believe the drone Iran is referring to may be the same one, but the U.S. government has not confirmed that it was shot down, the source said. The RQ-170 Sentinel is a stealth drone developed for the Air Force to help provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.  Although the Sentinel was developed for the Air Force, the U.S. official did not say whether it was the U.S. military or the U.S. intelligence community operating the drone at the time of the incident. The official said the drone's mission was to fly over Afghanistan. American officials over the years have been adamant that U.S. assets do not fly over Iranian air space. Iranian media reported that the RQ-170 was slightly damaged and in the hands of Iranian forces. ""Armed forces with a dominant control over the country's borders managed to identify and down the invading plane,"" the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. The unnamed Iranian military official called it a ""clear example of aggression"" and added that Iran is ""fully ready to counter any aggression,"" the report said. In July, Iran's military made a similar claim, saying it downed a U.S. ""spy drone"" flying near its Fordo nuclear enrichment plant in Qom province. But Iran backtracked on the statement a few days later, saying the incident was actually part of a training exercise.","Iran says a ""spy drone"" invaded its airspace and was shot down .

"A celebrity boxing promoter is hoping to capitalize on the alleged nightclub brawl between singer Chris Brown and rapper Drake by offering them $1 million each to take their beef to the ring. The promoter, Damon Feldman, also says he is asking singer Rihanna to be a ring girl at the bout, but acknowledged she'll likely pass. Feldman says he has the financial backing of businessman Alki David and that he'll donate $1 million to a charity that helps abused women if the fight takes place. The fight, he said, would feature three minute-long rounds with the participants donning oversized gloves and protective head gear. Feldman is no stranger to publicity. He has put on fights featuring ex-baseball outfielder Jose Canseco, Lindsay Lohan's dad Michael and Rodney King. Feldman says he has not received a response from either Drake or Brown. And while Drake tweeted about his dry cleaning, and Brown about a helpful stewardess, neither made mention of the offer on their Twitter pages. Meanwhile, police continue their investigation into the bottle-throwing melee allegedly between Drake and Brown and their entourages that took place at the New York City club W.i.P on June 14. Drake brings Club Paradise to Jones Beach . Brown was partying with friends in the VIP section of the South Village club, while the Drake and his friends were nearby, according to statements from reps for both artists. Brown has said he was a victim in the incident, and Drake's representatives have said he ""did not engage in any activity which resulted in injury."" The squabble left Brown with a nasty gash on his chin and fueled Internet rumors that it started because of an argument about Rihanna, the sizzling songstress that both men have dated. A source close to Brown has since told CNN that the confrontation was not about Rihanna. San Antonio Spurs guard Tony Parker was also injured in the scuffle. Parker is suing the nightclub for $20 million over an eye injury he claims he suffered that night. Source: Rihanna argument did not spur Chris Brown fight . The suit alleges that the owners and operators of the nightclub were ""negligent in permitting Drake's entourage and Brown's entourage to be in the club at the same time despite known tension between the two"" and contends the owners failed to provide ""sufficient and efficient security."" Feldman said he wants the boxing match to be in either Las Vegas or Los Angeles. Despite the fact that Brown is on probation until 2014 for pleading guilty to assaulting Rihanna on the eve of the 2009 Grammy Awards, Feldman said he has asked Rihanna to be in the ring carrying a sign that displays the number of the upcoming round. ""I'm 99.9% sure she'll say no. But I can guarantee you, if the fight happens, she will be watching,"" Feldman said. Some have already speculated on who would win a rematch. Rapper 50 Cent told a California radio station he thinks Brown's prowess in dancing would help him beat Drake. ""I would take Chris,"" 50 told KMEL last week. ""I guess it's cause of all the physical things I see him doing with dancing and moving. He be slipping and moving. I don't see Drake doing that. Chris be having his shirt off. He got one of them MMA fighter looks. Like he might have did karate when he was a kid. He's kicking, doing splits and stuff. This could really get interesting.""

"The U.S. House will vote Thursday on holding Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for withholding documents involving the failed Fast and Furious weapons crackdown, Speaker John Boehner said Wednesday. ""We're going to proceed,"" Boehner, R-Ohio, told reporters. ""We've given them ample opportunity to reply."" Late Wednesday, the House Rules Committee approved the procedure for Thursday's debate and vote, which could bring the unprecedented contempt citation of a sitting attorney general. The move came the day after House Republicans rejected the latest offer by the White House and Justice Department to turn over some of the documents sought by congressional investigators. Administration and justice officials met Tuesday with senior aides to Boehner and House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-California, to try to head off the House vote. However, a senior House Republican aide said an offer to let congressional investigators see some of the requested documents in return for dropping the contempt measure was insufficient. A group of House Democrats, led by the Congressional Black Caucus, said it was planning to walk out of the House chamber on Thursday and boycott the vote. In a letter to House members that was still being circulated late Wednesday for signatures, the Democrats opposed to voting on the GOP-sponsored resolutions said, ""Contempt power should be used sparingly, carefully and only in the most egregious situations. The Republican Leadership has articulated no legislative purpose for pursuing this course of action. For these reasons we cannot and will not participate in a vote to hold the Attorney General in contempt."" The letter went on to say the signers would refuse to participate in any vote that ""would tarnish the image of Congress or of an Attorney General who has done nothing but work tirelessly to protect the rights of the American people. We must reflect upon why we are elected to this body and choose now to stand up for justice."" A senior Democratic aide told CNN that, in addition to the Black Caucus, which includes more than 40 members, the Hispanic Caucus, the Asian-Pacific American Caucus, and the Progressive Caucus may also participate.  It was unclear whether any Democratic leaders would join the boycott. The move would mirror a similar walkout by House Republicans in 2008, when Democrats, who then controlled the House, voted to hold two top Bush Administration officials in contempt of Congress. The ranking Democrat on the oversight committee called Wednesday for Boehner to try to work out a solution with Holder instead of holding a vote on Thursday. ""Why are we steamrolling ahead on a matter of such gravity?"" asked Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland. ""In my opinion the answer is plain and simple: politics."" There was no word Wednesday whether Cummings would participate in the planned boycott. In a letter to Boehner, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, asked him to reconsider his decision to bring the contempt citation to the floor. ""Holding the nation's top law-enforcement officer in contempt of Congress would be a drastic, disproportionate action on the part of this body,"" she wrote. Fast and Furious investigation started with agent's death . President Barack Obama has asserted executive privilege on some documents in the dispute, preventing them from being turned over on grounds they include internal deliberations traditionally protected from outside eyes. At Tuesday's meeting, the Justice Department also offered to conduct a briefing, give Congress documents related to whistle-blowers in the case and work with the committee to respond to any questions it may have had after reviewing the materials. ""This was a good-faith effort to try to reach an accommodation while still protecting the institutional prerogatives of the executive branch, often championed by these same Republicans criticizing us right now,"" White House spokesman Eric Schultz told CNN. ""Unfortunately, Republicans have opted for political theater rather than conduct legitimate congressional oversight."" Boehner, however, said Wednesday that a failure to cooperate by the Obama administration had forced House Republicans to take up the contempt measure. Republicans on the House Oversight Committee last week recommended citing Holder. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives launched Operation Fast and Furious out of Arizona to track weapons purchases by Mexican drug cartels. It followed similar programs started in the Bush administration. However, Fast and Furious lost track of more than 1,000 firearms it was tracking in the operation, and two of the lost weapons turned up at the scene of the 2010 killing of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. Issa and Republicans contend that Holder and the Justice Department are concealing details of how Operation Fast and Furious was approved and managed. Democrats argue that Issa and his GOP colleagues are using the issue to try to score political points by discrediting Holder and, by extension, the president in an election year. The showdown between Issa and Holder over the program dates back to subpoenas issued last year by the House committee. At the Rules Committee meeting Wednesday, Issa conceded that investigators lack any evidence that Holder knew of the failed weapons-tracking tactics of Fast and Furious. The contempt citation, he said, was for Holder's failure to comply with subpoenas seeking specific documents. ""It's not for what the attorney general knew about Fast and Furious,"" Issa said. ""It's about the attorney general's refusal to provide the documents."" Issa, White House clash over Fast and Furious executive privilege . Cummings and other Democrats contended that Issa conducted an improper investigation of Holder and Operation Fast and Furious. They complained the chairman refused to let witnesses proposed by Democrats give public testimony and was demanding documents outside the scope of the subpoenas Holder is accused of violating. A video released Tuesday by Democrats on Issa's panel showed the chairman making past allegations of White House links to Fast and Furious, juxtaposed with Issa saying Sunday there was no evidence of a White House cover-up. Some gun rights advocates, including the National Rifle Association, maintain that the program that allowed hundreds of weapons, including assault rifles, to end up in the hands of Mexican drug cartels was a way for the Obama administration to press for new gun-control laws. Issa said Sunday he had e-mails showing the administration planned to point to the operation and push for a ""weapons ban or greater reporting."" However, Cummings pushed back at Issa's claim Tuesday, telling reporters, ""I don't believe that, and I think it's very unfortunate that people are coming up with these theories."" Democratic leaders in the House concede that some Democrats could join with Republicans to hold Holder in contempt, citing pressure from the NRA. ""There's been no polling of our membership on how they will respond to the NRA, but suffice it to say certainly that the NRA is a major force"" in Washington, Rep. John Larson, D-Connecticut, told reporters Wednesday. He predicted the ""strong majority"" of the Democratic caucus would oppose the contempt measure. The committee vote last week was on strict party lines, with Republicans supporting a contempt recommendation and Democrats opposing it. The vote occurred before the gun lobby formally registered its support for the contempt resolution. Rarely has any pro-gun-rights Democrat representing a rural and Southern district broken with the NRA's position on key votes, especially in an election year. ""The reason we support the contempt resolution is the same reason we first called for Attorney General Holder's resignation more than a year ago: the Department's obstruction of congressional oversight of a program that costs lives in support of an anti-gun agenda,"" said a letter to Issa last week from NRA Executive Director Chris Cox. The NRA, which frequently weighs in on congressional races with endorsements and support of a national grassroots network, also warned of electoral consequences for anyone voting against the contempt measure. ""This is an issue of utmost seriousness, and the NRA will consider this vote in our future candidate evaluations,"" the organization said. Opinion: Don't be nosy about Fast and Furious . House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said last week that Republicans were targeting Holder because he is fighting their efforts to suppress voter turnout in November. On Wednesday, Larson chastised Republicans for pushing ahead on the contempt vote as part of a strategy to prevent economic progress and harm Obama's re-election chances in November. ""This is just all part of a continuing plan, and whether it's suppressing the vote or suppressing the economy -- this obstructionist regime that we see that continues to block because they think they would rather see President Obama fail than the nation succeed,"" Larson said. Issa's panel has been seeking documents that show why the Justice Department decided to withdraw as inaccurate the February 2011 letter. However, Holder has refused to turn over materials containing internal deliberations, and asked Obama to assert executive privilege over such documents last week.","""We're going to proceed,"" Speaker Boehner says .

Operation Cross Country 6 took place from Friday through Sunday with more than 2,500 state, local and federal officers working in 57 cities.

Feds break up child porn ring . ""Many times the children that are taken in in these types of criminal activities are children that are dissaffected, they are from broken homes, they may be on the street themselves -- they are really looking for a meal, they are looking for shelter, they are looking for someone to take care of them, and that's really the first approach that's made,"" said Perkins. ""Once the child has been taken out of harm's way, then really the story just begins at that point,"" said Perkins. ""That's where the real work starts, where we have to call upon the community, various social welfare agencies, our own office of victim assistance has to work with each child on an individual basis to see what their requirements are. ""This is a very difficult task. These children are very damaged -- very harmed, and they need a great deal of help -- it's really taxing the social welfare agencies and it's something that, going forward, we need to pay particular attention to."" Even though the FBI says 79 children were rescued, officials said there's no guarantee those minors won't be lured back into prostitution.

""A lot of these kids feel like they are in love, and therefore many of them will go back, so it's not only important that they get help, but they need a specialized kind of help,"" said Ernie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. According to Perkins, the people exploiting children in this manner are engaged in organized crime and have business plans and strategies.  He said such criminals know their market and will move kids from state to state to service clients. The criminals use various methods including the Internet to find vulnerable kids.  They also may find them at bus stations or truck stops and offer them help as a first step to winning their confidence. Operation Cross Country is part of the FBI's Innocence Lost National Initiative which was started in 2003.  With 47 task forces and working groups, the FBI says more than 2,200 children have been pulled off the streets along with more than 1,000 convictions of people exploiting kids. According to the FBI, many of the convictions have resulted in long prison sentences, including eight life terms. Despite those figures, the FBI and child advocates said child prostitution continues to be a serious problem and they called on the public to realize it can happen in any town and neighborhood. Allen said the best estimate is that at least 100,000 American kids get lured into prostitution every year. 2010: Federal crackdown on child prostitution results in 884 arrests .","Operation Cross Country 6 took place from Friday through Sunday .

"A British banker is facing murder charges in Hong Kong over the killing of two women in an upscale apartment in the city's central district of Wan Chai -- where one of the victims was discovered stuffed inside a suitcase on the apartment balcony. The suspect, a 29-year-old man identified as Rurik Jutting, appeared before a magistrates' court in Hong Kong on Monday facing two charges of murder. Wearing black-rimmed glasses, a black t-shirt, and dark jeans, he was not handcuffed and responded ""I do"" when asked by the court clerk if he understood the charges against him. He didn't enter a plea. Authorities said they were called to the highrise apartment in the popular nightlife district of Wan Chai early Saturday morning by the suspect. They first discovered a woman lying inside the residence, identified by local media as a disc jockey at a neighborhood pub who is 25 to 30 years old. She had visible cuts on her body and was pronounced dead at the scene, according to a police statement. Officers then discovered the body of another woman, with wounds on her neck, stuffed inside a suitcase on the apartment's balcony. The second victim was identified as Sumarti Ningsih, according to court documents, which said she had been killed on October 27. Sumarti was a 25-year-old Indonesian woman who entered Hong Kong last month on a tourist visa, according to a report in the South China Morning Post. The other woman wasn't identified. Court documents said she'd been killed on Saturday. When they arrived at the apartment, police discovered a gruesome scene with the residence covered in blood, the newspaper reported. One of the victims was found with ""her throat slashed."" Police said they arrested the suspect after finding a knife at the scene. Court documents gave his occupation as a ""banker"" for Bank of America in Hong Kong. Paul Scanlon, a spokesman for Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong, said that a person named Rurik Jutting had worked there but left the bank recently. He declined to comment further on the case. The British Foreign Office confirmed that a British citizen was arrested in Hong Kong on suspicion of murder, but did not release the name, citing regulations. Autopsies will be performed on the victims to determine the cause of death, authorities said. Jutting didn't apply for bail on Monday. He will remain in jail until his next court appearance on November 10. Such cases are unusual in Hong Kong, which has a low rate of violent crime for a city its size. The upscale apartment building where the bodies were found is described by real estate sites as popular with expatriates for its luxurious facilities, including a heated rooftop swimming pool.

"Washington (CNN)Legislation to approve the Keystone XL pipeline is headed back to Congress after President Barack Obama vetoed the bill Tuesday. Obama's veto of the bill comes after a yearslong debate on the controversial pipeline which ultimately handed a legislative victory to proponents of the pipeline after Republicans took control of the Senate in January. The House and Senate may have come together to send a single piece of legislation to Obama, but don't expect that agreement to lead to construction permits for the pipeline project that would ship crude oil from Canada to U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast. Republicans may have enough Democratic support to clear a filibuster, but they'll be hard-pressed to find the 67 votes to override a veto. So what's the big fuss? Why is this one pipeline such a contentious issue and is it really worth the fight for opponents and advocates of Keystone XL? Let's break it down: . How long would the Keystone XL pipeline be? TransCanada's full-fledged Keystone Pipeline system is waiting for U.S. approval to finish construction on 1,200 miles of pipeline known as Keystone XL -- the final piece of a 3,800-mile pipeline network. Wait. There's already a Keystone pipeline? That's right. Keystone XL represents just under a third of the entire Keystone project, and every other piece of pipe has been built and laid out. In fact, TransCanada's pipeline system is already shipping hundreds of thousands of barrels of crude oil from the Canadian oil sands across the U.S. border -- and into Illinois. The current Keystone XL proposal would run the pipeline through Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas . Oil sands ... that sounds familiar. That's because oil sands are one of environmentalists' biggest gripes over the proposed Keystone XL pipeline since extracting crude oil from the oil sands (oil + sand = oil sands) pumps about 17% more greenhouse gases into the air than standard crude oil extraction, according to a State Department review of the project. And either way, the State Department concluded the oil sands will be developed regardless of whether the pipeline goes through. But that's not all that's prompted environmentalists to protest Keystone XL and deploy an inflatable pipeline on Sen. Mary Landrieu's front yard last November when she was leading the charge to pass the bill. Environmentalists, local residents and indigenous tribes are also protesting the pipeline's planned route, which would cut across the Ogallala Aquifer, which is one of the world's largest. Aqui-what? Aquifer is just a fancy term for an underground layer of porous rock trapping large deposits of water that can often be accessed through wells -- there are about 2,500 within a mile of the would-be Keystone XL route. Aquifers are a key source of fresh water, and environmentalists are concerned the pipeline could pollute those reserves. But the State Department concluded in January -- amid continued objections from environmentalists -- that the impact on water quality ""would be limited."" You said indigenous tribes were also protesting the project? Yes. Native Americans are concerned about the societal impact of camps with thousands of construction workers living near their communities, which face a high rate of sexual assaults from non-indigenous men, representatives of the activist Wica Agli group said in an interview earlier this week. Angus King a 'no' on Keystone XL vote . And the pipeline would also run through the sovereign lands of some tribes. The Rosebud Sioux Tribe even declared that the House bill to approve Keystone XL last week amounted to a declaration of war. War? Sounds serious. If it comes to that, will the economic benefits be worth it at least? Depends what you consider to be ""worth it."" The State Department concluded in January the project would create about 42,000 jobs directly and indirectly during the construction phase (indirect: think commercial benefits for restaurants, shops, etc.). That total includes 3,900 construction jobs to actually build the pipeline. Fact checking Keystone jobs claims . All in all, the pipeline would inject $2 billion in total economic benefits, according to the State Department review. But once the construction -- which would last no more than two years -- wraps up, Keystone XL will have created just 50 permanent jobs -- the number needed to maintain the pipeline. Either way, the State Department's conclusions seriously undercut TransCanada's claims in 2011 that the project would create about 140,000 direct and indirect jobs. So if this pipeline goes through, what are the risks of an oil spill? Not too high. The State Department concluded the Keystone XL proposal ""would include processes, procedures, and systems to prevent, detect, and mitigate potential oil spills."" And will the pipeline help lower gas prices in the U.S.? Not really. The State Department said Keystone XL would have ""little impact"" on domestic gas prices. Alright, so the State Department released its findings on Keystone XL's impact in January. What's the hold up? The State Department concluded its review of the pipeline's impact in January, but was waiting on a Nebraska Supreme Court case over the pipeline's route to determine whether the pipeline project is in the U.S. national interest. That supreme court approved the pipeline's route through the state earlier this month, and the State Department has been reviewing that decision as it makes its final determinations. The State Department said the pipeline was not in the U.S. national interest in 2011, but TransCanada renewed its application in May 2012 after making changes to the proposed route. The State Department concluded in January 2014 that the Keystone XL pipeline would have a negligible impact on the environment . The White House has insisted it will let the State Department's process play it before Obama makes a final decision on whether or not to approve the pipeline. The State Department is expected to conclude its final review soon, once it finishes reviewing comments from various federal agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency, which urged the State Department in a February letter to reconsider the negative environmental impact the pipeline would have. Obama has said his top concern in making a decision will be ""does it contribute to the greenhouse gases that are causing climate change."" For now at least, Obama will veto the Congressional legislation and Keystone XL is facing a dim future. Why Keystone XL matters .","The State Department reported the project would have minimal environmental impacts .
Proponents have touted economic benefits, but the proposal would generate few permanent jobs .
The production of oil from oil sands emits more greenhouse gases ."
"Uruguayan senators voted overwhelmingly in favor of a same-sex marriage measure Tuesday -- a key step that puts the South American nation on the path to becoming the 12th country to approve such a law. Senators approved the marriage equality bill 23-8. Next week, lawmakers in the lower house, which approved a different version of the legislation late last year, are expected to vote on the senate's version. If approved and signed by President Jose Mujica, who has indicated he supports the measure, the proposal would make Uruguay the second country in Latin America to legalize same-sex marriage. Neighboring Argentina legalized such marriages in 2010. It's an issue that's sparked debate and impassioned demonstrations from supporters and opponents in many countries. Legislators in France and the United Kingdom are among lawmakers worldwide weighing proposals to legalize same-sex marriage. In the United States, the question of same-sex marriage went before the Supreme Court last week, and justices are now deliberating over the matter. The first same-sex couples walked down the aisle in the Netherlands in 2001. Since then, almost a dozen countries have passed laws allowing same-sex marriages and domestic partnerships, including Canada, South Africa, Belgium and Spain. In Argentina, the push to legalize same-sex marriage met with fierce opposition from the Roman Catholic Church, with Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio -- then the archbishop of Buenos Aires and now the pope -- engaging in a notorious war of words with the government over the issue. In Uruguay, the church has taken a similar tack, with officials describing the measure as a harsh blow to the institutions of marriage and the family. ""Why make relative or devalue an institution that is already so injured, like the family, introducing deep modifications that are going to confuse more than clarify?"" the Rev. Pablo Galimberti, bishop of Salto, wrote in a recent post on the website of the Uruguayan Bishops Council. Uruguay's Broad Front, a coalition of left-wing political parties, backs the measure. On Tuesday, the group's president stressed that the proposed law change a civil institution and has nothing to do with the church. ""Here we are speaking about RIGHTS, with capital letters. Rights that were denied and repressed for a long time, and which a society that is trying to be modern and inclusive necessarily must recognize, to advance in equality,"" wrote Sen. Monica Xavier. ""Rights that are inherent to people, that are not a legislative creation, but something that the law must recognize."" For years, it was rare to see gay rights issues gaining traction in Latin American countries. Not anymore, Javier Corrales, a professor of political science at Amherst College in Massachusetts, told CNN in 2010. ""Latin America currently has some of the most gay-friendly cities in the developing world,"" said Corrales, who ranked cities' gay-friendliness in a book he co-edited, ""The Politics of Sexuality in Latin America."" In 2009, Uruguay was the first Latin American country to allow same-sex couples to adopt children. It was also one the first Latin American countries to allow same-sex civil unions. The measure approved by Uruguayan senators Tuesday removes the words ""man"" and ""woman"" from the country's civil code and replaces them with the word ""spouse,"" CNN affiliate Teledoce reported.","Measure must be voted on by the lower house, signed by Uruguay's president .

Nine civilians were killed and two others were injured in a bombing in Yala province last month. Muslim separatists in southern Thailand have long battled government forces in a country that is overwhelmingly Buddhist. The conflict came to a head in 2004 after former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra took office. Several thousand people died in the resulting violence.","Police say the explosion caused a fire that burned down about 12 houses .

"(CNN)Luis Figo has entered the race to become FIFA president determined to change an organization he describes as all too often associated with ""scandal."" The former Real Madrid and Barcelona star revealed his intention to run against Sepp Blatter in an exclusive interview with CNN Wednesday. The 42-year-old is renowned the world over after a distinguished 20-year playing career and arguably counts as the most credible threat yet to Blatter's 17-year stranglehold on soccer's top job. Figo was twice voted world player of the year and represented Portugal 127 times, featuring at the World Cup in 2002 and 2006, as well as playing in three European Championships. ""I care about football, so what I'm seeing regarding the image of FIFA -- not only now but in the past years -- I don't like it,"" he told Alex Thomas in Madrid. ""If you search FIFA on the internet you see the first word that comes out: scandal -- not positive words. It's that we have to change first and try to improve the image of FIFA. Football deserves much better than this. ""I've been talking with so many important people in football -- players, managers, president of federations -- and they all think that something has to be done. ""Last year was the World Cup, I was in Brazil and I saw the reaction of all the fans regarding the image of FIFA and I think something has to be changed. ""Change in leadership, governance, transparency and solidarity, so I think it's the moment for that."" Figo joins former Paris Saint-Germain star David Ginola, independent candidate Jerome Champagne, Asian Football Confederation vice-president Prince Ali and Michael van Praag, the head of Dutch football, in the running to become president. The deadline for nominations is Thursday and Figo confirmed to CNN he has secured backing from the five FIFA member associations required to get his name onto the ballot paper for May's election, though he did not name them. His work for Inter Milan and the Portuguese national team also means he satisfies FIFA's rule that states all candidates must have played an active role in association football for two of the five years. He has also been working on UEFA's Football Committee. Figo said the furore over a key report that looked at the bidding process for the 2018 World Cup, awarded to Russia, and the 2022 installment, given to Qatar, had convinced him to stand against Blatter. Soccer's governing body enlisted U.S. lawyer Michael Garcia to probe claims that former FIFA member Mohamed Bin Hammam used a multi-million dollar slush fund to buy support for the bid, charges he and Qatar have strenuously denied. Garcia quit his role as chairman of the Investigatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee after the organization decided not to publish his report, instead releasing a summary by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert -- its independent ethics adjudicator. ""After that report was not published I think that was the moment of change and the moment I thought that something had to be done,"" Figo explained. ""If you are transparent and if you ask for an investigation, a report, which you have nothing to hide, why don't you make public that report? If you have nothing to hide about that, you have to do it. ""[Publishing the report] is the easy thing to do if all the people is doubting what happened. If it came from FIFA to order that report and after that you don't publish, it is not a good decision."" Figo might have the name and the credentials but toppling Blatter could prove his toughest challenge yet. FIFA's president had repeatedly said his current term would be his last but had a rethink at the FIFA congress in June last year -- despite the increasingly turbulent nature of his tenure. The 78-year-old's U-turn drew criticism from a number of federations but his power within the organization was underlined recently when the Asian Football Confederation confirmed its intention to support him even after its own vice-president, Prince Ali, declared his candidacy. But Figo maintains he is unfazed by the scale of his task: ""I think no one is untouchable in this life,"" he said. ""If you think like that you are wrong. ""Of course [Blatter] is a person that is running the organization for so long, since 1998, and a lot of people can be the favorite but I can say for me it is a fantastic challenge to try and convince the people to follow me and support me. ""I have so many examples in football; you can play against the strongest team or you can play against the weakest team and you never know who will win. ""Sometimes you think you will lose and you win, sometimes you think you will win and you lose. That is the beauty of sport. That is the beauty of this running too. It is not easy but you have to believe."" Figo's bid drew immediate support from Chelsea manager and fellow Portuguese Jose Mourinho, who said: ""Figo's candidacy is a great step forward for football. ""His career over many years grants a better future for FIFA. He will be a president focused on football and its general improvement, acting closely with all federations.""","Luis Figo exclusively reveals to CNN he wants to become FIFA president .

"(CNN)It turns out that it isn't just the players who let the tension of the Australian Open get to them. Kim Sears, the fiancee of finalist  Andy Murray, was caught on camera mouthing off -- apparently about his semifinal opponent, Czech player Tomas Berdych. The outburst, which came during Murray's ill-tempered four-set (6-7 (6) 6-0 6-3 7-5) win against Berdych, has been making the rounds. While exactly what Sears said is up for debate, the general consensus is that it was more than a little blue. The match was a tense one from the beginning, with much of the pre-game narrative focusing on Murray's ex-coach, Dani Vallverdu, who is now in Berdych's corner. The Scot, who is not above unleashing a torrent of curse words on court, downplayed his intended's outburst after the victory. ""In the heat of the moment you can say stuff that you regret,"" he said. ""When there's a lot of tension surrounding something, which you created, it's completely normal that the whole first set everyone was tight,"" he told media following the match. ""Even Tomas, who very rarely says anything on the court... there was tension there for him as well."" He added that the tension came at the beginning of the match, and settled down as it progressed. While some Twitter commentators poured opprobrium on the tennis star's significant other, much of the social media reaction downplayed press coverage of Sears' outburst. Murray's opponent dismissed talk of bad blood between him and the Scot, saying he was simply trying to pump himself up after winning the first set. ""I say to myself, 'Well done, Tomas.' That's it,"" Berdych told reporters. ""I think I'm allowed to do that when I win a set."" Murray will play Novak Djokovic in the final on Sunday.

"New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras was sworn in Wednesday as Greece's new prime minister, following months of political uncertainty for the debt-stricken country. He was inaugurated at the presidential mansion after meeting with President Karolos Papoulias, who asked him to form a new Greek government. His swearing-in followed the news that three parties -- the center-right New Democracy, which placed first in Sunday's vote, Pasok and the Democratic Party of the Left -- had reached agreement on the terms for the coalition. The new government is expected to be sworn in Thursday, state broadcaster ERT said. Speaking as he left the presidential mansion, Samaras said: ""We trust that with God's help we will do all we can to get our people out of the crisis. I will ask the government tomorrow morning to work hard in order to be able to give tangible hope to our people."" Greece has been without an elected government for 223 days, and the new government, which has pledged to push for a renegotiation of the painful austerity measures imposed under the terms of an international bailout, will face significant challenges. The country is struggling to get out of the political and financial mire that threatens to drag down Europe's common currency and spark a new global financial crisis. Samaras met with the heads of his two coalition partners, Pasok leader Evangelos Venizelos and Fotis Kouvelis of the Democratic Party of the Left Wednesday evening, ERT reported. Discussions continue on the government's exact makeup, Venizelos said earlier, but it is not expected to include members of the two junior parties in senior Cabinet posts. ""Greece has a government. ... That is the message that we need to send abroad,"" Venizelos said as he announced the deal in a televised statement. The most critical issue for the new government is the formation of a national task force to renegotiate the terms of Greece's unpopular international bailout, he said. Greece will go to a two-day summit in Brussels later this month determined to push fellow European leaders on the issue, he added. Venizelos said it is unfortunate that the anti-austerity party Syriza, which placed second in the election, had declined to join the other parties in seeking the best way forward for the country. New Democracy, which broadly favors Greece meeting international debt obligations, led the talks on forming a coalition after narrowly taking first place in Sunday's election. The socialist Pasok party placed third. What will Greek elections mean for the country's future? Dr. Vassilis Monastiriotis of the Hellenic Observatory at the London School of Economics, said it is a positive step that Greece now has a government, but few details about key appointments or policies are yet known. The Cabinet will be dominated by ministers from New Democracy, after its partners said they would support the government but did not want to be part of it, he said. However, it may include a couple of technocrats from Pasok and a representative from the Democratic Left. Venizelos's focus on the negotiating team that will seek to amend the terms of Greece's bailout deal, rather than the Cabinet, may signal his desire to be part of that team, Monastiriotis noted. An early test for the new government will be the Brussels summit on June 28-29, when it will seek to present a strong front to European leaders as it puts forward proposals on changing the terms of the loan agreement and new investment for growth, he said. While few specifics are known, all three parties are keen to renegotiate a provision under which Greece's current minimum wage of 750 euros a month (about $950) would be cut by 22%, Monastiriotis said. But, he said: ""There's no decision about how (they) actually deal with the immediate problems of acute poverty in parts of society and problems of tax collection."" He predicted that the international community will show patience with the new Greek government at least until September, not least because any alternative would be far more radical and anti-European. And while Samaras has in the past been rather narrow in his views, Monastiriotis said, the politician has shown some leadership in recent days in making concessions to form the coalition. Kouvelis announced Wednesday morning that his party's central committee would back the coalition government but that it wanted efforts made to ease the burden of austerity on the Greek people. ""This support is connected to the political platform that will be decided. The Democratic Left is insisting that this platform will contain commitments that will ensure the removal of measures that have gravely affected the Greek society. The country must have a government, but for us the substance of this government's policy is the big challenge,"" Kouvelis said. The leftist party has supported bailouts from international lenders while seeking to renegotiate the terms. With almost all ballots counted, New Democracy had won nearly 30% of the vote, the Interior Ministry said, giving the party 129 seats in the country's 300-seat Parliament. Syriza, which campaigned against the terms of the bailout, got 71 seats. Pasok, which long dominated Greek politics, won 33. Four smaller parties took fewer than two dozen seats each. A wild election weekend for Greece, France and Egypt . Alexis Tsipras, the fiery leader of the leftist Syriza party, met with Samaras but said Monday he would not back a coalition. ""History and the people will judge them by their results,"" Tsipras said of the parties backing some kind of bailout deal with the creditors who are keeping Greece afloat. ""Shortly we will be vindicated."" He said his party's nearly 27% showing had forced Greek leaders to realize the bailout is ""nonviable,"" and said Syriza would press as a member of the opposition for the bailout to be scrapped in its entirety. The vote was widely seen as a referendum on whether Greece should remain tied to the euro, the currency used by 325 million people across 17 countries in Europe. The possibility of a ""no"" vote roiled world markets, with some analysts warning that the collapse of the euro would cost $1 trillion. The future of Europe: 3 scenarios . International bailouts have kept Greece from defaulting in the face of an ongoing recession and low tax revenue, but lenders have demanded hugely unpopular government budget cuts in exchange. Some observers had predicted that efforts to renegotiate the bailout could lead to a run on Greek banks and deeper misery. The country must identify additional budget cuts by the end of June to be considered compliant with the terms of its bailout. After five years of recession, unemployment is running at about 22%, taxes are going up and many of those with jobs are suffering cuts to wages. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Europe's powerful advocate for balancing budgets to build a strong basis for economic growth, had urged Greeks not to walk away from the international loan deals. ""We will stick to the agreements. That is the basis on which Europe will prosper,"" she said Saturday.","The new government will be sworn in Thursday, Greek state media says .

"(CNN)One daily newspaper in England asked who had the more dazzling engagement ring -- Andy Murray's fiancee or Tomas Berdych's future wife. Call it the Battle of the Bling. But when Murray and Berdych met Thursday for a spot in the final of the Australian Open, it was the Scot who was a cut above his Czech opponent. Murray reached a fourth final in Melbourne when he beat Berdych 6-7 (6) 6-0 6-3 7-5 in an ill-tempered affair, meaning he is on the verge of winning a third grand slam title and first since he ended Britain's nearly 80-year drought at Wimbledon in 2013. Murray complained to chair umpire Pascal Maria about something Berdych said after the first set ended and Berdych didn't appear pleased at Murray's reaction when the 2010 Wimbledon finalist dropped his serve at 5-3 in the first. Television cameras also seemed to show Murray's fiancee, Kim Sears, mouthing an obscenity towards Berdych or his camp -- which included Dani Vallverdu, who used to coach Murray -- during the match. ""When there's a lot of tension surrounding something, which you created, then it's completely normal that the whole first set everyone was tight,"" Murray told reporters, taking a swipe at the media. ""My physical trainer, physio, I'm sure for Dani it was uncomfortable. ""Even Tomas, who very rarely says anything on the court, there was tension there for him, as well. Yeah in the heat of the moment you can say stuff that you regret."" It wouldn't be the first time a player's partner taunted an opponent -- and Roger Federer's wife, Mirka, seemed to do it to defending Australian Open champion Stan Wawrinka at the World Tour Finals in November. Regardless, Berdych downplayed talk of bad blood between him and Murray. He said he was simply trying to pump himself up after winning the first set. ""I say to myself, 'Well done, Tomas.' That's it,"" Berdych told reporters. ""I think I'm allowed to do that when I win a set. ""I pumped myself up ... and that's it, then sit on the chair. I'm not really looking left or right what's going on. I just keep focusing myself and that's it. ""There is no really big deal about anything what was happening today on the court. I mean, it was a great battle. It was a good match. Unfortunately with a bad end for me."" Berdych upset 14-time grand slam champion Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals and he picked up where he left off in the semifinals, using his effortless power to break for 5-3. But after he was broken straight back, things swung in Murray's favor despite Berdych claiming the roughly 80-minute first set. Berdych's intensity dropped and so did his first-serve percentage. Murray, meanwhile, upped his game, stepping up the attack from the baseline and playing his sublime defense when needed. He pointed to his own camp, which featured coach Amelie Mauresmo, when the match ended. ""I got asked all the time about my ex-coach working with Tomas and no one was interested in anything I was doing with Amelie or the way I was playing or anything,"" Murray said. Murray can now sit back and watch Friday's other semifinal between top-seed Novak Djokovic and Wawrinka. Djokovic is attempting to win a fifth Australian Open title. He downed Murray in the 2011 and 2013 finals.","Andy Murray makes a fourth Australian Open final .

"A federal judge has ruled that police in Ferguson, Missouri, violated the Constitution when they told protesters that they had to keep walking and that they couldn't stand still. U.S. District Judge Catherine Perry issued a preliminary injunction Monday forbidding law enforcement from carrying out the practice because ""it is likely that these agencies will again apply this unconstitutional policy."" Law enforcement agencies adopted the policy on August 18, a few days after protests began following the shooting death of unarmed African-American teen Michael Brown at the hands of a white police officer. The case was brought by the ACLU after it saw the strategy being practiced as recently as Setember 27. In some cases, officers told protesters they couldn't stand still for more than five seconds. In others, the protesters were told they were walking too slowly. Ferguson flash mob disrupts St. Louis symphony .

"Hong Kong (CNN)The stunning photo shows a shimmering blue shoreline with the bright lights of Hong Kong in the distance. The fluorescent blue glow is natural lighting powered by an algae bloom of Noctiluca scintillans, commonly known as ""Sea Sparkle."" The non-toxic phytoplankton is not considered harmful and is relatively common in Hong Kong.  What is uncommon is capturing its iridescent glow on camera, which only appears when the water is disturbed. Local photographer Lit Wai Kwong also took an image of the phenomena at Tai Po in Hong Kong's New Territories. ""You can see the blue light if there is a wave, a boat moving, or a stone thrown in the water,"" said Kwong, who used a 30-second exposure to get the shot. ""There was no blue light when the water was calm, therefore many people threw stones into the water in order to see it."" Despite its blue hue, the phenomena is referred to as a red tide and, according to a Hong Kong government website that keeps track of sightings, several have been reported so far this year. Michelle Cheung from the city's Eco-education & Resources Center said the bloom was caused by high pollution in Tolo Harbour, which was exacerbated by the slow flow of currents. She said nutrient levels are typically high in the region, due to restaurant waste and sewage running direct from village houses into the sea. Cheung added that the algae can be deadly because it deprives the water of oxygen, though the government has not recorded any evidence of fish kills. ""Hong Kong and the entire Pearl River Delta has a big problem with wastewater, and that is surely a factor with these plankton blooms,"" said David Baker from the Swire Institute of Marine Science at the University of Hong Kong. He said, by itself, Noctiluca scintillans doesn't represent a threat to human or environmental health, but the huge bloom does represent an ecosystem that's ""out of balance."" ""I guess the analogy is they're like locusts that feed on agricultural crops. And once they find a good abundant food source they will multiply until the food source is exhausted. In Hong Kong unfortunately most of the nutrients are coming from our own sewage."" The damage done to the environment doesn't just happen when oxygen is depleted during the algae's short lifetime. When the blooms die, they sink to the bottom of the sea when they decompose, consuming huge amounts of oxygen. ""That's when we have the formation of these dead zones, where anything that's living, any fish or crab species living on the bottom, is at risk of dying from the low oxygen associated with that decomposition,"" Baker said. Hong Kong has a number of zones that suffer from persistently low levels of oxygen, which ""increase in their severity and their scope whenever we have these algal blooms,"" he added.","Image shows striking blue algae bloom near Hong Kong shoreline .

"Julian likes ornithology and ""Downton Abbey."" He's quite the gentleman, and hates being late for tea. For potential admirers, it's important to note that Julian is a cat. He is one of the stars of New York City's first cat cafe, Meow Parlour, which opened on Monday to much fanfare and a full reservation book. The cats that purr and pounce while patrons sip coffee and nosh on pastries aren't just there for added ambiance -- they're hoping to get adopted. Julian's portrait hangs on the wall with those tongue-in-cheek compatibility stats, alongside other potential matches like Marty, Spot, Squinkles and Lucky Lemon. Their personalities are classified in types like ""bookish"" for the reserved cat or ""cheerleader"" for a more high-energy, friendly one. But being billed as a novelty cat cafe merely scratches the surface, say cafe founders Christina Ha and Emilie Legrand. ""I think we'll feel really like we've made it when we get our first cat adopted,"" Ha said. She and Legrand teamed up with KittyKind, a no-kill, volunteer-run adoption group, in order to uniquely brand their cafe but also give it an altruistic twist. KittyKind currently takes in between 500 and 600 cats a year, with 27 cages in a Manhattan branch of a pet store and a network of foster homes. The duo were inspired by similar concepts in places like Taiwan, France and Japan, but didn't just want to jump on the bandwagon for the sake of pulling the heartstrings of cat lovers to sell more lattes. They wanted to give back by way of ""fur-ever"" homes. Ha rescued two cats, Mr. Socks and Pickle -- the latter from KittyKind -- and decided to partner with the organization after Meow Parlour was a go. ""It brings tears to my eyes to see Lucky Lemon there,"" says Miriam Hibel, who serves on KittyKind's board of directors and is an adoption counselor. Hibel says KittyKind is particularly committed to helping cats with special needs, whether disease, old age or disability. For a cat to be placed in the cafe, it has to have a clean bill of health, get along with other cats and be nonaggressive. She says it's really an opportunity to showcase a cat that might get depressed or hissy in a cage and, therefore, be overlooked by an adopter elsewhere. ""If you're sitting at the cat cafe and you're having a cup of coffee and this beautiful 10-year-old calico cat comes and rubs up against your leg, and you're someone who is open to adopting, you're just as likely to have your heart connect to that cat as Julian, who is 10 months old,"" Hibel says. Ha and Hibel agree that the cafe is a boon for both species. The ultimate goal is that after an afternoon of cat companionship, a patron will want to extend that short-term visit into a lifelong relationship. Hibel says the application process is exactly the same as going through KittyKind's shelter: There's an application, interview, home visit and adoption fee of $125 to cover medical costs. As for the health code regulations relating to animals, Ha worked closely with the Department of Health in the planning stages. There is a separate storefront around the corner, the Meow Parlour Patisserie, where customers can purchase baked goods and beverages to bring into the cafe. And yes, they do have lint rollers.","Meow Parlour, New York City's first cat cafe, is now open .

"(CNN)A previous five-year collaboration led to total domination of Formula One and McLaren chief executive officer Ron Dennis is confident its new partnership with Honda can bring back that winning feeling to the team. Since 1995, McLaren has been using Mercedes-Benz engines, but after two difficult seasons in F1 their new deal with the Japanese car manufacturer renews one of the most successful partnerships in motorsport's elite class. ""The first few races I predict will be problematic, as we wrestle with what we hope are performance advantages, and inevitably performance advantages sometimes carry unreliability with them,"" Dennis told CNN's Amanda Davies in an exclusive interview. ""Once we've got that in control, I think our competitiveness will be quickly established, and I feel when coupled to two world champions, and the talents of Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, I think that the outcome I hope will be inevitable: that we'll return to our winning ways,"" he added. During those halcyon days of domination, McLaren and Honda won 44 out of the 80 grand prix they raced as Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost secured a clean sweep of world titles between 1988 and 1991. It was the type of stranglehold Mercedes had over F1 last season when world champion Lewis Hamilton and teammate Nico Rosberg at times appeared to be only racing against one another. Last year, Mercedes won all but three of the calendar's races, finishing with at least one car on the podium at every single race. While admitting to a ""degree of guesstimate,"" Dennis believes McLaren, which signed a multi-year global partnership with CNN at the start of 2015, are not too far behind Mercedes, the team predicted to once again dominate the new season that gets underway with the Australian Grand Prix on March 15. ""It's unlikely that anybody has surpassed the efforts of Mercedes-Benz. And in sheer horsepower terms we don't really fear the Mercedes-Benz engine,"" added the McLaren boss. For motorsport fans the 1988 McLaren-Honda MP/4 car is one of  F1's most historic pieces of machinery after it won all but one of the 16 races that season. Speaking to CNN ahead of the launch of the team's new car Thursday, Dennis conceded it was unlikely that the new incarnation of the partnership would be able to replicate that level of success, preferring to emphasize that Alonso and Button were key to McLaren's hopes of success. ""The tendency of the regulations at the moment is to put more control back to the driver,"" said the McLaren CEO as he compared F1's pilots to ""automotive musicians."" Dennis added: ""He has to be able to play with these devices and optimize the performance of the car, sometimes even during the lap. ""So driver competence is going to play a very significant role in the future of grand prix racing until there's another regulation change."" But managing two world champions is never easy — as McLaren and Dennis discovered when Alonso left after just one season (2007) with the team due to tensions between the Spaniard and then rookie teammate Hamilton. Before Alonso returned to McLaren for a second spell, Dennis conceded that ""a great amount of time"" was spent talking between the two of them about what had gone on before. ""I have to say it's more about the future than about the past. That as a topic was really about one third of the discussion and it was quickly dealt with. I mean we're older people ..."" While Alonso's seat at McLaren was sorted out ""five or six races before the end of the season,"" Button was left to sweat over his F1 future. Eventually he signed a new deal to extend his four-year stay with the team in December, with his services retained above Kevin Magnussen, who stayed on as a test and reserve driver. ""These drivers had contracts through to the end of 2014 so there's no contractual necessity and I was absolutely open to both drivers about what the process was,"" said Dennis. ""So I can understand the fuss but the fact is we're a business. We're a sport in a business, there's a right time to take the decision, and the right time to take the decision was the time it was taken. If it had been appropriate to take it sooner we would have done.""","McLaren boss Ron Dennis discusses British team's chances for 2015 Formula One season .

"(CNN)These days, failure is in fashion. Books with titles like ""The Wisdom of Failure"" top bestseller lists and there is even a popular annual conference, FailCon, that gathers people together to study past fails. But in spite of all the noise about how it's ok -- nay, productive -- to fail, it can still be a painful and challenging experience. So, what is the best way to bounce back? IMF chief Christine Lagarde, in recent interview with CNN, gave a robust suggestion: ""Oh, get over it. Get over it and move on."" In fact, many women at the top of their fields say that setbacks can be a great source of strength. CNN's Leading Women team were curious to find out how other women recover when things don't go their way, so we asked members of the LinkedIn Connect: Professional Women's Network, powered by Citi for their thoughts. Below is their collected wit and wisdom on the matter. Valuable lessons . Learning was a huge theme, with many variations on the idea that a failure can be a great teacher. Vickie Brock writes that when things go wrong, she tries to look for the lesson so that she doesn't make the same mistake again. She doesn't want ""history repeating itself."" Yvette Scheiber, a business communications expert, leadership adviser and author cautions that failure is ""only a good teacher if you choose to be a good student."" Your failures reveal more than your successes but only if you face them with the desire to better understand yourself, she adds. Paige Bacon, a freelance artist and art educator writes that sometimes the fear of failure can cause you to do just that. ""I failed at my first attempt at self-employment because I was afraid of risk."" Bacon has learned from the experience and wrote that now she takes part in the things that mean the most to her and which might lead in the most interesting directions. A bit of perspective . Gay E Rosen, a real estate broker, takes a philosophical approach to the idea of setbacks. If we aren't ""facing health and life decisions ... aren't our issues of a 'champagne' nature?"" she asks. Rosen's three sons were all born with learning disabilities and says she always encouraged them to play sports to ""strengthen their resolve, endurance and their self-esteem."" All three have gone on to excel at sport, including one who is a two-time Olympian. Linda Jochum-Owczarzak, a researcher at Eastern Michigan University says that a doctor's forthright words helped her when she received a life-threatening diagnosis in 2008. She was at a low ebb, having already lost her job and been through a divorce and an amputation. She remembers: ""I said to my doctor, 'How do I deal with this?' He said, 'It is what it is, no more, no less.'"" ""Those words helped me see my personal responsibility, what was beyond my control define what I valued most and create a plan of action,"" she adds. This too shall pass . Remember, failure doesn't last forever. Scriptwriter and mentor, Karen Fega writes: ""Failure is just temporary ... Success is like a bungee cord, not a long rope. You bounce back."" Airspace manager Sandra Taylor shared a poignant story of achieving her career dream of being an air traffic controller at just 24, losing her job, and spending the next 16 years ""trying to put my life back together."" She worked as a waitress and sold shoes but never gave up hope that she would work in her chosen field again. ""I FOUGHT to get my current position ... and to my knowledge am the only woman to hold that job,"" she says. Her advice is to be resilient, ""make good decisions and never give up ... "" Forgive yourself . Writer Aviva Gittle says that her ""most profound, if not lucrative, comeback was from the real estate bust."" She listed the lessons she had learned, including one that she says she is still learning: ""Forgive yourself."" ""The mistakes are in the past. The money is gone. Use your precious energy to rebuild, not tear down,"" she adds. Marilyn Foreman, a business coach, says that she tends to beat herself up about her failures. But then,""I remember that the only place we learned to link failure with our own sense of value was in school when we were measured, graded and judged on whether we did something right or not."" She finds comfort in the fact that ""there is no link between our value and whether we make a mistake or not."" Fail, fail and fail again. Because if you approach it with the right attitude, failing could be the best thing that ever happened to you. ""What you think of as a 'failure' one year, may well be responsible for a series of actions afterward that leads to an enormous 'win' later,"" writes Barbara Berger, a creative director. ""Nothing is static; as long as you keep moving and remain motivated there will always be a light at the end of a sometimes very long tunnel,"" she adds. Kim Ramsey, an executive coach agrees. ""I have definitely found that adversity is one of the most significant growth and development opportunities assuming the individual takes time to reflect on what was learned. ""As hard as it is to through these difficult times, reassessing and committing to moving forward will make you stronger and is a common characteristic of high potential leaders,"" she writes. Doctor Patricia L McGuire says: ""I have now lived long enough to realize that failure is just part of the game--part, in fact, of the process of success; that the experience of failure is simply to know what will not work, what should not work, or what could not have worked at the time."" She sums it up as: ""Fail Well. Recover. Repeat."" Can failing be good for your career? Insight: The world's richest women . The most inspiring women of the year .","Failing seems to carry less stigma than in the past .
A number of notable people have even championed failure as a learning experience .

"We know Eric Dane is on his way out of Grey's Anatomy, but could McSteamy be joining Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) in that big hospital in the sky? Well, there's no way to say for sure, but things are certainly looking grim in this photo of a rough-looking Mark Sloane, tweeted by Patrick Dempsey. (It was later taken down at ABC's request, per Dempsey.) For the record, Shonda Rhimes told EW earlier this week that viewers should assume nothing about Mark's fate in light of Dane's exit.

"The widow of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said Wednesday she wants his body exhumed to find out whether he was poisoned after tests showed high levels of a radioactive substance on some of his personal belongings. Suha Arafat told CNN she is requesting the body be exhumed ""to make sure 100% of the existence of polonium."" A Swiss doctor said Wednesday they found high levels of toxic polonium-210 on some of Arafat's belongings, though it does not mean he suffered radiation poisoning. ""We have evidence there is too much polonium, but we also have hints from the medical records that this may not be the case,"" said Francois Bochud, director of the Institut de Radiophysique in Lausanne, Switzerland. ""The only way to resolve this anomaly would be by testing the body."" Suha Arafat said she had not made an official request to the Palestinian Authority for exhumation because no official request is needed. The Palestinian Authority said Wednesday that it would not object to exhuming the body from its tomb if Arafat's family approves. Arafat belongings test high for radioactivity, scientist says . If it turns out that Arafat, who died in 2004, was poisoned, ""Any result will be significant for us to help know the truth,"" said Suha Arafat, the former leader's widow. ""It is a form of closure for our family. Closing one wound but opening a new one, wondering who is responsible."" Bochud's research team tested Arafat's toothbrush, clothing and keffiyeh, the trademark black-and-white headscarf he often wore, Bochud said. But getting data from items like clothing ""is really tricky business,"" said Cham Dallas, a professor and toxicologist at the University of Georgia's Institute for Health Management and Mass Destruction Defense. ""We don't have enough information to make any definitive statement, but it does seem a bit of a stretch"" to conclude that Arafat was poisoned by polonium-210, he told CNN in a telephone interview. Dallas questioned how much confidence the Swiss scientists could have in their measurements and said he was looking forward to results from tests carried out on the body after it is exhumed. ""I'd have a lot more confidence if you could give me a bone sample,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. He cited compartments inside the bone as particularly telling. ""There's old bone and then there's new bone,"" he said. ""If you're sampling, it would come out very differently."" Arafat died at age 75 at a Paris military hospital after he suffered a brain hemorrhage and slipped into a coma. Palestinian officials said in the days before his death that Arafat had a blood disorder -- though they ruled out leukemia -- and that he had digestive problems. Rumors of poisoning circulated at the time, but Palestinian officials denied them, and then-Foreign Minister Nabil Sha'ath said he ""totally"" ruled them out. Two weeks after Arafat's death, his nephew said medical records showed no cause of death. Nasser al-Kidwa, who was the Palestinian observer to the United Nations, said toxicology tests showed ""no known poison"" -- though he refused to exclude the possibility that poison caused his uncle's death. ""The suspicion that he was killed, that he was deliberately murdered, has been there all along and most Palestinians believe that,"" said Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestinian Liberation Organization's executive committee. ""I personally believed it because I was with him; I saw him; I saw the transformation and it certainly was unnatural."" Ashrawi said she had spoken with Arafat's doctors, who told her that they could not rule out the possibility that he had been poisoned. ""But we didn't have any kind of thread, any kind of evidence,"" she told CNN. ""This report, in many ways, tells us our suspicions are founded that there is sufficient evidence to say that he was killed, that he was assassinated using polonium."" Only a few countries, including the United States, Israel and Russia, have stocks of polonium-210, a fact that would limit the list of possible suspects, he said. ""You would only use polonium if you were making a statement, not if you were trying to hide,"" he said. Someone trying to get away with murder would be better off using pharmaceutical agents, since a number of of them ""disappear in the body"" and cannot be identified later, he said. ""I can't figure out why they would use it, frankly,"" he said. ""There are so many really cool agents to kill people if you want to be secret and even if you want to make a statement."" Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has ordered a committee investigating Arafat's death to follow up on all reports ""and to seek assistance from Arab and international experts to find the truth behind Arafat's illness and death,"" said his spokesman, Nabil Abu Rudeineh. It should be possible to detect any remaining polonium -- a naturally radioactive chemical element -- in Arafat's body, despite the time that has elapsed since his death because he was buried in a tomb, not underground, Bochud said. Arafat's widow asked the Swiss institute to analyze some of his belongings and medical documents, Bochud said. The Qatar-based satellite network Al Jazeera relayed the request and broadcast a report about the test results. The testing found no evidence of traditional poison, Bochud said. But Al Jazeera and the family then asked him to test for radioactive material, and found an ""unexplained amount of polonium-210,"" he said, adding, ""We are testing tiny quantities so it is difficult to measure and not conclusive."" A body fluid stain contained 180 megabecquerels per liter of the radioactive isotope, while a typical sample would contain 5 megabecquerels per liter, Bochud said. A becquerel is a unit of measurement of radioactivity. The fabric of Arafat's clothing, without body fluid, contained less than 10 megabecquerels per liter, Bochud said. Tests involving biological samples -- such as urine, sweat or blood -- contained higher levels than other samples taken from his clothing, he said. Arafat's widow had left his clothes inside a sports bag from the time they were returned to her eight years ago from the hospital, Bochud said. It was not clear whether anything that may have happened to the clothes -- over the years or in the testing process -- may have affected the test results. Asked whether polonium-210 could have been applied to the items since Arafat's death, Bochud said, ""Anything is possible."" Bochud also said the Institut de Radiophysique did not verify that the clothing was Arafat's; another organization concluded that the DNA on the items was similar to that of Arafat's daughter. Zahwa Arafat provided her DNA for the comparison, Suha Arafat told CNN. The wait for test results, which lasted months, ""was emotionally difficult,"" she said. Former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko died of polonium poisoning in London in 2006. But it's hard to compare the cases of Arafat and Litvinenko, who was diagnosed when he was alive, Bochud said. Arafat's symptoms when he died were not entirely consistent with polonium poisoning, he said. ""For example, the bone marrow stayed in good shape until (the) death of Arafat. In other cases of polonium poisoning there is a decaying of the bone marrow,"" the medical expert said. ""Another point, he did not lose his hair as would be expected in the case of polonium."" poisoning. Scientists performed more than 50 measurements on the belongings between February and June, he said.","A stain contained higher levels of polonium-210 than a typical sample, a scientist says .
The test results do not necessarily mean Arafat was poisoned, the scientist says .
""There is sufficient evidence"" Yasser Arafat was killed, PLO official says .
Use of polonium-210 as a poison ""does seem a bit of a stretch,"" toxicologist says ."
"Three days after he was killed, CNN found a journal belonging to late U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. The journal was found on the floor of the largely unsecured consulate compound where he was fatally wounded. CNN notified Stevens' family about the journal within hours after it was discovered and at the family's request provided it to them via a third party. The journal consists of just seven pages of handwriting in a hard-bound book. For CNN, the ambassador's writings served as tips about the situation in Libya, and in Benghazi in particular. CNN took the newsworthy tips and corroborated them with other sources. A source familiar with Stevens' thinking told CNN earlier this week that, in the months leading up to his death, the late ambassador worried about what he called the security threats in Benghazi and a rise in Islamic extremism. Stevens died on September 11, along with three other Americans, when the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi came under attack amid a large protest about a U.S.-made film that mocked the Muslim Prophet Mohammed. The California-born Stevens joined the Peace Corps and attended law school before joining the Foreign Service, the career diplomatic corps, in 1991, according to his State Department biography. He spent most of his career in the Middle East and North Africa, including postings to Israel, Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia, in addition to serving as the deputy chief of the U.S. mission to Libya from 2007 to 2009, during the rule of Moammar Gadhafi, according to the State Department. In May, one year after arriving aboard a cargo ship to work with those involved in the upstart rebellion, Stevens was appointed U.S. ambassador to Libya.","U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens was killed in a September 11 attack in Benghazi .

"It's a powerful thing: the airline window seat. Kids clamor for them. Shutterbugs are drawn to them. And some of us can't not look out the window. See iReporters' window seat photos . Statistics suggest that window seat passengers may enjoy their flights more. But changes are afoot for this travel touchstone. Some of the most desirable window seats come at a premium now. And that may shift how we feel about them. And let's face it, if all the photos snapped from airplane windows are any indication, we LOVE them. Why all the love? Sure, the stunning 30,000-foot views are cool. But for some travelers, it's deeper than that. Really? Can you analyze a traveler's personality by their favorite airplane seat? Of course not; don't be ridiculous. But let's do it anyway. First, let's take a look at the aisle seaters, who are passionate in their own right about airline seating. Screw the view; these folks are all business. ""The aisle person is looking to get some work done,"" said Courtney Scott, Travelocity's travel blogger. They want quick access to the cabin door -- or the restroom. And to get that access, they're willing to put up with collisions with passing airline attendants and rattling snack carts. Aisle seaters sacrifice frequently standing up and sitting down -- and returning their ""folding trays to their full upright position"" -- to make way for the middle and window seaters. For window seaters, it's not just about the view (or something to lean on). It's about the experience! These fliers often are the true romantics. Need proof? Search #windowseat on Twitter and you'll find plenty of tweeters waxing about windows. Like Bouss'n.Like.A.Bouss: . Tweeting travelers have a lot of love for Erykah Badu's 2010 hit song ""Window Seat."" You'll find Tweeters singing it -- virtually -- online. ""Can I get a win-dow seat? Don't want nobody ... next to me,"" the lyrics read. ""I just wanna ticket outta town ... a look around ... and a safe touch down. I just wanna chance to fly ... a chance to cry ... and a long bye-bye."" When it comes to heart-wrenching separations, the aisle seat just doesn't pack the same cinematic punch. It's been a century since the first U.S. commercial airline took to the sky. In that time, the window seat has become for many the best part of flying in an industry where complaints are all too frequent and the novelty of flight has faded. It attracts certain kinds of travelers, but it also can transform them. ""It's a calmer seat,"" Scott says. Stats on airline seats are hard to come by, but anecdotally, front aisle seats are ""generally considered most desirable"" among Travelocity customers, Scott says. At Expedia, 21% of customers over the past year picked window seats, 20% chose the aisle, and the rest had no preference. A United Airlines satisfaction survey for Airbus A320 passengers showed slightly higher preference for windows over aisles. The consumer data collection site Hunch.com reports nearly seven out of 10 respondents prefer windows. ""Window choosers are more likely to be younger, female, shorter and more casual than their aisle compatriots,"" Hunch wrote. ""They're also more likely to be into nature."" Here's what's changing: Airlines are charging premium prices for some window and aisle seats. And that's forcing passengers to choose the dreaded middle seat. It also makes it more difficult for families to sit in the same row if they're not willing to pay extra. Airlines with preferred seating fees include American, Spirit, Frontier, US Airways, Allegiant, Ryan Air and Delta. Charging more for preferred seating offers passengers more seating choices and flexibility, Delta said in June. This is shifting ""the way that people view the window seat,"" Scott said. ""It has become even more of a premium."" Fliers stung by window, aisle fees . It's not all blue skies with the window seats. The American College of Chest Physicians issued new health guidelines this year warning that sitting in window seats on long-distance flights can increase some people's risk of developing life-threatening blood clots called deep vein thrombosis. Combine that with a higher risk of wetting yourself and stepping on strangers' toes, and you can see how far passengers are willing to go for those killer views. Guidelines dispute ""economy class syndrome"" And of course, who better to ask about the best air views than airline pilots? They tell us that -- generally -- window seaters love flying in and out of New York LaGuardia; Vancouver, British Columbia; Sydney; Hong Kong and San Francisco. Washington's Reagan National Airport has an eye-popping approach known to pilots as ""river visual,"" says pilot Justin Schlechter. The plane flies low over the Potomac, giving passengers on the left side amazing views of the Kennedy Center, the Lincoln Memorial and the National Mall. The descent into Anchorage, Alaska, Schlechter says, ""is spectacular, with unbelievable mountaintops just skimming below the aircraft."" Best seats: right side. And then there's the constant reminder that you're in a metal tube at 30,000 feet. In a famous 1963 episode of ""The Twilight Zone,"" William Shatner plays a mentally disturbed flier who watches helplessly through the window while a gremlin tears the plane apart. ""It taps into that universal thought of 'if God intended us to fly, we would have wings,' "" the ""Star Trek"" star told Business Jet Traveler. ""A lot of people getting on an airplane to this day still can't figure out why it flies."" Watch a two-minute version of ""The Twilight Zone"" episode . Window psychology factored into Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner, says John Barratt, CEO of the Teague design firm. Barratt told Fortune magazine that designers wanted to ""bring some romance back"" to air travel by reconnecting passengers ""to actually flying."" Result: bigger windows. Dreamliner windows measure 19 inches tall, 65% larger than the industry standard, according to Boeing. The cool factor on these portals is high: a gel inside the glass allows passengers to brighten or darken the outside sunlight with the touch of a button. Finally, a word of advice from award-winning travel blogger Geraldine DeRuiter of Everywhereist.com: Don't be the ""inconsiderate window seat guy."" If sunlight is burning through your window when many passengers are trying to sleep, please shut your shade. Otherwise, DeRuiter writes, you'll be called out as ""heinous and rotten and selfish."" And you don't want that -- no matter how amazing your view is. So... which airplane seat do you prefer? Why? What does your choice say about your personality? Should airlines charge fees to book preferred window seats? We're interested in your opinions and experiences.

"(CNN)The world's richest club Real Madrid has come out fighting over football's world governing body's investigation into the club's youth transfer policy. Barcelona has already been hit with a transfer ban after breaching regulations when signing young players, but rival Real insists it has complied fully with FIFA's rules when conducting its own under-age deals. Real said it has shown ""extraordinary diligence"" during the transfer and registration of the 51 cases of foreign minors that are being investigated. The Spanish club issued a lengthy statement confirming the governing body's request for documents relating to the various deals taking place over the last five years, though it did not name any of the players. ""Real Madrid defends the protection and the correct and healthy development of minors via its strict adherence, without exceptions, to the Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players, and is in complete agreement with such investigations being carried out to this end,"" the statement read. Article 19 of FIFA's regulations prohibits the transfer of players under the age of 18, unless they meet one of three qualifying criteria. Under-age players can move to a club in a different country if their parents move there for non-footballing reasons, if they are from another nation within the European Union or European Economic Area and aged between 16 and 18, or if they live within 100km of the club. Real provided explanations for each of the 51 cases, stating that the majority of players were exempt from regulations for various different reasons. Among the exemptions it provided were that 10 players were Spanish nationals, 23 foreign players had previously been registered with other Spanish clubs, six players were 18 or over at the time of their registration, two players had never belonged to Madrid and one player appeared twice on FIFA's list. Real also offered up further explanations for the remaining nine cases. ""Real Madrid has responded diligently, supplying all the information required by the Committee within the established deadlines and in complete documentary detail,"" added the Real statement. ""Both Real Madrid and the RFEF [Royal Spanish Football Federation], through which the informative investigation is being processed, have been left totally satisfied with the information supplied and have verified the strict adherence to the registration regulations in absolutely every case."" Madrid director Emilio Butragueno had earlier confirmed Monday that FIFA is investigating the club, but is confident there is nothing to worry about. ""We are in agreement with FIFA in this matter and we will continue collaborating with them in everything that is asked of us,"" he told reporters. ""We are absolutely calm about how Real Madrid has proceeded."" Madrid, who sit top of the Spanish La Liga, completed the signing last week of 16-year-old Norway international Martin Odegaard from Norwegian club Stromsgodset.","Real Madrid confirms FIFA investigating club over 51 under-age transfers .

"The overthrow of Moammar Gadhafi has had a messy and often confused aftermath, as rival groups jostle for a stake in the new Libya after four decades of dictatorship. But while the realities of Libya's new order remain murky, for the country's Berber minority, the task ahead is clear. The removal of the old regime has cleared the way for a renaissance of their ancient language and culture that were brutally suppressed under Gadhafi's hardline rule. Known in their native tongue as Amazigh, or ""free man,"" the Berbers are the indigenous inhabitants of North Africa, whose culture  predominated in the region prior to the 7th century Arab invasion. But Gadhafi's ideology stressed the unity of all Libyans under an Arab identity, and any efforts at Amazigh cultural expression during his rule were effectively forbidden. Those among the country's Berber minority -- there is no reliable census data, but most estimates place it at about 10% of the population -- who attempted to promote their rights or cultural heritage would find themselves persecuted, sometimes even killed. Berbers were unable to publicly speak or publish books in their language, Tamazight, or display symbols such as the Amazigh flag. ""You couldn't teach it in schools, you didn't have university departments for Amazigh research, or have Amazigh TV stations or radio,"" said Mazigh Buzakhar, a Tripoli-based Berber activist. ""Even children's names -- there was a law which banned any names that were not Arabic or Islamic. They (the Gadhafi regime) forced you to change your child's name."" Buzakhar has personally felt the brunt of the regime's hostility to Berber culture. In December 2010, prior to the revolution, he and his twin brother were arrested in their Tripoli home, on suspicion of ""working and collaborating with foreign intelligence."" Their real crime, according to Buzakhar and Amnesty International, was advocating for Berber cultural rights, evidence of which was found by police in the form of banned Amazigh texts, smuggled from abroad, in their home.

The pair was held for months in a cell designated for prisoners facing life sentences or execution, where Buzakhar said his brother was blindfolded and kicked by guards, when in February the revolution began. A riot erupted at the prison and, along with other prisoners, the brothers escaped. ""We were very lucky,"" said Buzakhar. Having escaped from prison, Buzakhar headed for the Nafusa Mountains, a traditional Amazigh stronghold where the Berber population would become heavily engaged in fighting with Gadhafi's forces, gaining the upper hand more swiftly than their counterparts in the east of the country. Buzakhar started a media communications center, and set about producing the first ever journal published in Tamazight. Initially a crudely produced newsletter, printed on sheets of A4, ""Tilelli"" (""Freedom"" in Tamazight) became a more professional publication when Buzakhar relocated to the capital following the fall of Tripoli. Written in Tamazight, Arabic and English, it has a print run of 3,000, and a focus on promoting Amazigh culture and language, by reprinting ancient works of poetry, as well as more modern works by writers such as Said Sifaw al-Mahrouk. ""Tilelli"" is just one element of the flowering of Amazigh culture to have taken place in the wake of Gadhafi's downfall. Tamazight is being taught by cultural associations, can be heard on radio stations, and read on signs written in the Tifinagh alphabet at shops and other public places. The Berber flag -- comprised of blue, green and yellow horizontal stripes, superimposed with a red Tifinagh character symbolizing a ""free man"" -- is displayed proudly, and Amazigh music is performed at festivals around the country. ""After 40 years of having a complete lack of this kind of expression, there's a real enthusiasm for it,"" said Diana Eltahawy, Amnesty International's North Africa researcher. ""What we see is the Amazigh gathering together and celebrating their culture, having various festivals, making links between towns. They're filling up the space they were denied for several decades."" But despite their new-found freedom of cultural expression, some Berber activists remain anxious about their community's position in the new Libya. When an interim government was announced in November without a single Amazigh minister, Berbers reacted with disappointment. Fearing their community was being marginalized, a group calling itself the Libyan Amazigh Congress announced it was suspending all relations with the National Transitional Council (NTC). Read also: Syrian artists fight Assad regime with satire . Many Berbers were frustrated by the sense that their strong military contributions in overthrowing Gadhafi -- Juan Cole, a history professor at the University of Michigan, labeled them ""among the central Libyan heroes of the revolution"" -- had gone unrewarded, said Buzakhar. ""They used us to progress and make a progress in advance to get Libya liberated,"" Buzakhar said. ""But once things were liberated, the message has been: 'Thank you so much, we used you and that's it.' To us, it's like a betrayal by the NTC."" In this climate, some Berbers fear their cultural rights may not receive the constitutional protections they seek. Libya's interim ""constitutional declaration,"" drawn up by the NTC to provide a framework for the transition to an elected government, pledged that the state would protect the linguistic and cultural rights of ""all components"" of Libyan society. But while upholding Arabic as the official language, the declaration stated that Libya's other languages ""shall be deemed national ones"" -- falling short of the level of recognition sought by Berber activists. Buzakhar said Tamazight's ""deep-rooted"" history as a native language -- which significantly predated Arabic's arrival in North Africa -- meant that regarding it as anything less than an official language was illogical. Berbers wanted Libya's new leaders to accord Tamazight a similar status to that which it held in Morocco, where it is estimated more than half of the country's 32 million people speak Berber dialects. In 2011, Tamazight became an official language in Morocco, taught alongside Arabic in schools. But it remains to be seen what provisions would be contained in the new constitution, to be drafted by a committee chosen by the  newly elected congress, said Eltahawy. Any broader recognition of Libyan Amazigh cultural rights would require overcoming greater barriers than the legacy of Gadhafi's suppression and scapegoating, said Buzakhar. ""Our problem is not only the 42 years of the former regime. Our problem is 1,400 years of Arab or Islamist mentality that has been brought to North Africa itself. It's a mentality problem, not only with the common people but in the heads of the politicians."" He said although there were generally good relations between Libyan Arabs and Berbers, their rejection of pan-Arabist ideology and insistence on a distinct Amazigh identity made them a continued target for criticism. Some political leaders were still inclined to emulate Gaddafi by casting suspicion on the Berber community for personal gain. But Buzakhar said although Libya's Amazigh renaissance did not enjoy the state support exhibited in Morocco and Algeria, he was optimistic the Berber culture would continue to flourish. ""What's different from Algeria and Morocco is that the consciousness of the Amazigh people is stronger in Libya, because we've paid the price,"" he said. ""We have had martyrs who gave their lives to preserve their language, and ensure they are part of the political environment of the new Libya for generations to come.""

"Leonardo da Vinci painted an earlier version of his famed masterpiece ""Mona Lisa,"" claims a private Swiss art foundation dedicated solely to the alternate painting, which it unveiled Thursday. But an expert on da Vinci in Britain says there is evidence that the Renaissance master may not have been behind the picture presented as the ""Earlier Mona Lisa"" but known more commonly as the ""Isleworth Mona Lisa."" The Mona Lisa Foundation, based in Zurich, offers a wealth of documentation to support its argument that the painting it represents is a predecessor -- from the master's own hand -- to the world's most famous portrait hanging in the Louvre Museum in Paris. Martin Kemp, professor emeritus at Oxford University, who has examined the arguments, says the ""reliable primary evidence provides no basis for thinking that there was 'an earlier' portrait of Lisa del Giocondo."" Da Vinci's lost masterpiece may be found . In addition to a 320-page art book titled ""Mona Lisa: Leonardo's Earlier Version,"" the foundation's website makes its case using visual widgets of painstaking side-by-side comparisons of the ""Isleworth"" with ""Mona Lisa,"" magnifying their similarities down to the small details. The obvious resemblance, easily visible to the untrained eye, could be evidence that the work is just another copy of the portrait of Lisa del Giocondo that was painted after da Vinci's masterpiece was completed -- and probably by someone else, Kemp said in a news release. The ""Mona Lisa"" that millions of art lovers flock to gaze upon behind its protective case in the Paris museum was altered from a previous state. ""The Isleworth picture follows the final state of the Louvre painting,"" Kemp said. ""It does not therefore precede the Louvre painting."" The foundation and Kemp also disagree on the results of modern technical examinations of the ""Isleworth,"" which the foundation has invested in. ""The images produced by infrared reflectography and X-ray are not at all characteristic (of) what lies below Leonardo's autograph paintings,"" Kemp says. Museum displays earliest known Mona Lisa copy . The Mona Lisa Foundation presents historical notations by artists and intellectuals in the 16th century and beyond to back up the possible existence of a second portrait, but Kemp finds it inconclusive. In a 20-minute art history video, its own in-house expert Stanley Feldman, main author of the book, presents the foundation's detailed arguments. The video also includes sound bites from the director of an Italian museum dedicated to Leonardo da Vinci. ""I believe it is more than possible that there existed two pieces of art,"" said professor Alessandro Vezzosi, director of the Museo Ideale Leonardo da Vinci, pointing to features that could tie the painting to historical references to an earlier work of art. What the brain draws from: Art and how we see it . But Vezzosi does not say directly that he believes the ""Isleworth"" is the predecessor of the world-renowned coyly grinning ""Gioconda."" In a speech in Geneva on Thursday, Vezzosi again hedged his bets, not backing the foundation's claim outright but saying it had presented a ""fascinating possibility"" that merited further study. ""The 'Isleworth Mona Lisa' is an important work of art deserving respect and strong consideration as well as a scientific, historic and artistic debate among specialists rather than a purely media interest,"" he said. He is conducting parallel research in conjunction with another expert, Carlo Pedretti of the Armand Hammer Center for Leonardo Studies of the University of California in Los Angeles, Vezzosi said. Meanwhile, Kemp recommends ""that questions are asked about the relationship of the Foundation to the current owners."" The Swiss nonprofit was established by bank chairman Markus Frey, financier Daniel Kohler and auctioneer David Feldman, who shares his last name and hometown of Dublin with the foundation's art historian. It does not divulge who owns the ""Isleworth"" on its website but explains that ""the owners of the painting have endowed The Mona Lisa Foundation with exclusive rights to carry out its objectives."" If the ""Isleworth"" is not a da Vinci original, as the foundation claims, but a copy, which Kemp thinks is more likely, then it's not a great one, he says. It doesn't quite have that Mona Lisa smile. Scientists unlock secret of Mona Lisa's face .","A Leonardo da Vinci expert says the claim is worth further research .

"It has been more than 1,000 days since a Christian pastor was thrown into an Iranian jail for leaving Islam and sentenced to death for, as the U.S. State Department put it, ""simply following his faith."" On Monday, the agency once again called on Iran to release Youcef Nadarkhani. ""Pastor Nadarkhani still faces the threat of execution for simply following his faith, and we repeat our call for Iranian authorities to release him immediately,"" said a statement from State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. His next scheduled court date is September 8. Nadarkhani, born to Muslim parents in the northern Iranian town of Rasht, converted to Christianity when he was 19. Later he was ordained as a minister and led a network of house churches in Iran. He was arrested in October 2009 after he lodged a protest with local education officials after learning his child was being forced to read from the Quran, the Muslim holy book, in school. He was charged with apostasy and convicted in a provincial court -- which sentenced him to death. He appealed, and during a trial in a lower court, refused to recant his beliefs. The case made its way to the Supreme Court, which said Nadarkhani's sentence could be overturned if he recanted. The 34-year-old pastor has refused. Even though the constitution of Iran -- a predominantly Shiite Muslim country -- guarantees equality to members of religious minorities, that has not been the case in practice. And while apostasy is not an offense codified in Iranian law, converts from Islam often face the death penalty, Amnesty International said. Persecution has increased since Iran's disputed presidential election in 2009, with Baha'is, Christian converts and even Sunni Muslims bearing the brunt. In April 2010, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom reported a rise in church raids and harassment of worshippers by Iranian authorities. And Amnesty International, in a report released earlier this year, said ""repeated calls by the Supreme Leader and other authorities to combat ""false beliefs"" -- apparently an allusion to evangelical Christianity, Baha'ism and Sufism -- appear to have led to an increase in religious persecution."" In February, the White House issued a pointed statement in the Nadarkhani case, strongly condemning the reports of an execution order. ""This action is yet another shocking breach of Iran's international obligations, its own constitution, and stated religious values,"" the statement said. ""The United States stands in solidarity with Pastor Nadarkhani, his family, and all those who seek to practice their religion without fear of persecution -- a fundamental and universal human right. "" From small churches to large organizations, Nadarkhani's case has galvanized American Christians. The Voice of the Martyrs, an organization that monitors and attempts to assist with persecuted and minority churches around the world, has closely followed Nadarkhani's case and other developments involving Christians in Iran. But the issue has not been solely spearheaded by Christian groups; Muslim organizations have also been vocal about condemning Iran. ""These types of cases, especially around apostasy, are too frequent occurrences in the Muslim world and as a Muslim, I am appalled,"" said Harris Zafar, national spokesman for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. ""To do this in the name of Islam, I know that this isn't Islam. It is a violation of human rights and it is a violation of Islam."" The American Center for Law and Justice -- a group ""specifically dedicated to the ideal that religious freedom and freedom of speech are inalienable, God-given rights"" -- was asked by the pastor's lawyers  last year to help publicize Nadarkhani's case, according to Jodran Sekulow, executive director of the group. Since that time, Sekulow has been in somewhat regular contact with the pastor's legal team and the ACLJ have organized a Twitter campaign called ""Tweet for Youcef."" The group says the campaign is now reaching more than 2.5 million Twitter accounts in 234 countries and territories around the globe each day. In March, the U.S. House of Representatives passed on a 417-1 vote a resolution condemning Iran for imprisoning Nadarkhani, while calling for his immediate release. In a letter posted May 30 on Voice of the Martyrs website, Nadarkhani seemed a bit taken aback by all the attention his case was garnering and by those using it for political purposes. ""I want to appreciate all those (who) are trying to reach this goal,"" he said.  ""At the end I hope my freedom will be prepared as soon as possible ...""","Youcef Nadarkhani's next scheduled court date is September 8 .

"(CNN)Algeria and Ghana are through to the quarterfinals of the 2015 African Cup of Nations at the expense of Senegal and South Africa after a dramatic conclusion to the competition's ""Group of Death"" Tuesday. All four teams had a chance of qualifying before kick-off with Senegal requiring just a point to be sure of their passage to the next stage. However, a 2-0 defeat at the hands of Algeria coupled with Ghana's late 2-1 win over South Africa ensured Alan Girese's men would not be progressing from Group C. Playing an unimaginative brand of long ball football and with little shape in attack or defense, Senegal's demise seldom looked in doubt in Malabo . Algeria had the chance to open the scoring after just 90 seconds but a terrible touch from Sofiane Feghouli when through on goal allowed Senegal goalkeeper Bouna Coundoul to smother. The pre-tournament favourite would not have to wait long to break the deadlock, however. Aided by some lackadaisical defending, Riyad Mahrez controlled a simple ball over the top before composing himself and calmly slotting beyond Coundoul. Algeria was dominant and Hillal Soudani took his turn to test Coundoul with a rasping shot from distance after 20 minutes. Girese had warned his players before the game that nothing was settled despite their advantage atop the group. And as the half wore on the Frenchman's side began to edge their way into the contest. Idrissa Gueye stung the palms of Rais Mboli in the Algeria goal with a long range effort as halftime approached. Yet Senegal looked vulnerable on the break when pushing forward. This pattern would come to define much of the second half. Senegal brought on Newcastle striker Papiss Cisse as they searched for an equalizer and they made early headway as Sadio Mane almost latched on to a Papy Djilobodji cutback. Algeria withstood this early pressure and came close to doubling their advantage after 73 minutes. Saphir Taïder's strike from the edge of the area beat Coundoul but not Kara Mbodji who had fallen back to station himself on the line. Ten minutes later though there was nothing Coundoul or his defenders could do as Nabil Bentaleb found himself free on the edge of the Senegal area. The Tottenham midfielder composed himself and fired an unstoppable shot into the bottom right hand corner to make sure of the victory and top spot in the group. Algeria's triumph meant Ghana required a win over South Africa in Mongomo to leapfrog Senegal in the standings and book their place in the quarterfinals. But things didn't start too brightly for the Black Stars as Mandla Masango broke the deadlock for South Africa with a stunning volley after 15 minutes. Aware that two goals were required, Ghana poured forward but were faced with a resolute Bafana Bafana rear-guard. John Boye restored parity after 73 minutes, latching on to a mishit Andre Ayew shot before swiveling to rattle beyond Nhlanhla Khuzwayo. Ghana then struck a post moments later as they searched for the go-ahead-goal that would take them through. That would arrive with just seven minutes remaining. Ayew was left alone in the South Africa box and rose to flick Baba Rahman's cross past the despairing Khuzwayo and send his country through.","Ghana and Algeria reach AFCON 2015 quarterfinals .

"Montreal's Olympic Stadium is known as the ""Big O,"" but for many of the city's taxpayers it is really the ""Big Owe."" ""It took us 30 years to pay it off and as a taxpayer I'm not too happy about it,"" said one Montreal resident, echoing the anger that many here still feel about the way the games were funded in 1976. ""It was not very well managed as a financial project. And we have a fabulous stadium, but I think it cost more than all the covered stadia in North America put together, "" said Dick Pound, former International Olympic Committee vice-president and a prominent resident of the Canadian city. However, Pound said calling the Montreal games of 1976 ""the bankrupt Olympics"" is a bad rap, and pointed out that the games actually made money. He said they paved the way for a new financial structure and the introduction of lucrative new television rights deals. People still come up to him and remember how well the Montreal games were staged and, in the end, how exciting they were, he added. ""They were pretty magic. All Olympics are magic but we had Comaneci with her first '10' and we had the Spinks brothers and we had Sugar Ray Leonard,"" he said. ""I mean we had some magnificent heroes of the modern Olympics."" But there is weariness in Montreal about being known for staging the Olympic games that almost bankrupted a city. The city's mayor at the time, Jean Drapeau, famously remarked that if the games end up having a deficit, men will have babies. And it was in large part due to the Olympic Stadium construction that the statement seems so ridiculous now.  The Olympic debt was nearly US$1.48 billion, and the stadium itself has been an engineering nightmare -- the retractable roof has struggled to worked properly over the years and almost forced the closure of the entire arena last year amid safety concerns. But the city's current government insists Montreal has put that legacy behind it and the Olympic stadium is now a key attraction. ""Now it is paid, and it's profitable for Montreal to keep it,"" said Manon Barbe, the councillor in charge of sports and leisure for the city. Barbe pointed out that the legacy of the games has created a sporting city that nurtures hundreds of elite athletes. ""Today Montreal has more than 1,000 elite athletics and more than 100 coaches. And if it's that high, it's not a coincidence. It is because we decided to keep most of our sporting facilities,"" said Barbe. One of those facilities is the Claude Robillard Sporting Center, an impressive training facility for more than a dozen sports that nurtures athletes of all ages. During the 76' games, the center hosted handball and water polo and was a training center for athletics, swimming and field hockey. Today, hundreds of aspiring athletes receive access to coaching and equipment, much of it subsidized by the city of Montreal. On most days you will find former Canadian Olympian Hank Palmer here on the track, either indoors or outdoors, or training in the pool or weights room. ""If I didn't have this center, I probably wouldn't be at the peak I am, I would not have the career I've been able to have,"" said the sprinter, who competed at the Beijing Olympics in 2008. ""This center really helped me develop myself, not only as a track athlete but an athlete in general because I have so many other sports around me. ""I can cross-train, do basketball, soccer, weight training, anything.""","The 1976 Montreal Olympics almost left the city bankrupt with its US$1.48 billion-price tag .

"(CNN)Ivory Coast reached the quarterfinals of the 2015 African Cup of Nations with a narrow victory over Cameroon -- but Guinea and Mali now face a drawing of lots on Thursday. The two teams drew 1-1 in Mongomo and cannot be separated by their head-to-head records, goal difference or goals scored. Instead, a random draw will decide which team goes through to play Ghana on Sunday. All four teams could have faced the drawing of lots had there been no winners from the group's final two games. The last time lots were drawn at the Cup of Nations was in 1988, when Algeria went through at the expense of Ivory Coast. In Malabo, Max Gradel's goal ensured the Elephants did not suffer the same fate this year. The Saint-Etienne forward guided Ivory Coast past Cameroon with a 20-yard first-half strike that evaded goalkeeper Fabrice Ondoa. Cameroon coach Volker Finke, criticized for his selection of inexperienced players at the tournament, threw on Lyon striker Clinton N'Jie in a bid to wrest control of the game. But Ivory Coast should have had a second through Wilfried Bony and go through as group winners to face Algeria in the last eight -- perhaps to the frustration of Premier League managers, with stars like Bony, Yaya Toure, Kolo Toure and Cheick Tiote still wrapped up in the Cup. Algeria now represents one of the competition's toughest tests for a generation of Ivory Coast players who have failed to deliver a major trophy despite their promise -- coming only as close as the final of the 2012 Cup of Nations final in 2012, where they lost to Zambia. Guinea and Mali will become the first teams to draw lots at the Cup of Nations for 27 years after a game dominated by back-to-back penalties. Kevin Constant chipped home from the spot to put Guinea ahead in the 15th minute, after Mali's Salif Coulibaly had headed the ball onto his own hand. Mali could have been level instantly as referee Mohamed Said Kordi immediately awarded a second penalty at the other end, but Seydou Keita's tame effort was easily saved. Mali's Modibo Maiga found an equalizer as both teams struggled to control themselves -- and the ball -- in a frenetic encounter not helped by a bobbling surface. Maiga, on loan at Metz from West Ham, headed in from the back post early in the second half, but Mali could not find a second goal despite a succession of opportunities. Ten of the 24 Cup of Nations games played to date at this tournament have now ended 1-1.","Ivory Coast through to AFCON 2015 quarterfinals, Cameroon out .

"It's an enduring game show that engenders affection while challenging even the most erudite among us. What is ""Jeopardy!""? Yes, for 50 years the famed answer-and-question show has maintained a steady popularity, through an 11-year network run, a short-lived reboot and, finally, a syndicated version with Alex Trebek that debuted in 1984. It's an unlikely success story. At the time ""Jeopardy!"" premiered on NBC on March 30, 1964 -- ""History"" was the first category introduced on the game board -- trivia-style game shows had been off the air for half a decade, a victim of the quiz-show scandals. The first host, Art Fleming, was an actor who'd never done a quiz show in his life. CBS dominated daytime with a combination of soap operas and sitcom reruns. And yet the first ""Jeopardy!"" lasted more than 10 years. Years later, when the syndicated show debuted in 1984, it faced equally long odds. A second Fleming version had failed. Trebek was best known for hosting a string of ratings losers such as ""The Wizard of Odds"" and ""Battlestars."" Moreover, the show was initially given absurd time slots and pulled from many stations. But here we are, 30 years later, and ""Jeopardy!"" is still one of the highest-rated syndicated programs, with runs such as Arthur Chu's recent winning streak keeping it in the news. (Disclosure: I was a contestant in 1988, though not nearly as successful as Chu.) What's the answer to its success? ""It's still the best mental exercise on television,"" says game-show authority Steve Beverly, a professor at Union University in Tennessee. ""It has one of the greatest play-along capacities. And if you're sitting at home, and you're good on respective categories, it gives you as a viewer the ability to sit there and say, 'You idiot!' when a contestant misses the question."" A model quiz show . The best game shows, says Beverly, are the simplest -- and the easiest to play along with at home. ""Million Second Quiz,"" NBC's recent foray into a prime-time quiz, was a flop not least because nobody understood the rules. (We'll leave the host out of it.) Carrie Grosvenor, game shows expert for About.com, agrees. ""I can't think of any other trivia-based show that has the same longevity, and I think it's because of the lack of gimmicks,"" she says. ""You could have watched it 30 years ago, and you watch it today and you can jump right in."" ""Jeopardy!"" itself struggled in a late-'70s go-round because a couple of unnecessary wrinkles were added. That version was one of the rare missteps in the history of the program. More often, thanks to its quick pace and clever questions, ""Jeopardy!"" has been regarded as a model of the quiz-show format. Only the old ""G.E. College Bowl"" is held in such high esteem among trivia players. Certainly, the show has become part of the pop cultural fabric. The catchphrase ""The answer is ..."" comes from the game, as does Trebek's sympathetic ""Sorry"" (best said with a Canadian accent). The ""Final Jeopardy!"" music is as well established for contemplation as ""Happy Birthday"" is for celebrations. Sitcoms have parodied it, celebrities have appeared on it, and a supercomputer used it to establish its superiority over humans (including 74-game champion and celebrity puzzlemaster Ken Jennings). It's even been tangential to a least one movie star's life. In 1968, Hutton Gibson -- Mel's father -- won more than $5,000 on the show. The money probably came in handy: Gibson soon moved his family to Ireland and later to Australia. Treating the game with respect . Beverly doesn't think any show will ever match it. Networks now want their game shows to run an hour, he says, but most play better at 30 minutes. Also, the last trivia-question game show to have an impact was ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" more than a decade ago. Even with its success in syndication, it's still no ""Jeopardy!"" Perhaps a more interesting question is who could succeed Trebek, who's now hosted for almost three times as long as Fleming (a man whose name has probably become a trivia question itself). The venerable emcee is now 73, and though ""Jeopardy!"" remains in the Top Five among syndicated shows -- right behind longtime stablemate ""Wheel of Fortune"" -- its average viewer is 64 years old.  A younger host might be able to pull younger viewers, who are increasingly distracted with other games -- on their cell phones. (In the NBC version's heyday, ""Jeopardy!"" was a favorite of college students, who flocked to its noon ET time slot.) CNN's Anderson Cooper has been suggested; so has the ""Today"" show's Matt Lauer. Both Beverly and Grosvenor are fond of Pat Kiernan, a Canadian like Trebek, who's hosted several game shows while also serving as an anchor for the New York news station NY1. Whoever it is, says Beverly, has big shoes to fill. Trebek, he points out, does the subtle things very well: He not only asks the answers and questions, but he keeps the game moving, takes an interest in the contestants and shows a sly sense of humor. ""It's got to be somebody who the viewer feels like treats the game with respect, and isn't trying to make it something that it isn't,"" he says. After 50 years, can anyone question that?","""Jeopardy!"" debuted on NBC in 1964 -- 50 years ago .

"Talks will resume next week on the future of Iran's nuclear program with the goal of beginning to draft a comprehensive agreement in May, a senior Obama administration official said on Friday. The next round of negotiations will seek to build on the work that has been done since January, when an interim deal between Iran and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council took effect. That deal eased some economic sanctions in return for Iran rolling back parts of its nuclear program, which the United States and others believe is designed to produce a weapon. Iran says its nuclear intentions are peaceful. While officials in Washington are optimistic that negotiations are progressing on track, a number of significant potential roadblocks need to be worked through if a long-term agreement is to be reached. These include determining what will happen to Iran's heavy water reactor in Arak, which the United States and its allies would like to see neutralized. That is a sticking point for Tehran. ""We know where the gaps are that have to be bridged,"" the official told reporters, adding that the United States remains clear-eyed about Iran's motivations. New concerns have also been raised over reports that Russia is laying the groundwork for an oil-for-goods deal with Iran, which could violate the terms of the interim agreement and derail future talks. According to the official, the reports are being taken seriously but are not yet having a substantive impact on negotiations. The administration has communicated to all parties that violating limits on Iran's oil exports could trigger new economic sanctions. This development comes less than three weeks after the United States and the European Union enacted a series of sanctions targeting Russian officials, in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea.","U.S. and allies are looking for a comprehensive deal to curb Iran's nuclear program .

"If you're like Derek Smith, you spend a lot of time on your smartphone. Then again, maybe nobody is quite like Derek Smith. In one recent week, the medical student sent 40 e-mails and 399 text messages, snapped 25 photos, bought two movie tickets, downloaded four songs, watched a full-length film, checked the weather forecast 15 times, shopped at Target, surfed the Web for 129 minutes and spent 5½ hours socializing with friends on Facebook -- all from his iPhone 4S. ""I am not my phone, but my phone is a reflection of me,"" said Smith, 26, of Louisville, Kentucky. ""It does a pretty good job of taking my life and folding it up into a nice little lightweight, pocket-sized summary.  It's almost like I am holding a copy of my brain in my hands."" As part of our Our Mobile Society series on how phones and tablets are changing our lives, CNN asked a handful of people to document everything they do on their smartphones over the course of a week: every text, every tweet, every minute spent scrolling through Instagram or playing ""Words with Friends.""  Some of the results are displayed here. It was an unscientific project. Our volunteers, self-described smartphone addicts, are probably much more active on their handsets than the average person. The idea was simply to demonstrate, whether we realize it or not, how much of our daily lives now is conducted through these little glowing screens. It's not just that we're on our phones a lot. It's that these devices have become time capsules of our lives, documenting our work, our social interactions, our purchases, our travels, our passions and our guilty pleasures. In one week in early September, Kathleen Baker sent 256 e-mails from her phone, many of those as part of her duties as director of housing for a university.  She also posted 34 updates or comments on Facebook, ""liked"" 18 posts and read 93 posts from friends (55 of them on her birthday). Somehow, she also spent another nine-plus hours that week using her phone to surf the Web, play games, check her bank balances and listen to audiobooks and music. ""I actually didn't log as many hours as I thought I would,"" said Baker, 46, who lives with her husband and their three young children in Seattle. ""I didn't include any time that I used my phone to entertain my kids. ... I am very aware of my dependency on my phone, so it wasn't too surprising. ""The phone definitely helps me keep up with all the moving parts of my life. I am almost always on the go, and it allows me to juggle everything,"" Baker added in an e-mail. ""While some people may feel tied to their jobs because of technology, I am happy to have the advantage of owning a smartphone.  I can't imagine how I would juggle a crazy job, three kids/family obligations, and doctoral studies without it!  I am a happy addict."" Like Baker, most people who shared their smartphone-usage habits said they view their phone as a hugely positive thing in their lives, not a burden or the root of an unhealthy addiction. ""My friends tell me that I am easily the most accessible person they know. My phone is my lifeline, and any attempt to reduce usage is just silly,"" said Stephen Anfield, 31, a freelance writer and social-media consultant. Anfield, who lives in Alexandria, Virginia, just outside Washington, sent 423 texts during the week he tracked his phone use. He also sent 228 Twitter messages, checked in to 26 locations on Foursquare, posted nine photos to Instagram and placed three orders from Five Guys Burgers. Oh, and he received two voice mails. He still hasn't listened to them. Like many people who participated in this experiment, Anfield prefers to communicate via text or e-mail. And like the others, he finds it difficult to go more than a few minutes without checking his Droid Razr. He sees his phone almost as an extension of himself. ""If somebody picks up my phone, it does make me nervous,"" he said. ""It's not a privacy issue. There's nothing that I'm hiding. I just think it's a very personal item."" Smith, the Louisville med-school student, said he didn't realize just how much he used his iPhone until he documented his usage for a week. ""I was stunned by just how integrated my phone has become in my life. It is almost an anatomical appendage, attached to my person as though it were a part of my hand,"" he said. On the few occasions Smith has left home without taking his phone, he's become anxious and depressed. ""My palms get sweaty, my heart races, I start biting my lip,"" he said in an e-mail. ""My mind is occupied by thoughts of going home to get the phone. I feel cut off from the world."" After jotting down all his phone usage and staring at the page -- almost 800 text messages sent and received -- Smith wondered whether he was relying on his phone too much. Should he cut back?  Was he missing out on the world around him?  Were his relationships suffering? Ultimately, he decided no. Smith also uses his phone to study and do medical research, and he believes the benefits of using it outweigh any potential downside. ""We do need to be careful not to digitalize our entire existence, not to replace our lives with a microchip,"" he said. But Smith believes that his phone enhances, and not detracts from, his real-life human interactions. To him it breaks down barriers and gives him freedom. ""I feel like my desktop/laptop anchor me into one place. They are ancient in a sense, the electronic devices of our parents and grandparents,"" he said. ""I do not want to be trapped by the confines of a desk and chair, and today's world is not as compatible with that type of device.  Today's world is too fluid for that.""","CNN asked people to document everything they do on their smartphones in a week .

"(CNN)Russia's ambassador to Britain was summoned to the UK's Foreign Office on Thursday to explain why two Russian bombers were flying over the English Channel this week, a representative of the office said. Two Russian bombers ""caused disruption to civil aviation"" when they flew near, but did not cross into, British airspace on Wednesday, the Foreign Office representative said. Two UK Royal Air Force jets intercepted the bombers, both capable of carrying nuclear weapons, south of Bournemouth, England, over the English Channel, a UK defense spokesman said Thursday. The British jets escorted the bombers for about an hour-and-a-half until the bombers left the area, the defense spokesman said. ""Russian aircraft maneuvers yesterday are part of (an) increasing pattern of out-of-area operations by Russian aircraft,"" the Foreign Office representative said. The representative did not elaborate on how civil aviation was disrupted. Details about what the Russian ambassador has told Britain about the incident weren't immediately available. Wednesday's incident would be the latest in what NATO has said is an increase in Russian military flights near alliance members' territory. In November, NATO said its members' jets had been scrambled more than 400 times in 2014 to intercept Russian military flights close to members' territories -- a 50% increase over the previous year. The increase harkens back to the days of the Cold War, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said November 20 during a visit to NATO member Estonia. ""This pattern is risky and unjustified,"" Stoltenberg said. ""So NATO remains vigilant. We are here. And we are ready to defend all allies against any threat."" In a November report, the European Leadership Network listed more than 40 ""close military encounters between Russia and the West"" in the eight months from March to October. Three of those, including a near-collision between a Russian military plane and a Swedish passenger aircraft carrying 132 people, were classified as ""high-risk"" incidents that could have led to direct military confrontation between Russia and the West, according to the report, titled ""Dangerous Brinksmanship."" UK jets intercepted more than 100 Russian aircraft last year, according to the British defense ministry. CNN's Lindsay Isaac and Brad Lendon contributed to this report.","Russian bombers disrupted civil aviation, UK Foreign Office representative says .

"He's one of the best basketball players in the country, and he led his team to victory in Monday night's NCAA championship game. But the University of Connecticut's Shabazz Napier recently told reporters he sometimes goes to bed ""starving"" because he can't afford food, despite that UConn's student-athlete guidelines include provisions for meal plans. The remark got the attention of state lawmakers in Connecticut, who are now exploring legislative ways to allow athletes at UConn, a state institution, to unionize -- much like athletes are attempting at Northwestern University. Rep. Matthew Lesser said he and other state lawmakers are considering legislation. Unlike at Northwestern, a private institution governed by the National Labor Relations Board, Connecticut law governs whether employees at a public institution can unionize. ""He says he's going to bed hungry at a time when millions of dollars are being made off of him. It's obscene,"" Lesser said. ""This isn't a Connecticut problem. This is an NCAA problem, and I want to make sure we're putting pressure on them to treat athletes well."" Napier recently called the Northwestern union ruling ""kind of great"" and said that although he appreciates his basketball scholarship, it doesn't cover all of his expenses. ""I don't feel student-athletes should get hundreds of thousands of dollars, but like I said, there are hungry nights that I go to bed and I'm starving,"" he said. Asked whether he felt like an employee -- a key distinction cited in the labor board's Northwestern ruling -- the Huskies point guard responded, ""I just feel like a student-athlete, and sometimes, like I said, there's hungry nights and I'm not able to eat and I still got to play up to my capabilities. ... When you see your jersey getting sold -- it may not have your last name on it -- but when you see your jersey getting sold and things like that, you feel like you want something in return."" The Huskies played the University of Kentucky Wildcats in the NCAA men's basketball finals in Arlington, Texas, on Monday night. Connecticut won 60-54, fueled by a game MVP performance from Napier, who had 22 points, six rebounds and three assists. UConn's student-athlete handbook lays out provisions for dining and says athletes can eat in any residence hall between 7 a.m. and 7:15 p.m. ""If you live off campus and your grant-in-aid includes meals, you may use your stipend to purchase an on-campus meal plan. ... This will entitle you to eat in any of the facilities,"" the handbook states (PDF). Phil Chardis, a spokesman for UConn athletics, issued a statement to that effect, telling CNN that ""Napier, like all our scholarship athletes, is provided the maximum meal plan that is allowable under NCAA rules. UConn does not have a cafeteria devoted specifically to student-athletes, but they have access to the same cafeterias which are available to all our students."" The comments come after a flurry of chatter about Northwestern football players challenging the long-established NCAA amateur model. Last month, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that Northwestern football players should be considered employees because of the hours they put in, the control the university has over them and the revenue they generate. But reaction was mixed, even among those who support NCAA reform. On Saturday, for the first time, two leaders on the Northwestern team said after a spring practice that they won't vote to unionize, and head coach Pat Fitzgerald said he told his players he didn't believe a union was in their best interest. Hours later, NCAA President Mark Emmert called the idea ""grossly inappropriate."" ""It would blow up everything about the collegiate model of athletics,"" he said. The players at Northwestern, led by former quarterback Kain Colter and Ramogi Huma, founder of the National College Players Association and the College Athletes Players Association, say they want better medical coverage, concussion testing, four-year scholarships that cover the entire cost of attendance and the possibility of being paid. Northwestern is appealing the ruling to the National Labor Relations Board national office and maintains that student-athletes are not university employees but ""students, first and foremost."" Huma has said the Northwestern ruling would have national implications, but he would not talk about whether other schools' teams were planning to hold union votes. At private schools like Duke and Stanford, the process would be similar to the path taken by Northwestern's players. There have been indications that officials at those schools are closely monitoring what happens at Northwestern. However, at public schools, the process would vary from state to state.","Student-athlete handbook says meals provided between 7 a.m. and 7:15 p.m.

"Hoping her celebrity will bring attention to the widening Syrian refugee crisis, actress and U.N. envoy Angelina Jolie spoke of the horrors that children, many of them orphans, have witnessed in Syria. ""Body parts separated, and burned people being pulled apart like chicken -- a little 9-year-old girl said that,"" Jolie said during her visit to a refugee tent camp in Jordan near the Syrian border. Every day, an estimated 2,000 Syrians are fleeing the relentless bloodshed that has gripped their country for the past 18 months, the United Nations' refugee agency said Tuesday.  That adds up to more than one quarter million Syrian refugees -- 253,000 -- now living in camps and other temporary homes inside Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon, and Iraq. U.N. breakdown of refugees . Life in the dusty Zaatari refugee camp outside Mafraq, Jordan, is not easy for those living there, many of whom have almost nothing after leaving their homes amid violence. Members of one family told CNN they had fled over the border with a 4-day-old baby and the clothes on their backs. Others complained of being short of food and water. Escorted to the border overnight by the Jordanian military, Jolie witnessed the moment when Syrians crossed into Jordan, becoming refugees before her eyes. The actress, who is raising six children with partner Brad Pitt, said she was greatly moved by what she had seen and spoke of the connection she felt in particular with the mothers and their children as they faced such challenging times. ""The amount of innocent children that have been reported dead, the amount of innocent children I've met here who are wounded and unaccompanied -- with their parents being killed and now they're on their own -- it's impossible to imagine any mother standing by and not stepping up and doing something to prevent this,"" she said. Jolie has made countless trips to the world's hotspots in her role as a U.N. goodwill ambassador -- including a visit to Syrian refugees in Turkey last year. Jordan is bearing the brunt of the refugee crisis sparked by Syria's civil war: More than 85,000 refugees have escaped to Jordan, and many more have fled to neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Iraq. ""Jordan has already reached its limit in absorbing the refugee influx, and what is needed now is to build more refugee camps for the Syrian refugees,"" Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh said. ""We have limited means, but this is the land of the good people, and we will share with them whatever we have, no matter how little (it) is."" Jolie urged other countries to do more to help the Syrian people. ""I am grateful to Jordan and the border countries for saving the lives (of those) who are dying in Syria. It's an extraordinary thing. We encourage the international community to support the people here until one day they go back home."" In other developments Tuesday: . Diplomacy: U.N. envoy set to meet Al-Assad . Veteran diplomat Lakhdar Brahimi, who was recently appointed the U.N. and Arab League envoy to Syria, will ""soon"" meet Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said. It's the latest international diplomatic effort to resolve the ongoing fighting that has claimed more than 20,000 lives over the past year and a half, according to Ban. Brahimi took the place of former U.N. envoy Kofi Annan, who resigned from the post last month after a failed peace deal with Syria.  Annan met with al-Assad during his peace efforts. Brahimi has acknowledged that he faces an uphill struggle, saying he is ""fully aware"" that his mission is ""extremely difficult."" He expects to travel to Damascus in the next few days, he said. Analysis: Al Qaeda looks to Syria to revive its fortunes . Humanitarian crisis: A quarter of Homs residents need aid . The humanitarian situation in Homs is ""grave and continues to deteriorate,"" according to a team of international health experts who visited the embattled province last week as part of a U.N. exploratory mission. Some 550,000 of the 2.2 million people in the province are in need of humanitarian aid, said World Health Organization spokesman Tarik Jasarevic.  And there is little time to get that aid into Homs, which has been a bastion of anti-government sentiment in the Syrian civil war. ""The urgency of scaling up delivery of humanitarian aid is exacerbated by the approaching winter,"" Jasarevic said. About half of the province's medical doctors have left, and only about three surgeons remain, he said. Facilities across the province have been damaged or destroyed, leaving only a fraction of the existing hospitals overwhelmed with patients and short on medicine and supplies. Photographer captures Syria's rebels, escapes death . On the ground: Damascus, Aleppo take another beating . Opposition activists reported a wave of fresh violence in Syria that claimed at least 130 lives nationwide, 30 of them in aerial shelling, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria. Among the deaths were 43 in Aleppo province, where a bakery in Marea was shelled, the LCC said. Syrian regime forces have previously attacked bread lines in the province, according to human rights groups and U.N. officials. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported that four military operations inflicted ""heavy losses upon the terrorists"" in Aleppo. Damascus and its suburbs also saw at least 34 deaths Tuesday. Fierce clashes between regime forces and rebels and heavy gunfire were reported by the LCC, as well as shelling of farms and residential areas. Earlier Tuesday, the opposition activist network reported that helicopter gunships were dropping so-called barrel bombs on the village of Dabaa in Homs province and the rebel Free Syrian Army was responding with machine guns. In Elfaya, in Hama province, the opposition network reports what it describes as a ""new massacre"" by regime forces, with eight people seized from their farms and executed. Four more are missing, the LCC said. In Homs, regime forces renewed heavy shelling by tanks and mortars, the LCC said.  And in Daraa, the birthplace of demonstrations against President Bashar al-Assad last year, the group reported ""heavy and indiscriminate gunfire by regime forces."" State-run media, meanwhile, reported Tuesday that 30 civilians were killed in a ""terrorist bombing"" Monday in front of an Aleppo hospital. The government said children were among those killed.

"In a rare public talk via the Web, fugitive NSA leaker Edward Snowden urged a tech conference audience Monday to help ""fix"" the U.S. government's surveillance of its citizens. He spoke via teleconference from Russia to an audience of thousands at the South by Southwest Interactive Festival in Austin. The event marked the first time the former National Security Agency contractor has directly addressed people in the United States since he fled the country with thousands of secret documents last June. In response to a question, Snowden said he had no regrets about his decision to leak the NSA documents, which showed the intelligence agency has conducted secret  monitoring of Americans' phone and Internet behavior in the name of national security. ""Would I do it again? Absolutely. Regardless of what happens to me, this is something we had a right to,"" he said. ""I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. And I saw the Constitution was being violated on a massive scale,"" he added, to applause from the 3,000 people in the auditorium at the Austin Convention Center. ""South by Southwest and the tech community, the people in the room in Austin, they're the folks who can fix this,"" Snowden said earlier. ""There's a political response that needs to occur, but there's also a tech response that needs to occur."" He appeared on video screens with a copy of the U.S. Constitution as a backdrop. The live stream was slow, repeatedly freezing Snowden's image onscreen. The pair of American Civil Liberties Union lawyers who hosted the discussion said Snowden's video, ultimately delivered via Google Hangouts, was streamed through several routers for security. Snowden also said Internet users need more awareness, and better tools, to help them secure their online information from prying eyes. While tech geeks may have no problem using encryption tools to scramble their messages or accessing the more-private ""deep Web"" via clients like Tor, Snowden said the average Web user should be able to access similar protections. ""This is something that people have to be able to interact with, and the way we interact with it now is not that good,"" he said. Snowden took questions from two moderators -- the ACLU's Chris Sogohian and Ben Wizner, his legal counsel -- from the audience, and from Twitter. The first, fittingly, came from Tim Berners-Lee, who created the World Wide Web 25 years ago this week. Berners-Lee asked Snowden what he would change about the nation's surveillance system. ""We need public oversight ... some way for trusted public figures to advocate for us. We need a watchdog that watches Congress, because if we're not informed, we can't consent to these (government) policies."" Asked about the difference between government surveillance and snooping by private Internet companies, Snowden said he considers government surveillance more insidious because ""the government has the ability to deprive you of rights. They can jail you."" Snowden, a former CIA employee and NSA contractor who fled the United States after leaking details of the American government's spy programs, was granted temporary asylum in Russia last year. He faces felony charges of espionage and theft of government property in the United States, and he has said he won't return until the U.S. changes its whistleblower protection laws. Reaction among SXSW audience members to Snowden's comments appeared mixed. ""I think it was right on,"" said Michael Chalcraft, a retired software entrepreneur from Seattle. ""There's always a balance between what the government should know about us and what we would expect to be private. ""If we're not constantly protecting that privacy, then we give it up."" But Megan Betterman, a health-care marketer from Minneapolis, didn't hear everything she wanted from Snowden. ""I wanted to hear about what his life is like there (in Russia), and whether he'll ever come back to the U.S.,"" she said. ""It (his talk) was very encryption-heavy."" More than 30,000 attendees are currently in Austin for the 10-day SXSW festival, which began Friday and wraps on March 16. The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit media organization, live streamed the session. Also scheduled to speak at the tech-themed conference Monday afternoon -- although in person -- was journalist and civil-liberties lawyer Glenn Greenwald, who broke the story about Snowden's leaks of classified NSA documents. Snowden's call for developers to create secure, private networks for their users is less of a no-brainer at South by Southwest than it may have once been. Having emerged from the counter-culture of the early Web, SXSW Interactive has exploded in recent years as more businesses have sought to tap into successful startups' millions of users. In the same Austin convention hall where Snowden called for new privacy tools, other sessions were helping entrepreneurs learn how to make money with the data they collect about the users of their products.","""Would I do it again?

"Two news organizations' stories about National Security Agency surveillance, based upon documents leaked by Edward Snowden, have been awarded the Pulitzer Prize for public service, often described as the highest prize in American journalism. The Washington Post and United States arm of The Guardian each received the prize on Monday. The Pulitzers are administered by Columbia University. More than a dozen prizes were announced on Monday, but the recognition of the NSA reporting was most significant because of the questions raised by Snowden's leaks and the reaction to them. The Pulitzer board's decision is bound to be controversial; then again, snubbing the NSA coverage would have been controversial, too. Snowden, who has been living in Russia while seeking asylum from U.S. prosecution, said in a statement that the Pulitzer board's recognition of the coverage was ""vindication for everyone who believes that the public has a role in government."" ""We owe it to the efforts of the brave reporters and their colleagues who kept working in the face of extraordinary intimidation, including the forced destruction of journalistic materials, the inappropriate use of terrorism laws, and so many other means of pressure to get them to stop what the world now recognizes was work of vital public importance."" While Snowden provided a trove of documents, reporters including Glenn Greenwald, working for the Guardian; Barton Gellman, working for The Post; and Laura Poitras, who worked with both, pored over the raw information, decided with their editors what parts were ethical to publish, and turned the information into stories that stunned readers around the world. On Monday the staffs of The Guardian and The Post celebrated the prize, ten full months after the first NSA stories were published. ""We're extremely proud and gratified to have been honoured by the Pulitzer board,"" Janine Gibson, editor-in-chief of Guardian US, said in a statement published on the British-based news organization's website. ""It's been an intense, exhaustive and sometimes chilling year working on this story and we're grateful for the acknowledgment by our peers that the revelations made by Edward Snowden and the work by the journalists involved represent a high achievement in public service,"" Gibson added. Marty Baron, editor of The Washington Post, told his newsroom that without Snowden, ""There would have been no public debate about the proper balance between privacy and national security. As even the President has acknowledged this is a conversation we need to have."" Other Pulitzer Prize winners included the staff of the Boston Globe, for breaking news reporting in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombings; Chris Hamby of the Center for Public Integrity for investigative reporting; Eli Saslow of The Washington Post for explanatory reporting; and two New York Times photographers, Tyler Hicks and Josh Haner.","The Pulitzer Prize for public service is among journalism's highest awards .

"Florida theater shooting suspect Curtis Reeves is lonely but confident that his self-defense claim will result in his acquittal, according to jailhouse phone calls released by the state attorney's office. According to CNN affiliate, Bay News 9, the 71-year-old, who is being held without bail on a second-degree murder charge, also tells his daughter he's concerned about the family's finances. ""I'm more worried about you all than I'm worried about me,"" he says. ""And we're more worried about you than we are worried about us,"" Jennifer Shaw, his daughter, responds. ""Well, if all the facts come out we all should be in good shape."" ""I know, but we just hate that you have to be in there right now."" In January, Reeves and his wife were attending a showing of ""Lone Survivor"" at a Wesley Chapel movie theater. Reeves left the theater to report to management that the man in front of him, Chad Oulson, was texting during the previews. When he returned the two exchanged words. Video from the scene appears to show Oulson snatching Reeves' popcorn off his lap and throwing it at him. Reeves responds instantaneously with a single, fatal gunshot. A preliminary hearing suggested the case will come down to whether a jury believe Reeves was intimidated by Oulson and acted in self-defense, or if Reeves overreacted to Oulson texting. In the jailhouse tapes, Reeves tells his daughter she can sell some of the family's belongings if necessary. ""If we need money, sell the motorcycle, motorcycle trailer, the kayaks, the trailer and --"" Shaw cuts him off: ""We have all that under control.  We're not even going to talk about it. Don't waste your time."" In another moment captured on tape, his young granddaughter greets him with a ""Hi!"" ""Hey sweetheart, this is Pawpaw. Pawpaw loves you,"" Reeves said. ""Can you tell grandpa 'I love you'?"" Shaw asks the child. Her age is not clear, but her voice is that of a very young girl. ""Pawpaw, love you,"" the granddaughter says.","Curtis Reeves says, ""Well, if all the facts come out we all should be in good shape""

"(CNN) -- Arab residents in the Middle East and North Africa may enjoy Hollywood blockbusters, but they are also wary of the content, saying it is potentially ""harmful to morality,"" a study finds. The ""Entertainment Media Use in the Middle East"" survey, commissioned by Northwestern University and the Doha Film Institute, interviewed more than 6,000 people -- both nationals and expats -- in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Egypt, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates. According to the survey 45% of respondents say they watch Hollywood movies, but 34% say American films have content that is ""harmful to morality."" Only 15% say U.S.-made films are good for morality -- as opposed to 71% who feel the same about Arab movies. The respondents are also conflicted about other foreign films. While two-thirds say people benefit from watching movies from different parts of the world, 65% say they prefer films that portray their own culture. More than half (54%) say films are an important source of information about their own culture. It is no surprise that an overwhelming number prefer Arab films, which are favored by more than 80% of overall respondents. In contrast, only around half of the citizens surveyed say they enjoy American and European movies. A large majority of respondents believe entertainment should be regulated for both romantic and violent content. More than two-thirds agree that films or other entertainment programs should be banned if they are deemed to be offensive. Respondents in Saudi Arabia and Egypt show the strongest support for censorship -- 76% and 77% respectively. Tunisia appears to be the most tolerant of all, but still more than half of its respondents support censorship. ""These apparently contradictory findings really are not, but reflect how the Arab world is coping with globalization and still grappling to preserve local culture,"" Everette E. Dennis, dean and CEO of Northwestern University in Qatar, says in a statement. In early March, three Gulf countries -- Qatar, the UAE and Bahrain -- announced that Hollywood biblical blockbuster ""Noah"" could not be screened in cinemas, saying the depiction of Noah -- whom Muslims revere as a prophet -- is taboo in Islam. Two months earlier, in January, censors in the UAE and Qatar cut more than 40 minutes of the three-hour-long ""Wolf of Wall Street,"" a Martin Scorsese-directed portrayal of a wayward stock trader, due to ""foul language and explicit content,"" angering moviegoers in both countries. Yet, the Northwestern University-Doha Film Institute survey shows that 72% of Qatari residents and 68% of Emirati residents generally support banning offensive content. Hollywood films are not the only ones that ran aground in the Middle East and North Africa. Qatar pulled Bollywood erotic horror flick ""Raaz 3"" from theaters in 2012 and, along with the UAE, banned Indian comedy ""Grand Masti"" last year. In 2012, a Tunisian court fined the head of a private TV station 2,400 Tunisian dinars (around $1,400) after his Nessma TV aired ""Persepolis,"" a French-American animated film whose depiction of God was slammed by some religious leaders as offensive to Islam.","Almost half of Arab residents in six Middle East and North African countries say they watch Hollywood movies .
But more than a third say American films have content that is ""harmful to morality.""
More than two-thirds agree that films or other entertainment programs should be banned if they are deemed to be offensive."
"""E.T."" may have soared in the movies. But as a video game, it was an epic turkey. When electronics pioneer Atari rushed a game based on the 1982 Hollywood blockbuster to market for its then-dominant home consoles, it was a flop, compounded by the fact that the infant industry was hitting its first slump at the time. So Atari literally buried the project, dumping truckloads of unsold games in a desert landfill in New Mexico. And amid a decade of entertainment-industry disasters bookended by the movie ""Heaven's Gate"" and Milli Vanilli, the ""E.T."" game quickly faded into urban legend. ""Riiiight,"" you say. No, really. And over the weekend, with a couple of hundred onlookers watching, excavators led by a documentary film crew began to unearth stacks of 30-year-old Atari cartridges from a landfill outside Alamogordo. ""Urban legend CONFIRMED,"" Larry Hryb, one of the creators of Microsoft's Xbox gaming platform, reported via Twitter from the dig site. Microsoft's Xbox Entertainment Studios is one of the backers of the planned documentary, tentatively titled ""Atari: Game Over."" Hryb also tweeted a photo of the first cartridge to be dug out. Not so fast, Atari historian Curt Vendel said Monday. ""E.T."" cartridges were just one of more than 20 titles found over the weekend, and may not make up more than a fifth of the estimated 700,000-plus units the ailing Atari discarded in 1983, he said. As far as he's concerned, the great ""E.T."" caper remains ""a myth."" ""This was a write-off dump,"" said Vendel, the co-author of a 2012 book on the company. Atari was being hit from all sides by a saturated market for arcade games, competition from other companies making games for its famous 2600 console and by a large volume of returns from retailers -- a problem it had never before faced and wasn't prepared to handle. ""Poor sales, the video game crash, 'E.T.'s' not a great game -- the whole thing kind of snowballs together, and then you find Atari is dumping cartridges in the desert,"" he said. ""That's how this whole myth kind of self-generated."" One of those on hand at the landfill Saturday was Howard Scott Warshaw, the game's designer. When excavators started to retrieve the first of what may be hundreds of thousands of copies of his misbegotten baby, ""Everybody went nuts,"" Warshaw said. ""I've been carrying this thing, the theoretically worst video game of all time, for 30 years now,"" he said. ""It was a game that was done in five weeks. It was a very brief development. I did the best that I could, and that's OK."" But seeing the cartridges emerge from the desert dust was a rush for Warshaw, who's now a Silicon Valley psychotherapist. ""Something that I did 32 years ago is still creating joy and excitement for people,"" he said. ""That's a tremendously satisfying thing for me now."" Today's Atari, which still sells games but no longer makes its own platforms, did not respond to a request for comment Sunday. The original company folded in 1984, and several successive companies have bought the name, Vendel said. ""E.T"" was rushed to stores in time for Christmas 1982, hobbled not only by its short development time but by a license and royalty agreement that promised the film's director, Steven Spielberg, $21 million, Vendel said. The company needed to sell out of the 5 million units it produced to break even; it sold  about 3.5 million by the following fall, he said. By that time, Atari was collapsing. About the time ""E.T."" hit the shelves, a poor and badly delayed earnings report spooked investors, ""and everybody started running to go sell,"" Vendel said. At its peak, it employed about 11,000 people; it was shedding employees by the thousands in 1983, and had only about 900 left by the time it closed down. ""They were just cutting the meat off the bone,"" he said. And so in 1983, the company dumped 14 truckloads of merchandise from its service center in El Paso, Texas, in the Alamogordo landfill, about 90 miles away, Vendel said. To keep scavengers from reselling them, the cartridges were covered by a layer of concrete. None of the ""E.T."" cartridges unearthed over the weekend was playable, Warshaw said. But he said there may be as many as 750,000 of them in the landfill, with many successful titles mixed in with the ""E.T."" games. ""It was the end of the first product life cycle, and nobody really knew what they were doing,"" Warshaw said. Now, manufacturers are designing their next systems even as their new ones start shipping to stores. ""It was a very wacky company, but that's one of the things that made it amazing place to work,"" said Warshaw, who's come to embrace the game's infamy. ""I don't really believe it's one of the worst games ever, but I really like it when people identify it that way,"" Warshaw told CNN. And because he also designed of one of Atari's best-rated games, ""Yars' Revenge,"" he said, ""I have the greatest range of any game designer in history.""","Not so fast, Atari historian says: E.T. copies may not be the bulk of the dump .

"Nightly gunshots wake Veronica Morris. When the community organizer walks down her block in Chicago's Englewood neighborhood, she is reminded of the officer who was shot there. Violence even surrounded her high school. Shots constantly rang out around the streets by the school building. Her junior year, a police car crashed right in front of her class. ""The violence is something we deal with daily and it's a real struggle,"" Morris said. ""You get scared and youth here are angry when their friends are shot. The violence really does something to a person."" ""It's sometimes bigger than the crime itself,"" Morris said. ""It affects you more, maybe even more than the person injured, because it lingers."" Studies show her experience is shared by thousands of Americans who live in tough urban areas. A growing number of programs treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in war veterans. But far fewer treat Americans who suffer from the PTSD that comes with their ZIP code. And this kind of PTSD may be affecting even more people. PTSD can directly hurt a person's brain by messing with the amygdala -- the part of the brain that triggers a chemical to release to help you decide between ""fight or flight"" in a threatening situation. If someone is exposed to prolonged, repetitive, or extreme trauma, the amygdala stays in alert mode. And the neurons, the pathways to this part of the brain, lose their ability to recover. A person's memory becomes corrupted like a bad computer hard drive and it can hurt a person's ability to separate out new experiences and determine whether they are safe or dangerous. The longer a person stays in the hyper-vigilant mode, the greater the chance of permanent damage. In a child, damage can be magnified and lead to problems like dissociative identity disorder. Chicago anti-violence program didn't do much, audit finds . A recent study that ran in the American Journal of Orthopsychiatry found that you don't even need a direct experience of a violent crime to be hurt by it. When there is a perception that there is disorder in a particular neighborhood, it causes some residents to suffer from PTSD. While the overall rate of violent crime has gone down in the United States -- so much that some sociologists call this the era of the ""Great Crime Decline"" -- there are still pockets where violent crime is so concentrated that neighbors can't escape it. After interviewing some 8,000 people in Atlanta, Emory University professor of psychiatry Dr. Kerry Ressler and his colleagues say that they are seeing evidence of higher rates of PTSD in this urban population than in war veterans. ""It's outrageous. This is -- well, it is not an epidemic of violence, that is not the right term for this. This is a pandemic,"" Ressler said. An epidemic is concentrated in a particular region. A pandemic is spread over a wider geographic area and impacts a much larger population. ""We are seeing the same (high instances of PTSD) in cities like D.C. and Chicago and L.A."" In surveying patients picked at random from Atlanta's Grady Memorial Hospital -- one of the busiest Level 1 trauma centers in the United States -- Ressler and his team found that at least half knew someone who had been murdered. Some two-thirds said they had been victims of a violent assault. A third had been sexually assaulted. This wide range of trauma experience meant that 32% of this population suffered PTSD symptoms. In continuing these surveys, the team wants a better scientific understanding about the lasting consequences of living in violent neighborhoods, Ressler said. ""We find you don't only lose a generation to this violence,"" in terms of the people who are directly hurt, he said. Instead, ""you are losing multiple generations (to the violence) in these war-torn inner cities."" ""With pandemic levels of disorder there are serious consequences,"" Ressler says. The violence ""makes it harder for kids to go through school or to play by the rules. It makes it harder for a parent to get a job or avoid addiction to drugs."" Community leaders often talk about education being key to lifting people from poverty, but Ressler believes that won't be enough. ""It is important to have programs like Head Start to help begin to break the cycle of poverty with education, but if we are not doing something for people's mental health, we may not be able to change this cycle,"" Ressler said. The chances that young men who experience trauma in their neighborhood will end up in jail are astronomically high, studies show.  Studies have also shown a high correlation between neighborhood disorder and physical abuse. There are further cognitive consequences as well. A study by Andrew Papachristos, a Yale sociology professor, found that some neighborhoods in Chicago have seen high violent crime rates for decades. Frequent violence has dramatically limited academic achievement in these neighborhoods. Exposure to violence is associated with cognitive and emotional stress that can lead to reductions in working memory. Another study looking at local violence in Chicago found that children who lived within 1,500 feet of a homicide had lower verbal and impulse control scores a week after the incident happened. Tests of older students showed similar results. She survived a standoff with a gunman -- could you? This concept that ""deteriorated"" neighborhoods have an impact on one's mental health is not new. At least 70 years ago, Chicago school researchers Robert E.L. Faris and H. Warren Dunham went through 30,000 psychiatric hospital admission records. They found high rates of substance abuse and even schizophrenia in these neighborhoods. Later studies found that high rates of depression were also common. One compounding problem is that there is an overall element of mistrust in rougher neighborhoods, studies show. People feel powerless to change their overall circumstances; therefore, PTSD -- which carries symptoms of hyper-vigilance, social separation and avoidance -- may amplify that mistrust. In an absence of a national public policy to address this serious problem, there are a handful of nonprofits that have overcome some of that neighborhood mistrust. Cure Violence, one of those nonprofits, takes a public health approach to violence prevention. Epidemiologist Dr. Gary Slutkin started the program after returning from Africa, where he had been fighting tuberculosis and AIDS epidemics. When he returned to Chicago, he saw similar patterns in outbreaks of violence and thought an epidemiological approach may stop it. Cure Violence concentrates its efforts on those who are at highest risk to cause violence. Workers living in the tougher Chicago neighborhoods listen for trouble. When they hear rumblings about a fight brewing, they intervene, talk to involved parties and try to mediate the problem before it escalates into violence. They also work with at-risk individuals to develop a plan to reject violence, whether that be through anger management, job training or substance abuse programs. ""If we can stop the violence and stop people's exposure to the violence early, we reduce its impact from spreading through the community,"" said Charlie Ransford, Cure Violence spokesman. Morris, meanwhile, is turning her experience growing up in a tough neighborhood into motivation to organize it. She's led highly visible protests to raise awareness of the consequences of violence. ""I always believe in hope, and I feel as an organizer that we've got to reinvest in these communities so that more of us won't have to continue to live this way,"" Morris said. Mother loses both sons in 19 days to gun violence . Ressler hopes there will be some kind of public policy initiative to address the consequences of violence before it is too late. ""By having a lifetime of trauma baggage and coming from multiple generations with trauma baggage, this is hard to overcome without help,"" Ressler said. There will be trouble, he said, ""if we don't start paying attention soon."" More from the series: How you make moral judgments .

"Ugh. Three outbreaks of illness affecting more than 100 people each have been reported aboard two cruise liners -- two of them in back-to-back cruises of the same ship -- according to the nation's leading health protection agency. The double dose of ill-fated cruises struck the Royal Caribbean's Grandeur of the Seas, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. During the ship's April 5 to April 12 cruise, 105 of the nearly 3,000 passengers and crew were affected -- primarily with vomiting and diarrhea, the disease agency said. During the ship's cruise the prior week, 117 passengers and crew members were struck, according to the CDC. Two CDC Vessel Sanitation Program environmental health officers and an epidemiologist were to board the vessel in Baltimore, Maryland, on Saturday to conduct an investigation. Specimens were being collected to be sent to the CDC lab for testing. ""We'll be working with both the medical teams as well as the crew on board the vessel and the cruise line with doing follow ups,"" Bernadette Burden, a CDC spokeswoman, told CNN affiliate WJZ. ""Really taking a look at their cleaning, sanitation and hygiene practices that are being employed on the ship to interrupt the spread of disease."" But the ship's owners were planning to plunge onward, departing as scheduled at 4 p.m. Saturday on the next cruise -- seven nights to the Bahamas. Royal Caribbean told WJZ that any would-be passengers feeling a little queasy about the prospect of leaving Saturday aboard the twice-stricken ship could reschedule. The third outbreak affected Princess Cruise's Crown Princess during a week-long cruise ending Saturday. In all, 152 of the more-than 4,000 passengers and crew were sickened. A lone CDC Vessel Sanitation Program environmental health officer was to board the ship upon its arrival Saturday in Los Angeles ""to conduct a targeted environmental health assessment, and evaluate the outbreak and response activities,"" the CDC said. The chief suspect behind all three waves of illness is norovirus, a highly infectious virus that can be picked up through contaminated food or water or by touching contaminated surfaces. It causes inflammation of the stomach, intestines or both, often leading to stomach pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Each year in the United States, it causes 19 million to 21 million illnesses, and contributes to 56,000 to 71,000 hospitalizations and as many as 800 deaths, CDC says. Cruise ships are a prime target. ""We have so many people together in a closed environment, eating in the same place,"" Catherine Troisi, associate professor of management, policy and community health at the University of Texas School of Public Health, told WJZ. ""That's why you see it."" How the Navy avoids norovirus . Are cruise ships floating petri dishes?

"The sales pitch was passionate: sprawling land along a desolate stretch of Oregon highway, ready to be turned into a pay-as-you-go terrorist training camp. ""It looks just like Afghanistan,"" wrote Earnest James Ujaama in his letter to prominent London cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri. Ujaama asked for trainers in both the physical and spiritual aspects of holy war to be sent from London, so fighters could be readied for the Afghanistan frontlines for a hefty per-person fee. Ujaama is a pivotal witness against al-Masri in his federal trial on terrorism-related charges and testified in a Manhattan courtroom Wednesday about his bumbling efforts to start an al Qaeda-style training camp in the United States. The Egyptian-born al-Masri, whose fiery rhetoric allegedly set the likes of failed ""shoe bomber"" Richard Reid and 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta on the path to radicalization, was extradited to the United States in 2012 after an extended legal battle. Among the allegations against him is the claim he aided in terrorism efforts by sending two men carrying cash and training materials to Oregon in response to Ujaama's pitch. He could face life in prison if convicted. Defense lawyer Joshua Dratel told the jury during his opening statement that no evidence shows his client gave directions or orders relating to the alleged crimes. Rather, he was merely a ""commenter on events and issues"" when he praised Osama bin Laden in his sermons and celebrated the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington. ""These are ideas, not acts,"" he said. ""These are expressions, not crimes."" During his testimony Wednesday, Ujaama said his letter to al-Masri promised scores of eager recruits who had already pledged their loyalty to the preacher, along with a hillside hiding place and personal security detail when he arrived at the camp. They were amassing stockpiles of weapons and building living facilities, even a mosque, Ujaama wrote. In reality, only two run-down trailers sat atop the barren ranch land, but Ujaama reasoned that things could be taken one step at a time: ""If he accepted it, I'd know I had a buy-in and I'd start building."" Al-Masri's presence was crucial to getting the cash flow started, he testified. ""He'd be the star attraction."" When Ujaama called al-Masri to confirm he had received the detailed note and draft for a camp advertising flier, al-Masri first berated him for being careless and risking law enforcement interception, testified Ujaama, who faxed his letter to the high-profile British mosque leader from a Kinko's near his home in Tacoma, Washington. Al-Masri nevertheless agreed to support the transatlantic venture, Ujaama said. Another witness, Eva Hatley, whose husband owned the property, testified last week she had envisioned it as a ""kitchen farm"" where women from their Seattle Muslim community could come to learn to grow vegetables, canning and raising animals. Hatley and her former friend Angela Morris said Ujaama arrived with al-Masri's men in December 1999 and that the pair's apparent leader was a physically imposing, temperamental man who claimed to have served as Osama bin Laden's bodyguard. When he saw the conditions at the ranch, he flew into a rage. ""He was very upset. There were no men, there were no weapons, there was no hole for Abu Hamza,"" Hatley testified. She said the men discussed a plan to kill Ujaama and take his pregnant wife hostage until she gave birth to their child, after which they would kill her as well and take the infant. Despite the disappointing state of affairs, al-Masri ordered the men to stay and continue the effort for several weeks, Hatley testified. They conducted perimeter checks and did calisthenics, and once made Morris' mentally disabled teen brother kneel in the dirt for a throat-slitting demonstration, according to testimony. Hatley decided she had finally had enough when the men demanded she use a password to exit her own doublewide trailer, the soft-spoken woman testified. ""I got in his face about that,"" she said. Not long after that, the men abandoned the effort and returned to Europe. After his 2002 arrest, Ujaama himself faced charges of aiding terrorists through the Oregon plot and escorting a recruit from London to training in Afghanistan, allegedly on orders from al-Masri. He was released in 2010 as part of an agreement to testify for the government. The trial of al-Masri opened less than a month after Osama bin Laden's son-in-law, Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, was found guilty in the same Manhattan federal courthouse of helping al Qaeda members conspire to kill Americans and providing material support to terrorists. Prosecutors said Abu Ghaith, a Kuwaiti cleric, played a crucial role as the organization's principal mouthpiece and recruiter, helping ""restore al Qaeda's trove of new terrorists"" as deadly missions turned its members into martyrs. Al-Masri cuts an unusual figure in the courtroom; missing one eye and both hands, he wears an occasional writing prosthesis on his right forearm rather than the infamous hook-like device he's often seen sporting in photographs. Opting for comfort, he asked his attorneys for sweat pants and T-shirts for the proceedings rather than a suit. He has said he plans to testify in his on defense. Ujaama resumes his testimony on Thursday.","London cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri is on trial in federal court on terrorism-related charges .

"Jonathan Pollard, the former U.S. intelligence agent who was convicted of spying for Israel, could be released before the Jewish holiday of Passover as part of efforts to save Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, an Israeli official involved in the talks told CNN. Suggestions for deals for Pollard's release have been floated over the years but have not materialized. Passover starts on April 14. Talk of Pollard's possible release came as Secretary of State John Kerry traveled to Israel on Monday to try to mediate a dispute between Israel and the Palestinians over the release of Palestinian prisoners. Kerry was in Belgium on Tuesday. He was expected to go back to Israel on Wednesday and to visit Ramallah, West Bank, but a senior State Department official told CNN that trip is no longer happening. Kerry stated Tuesday night that ""no agreement has been reached with respect to any prisoner"" -- be it Pollard, whom he was asked about, or anyone else -- though talks involving all parties are ongoing in hopes of reaching a broader agreement. ""At this point in time, no agreement has been reached with respect to any prisoner, not even the ones that at this moment are at issue in terms of the transfer. The Cabinet in Israel has to vote. I'm not sure exactly when that might take place or not. So there is no agreement at this point in time regarding anyone, or any specific steps, there are a lot of different possibilities in play,"" Kerry said. ""It is difficult, it is emotional, it requires huge decisions, some of them with great political difficulty,"" he continued. ""... We are continuing, even now ... to find the best way forward."" White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tuesday that President Barack Obama hasn't decided whether to release the convicted spy at Israel's request. ""The Israelis frequently raise this issue, and they have raised this issue in our discussions,"" Carney said. ""Beyond that, I'm not going to get ahead of the work that Secretary Kerry is doing and the conversations that he's having."" Pollard's possible release was being discussed as part of a broader agreement that has not been finalized, according to sources familiar with the talks. In exchange for the release, the sources have said that Israel would have to make significant concessions to the Palestinians, which could include a settlement freeze, the release of additional prisoners beyond the current group in dispute and an agreement to continue peace negotiations beyond the end-of-April deadline. Pollard was convicted in 1987 of spying for Israel and is serving a life sentence in the United States. His imprisonment has been a source of tension between the United States and Israel. 27 years later, Pollard case remains a diplomatic thorn . Parameters . The Israeli official said the parameters of a deal still emerging include negotiations with the Palestinians continuing into 2015, and an agreement that during that time, Palestinians would refrain from taking their case to international bodies. However, Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian lawmaker who met Monday with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss Kerry's efforts, said the Palestinian leadership believes the Israelis are making claims of an ""emerging deal"" to create an impression that a breakthrough is imminent so that when it falls apart, it can be blamed on the Palestinians. Barghouti doubted the notion that the Palestinians were on the verge of signing a deal and said Abbas is increasingly convinced that Israel is not interested in any process that would lead to Palestinian statehood. According to the Israeli official, though, a fourth Palestinian prisoner release would go ahead and would include Israeli Arabs, the official added. An additional 400 Palestinian prisoners would be released. Israel would determine those to be released, and they would not have blood on their hands, the official added. Regarding settlements, there would not be a total freeze, but ""Israel will act with great restraint,"" he said. But in what one nongovernmental organization's director called ""a blow to the American efforts in trying to achieve an agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians,"" Israel pushed forward Tuesday with tenders for new settlement construction in Gilo, in East Jerusalem. ""Israel today re-announced pushed tenders for 708 new settlement units in Gilo that were originally published in November,"" said Hagit Ofran, director of Peace Now, an Israeli NGO that monitors Israel's settlement construction in the West Bank and Jerusalem. The Israeli official said Jerusalem would not be included in the provision calling for no tenders for new housing in the West Bank, although work would proceed on tenders already issued, the official said. The halt on new tenders refers to housing only. Construction of other infrastructure, such as roads and hospitals, he said, would continue. Asked about the talks and a possible release, Asher Mivzari, a spokesman for The Free Jonathan Pollard Committee, said the committee was not ""reacting to the news."" ""Their message all along has been that Jonathan Pollard should have been freed a long time ago and this should be an outcome of justice in the American legal system,"" he said. Separately, a spokesman for Cabinet Minister Uri Ariel confirmed he had said he was against the release of ""murderers"" in exchange for Pollard. Opinion: Trade a spy, get Middle East peace? Parole consideration . Israel has in the past tried to link Pollard's release to peace negotiations. Current and former U.S. officials and experts have suggested the United States government might tie his release to a comprehensive peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians. Pollard is up for parole consideration in November 2015, and the United States is running out of time to use his possible release for leverage with Israel. Carney, the White House spokesman, said on Monday that it is a ""complicated issue"" and declined to ""get into details"" about the negotiations. ""And with regards to Mr. Pollard, he is a person who was convicted of espionage and is serving his sentence, and I don't have any update on his situation,"" Carney said. But the fact the United States is apparently willing to discuss his release before even a framework agreement has been reached between the parties shows the extraordinary efforts Washington is making to salvage the troubled negotiations. When asked whether Pollard was a topic in Kerry's talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki stuck to the White House line and said she had no updates on his status. Talks hit a snag . The peace negotiations, which began in July, have hit a snag over whether Israel will agree to release more than two dozen prisoners, including 14 Arab Israelis whom Israel considers terrorists. They were scheduled to be freed on March 29, and now Palestinian negotiators are threatening to end the negotiations over the delay. Israel has already released three groups of prisoners, most of whom have served lengthy prison terms for attacks on Israelis. But this final release is especially contentious because it includes convicted murderers. Netanyahu has said he would seek approval for any further releases with his Cabinet, which has been critical of the previous releases. Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Danny Danon told CNN he will resign if Israel goes ahead with the prisoner release, and other Likud Party members in the Cabinet, along with members of the HaBayit HaYahudi Party, which has 12 members in the Knesset, could join him, creating a political crisis. Netanyahu has also said he would not release any more prisoners if Abbas did not agree to continue negotiations and to stop threatening to seek recognition for Palestinians before international bodies. A new possible stumbling block in the overall talks arose Tuesday, when Abbas signed 15 requests to have his government join international organizations, according to Palestinian lawmaker Mustafa Barghouti. Asked about this development, Kerry said none of the organizations that Abbas asked to join ""involved the U.N."" Furthermore, he scuttled any thought that this could derail negotiations while insisting that the key players remain engaged. The United States is ready and willing to play a significant role, Kerry said. Still, Kerry stressed that it's the Israelis and Palestinians who will ultimately decide if a deal gets done. ""In the end, this is up to the parties,"" he said. ""... The leaders have to make the decisions.""

"(CNN)It was FIFA's handling of the report into bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups that convinced Luis Figo it was time to take a stand. The 42-year-old, a man of formidable football pedigree, confirmed to CNN in an exclusive interview on Wednesday he wants to replace Sepp Blatter as president of world soccer's governing body. After growing weary at FIFA's increasingly tarnished reputation, he's asked supporters the world over to follow his crusade to rehabilitate an organization he says has become a byword for scandal. The tipping point came towards the end of 2014, when FIFA opted not to publish a report by U.S. lawyer Michael Garcia into allegations of corruption during the race to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, releasing its own summary of his findings instead. ""I think that was the moment of change and the moment I thought something had to be done,"" Figo told CNN anchor Alex Thomas. ""If you are transparent and if you ask for an investigation, a report, which you have nothing to hide, why don't you make public that report? If you have nothing to hide about that, you have to do it."" Having decided to run, and with a trophy-laden career to bolster his credibility, Figo now must convince the majority of FIFA's 209 member associations that he means business. The former Portugal captain has made transparency a key plank of his pitch for soccer's top job, underlining that a change in leadership and governance is the only way to revitalize FIFA's reputation. He also vowed to release more of FIFA's vast financial reserves to its federations in the hope of boosting the sport at grass roots level. And he gave short shrift to any suggestion that his candidacy was a publicity stunt, an accusation leveled at former France international David Ginola who recently launched his bid alongside a bookmaker and confirmed he was being paid for his involvement. ""I don't need to be a candidate to get publicity. I had a fantastic career and I'm very proud of so many years playing at a high level,"" explained Figo. ""I'm not getting paid. Fortunately I have a situation that allows me to pay for my candidature, and I'm lucky that I can pay my travels and support my expenses. ""I think the organization is right now not a football organization-- it is more a political organization,"" he added referring to FIFA. ""We have to care about the future of football, try to restore the leadership, the governance and big transparency and solidarity with the federations."" Figo does not want for style or substance, but his decision to take aim at Blatter is a gamble. The 78-year-old has been ensconced in FIFA's corridors of power since 1998 and still enjoys firm support among its member associations despite the increasingly beleaguered nature of his rein. Many commentators see May's election as a forgone conclusion, but even if Figo is the only candidate to make his way onto the ballot paper it will still represent progress from 2011's ballot. Back then, Qatar's former FIFA member Mohamed Bin Hammam withdrew from the race after he was suspended on bribery charges, leaving Blatter to run unopposed. Figo joins a list of presidential hopefuls that includes Ginola, independent candidate Jerome Champagne, Asian Football Confederation vice-president Prince Ali and Michael van Praag, the head of Dutch football. Of those names, it is arguably only Figo who has the potential to loosen Blatter's stranglehold on FIFA's top job. ""I can say I'm a real candidate after today and I'm looking forward to opening the debate and trying to get the support of many federations to have the chance to be the president,"" added Figo. ""I think to [take] this step you have to be prepared. Of course I did my homework but I have a lot of things that I have to learn, to improve, but if your mind is open I think it's much more easy. ""I have my ideas about what is football and what is good for improving FIFA but I think my experience of my career is a positive thing that allows me to understand a lot of the game. My first priority is to know from the federations what they need. ""I think one important thing is to increase the solidarity payments to the federations, because right now FIFA has so many financial reserves that belong to the federations."" Figo: A modern footballing great . Figo's glittering, and at times controversial, career began with Sporting Lisbon in Portugal before he moved to Spanish giants Barcelona in 1995, quickly establishing himself as one of its best players. Alongside an all-star cast that included Brazilian pair Rivaldo and Ronaldo, as well as Dutch striker Patrick Kluivert, Figo was part of the Barca team that won back-to-back La Liga titles in 1998 and 1999. He also won five cup competitions in Catalonia, including the UEFA Cup Winners Cup and the UEFA Super Cup in 1997. By this time Figo had established himself as one of the finest players in the world and one who was adored by the club's fans. So when it was announced he was leaving to join Barca's biggest rival, Real Madrid, it was seen as not just a betrayal of the club but the whole region. Then Barcelona president Joan Gaspart reacted to news that Real had activated Figo's £37.5 million ($56m) buyout clause by vowing: ""I won't forget this. Someone who does this to me will pay for it."" Figo was denounced as a ""money-grabber"" and was afforded a vitriolic reception on his first visit to Barcelona's Nou Camp stadium with his new club, though it would intensify in the 2003 season as coins, bottles and even a pig's head was thrown at him by a rancorous home support. But his defection to the Bernabeu helped Real re-establish themselves as Spain's pre-eminent force as they won the La Liga title in 2001, going on to secure a prized European Champions League crown the following season. His signing kick-started Real's ""Galacticos"" brand with stellar names such as Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo and David Beckham also acquired. By the time Figo left for Inter Milan in 2005 he had collected seven trophies -- the same amount he won at Barca. In Italy, Figo won four successive Serie A titles, one Italian Cup and three Italian Super Cups before retiring in 2009. Figo also represented his national team with distinction, becoming the country's most capped player with 127 appearances. Portugal made the semifinals of Euro 2000 and went out of the 2002 World Cup at the group stage before suffering a heart-breaking, shock defeat to Greece in the final of Euro 2004, which it hosted. He retired from international football at the 2006 World Cup, after he captained his side to the semifinals, where it was beaten by France. The race to become president . Figo's declaration means there are now five potential challengers to Blatter's throne, but two important hurdles must be overcome before any of them can officially join the race. First, they need to prove ""an active role in association football for two of the five years preceding his proposed candidature,"" then demonstrate they've got the backing of five of FIFA's 209 member associations. Jerome Champagne, an independent French candidate, was the first to declare his bid back in September, but revealed earlier this month he was struggling to attract five nominations. Prince Ali, who has been the president of Jordanian football since 1999, announced his intention to stand on January 6 but has said very little publicly about his campaign. It remains to be seen whether he can muster five backers, but Blatter's stranglehold on power was underlined when the Asian Football Confederation confirmed its intention to support him instead of Prince Ali, who is its vice-president. Ginola, a former player with French champions Paris Saint-Germain and English Premier League sides Tottenham and Newcastle, launched his bid in London on January 16 saying it was time to ""reboot football."" But his charge was immediately undermined by the revelation that his bid was being backed by bookmaker Paddy Power, who has a self-confessed penchant for mischief, and that he was being paid £250,000 ($375,000) for his involvement. Ginola's prospective bid is reliant on crowdfunding to help him through to May's elections but so far it has only raised £6,300 ($9,500). Doubts also remain as to whether he'll be able to find five associations to support him. Van Praag, who has been head of Dutch football since 2008, entered the fray earlier this week, vowing to ""normalize and modernize"" FIFA. The 66-year-old was critical of Blatter when the Swiss backtracked on his decision to stand down after his current term as president ended, and is confident he has already secured five nominations. As part of his candidature, Van Praag is reportedly ready to offer Blatter an advisory role if the Dutchman is elected FIFA president. The deadline for applications was on Thursday but it might be next week before FIFA announces who has made their way onto the ballot paper for the election, held in Zurich on May 29.","Luis Figo exclusively reveals to CNN he wants to become FIFA president .

"Looking to turn a few degrees in his long-awaited ""pivot to Asia,"" President Barack Obama embarks on Tuesday on a four-country tour of the region in the hopes of convincing Pacific allies the United States remains focused on them. But like Obama's last attempts to renew diplomatic and economic attention on Asia, this trip comes amid distractions: unrest in Ukraine, recent transportation disasters at two of his stops, and wary lawmakers back home who aren't on board with Obama's plan to expand trade. The trip itself -- with stops in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines -- is a rain-check from last October, when the White House nixed a visit to Asia at the last minute amid the government shutdown. The cancellation only prompted more questions about the administration's capacity for a foreign policy realignment that sought to counterbalance China's growing influence in Asia. That repositioning first came about during Obama's first term, when the President and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made a point of referencing a ""pivot"" toward relations in the Asia Pacific -- and implicitly, away from traditional foreign policy hotspots in the Middle East and Europe. But in the intervening years, heightened diplomacy with Iran, and more recently unrest in Ukraine, have grabbed far more headlines than the United States' increased efforts in Asia. And a vow to allocate more military resources in the region coincided with a plan to reduce Pentagon spending substantially. ""The region does, I think, feel like there's a bit of distraction here in the United States,"" said Victor Cha, a former director of Asian affairs in the George W. Bush White House who is now a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""In polite company, people won't say it, but behind closed doors, I think they'll openly ask where the pivot is -- they don't know where it is -- or the rebalance in the second term,"" Cha said at a briefing with reporters last week. ""Strong messaging on the U.S. commitment to the region I think is an important way to try to compensate or try to fill that gap."" Administration officials say U.S. alliances in Asia have remained strong despite several years of flashpoints in other parts of the world. And they bristle at the notion the White House and its diplomats can focus only on one region at a time. ""There are often questions raised about whether or not we get distracted with Ukraine or the Middle East, and this trip is yet one more example that we can walk and chew gum at the same time,"" said Evan Medeiros, Obama's senior director for Asian affairs. ""There are huge parts of the government -- I'm part of them -- that are devoted to advancing U.S. interests in the Asia Pacific."" While there aren't any major announcements expected on this week's trip, Obama officials hope the visits will yield progress toward showing America's commitment to each country, and the region as a whole. In Japan, the President will look to further progress on a trade deal, though Democrats on Capitol Hill have proven wary of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, at least until November's midterm elections. And in the Philippines, a new military cooperation agreement is being negotiated that could boost U.S. troop presence in a region where China has pushed for greater control. Elsewhere, Obama's schedule is dotted with social and cultural events to highlight the region's dynamic growth -- including an innovation center in Kuala Lumpur and a science exhibit in Tokyo. ""I think we go to the region at a time when our allies in the region are very much appreciative of and committed to our alliance relationships,"" said National Security Adviser Susan Rice during a briefing Friday. ""These alliances are only strengthening in the context of a more uncertain security environment."" Fueling that uncertainty is the situation in Ukraine, where pro-Russian forces effectively annexed the Crimean peninsula and have moved into the eastern part of the country. The White House has announced several rounds of sanctions against Russian officials and businesses, but Obama has been explicit that any military intervention is out of the question for the United States. That's a cause for concern among some Asian allies -- including Japan -- who have their own territorial disputes with China, though some experts say that worry is overblown since security pacts in place would compel more robust U.S. response in a conflict between Asian nations. ""The notion that Japanese or Taiwan or American allies in the region are nervous about the U.S. reaction to the Ukraine and that means something for them I think is fundamentally false,"" said Jeffrey Bader, who until 2011 served as senior director for East Asian Affairs on the National Security Council. ""The U.S. has a mutual security treaty with Japan for over 50 years which is NATO-like in its firmness,"" said Bader, who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Obama's trip also comes as two of his stops contend with major transportation disasters. Both the sinking of a ferry full of high schoolers in South Korea and the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 have occupied those countries' leaders in recent weeks. Ben Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, said Monday it was likely Obama would express his support for the ferry victims' families during his visit to Seoul. Last week, Obama said the tragedy was ""heartbreaking."" In the case of Malaysia, officials' response to the crash has drawn wide criticism, though not from the White House -- and that's expected to remain the case through next week. ""This trip has a very positive, affirmative agenda and that's how we are looking at it -- as an opportunity to solidify and modernize our alliances and partnerships,"" Susan Rice said Friday.","President heads out on four-nation tour to convince allies the U.S. is focused on them .

"African safaris have upped their game. We're not talking about the ""Big Five"" beasts -- lion, leopard, elephant, rhino, buffalo -- that people pay top dollar to see. We're talking about the accommodations. For those with budgets as grand as the sweeping plains of southern and eastern Africa, exploring the wilderness needn't come at the expense of luxury. Lake Manyara Tree Lodge (Lake Manyara National Park, Tanzania) Lake Manyara is the only permanent lodge within Lake Manyara National Park -- it comprises 10 stilted tree house suites in the boughs of ancient mahogany trees. The words ""tree house"" might be misleading -- there's not a splintered plank in sight. Instead, there are free-standing bath tubs (complete with a nightly sprinkling of rose petals) and enormous bathrooms with twin sinks and split-level living areas. After dusty safaris, guests are welcomed back with gin and tonics and cold, scented towels.

The units all have enormous canopied verandas replete with roll-top bath tub and infinity pool. After a day of lion spotting, guests retreat to the Nasaro spa tent where the signature treatment is a ""healing journey"" involving rose quartz and amethyst. Dinner is served in a communal area but staff can arrange champagne barbecues in the bush. Mahali Mzuri, Motorogi Conservancy, Masai Mara, Kenya; +44 208 600 0430; from $800 per room per night . Bushmans Kloof Wilderness Retreat (Western Cape, South Africa) Bushmans Kloof Nature Reserve makes no pretense of being under canvas, housing its 16 luxurious rooms and suites within a main lodge or individual cottages. Although the Bushmans Kloof Wilderness Reserve isn't a Big Five reserve, it does contain bushman's rock paintings and is home to the endangered Cape Mountain Zebra.

"The NAACP needs to sit down. Though it's debatable how effective a punishment Donald Sterling's lifetime ban from the NBA will be -- considering that for the time being, he still owns and thus profits from the L.A. Clippers -- the one voice that should not be involved in this discussion is that of the NAACP. Not after news that the Los Angeles chapter was prepared to bestow upon the disgraced Sterling -- whose racist behavior has long been known -- a second lifetime achievement award next month. (The offer, not surprisingly, has been withdrawn.) On Tuesday, after NBA Commissioner Adam Silver brought down punishment on Sterling, the NAACP added its voice to a joint statement with the National Urban League, the National Action Network and the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation that said ""Sterling's long-established pattern of bigotry and racist comments have not been a secret in the NBA ... yet until now, they have been tolerated and met with a gentle hand and a blind eye."" Say what? Tax records accessed on CitizenAudit.org, according to an article in the Huffington Post, revealed that the NAACP's L.A. branch had been party to the sanitizing of Sterling's legacy.  How? The group has received $45,000 from Sterling's foundations, which, given the real-estate mogul's net worth of nearly $2 billion, is peanuts. The phrase ""sell out"" is one that gets tossed around, but for some reason, it doesn't quite cover the NAACP's L.A. chapter in this case. The first time Sterling was awarded a lifetime achievement award by the group was in the midst of a lawsuit for housing discrimination based upon race. To decide to honor him with the award a second time, after he had paid millions to settle multiple discrimination suits, after learning that he allegedly said that ""all the blacks in this building, they smell, they're not clean"" and ""Mexicans ... just sit around and smoke and drink all day ... so we have to get them out of here,""  is not selling out. Selling out makes financial sense. No, considering what $45,000 means to a man of Sterling's wealth, honoring him with awards is just giving integrity away. I understand that Sterling has donated to other black groups and established a scholarships for black students at UCLA. And while that's a positive, I also understand that such donations are tax-deductible and do not require him to actually be around black people. Something, according to the now-infamous recordings, he is not a big fan of. At least not at his games. The NAACP's willful blind spot is particularly disturbing when you consider the growing wealth gap between blacks and whites in this country and that the biggest factors in that gap are fair housing and education. How could an organization supposedly dedicated to the economic advancement of blacks honor someone the Department of Justice said was working against its mission? This curiosity is very similar to the New York chapter of the NAACP joining a lawsuit with the United Federation of Teachers in 2011 in an effort to squeeze out successful charter schools and protect failing traditional public schools. Thousands of parents, many of them minorities, protested. As was the case with the L.A. chapter, money reportedly was a factor in the New York chapter's allegiance. It's fine for the national organization to characterize questionable decision-making by local chapters as anomalies, but it's hard to view the goings-on in New York and Los Angeles, the two largest cities in the country, as just being local. No, instead of worrying about joining in the censure of Sterling, the NAACP -- which is currently searching for a new executive director -- should worry about itself. When the NAACP held a funeral for the N-word in 2007, it felt as if the organization had buried its relevance beside it.  It didn't help that the person helping lead the ceremony was former Detroit Mayor/felon Kwame Kilpatrick. Yeah. In light of the crippling socioeconomic impact that housing discrimination has had on minorities in general and Los Angeles in particular, for chapter President Leon Jenkins to say ""God teaches us to forgive"" in the same interview Monday in which he said ""we are negotiating with him about giving more moneys to African-American students at UCLA,"" it sounds to me the NAACP needs to take that finger it's wagging at Silver and the NBA and point it back at themselves. Silver's working to clean up his house, but the NAACP still looks dirty.","LZ: It's hypocrisy for NAACP to join groups in calling out NBA's former tolerance of Sterling .

"(CNN)American society has a double standard when it comes to sexuality. We have a puritanical taboo against talking about sexuality directly, yet we are fine with the sexual images that pervade television and glossy magazines. We sexualize children in advertising by turning girls into objects that bear little resemblance to what young women actually look like. And we do this in movies where even animated characters take on curvaceous hips and big breasts. But then when it comes to our kids having some kind of sexual identity, we freak out. That needs to stop. We vilify sexting, or sending sexually explicit messages and images via text messaging. But sexting, if not taken to the extreme or exploited by bullies, is not the social evil that it is made out to be. Sexting is a normal part of human sexual expression not only for adolescents, but for adults as well. New data from the Pew Internet and American Life Project show that adults 25 to 34 years old are more likely to sext than those in other age groups. Anxious parents might think that sexting leads to a slew of negative consequences like early and risky sexual behavior. But there is evidence to suggest this is not the case. The proportion of American adolescents who are sexually active has declined in recent years (though the rates are still high and warrant concern). Adolescent pregnancy rates have also declined over the last two decades, perhaps due to more teenagers using contraception. Sexting is not related to riskier sexual behaviors like having unprotected sex. About the only thing sexting is related to is sexual activity — adolescents who are sexually active are more likely to sext. Sexting doesn't indicate a significant change in teenage sexual behaviors; it just makes teenage sexual behaviors more visible to adults. Sexting can help adolescents discover their sexual identity, something that is developmentally appropriate in the teenage years, whether they are sexting or not. But sexting is not without problems. Because laws have not yet caught up with the realities of technology use, in some states, a minor could potentially be charged under child pornography laws for sexting. There are a few, rare instances when this has happened. In these cases, there is usually quite a bit of backlash against prosecutors attempting to indict minors under child pornography laws. Seventeen states have created legislation that either decriminalizes sexting or makes it a misdemeanor. States like Florida and Vermont make the creation, possession, or sending of a nude image of a minor by a minor a non-criminal violation for the first offense. That being said, there is nothing stopping an overzealous prosecutor in another state from making an example of a teenager and charging him with the most severe penalty possible. The social consequences of sexting are more troubling. Messages shared in confidence can be shared with other people or broadcast to a wider audience. Luckily, this doesn't happen often. One study found only 2% of sexters had their photo shared with someone they didn't want to see it. Although it's unlikely, imagine how future employers might evaluate your daughter if they Google her and find a sexually explicit image. What is more likely is that your teenage daughter's peers will share and shame her for the image. In the worst cases, sexting can lead to tragedy. Thirteen-year-old Hope Witsell sexted a photo to her boyfriend. Somehow, a classmate got hold of the photo and passed it around. Before you know it, the photo went viral. Witsell committed suicide reportedly after repeated bullying and taunts from other students who called her names like ""slut"" or ""whore."" Eighteen-year-old Jessica Logan also committed suicide reportedly after her boyfriend circulated a nude picture of her that was meant to be seen in confidence. These cases are heartbreaking. They show that we must educate young people, especially young men, about how harmful such acts can be. And as a society, we must do more to raise awareness and combat bullying and cyberbullying. If sexting is not abused and done discretely, it is an acceptable form of exploration of sexual identity, especially for adolescents. You can talk about sexting as a way to talk with your teenage son or daughter about safe sex. Once you have established a good rapport, explain the pitfalls of sexting — that if they're not careful, nude images of them can be shared with the whole world and used to harm their reputations. Adolescents are naturally impulsive because the teenage brain is still developing the ability to self-regulate. Try to be understanding and keep your cool. Remember: Sexting is the ultimate form of safe sex — the sender and receiver are not even in the same room.","Rey Junco: American society has a double standard when it comes to sexuality .

"(CNN)Yet another war in the Middle East could bring devastation and tremendous international repercussions. So many people around the globe breathed a sign of relief Thursday as word broke that Hezbollah said it does not want to further escalate hostilities against Israel. Still, after a high-profile missile strike by Israel, days of missile attacks by the Lebanese militant group, and exchanges of fire, tensions are high. The possibility remains that a full-scale military confrontation could erupt -- as it did in 2006 . While regional politics are at play, numerous other major factors are as well -- including oil prices, ISIS, Iran's nuclear dispute with the West and the threat of Hezbollah terrorist attacks around the world. Here's a look at what's happening. This week, Hezbollah fired five anti-tank missiles at Israeli military vehicles near the Lebanese border, killing two soldiers and wounding seven others. Israel also evacuated a town that includes a popular ski resort following Hezbollah attacks in the region. In skirmishes that followed, a Spanish service member with the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon was killed. It's unclear whether he was killed by Hezbollah or Israeli fire, the United Nations said. Spain's U.N. Ambassador Roman Oyarzun Marchesi said the violence ""resulted from the rocket attacks launched by Hezbollah"" and ""the artillery fire which followed."" When asked whose fire killed the peacekeeper, Marchesi said ""it was because of the escalation of violence and it came from the Israeli side."" But the next day, Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, said, ""The precise cause of death is as yet undetermined and remains the subject of investigation."" All this follows an Israeli airstrike last week in the Syrian town of Quneitra that killed six Hezbollah operatives and at least one member of Iran's Revolutionary Guard. Iran state media said Gen. Mohammad  Ali Allahdadi was killed, but the Jerusalem Post reported that six Iranian commanders were killed. ""The attack delivered perhaps the highest-profile blow to Hezbollah and Iranian interests in Syria since the outbreak of war there,"" Phillip Smyth wrote on ForeignPolicy.com. Among those killed was Jihad Mughniyeh. In his 20s, he was the son of one of Hezbollah's founders, Imad Mughniyeh, who was killed in a 2008 bombing in Damascus, Syria.  Jihad Mughniyeh's death ""represented a symbolic blow to the Shi'ite Islamist group that his father helped to found with Iranian backing in the early 1980s,"" the Jerusalem Post reported. Although Hezbollah is based in Lebanon, it is aligned with and supports the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Iran supports both the Syrian regime and Hezbollah as well. The fighting has been taking place in the region in which Lebanon and Syria border the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights. The Israeli tank that was struck was in Shebaa Farms, also known as Har Dov, a disputed strip of land. Neither Israel nor Hezbollah wants the situation to spiral into a war, analysts say. ""I think Israel's trying to defend its borders"" and is concerned about attacks from ""a well-known terrorist group"" across the border, said Matthew Levitt, author of the 2013 book ""Hezbollah: The Global Footprint of Lebanon's Party of God."" In Hezbollah, there are elements that would like to escalate, said Levitt, director of the counterterrorism program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. But ""the attack against the Israeli patrol really does appear calculated to minimize response. You don't have a force going into Israel proper, you don't have the attempts to snatch bodies,"" he said. In 2006, war broke out after Hezbollah militants crossed into Israel, killing three soldiers and kidnapping two others, then killed another five Israeli soldiers. Timeline: Decades of conflict in Lebanon, Israel . Hezbollah has many of its fighters at war in Syria on behalf of al-Assad. But the group has others available to carry out attacks against Israel. And it felt it had to respond to last week's Israeli airstrike on Quneitra, sending a message to ""its community and its constituency,"" said Levitt. Iran felt the same way. Tehran viewed the Quneitra attack as ""crossing a line that warrants a response,"" said Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council and author of ""A Single Roll of the Dice: Obama's Diplomacy with Iran."" All this is taking place against a backdrop of negotiations between Iran and Western powers over its nuclear activities. The Israel-Hezbollah dispute comes ""at a pivotal time for the nuclear talks in a way that is not helpful for the U.S. or Iran,"" Parsi said. Depending on how the nuclear talks go, Iran may show restraint -- or the situation may escalate further, he said. Iran needs to make sure the situation cools down, said Michael Rubin, a former Pentagon official now at the American Enterprise Institute. ""Iran can't afford to let the fighting between Hezbollah and Israel get out of hand as it did in 2006,"" he said. More than 1,000 people on the Lebanese side and more than 150 on the Israeli side died in the war. ""Most scenarios involving an Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear program involve a simultaneous push into Lebanon to blunt Hezbollah's ability to retaliate and fire missiles into Israel. If Israel and Hezbollah's skirmish descends into war and Hezbollah rocket fire, then the Israelis might figure in for a penny, in for a pound"" -- in other words, fighting back against Hezbollah might mean going after Iran's nuclear sites. ""If things escalate to the point where Hezbollah starts firing missiles at Israeli cities, then Israel might figure that's as good a green light as any to get the job done,"" Rubin said. (Tehran insists it only wants nuclear energy; Western nations, including the United States, and Israel believe Iran seeks nuclear weaponry.) The Israel-Hezbollah dynamic also has implications for the fight against the ISIS terror network. The United States and Iran both oppose ISIS. U.S. officials have opened channels of communication with Iran over it. (""U.S. and Iran Both Attack ISIS, but Try Not to Look Like Allies,"" read a New York Times headline.) The fighting between Hezbollah -- a Shiite militant group -- and Israel ""should highlight the dangers of relying on Iran against Sunni extremists like ISIS. Rather than bring stability or security, Hezbollah's actions show that the U.S. would simply be swapping one flavor of extremism for another,"" Rubin said. Another piece of the puzzle is the oil market. The drop in oil prices is hurting Iran, Hezbollah's sponsor. ""The Iranians spent a lot of money helping Hezbollah repair Lebanon in the wake of the 2006 war. Price of oil going down, stretched in Syria, Iran is simply not flush and I don't think wants it this time around,""  former U.S. State Department official Aaron David Miller, now with the Wilson Center, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. Iran is also struggling from sanctions over its nuclear activities and is ""funneling billions of dollars to the Syrian regime,"" the Christian Science Monitor reports.  Hezbollah has had to tighten its belt. But there's another way Hezbollah can flex its muscle: through further terrorist attacks elsewhere in the world, said Levitt. The group has a long history of attacks overseas, including one at the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, in 1983 that killed 241 Americans. Bulgaria found Hezbollah was behind an attack on a bus that killed five Israeli tourists in 2012. Peru reported thwarting a bomb attempt late last year. Authorities announced they would press charges against a man who confessed to being a member of Hezbollah, Reuters reported. Ever since the militant group's military chief Imad Mughniyeh was killed in the 2008 bombing, Hezbollah has been trying to carry out new terrorist attacks around the world in response, Levitt said.","Israel and Hezbollah have stepped up fighting in recent days .
Neither side wants a full-scale war, analysts believe .
Iran, oil, ISIS and more all play into the scenario ."
"(CNN) -- Powered by ferocious winds, Typhoon Hagupit is whipping towards central Philippines and could affect the same area hit by the deadly Typhoon Haiyan just 13 months ago, several forecasts show. With winds gusting up to 172 miles per hour (277 kilometers per hour), the strongest storm of 2014 could slam into the Philippines, a country of more than 92 million people all too familiar with destructive weather. Forecasters don't know exactly where Hagupit, or Ruby as it's known in the Philippines, will make landfall. But local authorities estimate that about 44 provinces, home to 35 million people could be in the storm's projected path. Typhoons are compared in terms of intensity, wind speeds, gusts, rainfall and, for the people in their path, homes and lives lost, and dollars and time needed to rebuild. Super Typhoon Haiyan, or Yolanda as it was known locally, which struck in 2013, was recorded as the strongest tropical cyclone ever to make landfall anywhere in the world in recorded history. What's in a name? Typhoons and hurricanes are both tropical cyclones, but they assume different names, depending on their location. Typhoons form in the northwest Pacific Ocean, west of the international date line. They become Super Typhoons if they reach maximum sustained 1-minute surface winds of at least 240 kilometers per hour (150 mph, or 130 knots), according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A Super Typhoon is the equivalent of a strong Category 4 or 5 hurricane in the Atlantic, or a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone in the Australian basin. The Philippines is in the firing line of typhoons, for a number of reasons. In Tacloban, children ripped from arms . Path of destruction . The Philippines sits on the western rim of the Pacific Ocean, the most active area for tropical cyclones because of the vast expanse of deep, warm ocean water. The country comprises more than 7,000 islands, leaving plenty of exposed coast at the mercy of wind and rain. More than 92 million people live there, most of them outside the capital, Manila, where 12 million people are packed into one of the most densely populated cities in the world. Last year, Super Typhoon Haiyan made landfall south of the capital, while most people were sleeping, about 4:30 a.m. The devastating storm killed more than 6,000 people as it crashed into the Eastern Visayas region where it severely devastated the city of Tacloban, and then struck the Central Visayas. Frequency . An average of eight or nine tropical cyclones make landfall in the Philippines each year. Eleven typhoons have affected the country this year, compared with the record of 19 that smashed into the coast in 1993, according to PAGASA, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration. The Philippines is covered in mountains, which drop sharply to coastal areas, increasing the risk of devastating landslides. Storm surges are also a risk along the populated coasts. Despite the frequency of violent storms, many of the buildings are not built to withstand a heavy battering from strong wind and rain. Over the last decade, the Philippines has consistently ranked in the top five most disaster-hit countries -- along with China, the United States, India and Indonesia -- according to the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, or CRED. High costs . By international standards, the Philippines may be showing strong annual economic growth, but it's one of the poorest countries in the world, ranking 165th in GDP per capita, according to the CIA World Factbook. In 2013, GDP per capita was $4,700. Any natural disasters deal a hefty blow to the country's finances. The cost of Super Typhoon Haiyan reached over $13 billion, according to some estimates. It was by far the biggest natural disaster to hit the country in terms of the number of people affected and the total cost of damage, according to the International Disaster Database. CNN's Madison Park contributed to this report.","The Philippines is one of the most disaster-hit countries in the world .

"(CNN)CNN Senior International Correspondent Nick Paton Walsh spent two days in the Kobani, Syria, covering the heavy fighting between Kurdish forces and ISIS militants that has devastated the city. Thousands of civilians still live in the city, either unwilling or unable to flee. Paton Walsh described his experiences -- including meeting a group of children who played in a makeshift graveyard and hid under cushions to protect themselves from ISIS shelling -- in an ask me anything chat on Reddit. Here are  the highlights from the hourlong conversation. Some of the posts have been edited for grammar and clarity. Q: ""I'm sure you saw and experienced a lot of devastating things in your time over there. What was the most heartbreaking thing you saw? Do you think outside/foreign involvement over there is having more of a positive or negative impact on the people?"" asked smedynski. Paton Walsh: ""The kids in their cushion shelter is always tough. I also remember a bomb shelter some kids made -- two years ago now -- in a refugee camp in Bab al Salama. They were literally digging a cave with their hands. Foreign help comes in many forms. ISIS have some foreigners. The Turkish are just across the border, but the Kurds claim they are impeding resupply. The Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga help a lot with heavy weapons. And the coalition airstrikes also keep ISIS back and have helped the Kurds hang on. But in the end the sheer volume of outside parties now with stakes in the fight for the town means that it will go on a long time."" Q: ""Hi Nick, amazing report from Kobani - how long were you there and how did you get in?"" asked SuzanneLavery. Paton Walsh: ""Thanks. We were there just under 48 hours. I can't really say much about how we got in -- it was a mix of simple and complicated -- but we are grateful to the Kurds for their hospitality and care."" Q: ""What's the current situation for journalists there? Interested to know about how you get your stories out, how you manage the day to day?"" asked ithinkandroid . ""Thank you in advance."" Paton Walsh: ""It is complicated. Anyone attempting entry should spend weeks thinking about it, and not file until out. Day to day, you need the full invitation and hospitality of the Kurds to operate in any way."" Q: ""Did you feel safe under the Kurds care and hospitality?"" asked monhen. Paton Walsh:  Yes, as safe as one can there. Q: You probably aren't allowed to answer this, but, I'll ask anyways. ""How does your personal understanding and experience being there, seeing things, and working there differ from what is ultimately reported? Perhaps it doesn't? Or, maybe it does? In either case, I am curious to hear your thoughts. And, thanks for taking the time to do this AMA!"" asked rurd. Paton Walsh: ""It's the same. There isn't some process by which we see and feel a lot of things that we then ignore and follow a preordained script. You see what we do. I know that's hard to believe in this social media age of micro-digestion, but it's true."" Q: ""Did you interview any ISIS members?"" asked shouldbeworking23. Paton Walsh: ""The nature of ISIS means that in person you are unlikely -- or ill-advised -- to interview them. Social media interaction and Skype are possible -- and my colleagues have managed that. The Kurds did not have any ISIS prisoners at the time we were inside Kobani."" Q: ""Thank you and your team for being professionals and risking your lives for the story. Did you meet any foreign nationals fighting for the Kurdish side? Is there any truth to the reports of ISIS getting resupplied from the Turkish side of the border? How effective do you think are the allied airstrikes on ISIS? And last but not least, have you ever touched Wolf Blitzer's beard? Again, thank you."" asked Rihannas_forehead. Paton Walsh: ""No, no foreign nationals. We were told there may be some, but saw none. ISIS are not, as far as we can see, getting any resupply -- the Turkish are in a bind as they are both presumably trying to not end up in an open fight with ISIS, whilst securing their own borders. The coalition airstrikes are being effective in terms of denying ISIS the chance to take all of Kobani. The strikes have also meant ISIS have had to pour in and lose fighters and equipment. They can't finish the fight off, though. That will take better equipping for the Kurds. Wolf's beard is off limits. Period."" Q: ""Hey Nick. What do you see as the best solution for the situation in Syria right now? Any ideas how to remove Assad from power (if that is even the best way to go about reaching some level of peace)?"" asked ceclimber22. Paton Walsh: ""You can't tackle ISIS without also addressing the reason why such extremism has a constituency -- the three years of massacres of Sunnis that Assad forces perpetrated. but an overall solution for Syria is outside of the resources the U.S. wants to commit at this point. there are also too many other players who want an opposite outcome -- Iran/Russia. the U.S. should be, and perhaps has been, mindful that their increased presence -- like ground troops -- has often become the lightning rod for all anger -- adding a new problem rather than fixing the original one. In end, Syria is going to be a conflict that tires of itself. One key problem is that this war has become a proxy conflict for many sides and keeps expanding -- dragging in Iraq, and more different militias. So the point in which the combatants get exhausted keeps staying out of reach. It will take a singular seismic event that prompts serious international action, or more likely eventual exhaustion, to stop this war."" Q: ""What are your thoughts on the CIA ISIS torture videos released yesterday? Do you think the videos will provoke ISIS to expedite their attacks on U.S. soil? Also, from your perspective, how concerned should we be in regards to ISIS growth? The news reports they're growing rapidly was this evident during your time in Syria?"" asked Britney_Lewin. Paton Walsh: ""ISIS grew most rapidly when they were not on the global radar, and then when they ran into Iraq, taking Mosul. Since then, their victories have been incremental. They haven't had the huge storming win they need for recruitment -- the constant forward motion that many analysts say makes them attractive to future recruits. They are growing in terms of infrastructure and organization perhaps, but not geographical reach -- if you exclude a handful of pledges of allegiance in other countries that are symbolically worrying, but not game-changers."" Q: ""Does ISIS/ISIL actually consider the term 'Daesh' as offensive? I have only seen the one report by ""residents"" in Mosul saying that the fighters and leadership see it as offensive. Will renaming them, across all fronts, actually do anything? Thanks!"" asked zib_al-jihad. Paton Walsh: ""I don't think renaming them Daesh makes any difference. It might mildly annoy those who watch French politicians on TV. But in the end, a slightly more forcible strategy is required than intellectualized name-calling."" Q: ""If you could tell the American public just one thing about ISIS, what would it be?"" asked oHolo. Paton Walsh: ""A decade of policies in the Middle East helped create them. You need to help find and fund the solution, or it will become a problem on your soil, not just the Middle East."" READ: Inside Kobani, scenes of devastation on every side .

"The terrifying news began to spread before the gun-wielding Islamist militants made it into Chibok last month.  Villagers began to receive cell phone calls that the feared extremist group Boko Haram was on the way. No one knew what the attack would entail, that it would mean hundreds of schoolgirls plucked from their beds by a group of extremists who would later threaten to sell them. ""It's like they were coming for a shopping trip,"" a villager who witnessed the attack told CNN. Some lucky girls managed to escape that night when, after they were loaded into cargo trucks, they made a dash for freedom. ""We would rather  die than go,"" one of the girls told CNN. ""We ran into the bush. We ran and we ran."" With fear in her eyes and voice, the young woman, who asked not to be identified, described the experience to a CNN crew that made the long, dangerous trip to her village. She said she and two friends who had also escaped saw something on fire and headed in that direction, presuming it was building in the village that had been set ablaze. Normally, Chibok is pitch black at night. Boko Haram abducted an estimated 276 girls in April from a boarding school in Chibok. Dozens escaped, but more than 200 are still missing. Villagers said they passed along warnings to local police that the terrorists were on their way that night. They said they received phone calls from family and friends from surrounding villages and were told that there was a convoy of cargo trucks, pickups and motorcycles heading their way. One villager said he was told, ""They are coming for you. Run!"" The villagers said police called for reinforcements, but none came. Everyone, including the police, fled into the bush during the attack. But the girls were asleep in their dorms. The stories appear to confirm an Amnesty International report that the government couldn't put together enough troops to head off the attack. The girl who described her escape to CNN was still shaken up by the events. When asked to describe what her kidnappers wore, she responded: ""I feel afraid."" Her school is closed, but if it were open, she says, she wouldn't go back.","Villagers say they were warned that attackers were coming, but police did nothing .

"(CNN) -- As the United States gears up for possible airstrikes inside Syria, it should remember one thing: No matter how much planning has gone into U.S. military plans to counter the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the Arab public isn't convinced that anything will change. Indeed, a look at Arab social and online media reveals something quite different: The more blistering the rhetoric from Washington, the more the region's bloggers and Facebook users burst into laughter. This week, diplomats and leaders met in Paris to discuss the ISIS threat, a meeting that came a week after President Barack Obama's speech outlining the U.S. strategy to defeat the group. The prevailing view in the Arab world seems to be that the President's address was long on rhetoric and short on ideas for constructive action. Why this conclusion? More than three years into Syria's civil war, the United States has lost credibility after standing by as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad bombed and killed his own people, including the widely believed use of chemical weapons. After drawing a red line, Obama stepped back from military action, saying he needed the approval of Congress. He used similar rhetoric in his speech last week. In the newspaper Asharq al-Awsat, Abdulrahman al-Rashed spoke for many when he wrote: ""Truth be told, regional states have been calling on the international community -- particularly the United States -- for two years, asking them to cooperate in confronting these dangerous groups. Unfortunately, the White House has rejected these appeals. ... (T)he U.S. president was eventually forced to act following international pressure and after the atrocities committed by (ISIS) became too much to ignore."" Arab intellectuals recognize that over the last 30 years Islamist groups have been defeated only after local populations rejected their ideologies and violence. They understand that conventional military intervention and drone strikes are unlikely to eradicate ISIS, and that although ISIS has made enemies, it also could not have made its dramatic gains without at least tacit support from local populations. The United States exacerbated the problem of not winning over locals by upping and leaving before the political task had been completed. ""ISIS would not have become such a strong and widespread entity if the U.S. hadn't pulled its troops from Iraq prior to addressing certain issues: Sunnis regaining their rights and dignity, limiting Iran's interference, and completely eradicating al Qaeda,"" commentator Saleh Al Qalab wrote. He is far from alone in this thinking. Many Sunni Arabs blame the United States not only for invading Iraq and creating fertile ground for extremism in the first place, but then making things worse by throwing its support behind the Shiite-led government of Nuri al-Maliki, whose sectarian leadership marginalized Sunnis. Remember, the earlier iteration of ISIS was al Qaeda in Iraq, which was responsible for a considerable share of the sectarian violence that swept the country after the U.S. invasion. ""Only idiots cannot see that ISIS was created by the Americans,"" Omar Dhahir argued in the Arab Times. ""It was the only way for it to regain the strength and influence it had lost in the Middle East. A closer look at the media indicates that ISIS is present everywhere, in countries where the U.S. has vested interests, but not in the U.S. itself. ... U.S. policy was never ethical or humane but it has now reached unprecedented levels of lack of shame."" Such condemnation has also found its voice through cartoonists and satirists who believe world powers are, quite frankly, impotent in the face of the militant group. Karl Sharro, a London-based Syrian commentator, came up with some humorous takes on the warnings emanating from leaders in Berlin and Paris -- ""We will hit ISIS on the nose with a big sausage and laugh loudly,"" he mused as an apt quote for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, and, ""We will smack ISIS on the head and then push them in a puddle of mud,"" for French President FranÃ§ois Hollande. Cartoons in the Arabic media have been just as scathing. One of the most popular shows Obama reaching his hand out to an injured Arab, telling him he wants to cooperate with the Islamic world. But the Arab in the cartoon is unable to shake hands because one arm has been severed at the elbow and his other arm is in a sling due to an injury sustained in Iraq. The message is clear: The United States has created so much violence in the region that there is no longer anyone still standing with whom it could effectively work. True -- officially at least -- some Arab governments have been a little more enthusiastic about the U.S. cause. Ten Arab nations signed up last week to join the fight against ISIS. But such vows are likely to meet a weary shrug of the shoulders among much of the public. As far as many are concerned, ISIS isn't go anywhere soon.","Arab public doesn't have faith in U.S. military strategy for countering ISIS, authors say .
View is that President Obama's speech on ISIS was long on rhetoric, short on ideas, they say .

"It's a good thing Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart doesn't have an Internet connection. If he could see what happened to Zachary De Pue this week, he might turn over in his grave. A video is going viral of violin virtuoso De Pue stranded on the tarmac of Charlotte, North Carolina's airport Monday, playing his heart out in indignation -- on a priceless violin. His fiddle is worth more than $250,000. It's the reason De Pue, the Concertmaster of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra, didn't make the plane. A flight attendant on the US Airways flight to Fayetteville, Arkansas, wouldn't let De Pue take the precious violin on board with him. He insisted he turn the sensitive instrument in as checked baggage. For De Pue, it was out of the question that the violin be tossed into the cargo bay. He did not mention which violin he was carrying. But according to the orchestra's website and that of the band he was traveling with Monday, De Pue plays a violin made by master luthier Ferdinand Gagliano in 1757, the year after Mozart was born. Time for Three . De Pue and fellow violinist Nick Kendall are part of a string trio called Time for Three, along with bassist Ranaan Meyer, whom they were on their way to meet. Kendall was also carrying a valuable violin on board, but neither could convince the crew that their precious cargo would fit in the overhead bins. The pilot apologized, Kendall said, and told them the FAA mandates that musical instruments cannot be carried on the plane. If federal agents discovered a violation, a fine of $10,000 would follow. The two got off the plane. Cap, T-shirt, jogging pants . The youthful looking De Pue told HLN's Right this Minute that he didn't feel they were being taken seriously. Standing on the tarmac in his Ninja Turtles T-shirt and jogging pants, with a baseball cap on backward, his appearance was a far cry from the cliché of an elegantly dressed Concertmaster. But De Pue is used to breaking the mold with his trio, especially musically. On their historic string instruments, they love to stroke out country music, bluegrass and jazz, or improvise their own hybrids in jam sessions. De Pue decided to appeal to the pilot's ears, and whipped out the invaluable violin. ""Film this man,"" he told Kendall, who pulled out a cell phone. ""I'm going to play for them, and maybe that will get their attention."" The intention was clear -- online retribution. ""We're gonna post this. This is gonna be something that everybody talks about,"" Kendall said. De Pue's agile bow and nimble fingers toned out a classical aria over the blunting roar of the jet engines, as the last of the crew boarded. Rectifying rules . The music touched the right ears. US Airways put the two on a later flight with their precious instruments as carry-ons and issued a mea culpa. ""We sincerely apologize for not only their delay, but what occurred at the airport,"" said Bill McGlashen, a spokesman for US Airways. He cited varying regulations as the reason the two could not carry the instruments aboard the first flight, but were allowed to take them on the second. It wasn't the last run-in De Pue and Kendall would have over the priceless violins. On the next flight they took, the same thing nearly happened again, De Pue and Kendall said,when a ticket agent asked them to turn in their instruments as checked baggage. But this time, they were prepared. They had studied  FAA regulations and found a 2012 adjustment in the rules, the FAA Modernization and Reform Act. It allowed them to carry their instruments on board, they said. They showed the regulations to the agent, they said. It did the trick. The customer service blues: Going viral with complaints .

"Airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS targeted the Islamist rebel group Ahrar al Sham for the first time overnight in Syria, a monitoring group said Thursday. One airstrike hit the headquarters for Ahrar al Sham in Babsaqa, Idlib province, near the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Activist video and photos from the scene claimed to show a large explosion and a building blown into rubble. Ahrar al Sham is a Sunni Muslim group that is not on the U.S. list of designated terrorist organizations and so far has not been hit by coalition airstrikes. One of the more conservative Sunni militant groups in the rebel alliance, Ahrar al Sham has members that sometimes fight alongside the al Qaeda-affiliated Islamist militant group Jabhat al-Nusra, but against ISIS. They are not linked to al Qaeda, have not pledged allegiance to al Qaeda, and are not named as a terror group by the United States. There are mixed opinions on how radical the group is, mostly because its entire leadership was killed in a September blast and the new leadership's intentions are not yet clear, although some observers anticipate a more radical direction. This may have prompted concern in some quarters that it could become more closely allied to Jabhat al-Nusra, also known as al-Nusra Front, which has been gaining ground in Syria. However, Ahrar members are also seen by many Syrians as moderates who protect them -- and these strikes, if they did hit Ahrar, risk again confirming the idea that the United States is seeking to benefit the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Report: Children hit in strike . The U.S.-led coalition carried out other airstrikes overnight Wednesday to Thursday, including one apparently targeting a vehicle belonging to al-Nusra in Sarmada, a town also in Idlib province on the border with Turkey. Video posted by activists purported to show a car in flames on the street in Sarmada while people watched it burn. The coalition also struck the headquarters of al-Nusra Front in the city of Harim, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said, with initial reports indicating that two children were killed and other people were injured. Photos posted by activists claimed to show the bodies of two young children covered in dust with severe injuries, along with other men being treated by doctors in a clinic. CNN has not independently verified the images. Like ISIS, al-Nusra Front is trying to establish an Islamic state, though primarily in Syria. It has emerged as one of the most effective groups fighting the Syrian regime, drawing on foreign fighters with combat experience in Iraq and elsewhere. At least six militants from al-Nusra were also killed in a U.S.-led coalition airstrike in the western part of Aleppo, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Thursday, citing reliable sources in the embattled city in northwestern Syria. The airstrike also caused massive damage to the group's local headquarters in an area known as al-Muhameen, in the western Aleppo countryside, according to the monitoring group. U.S. official: Khorasan bomb-maker targeted . A senior U.S. military official told CNN Thursday that all strikes around Idlib on Wednesday night targeted the Khorasan Group. There were no strikes targeting al-Nusra or any other group, he said. According to a U.S. defense official who has access to the latest information about the strikes, a key French jihadist belonging to the Khorasan Group was killed in one of them. The United States fired at a vehicle it believes was carrying David Drugeon, a skilled Khorasan bomb-maker who also has  ties to core al Qaeda members in Pakistan. U.S. intelligence agencies believe Drugeon has facilitated the movement of European jihadists to Syria and back to Europe, raising worries they could then travel to the United States. Drugeon traveled to Syria in the last two years from Pakistan, where he worked with al Qaeda. There were a total of five strikes against Khorasan targets near Idlib, the official said, using both drones and fighter aircraft. The official could not say which type of aircraft struck Drugeon's vehicle. The United States has been searching for top Khorasan leaders since it determined initial strikes against the group in September failed to kill its main leadership. In the wake of the strikes against the Khorasan Group in September, U.S. Central Command spoke of ""action to disrupt the imminent attack plotting against the United States and Western interests."" The group was formed by senior al Qaeda members based in Pakistan who traveled to Syria to direct operations, CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen reported, citing British and U.S. officials. ""Khorasan"" is an ancient term for an Islamic empire. Obama administration could expand Syria mission . Analyst: Targeting Ahrar could backfire . If Ahrar al Sham has been targeted -- rather than another target being sought that happened to be in Ahrar's headquarters, or the strike being a targeting blunder -- it could be a complex matter for U.S. policy, while also raising the specter of so-called mission creep. ""If Ahrar has indeed been targeted, it may well have deeply damaging consequences in terms of Syrians' perception of U.S. objectives in their country,"" said Charles Lister, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center and a leading expert on ISIS and Syria. ""For many opposition Syrians, targeting ISIS makes sense, targeting Nusra is unpopular, but targeting a group like Ahrar, despite their conservative base, would undoubtedly backfire. ""Unfortunately, it would seem that the U.S.-led coalition is still in reaction mode -- each mistake will force more reaction, but all the time, our objectives are getting further and further from us."" According to Lister, Ahrar has been going through a significant process of top-down moderation over the past nine months, with considerable consequences for the group's willingness to compromise on political objectives. ""If it's been done, adding Ahrar onto the list of coalition targets threatens to reverse this moderating process, to the detriment of international interests,"" he said of the apparent targeting of the group.","U.S. defense official says Khorasan Group bomb-maker was killed in an airstrike .

"On the southern fringes of Donetsk, in the shadow of a huge steel plant, a cacophony of barking overwhelms the dull thud of artillery fire.

Many are orphans of the conflict that has shaken this city for the past six months. Their owners have left or in a few cases been killed by the shelling. Some have been discovered tied up and emaciated; others carry the scars of shrapnel or hobble around on three legs. There are several in every cage, with a handful of straw to protect them from temperatures that plunge far below freezing at night. The director of the sanctuary is Victoria Vasilieva, a tall middle-aged woman with jet black hair, whose compassion for the animals in her care is unstinting. She cradles a young dog called Jennifer, the only survivor when a shell hit her family's home near the airport. Jennifer was found traumatized in the ruins and it has taken weeks to gain her trust. Vasilieva says that the dogs here used to be terrified by the sounds of war. Now, like the people of Donetsk, they hardly notice them. Inside the office block, a puppy -- mostly black Labrador - is recovering from a broken leg and shrapnel wound. Vats of oatmeal are cooking in the yard. It's like feeding an army. A few very lucky dogs are going to new homes in Germany, Finland and Russia, but the great majority will remain at the shelter so long as there is money to feed them. The staff and volunteers at PIF are struggling to cope with the sudden influx, but the dogs here are a small fraction of the number now roaming the city, sleeping in bombed-out stores and the ruins of apartment blocks. Some run in packs, hungry and cold, as the long winter nights set in. PIF runs a sterilization program, but there are literally thousands of dogs on the streets -- and some residents worry they will turn vicious as they grow more desperate -- as if the people here didn't have enough to worry about already. Vasilieva says she has enough money to see the shelter through to the end of the year. Much of the center's funding comes from one of Ukraine's richest men, Rinat Akhmetov, a native of Donetsk who has moved to Kiev after falling out with those running the Donetsk People's Republic, which is now in firm control of the city. Not far from the shelter, his foundation is also providing food aid to the city's neediest people. The people -- especially the elderly -- and the animals of Donetsk are in a common struggle to survive. Old women, their faces creased by decades of endurance and hardship, still find a few scraps for dogs on the streets. Some share what little food they have with pets. But life here is getting tougher by the day: pensioners scrounge up coins worth less than one US cent in an effort to buy bread; some of the handful of supermarkets still open have imposed a limit on how many coins they will accept. Heating, electricity and water supplies are intermittent. Inflation is accelerating because there are few safe routes in and out of the city and produce is more difficult to transport. The U.N. World Food Programme has distributed food vouchers to some 10,000 internally displaced people in the Donetsk region and aims to reach 120,000 people over the next six months. But the Ukrainian government estimates that some 450,000 people are displaced. And many of those who are not -- who cannot flee the fighting -- are in just as much need. The Ukrainian government has decided to stop paying pensions, state salaries and other benefits in areas held by the separatists. Some people in Donetsk are traveling to nearby government-held cities like Mariupol to try to register for their pensions, but such trips bring risk and expense. The self-declared Donetsk People's Republic says it is setting up a pension fund, but when and from where the money will come is unknown. There is still money in Donetsk, once a relatively prosperous city built on manufacturing and steel. But it is concentrated in a few hands. Most of those who have stayed -- or who came back when the ceasefire was signed in September -- have received no income for months. The full extent of the elderly's plight is laid out on the sidewalks near Donetsk's railway station. In temperatures below freezing on Saturday morning, a clutch of women -- and a few men -- stood over a few possessions, worth next to nothing, in the forlorn hope that someone would buy something. All of them appeared to be at least sixty. It was a pathetic scene. On offer: clothes hangers, chipped mugs, half-used tubes of medication, a Ricky Martin song book, a couple of screws and some nails. In nearly half an hour, we saw nothing sold. And the refrain from the street sellers was the same: ""I don't know how we are going to survive.""","Shelter on the outskirts of Donetsk is home to almost 1,000 dogs .

"Cairo (CNN)Two men exchange rings and hug in celebration aboard a Nile boat, as ululations fill the air and a traditional engagement song plays in the background. But within days, their celebration has turned to shock and sadness: after a video of the ""gay wedding"" spread across Egyptian social media, the men were arrested and eventually sentenced to three years in prison for distributing pornographic material. Homosexuality is not mentioned in the Egyptian penal code, and technically it is not illegal, but members of the LGBT community are often arrested and charged with pornography, prostitution or debauchery. At least 20 homosexual and transgender persons were convicted of debauchery and other charges in 2014, which human rights activists say has been the worst year for the community in recent memory. Fear of arrest and social stigma force the majority of the LGBT community to conceal their identity and sexual orientation. ""You have to be aware of everything you're doing; your clothes, your reactions toward people,"" Nour told CNN. He has asked us not to use his real name to protect his identity. Both dominant religions in Egypt, Islam and Christianity, prohibit homosexuality. Rather than the literal translation, the word usually used for homosexuality in Arabic is ""shezoz"", meaning ""abnormality."" This category is wide enough to lump together homosexuals and transgender people as one, in both media reports and court cases. A video posted on a popular news portal last May showed five people after their arrest at a residential apartment; their faces, like their bodies, barely covered. Two weeks later, they were sentenced to 12, seven and four years in prison. Among the charges they faced was that of using the internet to spread debauchery. ""The police would make the defendants go through their contacts and the pictures they post on [dating apps and social media] to use them as evidence against them and get information on others,"" says Dalia Abd Elhameed, gender and women's rights officer at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. Earlier this year, a group of rights activists reached out to gay dating websites urging them to issue safety warnings to their Egyptian users. Grindr, a gay dating application, warned their Egyptian users that ""police may be posing as LGBT on social media to entrap you.""  In September, Grindr announced that locations would be hidden by default for users in countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Russia, which have a history of prosecuting those from the LGBT community. ""I'm always afraid if I meet someone and he is from the government then I'll get arrested like other people,"" Nour said. Such fears encompass both the humiliation of having one's identity revealed, and the prospect of coming face-to-face with an unclear judicial procedure. The verdicts in such court cases, Abd Elhameed said, were often illogical. ""Take the [wedding] case for example: The judge cleared them of the debauchery charges, yet he sentenced them to three years for filming and distributing pornographic material, even though he ruled that there was no debauchery involved."" A forensic report from the court found that the men hadn't engaged in homosexual intercourse. ""I think the police will not treat them as humans. This is a very big problem in Egypt,"" said psychiatrist Dr. Wa'el Abu Hendy. He says he supports gay rights, but he also has another view:  ""My thought about this is that this is something that can be changed, can be corrected,"" says Abu Hendy. ""Of course there are those who cannot be cured but we have had many successes with the treatment."" That view is widely discredited by leading physiological experts in the West. In 2009, the American Psychological Association (APA) recommended that specialists avoid telling clients that sexual orientation is changeable through therapy or other forms of treatment. It warned of ""the potential for harm,"" stressing the lack of proof that such types of therapy can lead to a permanent change in sexual orientation. The APA called into question Hendy's practices. ""Contrary to claims of sexual orientation change advocates and practitioners, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of psychological interventions to change sexual orientation,"" said Judith M. Glassgold, chair of the task force that created the APA report. Abu Hendy claims those expert findings are the result of pressure from the LGBT lobby. But Nour said such ""change"" attempts were nonsense. ""My father took me to a psychiatrist once and he gave me this medical thing that actually makes you stop having any sexual feelings but doesn't cure you. Know what I mean? So it's bulls***."" In the majority of Egypt's film productions over the decades, homosexuals are stereotypically portrayed as overtly flamboyant and part of criminal or prostitution rings. ""Family Secrets"", a film released earlier this year, was ground-breaking in having a gay protagonist. The film faced problems with the censors and was criticized when it began showing in Egyptian cinemas. The stigma and lack of recognition even extends into the human rights sphere, one activist told CNN, explaining that some safety guidelines and advocacy work are done anonymously, not only due to social rejection but also because of a largely unwelcoming community. ""What needs to happen is there needs to be an official voice for gay people in Egypt,"" Ahmed -- not his real name -- told CNN. In private, more homosexual men and women are coming out to their families in Egypt to varying reactions, Nour said. But in the public sphere, the situation is more precarious. LGBT activists say they find their work more difficult than their human rights counterparts in other fields, who are already bracing for a potential government crackdown on civil society, particularly organizations working on human rights. The activists themselves run a ""double risk"" both because of their choice of field and by exposing their identity as members of the LGBT community, says Abd Elhameed. The ""Solidarity with Egypt LGBT"" campaign was launched earlier this year, but an online petition against the imprisonment of homosexuals in Egypt received just 216 signatures in six months. Ahmed would like to see an organization, recognized by the government, to advocate on the behalf of the LGBT community. He believes this would greatly improve their situation. But with the Ministry of Religious endowment -- an influential government agency-- condemning homosexuality, many see little prospect for change. ""There is no room for dialogue, that is my problem with Egypt. It is like, I want you to ask me about it and I will tell you and maybe you'll understand,"" he says. Until that time comes, Egypt's gays and lesbians will remain in the shadows. ""Hypothetically, there could be an uprising. But the whole country would back the mass killings of homosexuals; the whole country would sweep it under the rug, they would be behind the violence, that's the problem,"" Ahmed said. ""You can't fight the government when you don't have anything to fight the government with.""

"President Barack Obama's chief anti-ISIS coalition envoy, retired Gen. John Allen, arrived Thursday in Ankara, where it will be up to him to convince the Turkish government to take more decisive action against the terrorist group. ""The events of last week have made it clear that urgent and rapid steps are needed to halt [ISIS'] military capabilities,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, ""and Gen. Allen and [diplomat Brett] McGurk will make that clear in their meetings with Turkish officials."" Within the United States there is growing frustration with the Turks, whose participation in the U.S.-led coalition is vital. But they have been slow to respond to ISIS advances just beyond their southern border. ISIS is fighting to take the Syrian town of Kobani, a predominantly Kurdish town just steps from Turkey. In recent days, the United States has ramped up its airstrikes in the area, but without combat boots on the ground -- something the Obama administration is unwilling to commit -- the air campaign is unlikely to keep the town from falling into ISIS hands. The United States hopes Turkish troops could help turn the tide. The Turkish Parliament greenlit military action against ISIS last week, and they already have tanks and troops along the border. So far, those troops are hanging back. ""We want to see them be helpful,"" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said Wednesday. ""We know they have information and capabilities militarily that we just don't have, because they're there. They're a neighbor."" For his part, Secretary of State John Kerry said he expects Turkey's role in the coalition to become clearer after Allen's meetings. ""He is going to have long meetings through [Thursday] and Friday which we hope to determine exactly how Turkey will now enter this having resolved their hostage crisis,"" Kerry told reporters. ""Clearly, on their border -- this is of enormous concern to Turkey and they recognize that."" But Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Thursday it's not ""realistic"" for the world to expect Turkey to launch a ground operation against ISIS alone but that, ""once we reach a joint decision Turkey will continue to act and do its utmost."" Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu says it's the United States that must do more. In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Davutoglu said the U.S. must be willing to expand its role in Syria to take on the Bashar al-Assad regime, as well as extremist groups such as ISIS . ""We are ready to do everything if there is a clear strategy that after ISIS, we can be sure that our border will be protected,"" he said. ""We don't want the regime anymore on our border pushing people against -- towards Turkey."" In other words, Turkey is willing to help fight ISIS, if the United States can make certain commitments. Turkey willing to put troops in Syria ""if others do their part"" ""The Turks could make a tremendous difference,"" former U.S. ambassador to Iraq James Jeffrey tells CNN. ""What they're trying to do is to leverage their extraordinary geographic, military and political position -- and it is unique in the Middle East -- to get the United States to sign up more aggressively"" against Assad. Negotiating with Washington . Turkey also is holding out for help in creating a buffer zone to ward off the Syrian air force and protect refugees teaming into camps along the border. The Obama administration has long resisted that proposal, though the window seemed to open a bit on Wednesday, when Kerry said it was ""worth looking at very, very closely."" But Turkey's strategy of holding out for concessions is not without risk. ""If [Kobani] falls that will be a dramatic development,"" said Jeffrey, ""and it will of course expose Turkey to 500 miles of ISIS-controlled territory on its southern boundary. They don't want that."" And as the negotiations with Washington unfold, Turkey is also feeling internal pressure. Turkish Kurds, closely aligned with Kurds in Syria, are desperate to see their government take action. The Turkish government and Kurdish separatist parties recently opened the door for negotiations after decades of fighting. Now, the crisis in Kobani and the governments perceived inaction threaten to derail that progress and reignite violence inside Turkey. Thousands have taken to the streets of Turkey to protest their government's reluctance to act in Kobani. On Thursday, some of those protests turned violent, leading to the deaths of at least 24 people, according to the country's semi-official news agency, Anadolu. Meanwhile, Turkey's main opposition party said it will back a motion to authorize ground operations as long as they are limited to rescuing Kobani and repelling ISIS, Anadolu also reported. Despite mounting frustration with its coalition ally, the United States cannot afford to lose Turkey as an ally in the fight against ISIS. Turkey's key geography . Their location makes them a key regional partner, and the United States needs Turkey to cut off the flow of foreign fighters into Syria, most of whom enter by crossing the Turkish border. The United States also needs the Turkish government to crack down on black market sales of illegal oil, a main funding source for ISIS' activities. These issues are all on the table as Allen meets with Turkish officials over the next  two days.","A special U.S. envoy is in Turkey to wrangle more support for the fight against ISIS .

"Cairo (CNN)A bleeding woman collapses on the ground. A police officer totes a weapon behind her. It's an image that spread rapidly on social media -- and fueled furor among activists in Egypt who claimed it cast light on a devastating reality, four years after protests shaped a revolution that toppled Egypt's government. Activists say the woman, Shaimaa El-Sabbagh, was peacefully participating in a small protest commemorating the revolution in Cairo's Tahrir Square on Saturday when she was shot dead. Police deny using anything but tear gas as they quelled protests. But El-Sabbagh's colleagues at the Socialist Popular Alliance Party say police fired shots and killed her. ""If there were any attempts to hold security officers accountable over the past four years, Shaimaa wouldn't have been killed,"" said Khaled Dawood, a spokesman for the Constitution Party. El-Sabbagh was one of at least 16 people killed in protests over the weekend at events marking the fourth anniversary of Egypt's revolution, officials say. Fifteen were killed Sunday, including a police conscript, according to the Ministry of Health. Two of those killed were men trying to plant a bomb in Behira Province, ministry spokesman Hossam Abdel-Ghaffar said. It was not clear Sunday night how many people had been arrested, because some were released on the spot or shortly afterward, the Interior Ministry said. Eight journalists covering the Sunday protests were among those detained, the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression Reported. Meanwhile, the prosecutor general has launched an investigation into El-Sabbagh's death and called policemen on duty that day in for questioning, along with six Socialist Popular Alliance Party members arrested at the Saturday march. Elhamy El-Marghany, spokesman for the party, called El-Sabbagh's death an assassination that ""sends a message against political and partisan life."" Four years ago on Police Day, a national holiday celebrated January 25, thousands of Egyptians marched to protest security violations. The protests quickly gained momentum as clashes with security forces left hundreds dead and culminated in the ouster of then-President Hosni Mubarak. Almost all the police officers implicated in the 2011 violence were acquitted. Last November, a Cairo court dismissed charges against Mubarak and acquitted his interior minister and top security aides on charges related to the protesters' deaths. Thousands have been killed and thousands more arrested since 2011 as local and international rights groups decried the impunity with which security forces operated. The toll dramatically increased in the summer of 2013 following the removal of ex-President Mohamed Morsy in the wake of another wave of mass protests. The crackdown on his supporters in August 2013 left at least 1,000 killed. Many of the famous activists associated with the original January 25 demonstrations are now behind bars. Rights groups have scaled down operations as the government announced the activation of an old law that would restrict activities and funding. Those who marched with El-Sabbagh on Saturday chose to demonstrate the day before January 25 ""so they don't get confused or lumped with the Muslim Brotherhood protests,"" Dawood said. Egypt's government has said a surge in terrorist attacks have forced stricter measures, as hundreds of army and police personnel were killed in bombings and shootings. The Interior Ministry said in a statement to state media last December that it had arrested 10,000 rioters, saboteurs and terrorists in 2014 alone. The opposition has consistently condemned these attacks but says the regime is using terrorism as an excuse to impose more restrictions. On Sunday, Egyptian military armored personnel carriers closed Tahrir Square to traffic. State celebrations planned to mark the day were canceled to mourn the passing of Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah. Secular political parties that now see demonstration as an ineffective and costly tool for change dissuaded youth members from protesting on the anniversary day. ""Today there's a new phase of revolutionary work. The coup has to realize that the revolution has taken a new turn,"" Muslim Brotherhood spokesman Mohamed Montaser tweeted. ""Victory is inevitable.""​ . Sunday's demonstrations and marches took place away from the iconic square. The Anti-Coup Alliance, which was launched to support Morsy but has witnessed the departures of Islamist parties and movements seeking different strategies, posted photos and videos of marches and clashes with the police in and outside Cairo. For Reda Hamed, a 47-year-old member of the leftist Bread and Liberty Party, this clampdown on political life is the battlefront. It was the killing of April 6 Movement's Sayed Weza during the demonstrations last January 25 that convinced Hamed to reconsider his belief that revolutionaries shouldn't legitimize the regime by political participation. ""I'm not ready to see another kid shot. I had to think about changing the mechanism of the revolution. Demonstrations and protests had to be changed to protect the youth of the revolution, so that no one else is shot dead. Enough with blood,"" he told CNN. Hamed and fellow party members have an enduring goal: maintaining a place on the political scene until emerging parties are strong enough to mount a serious challenge. Electoral campaigning would provide a state-sanctioned framework to reach out to people, network and organize in a bid to achieve the goals that fueled the revolution, he explained. Days before the anniversary, Hamed was in Cairo's Salam City neighborhood telling potential voters about a revolution that hoped to make authorities accountable. ""The revolution didn't give us anything,"" a man told him. Others voiced numerous concerns about security, health care, unemployment and housing. They had little hope that Hamed or any elected official would bring about change. In a televised speech Sunday, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi struck an optimistic chord. ""The fourth anniversary represents to all of us a new flame of hope, development and action,"" he said. ""There is no doubt that there are shortcomings that exist and will take time until we all overcome them. With the will to work and the will to change, we will be able to overcome these shortcomings and achieve our hopes."" Finance Minister Hany Kadry told CNN late last year that the government is working on multiple fronts: battling inflation, increasing spending on education and health care, increasing the minimum wage and backing a new smart card system to deliver subsidies more efficiently. ""So we are dealing with this while the most important thing is to rebuild confidence in the Egyptian economy to attract investors again and because we believe very much that having a job is your first line of protection against poverty and hardship,"" he said. In addition to a megaproject developing the Suez Canal, Egypt is planning an international investment conference in March. In the densely populated, low-income Salam City, Hamed echoed the chant so popular during the revolution: ""Bread, freedom and social justice."" ""When there is bread and freedom, social justice and human dignity will be achieved. For people, it begins with bread."" The debate on how to achieve these goals is still going on, with the voices that oppose contesting elections gaining momentum after El-Sabbagh's death. ""We can't imagine that elections supervised by the Interior Ministry, presided over by the minister killing our youth, can be fair elections,"" Bread and Liberty spokesman Mona Azab said at a joint press conference on Sunday. ""Political parties that claim to battle for democracy, social justice and a civilian system should take a unified stance,"" Constitution Party head Hala Shukrallah said at the press conference. A Monday meeting will decide whether that means withdrawing from elections. Despite the setbacks, Hamed was hopeful. ""The revolution didn't fail. The revolution is on the path typically taken by all revolutions in the world. Revolutions don't happen and succeed in three to four years. The revolution is accumulative,"" he said, ""and we won't see results before 10 or 15 years at least."" CNN's Ian Lee and Sarah Sirgany reported and wrote from Cairo. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Josh Levs and Samira Said contributed to this report.","16 people were killed at protests marking the anniversary of Egypt's revolution .

"Just yards from where thousands of pro-democracy supporters have been ""occupying"" the heart of Hong Kong's financial district, stands an imposing gray building surrounded on all sides by a high wall -- this is the Hong Kong garrison of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), China's armed forces. The main gates of the base, known as the Prince of Wales barracks until London handed over the city to Beijing in 1997, are guarded by heavily armed sentries in green combat fatigues, who stand statue-like with impassive expressions 24 hours a day, seven days a week. But despite the fact Hong Kong is a Chinese territory, the PLA garrison abides by local Hong Kong laws that emphasize the city's considerable autonomy. In short they keep a low profile: the soldiers never come out onto the streets of the city, and there's minimal interaction with the local population beyond the occasional open day. While there is nothing to suggest this will happen, the possible intervention of the 6,000 PLA troops believed stationed here has been the ""elephant in the room"" for many, as we approach the first full week of pro-democracy demonstrations. For some protesters, memories are still fresh of 1989 and the brutal crackdown of student protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. PLA arrives . It was July 1, 1997 when the main force of Chinese soldiers rolled across the border from the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen into Hong Kong, as Britain formally ceded control of the territory it had controlled since 1841. Despite heavy rain, the convoy of green military trucks filled with soldiers clutching their rifles was met by crowds waving the flag of the nascent Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong: a white five-petal bauhinia flower on a red background. They headed for Hong Kong Island and their new base, which had earlier been vacated by a British military detachment and was now flying the flag of the People's Republic of China. The barracks, located in Hong Kong's Central district, are the garrison's headquarters but many PLA personnel -- particularly naval and air force units -- are stationed at smaller facilities across the territory. While troop numbers remain constant, the garrison's personnel are frequently rotated in and out of Hong Kong. According to the city's governing legislative council, the first rotation was conducted in 1998 and 12 rotations have been made since then. OPINION: Leung: Emotion 'will get us nowhere' Non interference . Under the newly-created ""Basic Law,"" a constitutional agreement that came into effect on July 1, 1997, the PLA garrison -- a mixture of personnel from PLA navy, ground and air forces -- is responsible for defense and to maintain the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the State and the security of Hong Kong. While Article 14 of the Basic Law stipulates that the garrison ""shall not interfere in the local affairs of Hong Kong,"" the Hong Kong government ""may, when necessary, ask the Central Government (Beijing) for assistance from the garrison in the maintenance of public order and disaster relief."" It then adds, ""the garrison shall perform its duties in accordance with the provisions of the national laws that the Central Government decides to apply in Hong Kong in the event that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress decides to declare a state of war or, by reason of turmoil within Hong Kong which endangers national unity or security and is beyond the control of the HKSAR Government, decides that Hong Kong is in a state of emergency."" However, Beijing has been at pains to emphasize that the current situation in Hong Kong is the responsibility of the local authorities to address. Since 1997, China's military presence in Hong Kong has been largely anonymous with little revealed about its daily operations -- with the exception of open days, when the city's population is invited into the PLA's barracks and given the opportunity to see its weaponry and meet soldiers. However, there have been signs in recent months that the PLA has started to be more high profile, with regular visits to the city's Victoria Harbor by warships. Recent accounts of armored vehicles rumbling between bases across the city has prompted many to speculate whether this is a deliberate ploy by Beijing to make its presence felt.","Protesters gathering close to Hong Kong garrison of the People's Liberation Army (PLA)

"(CNN) -- Did waterboarding and other coercive interrogation techniques that were used on al Qaeda detainees in CIA custody eventually lead to the Navy SEAL operation that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan early in the morning of May 2, 2011? The Senate Intelligence Committee report released Tuesday has a simple answer to that: Hell, no! According to the Senate report, the critical pieces of information that led to discovering the identity of the bin Laden courier, Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, (Ahmed the Kuwaiti) whose activities eventually pointed the CIA to bin Laden's hiding place in Pakistan, were provided by an al-Qaeda detainee before he was subjected to CIA coercive interrogation, and was based also upon information that was provided by detainees that were held in the custody of foreign governments. (The report is silent on the interesting question of whether any of these unnamed foreign governments obtained any of their information by using torture.) Further critical information about the Kuwaiti was also provided by conventional intelligence techniques and was not elicited by the interrogations of any of the CIA detainees, according to the report. Even worse for the CIA -- which has consistently defended the supposed utility of the interrogation program, including in the hunt for bin Laden -- a number of CIA prisoners who were subjected to coercive interrogations consistently provided misleading information designed to wave away CIA interrogators from the bin Laden courier who would eventually prove to be the key to finding al Qaeda's leader. The Senate report provides the fullest accounting so far of the exact sequence of intelligence breaks that led the CIA to determine that the courier, the Kuwaiti, was likely to be living with bin Laden in Pakistan. This reads more like a careful Agatha Christie detective story than a story about the efficacy of coercive interrogations, which some have characterized as torture. The report points out that the courier was in touch with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the operational commander of the 9/11 attacks, and that it was SIGINT (signals intelligence) from phones and email traffic that made this link first in 2002, well before any CIA detainees made such a connection. Indeed, in a fascinating footnote, the report makes the case that it was ""voice cuts"" of the courier that were first collected in 2002 that were matched eight years later to the Kuwaiti and were ""geolocated"" to an area of Pakistan in 2010 where he was traveling around. This was a crucial lead that helped prompt the CIA to examine the mysterious compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where bin Laden was hiding. In 2002, reports from four different detainees held by foreign governments provided important information about the courier's age, physical appearance and family, information that was also acquired prior to any information about the courier being obtained from CIA detainees. Detainees held by foreign governments also said that the courier was close to bin Laden. It was Hassan Ghul, an al Qaeda operative captured in Iraqi Kurdistan, who provided the most detailed account of bin Laden's courier and his relationship to bin Laden in January 2004, before he entered CIA custody. According to a CIA official cited in the report, Ghul, who was in Kurdish custody, ""sang like a tweetie bird. He opened up right away and was cooperative from the outset."" Ghul described the courier as bin Laden's ""closest assistant"" and ""one of three individuals likely to be with"" al Qaeda's leader. And he correctly surmised that bin Laden would have minimal security and ""likely lived in a house with a family somewhere in Pakistan."" If there was good intelligence coming from sources that were not in CIA custody, the Senate report demonstrates that the detainees who were in CIA custody and were subjected to coercive interrogations made every effort to hide the significance of bin Laden's courier. Five of the most senior al-Qaeda detainees in CIA custody, all of whom were subjected to some of the most intensive coercive interrogation techniques, variously said that the courier worked only with low level members of al Qaeda; that he was not a courier for bin Laden; that he wasn't close to al Qaeda's leader, and that he was focused only on his family following his marriage in 2002. None of this, of course, was true. The CIA, of course, is not happy about the portrayal of its work in the Senate report, and in a rebuttal on its website on Tuesday the agency pushed back, saying that detainees ""in combination with other streams of intelligence"" played a role in finding bin Laden. In particular the CIA cites a detainee, Ammar al-Baluchi, who was coercively interrogated and provided what it terms the first information indicating that the Kuwaiti was indeed bin Laden's courier, rather than just someone who was an ordinary member of al Qaeda. The CIA rebuttal is not, however as persuasive as the very detailed history laid out in the Senate report, which is buttressed by copious source notes. And, in any event, were interrogations of al Qaeda detainees really the key to how bin Laden ultimately was found? After all, it still took almost a decade after the first identification of the courier to find bin Laden. Indeed, there were a number of key breaks that had little to do with the interrogations of al Qaeda detainees, which I discovered in the course of reporting my book ""Manhunt."" A large break, according to U.S. counterterrorism officials, came in 2007, when a foreign intelligence service that they won't identify told the CIA that the Kuwaiti's real name was Ibrahim Saeed Ahmed. It would still take three more years for the CIA to find Ibrahim Saeed Ahmed in Pakistan, a country with a population of 180 million. This involved painstaking work going through reams of phone conversations to try to locate him through his family and circle of associates. In June 2010, the Kuwaiti and his brother both made changes in the way they communicated on cell phone, which suddenly opened up the possibility of the ""geolocation"" of both their phones, according to U.S. counterterrorism officials. Finally, sometime in the late summer of 2010, the Kuwaiti received a call from an old friend in the Persian Gulf, a man whom U.S. intelligence officials were monitoring. ""We've missed you. Where have you been?"" asked the friend. The Kuwaiti responded elliptically. ""I'm back with the people I was with before."" There was a tense pause in the conversation as the friend mulled over that response. Likely realizing that the Kuwaiti was back in bin Laden's inner circle, the caller replied after some hesitation, ""May God facilitate."" The CIA took this call as a confirmation that the Kuwaiti was still working with al Qaeda, a matter that officials were still not entirely sure about. The National Security Agency was listening to this exchange and through geolocation technologies was able to zero in on the Kuwaiti's cell phone in northwestern Pakistan. But the Kuwaiti practiced rigorous operational security and was always careful to insert the battery in his phone and turn it on only when he was at least an hour's drive away from the Abbottabad compound where he and bin Laden were living. To find out where the Kuwaiti lived by monitoring his cell phone would only go so far. In August 2010, a Pakistani ""asset"" working for the CIA tracked the Kuwaiti to the crowded city of Peshawar, where bin Laden had founded al Qaeda more than two decades earlier. In the years when bin Laden was residing in the Abbottabad compound, the Kuwaiti would regularly transit though Peshawar, as it is the gateway to the Pakistani tribal regions where al Qaeda had regrouped in the years after 9/11. Once the CIA asset had identified the Kuwaiti's distinctive white Suzuki SUV with a spare tire on its back in Peshawar, the CIA was able to follow him as he drove home to Abbottabad, more than two hours' drive to the east. The large compound where the Kuwaiti finally alighted immediately drew interest at the agency because it didn't have phone or Internet service, which implied its owners wanted to stay off the grid. Soon, some CIA officials would come to believe that bin Laden himself was living there. They were, of course, right.","Did coercive interrogation yield evidence pointing to bin Laden?

"(CNN)They may just have fled a war zone, but Syrian children on recess at the Zaatari Refugee Camp in Jordan aren't so different from kids elsewhere. Boys run around, wrestle and laugh outside a school comprised of tidy portable buildings on flat, rocky desert. Nearby, girls dressed in pink with bows in their hair hold hands and huddle around a book. Kids are resilient wherever they are. Unfortunately, even with the hardships of living in a camp, these kids are still some of the lucky ones. After all, at least half of Syrian refugee children aren't even in school. Indeed, if Syrian refugees were a country, they would have the lowest rate of educational enrollment in the world. And, without access to quality education, children here are at risk of not having the skills they need as adults. All this means that Syria is facing a lost generation. Why is all this happening? Because the civil war is destroying Syrian society. The United Nations announced earlier this month that Syrians are now the largest refugee population in the world -- more than 7.5 million Syrians are displaced internally, while another 3.2 million are registered refugees in neighboring countries. That's nearly half of Syria's total population. And while Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt have been remarkably generous hosts, the influx is so large that it's changing some countries' demographics, with refugees comprising at least 20% of Lebanon's population, 10% of Jordan's, and 10 to 20% of border areas in Turkey, according to the State Department and U.N. Meanwhile, more than 80% of the refugees reside in urban areas, not camps, and so rely on urban services, placing high demands on schools. All this is leaving education in crisis across the host countries. While each country officially allows Syrian children access to the public education system, barriers remain, including school space shortages, having to learn new languages, transportation, the need for children to work for their family's survival, and bullying. In addition, many are putting off school in the belief that their return to Syria is imminent. This creates very real risks to the quality of education for both host country nationals and Syrian children. The presence of refugees has meant crowded classrooms and constrained budgets, and it leaves teachers managing students who are at different levels. Continuous investment in these countries' education systems is therefore important so that the quality of education doesn't fall backwards. Sadly, there's no end in sight for Syria's civil war. And even when peace is re-established it will take years before many Syrians can return to their homes, given the destroyed infrastructure and residual tensions within society. This isn't unique to the current situation: In protracted refugee crises around the world, the average time until refugees can return home is 17 years, according to the United Nations. The responsibility for providing formal K-12 education for refugees lies primarily with the host governments, some of which are taking loans to cover the deficits. But while much of the international assistance response has so far been humanitarian, responding to urgent needs, what's needed now is a transition toward development planning, in which longer-term, sustainable solutions for education and other sectors are planned and resourced. This means investing in building capacities of host country governments to provide education to these additional people in the future. Donor funding will dry up over time, and the host governments will need systems to manage the additional children they must educate. Moving forward, host countries and the international aid community should prioritize investment in access to quality education, with additional attention to building infrastructure to expand school spaces, understanding and addressing other barriers to access, developing transportation options, improving data systems, expanding school monitoring and support, and providing teacher training about refugee needs in the classroom. This will also constitute an investment in the longer-term education development needs of the host countries, meaning they'll benefit, too. The suffering that has taken place in Syria since the civil war started in 2011 has been almost unimaginable. But by investing in the country's future in this way, the international community can help ensure education isn't another casualty of the war. And perhaps help lay the foundations for a brighter future.","Shelly Culbertson: At least half of Syrian refugee kids not in school .

"Sydney (CNN)Only one of the Sydney siege victims was shot by the gunman, with the second killed by fragments of police bullets fired when officers stormed the cafe, an inquest has heard. The revelations, which came in the opening day of an inquest into the 16-hour siege of a central Sydney cafe, are likely to further fuel questions about how New South Wales Police responded to the December 15 incident, especially their choice of weapons. Of the five shots fired by Man Haron Monis, a self-styled Muslim cleric who took 18 people hostage, only one found a target, counsel assisting the coroner Jeremy Gormly told the inquest. Monis shot and killed cafe manager Tori Johnson execution-style, prompting police to storm the cafe in the early hours of December 16, Gormly said. Victims of Sydney siege: A mother of three and a beloved son . All the injuries that followed -- two fatal, including those to Monis, and four non-fatal -- were caused by police fire, according to the evidence. The inquest is expected to examine whether the deaths of Johnson, the cafe's 34-year-old manager, and Katrina Dawson, a 38-year-old lawyer, could have been prevented. Addressing those at the hearing, which was closed to the public but open to hostages and victims' families, Gormly outlined the events that led to the deaths of Johnson, Dawson and the gunman. He said the first killing, of Johnson, occurred at about 2.14 a.m. -- shortly after a group of hostages fled the cafe. Gormly described an execution-style killing, in which Monis ordered Johnson to kneel, then ""simply shot him, without further notice or warning, in the back of the head."" ""The end of the barrel was about 75 centimeters from Mr Johnson's head at the moment of discharge,"" he said. ""Mr Johnson is believed to have died immediately."" The killing was witnessed by a police marksman, resulting in an immediate order to force entry, he said. Police then shot out the glass doors and windows, threw in 11 ""distractors,"" producing flashes and bangs, and two armed tactical response officers entered, firing 22 shots. At least two police bullets or bullet fragments struck Monis in the head and 11 other police bullets or fragments hit his body, killing him instantly, said Gormly. But their rounds ricocheted off the hard surfaces in the cafe, killing Dawson and injuring three other hostages and one of the response team, who was struck in the face. ""Ms Dawson was struck by six fragments of a police bullet or bullets,"" he said. Gormly said the siege began after Monis entered the Lindt Cafe at about 8.33 a.m., carrying a large backpack and a plastic bag containing a sawn-off shotgun, and ordered chocolate cake and tea. He moved to a table with a clear view of the cafe, then, after about 30 minutes, asked to speak with the manager. Staff noticed that Johnson's body language appeared tense. He called on an employee to fetch his keys, lock the doors and remain calm. Monis then stood up, produced a shotgun and announced that he had a bomb, before ordering hostages to hold up an Islamic flag. He then ordered Johnson to make an emergency call to authorities announcing that it was a terrorist attack, and that there were bombs elsewhere. Police arrived at the scene shortly after. Several investigations into what occurred over the two days of the siege are underway, including what information security agencies had on Monis, and how the police handled the crisis. Lawyers representing Dawson, Johnson and the police force will appear at the inquest, as well as lawyers representing two tactical response officers. Johnson's family members were in attendance, as well as John O'Brien, one of the first hostages to escape.

"A prolonged undersea search for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 could cost nearly a quarter of a billion U.S. dollars if private companies are used, Australia's top transport official said Thursday. Martin Dolan emphasized that the $234 million price tag is a ""ballpark rough estimate"" of an extended search and salvage mission that includes an underwater vehicle. The Bluefin-21 is back at work Friday morning on a fifth trip into the southern Indian Ocean. Authorities said the vessel has scanned a total of 110 square kilometers (42.5 square miles) without making any ""contacts of interest."" Searchers seem to be preparing for the possibility that an underwater drone scan of the ocean may not yield debris from the plane immediately. Malaysia's acting transport minister, Hishammuddin Hussein,  said that authorities are looking at deploying more unmanned underwater probes. Officials might consider searching along a large portion of sea highlighted by a partial digital ""handshake"" between the jetliner and an Inmarsat PLC satellite, Dolan said. That arc of sea is over 370 miles long and 30 miles wide. Underwater search . Officials didn't indicate whether Bluefin's fourth mission was a lengthy one. The Bluefin was forced to abort its mission twice this week; the first time after it exceeded its original depth limit and the second time over a technical issue. After the latter was resolved, officials dipped it into the ocean again. Phoenix International Holdings, which owns and operates the equipment under a contract for the U.S. Navy, called the third dive ""very productive,"" saying that the underwater drone spent nearly 13 hours at the sea bottom. But after four dives, ""there has been no debris or aircraft wreckage discovered,"" the company said. The underwater vessel takes two hours to get near the ocean floor and another two hours to return to the surface. It aims to map the ocean floor for 16 hours to retrieve data, which then take four hours to analyze. The vessel searches maximum depths of 4,500 meters (14,764 feet). The U.S. Navy has determined the seafloor in the search area reaches a maximum depth of 4,600 meters (15,092 feet). Bluefin operators said they can reprogram it to operate at 5,000 meters (16,404 feet), giving it more leeway. New setbacks . Officials believe a recent ping heard in the search area has the right frequency to belong to the flight data recorder's emergency beacon. The quality of the ""ping"" led authorities to focus the underwater search in the area. And as the underwater focus continues, officials faced other setbacks. A preliminary analysis of an oil sample collected in the ocean shows that it is not aircraft engine oil or hydraulic fluid, Australia's Joint Agency Coordination Centre said Thursday. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished on March 8 with 239 people aboard after taking off from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, bound for Beijing. With no debris found so far and no possible pings from the plane's ""black boxes"" detected in a week, officials shifted the focus of the search underwater.","Malaysian official raises the possibility of more underwater search vehicles .

"It's the kind of anxiety you feel when a Category 5 Hurricane is hurtling your way. You can't gauge with certainty what will fall in its path, what will remain in its aftermath. You board up. And wait. That's the way much of Ferguson feels as it waits for the St. Louis County grand jury to decide whether Officer Darren Wilson should stand trial in the shooting of Michael Brown. The grand jurors technically have until January, but the prosecutor's office has said a decision could come in mid-November. It's mid-November. Lawyers, analysts and journalists have been speculating on when it will be announced. Residents of Ferguson, however, are done with all that for the most part. It has been a long calm before the impending storm. ""We just want them to get it over with"" is a common refrain. They saw street demonstrations  erupt after Brown's killing. They saw how violent things became. They watched heavily armed police come face to face with angry protesters demanding justice. So did the rest of the nation, and the world. Ferguson became a flashpoint for racial tension. Some predict that will be the case again when the grand jury's decision is announced. Will the white police officer face any charges in the death of a black, unarmed 18-year-old? Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency Monday as a precaution in the event of unrest or violence. Along West Florissant Avenue, the ground zero of violent protests, businesses put back the plywood boards they had taken down from their windows and doors. Business owners were tired of answering questions about how they had fared through the weeks and weeks of tension. ""How do you think we are doing?"" asked Dan McMullen, owner of Solo Insurance Services on West Florissant. ""I just want to get this over with and move on,"" he said, sitting at his desk behind the boarded-up entrance to his strip mall office. He said some protesters came in wanting to leave flyers with information in his office. ""I told them to get the hell out. You broke my windows and now you want me to put out your literature?"" Ferguson Mayor James Knowles told local media this month that he expected demonstrations across the region and warned authorities to ""prepare for the worst."" Your view from Ferguson . 'We've had three months to prepare' St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said Tuesday that his officers are ready for whatever happens. ""We've had three months to prepare. ... Acts of violence will not be tolerated,"" he told CNN. ""Our intelligence is good. Our tactics are good. We can protect lawful people and at the same time arrest criminals."" Area school superintendents wrote a letter to city officials and authorities requesting that they announce the grand jury's decision on an evening or weeknight so it doesn't affect about 20,000 students traveling back and forth to schools. Many parents received notice to fetch their children from school if the decision comes out earlier in the day. A group of community members calling themselves the Don't Shoot Coalition has asked for 48 hours' notice before the ruling is made public. It also released 19 ""Rules of Engagement"" that touch on major points of contention between protesters and police. The group wants assurances that neither police nor the government will interfere with the flow of information, as well as a guarantee that police won't use rubber bullets, armored vehicles, rifles or tear gas. The group also requested that officers wear attire ""minimally required for their safety"" and that ""specialized riot gear be avoided except as a last resort."" Dry runs in cold weather . In the St. Louis area, protesters have been staging dry runs on how to face police. And continuing their demonstrations. Despite below-freezing temperatures Monday, about 100 activists disrupted lunchtime traffic in the nearby city of Clayton. Brown's shooting on August 9 also touched a national nerve, with protests decrying racism and police brutality taking place around the country since his death. The Ferguson National Response Network expects that reaction to the grand jury ruling will not be limited to the St. Louis area. It has set up a Tumblr account advertising about 70 ""planned responses"" to the ruling. They will take place from West Palm Beach, Florida, to New York to Chicago to Los Angeles. Brown's supporters have turned out in force, but Wilson's supporters have demonstrated on occasion as well. They point to witness testimony and leaked grand jury documents that suggest Brown might have attacked Wilson, struggled for his gun and perhaps even charged the officer after the tussle over the weapon. McMullen, the insurance company owner on West Florissant, said that protesters have made this into a racial issue but have ignored the facts of the case. ""There is no way a police officer in America would just get out of his car and shoot someone for no reason,"" he said. Protesters are aware of the other version of events, but it doesn't stem their anger. Many told CNN in August that other witnesses allege Wilson shot Brown at least six times as he stood about 30 feet from Wilson's police cruiser. The fatal shots were fired as Brown had his hands up in surrender, they believe. Perhaps stoking the most anger is that all six shots hit Brown above the waist, leading community members to believe Wilson never had any intention of arresting the 18-year-old. Images of Brown's body lying on the street went viral through social media. Where he once lay is a makeshift memorial -- half on the sidewalk and half on Canfield Drive, in the middle of the road, exactly where Brown fell. Snow blanketed the hundreds of stuffed animals and plastic flowers as kids bundled up in jackets and scarves made their way home from school Monday afternoon. A lone videographer rolled his camera in front of the QuikTrip gas station that was looted and burned on the first night of violent protests. Everyone was keenly aware that something like that could happen again. At any moment. Complete coverage in Ferguson .","St. Louis police chief says ""acts of violence will not be tolerated""

"(CNN) -- In a region scarred by conflict and instability, a broadcast unites Arabs from many nations in front of their television sets. ""Arab Idol,"" an adaptation of ""American Idol,"" is going strong in the Middle East. In the latest finale, the winner -- Hazem Shareef of Syria -- broke with the trend and refused to carry his country's flag in his victory celebration. The reason? After his golden pipes captivated viewers for months, he didn't want to appear to be taking a side in the civil war. ""I am 21 years old, and I don't want my art to be connected to politics,"" he said. Regardless of their country's strife, winners have celebrated their moments in the spotlight showing their national flags. Last year, Palestinian Mohammad Assaf of Gaza wore his on a scarf to represent his people. Karmen Suleiman of Egypt appeared with that country's flag a year after the 2011 Egyptian revolution. Though Shareef ditched the national colors, he did dedicate his ""victory song"" to Syria. The show's judges didn't hesitate to place their fingers in Syria's wounds.

"A top United Nations official on Monday told the Security Council she has ""run out of words"" to describe the worsening situation in Syria. ""Every time we use a new figure in relation to the Syrian crisis, we say that it is unprecedented. We have run out of words to fully explain the brutality violence and callous disregard for human life which is a hallmark of this crisis,"" Valerie Amos, the U.N. chief for humanitarian affairs said. Nearly 200,000 people have been killed in the 3-year Syrian conflict and one million injured, Amos said, describing a war zone with three combative parties fighting each other with no regard for the thousands of civilians and children caught in the middle. The Syrian government has used barrel bombs in densely populated areas and ""arbitrarily detained"" citizens and subjected them to serious beatings and torture. Armed opposition groups have taken locals hostage and killed civilians by using explosive mortar and car bombs. ISIS has committed ""mass victimization"" of civilians, including murder, enslavement, rape, displacement and torture, Amos said. All parties involved in the conflict ""continue to violate the most basic of laws with devastating consequences,"" she said. The under-secretary general described a particularly horrible situation for the country's children. Reports of children being publicly executed, crucified, beheaded and stoned to death -- particularly by ISIS -- has increased in recent months. Other children, sometimes as young as 5 years old, are being trained at military camps, Amos said. ""This conflict is not only shattering Syria's present, it is also destroying its future,"" she added. Locations traditionally identified as safe havens in conflict areas -- such as hospitals, schools and U.N. relief vehicles -- have not been exempt from attacks. 70 medical facilities across the country have been attacked over the last nine months, 60 by government forces, Amos said, citing statistics from Physicians for Human Rights. 150 medical personnel, including 97 in the line of duty, were killed over the same time period. While opposition groups have blocked medical supplies from entering besieged cities, the government ""continues to withdraw medicines, medical equipment and supplies, including for surgical intervention, such as antibiotics and injectable medicines from U.N. convoys,"" she said. Besieged cities are largely in deadlock. ""No one allowed out; no aid allowed in. For years,"" Amos said before describing a new tactic in one besieged town:  ""Tiny amounts of aid allowed in, giving people hope, but so little it can only help a fraction of those in need. People's hopes raised and then dashed. Time and time again."" The U.N. has identified air bombs, car bombs or mortar attacks on or near schools at least 35 times since February, resulting in the death of at least 105 children, Amos said. Amos urged the Security Council members to ensure all parties in Syria follow what they have outlined in resolutions: end indiscriminate use of weapons, protect children from violations, lift sieges on city and allow unhindered humanitarian assistance. ""Even in war, there are rules,"" she said.","A top U.N. official says there are no words to accurately describe the Syrian conflict .

"A Navy veteran in Missouri said he was fired from his job and called a terrorist for posting pictures to Facebook of Homeland Security vehicles massing near Ferguson. Mark Paffrath, who worked for the Drury hotel chain, said he could not believe what he was hearing when he was called into his boss' office last week, a couple of days after posting the pictures, which he took in the parking lot of the hotel where he worked. ""The head of security for Drury was in there, and he pretty much called me a terrorist, saying that I dishonorably served my country for posting those pictures and videos on Facebook,"" Paffrath said. The pictures he took and posted on Thursday were of dozens of vehicles marked with the logos of the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Protection Services. Paffrath said the large number of federal vehicles and employees arrived last week. ""You know, it surprised me, and I was rather shocked that they were there. So I took a short video and a picture of the vehicles. I didn't give any location out,"" he said. The vehicles were located about a 30-minute drive from Ferguson, Missouri. That's what prompted Paffrath, who was born and raised in Ferguson, to ask this question when he posted the images: . ""Why are all these vehicles here, I wonder if it has anything to do with Ferguson? #Ferguson, #No justice, no peace."" On Saturday, two days after posting the photos, he said he was fired. Paffrath -- who served three years in the military, including overseas stints -- was honorably discharged and said he did not appreciate being called something so dishonorable. The local Drury hotel where Paffrath worked said it was not authorized to comment on the case, but Joseph Pereles, a Drury Hotels' vice president, sent this statement to CNN: ""We do not publicly discuss confidential personnel matters. The safety and privacy of our guests and our team members has always been and will remain our top priority."" Ferguson awaits grand jury decision . Paffrath said he is sure the influx of folks from Homeland Security must have something to do with preparations for the potential reaction to the upcoming grand jury decision in the case of Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson, who shot and killed unarmed teenager Michael Brown in August, sparking three months of daily -- and sometimes violent -- protests. A law enforcement source told CNN the Department of Homeland Security does have additional resources in place to protect federal buildings, but they're also there because the world's attention is on Ferguson, which could attract attackers looking to make a statement. The FBI and DHS have issued a law enforcement bulletin to be on guard for attacks on law enforcement officers. The arrival of extra federal authorities came just a few days before Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon announced that he had activated the National Guard and declared a state of emergency in preparation for the grand jury's decision. St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay applauded Nixon's decision, saying tired police officers are happy to know the extra help is there. But many protestors said they are disturbed by the decision, feeling it further paints them as violent, when for more than 100 days they have held mostly peaceful protests.

"As ISIS militants seem poised to take the strategic city of Kobani at the Turkish-Syrian border, violent protests have broken out in Turkey, leaving some demonstrators dead. The death toll has reached 19, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Wednesday.  Another 145 people have been injured, and 388 have been arrested, he said. Thousands of people have taken to the streets for the protests, at times ignoring curfews set by the government. Some demonstrators died in clashes between rival groups, authorities said.  Others died in clashes with police. A new security office will work around the clock to improve security in the country, Davutoglu said. The protesters, many of them Kurds, are calling on the Turkish government to take tough action against ISIS, and to allow Turkish fighters to go across the border and fight ISIS militants.

"(CNN)A Turkish court Wednesday banned website pages that show the new cover of Charlie Hebdo, the country''s semiofficial news agency Anadolu reported. A newspaper that included images of the cover received death threats. The developments came as Deputy Prime Minister Yalcin Akdogan wrote on Twitter, ""Those who are publishing figures referring to our supreme Prophet are those who disregard the sacred."" Such a move is ""open incitement and provocation,"" he added. Turkey is home to 82 million people, 99.8% of whom are Muslim, according to the CIA World Factbook. The French satirical publication Charlie Hebdo's new cover contains what it calls a caricature of the Prophet Mohammed holding a sign saying ""Je suis Charlie.""  The caption says ""All is forgiven"" in French. It comes a week after Islamist terrorists killed 12 people at the paper's offices. Police went to the offices of Istanbul newspaper Cumhuriyet and blocked off traffic around it after the paper published excerpts from the Charlie Hebdo issue. Armored police blocked the entrance and stopped distribution trucks at the printing press in Istanbul, the secular daily said. The prosecutor's office then stopped the blockade, possibly because it did not know the image was inside the paper, according to the report. Cumhuriyet included a four-page sample of Charlie Hebdo's latest edition, translated into Turkish. That sample, which the prosecutor's office saw, did not include the cover, the paper said. But inside the paper, two columnists had included small images of the cover with their columns, the paper reported. An editorial in the newspaper said the drawing on the Charlie Hebdo cover did not seem to have ""anything to do with Prophet Mohammed. That drawing is a symbol of a humane and conscientious attitude and it says, 'All is forgiven.'""

"Egypt's former longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak was cleared of charges in a retrial Saturday and could soon be released -- a stunning reversal for a man who faced life imprisonment or worse after a revolution toppled him in 2011. A Cairo judge dismissed charges linking Mubarak to the deaths of hundreds of protesters during the 2011 revolt and found him not guilty of corruption. Mubarak, who ruled Egypt as president for 29 years, was stoic as his supporters in the courtroom cheered the decision that capped a months-long retrial. The 86-year-old, reclining on a hospital gurney in a defendants' cage, nodded while fellow defendants kissed him on the head. Later, he told the country's Sada ElBalad TV station in a brief phone interview that he ""didn't commit anything."" ""I laughed when I heard the first verdict,"" he said of the first trial. ""When it came to the second verdict, I said I was waiting. It would go either way. It wouldn't have made a difference to me either way."" Prosecutor-General Hisham Barakat will appeal the verdict, Egypt's government-controlled Al-Ahram newspaper website reported early Sunday. Mubarak was convicted in 2012 of issuing orders to kill peaceful protesters during the country's 2011 uprising and was sentenced to life in prison. He appealed and was granted a new trial last year. Also acquitted Saturday were Mubarak's former Interior Minister Habib el-Adly and six of el-Adly's aides, who'd been accused of being connected to the deaths of 239 protesters as security forces cracked down on them in 2011. Mubarak's two sons also were acquitted Saturday of corruption. Mubarak still has a three-year sentence for a previous conviction for embezzlement, but it wasn't immediately clear how much time he's already been credited with, and therefore when he will be free. CNN's efforts to reach Mubarak's lawyer Farid El-Deeb for comment weren't immediately successful. Both sides have alleged that Mubarak's trials have been politicized, with supporters arguing he was unfairly vilified and opponents fearing that he'd be acquitted as memories of the revolution faded. His legal fortunes did seem to parallel the political climate -- just last year, Mohamed Morsy, the Islamist who became Egypt's first democratically elected president, supported a retrial with the backing of his supporters, who argued Mubarak should have received a death sentence rather than life in captivity. But Morsy himself was deposed by the military in July 2013, as opponents accused him of pursuing an Islamist agenda at the exclusion of other factions. And now the Arab Spring revolt that ousted Mubarak has come nearly full circle -- Mubarak appears close to freedom; Morsy is jailed, his Muslim Brotherhood banned; and Morsy supporters allege the current government has returned to Mubarak's authoritarian practices. Explaining the verdict . Judge Mahmoud el-Rashidy said he dropped charges against Mubarak because Cairo Criminal Court didn't have the jurisdiction to try him for the protesters' deaths. The judge said the case that prosecutors initially referred to the court listed only el-Adly and his aides as defendants -- not Mubarak himself. But after mass protests pressured the prosecutor general to question Mubarak, a second referral was made to the court, and the two cases were merged into one. Lawyer Hoda Nasralla, who represents the families of 65 slain and injured protesters, said the inclusion of Mubarak in a second referral should have trumped his exclusion in the first. ""The judge shied away from directly acquitting Mubarak even though he was accused of conspiring with Adly, and Adly was acquitted,"" she said. ""The judge resorted to formalities instead."" 'I want only God's retribution' Salway El-Sayed, mother of one of the slain 2011 protesters, sat down on a sidewalk outside the court after she heard Saturday's verdicts, praying to God to deliver justice. She broke down in tears, her hands shaking, as she recalled her son Tamer Hanafy, who was killed in January 2011 at Cairo's Tahrir Square, epicenter of the uprising. ""I'm worried my son's blood would go in vain,"" she said. ""Our children's blood isn't cheap. Their blood is precious, like any other blood."" ""I don't want execution,"" she continued. ""This won't bring back my son ... I want only God's retribution. Nothing more."" Tahrir Square was closed to traffic following Saturday's verdicts. One man was killed and nine people were injured as several hundred demonstrators clashed nearby with Egyptian security forces, Egyptian Ministry of Health spokesman Hossam Abdel Ghaffar told CNN. Police fired tear gas and bird shot at the protesters. The Ministry of Interior said police were pelted by rocks before the incident escalated. The human rights group Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, whose lawyers represented more than 60 civil plaintiffs in the case, said that Saturday's verdict solidified the impunity that it says security forces and their leaders enjoy. ""Justice was dealt another severe blow,"" the group said in a news release. How it started . In January 2011, throngs of Egyptians filled the streets of Cairo to decry the country's poverty, unemployment and repression. Protesters called for Mubarak to step down but were met by a fierce and often violent government crackdown. Mubarak eventually stepped down in 2011. That freed up long-supressed Islamist movements, including the Muslim Brotherhood, to run for office. Morsy, backed by the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, became president in June 2012. But Morsy was ousted in a coup about a year later amid widespread protests against his rule. Since then, Cairo's military-installed government has banned the Brotherhood, calling it a terrorist group -- an allegation it denies -- and accusing it of being behind a wave of deadly attacks on police and the military. Many Islamist and secular activists have been arrested and given lengthy sentences. A restrictive protest law and repeated deadly crackdowns on demonstrations followed. Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the general who led Morsy's ouster, was elected president in May after leaving the military to run for the office. Not free yet . Since Mubarak stepped down in February 2011, the ailing former ruler has appeared in court numerous times on a variety of charges, often  wheeled in on a gurney. His lawyers say he suffered health problems after his 2011 arrest, including a stroke, and he has served much of his prison time at a military medical facility. In May, a Cairo court sentenced him to three years in prison for embezzlement. His sons Gamal and Alaa were sentenced to four years each on the same charge. All three were convicted of embezzling $18 million that was allocated for the renovation of presidential palaces. The Mubaraks have insisted they are not guilty.","Mubarak tells Egyptian TV station: ""I didn't commit anything""

"Sally Barnes-Breen watched her father die while waiting months just to see a doctor at the dysfunctional Department of Veterans Affairs. Now she says a bill signed into law on Thursday by President Barack Obama doesn't hold accountable those responsible for what happened. ""They broke all the medical codes, when you swear on your oath,"" she told CNN of the inability of her father, Navy veteran Thomas Breen, to get an appointment. ""Billions of dollars can't fix the VA broken system,"" she continued. ""What's going to fix (this) is if you criminalize people when they do wrong."" The $16 billion measure doesn't criminalize anybody. It provides money to build more VA medical facilities and hire more doctors and nurses. It includes more funds so some veterans can get health care in private facilities. It also makes it easier to fire or otherwise discipline senior VA officials. At the bill-signing at Fort Belvoir in northern Virginia, Obama said the package begins the changes needed to keep the nation's promise of caring for its military veterans. Obama: 'Inexcusable conduct' ""Over the last few months, we've discovered some inexcusable conduct,"" he said. ""This is wrong. It's outrageous."" The law will help the VA system ""keep pace with the demand"" caused by veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Obama said. ""This will not and cannot be the end of our efforts,"" he said, adding that implementing the law ""is going to take time."" Along with the increased hospitals and physicians, the measure will allow veterans in remote or rural areas more than 40 miles from facility and those unable to get care ""in a reasonable amount of time"" to see private doctors, Obama noted. Congress approved the package just before going home for its August recess. A CNN investigation that started in November uncovered excessive waits for veterans seeking health care. Subsequent reports revealed secret lists kept by some VA hospitals to hide the waiting periods and other management problems. Dozens of veterans died while waiting for care. The crisis led to the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki in May as well as congressional investigations. The FBI has also joined an investigation by the VA inspector general's office. The agency watchdog said Thursday its investigation of wrongdoing such as wait time manipulation had expanded to 92 VA medical facilities across the country. New VA secretary . Last week, the Senate confirmed Robert McDonald as the agency's new secretary. The former business executive has promised to swiftly carry out reforms intended to speed up care for returning soldiers entering the VA system and eliminate bogus record-keeping. Obama noted that the overhaul gives McDonald authority to remove leaders more easily, saying anyone who engaged in unethical practices or covered them up ""should be fired, period."" McDonald, who attended the signing, will begin visiting VA hospitals and clinics around the country starting Friday, beginning in Phoenix, Obama said. Thomas Breen died in November 2013 after being repeatedly denied care at the Phoenix VA medical facility. A month later came a call from the VA saying he had an appointment scheduled.

"Six months after a passenger ferry sank off the coast of South Korea, a victim's body was discovered inside the wreckage on Tuesday. The body was found on the fourth floor in the women's bathroom, located at the center of the sunken Sewol ferry, according to the South Korea joint task force, in charge of the search. The body has not been retrieved yet, due to poor water visibility and limited space. Search officials believe the victim is female. Nine victims remain missing after the ferry sank on April 16, killing at least 295 people. The underwater search has continued in the months following the disaster, depending on weather conditions. Officials have said they will not stop the search operation unless families wish otherwise. But questions have swirled over what could happen to the search as winter approaches. The Yonhap News Agency in South Korea reported that it has been 102 days since the last body was recovered from the ferry. The ferry sank 195 days ago. The Sewol disaster caused widespread outrage in the country over lax safety standards and the failure to rescue more people as the ship foundered. Several members of the crew are facing trial -- including the captain who will learn his verdict on November 11.

"A small town in Wisconsin is a far cry from the civil war-ravaged fields of northern Syria. But for Jordan Matson, a former U.S. solider, the battlefield feels most like home. For the last month, Matson, 28, has been a volunteer fighter in the Kurdish militia known here as the People's Protection Units, or YPG. The group has been defending three small Kurdish statelets in northern Syria. The Kurdish militants have also spent much of the last year battling ISIS, the hardline jihadist group that wants to create an Islamic state across parts of Iraq and Syria. ""Due to two years of almost no foreign policy in the region -- while these people threatened American citizens, and bring harm to us -- I think I decided enough was enough, and I decided to come out this way,"" Matson said. He saw the fall of Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, as a turning point. ""All of the American brothers that have died over there -- all the American veterans that have died over there -- and paid their lives for that country so they could have a democracy. That just resonated in my mind. And I couldn't live with myself letting that country fall, and all my brothers' lives be for nothing,"" Matson said. But instead of ending up in Iraq, Matson joined the YPG in Syria. It marked a dramatic turn for the former soldier. During more than two years in the U.S. military, Matson says, he never saw combat, nor was he shipped overseas to serve. In Syria, he saw action almost as soon as he arrived. Two days after reaching the Kurdish enclave known as Rojava, he says, he was hit by a mortar round during a firefight with ISIS. Now mostly recovered from shrapnel wounds, but still squinting occasionally from the wounds caused by the dirt that the mortar shell sprayed in his eye, Matson met CNN in the YPG-controlled town of Al-Malikiyah. ""All my life, I've wanted to be a soldier. So it just fits well over here,"" he said. ""I'm at peace being here."" 'Taking the fight to the enemy' Matson is from Sturtevant, Wisconsin, a ""mom and pop town"" as he described it, with just a few restaurants and three gas stations. He worked the third shift at a food packaging company but missed military life. Matson said he was honorably discharged from the U.S. Army in 2007. Because of problems with his record, he says the military refused to take him back, despite his multiple efforts to re-enlist. ""Civilian life just wasn't for me. The normal 9-to-5, I just wasn't comfortable with it,"" he said. ""Over here, everything makes sense."" Matson got in contact with the YPG on Facebook. He prayed about what to do for a month or two, he said, before making the leap. He flew to Turkey, where he was picked up and taken to Rojava, a Kurdish-controlled area of northern Syria. Matson misses a few things about the United States: hamburgers, toilets, rock 'n' roll. But he wouldn't change where he is for anything. He speaks about the Kurdish movement with the fervor of a recent convert. ""It's for these people that I'm doing this. Yes, it does help Americans back home, because we're taking the fight to the enemy here, so they can't take it to us. So it's that to a degree. But, for me, it's for the Kurdish people,"" Matson said. U.S. airdrops give much needed aid in Kobani, but did ISIS get some? Foreign fighters . U.S. law enforcement officials say it's illegal for an American to join a Syrian militia, just as it is for an American to join ISIS. According to intelligence estimates, more than 100 of the foreign fighters for ISIS in Syria have come from the United States. Canadian authorities believe that 130 Canadian citizens are taking part in jihad. Hundreds more have traveled from Europe. Thousands come from the Middle East and Africa. When asked whether he saw any parallels between those foreign jihadi fighters and himself, Matson said there's nothing he can do to change their minds. ""They've come here to push an agenda, to push one way of life over people who do not want it. And I will not sit and stand by while people like that take those actions,"" he said. He says he believes the U.S. government is watching what he does, but will not consider him a terrorist, nor deny him re-entry. If that happens, however, Matson says he could just stay in Kurdistan. ""Once this fight is over, and ISIS has been crippled, then the next stage of my life, then I'll think about that,"" he said. After the rescue: A Yazidi family's harrowing flight to escape ISIS . 'Someone has to do it' Since recovering from his wounds, Matson has been working to bring other foreign fighters to Syria. He says he's recruiting for the YPG on social media. Most of the people interested are former military, he said. ""I've had ex-military ask from Eastern Europe, Western Europe, Canada, the United States, Australia, you name it. They've been asking. ISIS has threatened all these countries that I've named to push their agenda in those nations, and the veterans of those nations who love their countries don't want to sit by while this is happening,"" he said. The YPG are lightly armed guerrilla fighters. Most lack helmets and armor. They rely heavily on Kalashnikov assault rifles. But their ranks have also been reinforced by Kurds from Turkey, many of whom are veterans of a 30-year guerrilla war fought between the Turkish state and a sister organization to the YPG known as the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK. The U.S., the European Union and Turkey officially list the PKK as a terrorist organization. The bloodbath in the Middle East has blurred loyalties. This month, the United States began providing air support to YPG fighters defending the Syrian border town of Kobani from an ISIS siege. In addition to bombing ISIS militants in and around Kobani, U.S. military planes parachuted weapons, ammunition and medicine to YPG fighters, infuriating the Turkish government. Matson said the YPG could use more support on the ground, in addition to ongoing U.S.-led airstrikes. Although those strikes, he said, have helped to shift the balance of power on the battlefield, he stressed that a lot more needs to be done. As soon as he can, he says, he'll head back to the front line. ""The way I look at it is someone has to do it, and if we don't fight, ISIS will grow -- will become more well-funded -- and they will push their agenda. So we need men on the front to take the fight to the enemy before the enemy can take the fight to us,"" Matson said.","Jordan Matson, a former U.S. Army solider, is fighting against ISIS .

"(CNN) -- The man who shot three women dead in a Pennsylvania gym before killing himself this week posted at least two videos on YouTube last year, apparently referring to a desire for a girlfriend in both. George Sodini addresses the camera in his basement in one of his YouTube videos. George Sodini, 48, gave a tour of his house in one clip, his camera briefly panning across a book called ""Date Young Women"" in his living room. ""The couch and chairs, they match. The woman will really be impressed,"" he says just before showing the book. In the bedroom, he says, ""It looks pretty clean. I'm sure she'll be impressed."" It is not clear whether he is speaking about a particular person. He speaks directly to the camera in the second video, posted four months later. ""It is easy for me to hide from my emotions for one more day,"" he says, speaking to a mirror in his basement. ""Take a long drive in a car, listen to some music, daydream or just do some mundane task around the house that really doesn't need to be done that's not too important. And there you go, one more day, and one more day turns into one more year.""  Watch some of the shooter's videos » . Sodini walked into a gym aerobics class and began shooting about 8 p.m. Tuesday, killing three women and wounding nine others before turning the gun on himself. He ""just had a lot of hatred in him,"" Allegheny County police superintendent Charles Moffatt said Wednesday. He brought four handguns into the LA Fitness gym outside Pittsburgh and used three of them, firing at least 36 times, Moffatt said. Those killed were identified by the county's medical examiner as Heidi Overmier, 46, of Carnegie, Pennsylvania; Elizabeth Gannon, 49, of Pittsburgh; and Jody Billingsley, 38, of Mount Lebanon. Authorities think Sodini targeted the aerobics class specifically, as a schedule was found in his home with that class circled, Moffatt said. But police do not believe that he targeted anyone personally. Rather, because of an online diary he left, as well as notes at the scene and at his home, they think he was targeting women in general. In the note left at the scene in Sodini's gym bag, Moffatt said, he complains that he had never spent a weekend with a woman, never vacationed with a woman and never lived with a woman, and that he had had limited sexual experiences. He makes similar complaints in his blog, which also documents his growing rage at women for their rejection of him and at the world he felt had abandoned him. Sodini, a member of the gym, was found dead in the aerobics room of the gym, lying on top of one of his guns about 7 feet from one of the victims. He had worked as a systems analyst in the finance department of K&L Gates, a law firm with an office in Pittsburgh, since 1999, said Mike Rick, a spokesman for the firm. Neighbors described him as reclusive and said he had stopped talking to them in the past few years. Sodini apparently had ""practice runs"" before the shooting Tuesday, Moffatt said. Someone at the gym had showed him how to shut off the lights, he said, not knowing of his plans. ""He was hell bent on committing this act,"" Moffatt said. Three of the four guns found with Sodini were traced back to him, and authorities are in the process of tracing the fourth, Moffatt said. They were two 9 mm semiautomatics, a .45-caliber revolver and a .38 in his pocket. Sodini also had 30-round ammunition clips that were illegal before the assault weapons ban was lifted in 2004, police said. On Tuesday, Sodini visited the gym three times: the first about 11 a.m., a second time at 7:40 p.m. and a third time at 7:56 p.m., Moffatt said. Members of the gym are required to swipe a card to check in but do not have to check out, he said. The first 911 call was dispatched at 8:16 p.m. However, police know that Sodini made a telephone call at 7:45 p.m. and think he may have left the gym to make it. Authorities are attempting to find the person he contacted, Moffatt said. Witnesses said he was dressed in black when he entered the class, shut off the lights, walked about 10 feet and began shooting. Mary Primis, 26, an aerobics instructor who is pregnant, was shot twice. ""I remember thinking I wanted to hold my breath because I was afraid, if he saw that I was breathing, he would shoot again,"" she told CNN affiliate WPXI from her hospital bed. Asked whether she thought she was going to die, she said, ""I wasn't sure."" Her husband, Alex Primis, told WPXI that she was shot once in the left shoulder and again through the back of her shoulder blade. Sodini did not mention killing himself in the note found at the scene, which was mostly typed with handwritten notations, but did mention it in a handwritten note found at his home, Moffatt said. Police seized Sodini's car for processing; no guns were found in it, he said. They also seized his computer and were examining it. Moffatt said he believed that none of the shooting victims who remained hospitalized Wednesday had life-threatening wounds. County officials said counselors were being made available to area residents in the wake of the shooting. Police spoke to a pastor mentioned on Sodini's online diary. The man said that Sodini had attended his church but stopped in 2006 and that there was a minor incident involving a woman who felt ""he was paying too much attention to her,"" Moffatt said. The pastor spoke to Sodini, and it stopped, he said. Moffatt said police have no knowledge of any mental health issues involving Sodini but are still puzzled at the violence.

"(CNN) -- Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson perhaps put it best. He said Ferguson, Missouri, was unknown to most of the world before August 9. That's the day Darren Wilson, a white police officer, shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black teen. The shooting prompted protests in the suburb of St. Louis, making it a flash point in the debate over race and policing in America. Suddenly, Ferguson had a place on the map. ""It has become a conversation throughout the world,"" said Johnson. Complete coverage of the events in Ferguson . Here's a look at key moments from that conversation: . AUGUST 9: THE SHOOTING . There are conflicting accounts as to exactly what happened the day of the shooting. Certain facts of the case, however, are clear: Wilson shot and killed Brown on August 9. The teen was unarmed. ONGOING: THE PROTESTS AND RESPONSE . Brown's death sent immediate shock waves through the community of Ferguson. Protests began the same day, and grew as time passed and news of the shooting spread. The vast majority of demonstrations were peaceful. However, there were pockets of looting and violence, which prompted a forceful -- protesters say excessive -- response from law enforcement. Authorities, who drove armored vehicles and wore military gear, were roundly criticized by members of the media, other law enforcement officials and demonstrators for escalating the violence, rather than tempering it. AUGUST 14: THE SHIFT IN SECURITY . In a bid to turn the tide, Gov. Jay Nixon put the Missouri Highway Patrol, and specifically Johnson, in charge of security. Nixon said he decided to tap state troopers because ""at this particular point, the attitudes weren't improving, and the blocks towards expression appeared to be a flash point."" Ferguson has looked ""more like a war zone, and it's not acceptable,"" the governor said. Johnson promised to take a different, more inclusive approach. He walked with protesters and was initially welcomed with open arms. Some of that good will soured after security forces under his command lobbed tear gas and stun grenades at rowdy protesters, who tossed rocks and Molotov cocktails at them. AUGUST 15: THE RELEASE OF SURVEILLANCE VIDEO AND THE OFFICER'S NAME . At the start, one of the protesters' main demands was that the name of the officer involved in the shooting be made public. Police eventually identified Wilson as the officer responsible. They did so the same day they released surveillance video of Brown at Ferguson Market and Liquor store. Minutes before the teen was shot, police said, a man fitting Brown's description allegedly stole cigars and roughed up a store clerk as cameras recorded. Release of the video angered some, who said police were using it to distract from Brown's killing and paint him in a negative light. Authorities have said Wilson stopped Brown not because of the theft, but because Brown and a friend were ""walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic."" AUGUST 15: THE OFFICER'S REPORTED ACCOUNT . The officer who killed Brown said the teenager rushed at him full speed in the moments before the shooting, according to an account phoned in to a St. Louis radio station and confirmed by a source with detailed knowledge of the investigation. According to the version on KFTK, phoned in by a woman who identified herself as ""Josie,"" the altercation began after Wilson rolled down his window to tell Brown and a friend to stop walking in the street. When Wilson tried to get out of his cruiser, Brown first tried to push the officer back into the car, then punched him in the face and grabbed for his gun before breaking free after the gun went off once, the caller said. Wilson pursued Brown and his friend, ordering them to freeze, according to the account. When they turned around, Brown began taunting Wilson, saying he would not arrest them, then ran at the officer at full speed, the caller said. Wilson then began shooting. The final shot was to Brown's forehead, and the teenager fell two or three feet in front of Wilson, said the caller, who identified herself as the officer's friend. AUGUST 20: THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S VISIT TO FERGUSON . Federal officials are conducting two civil rights investigations, one into Brown's killing and the other into the local police department's overall track record with minorities. The most high-profile figure in President Barack Obama's administration to visit Ferguson, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, stressed that the federal government is on the case and listening -- both to protesters calling for Wilson's arrest and for an end to what they describe as a heavy-handed police response, and to residents and law enforcement officers challenged with looting and violence from some in the crowd. ""The people of Ferguson can have confidence in the federal agents, investigators and prosecutors who are leading the process,"" Holder said. ""Our investigation will be fair, it will be thorough and it will be independent."" ""On a personal note,"" the African-American father of a teenage son told reporters, ""I've seen a lot in my time as attorney general, but few things have affected me as greatly as my visit to Ferguson."" SEPTEMBER 25: THE FERGUSON POLICE CHIEF'S APOLOGY . Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson issued a video apology to Brown's parents, as well as to any peaceful protesters who felt he didn't do ""enough to protect their constitutional right to protest."" Specifically, he apologized that it took investigating officers four hours to remove Brown's body from the street after Wilson shot him. ""I'm truly sorry for the loss of your son. I'm also sorry that it took so long to remove Michael from the street,"" he said. Later, Jackson said he had no intention of stepping down, despite many calls to do so, telling CNN, ""this is mine, and I'm taking ownership of it."" OCTOBER 21: THE AUTOPSY . Brown's gunshot wounds included a shot in the hand at close range, his official autopsy shows, according to an analysis reported by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper. A county official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN the autopsy document that the Post-Dispatch used to do its report is authentic. The detail could lend credence to Wilson's account that he and the unarmed African-American teenager scuffled at his patrol car before Brown was shot and killed. A private autopsy conducted for the Brown family showed the teen had been shot at least six times, including twice in the head. The official autopsy, as published by the Post-Dispatch, said Brown suffered six gunshot entrance wounds. INTERMITTENT: THE LEAKS IN THE CASE . Many details about the investigation have been leaked to the media and some, including Attorney General Holder, have accused the leakers of being selective. In addition to the autopsy information, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch published accounts of testimony presented to a St. Louis County grand jury. The Washington Post, meanwhile, reported that at least six black witnesses gave testimony that supported Wilson's side of the story. The New York Times said it received information from a federal source. Holder has called the leaks ""inappropriate and troubling"" because both the federal investigation and the grand jury proceedings are ongoing, according to a Justice official. ONGOING: THE GRAND JURY . Although the grand jury has until January to issue its ruling, the prosecutor's office has said a decision could come as early as mid-November. Whether or not it decides to indict Wilson, authorities have said they are planning for protests and possible violence. Police from various departments will operate as a unified command. The National Guard will be available as necessary. Law enforcement is prepared to extend shifts and limit leave, and additional resources have been distributed, Gov. Nixon has said. ""These measures are not being taken because we are convinced that violence will occur, but because we have a responsibility to prepare for any contingency,"" said the governor. He added: ""This is America. People have a right to express their views and grievances, but they do not have the right to put their fellow citizens or their property at risk."" CNN's Michael Pearson, Steve Almasy, Eliott C. McLaughlin, Holly Yan and Evan Perez contributed to this report.","Michael Brown, a black teen, was shot August 9 by a white police officer .

"After years spent fighting in some of the world's worst wars, former U.S. Navy SEAL Kristin Beck says she knows what she wants. ""I want to have my life,"" she told CNN's ""AC360."" ""I fought for 20 years for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I want some happiness."" Beck recently came out as transgender. She wrote about the experience in a book, ""Warrior Princess: A U.S. Navy SEAL's Journey to Coming out Transgender."" Trapped in a man's body . As a man named Christopher Beck, she deployed as a SEAL 13 times, including operations in Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere. Along the way, Beck earned a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. Identifying herself as a woman, Beck has felt trapped in the wrong body since grade school, but didn't come out until after leaving the military in 2011. Doing so earlier would have been too big a risk because in the United States, transgender men and women are banned from military service. ""That's a chance that -- if I took it -- I might be dead today,"" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper last year. The CNN Film, ""Lady Valor: The Kristin Beck Story,"" offers a fascinating glimpse of Beck's life. ""I just wanted to tell someone my story,"" she says in the film.  ""And maybe set an example for some of the younger generation -- just say that I'm still a human being, and I deserve dignity and respect."" Beck says she deals with ""a lot of prejudice out there. There's been a lot of transgender people who are killed for prejudice, for hatred. When the book came out -- some amazing support and some amazing praises -- but also some pretty amazing bigotry and hatred."" In the film, Beck talks candidly about how she reacts to prejudice. ""I just try to be friendly, and I just say 'Hi, how are you doing?' You know, 'Good to meet you. I was that Navy SEAL, you know, transgender, you might've seen me on TV.' And they go, 'Oh, oh wow.'  And then they realize that maybe trying to get into a fight with me wouldn't be a good idea. Maybe they should be nice."" Beck says she doesn't need people to love, or even like, her. ""But I don't want you to beat me up and kill me. You don't have to like me, I don't care. But please don't kill me."" 'No one ever met the real me' Beck explained her years of hiding as living like an onion. Deep down, under various layers, or skins, she hid her female persona. ""It is a constant, but as you suppress and as you bottle it up, it's not like on that surface,"" she told Cooper. ""You would never notice it because I can push it so deep, but then it does kinda, like, it gnaws at you. So it's always there."" In the film, Beck pulls back the curtain on her unique childhood, when she used to pretend to be sick so she could stay home from school and indulge in her secret. ""I would put nail polish on. I could have, you know, a pair of my sister's shoes on,"" Beck said. ""It was like a reset, it was like a vacation for me.  So I had my vacation away from Chris."" Beck believes she might have wanted to become a SEAL because they are ""the toughest of the tough."" She thought: ""I could totally make it go away if I could be at that top level. ... Maybe I could cure myself."" But the feeling of being born in the wrong body never went away. And for her entire military career, Beck kept her secret. She said virtually no one, out of the thousands of people she worked with, knew the truth -- it was so well hidden. ""No one ever met the real me,"" she said. 'True brotherhood' Though her identity was hidden, the rest of what Beck offered was true. ""I gave true brotherhood. I did my best, 150% all the time, and I gave strength and honor and my full brotherhood to every military person I ever worked with."" Beck married a woman and had children. ""I was just trying to fit in to the stereotype American dream, exactly what my parents and everyone expected of me,"" Beck says in the film.  ""I met someone who's -- who's awesome, you know, we got along good."" Beck chose to reveal the secret to her wife slowly, to ""see what the acceptance level"" was. ""She wasn't totally digging it. So she had no idea what she was getting into. Definitely wasn't the top on her list of things that she wanted, so it hurt."" As much of mainstream America learns more about what it means to be transgender, Beck says even she is still trying to figure out some aspects for herself.

"The remains of all 44 Malaysian passengers of Flight MH17 have been identified, a government statement says. MH17 was en route from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on July 17 when it was apparently shot down by a missile as it flew over Ukraine. All 298 people on board were killed, including 15 Malaysian crew members. The last Malaysian identified was Allahyarhamah Puan Sri Siti Amirah Prawira Kusuma, who will be buried in the Netherlands at the request of her family, according to a statement from Malaysian Transport Minister Dato' Sri Liow Tiong Lai. ""During this difficult time, the families of the passengers and crew of MH17 remain foremost on our minds and we continue to keep them in our prayer,"" he said. ""I wish to reiterate our commitment to the families of the passengers and crew of MH17 and the fact that justice must be served on the criminals who caused this heinous act. Towards this end, investigations at the crash site must continue despite the on-going geopolitical situation on the ground."" The United States and Ukraine have accused pro-Russian separatists operating in the region of downing the plane with a missile, a charge the rebels have denied. A preliminary report by the Dutch Safety Board in September supported that theory, saying the plane was hit by ""high-energy objects,"" but it did not cast blame. About two-thirds of those killed were Dutch, with Malaysians and Australians making up a large proportion of the others.

"Republican opponents of White House-backed legislation that would rein in NSA surveillance programs narrowly blocked the Senate from taking up the bill Tuesday after warning it could help terrorists escape detection. On a tally of 58 to 42, a procedural vote failed to get the supermajority 60 votes it needed to advance. Supporters of the USA Freedom Act, a rare mix of liberal Democrats and libertarian Republicans, hoped public outrage over the secret mass collection of phone and Internet records -- revealed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden -- would lead to passage of the reforms.  But many opponents argued the changes would hamper the National Security Agency's ability to track nimble and elusive terrorists. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell led the charge against the bill, saying the new rules would prevent the United States from capturing the terrorists who killed Peter Kassig, a U.S. citizen doing aid work in Syria. Kassig was executed over the weekend. ""Many of these fighters are familiar with America's intelligence capabilities, and many are savvy with communications. These are terrorists who know how to use encryption, and they how to change devices quickly,"" he said. ""This is the worst time to be tying our hands behind our backs."" ""It basically takes us back to a pre-9/11 lack of capacity to identify terrorists making telephone calls in the United States, said Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the second-ranking Senate Republican.  ""I think that sort of unilateral disarmament would be bad for the country."" McConnell also argued the measure should be debated and voted on in the new Congress next year, not by lawmakers in a lame duck session who are leaving Washington. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, the bill's principal author, disputed the critics saying that while it puts checks on the NSA's powerful capabilities, it ""does so responsibly."" ""The bill contains key reforms to safeguard Americans' privacy by prohibiting the indiscriminate collection of their data.  It also provides for greater accountability and transparency of the government's surveillance programs,"" he said.  ""The bill also ensures that the intelligence community has the tools it needs to keep our country safe."" Under the bill, the government could no longer store massive amounts of call information in its databases, a practice President Barack Obama said he wanted to end.  That job would fall to the large telecommunication companies.  But the government could get permission from a secret surveillance court to review specific call information if it could show it might be linked to terrorists. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, said this arrangement ""solves"" a ""very practical problem"" raised by those who are uncomfortable with the government storing calling records of Americans. But Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said the public's privacy would be better protected by strict federal government safeguards of that information than by the thousands of employees at private phone companies. In a statement Monday, the White House urged passage of the bill. ""This legislation will help strengthen Americans' confidence in the government's use of these important national security authorities.  Without passage of this bill, critical authorities that are appropriately reformed in this legislation could expire next summer.  The administration urges Congress to take action on this legislation now, since delay may subject these important national security authorities to brinksmanship and uncertainty."" The bill is supported by a coalition of technology companies, including Google, Apple, AOL, Microsoft and Yahoo, who have deep concerns that their customers' privacy is being violated by the current NSA techniques. Supporters suffered a setback last week when Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, who had favored the measure, announced he would not back it.  However, other like-minded Republicans such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah voted to advance the bill.","Supporters of bill that would curb NSA fail to get supermajority of 60 votes .

"(CNN) -- Missouri protesters Friday turned their anger over the police shooting death of unarmed teen Michael Brown on the St. Louis Galleria Mall, forcing it to shut down temporarily on the busiest shopping day of the year. Demonstrations spanned the country, from service disruptions at an Oakland, California, transit station to a march outside Macy's Herald Square store in New York. Protesters in Seattle clashed with authorities on Friday as well. Police said they used pepper spray against demonstrators and said some were throwing flares. At least five people were arrested, according to authorities. The city went ahead with a Christmas tree lighting ceremony not far from where protests are being held. ""We need to get some police presence up here. Kids, don't worry,"" someone said over a loudspeaker at the ceremony, trying to reassure the families in attendance. ""You are much better mannered than they are."" CNN affiliate KING posted video of the clash on Twitter. In a nearby mall, dozens of demonstrators marched and chanted slogans that have been associated with Ferguson-related protests: ""Hands up, don't shoot,"" ""No justice, no peace"" and ""Who are we? Mike Brown."" Seattle Mayor Ed Murray released a statement urging nonviolence by protesters. ""While I understand the hurt and frustration that our city has experienced in the past days, this is a city that respects the rule of law,"" he said in a statement. ""I support the First Amendment rights of protestors, but violence against property or police officers will not be tolerated in our city."" In St. Louis, officials urged Galleria retailers to bring down security gates after several hundred protesters entered the mall and disrupted shopping. One mall worker said demonstrators threatened to throw chairs in the food court before the National Guard moved in. The mall reopened later Friday. Protesters chanted ""hands up, don't shoot,"" according to CNN affiliate KMOV. At times, protesters would stop and lie on the floor of the Galleria Mall in a ""die-in."" Demonstrators also interrupted Black Friday shopping at Target and Walmart stores in the area, the station reported. In Oakland, major delays were reported Friday at the BART West Oakland train station because of ""civil unrest,"" according to a service advisory. There was no service into or out of San Francisco. Protesters chanted ""Which side are you on?"" and ""Black lives matter"" as BART police officers attempted to remove them from trains. Some demonstrators chained themselves to handrails on the trains, forcing police to remove the handrails. About a half-dozen demonstrators were arrested. Quiet in Ferguson . The disruptions came as Ferguson streets were largely deserted after a Thanksgiving that mixed kindness with sadness, heartbreak with hope. Gone were the blazing buildings, set on fire during the most contentious nights of protests this week. So were the stone-faced National Guard troops, standing in a single file, facing angry protesters. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon announced Friday that approximately $625,000 in zero-interest loan funding would be made available to businesses affected by the unrest in Ferguson and some surrounding areas. ""Communities that have been impacted by civil unrest should know that the State of Missouri is committed to providing the resources necessary for them to recover and rebuild,"" Nixon said in a news release. Nixon later announced that he plans to call a special session of the Missouri General Assembly in order to provide funding for security measures in Ferguson. The state's financial obligations are ""on track to exceed the current appropriate authority for emergency duties,"" according to a statement from Nixon's office. Though troops remained on duty, residents -- instead of hurling insults -- spread some goodwill, bringing National Guard members turkey and other treats. ""We just all have to make sure that we are taking care of one another,"" Terry Pimmel told CNN affiliate KSDK. ""That is our mission."" Bundled-up volunteers painted murals on plywood covering gaping holes where windows once stood, a stark reminder of vandalism of stores a few days ago. ""We came out here because we thought that anything would be better than just blank plywood,"" Avi Ryan, 13, told CNN affiliate KMOV. And for Brown's family, it was the first Thanksgiving without him. Relatives gathered at his father's house, where an empty chair sat at the dining table. A shirt with the words ""Gone Too Soon"" was draped over the chair while his father, Michael Brown Sr., stood nearby wearing a shirt with the word ""Justice."" The younger Brown, 18, was fatally shot in August by Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson. A grand jury's decision Monday not to indict Wilson sparked protests in the St. Louis suburb that spread from coast to coast. Black Friday boycott . Protesters urged supporters to boycott shopping on Black Friday. And if they did shop, they were told to take their money to black-owned businesses, some of which they listed on social media. Supporters had been urged to boycott major retailers nationwide. About 300 protesters gathered outside Macy's in New York for a march Friday afternoon. Carrying signs with messages such as ""We will not be silent"" and ""Ferguson is everywhere,"" about a dozen protesters entered the department store and were followed by police. Others marched north toward Times Square. Organizers said they were protesting everything from the Ferguson grand jury decision to racial profiling. At least seven protesters have been arrested on various charges, including impeding traffic and disorderly conduct, according to police. Celebration postponed . Ferguson has postponed its annual Northern Lights celebration, which was scheduled for Sunday. The event includes a parade and the lighting of a Christmas tree. ""The decision was difficult, but ultimately, all involved felt postponing the event is the most appropriate course of action at this time,"" the city said in a statement. Policing in a post-Ferguson U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder will travel to Atlanta on Monday to hold the first in a series of meetings focused on race relations and policing in minority communities, according to CNN justice reporter Evan Perez. Holder's announcement comes just days after President Barack Obama promised regional meetings that would focus on ""building trust in our communities."" ""For the overwhelming majority of people who just feel frustrated and pained because they get a sense that maybe some communities aren't treated fairly or some individuals aren't seen as as worthy as others, I understand that, and I want to work with you,"" Obama said Tuesday. Holder plans to have about five of these meetings across the nation. CNN's Evan Perez, Eric Bradner, Leigh Remizowski and Shimon Prokupecz contributed to this report.","Seattle demonstrators clash with authorities at Christmas tree lighting .

"(CNN)Deciding to move on after his beloved German shepherd was stolen from his backyard 18 months ago wasn't easy for Richard Brower. ""I never gave up hope,"" Brower said, ""I'd just come to the realization that I couldn't go on without another dog."" He'd enlisted the help of his motorcycle-riding buddies and nearly everyone from the dog park in the search.  Anyone seen walking a German shepherd had been, at one time, accosted by him or his friends.  His searches were fruitless. ""It was heartbreaking,"" Brower said.  ""Absolutely horrible."" His heart-wrenching decision to search for a new dog -- made after a year-and-a-half of endless searching for Dozer -- turned out to be the best decision he could've made, as it led him back to his best friend in a miraculous way. ""It's the closest thing to a miracle in my life,"" he said. Brower typed ""German shepherds for sale"" into an Internet browser, which led him first to Claresholm Animal Rescue Society.  He clicked the link and shivers went down his spine. ""My heart stopped,"" Brower said,  ""the second I opened the page."" Staring back at him on the rescue's website was his dog, Dozer, the pup's head cocked to the side, just as he remembered. Brower said he never doubted that it was his dog, but he sent the picture to his mom and sister for their opinion.  His sister agreed it was Dozer, but his mom was doubtful.  Brower said she was likely trying to save her son from unnecessary heartbreak, in case it wasn't him. Brower called the shelter and reached Sylvia Giroux at Claresholm, Alberta.  While on the phone, Brower's dad, returning home from a business trip, stopped at the shelter, unbeknownst to his son. Brower said Dozer immediately started wagging his tail when his father came into the room.  Still on the phone, Brower instructed his dad to snap his fingers once and then tell him what the dog did. He snapped and Dozer, a super well-trained dog who knows how to open and close doors and turn on lights, circled Brower's dad and sat on his right hand side, waiting for his next command. ""There was no boo-hooing, but it was close,"" Giroux said, ""It was just such a wonderful thing."" Giroux might've kept it together, but Brower said everyone else was a different story. ""My dad was bawling, I was bawling on the phone,"" he said. And when Dozer got home -- there was more crying -- from Dozer. ""He almost knocked me over,"" Brower said. ""He came flying in, put his head into my arm and started doing that wailing that German shepherds do."" Other than his having lived at the shelter for a month after he was picked up by a resident nearby, Brower doesn't know much about Dozer's whereabouts during the 18 months he was missing.  He's just thrilled to have his pup, who he calls a ""big sweet baby,"" back at home, back to normal. Normal, except for at the dog park, where families used to steer clear of the 125-pound pooch. ""Now that he's a celebrity, everyone wants to hug him,"" Brower said. Dog rides bus to dog park .","Richard Brower's dog was stolen from his backyard 18 months ago .

"America's contentious and costly war in Iraq officially ended Thursday with an understated ceremony in Baghdad that contrasted sharply with its thundering start almost nine years ago. U.S. troops lowered the flag of command that flew over the Iraqi capital, carefully rolled it and cased it in camouflage in accordance with Army tradition. The quiet ceremony, under a bright Iraqi sun, was the opposite of the nighttime ""shock and awe"" bombardment of Baghdad that launched the war against Saddam Hussein in March 2003. Justified by President George W. Bush on the grounds that Hussein was seeking weapons of mass destruction that he could share with terrorists such as al Qaeda, the invasion cased deep divisions in America and around the world. CNN Photos: Looking back at 8 years of war in Iraq . After that, men and women from Maine to Hawaii began crossing the border into Iraq -- and began dying or coming home with lifelong injuries. Hussein's regime proved easy to topple, but no weapons of mass destruction were found, and the United States and its allies were left occupying a country where they were not greeted as liberators, despite the prediction of Bush's vice president, Dick Cheney. Iraq erupted into sectarian violence, leaving U.S. troops to try to contain what threatened to become a civil war. Improvised explosive device became a household term, traumatic brain injuries a signature wound of the war. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, who flew into Baghdad for Thursday's flag-lowering ceremony, recalled that when he visited in 2006 as a member of Bush's Iraq Study Group, ""sectarian violence was skyrocketing, and it seemed as if nothing was working."" But, he said, ""After a lot of blood spilled by Iraqis and Americans, the mission of an Iraq that could govern and secure itself has become real."" On Thursday, the Iraq war officially ended as President Barack Obama described it: not with a final battle but with a final march home for U.S. troops. In all, the United States spent more than $800 billion in Iraq. Panetta reflected on a greater cost. He said the United States was ""deeply indebted"" to all Americans in uniform. Nearly 4,500 of them were killed in this war, more than 30,000 wounded. In their own words: Eight lives changed by the Iraq war . And he hailed the advances made in Iraq since Hussein was ousted. ""This is a time for Iraq to look forward,"" he said. ""This is an opportunity for Iraq to forge ahead on a path to security and prosperity. We owe it to all of the lives that were sacrificed in this war not to fail."" No one knows how many Iraqis have been killed since March 2003, but the independent public database Iraq Body Count has compiled reports of more than 150,000 between the invasion and October 2010, with four out of five dead being civilians. Thousands of other Iraqis struggle to cope with lives marred by war. For them, the battle goes on as the Americans leave behind a fragile nation struggling to establish democracy, struggling to establish stability. Violence still claims innocent lives in Iraq. People are frustrated with the lack of electricity. Baghdad is awash in trash. No one can predict Iraq's future without the presence of Americans. ""As long as there are assassinations and explosions from time to time in this country, then of course I have fears,"" said ministry of transportation employee Abu Hadeel. ""When I walk in a crowded street, I have concern of any sudden explosion. There are no guarantees."" Student Moutazz Sami said Iraq was not prepared militarily or politically to handle challenges. But businessman Ethar Mohammed said ""every beginning has an end."" ""The political divisions are huge and no one knows what will happen after December 31,"" the date by which American troops must leave, said Iraqi journalist Mina al-Oraibi, assistant editor-in-chief of Asharq Alawsat newspaper in London. Fareed Zakaria on Iraq's oil potential . All U.S. troops must be out of Iraq by the end of this month after Washington and Baghdad failed to agree on terms under which they could remain. At the height of the war in 2007, when Bush ordered a so-called surge, more than 170,000 American troops were stationed in Iraq, living on more than 500 bases and outposts across the nation. As of Tuesday, only 5,500 American troops remained. A senior defense official traveling with Panetta said that some troops -- perhaps 3,000 to 4,000 -- will remain in Kuwait for a certain period of time but said the details have not been worked out with the Kuwaitis. Only half of Americans think their nation achieved its goals in Iraq, according to a CNN/ORC International poll conducted last month. Still, 61% favored the withdrawal of all troops by the end of the year. And 68% said they opposed the war in Iraq. Opinion: I'm grateful my husband served in Afghanistan, not Iraq . Iraqis, on the other hand, are worried that the United States wants to disengage from their country entirely, al-Oraibi said, pointing out that Obama came to office partly on the strength of his opposition to the war and sent Vice President Joe Biden to visit recently rather than coming himself. But Brett McGurk, a former adviser to three U.S. ambassadors, pointed out that U.S. disengagement has been a process, rather than a sudden action. Iraq, he said, has been in charge of its own security since 2009. ""It's not like we were controlling Iraq's security situation last week, and now we're suddenly leaving,"" he said. ""We haven't had troops in Baghdad for over two years."" Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, explained in practical terms what the end of the U.S. military mission meant. Departing from his prepared text, he said he had been able to fly into Iraq on this occasion simply because he wanted to do so. ""The next time I come here, I'm going to have to be invited by the Iraqi government, and I kind of like that,"" Dempsey said before concluding his speech with thanks and a blessing in Arabic. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the United States will help the people ""realize their own ambitions for a free and sovereign Iraq."" It also will work closely with the Iraqi government to ensure the safety of U.S. civilians staying in the country, she said. ""I think it's understood this is one of the most challenging missions that the State Department has ever led, but we've had a great deal of thought given to what needs to be accomplished,"" Clinton said in Washington. Back home, many of those Americans who sacrificed in Iraq harbor mixed feelings about the war. But if Iraq can emerge as a free and democratic nation, every American soldier should feel proud, said retired Army Gen. Mark Kimmitt. ""If that's the case, then these soldiers can say, yes, indeed, they won,"" he said. ""Every soldier and their families should walk away extremely satisfied and proud of what they accomplished and what they left behind. I just hope it can remain that way."" Obama laid out that same message as he welcomed home returning troops Wednesday at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. ""Because of you, because you sacrificed so much for a people that you had never met, Iraqis have a chance to forge their own destiny,"" Obama said. ""That's part of what makes us special as Americans. Unlike the empires of old, we did so not for territory or for resources. We do it because it's right. Obama said there was no fuller expression of U.S. support for self-determination than its withdrawal from Iraq. That, he said, speaks volumes for the American people.","U.S. committed to assisting Iraq, Clinton says .

"The eruption of fighting in Iraq's Anbar Province is causing much consternation and recrimination in U.S. foreign policy circles. Conservative hawks, including Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham, are especially vocal in criticizing the Obama administration's Iraq policy. They argue that the administration's fecklessness has opened Iraq to an al Qaeda offensive that now has the terrorist group's flag flying over portions of Falluja and Ramadi, two cities subdued during the Bush administration at great cost in blood and treasure. If Obama had not foolishly withdrawn the remaining U.S. troops from Iraq at the end of 2011, hawkish critics insist, Washington would now have far greater ability to prevent the country's alarming slide into turmoil. There are several problems with that argument. First, it was Bush, not Obama, who negotiated the original agreement with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki that promised the full withdrawal of U.S. forces by the end of 2011. The Obama administration would have had either to renege on a formal agreement, thus displaying contempt for the sovereignty of a democratic Iraq that the United States helped create, or somehow induce the al-Maliki government to sign a new agreement allowing American troops to remain. Second, Obama administration officials did try to negotiate a new ""status of forces"" agreement to enable a limited number of troops (perhaps 10,000 to 20,000) to stay in Iraq. However, al-Maliki insisted the only way he would even consider approving such a pact would be if Washington agreed that U.S. forces were subject to Iraqi law. The U.S. government, under both Republican and Democratic presidents, has been wary of consenting to such provisions even in stable, Western democratic countries that host American troops. The United States has steadfastly refused to do so in countries like Iraq with shaky, corrupt political systems and dubious legal systems. One ought to ask hawks if they believe Obama should have exposed American military personnel to the tender mercies of Iraq's court system. If not, they must concede that Obama adopted the right position in refusing to make such a concession. Third, the idea of keeping U.S. troops in Iraq was profoundly unpopular among both Iraqis and Americans. Public opinion polls taken in 2011 showed a clear majority of Americans believed the Iraq War was a mistake and did not want U.S. forces to stay in that country. Likewise, by rather wide margins, Sunni and Shiite Arab populations (who vehemently disagreed about numerous issues) were in agreement on one point: They wanted all foreign forces out of their country. The only faction that favored a continued U.S. military presence was the Kurdish population in the north. Even then, the primary reason the Kurds wanted troops to remain was to help prevent Baghdad from trying to suppress Kurdistan's increasingly bold de facto independence. Keeping U.S. forces in Iraq would have put American personnel on the front lines of that tense, emotional confrontation. Those troops would today also be on the front lines of an even nastier confrontation between al-Maliki's Shiite-led government and Sunni insurgents in Anbar. It is a grotesque oversimplification to assume that al Qaeda is the source of all the trouble there. Even before the latest fighting broke out, bloodshed in Iraq was on the rise. The death toll from political (mainly Sunni-Shiite sectarian) violence in 2013 was the highest in five years. With an ostentatiously independent Kurdistan in the north, and now a direct military challenge from the Sunni heartland to al-Maliki's rule, Iraq shows signs of extreme instability, if not impending fragmentation. Critics who blast Obama for not keeping American troops in that snake pit are badly misguided. They cling to the notion that Washington's decision to invade and occupy Iraq was a great success until Obama administration blunders undercut that achievement. It may be a comforting delusion to hawks, but it is a delusion. We should all be grateful that Washington is no longer in a position to add new American military victims to the toll of more than 4,400 who already perished.","Fighting in Iraq's Anbar Province causes consternation among policy leaders .

"(CNN)As the huge plume of black smoke fills the sky, people react with shock and confusion. Some run to try to tackle small blazes, others stand and stare. Captured on what appears to be a cellphone video, the scene is believed to be the immediate aftermath of the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in eastern Ukraine four months ago. The footage emerged online over the weekend, just as the removal of wreckage from the crash site for an international investigation finally began. The video was posted on YouTube by the Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, which said it depicts the moments after the passenger jet came down. It shows fire raging in field with bits of wreckage strewn nearby. Tongue-lashing for Putin at G20 . Flight 17 was shot down on July 17 with 298 people on board over territory controlled by pro-Russian separatists. The dispute over who is responsible for the disaster continues to taint relations between Moscow and the West. The United States and other Western nations have accused the pro-Russian separatists of shooting down the plane with a Russian surface-to-air missile. But Moscow and the rebels have claimed Ukrainian forces were responsible. The continuing disagreement, as well as Russia's broader interference in Ukraine, prompted bouts of strong criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin by Western leaders at the G20 summit in Australia over the weekend. Putin left the event earlier than his fellow world leaders Sunday, saying he had to rest before a busy Monday. But he described the discussions at the summit as ""constructive."" He also expressed the view that the Ukraine crisis ""has good chances for resolution."" Ukraine prepared for 'total war' His comments contrast with the words coming from the Ukrainian government in Kiev, amid reports that Russian troops and weapons are moving into eastern Ukraine. ""We are prepared for a scenario of total war,"" Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko reportedly told the German newspaper Bild. ""We don't want war, we want peace and we are fighting for European values. But Russia does not respect any agreement."" Moscow has repeatedly denied accusations from Kiev and Western governments that it has sent forces into eastern Ukraine to bolster the rebels. A ceasefire agreement reached in September between the Ukrainian government and the separatists no longer appears to have any connection with the reality on the ground. Exchanges of mortar fire are common in eastern Ukraine. Residents in the shattered town of Debaltseve told CNN's Phil Black that artillery fired by both sides falls there almost every day, often destroying homes. Removal of MH17 wreckage . Amid the chaotic conflict, Dutch investigators have been trying to recover the wreckage from MH17. Everyone aboard the flight was killed. Around two-thirds of the victims were from the Netherlands. The vast crash site was left unsecured, and international investigators struggled to reach the area as fighting raged. The removal of the wreckage began Sunday and continued Monday, the Dutch Safety Board said. It is expected to take several days. The wreckage will be transported by train to the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv before being flown to the Netherlands. The investigators say they intend to reconstruct a section of the aircraft to help determine what happened. Further investigation needed . In its preliminary report in September on the disaster, the Dutch agency said Flight 17 broke apart in the air after it was hit by a burst of ""high-energy objects"" from outside. That report set out a list of areas that still need further investigation, including forensic examination of wreckage and any foreign objects found. It noted at the time that Dutch investigators still hadn't been able to visit the site amid the unstable situation in eastern Ukraine. In the aftermath of the crash, the rebels were widely accused of looting the site, tampering with the evidence and stopping investigators from combing through the wreckage. After an initial delay, most of the bodies of the victims have been removed from the area and transported out of Ukraine. But as recently as September, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said it was likely that there were still remains strewn across the fields. Australia had 38 of its citizens and residents on the plane. Passenger found wearing oxygen mask .","A video that emerged over the weekend purportedly shows the crash's aftermath .

"Lately, Dan McMullen has been bringing an extra gun to his office in Ferguson, Missouri. McMullen runs Solo Insurance on West Florissant close to where looting and vandalism briefly broke out in early August after a police officer shot to death teenager Michael Brown. ""I bring an extra gun now only because it has a bigger magazine,"" McMullen says. He began carrying it after tensions increased in the area following the shooting. He says he would never use it to protect his business, but he would use it to save his life. ""So maybe I get trapped here or something and have to have a John Wayne shootout,"" McMullen says before interrupting himself, smiling. ""That's the silly part about it: Is that going to happen? Not a chance. But I guess, could it? I'm the only white person here."" McMullen is particularly cautious now, as all of Ferguson and much of the nation waits to see whether a grand jury will indict Officer Darren Wilson for the shooting. Though the grand jury has until January to issue its ruling, the prosecutor's office has said a decision could come in mid-November. McMullen warns others considering getting a gun not to be reckless. When his adult son told him he wanted a gun to protect himself after the grand jury decision, McMullen warned him not to rush into it. ""People like him need to think about it, and not think about 'I'm worried about this stuff,' "" McMullen says. On Monday, Steven King, who owns Metro Shooting Supplies, told CNN that customers bought 100 guns this weekend. A typical weekend brings in about 30 buyers. ""People are afraid they are gonna throw Molotov cocktails,"" says King, referring to the mostly nonviolent protests that have taken place in Ferguson since the shooting. The increase in gun sales reaches across racial and ethnic lines, he says. ""A lot of black people are coming in saying they are afraid of the hooliganism,"" he says. ""But not all of Ferguson is hooliganish. The media portrays us that way. If the world can just see this is one little street in Ferguson going crazy, they'd understand that we're not just one big burning city."" At Metro Shooting Range in nearby Bridgeton, Missouri, manager John Stephenson says gun sales are up 40 to 50% as of last week. And lots of folks are coming in to the gun range for training, which he says is important for new gun owners. ""Every time that door opens, we're seeing new faces,"" Stephenson says. Many new customers tell him they're concerned about the response to the grand jury decision. The bulk of the weapons sold to new buyers are home defense shotguns. ""We've sold tons,"" he says. Ferguson Mayor James Knowles says a good number of residents have told him they're buying guns for protection. The mayor has warned law enforcement to be mindful that there are a flurry of new gun owners. ""It is a little frightening to think that somebody who is less trained may not have that restraint."" A gun owner himself, Knowles says gun ownership is a responsibility that should not be taken lightly. Brown's parents push U.N. for 'global intervention' into U.S. policing . Preparing for a hurricane . Just down the street from the Ferguson Police Department, hair salon owner Constance Garnett is praying for the best, but her brothers are helping her prepare for the worst. The shop she's run for 11 years, Taste of Honey, on South Florissant, now looks like it's ready for a hurricane, completely boarded up. She takes one look at her shop and shakes her head at the sight. ""It's hurtful, it's really, really hurtful,"" Garnett says over the sound of hammers and drills behind her. ""We don't have the constant flow of customers that we normally have coming through here because everybody is afraid."" But some protesters say that fear is unfounded, that violence and crime among the protesters has been minimal. Bassem Masri, who can be found on any given night verbally lashing out at police, says it is unfair to call the protests violent. They are simply loud, he says. Masri claims to say whatever he wants to police and believes they should be trained to take it. ""As far as what's happened within the last 90 days, people would know if you had been paying attention. There hasn't been any looting or violence or whatnot. We've been keeping it peaceful and they are just worried about us using our freedom of speech such as we've been doing. And we've been pushing the limits on that if it's even possible to do that."" In the early days in August, police were roundly criticized for their aggressive militarized response. Now they tend to stand strong, but not react in the face of verbal abuse and on the few occasions where water bottles have been thrown at them. But police have faced threats. Exhaustion and frustration among them is high. ""It only takes one in 10 with bad intentions to make the entire situation spiral out of control,"" says Sgt. Brian Schellman with the St. Louis County Police Department. ""A few protesters take it above and beyond not just aimed at police anymore but sometimes these threats are going against police officers' families."" Wilson, a 28-year-old white police officer, shot and killed the 18-year-old Brown, who was African-American, in a confrontation on August 9. Since then there have been protests every single day outside the Ferguson Police Department calling for his arrest and indictment. In this normally quiet town of 21,200, the majority of people -- those who support Wilson and those who think he should be arrested -- do not believe he will be indicted.  Though the daily protests have been mostly peaceful since the shooting, few doubt that some level of violence will follow if there is no indictment. Robert McCulloch, the prosecuting attorney for St. Louis County, said Monday that his office will announce when a decision has been reached by the grand jury and cautioned that until that decision is released, any claims made on social media ""should be ignored."" McMullen, the insurance company owner, hates to see the business that he's run for 20 years look the way it does. ""I hate the boards,"" he says. But he obliged his landlord who offered to install them. ""I don't like them here, but I don't want my windows smashed out either,"" he says. McMullen is one of the few white business owners in this part of Ferguson. He says he knows most residents just want to speak their minds without violence, but he says it's ""the crazies"" that worry him. ""People who aren't afraid are stupid because fear keeps your mind alert and keeps yourself protected,"" McMullen says.  And for him, so does the concealed weapon he carries. Ferguson mayor sees possible protests in region when grand jury decides . Fighting the fear . On the surface, it looks like David Royal is boarding up and cleaning out an old Ponderosa restaurant on West Florissant Road. Instead, he's renovating it. ""We can change the face of Ferguson, and that's what we're doing here,"" Royal says. He and a handful of volunteers, some of them also protesters, worked hand in hand with Mayor Knowles for a day to turn the old boarded up building into the Center for Hope and Peace. When it opens, Royal says the Center will help local residents with job training and plug them into existing social services. ""Even though we have some bumps in the road, we stick together,"" Royal says. Steps away, at a strip mall with more boards than windows, the Burger Bar and More restaurant stands out.  Not just for its signature Garbage Burger, topped with a fried egg, but also because it's one of the few on West Florissant that is not boarded up. The owner, Charles Davis, opened the restaurant the day before Brown was killed. ""I want to make a statement to the community,"" Davis says. ""I'm here, I'm open and I'm not going anywhere."" He suffered through the first round of protests and he plans to stand firm no matter what the future holds. ""I refused to shut down then, I refuse to shut down now,"" Davis says. ""I fear only one thing: God.""","Shop owner Constance Garnett has boarded up her salon .
She says she fears the response to the grand jury decision .

"Legazpi, Philippines (CNN) -- Typhoon Hagupit lost some strength as it spiraled northwest through the Philippines on Sunday, but its hulking presence threatened more damage and evoked frightening memories, 13 months after deadly Typhoon Haiyan blasted the same region. ""Last year, many people were asking, 'Is it the will of God, or the wrath of God?' But now, they just feel it is part of nature,"" the Rev. Eliodoro Reteracion of Tacloban's Redemptorist Church said. While Haiyan killed more than 6,000 people, the Philippine government is blaming only two deaths on Hagupit so far. On Monday morning, the storm weakened further and was downgraded to a tropical storm by the U.S. military's Joint Typhoon Warning Center. One-year-old Thea Rojo and Ernesto Baylon, 55, both of Iloilo province in the central Philippines, died from hypothermia in the storm, National Disaster Risk Reduction Council executive director Alexander Pama told a press briefing on Sunday. More than 900,000 people from nearly 200,000 families have been adversely affected by the cyclone, locally known as ""Ruby,"" Pama said. Almost all of them have sought help at evacuation centers. CNN meteorologist Michael Guy forecast that Hagupit would move west on Monday, just south of the capital city of Manila, with strong winds and potentially devastating rains. The storm, which has battered several regions of the Philippines since Saturday, poses dangers of flooding and landslides from a volcano. A day after Hagupit made landfall on Samar Island, the massive cyclone crept across the country Sunday at about 15 kph (9 mph). That sluggish pace means Hagupit had more time to dump relentless rainfall over the same areas, making severe flooding a possibility. What's worse: the storm passed not far from the Mayon Volcano. Officials are now keeping an eye on the volcano, known for its almost perfectly symmetrical cone shape, because heavy rainfall could mix with the volcanic ash and spur major landslides. Not only could the force of a landslide wreak havoc on homes, the debris could go into streams, rivers and reservoirs around the volcano, blocking them up and causing even more flooding. Millions affected . About 40 million people are close to the path of the storm and its fierce winds, which reached 160 kph (100 mph) Sunday. Lucrecia Simbajon of Magallanes is one of those who evacuated to a local church. ""I don't know how long I'm going to be here, as the roof was blown off my house last night,"" she said Sunday morning. Her home -- a typical wooden and metal shack -- was already wiped out last year. After Typhoon Haiyan, she spent more than 20 days at the church, lying between pews with her children. Despite the potential danger, some residents in Legazpi, in the shadow of the Mayon Volcano, ignored evacuation orders and vowed to stay in their makeshift beachside homes. ""I think we can handle the situation,"" one man said. ""If or when it gets worse, we'll go to the evacuation center."" A woman who lives on the coast was also defiant. ""We've been here 25 years and seen many typhoons,"" she said. ""This one already feels stronger than Typhoon Haiyan (last year), but we won't leave yet."" Gen. Gregorio Catapang, chief of staff of armed forces, said Sunday that soldiers were working to clear roads and airports so that emergency services could be delivered. Eleven nations had offered assistance, including Australia, the United States, China, Japan and the United Kingdom. Weakening before Manila . Hagupit should be even weaker by the time it passes near Manila on Monday evening. The biggest threat in the capital will come from the heavy rainfall. That likely will lead to flash flooding and mudslides, even in places far from the storm's center. Several airports were closed Sunday, leading to 185 domestic flight cancellations, Pama said. Once debris is cleared from some of those airports, the Philippine military will fly C-130 planes from Manila and Cebu to affected areas with necessary supplies, he added. Flooding, landslides, and fallen trees are hampering government efforts to drive relief essentials to affected areas. ""Our emphasis now is road-clearing operations,"" Pama said. ""Don't worry if you are thinking we're out of supply. It will come soon. There may be delay due to roads that are not passable,"" he said. Fishermen fears typhoon will 'destroy everything' Tacloban dodges bullet . One city farther south breathed a sigh of relief Sunday. In Tacloban, the streets were empty because residents had already evacuated. Last year, Super Typhoon Haiyan devastated Tacloban, killing more than 6,000 people and leaving 200,000 people homeless. Many people in Tacloban are still living in tents or other rudimentary structures more than a year after Haiyan. At least 100,000 people evacuated Tacloban before Typhoon Hagupit struck, the U.N. humanitarian agency OCHA Philippines said. That's half the population of the city. Mayor Alfred Romualdez told CNN the city is without power, but he's seen only minor damage such as broken windows and downed trees. Many roads were flooded, but not impassable. ""There was a lot of preparation,"" OCHA spokeswoman Orla Fagan said. ""I think that the lessons learned were very hard ones in Tacloban ... because there were so many lives lost, and I think they've really taken cognizance this time and really made an all-out effort everywhere to bring people to safety.""

"Rome (CNN)A row has erupted over allegations by representatives of Rome's Jewish community that they were locked into the former Nazi Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland and treated ""like real criminals"" after filming a TV interview. Rome's Jewish community spokesman Fabio Perugia said on Twitter that he and the head of Rome's Jewish community, Riccardo Pacifici, had been filming with a TV crew from Italy's Canale 5 following a ceremony Tuesday to mark 70 years since the camp's liberation. The crew had finished their work at 11 p.m., and the group tried to leave, he said. But group members found they were locked in the camp in subzero temperatures with no security guards in sight. ""Riccardo Pacifici then pushed through a window that was in the ticket sales building, and the window opened up,"" Perugia said. ""He entered and then opened the door for us. At that point, the alarm went off. And we thought, 'Good, finally someone from security will come to let us out.' "" However, at this point, their night got worse, Perugia said. ""The security guard arrived indeed, but instead of letting us go, they kept us there. For hours, and hours and hours. They started to interrogate us and they treated us like real criminals,"" he said. Perugia said the guards were inflexible and insisted on following procedure. Eventually, they took the party to the Auschwitz police station, he said, where they were kept until 5:30 a.m. and questioned one by one. ""They don't know how to distinguish between the real criminals and those who were there simply to do an interview and honor the Day of Memory,"" he said. The incident ended with the party writing down their version of events, Perugia said, adding that they had asked for the matter to be looked into through Italian diplomatic channels. A spokesman for the Auschwitz museum gave CNN a different account of the evening's events, however. Pawel Sawicki said the Italian TV crew had permission to film at the site until 11.30 p.m., when they had agreed that they would exit and security guards would come to the gate to let them out. He said CCTV footage shows they finished early and went to the gate a few minutes past 11 p.m. Rather than waiting for the security guards to come at the agreed time, one of them broke into the visitor center and let others in, too, he said. This triggered an alarm, so the security guards came to the building, which houses cash registers and an ATM. According to protocol, they asked the men to show ID, but they refused to do so, Sawicki said. The police had to be called since they can only demand that people show ID documents, he said. The police then arrived and took over the matter, he said. ""While being on the site, we have to follow the rules,"" Sawicki said. ""So until the unfortunate incident, everything was OK because they had our permission, they cooperated with our security and they had the time that they declared they would be leaving."" He said the group could also have gone to another exit 150 meters (nearly 500 feet) away where the security guards were based if they wanted to leave earlier -- and could then have been let out of that gate. ""However, they decided to act outside the regulations and triggered the security alarm and triggered the whole reaction and then refused to cooperate."" Auschwitz is a ""priceless heritage place,"" he said. ""It must be protected and there must be security."" CNN's Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported from London and Hada Messia from Rome.","Rome's Jewish community spokesman says they were treated like criminals at Auschwitz .

"Tensions in Ferguson, Missouri, have simmered since black teen Michael Brown was shot and killed by a white police officer in August. And with a grand jury expected to soon deliver its decision on whether to indict the officer, a group that represents protesters says it wants 48-hours notice before the decision is announced so it can help prevent the St. Louis suburb from once again boiling over with anger, violence and confusion. A group of community members calling themselves the Don't Shoot Coalition this week released 19 ""Rules of Engagement"" that touch on major points of contention between protesters and police since Brown's August 9 killing. Witnesses said Brown, who was unarmed, had his hands in the air as if surrendering, when he was shot. Authorities said Brown attacked the officer. Dueling narratives in Michael Brown shooting . 'Prepare for the worst' Ferguson Mayor James Knowles told local media this week that authorities must ""prepare for the worst"" and he expects demonstrations across the area. He and his administration didn't respond to CNN's inquiries about whether city officials would agree to the coalition's requests. Ferguson police also did not respond to CNN's questions about what that department thinks of the ""rules,"" but St. Louis County police said their department ""endorses the statement from the Don't Shoot Coalition regarding the sanctity and preservation of human life. To that end, and in the spirit of building communications, members of the Unified Command have met with the coalition to define common goals."" Many protesters were furious because they feel Brown's killing was an example of excessive use of force. They and heavily armed law enforcement clashed in the streets for days after Brown's death. Authorities, who drove armored vehicles and wore military gear, were roundly criticized by members of the media, other law enforcement officials and demonstrators for escalating the violence, rather than tempering it. Law enforcement also was accused of blocking and, in some cases, attacking journalists who were trying to report on the situation. FAA issues no-fly zone over Ferguson . 19 'Rules of Engagement' Some of the coalition's ""rules"" ask that police provide information that makes clear law enforcement's chain of command, who is making what decisions and why, and assurances that neither police nor the government will interfere with the flow of information. That means, according to the ""rules,"" there will be no unwarranted wiretapping or attempts to interfere with internet and cellular access. The rules ask the police not to use rubber bullets, armored vehicles, rifles and tear gas. The organization also has written stipulations about how it wants police to present themselves, including a request that officers wear attire ""minimally required for their safety"" and that ""specialized riot gear will be avoided except as a last resort."" Knowles would not give details on law enforcement's plan following the grand jury's decision, CNN affiliate Fox 2 reported Wednesday. But he spoke in broad terms about the approach law enforcement is going to take. ""It's not going to be about lining up a fixed line of law enforcement officers somewhere, it's going to be about being prepared, being reactive, being mobile, being able to respond to wherever an issue breaks out,"" the mayor said. Knowles also expects there's going to be unrest outside of Ferguson. ""It's not going to be about Ferguson,"" he said. ""The threats that are out there are threats across the region. Our expectation is that demonstrations will probably break out in several places."" The mayor told Fox 2 that people who are close to organizers and protesters have informed him that demonstrators are planning to focus on areas around St. Louis and the city's downtown. Area school superintendents have written a letter urging that when the grand jury comes to a decision that it be announced on a weekend or at least not on a weekday until after 5 p.m. The superintendents are concerned that if chaos happens, that could affect the ability of nearly 20,000 students who use transportation to get to and from school. If violence breaks out in Ferguson, people who live there won't be behind it, Knowles told Fox 2. ""I think you have to prepare for the worst, but I think we all hope the best out of people,"" Knowles said. ""I don't believe that there is even a small fraction of residents in the city of Ferguson who want to do any damage or harm to any other residents or to any businesses... the concern would be who comes (from) outside the area."" Opinion: Ferguson: The signal it sends about America . Are the 'rules' legal? Don't Shoot Coalition co-chair Michael McPherson said the purpose of the group's proposed rules is to ""de-escalate violence"" without tamping down on peaceful protest action. ""What we're trying to do is make sure that we move everything into a constructive way to create change,"" he said. CNN legal analyst Paul Callan and radio personality Mo Ivory, appearing on CNN on Thursday, praised the idea of community members working with law enforcement to avoid a repeat of the chaos that raged in August and September. ""It's been done in mass demonstrations in the past -- marches on Washington, D.C., for civil rights, protesting the Vietnam war,"" he said. Opinion: What does justice mean for Ferguson? Callan was skeptical that the police would -- or should -- agree to some of the rules, including those that govern what police can wear and when they can make arrests. One rule states: ""Police will be more tolerant of more minor lawbreaking such as thrown water bottles when deciding whether to escalate the use of force."" ""When you're out on the street and there's a huge street demonstration which could go violent immediately, you have to be prepared for that,"" Callan said. ""What are they going to do? Go change? If you're a cop you have to protect yourself from things being thrown at you."" In the days after Brown's shooting, Ivory noted that the police looked like ""they were going to war."" ""And that's what made the protesters feel that heightened (fear)... because of the way the police were speaking to them,"" she said. As far as being notified 48 hours ahead of a grand jury verdict, Callan said that was legal and could be done, though it would be an unusual step. ""I can't find any cases where the judiciary, which runs the grand jury, gave advance notice to street demonstrators about when an indictment was going to come down,"" Callan said. ""On the other hand, it's not illegal, so theoretically, it could be done."" Complete coverage on Ferguson .","Mayor James Knowles: ""Demonstrations will probably break out in several places""

"(CNN)When Ryan Ferguson and his dad travel this week to Glendale, Arizona, for the Super Bowl, it will be a bucket-list experience. And yet for them it will be so much more. For Ferguson, a Missouri native, it'll be a chance to thank his father, Bill -- the man who never stopped fighting for him while he spent 10 years behind bars for a crime he didn't commit. ""Being able to do this with my father after all he's done for me, sacrificing 10 years of his life to prove my innocence -- that's when it became real,"" said Ferguson. The father-son pilgrimage came about last month when a ticket distributor who had heard about his story offered Ferguson an all-expenses-paid trip to Sunday's game. The 30-year-old, who now lives in Florida, was released from prison in 2013. Ferguson's 12-year nightmare began on November 1, 2001. He and his friend Charles Erickson, both then 17, were drinking illegally at a college bar in Columbia, Missouri. About five blocks away, Columbia Tribune Sports Editor Kent Heitholt turned off his computer after a long night and left the newsroom shortly after 2 a.m., according to court documents. In the newspaper's parking lot, someone struck Heitholt from behind and strangled him with his own belt. Police interviewed a janitor, Jerry Trump, who said he couldn't identify the people involved in the slaying. But two years later, Erickson told police he had ""dream-like"" memories of committing the crime, according to court documents. Ferguson told police that he remembered driving Erickson home before going home himself. But after Erickson implicated him and Trump changed his account, Ferguson was charged with murder and convicted in 2004. When Ryan's father, Bill Ferguson, awoke the day after his son's arrest, he was devastated. ""'Oh my God, I got to get to work,' "" his father, now 70, recalls thinking. ""It's like watching one of your children drowning. I had to do something."" ""I started reading the police reports over and over,"" said the real estate agent. ""I made a timeline and flow chart of all the depositions. I started questioning people on my own, and I dug up a lot of witnesses."" Each week, Ferguson's father visited his son in the maximum-security prison where he was held. They would share updates, compare notes and work on the case together. Ferguson served a quarter of his 40-year sentence while his family and friends campaigned to free him. After two key witnesses admitted that they had lied, a court of appeals overturned his conviction in November 2013 and Ferguson walked free. Erickson is serving a 25-year sentence in a Missouri prison. No one else has ever been charged in the case. ""Can you imagine wiping out everything you did in your 20s?"" Ferguson said. ""That's what it (spending 10 years in prison) is like."" After he was freed, Ferguson did not feel safe in his hometown. The case had gotten a lot of attention locally, and a lot of people knew who he was. Ferguson said he feared the legal system which had put him, an innocent man, in prison. ""I love Columbia, Missouri,"" he told CNN. ""If it wasn't for the authorities, I'd go back."" While in prison, he worked out religiously and began writing his first book, about physical fitness. Upon getting out, he moved to Florida, became a certified personal trainer and earlier this month, published ""Stronger, Faster, Smarter: A Guide to Your Most Powerful Body."" ""The crazy thing is I saw him more when he was in prison,"" said his father, Bill Ferguson, who still lives in Missouri. ""He's been incredibly busy. We get together around once a month."" Football has always been a way to bring the father and son together. ""I played football in college and high school. He was brought up on it,"" Bill Ferguson said. ""It's a vernacular for us, a way for us to get together and have something to talk about."" For the elder Ferguson, the best part of the Super Bowl trip will be getting to spend a few days with his son. ""We'll get to watch one of the greatest sports possible, and we'll get to spend a lot of time, just the two of us, together,"" said his father. Ram Silverman, co-founder of Texas-based Golden Tickets, had watched CBS's ""48 Hours"" special about Ferguson a few years ago. In November, he saw a follow-up about Ferguson being released from prison and wanted to do something nice for him. ""Whatever cost we incur, it's worth it,"" Silverman said. ""He's got an amazing attitude. After talking to him a number of times, I can't wait to meet him."" It took Silverman about a month of trying to connect with Ryan Ferguson on Facebook and other channels before his offer was taken seriously. ""It seemed like one of those things that were too good to be true,"" said Ferguson. ""In my life, I've learned to leave things alone that are too good to be true."" CNN first learned of the news from freelance writer Paul Fitzgerald, who uploaded the story to CNN iReport. At first, Ferguson didn't have much of a reaction to the Super Bowl offer. ""The excitement, joy and happiness didn't hit until I talked to my dad,"" he said. ""We were screaming on the phone, 'Yeahhhhh!' "" While Ryan doesn't have a Super Bowl favorite -- he's just excited to see ""amazing people do amazing things"" -- his dad is rooting for the Seattle Seahawks in their matchup with the New England Patriots. ""When we were in Seattle, we were so impressed with their spirit,"" said Bill Ferguson, referring to a trip in 2014. ""It'd be difficult for us not to be supporters."" The father and son will spend a long weekend together, reveling in football fandom and their shared bond. And making up for lost time. ""Being locked up for 10 years meant no college and I never even sent a text or posted a Facebook update or used a smartphone,"" Ferguson told iReporter Paul Fitzgerald. ""I will get to go to the Super Bowl with my dad. It's a dream come true. This is a golden opportunity and one that I will never, ever forget for the rest of my life.""","Ryan Ferguson is taking his dad Bill on a bucket-list trip to the Super Bowl .

"(CNN) -- America had already telegraphed plans to attack terrorist targets in Syria, but the operation that unfolded over Syrian skies overnight brought several significant and revealing surprises. Here are five important ones: . 1. Arab countries joined in attacking ISIS. It was always crucial that Washington keep this fight against the so-called Islamic State from becoming another American war, and especially that it deny extremists the ability to portray it as a war against Muslims or against Arabs. This opening salvo in Syria is an important step in that direction. The U.S. reported that Bahrain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar -- all Sunni states -- ""participated in or supported"" strikes against ISIS, which is also Sunni and violently anti-Shiite. The ""supported"" part probably applies to Qatar, whose participation in any capacity is quite a surprise. Qatar has actively backed the opposition against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and many blame it for funneling the support that allowed Islamist groups to emerge as the dominant segment of the anti-al-Assad forces. 2. The United States didn't just hit ISIS, it targeted al Qaeda's Khorasan Group's ""imminent"" attack on America. This news bombshell was hidden in the Pentagon's press release, which said the U.S. ""took action to disrupt an imminent attack plotting against the United States and Western interests."" Until now, the debate over whether or not the United States should strike in Syria has referred specifically to the threat posed by ISIS, but outside the United States, there has been growing concern about the rise of Khorasan, a group made up of highly experienced al Qaeda fighters. U.S. Central Command said American forces -- without Arab participation -- struck explosives and munitions depots, training camps and other Khorasan facilities. By attacking al Qaeda, the United States is helping prevent another militant group from filling the vacuum when and if ISIS loses strength in Syria. Defanging Khorasan would make it possible for moderate Syrian rebels -- rather that al-Assad regime forces or other extremists --- to move in where ISIS falls back. 3. The rise of ISIS has triggered jihadi competition to strike the United States. The emergence of Khorasan as a major player in Syria points to the intensity of rivalry between jihadi groups in Syria. That is good news in the sense that ISIS and al Qaeda have more enemies, but it is extremely dangerous because jihadi groups are likely to try to upstage one another by hitting American and Western targets. The Khorasan Group is headed by Muhsin al Fadhli, a 33-year-old Kuwaiti who has topped most-wanted lists in many countries. He reportedly played a major role in the acrimonious breakup in Syria between ISIS and al Qaeda. Al Fadhli and ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi operate from a personal enmity. As al-Baghdadi seeks to topple al Qaeda as the leader of global jihad, it is reasonable to expect that the two organizations will compete for adherents and prestige by seeking to attack Americans and Europeans. 4. Al-Assad didn't respond, but a Syrian fighter jet crossed into Israel and was shot down. The most daunting aspect of the fight against Islamist extremists in Syria is that they seek to topple al-Assad. Meanwhile, America's position remains that al-Assad should leave power. The enemy of their enemy is no friend of the United States. Washington maintains that it did not seek permission from al-Assad to strike inside his country and there was ""no coordination or cooperation"" with either Syria or its ally, Iran. Syria's foreign ministry says the United States informed its U.N. envoy before striking on its territory. Damascus did not lift a finger to object to the violation of its airspace by a hostile military coalition. There was, however, another incident. Israel says that early Tuesday a Syrian fighter jet infiltrated Israeli airspace and was shot down. The pilots ejected safely into Syria space. Israel says the plane flew half a mile into its territory and says it has no intention of becoming involved in the war in Syria. It was the first time in more than two decades that Israel has intercepted a Syrian military plane, and a retired Israeli general told The New York Times he thought the incursion was not deliberate. Whatever triggered the incident, it is further evidence of just how dangerous the Syrian conflict is, and how easily it could continue to expand into new territories. 5. America's timing is smart, strategic and a little embarrassing. The timing of America's first direct hit inside Syria comes almost exactly a year after President Barack Obama announced he would strike against al-Assad's forces because they had crossed his ""red line"" by using chemical weapons. That did not happen. Now Obama is hitting al-Assad's enemies. The irony is more than a little awkward, but the timing could prove politically productive. The attacks came just hours before Obama's scheduled speech to the U.N. General Assembly, an annual gathering that not only provides an important platform to address the international community but also offers almost unlimited possibilities for face-to-face meetings with world leaders. The United States is in the middle of a major diplomatic push to build up support against ISIS. At the United Nations, Obama will make the case for the rightness of the cause against the murderous extremists seeking to terrorize the Middle East and the world. He also needs to invigorate the push for a less sectarian government in Iraq, so that the country's Shiites and Sunnis will join in the life-and-death struggle against ISIS. He will seek to enlist new allies in the fight and bring old ones -- notably Turkey -- into line. After years of resisting intervention in Syria, after more than 200,000 people have died, millions have been displaced there, and after the Syria civil war has metastasized and spread, fracturing Iraq and sending millions of refugees into Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and elsewhere, the United States finally decided to act. That it eventually would have no choice but to do so is hardly unexpected. But there are sure to be many more surprises in the months to come. There is ample irony in the timing and the occasion -- the highest-profile meeting of the world's foremost peace organization -- but there is also news that the people in ISIS-controlled parts of Syria are quietly celebrating America's newfound resolve.","Frida Ghitis: The attack of U.S. and allies on ISIS targets in Syria offered several surprises .

"(CNN)January 26, 2015 . I've been here 10 days now, and spent last weekend on call at ELWA Hospital, the 55-bed facility that SIM runs just outside Monrovia, Liberia's capital city. The news here is good -- the Ebola epidemic really seems to be coming to an end. But in the health care setting in particular, its effects will be felt for many months to come. Many outward changes have been made at ELWA due to the Ebola crisis. All patients, staff and visitors now enter the hospital compound through a single gate where people must wash their hands with bleach and have their temperatures checked before entry. Bleach is everywhere throughout the hospital. Staff members with sprayers wash down the floors multiple times per day. They are on hand after surgeries or other exposures to blood or body fluids to decontaminate staff before they take off their gowns and gloves. Temporary buildings have been erected to house our outpatient clinic, because our old clinic became part of the Ebola Treatment Unit, ELWA-2. But for the most part, ELWA Hospital is up and running, and most beds are full. For me personally, the first week was about confronting the reality of death. Many patients die in the hospital -- this should not be a surprise, right? But emotionally it is a challenge to face mortality so frequently. We counseled several patients about their metastatic cancer this week, presenting them with the hard information that the cancer had progressed beyond a stage where anything could be done from the medical point of view. We talk with these patients privately, off the busy ward; then, along with the hospital's chaplain, we pray for them if they wish. The comfort and compassion we offer, along with an honest explanation in plain language, are important hallmarks of the work we do. Friday, we had a 5-month-old infant arrive from Buchanan, about a three-hour drive down the coast, in very critical condition with pneumonia, sepsis and a distended abdomen. Very few hospitals have opened, so ELWA was the closest one the family could get to. Sadly, she died about 30 minutes after arriving. Although we doubted this child had Ebola, we wore protective gear as we tried to revive her and then performed an Ebola test to be sure, which turned out to be negative. Thinking about the possibility of Ebola is going to be with us for a long time, maybe forever. Later, we received a woman in her 40s who had been sick for about six months. She had lost weight and was so weak she was unable to walk. Examination revealed a mass that seemed most consistent with ovarian cancer. She died during the night.  We might not have been able to help her if she had come to a hospital sooner, because of the type of cancer she had, but if she had known her condition, her end of life journey might have been different. We mourn with these families and others who are losing their loved ones not to Ebola virus, but certainly to the greater impact the epidemic has had on the health care system. The bright spot for the weekend was doing two cesarean sections on Sunday with Rebecca, a Canadian doctor in her first year out of residency. The first was a patient with a transverse lie (the baby lying sideways in the womb); the second a woman who had a big baby and not enough space to deliver. Both of these babies came out alive and responded to some basic resuscitation, with crying and healthy color. That was a relief, and was unlike August, when delays in getting to the hospital caused most of our deliveries and C-sections to be stillbirths. Finally, in the middle of the night I was called to go to the hospital to evaluate a woman who had delivered an hour and a half before. She had suddenly become dizzy and weak and then gone into shock. By the time I got there, despite IV fluids and oxygen, we had lost her. This was an unusual case -- one minute she was sitting up playing with her new baby and talking with the staff, and just a few minutes later she was gasping. She most likely had an amniotic fluid embolism, in which amniotic fluid entered her bloodstream and got into her lungs, a rare and catastrophic event which, even in the developed world, has an 85% mortality rate as patients quickly go into shock. All through Monday, my heart was heavy from the losses of the weekend. I think my co-workers felt the same way. But as we sang hymns and prayed during morning devotions on Tuesday, we experienced a sense of unity and a release of our sadness. During the song ""I Surrender All,"" the person leading devotions encouraged us to take the challenges we faced and the feelings that overwhelmed us and surrender them to Jesus, who loves us and shares our grief as we do this work in His name. It was just a relief to lay it all down at the feet of Jesus, restoring my spirit to be ready to care for the next patient who needs our compassion and concern.","Dr. Rick Sacra survived Ebola and is back in Africa, caring for patients .

"(CNN)A fossilized human jawbone discovered by a Taiwanese fisherman, sold to an antique shop, then recovered by researchers may reveal a new kind of prehistoric man. The unlikely find could be nearly 200,000 years old and suggests a fourth type of ancient human who lived in Asia long before Homo sapiens ever came to be. Three other known archaic Asian hominids include Homo erectus, found in Java and China; the shorter Homo floresiensis from Indonesia; and Neanderthals in the Russian Altai mountains. Scientists believe that human jaws and teeth became smaller as they evolved. But unlike other fossils of the time, the newly discovered jawbone is thick with large molars, suggesting the existence of a different group. ""The new Taiwan mandible is clearly different than the known Homo erectus populations from northern China and Java, and likely represents a group that has been unrecognized so far,"" researcher Dr. Yousuke Kaifu told CNN. ""It's only one piece, but the significance is huge."" Researchers from Taiwan and Japan named the ancient human ""Penghu 1,"" after the Penghu Channel where the fossil was found. The team spent five years analyzing the bone, which was difficult to date because it had been recovered from the sea. ""The findings reminded me that our knowledge is always very limited, and we have very limited fossil records,"" said Kaifu. ""That's a great lesson for me.""

"Refusing to buckle to violent protests demanding more action, Turkey's foreign minister insisted Thursday his nation ""is on Kobani's side"" -- referring to the Syrian border town in imminent danger of falling to ISIS -- but still won't unilaterally send ground troops to save it. Time may be running out. Smoke rose over Kobani, a Kurdish enclave in Syria that's a stone's throw from the Turkish border, as U.S. warplanes pounded ISIS targets from above while Kurdish fighters tried to fend off the Islamist extremist group from below. But ISIS isn't backing down. It seems to have wrested control of one-third of Kobani, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group. Speaking alongside visiting NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu stressed his country vehemently opposed ISIS and its actions in Kobani and elsewhere. Like it or not, Turkey is already knee deep in the regional unrest, having taken in more than 1.5 million people from Syria and Iraq, including some 200,000 Syrians from the Kobani region in the past two weeks. Cavusoglu said Turkey supports the U.S.-led airstrikes against ISIS, though he stated these can only be so effective. ""Maybe you can stop them for a short period but you cannot clean the whole region from ISIS or some other terrorist organizations,"" the foreign minister said. ""You need to take into consideration all options, including an operation on the ground."" The group that could help beat ISIS . That's what protesters around Turkey and outside of it have demanded, warning innocent people will be killed in mass -- much like what ISIS has been accused of in many other communities around Syria and Iraq, since it stepped up its armed campaign to take over territory amid Syria's yearslong civil war -- if something drastic isn't done. There are ongoing talks about what the international approach to the crisis could look like. ""Once there is a (common) decision, Turkey will not be reluctant to do its part,"" Cavusoglu said. ""It is not realistic to expect Turkey to conduct a ground operation on its own,"" Cavusoglu said. Who's doing what in the coalition battle . Erdogan lashes out against protests calling for action . This position won't satisfy those who have hit the streets around Turkey in recent days. They've chanted, marched and clashed with authorities using tear gas and other means. ""We want more airstrikes, we want a clear message,"" said Rebar Hajo, a Syrian Kurdish politician. ""... The massacre is about to happen, and we have to act very ... promptly and intensify our attacks on them."" According to Anadolu, the nation's semiofficial news agency, 30 people have been killed since Wednesday across eight locations during what it calls the ""illegal protests."" This figure does not include six killed Thursday in Bingol, including two police officers shot while ""doing damage assessment from the protests."" Dozens more have been injured in the protests nationwide, including at least three police officers in Istanbul alone. Agriculture Minister Mehdi Eker said 116 people had been arrested in connection with the violence and another 294 face charges for curfew violations. President Recep Erdogan criticized the demonstrations, claiming they were tied to connected to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party and aimed to ""manipulate perceptions of Turkey's policies,"" according to another Anadolu story. In a statement, he vowed that Turkish authorities will go after those behind ""these acts of violence, vandalism and looting."" Turkey's tough choice: Take on ISIS or the PKK? ""Turkey will never tolerate any traps against our peace, stability or sense of brotherhood,"" Erdogan said. At the same time, the Turkish government says it stands with Kurds on both sides of the Syrian border unnerved by ISIS' advance. Cavusoglu rejected the suggestion that Turkey had hung back, saying it has ""never acted reluctantly on this issue. "" He also denied ""discrimination on a sectarian basis"" -- i.e., not choosing to act because Kurds were the primary victims in Kobani -- was in play in Turkey's decisions. Last week, Parliament passed a resolution last week authorizing action against the terrorist group. The main opposition party, the Republican People's Party, said it will back this motion to authorize the army's ground operations as long as it is limited to rescuing Kobani and repelling ISIS. Witnesses: ISIS' gets reinforced, situation 'very bad' If ISIS manages to take Kobani, it will control a complete swath of land between its self-declared capital of Raqqa, Syria, and Turkey -- a stretch of more than 100 kilometers (62 miles). The United States wants Turkey to do more, U.S. administration officials said, and is urging Turkey to at least fire artillery at ISIS targets across the border. Witnesses inside Kobani told CNN that airstrikes Wednesday had been welcome but that the situation worsened Thursday. One fighter said that the situation was ""very bad"" and that ISIS had received reinforcements, in the form of a ""large"" number of fighters and vehicles, overnight. The fighter said ISIS troops have re-entered the eastern side of the city and called for the U.S.-led coalition to launch airstrikes there, where the onslaught is greatest. He said there had been only two strikes Thursday morning. A media activist also in the town described intense street-to-street fighting around the Kurdish security forces' headquarters, near the center of Kobani, as well as in the south of the town. He also called for more airstrikes against ISIS, saying the two so far Thursday were not enough. The U.S. military announced Thursday that it had launched six airstrikes south of Kobani, destroying two buildings, one tank, one heavy machine gun, as well as hitting one large and two small groups of ISIS fighters. Another three airstrikes north of Kobani hit two small ISIS groups and destroyed two buildings. This was on top of other coalition efforts to go after the Islamist extremist group, including a pair of U.S. airstrikes near Sinjar in Iraq.

"A British investment banker has been charged with murder in Hong Kong over the killings of two young Indonesian women at a high-rise apartment in the heart of the densely populated city. One of the victims was discovered stuffed inside a suitcase on the balcony of the 31st-floor apartment. The other was found lying inside with cuts on her body. The suspect, a 29-year-old man named Rurik Jutting, appeared before a magistrates' court in Hong Kong on Monday on two charges of murder. Wearing black-rimmed glasses, a black T-shirt, and dark jeans, Jutting was not handcuffed. He responded ""I do"" when asked by the court clerk if he understood the charges against him but didn't enter a plea. Police called in early hours . Police said they were called to the upmarket apartment in the popular nightlife district of Wan Chai early Saturday morning by Jutting, a former Bank of America employee. They first discovered a woman lying inside the one-bedroom residence, identified by local media as a disc jockey at a neighborhood pub. The woman, 29, had cuts on her neck and buttock, according to a police statement. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Court documents said the woman, later identified as Seneng Mujiasih, had been killed Saturday. Officers later discovered the body of another woman, with wounds on her neck, inside a suitcase on the apartment's balcony. Victims said to be killed days apart . The second victim was identified as Sumarti Ningsih, according to court documents, which said she had been killed on October 27, five days before her body was found. Both women were Indonesian citizens, said Pangky Saputra, vice consul at the Indonesian Consulate in Hong Kong. Sumarti was a 25-year-old who entered Hong Kong last month on a tourist visa, according to a report in the South China Morning Post. When they arrived at the apartment, police discovered a grisly scene, with the residence covered in blood, the newspaper reported. The throat of the unidentified victim had been slashed, it said. Police said they arrested the suspect after finding a knife at the scene.  Autopsies will be performed on the victims to determine the cause of death, authorities said. Career in investment banking . Court documents gave his occupation as a ""banker"" for Bank of America in Hong Kong. Paul Scanlon, a spokesman for Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong, said that a person named Rurik Jutting had worked there but left the bank recently. He declined to comment further on the case. The social network LinkedIn lists a profile for Jutting that says he had worked in structured equity finance and trading for the bank in Hong Kong since July 2013. Before that, he worked in the same division in London for three years. According to the profile, he previously worked in capital markets for the British bank Barclays from 2008 to 2010 and studied history and law at the prestigious University of Cambridge between 2004 and 2008. The British Foreign Office confirmed Sunday that a British citizen was arrested in Hong Kong on suspicion of murder, but did not release the name, citing regulations. Luxurious apartment building . Jutting didn't apply for bail on Monday. He will remain in jail until his next court appearance on November 10. J Residence, the upscale apartment building where the bodies were found, is described by real estate websites as popular with expatriates for its luxurious facilities, including a heated rooftop swimming pool. The site squarefoot.com lists similar apartments to the one Jutting was staying in as available at monthly rents of 21,000 Hong Kong dollars to 29,000 Hong Kong dollars ($2,700 to $3,700). The Wan Chai district, a commercial and residential area on Hong Kong Island, is known for its high number of restaurants, bars and nightclubs -- as well as its long-established red-light district. The case has shocked many residents of Hong Kong, which is often described as one of the safest big cities in the world. Reports of the deaths stirred memories of the case of Nancy Kissel, an American woman who was convicted of the 2003 killing of her banker husband, whose body was found in the storeroom of the couple's luxury apartment four days after his death.","The suspect, Rurik Jutting, appears before a Hong Kong court but doesn't enter a plea .

"Even after apologizing for his department's actions following Michael Brown's shooting, the police chief of Ferguson, Missouri, insisted Thursday that he's not going anywhere -- telling CNN, ""this is mine, and I'm taking ownership of it."" Police Chief Thomas Jackson acknowledged that he's heard calls for his ouster, but that doesn't mean he'll answer them. ""I've talked to a lot of people who have initially called for that and then changed their mind after having meetings and discussions about moving forward,"" Jackson said. ""Realistically, I'm going to stay here and see this through."" By 'this,"" he means taking a leadership role in a police department and a community that is still marred by discord and distrust of authorities -- especially among those in its large African-American community -- since the August 9 shooting. Brown was a 18-year-old black teenager killed by Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson, who is white. Despite demands by protesters, Wilson has not been charged in this case, though a grand jury is hearing evidence that could lead to an indictment. The shooting also stirred complaints of widespread racial profiling in Ferguson, which Jackson rejected Thursday. ""It's never been the intention of the Ferguson police department -- or any police department that I know -- to intentionally target individuals because of race,"" said the chief. ""If there is that happening, it's a crime and it needs to be addressed."" Chief 'sorry' Brown's body wasn't removed sooner . Jackson's interview with CNN came Thursday afternoon, shortly after the release of his video apology to Brown's parents and the peaceful demonstrators who took to Ferguson's streets to protest Brown's death. In that video, the chief expressed regret that it took investigating officers four hours to remove Brown's body from the street after he was shot dead. ""I'm truly sorry for the loss of your son. I'm also sorry that it took so long to remove Michael from the street,"" he said during his video statement. Investigators were doing ""important work"" trying to uncover the truth and collect evidence during those four hours, Jackson said, but ""it was just too long, and I'm truly sorry for that."" ""Please know that the investigating officers meant no disrespect to the Brown family, to the African-American community or the people (in the neighborhood where Brown was shot). They were simply trying to do their jobs,"" Jackson said. Asked Thursday afternoon why the apology took so long, Jackson told CNN, ""There's been so much going on, and every day there's a different challenge."" He said he's been wanting to apologize for ""the time it took to remove Michael from the scene,"" and he feels better now that he's done it. ""This is something that's just been weighing on me. It's something that needed to be said. It should've been said a long time ago,"" he told CNN. Feels 'responsible' if peaceful protesters were 'upset' Dressed casually in a red polo shirt, Jackson acknowledged in his video apology that most protesters who took to the streets of Ferguson following the shooting did so peacefully, even if there were others among them ""who had a different agenda."" Jackson singled out the peaceful protesters in his video. ""The right of the people to peacefully assemble is what the police are here to protect. If anyone who was peacefully exercising that right is upset and angry, I feel responsible and I'm sorry,"" he said. He also acknowledged that the incident has sparked a larger conversation about societal issues, and he expressed interest in being part of the discussion. ""Overnight I went from being a small-town police chief to being part of a conversation about racism, equality and the role of policing in that conversation. As chief of police, I want to be part of that conversation. I also want to be part of the solution,"" he said. He emphasized that ""the city belongs to all of us"" and conceded that Ferguson and the surrounding areas have ""much work to do."" ""For any mistakes I've made, I take full responsibility. It's an honor to serve the city of Ferguson and the people who live there. I look forward to working with you in the future to solve our problems, and once again, I deeply apologize to the Brown family,"" he said. Afterward, some Ferguson residents who'd criticized police and backed the Browns expressed satisfaction with the apology, saying it needed to be said. Others described it as too little too late, or at least called it useless unless Jackson's words are backed up by actions to change things in Ferguson. Fresh violence on the streets . The St. Louis suburb was cast into the national spotlight when protests erupted following Wilson's shooting of the 18-year-old Brown. The demonstrations quickly devolved into looting, vandalism and violence but eventually calmed. The St. Louis suburb of 21,000 erupted again this week after one of three Brown memorials at the site of the shooting burned. While many peaceful protesters took to the street Tuesday night, violent elements within the demonstration stoked chaos, attacking police with guns, rocks and bottles and vandalizing and looting businesses, Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said. One person threw a Molotov cocktail at a parking structure, and there was an attempt to set a gasoline fire at a custard shop, he said. Two officers were injured, one of whom was struck by a rock below the eye, Johnson said. While Johnson promised police would protect public safety as well as the freedoms of speech and expression, he warned that police would have no choice but to respond to any violent actions. ""If that means officers will respond in riot gear, they will,"" he said Wednesday. ""We cannot have nights like last night. We can't have actions like last night that can result in injury or death. Those will not be tolerated."" In recent days, the City Council has taken up measures to reform court procedures and the way the city handles certain fines. The City Council is also presently considering a citizen review board that would work with the police department.

"(CNN) -- I know from experience how the lack of tangible evidence gnaws at an accident investigator. Eventually, the passion driving efforts to find answers is replaced with a feeling of futility and hopelessness. For the investigator in charge, valuable time that could be spent on the search and investigation will be spent justifying the cost of the search to the bureaucracy. But as the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 resumes after a four-month hiatus, investigators must realize the question here is not how much it will cost to find the airplane and determine the cause to ensure it won't happen again. Instead, the question should be this: How much will it cost if they don't? Armed with new maps of the seafloor from an extensive survey operation funded by the Australian Transportation Safety Board, the Fugro Equator has resumed the underwater search for MH370. Three ships will begin searching for debris on the ocean floor in a refined search area after new information revealing an attempt to communicate with the plane via satellite phone prompted investigators to revise the search area much farther south than previously. Each of the search vessels has been fitted with sophisticated underwater sonar equipment designed to use a towed device to examine the bottom of the ocean floor for abnormalities that may be remnants of the Boeing 777 that vanished from radar on March 8. The Echo Surveyor II being used is much more capable, and can work at more extreme depths, than the Bluefin 21 used in previous searches. But all this sophisticated equipment and trained scientists to operate it is not cheap. Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss announced a $50 million (Australian dollars) contract in August to fund yet another round of searches for the missing plane and 239 passengers and crew, while Australian Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston reportedly estimated as much as $25 million has been paid to the defense force for the visual search it conducted. In addition, another $60 million has been committed for the underwater search. Finally, if and when the aircraft is found, the retrieval and causal investigation could easily add $50 million or more to the price tag. All this adds up to what would be the costliest search in history, more even than the estimated $160 million in recovery costs for Air France Flight 447 off the coast of Brazil in 2009. The search area for that plane was narrowed to only five square miles within weeks, and yet it took nearly two years to find and recover the remnants of the Airbus A330 aircraft. The search and recovery area for MH370 is exponentially greater, at some 23,000 square miles, and may therefore be exponentially more expensive. But while it is understandable against the backdrop of such rising costs why investigators might be tempted to abandon the search, the consequences of not establishing the cause of the tragedy could be disastrous. After all, without some kind of assurance that the problem has been corrected -- clearly not possible without knowing what happened -- it could happen again at any time to any airline. The reality is that accidents without answers produce doubts about safety, and such doubt can eventually take a toll on the entire airline industry, not just one particular air carrier. True, millions of people continue to fly in the wake of the disappearance of MH370. But tens of millions of dollars in passenger revenue have already been lost as Malaysian Airline's jets reportedly fly with large numbers of vacant seats. As a result of the drop in passenger numbers, Malaysia Airlines is set to be removed from the stock exchange as part of a 12-point recovery plan in an effort to rebound from the losses. But imagine the damage it could do to the entire airline industry if there is another tragedy and still no answer to the question of what caused the disappearance of MH370. Such a turn of events would rock not only passengers' faith in the airlines' ability to keep them safe, but also governments' ability to assure safe air travel. Ultimately, while the cost of the search can be counted, the costs of giving up cannot be fully calculated. But they are surely higher, in terms of lost revenues and damaged public confidence. Put bluntly, the best way of ensuring that the tragedy of MH370 is not repeated is to find the plane -- or what remains of it -- and work out what actually caused this in the first place. Whatever the cost.","Search has resumed for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 .

"Starkville, Mississippi (CNN)Mitt Romney argued on Wednesday that Republicans need to spend more time targeting nontraditional GOP voters during presidential primaries, saying the party's messaging gap is greatest with minority voters. ""During our campaigns for the primary vote, we tend to go to the audiences that vote in a Republican primary and tend therefore not to be as involved in minority communities as we need to be to win the general election,"" the 2012 Republican presidential nominee told an audience at Mississippi State University. ""And so we got to stop thinking so much about the primary and start thinking more about making sure we have people that support us in the general election,"" he continued. He followed up saying he wasn't urging Republicans to spend less time thinking about the primary but to devote equal amount of attention to ""all audiences."" Romney, who's considering yet another presidential bid, made no mention of where he is in his thought process about a third campaign, but said he felt confident that ""the great days of America have not ended; they're ahead with the right kind of leadership."" Combating poverty . In his speech, Romney hit on familiar refrains about nostalgia from his campaign as well as challenges facing the country. He also wove in swipes against Clinton, who's widely considered the Democratic frontrunner if she runs for president. If Romney runs again, he's likely to make anti-poverty policy a key part of his message. Romney said the war on poverty that started under President Lyndon B. Johnson ""came from a good heart"" but argued ""the policies weren't as good as the heart."" To address the problem, Romney argued that the government should not create incentives for people to avoid marriage, saying a single mother on Medicaid or other assistance may not want to get married because she could lose her benefits. ""If marriage ... is essential to helping people to stay out of poverty, then we want to do the opposite,"" he said. ""We want to create incentives for them to get married, not to not get married."" He also said K-12 education needs to improve, and he encouraged creating incentives for people to hire workers who haven't worked before, but didn't outline specifics. Blasting Clinton . Romney is also looking straight past his potential GOP rivals and sharpening his attacks against Hillary Clinton. He argued that the former secretary of state was ""clueless"" on relations with Russia and would prove inept on economic policy if elected president. ""How can Secretary Clinton provide opportunity for all if she doesn't know where jobs come from in the first place?"" Romney said. He also argued that Clinton helped contribute to Obama's ""timid"" approach to foreign policy. ""Secretary of State Hillary Clinton cluelessly pressed a reset button for Russia, which smiled and then invaded Ukraine, a sovereign nation,"" Romney said. RELATED: Hillary Clinton stands by 'Russian reset' in face of recent events . As Romney was headed to Mississippi, the nation's poorest state, his political team fought back against perceptions that his wealth could be a political liability if he runs for president again, arguing that Clinton is no model for modest living, either. ""It's going to be hard for Hillary Clinton to make Mitt Romney's wealth a fruitful line of attack, with her multi-million dollar mansions in Georgetown and Chappaqua and her jet-setting lifestyle of the rich and famous,"" a Romney aide said Wednesday. That comment was also included in a new report by the Boston Globe that details how Romney purchased or built two new homes after his 2012 election loss. The former private equity CEO, whose wealth became an overriding theme for Democratic attacks, has a total of four homes: a mansion in La Jolla, California; a ski chalet in Park City, Utah; a large home in Salt Lake City; and a house on Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire. The home in La Jolla, complete with a car elevator, has been undergoing renovations to make it bigger since 2012, and according the Globe, is now being shown to potential buys by a broker. Correct the Record, the pro-Clinton communications and research PAC, pushed back against Romney's response Wednesday. ""While Mitt Romney tries in vain to reinvent himself as a friend to those who are struggling, Hillary Clinton is continuing her life-long work to lift up the middle class and level the playing field for all Americans,"" said Adrienne Elrod, communications director for the group, said in an email to CNN. RELATED: Jeb Bush's invisible man strategy . Romney was constantly playing defense against multi-million dollar Democratic campaigns that pilloried his corporate background and painted him as out of touch.

A spokesman for Clinton did not immediately return a request for comment. The former secretary of state, widely seen as the Democratic frontrunner if she runs for president, has fought her own battle against accusations of being out of touch, in part because of her six-figure speaking fees and because of comments she made last summer in which she argued that her family was ""dead broke"" after leaving the White House.

"Protesters have occupied major districts in Hong Kong to demand full universal suffrage for the city, a culmination of decades of frustration among the city's democracy activists. But as protests in this city enter a stubborn eighth week, there hasn't been any real breakthrough. Protesters continue to stake their ground while the Hong Kong police attempt to clear areas of the occupied sites. Student leaders and government officials have conducted one round of talks with little result, and no new talks are planned. Here's our guide to understanding the different players, what they want, and why there's no easy solution. The protest leaders . Who's calling the shots? The real answer is no one. Last year, law professor Benny Tai came up with the idea to ""occupy"" Hong Kong's downtown Central district if the government didn't give Hong Kongers full universal suffrage. His Gandhi-inspired group is called ""Occupy Central with Love and Peace."" But Occupy Central didn't kick off the current protests. Things blew up in late September after three pro-democracy student leaders were briefly arrested at the end of a class boycott, and their supporters tear gassed. That's when tens of thousands of protesters spontaneously came out to occupy Hong Kong's streets, leading to the situation we have now. The most famous student leader is a skinny 17-year-old named Joshua Wong  -- he leads a group of high school firebrands called Scholarism, and enjoys popular support among protesters. Also arrested were Alex Chow and Lester Shum from the Hong Kong Federation of Students (HKFS), representing university students. Chow and Shum are asking protesters to continue occupying the streets until the government offers a meaningful promise of electoral reform. On November 15, Chow and two other members of HKFS attempted to fly to Beijing to deliver protesters' demands to Chinese leaders, but were prevented from boarding an airplane after their travel permits were declared invalid. The students have one main demand: to bring ""real universal suffrage and real democracy"" to the city. The encampments . The occupied sites are fragile but sophisticated self-governed communities. While Tai may have come up with the idea to ""occupy"" and student leaders incited the protest, citizen protesters have now taken ownership of the movement, which they view as organic and leaderless. The number of protesters at the main camp varies, but when crowds are large it can feel like a cross between a summer music festival and a post-apocalyptic settlement. The site sprawls across an eight-lane highway in Hong Kong's Admiralty district, spilling out into side streets fortified by makeshift barricades. A well-oiled volunteer system manages supplies, recycling and first-aid. Each night, protesters sleep in colorful tents on the pavement. Three miles north, protesters have occupied some of the busiest streets in Mong Kok, a gritty, working-class shopping district famous for its thumping nightlife and triad ties. The atmosphere here is more riotous. In early October, the encampment was attacked by crowds of older men who tore down tents, attacked students, and allegedly sexually assaulted women in broad daylight. Outraged supporters have rallied to the camp's defense, while police have struggled -- and often failed -- to keep the peace. In mid-October, the Mong Kok camp was cleared by around 500-600 police in a dawn raid. However, protesters returned in huge numbers the next day and reoccupied the streets after a series of tense clashes with police. No major police action has been attempted since, and protesters show no signs they're willing to leave. There is a third, smaller encampment in Causeway Bay, Hong Kong's shopping district, which stretches across one lane of a busy road. Hong Kong's leader . C.Y. Leung, Hong Kong's chief executive, is hated with a passion by the city's pro-democracy citizens, who view him as an sly, imperious puppet of the Chinese Communist Party. And that's putting it politely. His resignation has been a key demand of protesters since they took to the streets a week ago. Leung has repeatedly said he won't step down. Instead, he has repeatedly asked protesters to disperse, while directing his deputy Carrie Lam to attempt negotiations with student leaders. In late October, Lam and four officials met with student leaders from HKFS for a round of televised talks. However, no agreement was reached after the talks, and no new talks are planned. It's doubtful whether Leung's administration can make any real concessions to protesters. The Hong Kong government's hands are largely tied by Beijing, which has firmly stated it will not allow Hong Kong to have the kind of democracy protesters are calling for. Anti-Occupy Hong Kongers . Many Hong Kongers oppose the Occupy protests, and for many different reasons. Some see the protesters as chasing a pipe dream, others say it's a mistake to upset Beijing. Older generations are especially wary of civil unrest, having fled Communist China, lived through Hong Kong's leftist riots in 1967 and witnessed the Tiananmen square crackdown on pro-democracy protesters on their television screens in 1989. What they all share is a deep disdain for the way today's protests are affecting the lives of ordinary citizens. With roads blocked, traffic has been snarled, commutes have been disrupted. In Mong Kok, some business owners have reported a dramatic decline in sales. A number of anti-Occupy voices have formed groups. Former journalist Robert Chow calls his group the ""Silent Majority for Hong Kong,"" and says the protesters are ""holding Hong Kong hostage."" The police . The police's goal is to return the city to normal, but they miscalculated by using tear gas on student protesters on September 28. Instead of dispersing the movement, it sparked outrage and caused thousands more protesters to hit the streets. Since then, police, hesitant to inflame tensions, have adopted a largely hands-off approach to the protest sites. In mid-October, police briefly cleared the Mong Kok protest site, only for thousands of protesters to reoccupy the site the next day. Relations between police and protesters also deteriorated when a video showed several plainclothes police officers beating and kicking a detained pro-democracy demonstrator in October. Triads . Multiple people with triad backgrounds have been arrested in Mong Kok after starting fights and igniting anger between Occupy and anti-Occupy protesters. Hong Kong's triads are known for controlling smuggling, prostitution and illegal gambling rings. Some of their businesses in Mong Kok -- Hong Kong's red light district -- have suffered as a result of the Occupy protests. While pro-democracy legislators and protest leaders have accused the government of sending triad members to disperse the protests, it's unclear who may have sent the triads or whether they came on their own accord. Beijing . China's president, Xi Jinping, dreads dissent and separatism. As China's economy continues to grow, he has been eager to project an image of national unity and strength to the world. At the APEC summit in November, Xi called the protests an ""illegal movement"" and declared his support for the Hong Kong government's handling of the situation. Beijing has also expressed its views through its state-run media, condemning the protests as ""illegal acts"" that ""are doomed to fail."" Chinese newspapers have dismissed the movement's potential to spread to the mainland as ""no more than a daydream."" Other news articles, social media posts, and images of Hong Kong's protests have been heavily censored in China: as the first images of the occupation went viral, even Instagram became inaccessible. The memory of China's 1989 Tiananmen square crackdown on pro-democracy protesters has loomed over Hong Kong and Beijing from the start. More than once, protesters have wondered whether Beijing will activate the 6,000 People's Liberation Army troops believed to be stationed in Hong Kong -- but so far, there's been no sign that will happen. It's obvious China is displeased. What's less certain is how serious of a threat they consider the protests to be.","Protesters are occupying parts of Hong Kong for an eighth week .

"Cairo (CNN)ISIS has a new residency in Egypt, according to a YouTube message posted Sunday. In the audio message, the Sinai-based militant group Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, or ABM, allegedly announces its allegiance to ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State. The roughly 10-minute clip blames tyrants and their ""Jewish agents and their allies"" for decades of Muslim suffering. The message also calls ISIS ""the emergence of a new dawn."" If verified, this would be a new, dangerous chapter for the deadliest group in Egypt. Since 2012, ABM's attacks have grown more daring and sophisticated. The group has killed hundreds of Egyptian police officers and soldiers. The largest attack was last month in the Sinai Peninsula, killing at least 31 soldiers. Analysts put the group's numbers at from the hundreds to roughly a thousand. While ABM's attacks, until now, have almost exclusively targeted the Egyptian government, there is growing fear that an association with ISIS could expand the threat to civilian and tourist sites. Egyptian security forces have been aggressively battling ABM since the overthrow of President Mohamed Morsy in 2013. Numerous checkpoints dot northern Sinai to prevent the movement of weapons and fighters. The threat to security forces operating in this area is so severe that at times, a shoot-on-sight curfew goes into effect between Arish, the largest city in northern Sinai, and the Rafah border crossing with Gaza, according to security officials. After October's attack, the government authorized a three-month curfew for the northern part of the peninsula. Officials in Egypt blame Hamas in Gaza for aiding the militant group, an accusation Hamas denies. Recently, the government relocated more than a thousand families away from the border in a move to eliminate cover for any tunnels between Egypt and Gaza and to create a buffer zone. AMB initially gained a foothold by exploiting the long-entrenched mistrust between local Bedouins and Egyptian authorities. The state of fear created by ABM eventually started to alienate many of northern Sinai's residents.  ABM lost support after assassinating Bedouin leaders who disagreed with their practices and beheading men accused of being informants. Before ISIS' rise to power, ABM was often associated with al Qaeda. Similar messages on social media proclaimed the group's allegiance to al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, only later to be denied by the militant group. In an article in Atlantic Council by Zack Gold, he said there ""appears to be an internal tussle in ABM over support for these international organizations."" He also argued that if the militant group associates itself with ISIS or al Qaeda then it would lose its status as a ""local hero"" and become a ""foreign agent."" Association with ISIS could also further damage ABM's image with most Egyptians. Egypt relies heavily on tourism and any organization that threatens this source of income risks loss of support. Egyptian State website Ahram Online published an article that reported ABM denied any allegiance to ISIS. U.S. State Department spokesperson Jen Psaki said the department will assess the issue. CNN has not been able to independently verify the authenticity of the audio message.","Ansar Beit al-Maqdis allegedly posts message on YouTube .

If true, this would be a new chapter for the deadliest group in Egypt ."
"(CNN)Shiver me timbers: Archaeologists have unveiled some unnerving medical tools found amid the wreckage of Blackbeard's Queen Anne's Revenge. Linda Carnes-McNaughton, a volunteer archaeologist on the project, recently presented what she and other researchers from the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources discovered about the equipment at the Society for Historical Archaeology's annual meeting. Among the more cringe-inducing findings were a urethral syringe used to inject mercury for the treatment of syphilis and a clyster pump used to deliver medical enemas for ""quicker absorption."" ""We just have to understand that these people were suffering,"" Carnes-McNaughton said. ""They were seeking relief for any kind of ailment, and certainly if there was warfare on the water, there were wounds among other ailments that needed treatment. It wasn't always a formally trained person in desperate times. That's probably more common than we know."" She added that this time period was still ""the era of mystical medical treatments"" and that outward symptoms were often treated rather than the underlying causes. Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard, ran the Queen Anne's Revenge aground in 1718. The shipwreck was discovered in 1996 off the coast of North Carolina, and archaeologists have completed about 60% of the excavation. Queen Anne's Revenge was originally La Concorde de Nantes, a French slave ship, that also carried three surgeons, or doctors, to ensure the wellness of those aboard. Those three surgeons remained with the ship after Blackbeard took over to help with the new crew's maladies.","Archaeologists excavated medical supplies from Blackbeard's ship .

"President Barack Obama said Monday that the United States has asked Iran to return a U.S. drone aircraft that Iran claims it recently brought down in Iranian territory. ""We've asked for it back. We'll see how the Iranians respond,"" Obama said in a news conference, alongside Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. A top Iranian military official previously vowed not to return the unmanned American stealth plane that it says it has. ""No nation welcomes other countries' spy drones in its territory, and no one sends back the spying equipment and its information back to the country of origin,"" said Gen. Hossein Salami, deputy commander of Iran's military, the semi-official Fars news agency reported Sunday. ""It makes no difference where this drone originated and which group or country sent it to invade our airspace,"" Salami said. ""This was an act of invasion and belligerence."" Shoes thrown at Iran's president . Former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney on Monday criticized Obama's decisions on the drone, but for an entirely different reason. He said that, after the aircraft went down, the president should have ordered an airstrike over Iran. ""The right response to that would have been to go in immediately after it had gone down and destroy it,"" the Republican, who served with President George W. Bush, told CNN's Erin Burnett. ""You can do that from the air ... and, in effect, make it impossible for them to benefit from having captured that drone."" Instead, ""he asked nicely for them to return it, and they aren't going to,"" Cheney said. American officials have not confirmed that the drone shown in a video released last Thursday by Iranian media is a U.S. aircraft. But Pentagon spokesman George Little has said that an American drone is missing and had not been recovered. Two U.S. officials have confirmed to CNN that the missing drone was part of a CIA reconnaissance mission that involved both the intelligence community and military personnel stationed in Afghanistan. Iran's official Iran Republic News Agency said the country's armed forces had downed the drone near Kashmar, some 225 kilometers (140 miles) from the border with Afghanistan on December 4. Salami said downing the plane was ""very valuable for us"" and ""a victory for us and a defeat for our enemies,"" IRNA reported. He also said  Iran had downed other drones earlier but had not announced those instances because they were not as important. Iranian TV has aired images of what it says is the drone, an apparently intact RQ-170 drone propped on a pedestal and triumphantly displayed. One U.S. official said the United States can't be certain it's the real stealth drone, because U.S. personnel don't have access to it. But he added there's no reason to think it's a fake.  However, a second senior U.S. military official said that a big question is to how the drone could have remained virtually intact given the high altitude it is believed to have crashed from. The condition of the drone in the video suggests it was not shot down but suffered a system failure, aviation analyst Bill Sweetman said. There are no burn marks from a fire, no holes and no outward damage. Sweetman noticed a dent along the leading edge but doesn't know what that means. ""It's fairly clear here from the pictures that the outer wings have been separated. The question is, did that happen in the accident or (did they take) them off to move the aircraft?"" Sweetman asked. Iran's U.N. ambassador said in a letter last week that the drone flew 250 kilometers (150 miles) into Iranian territory ""to the northern region of the city of Tabas."" The letter from Ambasador Mohammad Khazaee to U.N. Secretary-Genera Ban Ki-moon and the heads of the General Assembly and Security Council said the drone ""faced prompt and forceful action"" by the armed forces. ""My government emphasizes that this blatant and unprovoked air violation by the United States government is tantamount to an act of hostility against the Islamic Republic of Iran in clear contravention of international law, in particular, the basic tenets of the United Nations Charter,"" Khazaee's letter said. He called for U.N. condemnation of U.S. ""acts of aggression,"" as well as ""clear and effective measures to be taken to put an end to these dangerous and unlawful acts in line with the United Nations' responsibilities to maintain international and regional peace and security.""","Dick Cheney says Obama should have ordered a strike to destroy the fallen drone .

"Seven Hong Kong police officers have been arrested for assault over an alleged case of police brutality at pro-democracy protests last month which shocked residents of the Chinese territory. Footage of the alleged assault, taken by a TV crew at the city's main protest site in Admiralty on October 15, was widely disseminated online, sparking an outcry from the public, politicians and rights groups. It appeared to show officers leading the man to a dark corner, where he was laid on the ground and repeatedly kicked and punched while others stood around, keeping watch. The alleged victim was identified as Ken Tsang, a member of the Civic Party political group. He is also a social worker and a member of the 1,200 member election committee that chooses Hong Kong's leader. Photos were subsequently released by the Civic Party showing Tsang with a bruised face and welts on his back. In a statement Wednesday announcing the arrests, police addressed criticism they had taken too long to act, saying they had not delayed the handling of the case. The statement said Tsang had failed to show up to an identification parade Wednesday. Police hold Mong Kok . The announcement came as police and protesters again faced off in the Mong Kok district Wednesday evening, hours after authorities cleared barricades and tents from a demonstration camp and arrested prominent pro-democracy activists. The clearances, which began Tuesday, were carried out in accordance with court injunctions obtained by local business interests, following complaints that the protests have disrupted commercial life in the city. In a major operation Wednesday morning, police and bailiffs had worked to reopen a major road which had been occupied to varying extents since pro-democracy protests erupted nearly two months ago. But as day turned into evening -- and many Hong Kong residents left work -- the bustling commercial district once again filled with thousands of people, some of them protesters and others curious onlookers. Some activists yelled: ""We want to take back the streets!"" as they faced off with police and sought to stir up the crowds. As the atmosphere heated up, Hong Kong Chief Executive C.Y. Leung called on demonstrators not to reoccupy protest sites, according to public broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong. Police said 159 people had been arrested for various offenses at the Mong Kok protest site since Tuesday, when authorities began their push to clear the Mong Kok site. Charges have included resisting police, illegal assembly, possession of weapons and attacking police, according to Alice Tam of the Police Public Relations Branch. Civil disobedience . Joshua Wong, the 18-year-old founder of the student activist group Scholarism, was among a number of protest leaders arrested Wednesday as the demonstration camp was cleared. He was scheduled to appear in Kowloon City Court Thursday morning, according to Scholarism's social media accounts. Also detained were student leaders Lester Shum and Jason Szeto, according to Hong Kong Federation of Students spokeswoman Yvonne Leung. Prior to his arrest, Shum, the deputy secretary general of the student federation, told CNN he urged protesters to remain on the streets until they were arrested. ""We will still conduct our civil disobedience action until the last second,"" he said. Lawmaker and pro-democracy activist Leung Kwok-hung, commonly known as ""Long Hair,"" was among those arrested during confrontations in Mong Kok a day earlier, his office confirmed. In the wake of the Mong Kok clearance, the Hong Kong Federation of Students said it may target government buildings to build pressure against the government. ""I think we have made it very clear that if they [the police] continue the violent way of clearing up the place, we will have further actions,"" Leung told RTHK. ""The further actions include a possibility of some escalations pointed at government-related buildings or some of the government-related departments."" Universal suffrage . Pro-democracy protesters have occupied camps in parts of the city for nearly two months, including a main protest site outside government buildings in Admiralty on Hong Kong Island. Seeking universal suffrage, they want to be able to nominate candidates for the election of the city's chief executive in 2017. Instead, China's National People's Congress has said they'll be able to vote only for candidates from a shortlist approved by a pro-Beijing committee. Currently, the chief executive is elected by a specially appointed 1,200-member election committee. At the peak of the protests in early October, tens of thousands of people were on the streets at three locations. But numbers have dwindled as the protests have continued, and recent local polling suggests support has dipped. In a random survey of 513 people conducted by the University of Hong Kong, 83% said pro-democracy protesters should cease their occupation of major roads in Hong Kong, while just 13% said the protests should continue. Since the pro-democracy protests began on September 28, 421 people have been injured, including 79 women, the Hong Kong Information Services Department said.

"President Putin's endgame in Crimea is now clear -- and the West has only a few days to act. On Thursday, the Crimean parliament voted 78-0 to hold a referendum on March 16. The main question will ask whether voters want the region to secede from Ukraine and become part of Russia. Previously, a referendum had been scheduled for March 30 on the less politically charged question of whether Crimea should have greater autonomy within Ukraine. If, as expected, a majority endorses secession, the story will change overnight from one about Russia's unprovoked military invasion to one about a minority's right to self-determination. That is the Kremlin's plan. European leaders, already having trouble agreeing on a response to naked aggression, will find it much harder to oppose the popular will of the Crimean people. At that point, risky actions to force Crimea back into Ukraine will become difficult for Western politicians to explain to their own domestic voters. The legal status of the planned referendum is more than murky. Ukrainian acting president Oleksandr Turchynov has called it a ""farce"" and a ""crime against the nation."" But, for democratic politicians -- and the societies they represent -- going against a majority vote is never easy. If Russia can change the subject in this way, Crimean secession will become an established fact. Putin, who assured journalists on Tuesday that Russia did not mean to annex Crimea, will then be able to claim that he was ""forced to yield to the will of the people."" With just a few days to turn the situation around, temporizing needs to stop. Allowing Russia ""more time"" at this point, as some European leaders have proposed, is exactly what the West should not do. That Russia's Crimean clients have moved the referendum date forward suggests nervousness in Moscow -- and a recognition that time is of the essence. In the remaining time before March 16, the West must convince both the Kremlin-connected Russian elite and the population of Crimea that the region's secession to Russia would be a mistake. Direct threats are counterproductive, but clearly and calmly articulating the consequences of such a move can produce results. First, all the European Union states plus the United States should make absolutely clear that they will not recognize the results of a referendum held while armed bands of ""self-defense forces"" roam Crimea. Any decision to secede that results from such a referendum will be considered illegitimate. To increase Moscow's isolation, it is worth exploring whether a large majority would support a resolution in the United Nations General Assembly -- of course, Russia would veto in the Security Council -- reasserting the inviolability of borders in this case. Second, the EU and U.S. should announce that economic relations would be frozen between the West and a Crimea in legal limbo following secession. In part, this freeze would be enforced by the markets themselves. Crimea's tourism industry would have to forget about attracting Western visitors to the region's beaches. International investors would demand huge risk premiums. But Western restrictions on investment and trade with Crimea could amplify the effect. The region's agricultural produce could be banned from European and Ukrainian markets. Crimeans must be helped to understand the choice they face: between becoming another Abkhazia -- a failed statelet on intravenous drip from Moscow -- or a flourishing region within the new, broader Europe. The EU should quickly earmark some portion of the 11 billion euros already promised to Ukraine for projects to develop Crimea's economy if it remains Ukrainian. Third, the United States should work out a set of restrictions to place on Russian banks and corporations that do business in a Crimea that has illegally seceded. As economist Anders Aslund has pointed out, existing rules against money laundering could be enforced more rigorously against various Russian entities. All of this needs to be done rapidly. While Washington has reacted quickly as the crisis unfolded, the EU has suffered from its chronic lack of central decision-making authority. The next few days constitute a test. If Brussels cannot forge a strong, common position in time, then management of future crises will simply revert to the foreign ministries of Germany, France, and Britain, with the EU's foreign policy role narrowed to coordinating long-term policies. While spelling out the costs that threaten the Crimean population and the Russian political elite, Western leaders must continue to devise ""off-ramps"" to outcomes that Putin could conceivably accept, but that, nevertheless, will not be seen as rewarding aggression. The West can call for a significant increase in Crimea's political autonomy within Ukraine, negotiated with Kiev. U.S. and European leaders should also speak out far more audibly in favor of minority language and cultural rights. They should have responded with outrage when the Rada, Ukraine's parliament, canceled the status of Russian as an official language and should now praise the promised veto of this law. It may still be possible to prevent the illegal annexation of Crimea. Putin is sensitive to the danger of splits within his political elite. The West must show him that he has underestimated the extent of political isolation and economic disruption that annexation would cause. It must work on winning the hearts and minds of the Crimean population. The clock is ticking.","Daniel Treisman: Only a few days are left to stop the Crimea breakaway .

"Intense fighting broke out in eastern Ukraine on Monday when government air and ground forces attacked pro-Russian separatist gunmen who had seized an airport terminal. The clashes between Ukraine's Army and separatists in Donetsk have caused some casualties, according to a statement posted on the official website of the city's mayor, which also advised residents to stay in their homes. A CNN team in the city observed a Ukrainian combat helicopter flying over the Donetsk airport and firing at something. It was unclear what the target was. Black smoke billowed up from the area. Pro-Russian separatists shot at the helicopter as it flew overhead. Gunfire and explosions could be heard in the city. The fighting marked the worst violence that this key population center in eastern Ukraine has seen since the start of the crisis. And the violence came hours after newly elected Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said he'd potentially like to negotiate a way out of the crisis. Authorities canceled all flights after separatists stormed and seized Donetsk's airport terminal, according to the national news agency of Ukraine, Ukrinform. The separatists ignored a government ultimatum to vacate the premises, Ukrinform reported. After a Ukrainian military plane ""made a preliminary shot,"" paratroopers landed and began clearing the airport, Ukrinform reported. In the fighting, a separatist anti-aircraft gun was destroyed, Ukrinform said. Though the Ukrainian government said it was taking control, CNN reporters who witnessed the action saw separatist reinforcements moving toward the airport in trucks. Both sides later claimed they held the airport. Government officials claimed flights would resume by 9 a.m. on Tuesday. The State Border Service of Ukraine said that up to 40 trucks with gunmen had been spotted on Russian territory within 10 kilometers of Donetsk.","Clashes have caused some casualties, a statement from the mayor's office says .

"The Syrian government is ready to send envoys to Moscow for talks with representatives of the opposition it has been fighting in a brutal civil war for over 3½ years, according to state-run media.

"President Barack Obama joined the call for calm with word a Missouri grand jury considering whether to indict Officer Darren Wilson in the death of Michael Brown was close to making a decision. ""This is a country that allows everybody to express their views. Allows them to peacefully assemble, to protest actions that they think are unjust,"" the President told ABC News in an interview excerpt broadcast on Friday. ""But using any event as an excuse for violence is contrary to rule of law and contrary to who we are."" The President's comments came as the grand jury considers whether to bring charges against Wilson, who is in the final stages of negotiations with Ferguson city officials to resign, sources close to the talks told CNN. Wilson has maintained he's done nothing wrong, and the resignation talks have hinged on whether he is indicted, the sources said. While Wilson has told associates he would resign to help ease pressure and protect his fellow officers, he has expressed concern about resigning while the grand jury was still hearing evidence for fear it would appear he was admitting fault. What charges could Officer Wilson face? The talks could still collapse, the sources close to the talks said. Wilson doesn't know what the grand jury will do and, if they opt to charge him, he could change his mind. Wilson, who has six years on the force with no disciplinary issues on his record, is currently on paid administrative leave. If he returns to duty, he will have to undergo two psychological evaluations, authorities have said. What is known, what is not . The basic facts of the case -- Wilson, a white police officer, fatally shot Brown, a black 18-year-old who was unarmed, on August 9 -- are not in dispute. Most everything else about the case is, leading to emotionally and racially charged divisions about what should happen next. The officer's supporters have claimed Wilson fired only in self-defense, pointing to witness testimony and leaked grand jury documents that suggest Brown might have attacked Wilson, struggled for his gun and perhaps charged the officer moments later. Brown's backers have been likewise adamant in blaming Wilson, claiming the officer shot a young man who, according to some accounts, was holding up his hands in surrender. This dispute as to what happened at that crucial moment, the handing of the investigation from the outset and the fact that charges were not brought against Wilson sparked days of protests on the streets of Ferguson. The ensuing police response, which many have called heavy-handed, and the violence, property damage and looting of some during the protests only deepened the sense of mistrust.

Once the grand jury decision is made, prosecutors are expected to provide law enforcement with 48 hours notice before making a public announcement. The current plans could still change and prosecutors could shift the planned grand jury session. Meanwhile, authorities are on guard for a repeat of large-scale demonstrations and possibly violence -- as happened in the days after the shooting, when heavily armed police came face to face with angry protesters. A number of business owner boarded their doors and windows. Some people made plans to stay indoors this weekend. Others made plans to take to the streets to protest. ""I hope something really good comes out of all of this. Otherwise, he would have died in vain,"" said Stoney Shaw, pastor at First Baptist Church Ferguson, referring to Brown. The tension was not visible, but palpable, in the words of Ferguson residents. Barber shop owner Marty Buchheit said he was seeing half as many clients these days. ""I'm just waiting until this thing airs out and I see what I got left,"" he said. Demonstrations, as well as sporadic arrests, have continued for weeks, including some on Thursday night. According to St. Louis County police spokesman Brian Schellman, ""several vocal and defiant protesters"" shut down one lane of traffic in Ferguson and chased after some cars on foot. Some of those protesters left the street at officers' request, only to return to block traffic once again, he said. Eventually, after announcements to get off the street, a ""skirmish line of officers"" moved in and arrested three people who remained, Schellman said. One of them was pepper-sprayed after pushing an officer, according to the police spokesman. Precautions and plans . The prospect of more disputes and violence after the grand jury ruling is announced spurred officials and citizens to take precautions. The school district for Jennings, Missouri -- which neighbors Ferguson -- has canceled classes for Monday and Tuesday of next week, according to its Facebook page. School district officials did not immediately return to CNN's calls for comment on why classes were canceled. On Tuesday, Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency. And, along Ferguson's West Florissant Avenue -- ground zero for violent protests -- businesses put back the plywood boards they had taken down from their windows and doors. The FBI has sent dozens of extra personnel, including FBI police officers, mostly to guard their offices around the St. Louis area and boost personnel, a law enforcement official said. Additionally a separate law enforcement official said the ATF has sent in extra personnel including SWAT team members. St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said his officers are ready for whatever happens. ""We've had three months to prepare. ... Acts of violence will not be tolerated,"" he said. ""Our intelligence is good. Our tactics are good. We can protect lawful people and at the same time arrest criminals."" There are concerns that communities well beyond Ferguson could see unrest after the grand jury's decision comes down. Brown's father calls for calm ahead of decision . The Ferguson National Response Network has set up a Tumblr account advertising about 70 ""planned responses"" to the ruling. They will take place from West Palm Beach, Florida, to New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. In a video message released Friday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced new guidelines for ""law enforcement about how to approach maintaining order during First Amendment-protected events."" Holder spoke about the duty of law enforcement to protect the public, while urging demonstrators to not revert to violence. He also said that some of the issues raised in the wake of Brown's death -- about things like ""police practices, implicit bias and pervasive community distrust"" -- are ""real and significant."" ""I recognize that progress will not come easily, and long-simmering tensions will not be cooled overnight,"" Holder said. ""These struggles go to the heart of who we are and who we aspire to be, both as a nation and as a people. And it is clear that we have a great deal of important work still to do.""

"(CNN) -- In the last few days, two Ukrainian warplanes were brought down over Eastern Ukraine (one allegedly by a Russian jet) and on Thursday a Malaysia Airlines passenger plane crashed in the area, apparently with the loss of all 298 souls on board. If it turns out that the unfortunate civilian airliner was also shot down, Russia and its local allies could again be implicated. Understandably, the international community will wonder whether this portends an escalation in the Kremlin ambitions there. Vice President Joe Biden is already sure he knows what happened, telling an audience in Detroit on Thursday that the plane has ""been shot down, not an accident. Blown out of the sky."" Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko calls this ""an act of terrorism"" and is pointing the rhetorical finger at Moscow. While all the facts are not yet in, it is indeed possible that a Russian surface-to-air missile brought the civilian plane down. If so, Russia or its Ukrainian separatist allies bear heavy responsibility for this tragedy. But that would not indicate that Russian President Vladimir Putin's overall strategy in the region has changed. If a Russian missile did bring down MH17, it is likely that it was the result of a tragic error, a case of mistaken identity, rather than an intentional act by either the Russian military or their Ukrainian separatist allies. Such accidents are sadly not unprecedented. In 1983, Soviet Air Defense Forces tracking an American electronic reconnaissance plane operating near their naval facilities on the Kamchatka Peninsula mistakenly shot down Korean Airlines Flight 007 with the loss of 269 passengers, including a hard-line anticommunist U.S. congressman. And during the Tanker War in the Persian Gulf in 1988, a U.S. Navy AEGIS cruiser -- the USS Vincennes -- mistook Iran Air Flight 655 for an attacking Iranian warplane and shot it down, killing 290 civilians. Such tragic accidents happen in wartime or periods of heightened international tensions. If it turns out that this is what happened in this case, the Russian military and their Ukrainian allies will suffer a well-deserved black eye. The Russian Air Defense Forces ought to have been able to distinguish a civilian airliner, operating on a previously filed flight plan and with its electronic identification systems operating, from Ukrainian warplanes. If they gave a high-altitude system to the Ukrainian separatists, then they also should have anticipated that an accident like this could have happened given that the Donetsk Republic has only primitive radar systems. But there is blame to go around. Why did MH17's flight path take it right over a war zone in which two warplanes had just been shot down? You have to wonder what the airline and the Ukrainian and Russian civilian air controllers were thinking. Even if events transpired as Biden and Poroshenko surmise, it's unlikely to indicate any major change in the Kremlin's ambitions in Eastern Ukraine. There is no evidence that Putin has deviated from his strategy of keeping the pot boiling in the region and begun moving toward something more ambitious. Indeed, all the evidence suggests that he understands that the Donetsk Republic is not the Crimea. The best he can hope for is to use the pro-Russian insurgency as a lever to pry Kiev out of its increasingly Western orientation and as a bargaining chip with the new Ukrainian regime to get it to adopt a more federal political system that will keep Ukraine suspended between East and West. This is, of course, a cold-blooded Machiavellian strategy of realpolitik. But such a cynical approach to the Eastern Ukraine is not incompatible with this event being nothing more than a tragic blunder.","Malaysia Airlines passenger plane possibly was shot down in Ukraine .

"After several months of airstrikes, the international coalition's operation against ISIS in Syria has failed to dismantle the group's structure of command and has pushed its militants further beyond the country's borders. Civilians and opposition rebel forces have been left frustrated by the coalition's narrow focus, lack of a clear agenda and apparent failure to take into consideration the dynamics of the wider Syrian conflict. Late last month, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem said that without U.N. Security Council approval, the U.S. strikes lacked legitimacy. But in comments to media he said: ""Anyway, if their aim is to strike against ISIS, it's OK."" Does this statement mean that the Syrian government views the coalition strikes as beneficial to its hold on power? Does the old Arab proverb the ""enemy of my enemy is my friend"" apply to this case and to the reality on the ground? In the short term, the international coalition's counter-terrorism strategy may certainly be in the interests of the Assad regime. Military strikes are to some extent forcing ISIS fighters to retreat from territories under their control in northern and eastern Syria. Other opposition groups -- including the Free Syrian Army -- are unlikely to have the capability to take advantage of these strikes. The Syrian military is still superior when it comes to aerial force and may be best placed to retake ISIS territories. Although the Gulf states would like to see an anti-ISIS offensive that would ultimately lead to the collapse of the Syrian government, the U.S. and Western allies have made it clear that regime change is not an objective of this military campaign. Coalition strikes have not been targeting the Syrian government's military forces or infrastructure. Thus the Syrian government has found the U.S., Western allies, and Arab states on the side of its own allies Russia and the Islamic Republic of Iran -- aiding Assad against one of his most powerful and influential threats. Ironically, the same nations that may have indirectly contributed to the creation of ISIS itself, are now investing their military capital into fighting it. So far, however, the balance of power has not shifted significantly either in favor of the government forces or rebel groups. ISIS has been pushed out of some territories, but is advancing in others. Although government forces have made slight advances in Aleppo, resource constraints have prevented the military from taking full advantage of the coalition strikes. Strategically, Assad needs to focus on holding the large cities already under government control. Civilian suffering . More fundamentally, the coalition's anti-ISIS campaign has deflected attention from the Syrian government and armed rebel group's atrocities against civilians. There are claims the Assad government has in fact ratcheted up its attacks in the shadow of the strikes. The opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights on Thursday reported that regime airstrikes had killed 221 civilians, ""taking advantage of the international media focusing on ISIS and Ein al-Arab 'Kobani'."" Syrian civilians might also question why the international community decided to intervene against ISIS after ignoring -- for several years -- the Syrian government's brutality in a conflict that has led to more than 190,000 deaths and more than 3,200,000 refugees. The offensive has not alleviated the humanitarian crisis facing the Syrian people and the strikes' unintended consequences -- civilian casualties -- are increasingly leading to a domestic outcry against such intervention. Tackling the disease . For some, the question is why the coalition does not address the fundamental roots of the war, tackling the disease itself rather than the symptoms. On a long term basis, the coalition strikes against ISIS in Syria will inevitably keep expanding, working to escalate the conflict. A strategic shift to target the Syrian government's military infrastructure is unlikely as many regional and international state actors have a stake in Syria. Coalition training may gradually improve some of the Syrian rebel groups' military capabilities and strategic planning but the current balance of power between the government forces and various rebel and armed groups will likely continue. Domestic, regional, international and non-state players will continue to pursue their own goals. Amid ongoing instability and competing interests, Syria's social and political environment will be ripe for further radicalization, militarization and ultimately further civilian suffering. In the end, both ISIS and Assad may be the beneficiaries of the foreign airstrikes, using them as a pretext to further advance their political interests. A narrow and short-term counter-terrorism strategy that fails to take into account the many layers of the wider Syrian conflict is unlikely to succeed.","Syria has said coalition strikes lack legitimacy but aim of striking ISIS is OK .
Majid Rafizadeh says in the short term, coalition strikes may help the Assad regime .
But he says the coalition strategy fails to take the wider conflict into account .
The conflict will continue to escalate and Syrian civilians will suffer, he says ."
"American jets began bombing ISIS targets in Syria early Tuesday, raising U.S. involvement in the war-torn country and sending a forceful message to the terror group. The airstrikes focused on the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, a U.S. official told CNN, though other locations were hit as well. At least 20 targets in an around Raqqa were hit, the opposition group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. They're the first strikes against the terror group inside the country since President Barack Obama's announcement this month that he was prepared to expand the American efforts beyond targets in Iraq. All foreign partners participating in the strikes with the United States are Arab countries, a senior U.S. military official told CNN. Those nations are Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan. Diplomatic sources told CNN that Qatar was also involved, though it was not clear whether Qatar actually conducted airstrikes itself. Get the latest updates on CNN.com's live blog . The U.S. and ""partner nation forces"" began striking ISIS targets using fighters, bombers and Tomahawk missiles, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said, though he didn't specify a geographic location. Citing the ongoing operations, Kirby said the Pentagon would not provide additional details immediately. But a U.S. military official said the strikes are meant to target the ability of ISIS to command and control, resupply and train. Western allies reject ISIS leader's threats . Tomahawk missiles launched from the sea initiated the strike, followed by bombers and fighters, a senior U.S. military official told CNN. The goal with this first move is to have an initial, definitive blow, the official said, describing the pace of the operation as intense. Most of the spots hit were hard targets such as buildings, a senior U.S. official told CNN. A post office, a recruitment center and a building in the governor's compound were among the structures in Raqqa hit by U.S. airstrikes, Syrian opposition activists said. There was no immediate word about casualties, the activists said. Power went out in the city shortly after the airstrikes but was restored later Tuesday morning. A 'punch in the nose' Until now, ISIS has been able to take over cities and operate in Syria with near impunity. Now, it's coming under attack. ""This is the punch in the nose to the bully that we talked about on the playground,"" former Delta Force officer James Reese said.  ""ISIS is the bully, and we just punched him in the nose."" Finding the 'right' rebels in Syria: One tough job . With the airstrikes, the United States enters a new level of engagement in the ongoing Syrian civil war. Obama had resisted U.S. military action in Syria, but as the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq made sweeping advances in both Middle Eastern neighbors, calls for such a step grew. ""I have made it clear that we will hunt down terrorists who threaten our country, wherever they are,"" Obama said in a September 10 speech. ""That means I will not hesitate to take action against ISIL in Syria, as well as Iraq. This is a core principle of my presidency: if you threaten America, you will find no safe haven."" The message of the speech was clear -- it was a matter of when, not if -- the United States would carry out airstrikes inside Syria. A U.S. intelligence official said that while law enforcement is aware the airstrikes against ISIS in Syria could incite a response, there is no evidence to suggest any terrorist strike is in the works against the United States. 200,000 flee in biggest displacement of Syrian conflict . Last week, U.S. officials told CNN that the military had everything in place it needed to strike ISIS inside Syria and was awaiting Obama's go-ahead to do so. For weeks, intelligence and military targeting specialists have been working around the clock on a list of targets, the officials said. It is unlikely that the President reviewed all the targets individually, but was presented broad guidance with analysis about the risks of bombing inside Syria, as well as the rewards in terms of attacking ISIS. Al Qaeda's new Syrian franchise has a mission: Attack the West . Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel told the House Armed Services Committee last week that he and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey signed off on plans to strike ISIS in Syria. ""CENTCOM's plan includes targeted actions against ISIL safe havens in Syria -- including its command and control, logistics capabilities, and infrastructure,"" Hagel said last week. ""Our actions will not be restrained by a border that exists in name only.""

"Maram scrunches up her little nose and pauses as she remembers. The eight-year-old was daddy's favorite. ""When he was going to work he was shot,"" she says. By whom, no one can say for sure, but Syria's merciless war does not differentiate between combatant and civilian -- and it is leaving behind countless children like Maram who have lost one or both parents along with their innocence. ""I saw him when they brought him to the house when he was dead,"" Maram continues. ""I said 'God have mercy on you' and I prayed."" She has an inquisitive, heart-shaped face. She listens intently to our questions, and often stops to think before answering. ""I would see him in my dreams, I would see him giving someone something or taking someone somewhere. I used to see him, but now I don't anymore."" She is one of around 34 children between the ages of two and 10 who live during the week at the Beyti Orphanage in southwest Turkey, near the Syrian border. Their fathers are all dead -- some lost to illness and some, like Maram's dad, to the violence consuming Syria. Their mothers, refugees in Turkey, can't afford to properly clothe and feed them. At Beyti there is bath time, fresh clothes, and beds to sleep on. There are toys to replace those that the children had to leave behind, regular hot healthy meals, and clean water to wash with. Maram and her friend Mohammed whisper next to me on the couch. He pulls a tie out of his pocket. ""Someone was giving them out,"" he explains. The pair erupt in giggles as Maram tries to put it on him. Her father had taught her how to tie the knot, but she doesn't really remember. ""Are you guys best friends?"" I ask. ""We're not friends, we're siblings,"" Mohammed replies. Maram looks at me, her eyes open wide, and she smiles. ""He considers himself my brother,"" she tells me. ""We're all family here,"" another child pipes in. The Beytin Orphage, which opened in September, was established by the Maram Foundation. It was named not the little girl we met, but for another of the same name who was paralyzed from the waist down by a shrapnel wound to her spine. ""We're trying to raise our children away from all of the ideologies happening inside Syria,"" Beyti's co-founder Yakzan Shishakly tells us, alluding to the radical extremist violent Muslim ideology that is thriving in his homeland. ""And we also want to give them the right to have a normal life away from the war because of the regime."" The focus here is not only on trying to create a ""normal"" environment, but also on helping these children heal from the trauma they witnessed. ""There were some cases that were very obvious, those were the cases of anger and aggression,"" says Mayada Abdi, head of the orphanage, describing some of the children who have come to Beyti since it opened. Maram was very solitary when she first arrived, preferring to stay alone. ""She would remember things that were beautiful memories that were taken from her, especially those that were tied to her father, all her trips,"" Abdi says. ""All her stories are about her father. So you would often find her sitting remembering those times."" Nothing can alter the inexplicable pain brought into these children's lives by violence that defies logic, from a war they are too young to understand. But at least here they have a chance to perhaps move past it and salvage what they can of their childhood. Maram, for one, is already looking to the future. ""I want to be an Arabic teacher,"" she says. ""Back home in Syria.""","Thousands of children have lost one or both parents during Syria's brutal civil war .

"(CNN)A federal investigation has not found enough evidence to charge Darren Wilson with the federal crime of depriving Michael Brown of his civil rights, according to multiple sources familiar with the investigation. The FBI has completed its investigation into the August shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, and sent the findings to the Justice Department, a law enforcement official and a separate U.S. official said Wednesday. Justice Department prosecutors will not recommend civil rights charges against Wilson, who killed Brown, because there is not sufficient evidence to support charges, a U.S. official told CNN. The New York Times first reported the development Wednesday. A grand jury decided not to indict Wilson on state charges in November. However, the final Justice Department report has not been completed. The FBI joined local officials in interviewing over 200 people and looked at much the same evidence as the grand jury. What are the Brown family's options? Ultimately, the decision will be made by Attorney General Eric Holder, who has said he will announce a decision before he leaves office, which is expected to be by spring. Another Justice Department civil rights investigation into the Ferguson Police Department's overall track record with minorities is ongoing. Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Brown's family, declined to comment on the news Wednesday. ""The family of Michael Brown Jr. will wait for official word from the Justice Department regarding whether or not any charges will be filed against the police officer who shot and killed him,"" Crump said in a written statement released Wednesday. ""The family won't address speculation from anonymous sources."" Months of protests over alleged police brutality and racial profiling surged in Ferguson and across the country after Wilson, a white officer, killed Brown, an unarmed African-American teen. Legal experts have long noted that a federal civil rights case against Wilson would be more difficult to prove. ""The bar is extraordinarily high,"" said Joey Jackson, a criminal defense attorney and legal analyst for CNN's sister network HLN. ""You have to show an intentional deprivation of a civil right."" Given how difficult it is to prove intent, and also how many conflicting accounts emerged from the grand jury investigation, ""it would be very difficult to move forward federally with a civil rights charge,"" Jackson said. If no federal charges are brought against Wilson, who resigned from his position as a Ferguson Police officer in November, some people in the area will be disappointed, said Antonio French, a St. Louis city alderman who lives near Ferguson. ""I think you have a lot of people who will be disappointed if this does turn out to be the case. The community and the family wanted a day in court, an opportunity to see all the evidence laid out, cross-examined,"" French said. ""And it looks like that's not going to happen. I hope we don't have any violence as a result of this."" Violent protests erupted in Ferguson after the grand jury's decision not to indict Wilson in November.  Police are still searching for suspects accused of looting. Protests aren't likely to stop any time soon, French said. ""People have a right to protest. We will probably continue to see that. That's a good thing. But we want to keep them peaceful, nonviolent,"" he said. ""Because violence makes the situation worse. It divides the community in a time we need to come together and make everyone feel like they can get equal protection."" Ultimately, he said, some of the protesters' goals can be achieved outside the courts. ""The next steps I think are legislative change,"" French said, ""trying to make sure that in cases like this we get a special prosecutor by law, and to create a new level of civilian oversight over police departments."" In his State of the State speech on Wednesday, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said addressing ""the broader, systemic issues"" raised by the unrest that followed the killing of Brown would demand ""sustained effort."" ""The legacy of Ferguson will be determined by what we do next ... to foster healing and hope ... and the changes we make to strengthen all of our communities,"" he said. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Dave Alsup, Jethro Mullen and Wolf Blitzer contributed to this report.","Federal investigators have been looking into the Michael Brown shooting .

"Away from the urban frontline of Hong Kong's democracy protests, the push for a free vote is straining diplomatic ties between China and the territory's former colonial master, Britain. British Prime Minister David Cameron was reported to have expressed concern on Monday about China's refusal to allow a Foreign Affairs Committee entry to Hong Kong. ""This only amplifies concerns, rather than diminishing them,"" said a spokesman for the prime minister, according to the Telegraph. ""The reason that the prime minister thinks it is a mistaken decision is because it is counter-productive,"" the spokesman added. An emergency debate will be held in the House of Commons on Tuesday to discuss the Chinese ban. The committee had planned to travel to Hong Kong in late December to assess ""British diplomatic work"" in the Chinese territory, amid increasingly heated scenes between pro-democracy campaigners and police. For the past two months, protesters have blocked busy roads in the city, establishing tent communities with the aim of pressuring the Hong Kong government to talk. After an initial round, the government declined further talks and has urged the protesters -- mostly students -- to abandon their action. Protesters are opposing the government's plans to allow a committee to select a short-list of candidates for the role of chief executive in 2017. They want a free and fair vote. Chinese opposition . In a regular press briefing on Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying took issue with  comments from committee chairman Sir Richard Ottoway, who on Friday described the Chinese decision to ban the group as ""overtly confrontational."" ""China said many times to Britain it resolutely opposed the so-called delegation of the British parliament's foreign affairs committee going to Hong Kong for a so-called investigation and asked they cancel the visit."" ""If certain British MPs are bent on doing this, that's what is meant by overt confrontation and this is not beneficial for Sino-British ties,"" she added. In a statement the British Foreign Office said the Chinese ban was ""regrettable"" and ""not consistent with the positive trend in UK-China relations over the past year."" It said it had communicated that to the Chinese "" at the most senior levels."" Ottoway said on Monday that the group would not be pressured by the Chinese government to abandon its inquiry, ""nor are we going to cancel plans to hear from people in Hong Kong,"" he said. He said China's Deputy Ambassador to the UK Ni Jian had told him: ""Hong Kong came back to China 17 years ago, it is a Chinese territory and we oppose any interference in its internal affairs."" Ottoway also said he was told the delegation ""may send the wrong signals to the figures of 'Occupy Central'"" and ""shows some encouragement for illegal actions."" The inquiry, which began in July, will examine how the British Foreign Office ""monitors"" the Joint Declaration signed between the UK and China 30 years ago when the countries agreed the transfer of Hong Kong from British to Chinese rule.","China has barred British Foreign Office committee from entering Hong Kong .

"A billionaire who jointly controls Asia's biggest property development company and a former No. 2 official of Hong Kong were found guilty of conspiracy to commit misconduct in the city's biggest corruption trial. The tycoon, Thomas Kwok along with his younger brother, Raymond Kwok were accused of bribing Rafael Hui, the government official, in offenses spanning nearly a decade. The Kwok brothers, who rank 86th on the 2014 Forbes list of the world's richest people, are co-chairs of the developer giant Sun Hung Kai, which is responsible for many of Hong Kong's most iconic skyscrapers. The main question during their trial was whether the brothers had bought the allegiance of Hui, Hong Kong's former chief secretary. After five days of deliberation, a Hong Kong High Court jury found the older Kwok guilty of bribing Hui between 2005 and 2007. Immediately after the verdict, Thomas Kwok resigned from his position at Sun Hung Kai, and his son, Adam Kwok was named the company's next executive director. Meanwhile, his younger brother, Raymond Kwok was cleared of all charges. Hui is the highest-ranking former official to face trial in Hong Kong. The court looked into whether Hui received monetary and housing benefits worth at least $4.3 million from the Kwoks in return for government decisions favorable to the company. The charges related to accepting rent-free apartments, unsecured loans and a consultancy agreement with the property company. The jury found him guilty on three counts of misconduct in a public office, conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office and conspiracy to offer an advantage to a public servant. The jury also found Thomas Chan, who was responsible for land acquisition at the company and Francis Kwan, a former Hong Kong Stock Exchange official, guilty for making a series of payments to Hui. The sentencing hearing for the four who were convicted will be held Monday. Raymond Kwok was released from custody after his arrest in 2012. As he left the court, Kwok said he had mixed feelings that he was free, but his brother had been found guilty. The case caused a media frenzy in the city, where real estate is a local obsession. Sun Hung Kai, which helped to build some of the tallest buildings in the city's celebrated skyline, contributed to the Kwok brothers' estimated $18.3 billion fortune. Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, is considered to be one of the world's least corrupt territories. According to Transparency International's 2013 Corruptions Perceptions Index, Hong Kong is the 15th least corrupt territory in the world -- with the United States, by comparison, ranked 19th.","Property tycoon Thomas Kwok found guilty on misconduct charge .

"(CNN) -- A massive typhoon crept across central Philippines on Sunday, sending thousands of people into shelters and pouring heavy rain that heightened the risk of flooding and landslides. Typhoon Hagupit -- its name means ""lash"" in Filipino -- moved west-northwest and targeted the city of Legazpi, just north of where the storm made landfall on Saturday. CNN's Saima Mohsin, reporting from Legazpi on Sunday, said shelters were full as high winds and driving rain battered the city. One of the city's major fears is a storm surge that could reach 2-4 meters (6.5 to 13 feet). With memories of last year's devastating super typhoon fresh in their minds, more than 600,000 people had evacuated by Saturday morning, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. About 40 million people are in the path of the storm's winds. Gen. Gregorio Catapang, chief of staff of armed forces, said at a Sunday press conference that soldiers were working to clear roads and airports so that emergency services could be delivered. Eleven nations had offered assistance, including the Australia, the United States, China, Japan and the United Kingdom. CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam said that the storm is actually breaking up over the land mass of the Philippines, but will continue to pour heavy rain. He said 395 mm (15.5 inches) of rain were reported in Bororgan in 24 hours. Hagupit is moving slowly on its west-northwest track, at 15 kph (9.3 mph). At that rate, it will take about three days for the storm to travel past the capital, Manila, dumping extreme amounts of rainfall -- more than a foot in some places -- as it goes. Expected to lose some punch by Manila . Hagupit should be significantly weaker by the time it reaches Manila, but winds will still be higher than 100 kph (60 mph). The biggest threat in the capital will come from the heavy rainfall. That will lead to flash flooding and mudslides, even in places far away from the storm's center. Despite the threats of danger, a CNN crew in Legazpi saw many residents who were ignoring evacuation orders and vowing to stay in their makeshift beachside homes. ""I think we can handle the situation. If or when it gets worse, we'll go to the evacuation center,"" one man said. ""We've been here 25 years and seen many typhoons,"" said a woman at the coast. ""This one already feels stronger than Typhoon Haiyan, but we won't leave yet."" The typhoon came ashore on eastern Samar Island just before 10 p.m. (9 a.m. ET) with winds of 205 kph (127 mph) -- the equivalent of a Category 3 hurricane. Town ravaged last year escapes major damage . One city farther south breathed a sigh of relief on Sunday. In Tacloban, the streets were empty because residents had already evacuated. Last year, super typhoon Haiyan devastated Tacloban, killing more than 6,000 people and making around 200,000 people homeless. Mayor Alfred Romualdez told CNN the city is without power but he's seen only minor damage with broken windows and trees down. Many roads were flooded, but not impassable. About 48,000 people have moved to evacuation centers, he said; there have been no casualties. CNN's Asia-Pacific editor Andrew Stephens, reporting from Tacloban, said there was no storm surge. ""The main emotion here is one of relief,"" he said. Fishermen fears typhoon will ""destroy everything"" ""There was a lot of preparation,"" Orla Fagan, spokeswoman for the United Nations humanitarian agency OCHA, told CNN.

"Five more lifeless bodies have been found on the slopes of Japan's Mount Ontake, bringing the total number of presumed dead in a volcanic eruption Saturday to 36. Twenty-four bodies still remain on the mountain, while 12 have been recovered, identified and pronounced dead, Nagano Prefecture Police said Monday. The search for more missing hikers has been suspended due to dangerous conditions at summit. Hydrogen sulfide gas is being spewed from the mountain, police said, putting rescuers in danger. The volcano in central Japan unleashed a huge cloud of ash late Saturday morning that billowed down the mountainside and engulfed hikers in its path. Witnesses described hearing a sound like thunder when the eruption began. Desperate relatives . Relatives of the missing gathered near Mount Ontake over the weekend desperately seeking information. Among them was Kiyokazu Tokoro from nearby Aichi prefecture, whose son, Yuki, was hiking on the volcano with his girlfriend. He said he knew they were near the summit at the time of the eruption because his son's girlfriend had sent a photo to a friend minutes beforehand. ""All I can do is beg for your help to get information,"" he told CNN. ""Please help us."" Authorities estimated there were 200 to 250 hikers in the area at the time of the eruption. Most of them were reported to have managed to make the long trek down the mountain. But some people remained trapped in several lodges on Mount Ontake, and others were missing altogether, local authorities said. More than 350 rescue workers -- a mix of police, firefighters and military personnel -- began climbing two separate routes up the mountain on Sunday morning, authorities in the nearby village of Otaki said. They said they observed 17-20 inches (40-50 centimeters) of volcanic ash covering the ground in some areas. High alert . The Japan Meteorological Agency has raised the Volcanic Alert Level for Ontake from 1 to 3. That means the public is advised to not approach the volcano, the summit of which is at an altitude of 10,060 feet (3,067 meters). The agency warned that another large eruption could take place in the next six days or so. Small continuous eruptions continued Sunday. The volcano's plume of smoke and ash was reported to have disrupted air travel in Japan, causing delays at several airports. Mount Ontake, the second tallest volcano in Japan, after Mount Fuji, is a popular destination for hikers, especially in the fall when the foliage's rich autumn colors are on display. The last major eruption of Mount Ontake, which is about 125 miles (200 kilometers) west of Tokyo, took place in 1979, according to the Global Volcanism Program at the Smithsonian Institute. That eruption lasted months, spewing out more than 200,000 tons of ash, the Japanese news agency Kyodo reported.","36 people are now presumed dead following volcanic eruption .

"At least 95 people have been killed and 120 injured in airstrikes by Syrian government forces on the northern city of Raqqa, a stronghold for the extremist group ISIS, a monitoring group said Wednesday. The death toll from Tuesday's airstrikes is expected to rise because many people are critically injured, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Government warplanes carried out at least 10 airstrikes in Raqqa, targeting the city's al-Hani Mosque and the public souk, or market, the Observatory said. Its reports are based on information from a network of activists and residents on the ground in Syria. Syria's state TV and news agency SANA have not reported on military operations targeting Raqqa. The U.S.-led coalition against ISIS has also carried out airstrikes in the area since the start of operations in September. The extremists have made the city, which sits on the banks of the Euphrates River, the de facto capital of their self-declared ""Islamic State"" that stretches across large areas of Syria and Iraq. The city is known as a place where ISIS puts training centers, weapons depots and accommodations for fighters. During the Syrian conflict, the group has also seized military bases from the Syrian regime near the city and in the wider Raqqa province. U.S. Central Command said the coalition carried out 10 airstrikes in Syria from Monday to Wednesday, hitting ISIS targets near the Syrian Kurdish city of Kobani. Report: ISIS commander in Iraq killed . Across the border in northern Iraq, tens of ISIS militants were killed after they attacked Mosul Dam on Wednesday from three directions, a spokesman for Kurdish Peshmerga forces at the dam told CNN. The assault ended after coalition aircraft targeted ISIS convoys, he said. Six Peshmerga fighters were injured. A U.S.-led coalition airstrike killed a senior ISIS figure near the city of Hit along with dozens of others riding in a convoy of vehicles Tuesday, Sabah Karkhout, the head of Iraq's Anbar provincial council, told CNN. Senan Meteeb, named by ISIS as the ""emir"" or ""prince"" of the group's military in the area in western Anbar province, was reportedly killed along with 30 other ISIS militants when the convoy was hit about 190 kilometers (118 miles) northwest of Baghdad. Meteeb was directly responsible for operations that led to the recent killing of hundreds of Albu Nimr Sunni tribesmen who fought against ISIS side-by-side with Iraqi security forces in Anbar province and Hit, Karkhout said. Sheikh Naim al-Gaoud, one of the leaders of the Albu Nimr tribe, confirmed to CNN that Meteeb was a top-ranking ISIS leader in the Hit area, but he said he had no confirmation from his men on the ground that he had been killed. If true, he said, Meteeb would be a high-value target. Hit and neighboring Ramadi were holdouts in the Sunni-dominated Anbar province after ISIS swept in from Syria, taking town after town in the western province. Albu Nimr tribesmen were among those who fought them until they began running of out weapons and supplies. U.S. Central Command said the coalition had carried out seven airstrikes in Iraq from Monday to Wednesday but listed none on a convoy in the Hit area. The closest was an airstrike northwest of Ramadi that damaged an ISIS checkpoint. Two airstrikes near Mosul destroyed an ISIS fighting position, buildings and vehicles, and also struck a large ISIS unit, Central Command said. Two more airstrikes near the northern city of Kirkuk and one in the Sinjar area, also in the north, took out ISIS vehicles, it said. Another west of Baiji destroyed an ISIS vehicle and damaged another.","U.S. Central Command: 10 coalition airstrikes in Syria, seven in Iraq since Monday .

"The Hong Kong teenager who has become the face of pro-democracy protests in the city ended his hunger strike on Saturday for health reasons. Joshua Wong started the hunger strike on Monday, December 1, telling CNN it was the ""only way"" to get the government to agree to talks. A statement on his Facebook page said that the strike lasted for 108 hours and he ended it on the advice of his doctor.  He said he felt ""extremely unwell"" and his blood sugar was very low. The 18-year-old activist, who leads a student group called Scholarism, wants open elections for Hong Kong's next leader, but Beijing has said Hong Kong may only hold elections if candidates are nominated by a small committee. Wong's hunger strike was seen as an attempt to rally a movement which has shown growing signs of fracture. Protesters have camped more than two months on an eight-lane highway in Hong Kong's Admiralty district, but the government has shown no willingness to make concessions. The movement's momentum has sputtered and leaders of different protest groups are split over what action to take.","Hong Kong teenage protest leader ends hunger strike .

"""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" is not a very good movie. Actually, it's less of a movie than a horrific catalogue of everything that is miserable and boring in modern Hollywood: The urge to sequelize into infinity, the paycheck-gravitas of great British actors, the redefinition of ""plot"" as ""a series of digitalized set-pieces signifying nothing,"" the notion of Shia LaBeouf as an action hero, the notion that Russians still make interesting villains, the limits of Cate Blanchett's greatness, but, most of all, the TV-ification of movie stardom, whereby every movie star is only really a star when they're sleepwalking through reheated incarnations of their most iconic roles. (See also: Renée Zellweger, Sylvester Stallone, everyone who has ever starred in a superhero movie besides Christian Bale, the cast of ""Fast Five,"" the cast of ""Twilight."") But ""Crystal Skull"" was directed by Steven Spielberg, who has almost certainly earned the right to strike out every now and then. Spielberg has been producing great, complex, entertaining Hollywood fare for 40 years now. You don't just pick out your favorite Spielberg film; you pick out your favorite Spielberg phase. Do you prefer the ""Classic"" era, from 1975 (""Jaws"") to 1982 (""E.T."")? Or perhaps the underrated ""Weird"" period, from 1984 (""Temple of Doom"") to 1991 (""Hook""), which also includes Spielberg's work as the producer of ""Gremlins,"" ""The Goonies,"" and ""Back to the Future""? Some people dig the ""Revival"" period, when he made the ""important"" trilogy (""Schindler's List,"" ""Amistad,"" ""Saving Private Ryan"") and mixed in a couple ""Jurassic Park"" movies, why not? Personally, I dig Spielberg's ""Bleak"" period, from 2001′s totally weird Kubrick mash-up ""A.I."" through a brilliant post-9/11 Tom Cruise duet up to the incisive thriller ""Munich."" That's a great run that ended with ""Crystal Skull,"" but in a new interview with Empire, Spielberg sounds pretty serene about the ""Indiana Jones"" fourquel. That's not to say he doesn't understand that people have a gripe with the central plot point of the film, which you'll recall forced Harrison Ford to run around the jungle waving a Crystal Skull and yelling ""Crystal Skull! Crystal Skull! Crystal Skull!"" for 90 minutes. ""I sympathize with people who didn't like the MacGuffin because I never liked the MacGuffin,"" says Spielberg. ""George [Lucas] and I had big arguments about the MacGuffin."" Ah, but don't think for a moment that Spielberg is joining in the popular Internet sporting event of Hating On Lucas. ""I am loyal to my best friend,"" he says. ""When he writes a story he believes in -- even if I don't believe in it -- I'm going to shoot the movie the way George envisaged it."" So basically, this is a classic example of an awesome filmmaker deferring to a decidedly less awesome filmmaker, purely out of friendship. (Sort of like whenever Quentin Tarantino works with Robert Rodriguez, or when Alfred Hitchcock took some peyote with William Wyler and Wyler was all like, ""Yo Hitch, man, you should totally make a movie about dreams, man!"" and the result was Spellbound.) Spielberg happily admits that the most infamous scene in Crystal Skull belongs to him: . ""What people really jumped at was Indy climbing into a refrigerator and getting blown into the sky by an atom-bomb blast. Blame me. Don't blame George. That was my silly idea. People stopped saying 'jump the shark.' They now say, 'nuked the fridge.' I'm proud of that. I'm glad I was able to bring that into popular culture."" Anyhow, the point is that Spielberg feels your pain, and now we can all have a good laugh, and while we're laughing, we can take a good hard look the first decade of the new millennium, and ponder the fact that we lived through a moment when George Lucas' silly ideas were regularly turned into $200 million movies.

"Republican Sen. John McCain broke with members of his party Tuesday, lauding the release of the Senate Intelligence Committee's report on torture and decrying the use of torture as having ""stained our national honor"" and doing ""much harm and little practical good."" McCain, a survivor of torture himself from his naval service during the Vietnam War, said from the Senate floor that the techniques outlined in the report ""not only failed their purpose -- to secure actionable intelligence to prevent further attacks on the U.S. and our allies -- but actually damaged our security interests, as well as our reputation as a force for good in the world."" Many Republicans have argued against releasing the report, especially as the threat of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria grows, and U.S. intelligence officials have warned that its release could cause backlash from nations and groups hostile towards the nation. American embassies in the Middle East have been put on heightened security alert for its release. McCain said that while ""the truth is a hard pill to swallow ... the American people are entitled to it."" And he acknowledged that violence against the U.S. from the ""Muslim world"" is ""possible ... perhaps likely"" but argued that America's enemies ""hardly need an excuse"" to attack the nation, so the good done by the release of the report should trump any security concerns. ""This report strengthens self-government and, ultimately, I believe, America's security and stature in the world,"" he said. During his comments, McCain referenced his own experience with torture and argued that it ""produces more misleading information than actionable intelligence"" and that ""we can and we will"" win the war on terrorism without such techniques. But he argued that the U.S. shouldn't resort to such tactics not just because they're ineffective and potentially dangerous but because they undermine the nation's values and beliefs. ""I have often said, and will always maintain, that this question isn't about our enemies; it's about us. It's about who we were, who we are and who we aspire to be. It's about how we represent ourselves to the world,"" he said. McCain added, ""When we fight to defend our securit,y we fight also for an idea ... that all men are endowed by the Creator with inalienable rights."" ""Our enemies act without conscience. We must not,"" he added.","John McCain spoke shortly after the Senate released its report on torture .

"Ronan Farrow has reopened a can of worms Woody Allen probably would have just as soon kept sealed. In addition to a speech by Diane Keaton, a frequent Allen co-star, a Golden Globes tribute Sunday night featured a short film of Allen's greatest hits. But the film was missing one thing, tweeted Farrow. ""Missed the Woody Allen tribute,"" he wrote, ""did they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after Annie Hall?"" Ronan Farrow disses Woody Allen's Golden Globes tribute . (Allen wasn't at the Globes; he's known for avoiding awards shows, for many years skipping the Oscars to keep a regular musical gig at a New York jazz club.) The tweet once again exposes one of the darkest episodes of Allen's life -- one that had seemingly vanished from the headlines in recent years, as the filmmaker's career has been revitalized by a series of well-reviewed, award-winning films, including ""Match Point"" and ""Midnight in Paris."" In 1992, in the wake of an affair between Allen and Soon-Yi Previn -- Farrow's adopted daughter with composer Andre Previn -- the filmmaker was accused by Farrow of molesting their young daughter Dylan. A court found the accusations inconclusive, but the scandal permanently damaged Allen's image -- that of a neurotic, but amusing schlub with a talent for slapstick and witty one-liners. Legacy of a scandal . Indeed, until the scandal hit, Allen was generally received warmly by the general public, even if his New York-centric, sometimes thorny comedies appealed only to a fairly narrow audience. (As a seemingly autobiographical line in 1980's ""Stardust Memories"" pointed out, the public tended to like his ""earlier, funnier movies."") He was easily caricatured -- not least by himself, since he always maintained his screen persona was just that, a persona -- and was even the subject of a comic strip for several years. Allen responded to the scandal by denying the Dylan accusations and saying that his relationship with Mia Farrow, which had been painted in storybook colors by the press, was not actually all that strong. As usual, he immersed himself in his work, maintaining his movie-per-year schedule and generally avoiding the limelight. Some of his mid-'90s movies, notably ""Deconstructing Harry"" and ""Celebrity,"" were unpleasantly acidic views of public life. He did marry Soon-Yi Previn in 1997, and after the marriage came a slightly more public Woody Allen. The couple was the focus of a 1997 Barbara Kopple documentary, ""Wild Man Blues,"" which portrayed a generally happy pair. Allen was also the subject of a 2011 Robert Weide film, ""Woody Allen: A Documentary,"" which briskly addressed Farrow's allegations from Allen's point of view. However, the scandal has always been near the surface, and this is the second time in recent months that it's made a forthright appearance. In a November Vanity Fair article, Allen was condemned by Mia Farrow's children, especially Dylan, who has since changed her name. ""I'm scared of him, his image,"" Dylan told writer Maureen Orth. Another child, Fletcher Previn, told Orth he had removed Allen's image from both family photos and videos. Ronan Farrow's point . And Sunday's tweet isn't the first time Ronan Farrow has aimed a poison pixel at Allen. ""Happy father's day -- or as they call it in my family, happy brother-in-law's day,"" he tweeted last June, referring to the Soon-Yi affair. But publicist Howard Bragman, vice-chair of Reputation.com, doesn't think Allen will be hurt. ""I don't think we can expect a lot of traction on this thing,"" he said. ""If this was a guy who was spending a lot of time getting press for himself, it might bite him in the ass. But he's not investing his time in (publicity) -- he's a filmmaker."" Ronan Farrow also comes out ahead. He recently signed a deal with MSNBC for a talk show, so the publicity will keep his name in the headlines, said Bragman. ""He's clearly his mother's son -- she's made her point of view known on this -- and he's also got a new forum in terms of a TV show, so this does him good in terms of attention,"" he said. Allen generally doesn't comment to the press, but in a 1992 ""60 Minutes"" interview, he said that allegations he abused Dylan were ""insane."" Woody Allen's lawyer Elkan Abramowitz said in the November Vanity Fair article that Allen still denies the allegations. An e-mail to Woody Allen's representative requesting comment on recent events wasn't immediately returned on Monday. A forgiving town . Hollywood is a forgiving town -- even for a defiantly un-Hollywood type like Woody Allen. Roman Polanski, who fled to Europe in 1977 after pleading guilty to unlawful sex with a minor, won a best director Oscar for 2002's ""The Pianist."" In 1951, producer Walter Wanger shot and wounded his wife's agent, believing an affair was going on; he served four months and went back to producing, including ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers."" Countless other stars have engaged in sordid behavior and paid no price worse than public disapproval. For their supporters, it's the art, not the artist. ""It's a complicated question, made even more so by the idiosyncratic relationship between each artist's body of work and personality,"" wrote Amanda Marcotte in Slate. Allen has maintained the art wins out. ""All the success over it or the rejection, none of that really matters because in the end, the thing will survive or not survive on its merits,"" said Keaton in her speech, quoting Allen. Still, for Allen, known for his jokes and aphorisms -- ""I don't want to achieve immortality through my work. I want to achieve it through not dying,"" goes one of the best known -- it's perhaps ironic that one particular quotation attached to the scandal may end up the squirmy centerpiece of his biography. Interviewed by Time magazine in 1992 about the Soon-Yi affair, he leaned (perhaps unawares) on an Emily Dickinson line. ""The heart,"" he said, ""wants what it wants."" But even more striking, given the filmmaker's lack of concern for public opinion, is the original line, which is taken from an 1862 Dickinson letter. ""The heart wants what it wants,"" Dickinson wrote. ""Or else it does not care.""","Ronan Farrow tweet during Golden Globes brings up Woody Allen scandal .

"School meals will have to offer fruits and vegetables to students every day under standards issued by the United States Department of Agriculture on Wednesday. The meal programs, which feed about 32 million students in public and private schools, will have to reduce sodium, saturated fat and trans fats. Schools must also offer more whole grains as well as fat-free or low-fat milk varieties. These standards go into effect July 1 and will be phased in over a three-year period, according to the USDA. The new nutrition standards are largely based on recommendations by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, as part of efforts to curb childhood obesity. Recent numbers show that about 17% of children in the United States are obese. Under the new rules, school meals will have calorie minimums and maximums per meal based on the child's age. For kindergarteners to fifth-graders, meals must contain 550 to 650 calories, and for 9th- to 12th-graders, meals must have 450 to 600 calories. Children will not be forced to take the vegetables and fruits onto their plates; the standards require that the various food groups be offered. Health groups reacted to the rules mostly favorably, although a controversy erupted in November after Congress decided that two tablespoons of tomato sauce was good enough to categorize a slice of pizza as a vegetable. Kevin Concannon, the USDA under secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, said he wasn't concerned with the tomato paste controversy at this point. ""I'm confident we have a core healthy set of proposed diets for children,"" he said. ""We can, within that, accommodate those recommendations received from Congress."" Food and beverages sold in vending machines will also have to meet nutritional standards. First lady Michelle Obama and USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack unveiled the standards Wednesday. ""When we send our kids to school, we expect that they won't be eating the kind of fatty, salty, sugary foods that we try to keep them from eating at home,"" Obama said in a news release. ""We want the food they get at school to be the same kind of food we would serve at our own kitchen tables."" The USDA offered a weekly sample lunch menu with before and after comparisons. Before the new rules, a standard elementary school lunch menu might consist of cheese pizza, canned pineapple, tater tots and chocolate milk.  A healthier meal under the new standards would have whole-wheat cheese pizza, baked sweet potato fries, raw grape tomatoes, low-fat ranch dip, applesauce and low-fat milk. Some parts of the major revamp of school lunches have been rejected by students.  The Los Angeles Times reported in December that students trashed the untouched healthier meals and started a booming underground market for junk food. Cafeteria workers in Chicago Public Schools reported that kids were not eating the healthy meals, according to the Chicago Tribune. ""If it's not delicious, kids aren't going to eat it,"" said Sam Kass, assistant White House chef.  ""I have lots of confidence in school chefs across the country who are working very hard to try to put delicious foods on the plates of kids."" He cited a Chefs Move to Schools Program, involving 35,000 school chefs who strive to innovate for better-tasting, healthy meals for kids. The new standards are expected to cost $3.2 billion over the next five years, which was less than the initial estimated price, according to the USDA. The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 gave the federal government more authority to set standards for food sold in vending machines and elsewhere on school grounds. ""The new school meal standards are one of the most important advances in nutrition in decades,"" said Margo Wootan, nutrition policy director at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. ""They're much needed, given high childhood obesity rates and the poor state of our children's diets."" The School Nutrition Association, which represents 55,000 school nutrition professionals, said, ""Through healthier choices and nutrition education, school meal programs have made tremendous strides to promote better food choices for America's students.  These national nutrition standards will help school nutrition professionals build on their successes.""","School meals will have to offer fruits and vegetables to students every day .

"Six months ago, the story began as a puzzling news bulletin. A Malaysia Airlines passenger jet with 239 people on board had vanished from radar screens as it was flying from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The disappearance was quite the mystery. Was it a terrorist attack? Was there a mechanical failure that led to a crash? Did the plane go down over land or water? Were there any survivors? We all figured the answers would come after searchers found the aircraft or its wreckage. Half a year later, it remains a deep mystery. No part of the plane has been discovered. Not one speck of debris. A Boeing 777-200ER just disappeared. With 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board, it just vanished. Authorities are convinced the plane crashed March 8 in the southern Indian Ocean. Satellite data and radar information indicate the plane turned off course and most likely went down about the time it would have run out of fuel. Officials don't know why it flew off course. Looking for debris yielded nothing but garbage . Airplanes and ships searched the surface of the ocean for nearly two months, with each report of debris turning out to be a false lead or flotsam from another source. To date, more than 4.5 million square kilometers of sea have been scoured. An underwater drone with sonar took the search beneath the waves in mid-April and looked for the source of four underwater pings picked up by devices towed by ships. The pulses were encouraging because they were of a frequency close to that used by the locator beacons on the plane. The four signals were within 30 kilometers of one another. More days of searching followed. Dozens of underwater missions over hundreds of kilometers. Still nothing. Heartbroken family members of the people on board the plane have been left still seeking answers. Deciphering the noise . Recently, Australian researchers said they had recovered another underwater sound recorder that was in the ocean when MH370 vanished. They found a signal similar to one they noticed on recordings from other devices pulled from the water. It could be a noise made by the plane crashing. As with many possible clues in this strange case, there is a big but. The researchers at Curtin University believe the sound or sounds came from an area thousands of kilometers to the northwest of the search area. The signal seems to have originated close to the tip of India, near a geologically active ridge -- meaning the recordings are most likely those of a seismic event. Experts poring over data . The latest clue comes from a failed satellite phone call from the airline's staff on the morning the plane disappeared. Subsequent analysis of the failed call has given experts a better idea of the aircraft's position and where it was traveling, Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said August 28. And that data indicates the missing passenger jet may have turned south slightly earlier than previously thought. The next phase of the search for the remains of the plane and the people on board is primarily focused on a 60,000-square-kilometer area, roughly the size of West Virginia, in the southern Indian Ocean. Forbidding undersea terrain . A deepwater search that will involve three ships is expected to start in the area in late September, using a range of sophisticated sonar equipment. The process is forecast to take as long as a year and cost $48 million, officials have said. Ships have already been mapping the undersea terrain in the isolated swath of ocean to help the searchers. Much of the geography of the area was previously unknown before MH370's disappearance drew attention there. And some of it will be very, very difficult to search, with the mapping survey showing undersea volcanoes and steep ridges. The latest analysis of the data indicates that southern areas of the huge search grid may be of high interest, Australian officials have said, suggesting that the zone is likely to be further adjusted. Job cuts at airline . The loss of MH370 and the shoot-down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine in July have contributed to 6,000 people at the airline losing their jobs because of heavy financial losses. The carrier reported in late August that it lost $97.4 million in the second quarter. Malaysia Airlines was once a symbol of national pride. But the airline was in big financial trouble before the twin disasters of Flight 370 and Flight 17 claimed the lives of 537 people. Australia: MH370 may have turned south earlier than previously thought . Hard areas found in search zone unlikely to be man-made .","On March 8, MH370 veered off course and vanished from radar en route to Beijing .

"(CNN)California health officials said Wednesday there are 79 confirmed measles cases in the state, as federal health authorities reported that the number of U.S. cases in 2014 more than tripled any total in recent years. According to the California Department of Public Health website, 52 of those cases are linked to an outbreak at Disneyland. There are four confirmed cases in Riverside County, where the Desert Sands Unified School District told 66 students -- who have either not been vaccinated for measles or can't show proof --  that they need to stay home. CNN affiliate KESQ reported that one student at Palm Desert High School is suspected of having had measles. The student has been cleared to return to class but health officials are still trying to determine if the student actually had measles. For now, the others will have to study at their homes. ""They are going to be asked to stay home until the incubation period for contagion is complete,"" a spokeswoman for the school district, Mary Perry, said of the students who were released. The earliest a student can return without proof of vaccination is February 9, the station reported. Of the 79 California cases, 15 are in Los Angeles County, and all victims were unvaccinated for measles, said Dr. Jeffrey Gunzenhauser, the county's interim health officer. Of those 15 county cases, 14 are linked to Disneyland, Gunzenhauser said. ""In L.A. County, we're, fortunately, highly vaccinated. Five percent or less are unvaccinated,"" Gunzenhauser said. There are 16 cases linked to Disneyland outside California (seven in Arizona, three in Utah, two in Washington, one in Colorado, one in Oregon, one in Nebraska and one in Mexico). Arizona officials said they have identified 1,000 contacts of the seven cases in their states. They're asking anyone within that group to isolate themselves for 21 days if he or she isn't vaccinated. The disease outbreak became apparent when visitors reported coming down with measles after visiting the park from December 15 to December 20.

Also, the families of 195 children in Mesa, Arizona, have been contacted because they were in an urgent care clinic with someone who has measles. Midway across the country, at the University of Minnesota, a student who had traveled abroad is self-isolating after contracting the disease, the school said in a statement. The university is working to find everyone who may have been exposed to the student, who attended class four days last week. Though students have largely been immunized because of enrollment requirements, the university warned anyone who had not been vaccinated to be vigilant. Minnesota is one of 27 states that reported measles cases last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The 644 cases reported in 2014 mark a stark spike compared with recent years. Since 2001, the number of cases has topped 100 only five times, and 2011 was the only year in which cases topped 200.

"Google's first female engineer, Marissa Mayer, has made a career out of bucking expectations -- and she did so once again on Monday by announcing she will leave Google to be the new CEO of Yahoo, the struggling company that once was Google's main competitor. Know Yahoo's Marissa Meyer in 11 facts . The tech world reacted with shock to the news. But it's perhaps time everyone got used to the idea that Mayer, who was Google's 20th employee and who is credited with the success of many of its most famous products, isn't the kind of person who does only what people expect her to do. ""There is such a stereotype of the hacker -- the pasty-skinned guy with the thick glasses, the pocket protector, the blue glow coming off of the monitor ... people think if they're going to be good at this, that's what they need to be,"" Mayer told CNN in an interview earlier this year. ""You can be good at technology and like fashion and art. You can be good at technology and be a jock. You can be good at technology and be a mom. You can do it your way, on your terms."" Mayer, sometimes referred to as the ""Googirl,"" certainly has charted her own course, often weaving seemingly disparate worlds and interests together. Raised in Wausau, Wisconsin, the 37-year-old joined Google in 1999 when it was a fledgling start-up, not an Internet titan. She danced in ""The Nutcracker"" ballet at Stanford and earned a degree in computer science. She espouses a love for cupcakes -- but, according to interviews with other news organizations, once created a spreadsheet to determine the perfect recipe. At Google, Mayer was responsible for overseeing the launch of some of the company's most iconic products, including Gmail, Google Maps and iGoogle. Fortune: New Yahoo CEO Mayer is pregnant . But it was her keen design aesthetic that in part led to her success at Google, which she helped grow into one of the biggest tech and Internet companies on the planet. Mayer's most enduring legacy at Google may prove to be the company's search engine homepage, with its minimalist feel, ample white space and bright blue, red, yellow and green colors. She is credited with pushing for that clean, approachable look -- which seems to be a reflection of her style outside the office, too. ""An engineer at heart, she also had something that many of her peers did not during Google's early days: a keen sense of style and design,"" the New York Times wrote in a 2009 profile. ""She adored bold blocks of color against a white background, much like the Marimekko prints that once hung in her childhood home. ... Her San Francisco penthouse has a similar, but more expensive, aesthetic. It is painted in neutral shades and decorated with fanciful, multihued glass artwork by Dale Chihuly."" Open letter to Marissa Mayer . Mayer told the paper that people who come to her penthouse sometimes are confused, saying: ""Does your apartment look like Google or does Google look like your apartment?'"" Along with executive chairman Eric Schmidt, Mayer has been one of Google's most visible public faces for the past decade. A frequent speaker at tech conferences, she has lent a dash of glamour to the jeans-and-hoodie world of many young tech engineers. As one of a relatively small number of women in high-ranking positions in tech -- Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman are two others -- Mayer often is asked about what she thinks about the role of women in her field. ""I actually think it's the wrong question,"" she told Newsweek/The Daily Beast in an interview in May. ""It's a question that hangs us up and causes the progress to be slower. The truth is we're not producing enough computer scientists, period."" Passion, she says, is what really matters. Not gender. Facebook COO leaves work at 5:30 to spend time with her kids . ""I'm not a woman at Google, I'm a geek at Google,"" she told CNN in April. ""If you can find something that you're really passionate about, whether you're a man or a woman comes a lot less into play. Passion is a gender-neutralizing force."" Mayer will need plenty of passion if she is to help right the ship at Yahoo, a struggling company that has seen its recent CEOs pass through the company in quick succession. Many think she is the right person for that job. ""Marissa Mayer is one of a few people who has enough gravitas to ignore public markets for a while and do what's long-term best for Yahoo,"" Chris Dixon, a prominent Silicon Valley investor, wrote on Twitter shortly after the news was announced. Marc Andreessen, another prominent venture capitalist, reportedly praised the move, saying Mayer will be a product-minded CEO. Forbes said the Yahoo job puts Mayer ""in the running for the title of the most powerful woman in tech."" And the blog ReadWriteWeb said she is ""just what Yahoo needs."" ""This is a great move for Yahoo, which has stewed in mediocrity for years,"" wrote ReadWriteWeb's Dan Frommer. ""Mayer, a big shot in Silicon Valley and a perfectionist product-type executive, could legitimately make Yahoo respectable again. At the very least, she will command attention.""

"The 2013 fertilizer plant blast that killed 15 people and wounded another 226 in West, Texas, ""should never have occurred,"" the chairman of the U.S. Chemical Safety Board said Tuesday. Though the board's report says that at least 14 people were killed, the death toll was updated to 15 people in the days after the blast. The board's investigation, released a few days after the first anniversary of the explosion, indicates the incident was ""preventable,"" Chairman Rafael Moure-Eraso said. The statement from his agency, which was given Tuesday to reporters, blamed the company that owned the fertilizer plant, government regulators and other authorities for the incident. ""It resulted from the failure of a company to take the necessary steps to avert a preventable fire and explosion and from the inability of federal, state and local regulatory agencies to identify a serious hazard and correct it,"" Moure-Eraso said. McLennan County, for example, didn't have an emergency response plan in place, and ""the community clearly was not aware of the potential hazard at West Fertilizer,"" the report said. A lack of fire codes was repeatedly cited in the report, with investigators noting Texas didn't have a fire code and small counties are prohibited from having them. But, the chairman said, local fire departments need fire codes to ""hold industrial operators accountable for safe storage and handling of chemicals."" Texas town tighter than ever one year later . The board's supervisory investigator, Johnnie Banks, said all levels of government also failed to adopt codes to keep populated areas away from hazardous facilities. This is not unique to West, Banks said. ""We found 1,351 facilities across the country that store ammonium nitrate,"" he said, adding that farm communities are just beginning to collect information on the proximity of homes and schools to ammonium nitrate storage facilities. The investigation determined that ""lessons learned"" from responses to similar incidents were not disseminated to firefighters, 11 of whom died when the West plant exploded. The probe said guidelines from the National Fire Protection Association and U.S. Department of Transportation recommend that firefighters evacuate the area surrounding ""massive"" ammonium nitrate fires and that the area be doused with water ""from a distance."" However, the report said, the guidance is vague because of the use of subjective words like ""massive,"" ""large"" and ""distance."" ""All of these provisions should be reviewed and harmonized in light of the West disaster to ensure that firefighters are adequately protected and are not put into danger protecting property alone,"" Banks said. U.S. guidelines for ammonium nitrate storage have been static for decades, the board said, but the United Kingdom in 1996 mandated that storage facilities be one story, well-ventilated and constructed of concrete, brick or steel. Moure-Eraso lauded the Fertilizer Institute for recently establishing guidelines for the storage and transportation of ammonium nitrate, along with recommendations for first responders in the event of a fire. He further called on all states and counties to likewise update their guidelines. ""The state of Texas, McLennan County, (the Occupational Safety and Health Administration) and the (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency) have work to do because this hazard exists in hundreds of locations across the U.S.,"" Moure-Eraso wrote. ""However, it is important to note that there is no substitute for an efficient regulatory system that ensures that all companies are operating to the same high standards. We cannot depend on voluntary compliance."" Though the Chemical Safety Board investigates serious chemical accidents and makes safety recommendations, it does not issue fines or citations. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the state fire marshal's office said last week that their investigation into the cause of the fire remains active. West's mayor, Tommy Muska, told CNN last week that doing more policywise, like instituting a statewide fire code, ""would have been a wonderful thing."" ""You don't want to overregulate,"" Muska said. ""But you also have to look at what (could) make us safer."" Rep. Joe C. Pickett, chairman of the Homeland Security and Public Safety committee in the state House of Representatives, said local authorities should go beyond having every place subject to a fire code. The Democrat from El Paso is pushing to give the state fire marshal's office more authority, particularly over unincorporated areas, where about 60 of the over 100 facilities storing ammonium nitrate, like what exploded at West Fertilizer, are located. Unlike those falling within city or county limits, these facilities don't have to have things like sprinklers or other safety measures. Other steps would include getting the word out about places that store ammonium nitrate and other potentially explosive materials. ""We don't want this to happen again,"" said Pickett, noting that state authorities took some immediate actions and that other, more deliberate ones are in the works. ""There have got to be some changes ... But I don't want to rush and do the wrong thing.""

"The father of one of the two Indonesian women whose bodies were found in an upscale Hong Kong apartment at the weekend has called for his daughter's killer to be executed. Police discovered the decomposing body of Sumarti Ningsih, 25, on Saturday stuffed in a suitcase on the balcony of a 31st-floor apartment in Wan Chai, a popular Hong Kong nightlife district. Another woman, Seneng Mujiasih, 29, was found on the floor of the apartment with her throat slashed. Sumarti's father, Ahmad Khaliman, says his daughter's killer deserves to die. ""I demand that he gets the death penalty,"" Khaliman told CNN affiliate Trans7 on Tuesday. ""If not, I cannot accept it. He has already taken my daughter's life, so he has to pay with his life."" But his demand will almost certainly go unfulfilled; Hong Kong abolished capital punishment more than two decades ago. Rurik Jutting, a 29-year-old British investment banker who lived in the apartment, has been charged with two counts of murder over the killings of the two women. He declined to enter a plea to the charges in a court appearance Monday. Father 'very shocked' In documents submitted to the court, police say they believe Sumarti was killed on October 27, five days before her body was found. Mujiasih is thought to have been killed on Saturday, the same day that police say Jutting called them to the apartment. The Indonesian Consulate in Hong Kong said Sumarti may have entered Hong Kong on October 4 and had permission to stay there until Monday. She was from the Indonesian city of Cilacap, where her father and other family members are mourning her shocking death. Khaliman held two framed photos his daughter as he talked to Trans7 in the family's yellow bungalow in Cilacap. He told the news agency Agence France-Presse that one of Sumarti's acquaintances in Hong Kong told the family what had happened. ""We were informed by telephone that our daughter was murdered,"" AFP quoted him as saying. ""I was very shocked, especially when I was informed that it was hard to identify the body."" Families want remains repatriated . Khaliman told AFP that Sumarti had first gone to Hong Kong in 2011 to work as a domestic helper and then returned to Indonesia in 2013. She went back to Hong Kong on two occasions after that, he said. The families of both victims have requested that the remains of the two women be returned to Indonesia for burial, Michael Tene, a spokesman for the country's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday. Indonesian authorities are working on repatriating the remains as soon as possible, he said, cautioning that it would take time. ""I want her to be buried in Indonesia,"" Khaliman told AFP. Jutting, who recently left his job with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, remains in custody until his next court appearance on November 10.","""He has already taken my daughter's life, so he has to pay with his life,"" father says .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN)At least seven civilians died after shells slammed into a transit stop Thursday in the volatile eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk, the latest notable attack in a months-long conflict that has seen plenty of bloodshed, blame-sharing and intermittent negotiations but few signs of easing. The fatalities are among at least 10 civilians killed total, in addition to 20 injured, in the shelling of four city districts in the past 24 hours, the Donetsk City Council said on its website. Ukraine's state-run Ukrinform news, citing the Donetsk government, reported eight dead and seven hospitalized in the bus stop attack alone. Donetsk has been a stronghold for separatists, who have been battling government forces for control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions since the spring. ""As of now, the situation remains difficult,"" the city council said. And as has been the case with many incidents in the conflict, there was no universally accepted explanation of what happened or who was responsible. Russia's Foreign Ministry demanded an investigation and criticized Ukraine for its shelling of Ukrainian cities like Donetsk, which are controlled or at least full of pro-Russian separatists. Yet Ukraine's Defense Ministry blamed the rebels for the attack, saying it was launched from areas they control. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has a monitoring mission in Ukraine, is among those trying to get to the bottom of it all. Its deputy chief monitor, Alexander Hug, told reporters that an OCSE patrol saw seven bodies near a vehicle that had been hit. And it's not the only instance of violence in the area. ""Terrorists using multiple launch missile systems precisely destroy(ed) houses"" in the Donetsk region cities of Debaltseve and Avdiyivka, Ukrinform reported, citing Donetsk regional police Chief Vyacheslav Abroskin. Rebels captured 16 wounded Ukrainian soldiers after fighting at Donetsk's airport, Kiev's military said, according to Ukrinform. Negotiations are underway to secure their release. And the OSCE, in an update posted Wednesday, cited numerous instances of shelling in recent days, with two hospitals in separatist-held territory among the buildings affected. As U.S. Gen. Philip Breedlove, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, pointed out Thursday: ""Violence has intensified and changed character in Ukraine."" As has been true so often in recent months, the violence is happening around the same time as negotiations aimed at stopping it. The latest talks happened Wednesday in Berlin and included the foreign ministers of Ukraine and Russia, as well as Germany and France. Their official aim was to resolve the crisis by hammering out how to implement a peace deal that was agreed upon last year. After Wednesday's talks, the four foreign ministers condemned the continuing violence and called for the peace deal that was reached in Minsk, Belarus, last September to be respected. Fighting in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions ""has severely escalated causing the loss of many human lives including civilians. This must stop immediately and the regime of quiet must be restored,"" the ministers said. They said ""tangible progress"" must be made on full implementation of the Minsk pact ahead of a planned peace summit. The attack on the Donetsk trolley bus station obviously doesn't help the situation. Russia's foreign ministry called it a ""a crime against humanity (and) a great provocation aimed to undermine the efforts for the peaceful settlement of the crisis."" The unrest began in late 2013, leading up to Parliament's ouster last February of pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych. Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula a few weeks later, with fighting breaking out in April in two Ukrainian regions bordering Russia -- Donetsk and Luhansk. Separatist leaders there declared independence from Ukraine and sided with Russia. But how much was, and is, Moscow involved in their campaign? Ukraine's divide: Two sides of a river . It depends who you ask. Officials in Moscow have expressed sympathy for the separatists, but denied any outright military support. However, Ukraine and its allies have accused Russia of fomenting the rebellion by actively backing it. ""It is clear that Russia has to stop supporting the separatists and respect international law,"" said Danish Gen. Knud Bartels -- chairman of the military committee for NATO, which doesn't include Ukraine but is working to further its ""military-to-military cooperation"" with Kiev. On Wednesday, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko reasserted a claim that Russia sent troops across the border to support the rebels. ""We have more than 9,000 Russian troops who -- so-called -- lost the way, crossing our Russian-Ukrainian border, bring with them hundreds and hundreds of tanks, armed personnel carriers, and killing Ukrainian civilians and attacking Ukrainian troops,"" Poroshenko told CNN. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, speaking in Moscow before the Berlin talks, responded to Ukraine's assertion with a firm denial -- much like other denials made by Russian officials in recent months over similar allegations of armed intervention. ""As to the flow of troops and armaments, this is not the first time we hear something like that,"" he said. ""And each time I hear that I say, if you're so confident about that, please present us with facts, but no one has been able to provide us with these facts."" Journalist Victoria Butenko reported from Kiev. CNN's Alla Eschenko, Christine Theodorou, Khushbu Shah and Stefan Simons contributed to this report.","State news: Rebels capture 16 wounded Ukrainian soldiers at Donetsk's airport .

"Hong Kong (CNN)""We'll be back"" banners and posters proclaimed on the 75th and final day of the pro-democracy protests that have upended Hong Kong. Whether that's a threat or a wan hope depends on who you ask right now. The students that formed the ""Umbrella Movement"" -- named for the humble umbrella used to protect against tear gas and pepper spray -- are morose but defiant, and more alienated than ever. Pro-government supporters have transformed from being rather passionless parrots of the Beijing line into fire-breathing zealots demanding Hong Kong police bash the heads of anyone stepping into the streets. Emotions are clearly raw, and probably will continue to be into 2015. The ""Occupy Central"" protests make the upcoming annual policy address by the city's leader, Chief Executive C.Y. Leung, in mid January the most critical since Hong Kong reunified with China in 1997. Continuing to stand firm and largely ignore protesters won't fix the sources of so much ""turmoil"" -- a term associated with the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre and controversially used in the South China Morning Post's headline on Occupy Central's ending. The governments in Hong Kong and Beijing must demonstrate clear understanding of what drove so many to protest so long. Unless the diagnosis is correct, prescriptions of ""medicines"" will do more harm than good. PHOTOS: Hong Kong protesters bid camp farewell . Demand to be heard . Demands for democracy are in reality demands to be heard. Leung must show he listens to everyone, that he cares, and that he will take action—decisive, but fair action. And that's the rub. Research shows one crucial value—belief in a level playing field—has become deeply damaged. Hong Kongers once widely believed with hard work, some sacrifice and good education, anyone could improve their circumstances and achieve a good livelihood. Tycoons like Li Ka-Shing were adulated because they started with nothing and worked their way up. Today many fewer than before think hard work, sacrifice and good education can lead to better lives.  Indeed, many more believe government policy-making is unfair. As proof this is one major cause of unrest, the protest movement caught fire when local government officials refused to meet students demanding to be heard. Instead, they escorted 70 of the richest Hong Kongers to Beijing for private audiences with national leaders. Talking with students, on the other hand, helped to reduce numbers of protestors.  They demanded fair treatment, equal to that given the tycoons. The promise of a new platform for exchanging views with youth must be fleshed out in the address. Leung needs to schedule regular question and answer sessions with students like he already does with the city's chambers of commerce. Until those presently excluded from consultation are included, the belief the city's leader unfairly heeds business interests over everyone else will continue to undermine government legitimacy. Causes of unrest . Other fundamental causes of unrest stem from unintended consequences of previous decisions. A 2010 policy decision privatizing commercial space in public housing estates removed cheap rental access for younger and poorer entrepreneurs making Hong Kong's tycoon-dominated crony capitalism even tougher to break through. A real competition policy with teeth that makes sure tycoons compete equally with everyone else for business is essential. Rationalizing the hodgepodge of retirement ages and pension provisions into something simplified, consistent and fair is a must. Many youth resent being unfairly burdened with aging family members, and government shows very little awareness or sense of urgency. A proposal this year to extend the retirement age for civil servants to 65 prompted demands from unions to raise it immediately. People must be truly desperate.  Elsewhere, proposing to raise the retirement age sparks protests.  Here, it sparks demands for immediate implementation. People don't want handouts; they want fair treatment, whatever their age. Another source of unrest is the sheer press of numbers on our limited space. I strongly supported the decision to finally extend easier entry for mainland Chinese visitors in 2003. However, from a too low number of 8.5 million mainland tourists arriving in 2003, we now very likely have too many for our infrastructure to handle. With 40.7 million mainland Chinese visitors, we are likely hitting capacity. Chauffeured cars . Hong Kong needs central and local government officials who understand life's daily pressures and stress points. Perhaps Hong Kong should imitate what President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption policies have unleashed on the mainland: . Officials getting out of their chauffeured cars, giving up their maid service and joining the rest of us standing in long lines. It would only be fair. And that is why Occupy Central demanded that the next election for the city chief executive be fair. Everything else is not; and the tycoons and top officials don't get it. Until they do, Occupy Central's promise/threat of ""we'll be back"" is probably right.","The main pro-democracy protest camp was cleared on Thursday .

"Kobani, Syria (CNN)When violence swallows a city as wholly as it has Kobani, as in so many of Syria's mottled cities, the fight becomes about who wins, rather than what is left for the victor. Its streets have been so ground down to the bone, that the prize -- so small but so intensely fought over -- is now unrecognizable. Every time you open your eyes in Kobani, you see the damage. INTERACTIVE: Explore the devastation of this Syrian city . There are people still there, but it is hard to gauge how many. Food is scarce, as is fuel for heat. And day and night, indiscriminate, homemade mortars rain down on Kurdish homes -- ISIS borrowing a technique, it seems, from the Syrian regime, and using domestic gas canisters and junk metal to kill or maim civilians. You can hear the clank of these metal shards bouncing on the street outside as you try to sleep. Airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS -- often three thuds in rapid succession -- shake the very ground you are lying on. They have held ISIS back, but not enough for the Kurds. From what we saw, the front lines appear much more toward the city's center than some Kurdish advocates would suggest. To the city's west, too, ISIS fighters are nearer than sometimes advertised. This is a fight that is still in the balance. To the city's east is the most hotly contested front line. We are led there by Meedya Raqqa, the pseudonym of a 22-year-old Kurdish female fighter. In a testament to the egalitarian way the Kurds live, she is this unit's commander. She has been fighting ISIS for two years -- almost since the Sunni extremist group's beginning. ISIS fighters have been as close as five yards away from her. She has lost friends here, but also made them. 'I resist to avenge their death' ""I lost a lot of friends in this war and I resist to avenge their death,"" she tells me. ""No matter the destruction in Kobani, it can be built again -- the important thing is to destroy this strange enemy that entered our land."" The hardest loss to bear is that of her closest friend Reeban early this year. The Kurds have been fighting a lot longer than coalition airstrikes have been falling. ""I lost my best friend eight months ago. She killed herself to save her friends and the injured around her,"" Raqqa said. ""These are the difficult moments that we live, but I told you we gain strength from these martyrs. They are difficult moments that make you do more to avenge their death to make her dreams come true. The road she began, you finish."" The death itself was heroic and chilling. Reeban was surrounded but also injured. Her fellow fighters were too. They had used all their ammunition. ""Reeban pulled back the injured. She advanced while injured and then ISIS surrounded her. Girls are very prized by ISIS. She blew herself up. She killed a lot of them with her. Her last words to me were: 'We will liberate our land with the last drop of blood in my body.'"" Breaking the rules . Amid all the machismo war usually generates, it is jarring to see the defense of this city performed by women in their early 20s. They are very emotionally in touch with each other, often hugging -- the polar opposite of ISIS' worldview. ""Kurdish women's resistance will show the world a new history of women in which (women) can break all the rules that have no real basis in customs or traditions,"" said Raqqa. But first, the fight for Kobani. She leads us through a series of holes made in the walls of buildings rendered skeletal by the fighting in the east. One official called the city ""Kobanigrad,"" after the city whose people and essence the Soviet Union's Joseph Stalin sacrificed to make a point. Scavenged, aging weapons . It is hard to know what will be left to celebrate once the fighting ends, but up on the gun position she takes us to, the intensity of the battle remains clear. Heavy machine guns try to hit ISIS in the rubble. ISIS fighters lie dead in the no-man's land between the two front lines -- distant in their decay from the glorious death of which ISIS propaganda often talks. One navy machine gun jams repeatedly. This is a war the Kurds are still fighting with aging, scavenged weapons, even though pinpoint munitions fall from coalition jets onto their common enemy. Their fighters' repeated plea is for better weaponry. Across no-man's land, you can hear ISIS call out ""Alla-u-akhbar,"" God is the greatest -- the group's common rallying cry. The Kurds, also Muslims, mock it gently. Their two views of civilization are almost millennia apart, but now separated by a stretch of icy mud, increasingly smaller than they would like. CNN's Raja Razek contributed to this report.","Weeks of fighting between Kurds and ISIS have devastated the Kurdish city of Kobani .

"Hong Kong student protest leaders Joshua Wong and Lester Shum were among those arrested amid heated confrontations as authorities attempted to clear demonstration camps in the Mong Kok district for a second day. Wong, the 18-year old founder of the secondary school activist group Scholarism, and Shum, deputy secretary general of the Hong Kong Federation of Students, were arrested after police and bailiffs moved to clear barricades on Nathan Road in the bustling commercial area, a spokeswoman for the student federation told CNN. By midday Wednesday, authorities had cleared barricades and tents from the long-established protest camp. Prior to his arrest, Shum told CNN he urged protesters to remain on the streets until the ""last second."" ""We will still conduct our civil disobedience action until the last second, until the plaintiffs or the police arrest us,"" he said. Bailiffs have been engaged to clear the Mong Kok protest camps in accordance with a court order obtained by local business interests, following complaints that the protests have disrupted life in parts of the city for nearly two months. Police warned that anyone obstructing the bailiffs in their work would face charges of contempt of court or obstructing an officer. Some protesters were seen assisting authorities in dismantling shelters, as police ordered demonstrators disperse and not to interrupt the clearance. Others were tackled to the ground and detained by police during the clearance efforts. Night of clashes . The police action followed a night of heated clashes between police and protesters, after authorities attempted to clear another road in Mong Kok, Argyle Street, Tuesday. As of 6am Wednesday morning Hong Kong time, 116 people had been arrested during the confrontation in Mong Kok, according to Alice Tam of the Police Public Relations Branch. Offenses included resisting police, illegal assembly, possession of weapons and attacking police. Twenty police officers were injured in clashes, said Tam. Lawmaker and pro-democracy activist Leung Kwok-hung, commonly known as ""Long Hair,"" was among those arrested, his office confirmed. Tuesday's clearance effort began peacefully, with some protesters indicating their intention to relocate to other protest camps peacefully. But events spiraled into violence as crowd numbers swelled, with police dressed in riot gear spraying liquid referred to by local media as ""tear water"" toward the crowd to drive them back. Police warned protesters to retreat, displaying banners that read: ""Stop charging, or we use force."" As the situation Tuesday night escalated, activists issued calls on social media for reinforcements. The Hong Kong Federation of Students' tweeted: ""More support urgently needed in Mong Kok! Bring helmets, (goggles), shields, umbrellas, towels and be careful!"" As bailiffs announced their intention to clear the site Tuesday morning, protesters joined in chants calling for universal suffrage and demanding the resignation of Hong Kong's chief executive, C.Y. Leung. Prior to leaving on a trip to South Korea on Tuesday, Leung said he had confidence in police to handle the situation in Mong Kok and said the government remained willing to engage in dialogue on political reform. Universal suffrage . Pro-democracy protesters have occupied camps in parts of the city for nearly two months, and maintain a main protest site outside government buildings in Admiralty on Hong Kong Island. Calling for universal suffrage, they want to be able to nominate candidates for the election of the city's chief executive in 2017. Instead, China's National People's Congress has said they'll be able to vote only for candidates from a short list approved by a pro-Beijing committee. Currently, the chief executive is elected by a specially appointed 1,200-member election committee. At the peak of the protests in early October, tens of thousands of people were on the streets at three locations. But numbers have dwindled as the protests have continued, and recent local polling suggests support has dipped. In a random survey of 513 people conducted by the University of Hong Kong, 83% said pro-democracy protesters should cease their occupation of major roads in Hong Kong, while just 13% said the protests should continue. No plans to halt . Prior to his arrest, Shum told CNN there were no plans to give up the protests. ""The most urgent step is to revoke the August 31 NPC decision. The political reform problem starts from there,"" he said, referring to the Chinese central government's controversial decision to impose vetting restrictions on who could run as a candidate for Hong Kong's top office. ""If the Chinese communist party refuses to, or the Hong Kong government does not reflect how Hong Kong people think, we urge them to deny the political reform bill in the Legislative Council and restart the whole political process again."" He said the decision on whether to remain on the streets and face violence or arrest was each individual protester's own to make. ""I believe it is a personal or individual decision, because everyone has different degrees of consequences that they have to face alone,"" he said.

"U.S. Sen. John McCain took in the anti-government protest scene in Kiev's Independence Square, known as the Maidan, on Saturday, snapping pictures with his cell phone as he met with opposition leaders. He called it an ""incredible display of patriotism"" in a tweet that includes an aerial photo of the square. McCain also said he was with the younger brother of heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, who is one of the opposition leaders. The Republican senator has been critical of Ukrainian authorities' use of force against protesters. ""If Ukraine's government thinks that brute force and the politics of fear can see it through the current crisis, it is woefully mistaken,"" McCain said in a statement last week. Ukrainian prosecutors are investigating some top government officials regarding the beating of students at anti-government protests two weeks ago. The subjects of the criminal investigation include Ukrainian Deputy Secretary for National Security Vladimir Sivkovich, Kiev Police Chief Valery Koryak and Kiev Mayor Oleksandr Popov. A fourth person also is under investigation. The case will be put before a judge on Monday, who could order the those being investigated to house arrest, said Valery Vilkova, spokeswoman for the general prosecutor. The tumult in Ukraine goes to the heart of its future ties with Russia and the rest of Europe. Protests have unfolded in Ukraine since November 21 after President Viktor Yanukovych changed his stance on a trade pact with the European Union that had been years in the making. He refused to sign the agreement, which would have strengthened cooperation with the European Union. Instead, he opted for closer ties with neighboring Russia. Ukraine protests: 5 things you need to know . Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians have taken to the streets of Kiev to demand that the EU deal be signed. The demonstrations are the biggest the country has seen since the Orange Revolution overturned the results of the country's 2004 presidential election. Protesters have created camps and barricades throughout the city center, and have set up makeshift soup kitchens, said CNN iReporter Harvey Carrol. The epicenter of the protest has been in the city's central Maidan Square, where protesters have created a giant ""revolutionary"" Christmas tree decorated with flags and a giant poster of jailed former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. On Saturday, a pro-government rally was held at nearby European Square, according to the state news agency Ukrinform. Kiev police estimated about 57,000 people participated in the rally. Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov spoke at the gathering. Ukraine President offers amnesty to protesters .","U.S. Sen. John McCain visits anti-government protesters in Kiev .

"Liberia (CNN)First, the good news: Ebola is in decline. 2014 was a year of profound fear for communities living with -- and dying of -- the disease; of health workers making the ultimate sacrifice, dying as they tried to save; of apocalyptic forecasts as to the disease's possible spread. With 8,810 dead, governments and aid agencies are now giving a timeline on when they might reach zero cases -- and they're saying that could be in just a few months. That there are just a handful of cases left now in Liberia is an incredible feat, but it has come at an equally incredible cost. And Ebola is still critically dangerous. Hotspots remain. Sierra Leone has 65 confirmed cases, most in the west of the country around the capital and Port Loco where the disease spreads through overcrowded slums. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said last week that only half the cases in Liberia and Guinea came from known Ebola contacts, which suggests that hidden cases are causing outbreaks. Even as states of emergency and quarantine restrictions are lifted, there is a chorus of warnings against complacency. ""A single new case is enough to reignite an outbreak,"" says Brice de la Vigne, director of operations at Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders). ""Until everyone who has come into contact with Ebola is identified, we cannot rest easy."" And getting to zero can't be the end of it. Oxfam is calling for ""a massive post-Ebola Marshall Plan,"" saying the world ""cannot dither on recovery as it dithered over Ebola."" Their plea comes as the WHO and other agencies engage in intense soul-searching: What went wrong? Why did it take so long to turn the corner on this disease? Could it happen again? Admitting to organizational shortcomings Margaret Chan, the WHO's Director General, has asked the world's wealthier nations to step up to the plate and support poor countries' fragile health care systems. ""Well-functioning health systems are not a luxury,"" she insists. ""Well-functioning health systems are the cushion that keeps sudden shocks from reverberating throughout the fabric that holds societies together, ripping them apart."" Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea have never had well-functioning health systems. They have always had some of the lowest ratio of healthcare workers to patients in the world. Liberia had just one doctor for every 100,000 people in 2013 according to WHO figures. That works out at around 40 doctors for the whole country. Sierra Leone had two per 100,000 people. And there weren't even statistics for Guinea. Then Ebola destroyed what little healthcare they had, taking the lives of 488 health workers and leaving people too terrified to go through the doors of clinics they saw as harbourers of the disease. Children weren't vaccinated against other critical diseases. Centers distributing anti-retrovirals to the tens of thousands of people with HIV were closed. Mothers gave birth at home. Now trust in the region's decimated health care system is beginning -- albeit painfully slowly -- to return. At a clinic in Monrovia, mothers fill a waiting room. They've brought their babies in to be vaccinated -- there are no Disneyland immunization issues here. ""We know that during the height of the epidemic immunization rates collapsed by some 70%,"" says Sheldon Yett, UNICEF's country representative in Liberia. ""Now we're trying to climb back up but it will take time."" Placing preliminary healthcare within the community has also been a success. Laboratoriess and Ebola Treatment Units (ETUs) have been followed by Community Care Centres, or CCCs. The first were built in November in Sierra Leone. Now there are dozens in Sierra Leone and Liberia. Their basic aim is to provide a place within the community where people can be isolated and provided with preliminary care -- pain relief and oral rehydration -- in an environment which is safe and humane. Susan Michaels-Strasser, project director of the Global Nurse Capacity Building Programme at the Mailman School of Public Health at Colombia University, has just spent three weeks assessing the impact of these CCCs in Sierra Leone. She thinks they've played a huge role in restoring people's faith in Ebola-related care. ""We saw some amazing innovation,"" she explains. ""Where the family members can see their loved ones who have Ebola, so they're not taken behind a blue fence and never seen again. And even if the person doesn't survive they saw the care that was provided, they saw the attempts to save the life."" The original idea behind the CCCs was to train local volunteers in infection control procedures and have them man the units. But it turned out there were better options. ""What the various partners found when they went into these communities was that there were people, there were nursing students, there were retired nurses, there were nurses who had left the profession but had the skills, the ability and the desire to help,"" says Michaels-Strasser. And for all the fear, the heartache and the stigma around the disease, there's a clear sense of pride amongst those who are leading the charge against Ebola at a community level. Fanah Manasare is from Guinea's Forest Region. Aged 18 years old, he survived Ebola and now he goes from village to village spreading the word about the disease. ""Even elders will listen to me more than they would to you because I have been a victim of Ebola,"" he says, beaming with pride. Josephine Conteh says she is ""happy"" to be working as a nurse at the Pate Bana Maran Community Care Centre in Sierra Leone. ""My conscience -- if I saved one person here, I'm thinking that I have saved the whole nation. That makes me feel good."" The Ebola outbreak has helped create some hastily pulled together infrastructure which could form the building blocks of a more robust healthcare system in these three traumatised countries. And the disease leaves behind people galvanised for action as a result of their ordeal. Now the question is how to use these resources to transition from an emergency response situation to more sustainable healthcare provision in the future.","WHO says fight against Ebola has shifted from slowing transmission to ending epidemic .

"Pope Francis wants to bring hope to Christians and other ethnic and religious groups suffering ""brutal persecution"" in Iraq and Syria. The Pope used his Christmas Day blessing, ""Urbi et Orbi,"" to draw attention to displaced children and adults in the Middle East ""who for too long now have suffered the effects of ongoing conflict,"" he said, in a reference to the Syrian civil war and increased instability in Iraq with the rise of ISIS. The pontiff appealed for compassion for refugees ""so that all who now are suffering may receive the necessary humanitarian help to overcome the rigors of winter."" Tens of thousands gathered Thursday in St. Peter's Square in Vatican City to hear the pontiff's blessing, which is customarily global in nature. ""Urbi et Orbi"" is Latin, meaning ""to the city (Rome) and to the world."" The message comes a day after Francis delivered his second midnight Mass as Pope. The Pope has used his influence as the spiritual leader of all Catholics around the world to affect political outcomes this year. He played a key role in a historic breakthrough in U.S.-Cuba relations this month and urged religious tolerance during a visit to Turkey in November. His blessing Thursday included hope for peaceful resolutions of other conflicts around the world.  He prayed for reconciliation in Ukraine and for peace in Nigeria, where Islamic militants are killing and kidnapping people in the northern part of the African country. ""May Christ the Savior give peace to Nigeria, where more blood is being shed and too many people are unjustly deprived of their possessions, held as hostages or killed,"" he said. He also noted other African countries dealing with a rise in Islamic militant attacks and those fighting the Ebola crisis. ""Truly there are so many tears this Christmas,"" he said. Making a special appeal on behalf of youth, he said, ""May Jesus save the vast numbers of children who are victims of violence, made objects of trade and trafficking, or forced to become soldiers."" The Pope also addressed last week's school massacre in Pakistan in which Taliban militants gunned down students. ""May the power of Christ, which brings freedom and service, be felt in so many hearts afflicted by war, persecution and slavery,"" he said. Francis called on Christians to embrace their faith and reject selfishness.

In a separate incident, three civilians were killed and five injured in shelling overnight in Donetsk, the website of the city office said Monday. Residential and administrative buildings were damaged as a result of artillery fire, according to the site, which described the situation as tense.

"Dozens of Turkish hostages abducted by Islamist militants in northern Iraq were freed Saturday after three months in captivity. Militants from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria raided the Turkish consulate in June and seized 49 people, including Consul General Ozturk Yilmaz. Others abducted included his family, children and other citizens who were at the consulate in Mosul at the time, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said. Of the total, three were local employees and 46 were Turkish citizens. All were freed and the latter are now in their home country, Turkish authorities said. It's unclear how they were freed, but Erdogan thanked Turkish intelligence officials in a statement on his website. ""I thank ...  every single member of the national intelligence agency from the director to the field operatives,"" he said. ""I congratulate them for their big success from the bottom of my heart."" Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu  described it as a late-night operation. ""At around 11:30 at night, this rescue effort reached its final stage,"" he told a crowd waving flags in Ankara. ""Be assured that for months we worked toward this. I thank those in our national intelligence agency who worked relentlessly and with great sacrifice."" Mosul, a city of 1.6 million, collapsed swiftly when the militants attacked on June 10. The heavily armed radicals overran police stations, freed more than 1,000 prisoners from the local jail and took over the international airport. American-trained Iraqi forces ran in the face of the onslaught, leaving behind uniforms, weapons and armored vehicles. ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, has declared that it has established a ""caliphate"" spanning large swaths of Iraq and Syria. Turkey has been wary of joining a U.S. coalition to battle the militants because of the hostages, according to Faysal Itani, a fellow at the Atlantic Council's Center for the Middle East.

"Trust is, supposedly, the new currency of the sharing economy. It drives, to excuse the pun, data intensive sharing companies like Uber, the controversial transportation sharing startup now valued at $19 billion. Uber drivers get reviewed and are dismissed if they score badly and are considered untrustworthy. Even Uber users get scored by drivers and might not get picked up if they aren't well reviewed. Everyone gets rated on Uber. Everyone, that is, except senior Uber executives themselves. Last Friday night, at a dinner party set up by Uber as an off-the-record briefing, at Manhattan's exclusive Waverly Inn bistro, Emil Michael, the company's vice president of business, proposed a dastardly scheme to compromise one of Uber's leading media critics. Michael suggested that Uber use its vast collection of consumer data to ""dig up dirt"" on Sarah Lacey, the founder of the Silicon Valley news site Pando. Over a dinner attended by leading technology pundits, Michael suggested that Uber could spend ""a million dollars"" to hire a crack team of researchers and journalists. This investigative team might, he said, snoop into the personal and family life of a critic like Lacey who has relentlessly exposed many of Uber's creepiest features -- particularly what she calls  the ""asshole"" misogyny of its CEO, Travis Kalanick. Earlier this week, Michael's outrageous and perhaps even criminal idea was leaked by the Buzzfeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith, who attended the dinner. This, of course, has generated a massive storm of outrage amongst the technorati. Peter Thiel told CNN that Uber was the most ""ethically challenged"" company in Silicon Valley. While The Guardian's Dominic Rushe rhetorically asked whether Uber is Silicon Valley's ""worst company."" All over social media, people said the same thing: Emil Michael was the ultimate creep! The crowd had spoken. Michael's reviews were universally abysmal. He should be yanked, dismissed, fired. But that's exactly what hasn't happened. In spite of the popular outrage over Michael's behavior, Travis Kalanick wrote an unapologetic 12 part Twitter ""apology"" which rejected the idea of firing his most senior business executive. Uber investors have mostly remained conveniently silent with a few -- like the normally outspoken Jason Calacanis -- explicitly defending Kalanick and, by implication, Michael. In The Circle, his brilliant satire of technology companies like Uber, Dave Eggers coined the Orwellian phrase ""Sharing is caring"" to describe the hypocrisy enveloping Silicon Valley. But, of course, in the sharing economy of multi-billion dollar start-ups like Uber, sharing is only caring when it comes to dismissing lowly drivers or customers. Trust is only the convenient new currency of this economy when it suits Uber. Otherwise the ""new"" economy appears to be ominously old, with a rejection of transparency, democratization, openness, accountability and all the other buzzwords of the Internet revolution. We the people, however, may have the last laugh. The New York Times' Farhad Manjoo wrote that Uber's ""toughest challenge"" now is improving its dubious ethical behavior. While Dov Seidman, the CEO of LRN and a deep thinker about business ethics, notes that the principle challenge now of a successful startup like Uber is to scale its morality. ""In the past, technology entrepreneurs created and sold devices,"" Seidman says. ""Today, they create and sell platforms for human behavior, which in turn raises real questions about the social and moral implications of the behavior -- and their underlying values -- on their platforms and about the responsibility that they have for these behaviors. Tech entrepreneurs are obsessed about scaling their business models and products. But they should be just as, if not more, deliberate about scaling their values on their platforms and in their companies."" Travis Kalanick should listen to critics like Seidman. If Uber is to succeed, it needs to scale its morality in sync with its fast-growing business. Firing Emil Michael would be a beginning. It would say that Uber really is a trustworthy company. It would tell the world that Uber, and Kalanick himself, is beginning to grow up.","Uber under fire for alleged plan floated by VP .

"(CNN)Kurdish fighters have taken the Syrian city of Kobani from ISIS' grip after 112 days of fighting with the Sunni extremist group, multiple sources said Monday. The announcement comes a day after an Iraqi official declared that Iraq's Diyala Province had been ""liberated"" from ISIS. Idriss Nassan, Kobani's deputy foreign minister, told CNN he expects an official announcement Tuesday ""if things continue this way."" ""YPG is in control,"" Nassan said, using the acronym for the People's Protection Units. ""They are making sure to clear the streets and the places from ISIS to declare it a free city."" YPG spokesman Polat Can confirmed the news in a tweet: ""Congratulations for liberation of Kobani to all of humanity, Kurdistan and people of Kobani."" Nassan called for the quick implementation of a ""humanitarian corridor"" to help the myriad refugees in the city, whom, he said, ""need everything."" A Kobani official, who did not want to be named because it would interfere with Tuesday's official announcement, said the Kurds were going house to house in the newly liberated area to check for booby traps. Once the traps are removed or defused, the fighters will invite residents to return to their homes, the official said. According to London-based opposition group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights -- which also confirmed Kobani was liberated -- since October 6, when ISIS first raised its banner on the city's outskirts, the fighting among ISIS, YPG and the rebel battalions backing YPG has killed 979 ISIS combatants, 324 YPG fighters and 12 rebels. Thirty-eight more ISIS militants died in attacks using booby-trapped vehicles or explosive belts, and the ISIS shelling of Kobani killed 12 civilians, SOHR said. ""On the other hand, hundreds of (ISIS) militants died during U.S. and Arab allies' airstrikes on the city and its countryside. Meanwhile, large parts of the city have become uninhabitable due to U.S. and Arab allies air raids, detonation of booby-trapped vehicles and mutual shelling,"" the group said. Kobani apparently declared itself autonomous exactly one year before Monday's victory, SOHR said. A large-scale military operation to reclaim Iraq's Diyala Province from ISIS was successful, Iraqi transportation minister Hadi al-Amiri said Sunday. The operation started last week, and at least 58 people -- including two journalists -- were killed. Nearly 300 others were wounded. In a televised news conference Sunday, al-Ameri, who is also the head of the a powerful Shiite militia, said the province was ""liberated"" from ISIS. Al-Amiri said that Iraqi security forces are searching for ISIS militants who fled into orchards and farms in remote areas. Diyala Police  commander Brig. Gen. Jamil Kamel al-Shamari also announced that Diyala is now under full control of Iraqi security forces. ISIS has been fighting for Kobani for months, hoping to add it to the territory it already controls in Syria and Iraq as part of what it calls its independent Islamic nation. Syria has been embroiled in a more than three-year civil war, with government troops battling ISIS and other rebels elsewhere, leaving Kobani's ethnic Kurds to defend the city. Kobani, aka Ayn al-Arab, is strategically important because of its location on the border with Turkey. Airstrikes by the United States and its allies, part of a larger U.S.-led coalition effort against ISIS in the region, intermittently take out ISIS targets in the area. The coalition started operations in September.

"A federal prosecutor is pushing back against the claim by the grieving family of Internet activist Aaron Swartz that ""prosecutorial overreach"" was a factor in his suicide, saying her office acted ""fairly and responsibly."" News of the death of Swartz, 26, last Friday sent shock waves through the hacker community, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the larger online world. His family and partner issued a statement saying that federal charges filed over allegations that he stole millions of online documents -- mostly scholarly papers -- from MIT through the university's computer network contributed to Swartz's decision to take his own life. But the U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, Carmen M. Ortiz, disputed their account of events in a statement released late Wednesday, while expressing her sympathy ""as a parent and a sister"" for their loss. ""I know that there is little I can say to abate the anger felt by those who believe that this office's prosecution of Mr. Swartz was unwarranted and somehow led to the tragic result of him taking his own life,"" she said. ""I must, however, make clear that this office's conduct was appropriate in bringing and handling this case. The career prosecutors handling this matter took on the difficult task of enforcing a law they had taken an oath to uphold, and did so reasonably."" Anger, soul searching follow death of Internet activist . If convicted on the federal computer fraud charges he faced, Swartz could have been sentenced to 35 years in prison or a hefty fine. However, Ortiz said, prosecutors recognized there was no evidence Swartz had acted for personal gain, and considered that the harshest penalties available under the law were not appropriate for his alleged offenses. As a result, prosecutors told Swartz's legal team they would recommend to the judge a sentence of six months in a low-security setting, she said. At the same time, Swartz's defense was free to suggest to the judge that probation would be more appropriate, Ortiz said,  and the final call would lay with the judge. ""At no time did this office ever seek -- or ever tell Mr. Swartz's attorneys that it intended to seek -- maximum penalties under the law,"" she concluded. ""As federal prosecutors, our mission includes protecting the use of computers and the Internet by enforcing the law as fairly and responsibly as possible. We strive to do our best to fulfill this mission every day."" Ortiz dropped the charges against Swartz on Monday, a day before his funeral in Highland Park, Illinois. The statement from Swartz's family and partner had called his death ""the product of a criminal justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach."" How Aaron Swartz helped build the Internet . It also criticized U.S. prosecutors because they sought ""an exceptionally harsh array of charges (for) an alleged crime that had no victims,"" and MIT because it did not ""stand up for Aaron."" ""Decisions made by officials in the Massachusetts U.S. attorney's office and at MIT contributed to his death,"" his loved ones said. Swartz's suicide inspired a flurry of online tributes and mobilized Anonymous, the loosely defined collective of so-called ""hacktivists"" who oppose attempts to limit Internet freedoms. They claimed credit late Sunday for defacing several MIT websites. A White House petition to ""Remove United States District Attorney Carmen Ortiz from office for overreach in the case of Aaron Swartz"" was set up Saturday. By Thursday, it had garnered more than 40,000 signatures. Swartz, widely regarded as a digital prodigy, helped develop social news site Reddit and RSS, the technology that allows websites to send updates to subscribers, at a young age. On leaving Reddit, he engaged in Internet digital activism, co-founding Demand Progress, a political action group that campaigns against Internet censorship. But he pushed the legal limits, allegedly putting him on the wrong side of the law. In 2011, he was arrested in Boston and accused of computer fraud and illegally obtaining documents from protected computers. He was later indicted in an incident in which he allegedly stole millions of online documents from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He pleaded not guilty in September, according to MIT's The Tech newspaper. He had previously been investigated by the FBI after he released millions of U.S. federal court documents online. The alleged hacking was significant because the documents came from the government-run Public Access to Court Electronic Records, or PACER, which typically charges a fee, which in 2009 was 8 cents a page.

"(CNN)Gentlemen's clubs have been around since the 18th century, providing a safe haven for men who want to drink whiskey and read newspapers in peace. The original clubs are said to have started up in the West End of London, but exist all over the world with varying levels of exclusivity, only three now exclude all women. Not content with just gaining entry to these clubs, women are starting to create their exclusive spaces, but they are a far cry from the old cigar infused billiard rooms of old. These high tech hubs house women from all walks of life and allow them to rest, work out and socialize away from the male gaze. Whilst many of the clubs exist in London, the trend towards women-only spaces has begun to catch on across the Atlantic and may spread further.  Mary Aitken, founder and CEO of Verity explained that women have until now, ""existed in a work/home rut"" with no physical place to go, unlike their male counterparts who had clubs. CNN's Leading Women looked at the newest of this wave of clubs. 1. Grace Belgravia . Location: Belgravia, London . Yearly membership: From £1,875 - 7,500/$2982 - 11,926 . Men: Welcome after 6.30pm on weekdays, for Saturday and Sunday Brunch and on weekdays for breakfast from 7am - 9.30am. Also allowed in the medical clinic. Motto: ""Health is Wealth"" Grace Belgravia describes itself as a ""private club for spirited, cultured, caring women who want the very best for their health and well-being."" On target for their goal of 700 members next year, the club is fully equipped with a spa, hamman, Atelier, restaurant, bar, relaxation areas and a gym complete with trainers who utilize a unique methodology specifically created around the female body, mind and spirit, founded in the concept of 'prehab' training. After a work-out, members of the 11, 500 square foot club can eat fresh seasonal produce at the Grace Café and have access to the clubs private medical clinic. ""Grace very much reflects the values of Arianna Huffington's Third Metric, a piece which states that we must champion wellbeing, wisdom, wonder and giving in order to balance the quest for wealth and power,"" says founder Kate Percival. ""There's been a paradigm shift which means that increasingly women are seeking out other women's company. Not that they don't love their husbands and partners, but they often have deeper conversation with women than men. Women have become less competitive with each other, more embracing and there appears to be a sorority that is stronger than it's ever been. ""We are catering to that unique bond between women and fostering deeper connections. Grace is not remotely anti-men, just very pro-women."" 2. The University Women's Club . Location: Audley Square, London . Yearly membership: From £114 - 609/$180 - 963 . Men: Welcome as guests in all areas of the Club (except where en-suite facilities are not available) and at functions. Motto: ""A haven in London for educated women"" This club is for the educated woman, open to any female university graduate, the holder of a qualification from a professional body, or who has achieved experience and distinction in her field. ""The Club was founded in 1886 by a group of women who had studied at university (but at that time were not allowed to graduate) and found that there were no facilities for educated women in London at that time,"" says chairman Ann Hallam who is a consultant at a city law firm. ""They were amongst the very first women who went to University."" Networking is encouraged during social events, dinners and talks by women such as Kate Adie, Ann Widdecombe and Baroness Williams of Crosby. The 870 members come from far and wide and eminent women including Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, Millicent Fawcett, Baroness Young have been members. But it's a pretty exclusive place, women thinking of becoming members must be proposed and seconded by two existing members, those applicants who do not know a member will be invited to see the premises and to meet some of the members informally. ""(The club) has afforded opportunities to meet and make friends in a city where friendship and companionship may be hard to find,"" says Hallam. ""Particularly for younger members to take advantage of the knowledge which older members are keen to pass on. Our oldest member is over 90."" Membership options reflect the diversity of the clients with reduced prices for those who are studying, live out of town or are under 30. 3. The Sorority . Location: Online . Yearly membership: From £1,500/$2,348 . Men: Welcome at events . Motto: ""What belongs to you will come to you, when you create the capacity to receive it."" This club is an online network for professional women who want to collaborate and inspire others. While this is not a physical club, the members, 4% of whom are royalty, meet regularly at selected luxury venues in London. Membership is by invitation only, although by filling out their online pledge, you can encourage them to consider you for membership, just be sure to have a good answer to the question; 'What do you value most in life?' ""The way women connect with each other is unique,"" says founder Lisa Tse. ""We have a tendency to overly criticize ourselves and often underplay our successes and achievements. In a collegiate environment of women, we thrive as we are always so supportive of our friends and aim to bring out the best in each other in a way we never do for ourselves."" ""We are also in desperate need of providing role models of real women living real lives who are successful on their own terms. We need to move away from traditional stereotypes of businesswoman and success and embrace the diverse and rich experience of inspiring women with amazing stories to tell."" Members have to demonstrate a unique achievement as a business woman, entrepreneur, leader or pioneer, examples of those who have made it in to The Sorority include entrepreneurial Saudi Princess Reema Bandar al Saud, Television chef Ching He Huang and BBC presenter Katie Derham. 4. The Trouble Club . Location: Soho, London . Yearly membership: From £10 - £50/$16 - $78 . Men: Welcome . Motto: ""She was looking for Trouble, and she found it"" The naughty younger sister and latest addition to the private members club family, the Trouble Club was founded by Joy Lo Dico, editor of Londoner's Diary in the Evening Standard, her team includes PR guru Zara Shirwan and Frankie McCoy. ""There's something special about letting women - often in the minority in the work place - be in charge of the room"" said Lo Dico when asked why she started the club. After just 10 days, the club had 300 members who during the day are free to hot desk in the homely space on Lexington Street in Soho, but when the sun goes down, the space hosts talks by women from Stella Creasy to Nancy Del'Olio; ""We want make talking politics, tech, science and sport part of the natural conversation of women,"" explains Lo Dico. Membership is more straightforward that other clubs and the rates are kept low, so that no one feels they are priced out of the conversation. ""We are terribly exclusive,"" jokes the website.

"(CNN) -- Living at the China-North Korea border, I had the unique opportunity to train under two North Korean tae kwon do masters. While I told people I was there to learn the rare North Korean martial art from some of their best instructors, I was secretly helping North Korean refugees on the 6,000-mile modern-day underground railroad from the Hermit Kingdom to South Korea, for food and a better life. In 2004, I traveled to North Korea to see the country, even though many people warned me not to take the risk. One of our detained Chinese workers later said that North Korea had a file on me, but did not know my name. I lived with the fear of being detained, abducted or assassinated by the North Korean government for many years. Whenever I hear of another American detained, it reminds me of that anxiety. On Monday, three American citizens, Kenneth Bae, Matthew Todd Miller and Jeffrey Edward Fowle, all held captive in North Korea, were interviewed by CNN in a Pyongyang hotel room. This rare and surprise interview was an apparent move by the regime to get a high-ranking U.S. official to visit the country. North Korea has been collecting American citizens and planning for this very moment. What the North Korean government wants out of its latest stunt is simple: internal control and external respect. But this flawed strategy will hardly achieve its desired intent. North Korean regime leaders use these incidents to buy currency with their people, and these days, they can use all they can get. They want to send a message to North Koreans that says, ""Look at how powerful we are."" How North Korea may be using U.S. detainees as 'bargaining chips' After I watched the interviews with the three Americans, it was clear that it was a coordinated message to ask for a high-level U.S. envoy to be sent. It was no coincidence that all three requested this. Bill Richardson, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told USA Today, ""The North Koreans are sending signals to the U.S. that they are ready to deal."" Many North Korean refugees we sheltered in China told us how brutal the regime can be. This was confirmed by this year's U.N. report on the many human rights violations that North Korea has knowingly committed. Brutal interrogations, food deprivation and torture are all part of the North Korean playbook. But Bae, Miller and Fowle all said they are being treated humanely and are even provided with medical care. North Korea is walking a fine line here. It wants to use the three Americans as bait but not anger the United States so much that a high-ranking envoy will not come to the negotiating table. It seems the three men are being treated well, although it is hard to say definitively. North Korea has played this game before. President Bill Clinton paid a visit to secure the release of journalists Laura Ling and Euna Lee in 2009, and President Jimmy Carter visited in 2010 for the release of Aijalon Gomes. North Korea used both cases as propaganda ploys. But what the regime does not realize is that it is preaching to a disappearing choir. North Korea has enjoyed near complete control of the media its people consume in the past, but this is rapidly changing. Foreign DVDs are being smuggled in. People are hacking their radios to receive signals from the outside world. Phones connected to Chinese cell towers are being used along the border to relay messages in and out of the country. What the regime does not take into account is that, however it spins a visit by a high-level U.S. dignitary, there are diminishing returns to this familiar cycle. Meanwhile, the outside world it so wishes to impress by its ability to attract such luminaries is tiring of those games. North Korea wants control. It wants respect. At home, it is losing both. In the world, it has neither.","Mike Kim helped North Koreans escape at China border, lived with fear of being kidnapped .

"After unveiling its ""first Latina"" princess last week, Disney now says Jamie Mitchell, the producer of the TV show ""Sofia the First,"" ""misspoke"" during a press tour and that the title character is not a Latina. The word comes after questions arose about what made ""Sofia the First"" culturally relevant and why the media wasn't informed when the show was first announced in 2011. Backlash for Disney's first Latina princess . The National Hispanic Media Coalition, a Latino media advocacy organization, met with Nancy Kanter, Disney Junior Worldwide's senior vice president of original programming and general manager, to discuss the impact of ""Sofia the First"" in the Latino community. ""She shared that Sofia the First is in fact not a Latina character and that the producer of the television program misspoke,"" NHMC president and CEO Alex Nogales said in a statement. ""We accept the clarification and celebrate the good news that Disney Junior has an exciting project in early development that does have a Latina as the heroine of the show."" Just days before meeting with the media group, Kanter tried to clarify the princess' ethnicity on their Disney Junior Worldwide Facebook page: . ""Some of you may have seen the recent news stories on whether Sofia is or isn't a ""Latina princess."" What's important to know is that Sofia is a fairytale girl who lives in a fairytale world. All our characters come from fantasy lands that may reflect elements of various cultures and ethnicities but none are meant to specifically represent those real world cultures. The writers have wisely chosen to write stories that include elements that will be familiar and relatable to kids from many different backgrounds including Spain and Latin America. For example, Sofia's mom comes from a fictitious land, Galdiz, which was inspired by Spain."" There has been no confirmation from Disney on whether a project with a Latina heroine was already in the works, but the NHMC has agreed to share an alumni list from its writers program to help create authentic, three-dimensional Latino characters. Nogales said he appreciated Disney/ABC's commitment to diversity and that he looks forward to seeing more Latino lead characters as the stars of their shows.

"Take a larger than life governor who may have designs on the White House and a battleground state crucial in presidential politics, and guess what: 2013 might not be as quiet a political year as you thought. New Jersey and Virginia are the only two states to hold gubernatorial contests in the year after a presidential election, and in both states, the campaign clocks are already ticking. ""Virginia and New Jersey are going to get a lot of attention because they are the only games in town in 2013,"" said Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report. ""The eyes of the world are on these two races,"" agrees Colm O'Comartun, executive director of the Democratic Governors Association, who adds that ""next year in Virginia and New Jersey we're going to play a significant part."" And the two races will be a hot topic as the Republican Governors Association begins two days of meetings on Wednesday in Las Vegas. Analysis: It's never too early to talk about 2016 . In the wake of big Democratic victories in the 2008 election, the GOP swept both races in the Old Dominion and the Garden State from Democrats. ""In 2009, the victories in Virginia and New Jersey kick-started the GOP comeback in the 2010 midterm elections,"" said RGA Communications Director Mike Schrimpf, who suggested that Republican victories in 2013 could have a similar impact on the 2014 midterms. He added that ""it's a great opportunity for the Republican Party to get its focus back on results oriented leadership."" While both races will get tons of attention, New Jersey may steal more of the spotlight thanks to its tough-talking Republican governor, Chris Christie, who may also, down the road, be a contender for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination. Christie says his decision on running for re-election has been slowed by Hurricane Sandy's devastation to parts of his state. The governor has spent the past two weeks dealing almost exclusively with the powerful storm and its aftermath. At a news conference earlier this week, he  offered no timetable for a decision, but did say he'll soon give the 2013 race some serious consideration. Christie: Romney 'didn't get enough votes' While Christie has yet to make any announcement, some GOP strategists are convinced the first-term governor, who's very popular among Republicans and who served as a key surrogate for Mitt Romney's presidential campaign and was seriously considered as Romney's running mate, will run for re-election. ""The governor's race in New Jersey is ultimately going to be decided on the strength of Governor Christie's record,"" Schrimpf said. ""He's shown a tremendous ability to get big things done in a bipartisan fashion, including education reform, pension reform, and most recently with his leadership after Sandy. What voters want in their governor is a leader who can get things done, and there's no doubt that Governor Christie has gotten a lot done in his first term as governor."" Democrats see it a different way, and highlight the state's 9.8% unemployment rate. ""On the economic front I think he's failed to deliver again and again and again. He's got a huge raft of negatives against him that is sometimes hidden by the rhetoric and theater and side show that is Governor Christie,"" said O'Comartun, who added that ""New Jersey is a state that's brought down big characters before."" The big question in New Jersey is which Democrat will take on Christie. Much speculation centers on Newark Mayor Cory Booker, a rising star in the Democratic Party. Others considering bids are state Sen. Richard Codey, who served as governor for 14 months following the November 2004 resignation of then-Gov. Jim McGreevey, State Sen. Barbara Buono and Assembly member Lou Greenwald. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted last month indicated that 56% of New Jersey registered voters approved of how Christie was handling his duties, and by a 52%-40% margin thought he deserved re-election next year. In hypothetical matchups, Christie had a 46%-42% edge over Booker and a 47%-41% advantage over Codey, with double-digit leads over Buono and Greenwald. GOP expands majority in governors' mansions, CNN projects . In Virginia, where governors cannot run for consecutive terms, the question right now is whether Mark Warner wants his old job back. A new poll suggests if he does, it may be his for the taking. A Quinnipiac University survey released Wednesday indicated the first term U.S. senator would be the favorite candidate as the 2013 Virginia gubernatorial campaign gets under way. Warner, who was elected Virginia governor in 2001 and to the Senate in 2008, has said he'll announce by Thanksgiving if he'll stay in the Senate or make a bid for governor. According to the poll, Warner holds large leads over the two leading Republican candidates in hypothetical showdowns. Among registered Virginia voters, Warner leads Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, 53%-33%, and tops Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, 52%-34%. ""If Senator Mark Warner decides to run, he begins the campaign as the prohibitive favorite,"" says Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. ""He is much better known and much better liked than either of the Republican aspirants and his job approval rating - 60% - is the highest of any statewide elected official."" McDonnell: GOP must be more inclusive . But the general consensus among some Democratic strategists is that Warner will keep his current job. Terry McAuliffe, the former Democratic National Committee chairman and former top adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton, announced last Thursday that he'll make a second run for Virginia governor. McAuliffe came in second to state Sen. Creigh Deeds in a three-candidate battle for the 2009 Democratic nomination. Deeds ended up losing by a landslide in the general election to then-Republican Attorney General Bob McDonnell. If Warner stays in the Senate and McAuliffe is the Democratic nominee for governor, the poll indicates the race is much closer, with McAuliffe at 38% and Bolling at 36%, and McAuliffe at 41% and Cuccinelli at 37%. The battle for the GOP nomination could get very interesting, with Cuccinelli, a conservative tea party favorite, squaring off against Bolling, who is more moderate than his rival. Bolling, the two-term lieutenant governor, has McDonnell's endorsement. But the nomination will be decided next year at a state party convention, often dominated by more conservative activists, which favors Cuccinelli, rather than a primary, which could favor Bolling. While preparing for either outcome, the DGA relishes facing off against Cuccinelli, with O'Comartun saying he's ""the wrong man at the wrong time."" Virginia has become a battleground state in the past two presidential cycles, with President Barack Obama carrying the state for a second straight election last week. And the Democrats held control of the state's open U.S. Senate seat in last week's elections. But the RGA sees some positives going into next year's contest. ""I think the encouraging thing about Virginia is the Republican brand at the state level and particularly the gubernatorial level is extremely strong thanks to the leadership of Governor McDonnell and no matter who our nominee is, they're going to have a proven ability of getting elected statewide,"" Schrimpf said.","Two gubernatorial contests in New Jersey and Virginia will receive a lot of attention .

"Rowdy scenes erupted at the main Occupy Central protest site in Hong Kong on Monday after hundreds of people opposing the pro-democracy occupation tried to tear down protest barricades. Police formed a human chain to separate the protesters and people intent on breaking up their three-week long occupation of the Admiralty district, near the city's financial center. Dozens of men, some wearing surgical masks, were seen jostling with protesters and demanding that police remove the barricades and clear the roads, according to live images from local television station iCable. They were heard screaming at protesters, accusing them of damaging their livelihoods. The television commentator identified them as taxi drivers, transport industry workers and other people who said they weren't affiliated with any groups. However, protesters could be heard yelling, ""there are triads here,"" a reference to criminal gangs in the city known for controlling smuggling, prostitution and illegal gambling rings. Police on loudspeakers called for calm, and eventually convinced protesters to form a corridor to allow their opponents to leave. Earlier, police started to remove barricades from protest sites in Admiralty and Mong Kok, but issued a statement saying they were moving ""obstacles"" to relieve traffic ""not to clear the scene."" Police ""pushed back a couple of barricades, dismantling them,"" said CNN's Ivan Watson, from the Admiralty protest site. He said the protesters had responded by moving their tents closer to the barrier but the streets had remained peaceful. Protest disruption . At the peak of the protests, which started in late September, tens of thousands of demonstrators crowded onto the streets demanding a greater say in how the city is run. Protesters have been guarding barricades erected at the protest sites, and for many nights slept in the open air on bitumen before the arrival of reinforcements with tents on the weekend. Traffic in the other parts of the city has been clogged due to road closures, bus and tram cancellations and the need for cars to drive around the protest sites. Taxi drivers say their takings are down, and businesses have claimed the protests have cost them income. While protest numbers dwindled towards the end of last week, they started building again over the weekend when protest leaders called for reinforcements after the government called off talks planned for Friday. First live address . Over the weekend, Hong Kong Chief Executive C.Y. Leung made his first live address since protesters blocked key routes through the city.  Speaking on local free-to-air station TVB, Leung said the protests were not a ""revolution,"" but a ""mass movement that has spun out of control."" He said student leaders had ""almost zero chance"" of pushing Beijing to chance its stance on how Hong Kong's leader is elected. He added he would not accede to the protesters' demands that he resign, because his resignation ""will not solve the problem."" ""It is because the students and other occupation protesters demand more than that. They want the Standing Committee to withdraw its August 31 decision. That is impossible,"" he said. Beijing white paper . He was referring to the white paper issued by the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress stating that Hongkongers would be able to vote on their leader in 2017, but only from an approved shortlist of candidates. In response to Leung's comments, the three main groups leading the occupy campaign said it was the government that was out of control -- ""a government that fires tear-gas at unarmed citizens and unilaterally terminated dialogue with the students (sic)."" On September 28, police fired 87 tear gas rounds into the crowd after protesters failed to disperse. The move was seen as a miscalculation and only served to garner support for the protesters who accused the government of heavy handedness and of stifling free speech. Open letter to China . Over the weekend, student leaders from protest group Scholarism and the Hong Kong Federation of Students wrote an open letter to Chinese President Xi Jinping, urging him to closely consider their cause. ""There will only be more citizens, disillusioned with our corrupted institutions, marching and protesting, as long as no genuine democracy is practiced in this place,"" they wrote. The letter said the occupation was ""definitely not a colour revolution or its alike, but rather a movement for democracy,"" referring to the term ""umbrella revolution"" which was coined after protesters used umbrellas to shield themselves from pepper spray and tear gas. View from China . Xi has not commented on the protests, but Chinese censors have been busy blocking reports of the movement, including access to the photo-sharing site Instagram. A commentary published in China's state-controlled People's Daily on Monday, entitled ""Why is the U.S. so keen on Color Revolutions?"", accused the U.S. of meddling in Hong Kong affairs. ""It is hardly likely that the U.S. will admit to manipulating the ""Occupy Central"" movement, just as it will not admit to manipulating other anti-China forces. It sees such activities as justified by ""democracy,"" ""freedom,"" ""human rights"" and other values,"" it said. It said the mainstream U.S. media had shown ""exceptional interest"" in ""Occupy Central"" and had tried to portray it as Hong Kong's version of a ""Color Revolution,"" referring to pro-democracy movements around the world including the ""Arab Spring"" and Ukraine's ""Orange Revolution."" ""The U.S. may enjoy the sweet taste of interfering in other countries' internal affairs, but on the issue of Hong Kong it stands little chance of overcoming the determination of the Chinese government to maintain stability and prosperity,"" it added.","Scuffles as people opposing occuption try to remove protest barricades .

"The Obama administration fiddled while Benghazi burned and four Americans died. Late last week, Jennifer Griffin of Fox News reported that CIA operators caught in the attack in Benghazi requested military backup but were denied by higher headquarters. If true, this would exhibit fatal inaction and negligence on the part of the administration or the military's chain of command, or worse, some sort of cover-up. On Friday, President Obama was asked directly by Denver's KUSA-TV's Kyle Clarke whether our forces were denied backup during the attack. The president dodged the first question. Clark followed up, ""Were they denied requests for help during the attack?"" ""Well, we are finding out exactly what happened,"" the president responded. ""I can tell you, as I've said over the last couple of months since this happened, the minute I found out what was happening, I gave three very clear directives. Number one, make sure that we are securing our personnel and doing whatever we need to."" This is different from what the president said in his Rose Garden speech on September 12, when he mentioned nothing about securing personnel the evening of the attack, or what he said to ""The View"" or Univision in the weeks after the attack. We now know that President Obama met with Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Vice President Joe Biden in the Oval Office at 5 p.m. ET on the night of the attack. We also know that the first e-mail announcing the attack came in at 4:05 pm ET, about a half hour after the attack started, and that there was a drone overhead monitoring the attack and diplomatic security official Charlene Lamb was monitoring the audio feed of the attack in real time in Washington. That night, the Commander's In-extremis Force, a special rescue team of commandos, was moved from Europe to Sigonella, Italy, about a two-hour flight from Benghazi. Also that evening, a ""FAST team"" (Fleet Anti-terrorism Security Team) of Marines in Rota, Spain, was deployed to protect the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli. The Pentagon was aware of the attack and put forces into motion. All information seems to indicate President Obama or the highest-ranking officials in the White House and Pentagon knew of the attack the same evening it occurred. Which begs the all-important question: Why was no additional military aid sent to secure our personnel, like the president claimed he directed? Shortly after the fighting started in Benghazi, the embassy in Tripoli (400 miles away) sent its own separate aid, dispatching an aircraft carrying 22 men. They didn't arrive in Benghazi until hours into the battle and were not nearly as qualified or as equipped as the Special Forces standing by in Europe. The battle raged for seven hours, resulting in the death of four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. It finally ended at dawn the next day when Libyan militia forces showed up to aid the Americans. Asked to explain the inaction on the part of the Pentagon, Panetta said, ""The basic principle is you don't deploy forces into harm's way without knowing what's going on, without having some real-time information about what's taking place."" Contrary to Panetta's claim, we know with certainty that there was real-time information coming into Washington and the Pentagon during the attack. We are therefore left with two conflicting explanation's for the administration's inaction -- either the president's directive to secure our personnel wasn't heeded, or he didn't exactly give such a directive. After all, as former Marine captain and former assistant secretary of defense, Bing West, has so well chronicled, directives of such serious importance would be recorded and sent throughout the chain of command. The administration insists that aid was not declined. ""Neither the president nor anyone in the White House denied any requests for assistance in Benghazi,"" National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor told Yahoo News this past Saturday. We will wait and see what unravels in the coming days, but regardless, the public deserves to know why, with real-time intelligence of the attack, Panetta and defense officials did not immediately send military aid to secure our personnel. It's been more than a month since the Benghazi attacks and many of the crucial details are still unknown. Some of the mainstream media have been reticent to cover in-depth the story in Benghazi. Since the second presidential debate, Mitt Romney has been noticeably silent on Libya; he shouldn't be. Without the Republican House investigating it, one wonders whether Benghazi would be a story at all. The death of four Americans at the hands of terrorists deserves serious and sustained attention. Sunlight is the best disinfectant. The administration's first explanation, a spontaneous mob reaction to a YouTube video, has already been shattered. Now we are left putting together the real story piece by piece. Either there was serious malfeasance on the part of this administration or a knowing cover up with shifting stories and blame. Either way, the American people deserve to know the full story of the disaster in Benghazi.","William Bennett: President Obama needs to come clean about the Benghazi disaster .

"Mitt Romney is trying to cut into the considerable lead President Obama had among Jewish voters by showing that he is even more of a supporter of Israel than his rival. After suggesting the Obama administration threw Israel ""under the bus,"" Romney made an even stronger warning to Iran not to go nuclear, and pledged to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Romney is hardly the only one who believes that the Jewish vote swings to the candidate in presidential elections who is the most fervent supporter of Israel. The same position was given voice in a 2007 book by two highly regarded political scientists, The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy, which suggests that Jews have undue influence over U.S. foreign policy by making campaign contributions, pressuring members of Congress, and by casting their votes to support Israel. A controversy erupted in 2011-12 concerning ""Israel Firsters,"" a term referring to American Jews who are said to promote Israeli policies to the point where they ""put the interests of the Israeli right above everything else,"" as one writer put it. A recent survey shows that Romney will be disappointed. If Jewish votes follow what this survey reveals, Obama will gain somewhat less support from Jews this year than he gained in 2008 -- but the same will be true for other groups of voters, including African-Americans. And most Jews who will change the party they vote for will not ""swing"" because of his position on Israel. Opinion: Are voters still picking leader of free world? For the vast majority of Jews, Israel ranks surprisingly low in their considerations as voters. Early in 2012, the Public Religion Research Institute found that among self-identified Jewish adults, 51% of those registered to vote cited the economy as the most important issue driving their voting decision. Fifteen percent cited the growing gap between the rich and the poor, while 10% cited health care and 7% the deficit.  Only 4% cited Israel as the most important issue to their vote. As David Harris, Executive Director of the nonpartisan American Jewish Committee, put it, ""Jews are multi-issue voters. The notion they are single-issue voters is simply wrong."" Despite criticism of Obama's handling of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, for instance by three Brookings Institution scholars in the book Bending History,  approximately 60% of Jewish voters in the Public Religion Research Institute survey reported a very favorable or mostly favorable view of Obama and said that they approve of the way he is doing his job. On the specific issue of how Obama is handling the Arab-Israeli conflict, the survey found Jewish voters to be divided: 20% of the Jews surveyed said that they agree with the president's policies and his execution of them, while 15% reported that they agree with his policies but not his execution of them.  Twenty-eight percent reported that they disagree with his policies, while 36% said that they are not sure of their opinion of how Obama is handling the conflict.  Hardly a bloc vote. Indeed, evidence shows that Jews tend to vote as a group no more than -- and often less than -- several other key groups. A Pew Research Center poll conducted in 2011 found that 65% of the Jews polled reported leaning Democratic and 29% reported leaning Republican.  The same poll found white evangelicals reporting a 70-24 split in favor of Republicans. Eighty-eight percent of black Protestants reported leaning Democratic, with 6% leaning Republican.  Mormons leaned Republican by an 80-17% margin and atheists leaned Democratic by a 71-21% margin.  A Gallup poll conducted in April also showed 70% of Latino Catholics favoring Obama, with 20% supporting Romney, and 10% remaining undecided. Opinion: Both parties have a huge race problem . All this is not to question that Jews care about Israel -- although many liberal Jews are very critical of its policies, and there are many liberal Jews -- just as Irish, Polish, Armenian and other Americans care about the nation they or their forefathers are from and to which they feel an ethnic affinity. However, to jump from noting such sentiments to the conclusion that therefore members of these groups will put these concerns above their commitment to America or allow these concerns to determine their vote must be supported by data. At least in the case of the Jewish vote, data show the opposite is the case. Israel is a decisive factor in shaping the vote of only 4 out of 100 Jewish voters. Romney's campaign team better keep its Champagne bottles corked.","Mitt Romney is trying to outdo President Obama in his support for Israel, says Amitai Etzioni .
It's a myth that the Jewish vote goes to whoever supports Israel more fervently, Etzioni says .
Only 4% of American Jews cite Israel as their most important voting issue, he says .
And 51% of those registered to vote cited the economy as the most important issue, he says ."
"Dozens of people have been killed and thousands of homes burned to the ground in Myanmar's volatile Rakhine state in recent days, amid an upsurge in violence between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims that prompted the government to declare a state of emergency. CNN looks at the background to the ongoing communal violence in the Southeast Asian country. What's behind the unrest? Overnight curfews in several towns and villages across the region have been in place since May, when the arrest of three Muslim men suspected of raping and killing a Buddhist woman sparked deadly clashes between the Rohingya and Rakhine Buddhists. Two of the men have since been sentenced to death, while the third hanged himself while in detention, the government-run newspaper New Light of Myanmar reported on its website. The following month, 10 Muslims were killed when several hundred people attacked a bus in the state's Taungup district, reportedly believing some of the passengers were involved in the murder. The violence then spread across the northern part of the state, resulting in the destruction of thousands of homes and the deaths of almost 100 people, according to the government. A state of emergency in Rakhine was declared, with the military deployed to help restore order. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Myanmar estimates that around 75,000 Rohingya have been displaced by the unrest. The simmering tensions between the two ethnic groups erupted again this week in several towns across the state, despite the curfew, with reports that at least 50 people had died and hundreds of homes burned to the ground, according to state officials. Opinion: Aung San Suu Kyi and the power of unity . Who are the Rohingya? The Rohingya are a stateless Muslim minority living in Rakhine -- thought to number between 800,000 and one million -- who claim they were persecuted by Myanmar's military during its decades of authoritarian rule. Myanmar does not recognize them as citizens or one of the 135 recognized ethnic groups living in the country. Much of this is rooted in their heritage in East Bengal, now called Bangladesh. Though many Rohingya have only known life in Myanmar, they are viewed by Rakhine's estimated three million Buddhists as intruders from across the border. According to Human Rights Watch, the country's laws discriminate against the Rohingya, infringing on their rights to freedom of movement, education, and employment. They are denied land and property rights and ownership. The land on which they live can be taken away at any given time. HRW has also accused security forces of opening fire on the Rohingya population during the recent wave of violence -- an accusation denied by the government. What are the authorities doing? In August, Myanmar's president, Thein Sein, announced that an internal commission, including representatives from different political parties and religious organizations, had been formed to investigate the recent sectarian violence -- a move welcomed by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. ""This commission is comprised of a representative cross-section of national figures in the country,"" Ban said in a statement. ""It could make important contributions to restoring peace and harmony in the state and in creating a conducive environment for a more inclusive way forward to tackle the underlying causes of the violence, including the condition of the Muslim communities in Rakhine."" President Sein discussed the situation with Ban during the U.N. General Assembly in New York in September, pledging to ""address the root causes of the tensions,"" according to a U.N. spokesman. The move followed Sein's warning in June that the ongoing ethnic strife could harm Myanmar's development and stability as it continues its rehabilitation as a fledgling democracy. What is the world saying? Tomas Quintana, the U.N.'s human rights rapporteur for Myanmar, in August called for an independent investigation into allegations that authorities are using excessive force and committing other human rights violations while trying to restore order in Rakhine state. Quintana said such an investigation was needed to guarantee accountability. ""Reconciliation will not be possible without this, and exaggerations and distortions will fill the vacuum to further fuel distrust and tensions between communities,"" he said. Thousands of Rohingya have attempted to flee the unrest, with neighboring Bangladesh the main destination. But many have been turned away by the authorities. Bangladesh has reinforced its border, amassing troops and security officials along the River Naf, which provides a natural boundary between the two countries, where rickety fishing boats filled with refugees attempt to cross over. In June, Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Dipu Moni said her country was not willing to give shelter to anymore refugees, despite international calls to open its borders. ""We're already burdened with thousands of Rohingya refugees staying in Bangladesh and we don't want anymore,"" she said. Human Rights Watch says tens of thousands of Rohingya refugees are currently staying in makeshift camps in Bangladesh, with many living in conditions that seasoned aid workers have described as ""the worst they have ever seen."" According to the rights group, the inhabitants face overcrowding, shortages of food leading to widespread malnourishment among the children, a lack of clean water and sanitation resulting in disease, and restrictions on movement coupled with extortion and human rights abuses.","Rohingya are a stateless Muslim minority living in Myanmar's Rakhine state .

"Germany's interior minister says his country's confidence in the United States is shaken, amid claims the U.S. National Security Agency monitored Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone. ""If the Americans intercepted cell phones in Germany, they broke German law on German soil,"" Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper, adding that he wants ""complete information on all accusations."" ""The confidence in our ally, (the) USA, is shaken,"" Friedrich said, according to Bild am Sonntag. Obama promises changes . Citing an unnamed intelligence officer, the German newspaper also reported Sunday that U.S. President Barack Obama learned about the NSA operation targeting Merkel from agency chief Gen. Keith Alexander in 2010 and allowed it to continue -- a claim the NSA denied. ""Gen. Alexander did not discuss with President Obama in 2010 an alleged foreign intelligence operation involving German Chancellor Merkel, nor has he ever discussed alleged operations involving Chancellor Merkel,"" NSA spokeswoman Vanee' Vines told CNN. German magazine Der Spiegel, meanwhile, reported that Obama told Merkel he would have stopped it from happening, if he had known about it. Such reassurances appear to have done little to quell outrage from German officials over the alleged espionage, which was reported last week by Der Spiegel. Europe falls out of love with Obama over NSA spying claims . The magazine's report, which cites a secret U.S. intelligence file, claimed Merkel's phone had been monitored for more than 10 years, stretching back before her current post. It's the latest in a series of spying allegations that have challenged relations between the two long-time allies. The same database indicated the United States was spying on many others in Berlin's political district, at least up to the time when  Obama visited Berlin this year, Der Spiegel reported. Now Germany is sending a group of senior intelligence officials to Washington to discuss the reports, the government's press office said last week. Asked about these claims, U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said her agency does not ""comment publicly on every specific intelligence activity."" ""And, as a matter of policy, we have made clear that the United States gathers foreign intelligence of the type gathered by all nations,"" said Hayden, echoing comments she and others have made in recent days. Still, it remains to be seen if citizens and leaders in Europe will accept such explanations -- and whether recent efforts by the Obama administration to address their concerns will be successful.

"Starkville, Mississippi (CNN)Mitt Romney donned the plaid shirt and jeans again Wednesday to take on a familiar activity of eating local food and shaking hands, a normal day from his not so distant past -- and perhaps his near future. The 2012 GOP nominee stopped for some barbeque at The Little Dooey in Starkville less than a couple hours before changing into a suit for a speech at Mississippi State University. An older man sitting in a booth shook Romney's hand and urged him to run for president. ""We need you up there in the White House,"" he said. ""You're very kind,"" Romney replied, patting the man on the arm. ""I wish I were there right now, I gotta tell ya."" As Romney positions himself for a possible third run for president, he's sketching out what appears to be a new platform that would be heavy on anti-poverty policies and reaching out to nontraditional voters. RELATED: Romney on minority outreach: 'Stop thinking so much about the primary' The millionaire also has the challenge of overcoming a narrative leftover from the 2012 campaign that he was out of touch, and he's already signaled some ways he might reveal a more authentic self if he runs, the Washington Post reported. At the restaurant, Romney teased the reporters who stood close by as he munched on his pulled pork sandwich, saying there's ""an unwritten rule"" about not taking pictures of politicians eating. But he continued to eat anyway. ""Do you still consider yourself a politician, then?"" one reporter asked, to which Romney replied: ""You're taking my picture. What can I say?"" Another asked if this is ""the new Romney,"" noting that he appeared not to care that he was eating before the cameras. ""I didn't know I had a choice,"" he shot back, drawing some laughs. After Romney inched through the restaurant to meet students, sign books and take selfies, he sat down with the university's football coach, Dan Mullen, who led the bulldogs to the Orange Bowl this year. Romney compared the leadership styles of running a business and coaching a football team. In politics, Romney argued, there's too much emphasis on what a person says, rather than what a person does. ""It'd be nice if people who run for office, that their leadership experience and what they've accomplished in life would be a bigger part of what people focus on, but it's not,"" he said. ""It's mostly what you say."" What you do, Romney continued, to argue, ""is a lot more important that what you say,"" noting how a football coach's reputation is almost entirely based on his record. ""You could be the sweetest talking person in the world, but unless you got a record, you're in trouble,"" he said. . While he doesn't seem to miss the close scrutinizing that comes with running for president, Romney spent the first half of his speech later that night dishing out some 2012 nostalgia laced with self-deprecating humor. He said he received some advice from someone he met on the campaign trail to stop shaving so he can ""grow a little more stubble for a few days to look more sexy."" ""As if I needed that,"" Romney said flatly, drawing a big laugh from the audience. Still, he called it ""the most remarkable"" journey of his life, and mentioned ordinary people whom he calls ""heroes"" that he met on the campaign trail. He specifically named two people in Iowa and New Hampshire who followed him to a hoard of campaign events, and he praised them for devoting their lives to people they believed would ""make the country better."" Romney offered no specifics about where he stands in his decision making process, but felt confident that ""the great days of America have not ended; they're ahead with the right kind of leadership.""","Mitt Romney met with college students at Mississippi State University in Starkville .
His stop at a barbeque joint was reminiscent of his 2012 campaign days on the trail ."
"Tensions between Israel and Hamas ratcheted up Monday after the bodies of three Israeli teenagers, kidnapped this month, were found in the West Bank. Israel, in no uncertain terms, blames the disappearances and deaths on Hamas. ""Hamas will pay,"" said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri warned against escalation, saying that if Netanyahu ""brings a war on Gaza, the gates of hell will open to him."" The three bodies were found northwest of Hebron, according to the Israeli military, which said they were still in the process of being identified. The teens -- Eyal Yifrach, 19; Gilad Shaar, 16; and Naftali Frankel, a 16-year-old dual U.S.-Israeli citizen -- disappeared late June 12 or early June 13 from the Jewish settlement of Gush Etzion in the West Bank, the military said. ""Although the identification has not been officially confirmed, I would like to send my support and condolences to the Shaar, Frankel and Yifrach families,"" Maj. Gen. Nitzan Alon, with the Israel Defense Forces, told reporters. He vowed to pursue those responsible. ""The war on terror continues. It didn't begin now and it will not be over soon,"" Alon told reporters. ""We will do whatever it takes to deter Hamas and other terrorists and we'll continue to fight terror using every legal means at our disposal."" An aunt of one of the victims told CNN she was still in shock. ""I'm holding his picture and I see his smile,"" said Leehy Shaar, Gilad Shaar's aunt. ""He's so young and innocent ... It's just too sad to even imagine."" 'United in mourning' Netanyahu called an emergency security Cabinet meeting about the issue Monday. ""All Israel tonight is united in mourning the three teens who were brutally murdered by the Hamas terrorists,"" said Mark Regev, a spokesman for the Prime Minister, stressing that Israel will ""continue to act against Hamas in order to protect our people."" ""Hamas says every Israeli man, woman and child, every civilian, is a legitimate target for these sort of terrorist attacks, so we're totally within our rights to protect ourselves against those Hamas terrorists who want to kill our people,"" Regev said. When asked whether he holds the Palestinian Authority responsible in any way for the teens' deaths, he responded: ""It's clear that the terrorists came from areas under Palestinian Authority control and returned to territories under Palestinian Authority control."" The spokesman urged Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to annul his pact with Hamas. His comments were echoed by U.S. Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, chairman of the House Middle East and North Africa subcommittee; and Ted Deutch, D-Florida, ranking member of that subcommittee. ""We will continue to support the government of Israel in its efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice, and we offer the people of Israel our deepest and most heartfelt condolences as we grieve with them. If it is determined that Hamas is behind this horrific tragedy, Abu Mazen must immediately break up the unity agreement between Fatah and Hamas, a U.S. designated foreign terrorist organization,"" they said in a statetment. Abu Mazen is another name for Abbas, whose government now includes Hamas, which controls Gaza. Global outcry . Abbas called an emergency meeting of his own. The Palestinian leadership is expected to meet Tuesday to discuss the developments. U.S. President Barack Obama, Pope Francis and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon were among world leaders condemning the killings Monday. ""As a father, I cannot imagine the indescribable pain that the parents of these teenage boys are experiencing. The United States condemns in the strongest possible terms this senseless act of terror against innocent youth,"" Obama said in a statement. He continued: ""From the outset, I have offered our full support to Israel and the Palestinian Authority to find the perpetrators of this crime and bring them to justice, and I encourage Israel and the Palestinian Authority to continue working together in that effort. I also urge all parties to refrain from steps that could further destabilize the situation."" Last week, the Israel Security Agency said it believed that two ""Hamas activists from Hebron"" were behind the teens' disappearances. It identified them as Marwan Qawasmeh, 29, and Amar Abu-Isa, 32. As Israeli media were reporting on the bodies' discovery Monday night, Israeli forces were blocking roads into Hebron, a city in the southern West Bank. Fighter jets could be heard flying low over Gaza. Overnight into Tuesday, more than 40 Israeli airstrikes hit Gaza, according to Palestinian security and medical sources. The strikes targeted Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other militant groups, the sources said. The Israeli military later said that forces had carried out strikes against 34 targets in Gaza, targeting terror infrastructure, after the firing of 18 rockets at Israel since Sunday evening. Within days after the teens disappeared, Israeli security forces conducted an extensive search for them and detained more than 150 Palestinian suspects. Netanyahu blamed Hamas for the kidnappings almost immediately. A Hamas spokesman said in the days after the abductions that the Prime Minister's comments attributing blame were ""stupid and baseless."" Also in the days after the abductions, the mother of one of the teenagers spoke to reporters. The three ""were just on their way home,"" said Naftali's mother, Racheli Frankel. ""We trust"" that they ""will be with us here, and we'll hug them soon.""","Israel carries out airstrikes against nearly three dozen targets in Gaza .

"(CNN)The number of new Ebola cases reported in the three worst-hit countries fell to its lowest level since late June, the World Health Organization said Thursday. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone had a combined total of 99 new cases for the week ending January 25, the WHO said. The total breaks down to 65 in Sierra Leone, 30 in Guinea and four in Liberia. The number of cases continued to fall in Liberia and Sierra Leone, WHO said, but Guinea's figure rose from 20 confirmed cases in the previous week. The western district of Forecariah -- where the local community has shown high levels of resistance to measures to limit the disease's spread -- was the worst-affected in Guinea, with half the new cases for the week, the report said. The response to the Ebola epidemic has now moved to a second phase, WHO said, ""as the focus shifts from slowing transmission to ending the epidemic. ""To achieve this goal as quickly as possible, efforts have moved from rapidly building infrastructure to ensuring that capacity for case finding, case management, safe burials, and community engagement is used as effectively as possible."" There have been more than 22,000 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases since the outbreak began, with almost 8,800 known deaths. According to the latest WHO report, children are less susceptible than adults to contracting the virus, which spreads through direct contact with an infected person's bodily fluids. People aged 15 to 44 are approximately three times more likely to be affected than children aged up to 14, while adults aged 45 and older are almost four times more likely to be affected than are children. Even as the number of cases drops, scientists around the world continue to study the virus in a bid to understand how it works and help develop more effective vaccines against it. Dr. Anavaj Sakuntabhai, human geneticist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, is part of a team working to sequence the virus and monitor how it mutates. ""It's very important for us to follow what happens with the virus sequence,"" he told CNN. While the virus is not that mutated yet, he said, ""It's important for us to monitor how it changes and see whether it is more contagious or more lethal."" His team is using samples from blood collected from Guinea and processed by colleagues based in Dakar, Senegal, who've been working on the Ebola project since April last year. Sakuntabhai's team has sequenced about 20 samples so far and hopes to do another 100 in the coming weeks, ultimately sequencing several hundred. Many people's fears have focused on whether the virus could change to become airborne, but it doesn't appear to be easy for it to mutate sufficiently to alter the mode of transmission, he said. Sakuntabhai said it was normal for the virus to change and that it's ""not something to be frightened of at the moment."" CNN's Debra Goldschmidt contributed to this report.","Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone had 99 new cases for week ending January 25 .

"(CNN)Guardrail debris from a previous crash was to blame for a prison transport bus leaving the interstate and crashing into a moving train earlier this month near Odessa, Texas, the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday. Eight inmates and two correctional officers were killed in the crash. According to the NTSB, the 225-foot-long metal guardrail leading up to an overpass was damaged in a vehicle collision the day before the prison bus accident. Subsequent crashes caused by icy conditions moved portions of the guardrail onto traffic lanes. The bus, westbound in the left lane, apparently struck the guardrail pieces, veered to the left and hit an embankment before becoming airborne. At the base of the embankment, the bus continued toward the railroad tracks below the overpass, striking the 54-car train. Five more people -- four inmates and one staff member -- were injured in the incident and hospitalized. The bus was traveling from a prison facility in Abilene, Texas, to one in El Paso, Texas.","NTSB says debris on roadway caused bus to lose control .

"(CNN)Eric Frein accused of killing a state trooper and injuring another, on Thursday entered a not guilty plea by video from Pennsylvania's Pike County Correctional Facility during his arraignment, according to his attorney. The attorney, Michael Weinstein, attended the hearing in Milford, Pennsylvania, to enter the plea on behalf of his client, while co-counsel William Ruzzo was with Frein at the jailhouse. Weinstein said his client appeared fine, and understood and answered questions asked by the judge. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Frein, who is accused of shooting two state troopers -- killing Cpl. Bryon Dickson and injuring Trooper Alex T. Douglass. Frein faces a dozen charges, including terrorism and first-degree murder, in connection with the September ambush outside the state police barracks in Blooming Grove, Pennsylvania. Frein led a small army of law enforcement officers on a weeks-long manhunt in eastern Pennsylvania. The self-styled survivalist and military buff was captured on October 30 at an abandoned airport. Who is Eric Frein? The manhunt lasted almost seven weeks, and involved as many as 1,000 officers at times. Authorities said the search cost more than $11 million in salaries, travel, equipment, utilities and other expenses. Prosecutors had previously said they intended to seek the death penalty. They submitted the formal paperwork on Tuesday. Frein's lawyer said the move was expected. ""There's a lot of work ahead, and there's just so much more to do,"" Weinstein said. ""We need to make sure we have everything analyzed correctly. Right now, it's all just in the early stages, so once we get the evidence laid out we can go from there,"" he said. Police uncover Frein's trove of survival supplies . After his arrest, Frein allegedly told investigators he ""wanted to make a change (in government) and that voting was insufficient to do so, because there was no one worth voting for,"" according to a court affidavit. Frein called the killing of Dickson an ""assassination,"" the court documents said. The suspect said the shootings were an attempt to bring about a change in government and to ""wake up people, because it was all he could do."" Frein charged with terrorism .

"(CNN) -- Supporters of a banker caught looking at photos of a semi-nude model on live TV have launched a Web site in a bid to save his job. David Kiely, who works for Sydney-based Macquarie Private Wealth, has become a Web sensation after he was filmed on Australian television admiring pictures on his computer screen of scantily-clad Miranda Kerr. Kiely was opening e-mailed pictures of Kerr while one of his colleagues, Martin Lakos, was being interviewed on Channel 7 news behind him on Tuesday. His employer has said it is investigating the actions of the client investment manager who, according to Australian media reports, is said to be on gardening leave. A Web site has now been set up calling for Kiely to be reinstated. An email petition, Here is the City, writes: ""Whether set up or not, Kiely was really only guilty of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. There but for the Grace of God."" It says Kiely ""seems like a nice bloke, the pictures were not hardcore and that he had already suffered enough."" It adds: ""There's just too much political correctness in this world anyway."" A posting of the clip on YouTube had attracted more than 1.3 million hits by Thursday, along with thousands of comments, with many viewers arguing Kiely was unlucky to be caught on TV. ""He looks like a nice guy and I'm sure he must be a goodÿþ analyst since he is working there,"" said one YouTube viewer. ""I really feel for him -- if I was a top shot there, I wouldnt let him go. Listen we've all made mistakes in our lives. He was caught on camera, also he wasn't looking at something really dirty.""

"For a Canadian city once called the country's most polite, it was a shocking scene. SWAT teams swarmed neighborhoods and surrounded buildings Thursday. Authorities shut down schools. Police warned residents to stay inside and lock their doors. But more than a day after a gunman killed three police officers and wounded two others in the Canadian city of Moncton, New Brunswick, investigators hadn't found the suspect. Catching him remains the ""No. 1 priority,"" Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cpl. Chantal Farrah told reporters Thursday afternoon. She asked residents not to share any photos of police activity. ""All the operations that you see unfolding in your neighborhood, do not take photos of that, do not put photos on social media, and that's going to help us resolve this,"" she said. On Wednesday evening, police say a man dressed in fatigues and carrying a rifle went on a rampage, killing three police officers and wounding two others. Police say the suspect is 24-year-old Justin Bourque of Moncton. On Thursday morning, police spotted Bourque at least three times in the area, but did not catch him, New Brunswick Royal Canadian Mounted Police Superintendent Marlene Snowman said. The search for the suspect continues, and Snowman asked residents to stay indoors and remain calm. The victims were all officers of the RCMP, said Roger Brown, the commander for the New Brunswick RCMP. ""This is perhaps the darkest day in the history of RCMP New Brunswick,"" he said. Authorities have not released the names of the officers killed, saying they are waiting for all family members to be notified. Police don't know -- or haven't disclosed -- what prompted the attacks. Police leaders appeared emotional as they conveyed the few details they had to reporters. ""As you can imagine, this is working through your worst nightmare,"" Brown said. Last social media post? A Facebook page purported to belong to Bourque has many posts with pro-gun photos and a few anti-police memes. There is also one photo in which two men pose with shotguns in the snow. It was posted February 25, six days after the Facebook page was created, and is used as the profile picture. In what appears to be his final post, the page's author used the words of a song by the metal group Megadeath. A cockroach in the concrete, courthouse tan and beady eyes. A slouch with fallen arches, purging truths into great lies. A little man with a big eraser, changing history . Procedures that he's programmed to, all he hears and sees.

You say you've got the answers, well who asked you anyway? Ever think maybe it was meant to be this way? Don't try to fool us, we know the worst is yet to come. I believe my kingdom will come. Terror outside the window . The rampage began Wednesday evening when police responded to a report of an armed man in the north end of Moncton. The gunman opened fire. Three RCMP officers were shot and killed, Constable Damien Theriault told reporters. ""Two of our officers were also injured, but their lives are not threatened at this time,"" he said, his voice breaking at times. One of the wounded police officers remains hospitalized, and another officer has been released from the hospital, Farrah said Thursday. Joan MacAlpine-Stiles recalled seeing the gunman when she opened a window. ""It was really warm in the house, so we opened up the windows in the family room, and there he was going across through the back with this rifle on his shoulder,"" she told CNN partner CBC. ""I said, 'Oh, my God, there he is with camouflage and the headband and a gun,' and it looked like a bow he had with him, and I mean, he was just through our backyard,"" she said. After police arrived, neighbor Vanessa Bernatchez watched with a couple of others from a living room window. She uploaded a video of the confrontation to Facebook. ""He shot him. He shot the ... cop,"" a man in the video exclaims. ""Call 911!"" 'That could never happen here' Moncton, a city of about 140,000 people, is about 150 kilometers (93 miles) northeast of Saint John. The Canadian magazine Chatelaine has described Moncton as one of the best places to live and work in Canada, according to the city's website. In addition, Reader's Digest recently named Moncton as the most polite city in all of Canada, the city said. Such accolades seem to matter little now. The violence shook Moncton and beyond. ""It's a lot. Especially for a city like this, where you wouldn't expect something to happen like this,"" resident Jonathan Hurshman told CTV. ""You see it all in the States, and you think, 'No, that could never happen here' -- and sure enough, it happens here."" There were no homicides in Moncton in 2011 and 2012, and the average number of homicides per year between 2006 and 2011 was one. In 2012, the homicide rate in Canada was 1.6 per 100,000, while in the United States, it was 4.7 per 100,000, according to United Nations statistics. Hurshman told CTV that he tried to get close to the confrontation with his video camera, only to be brusquely turned away by police. He didn't see the suspect, but he heard the gunshots and saw what he thought was a police officer on the ground. ""There was a lot going through my head. It was a lot to take in, seeing something like this happen here,"" he said. Hurshman's family would remain inside their house all day, he told CTV, but early Thursday, he witnessed neighbors who didn't feel safe packing their cars and leaving. As the hunt dragged into Thursday morning, police continued giving updates and warnings. ""Shooter still believed to be in Pinehurst Subdiv. area of Moncton. Stay locked inside. Avoid area,"" the RCMP's New Brunswick office tweeted. All entrances to the neighborhood where the attack took place were blocked off, city spokeswoman Isabelle LeBlanc said Wednesday night. Her husband had not been able to get home. Even some buses were pulled off the road out of concern for public safety, she said. Searching while grieving . As police keep looking for the gunman, they must do so while grieving the deaths of their colleagues. When asked how officers would push through, Constable Theriault said, ""We are professional."" Moments later, he choked up and ended the news conference. Stabbed Wisconsin girl improving, family says .

"Of all the speeches at the Democratic convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, few offended conservative listeners more than the speech by Sandra Fluke. There are plenty of good reasons to be annoyed. From the conservative point of view, Fluke is on the wrong side of a battle over religious freedom. Back in March, she testified in favor of a proposed Obama administration rule that would require Catholic institutions, like her own Georgetown University law school, to reject the teaching of their church and cover contraception in their university health plans -- plans not funded by taxpayers, by the way, but by tuition and other university revenues. Now here Fluke was again, on the national stage, warning that a vote for the Republican ticket in 2012 was a vote for ""an America in which you have a new vice president who co-sponsored a bill that would allow pregnant women to die preventable deaths in our emergency rooms. An America in which states humiliate women by forcing us to endure invasive ultrasounds we don't want and our doctors say we don't need. ""An America in which access to birth control is controlled by people who will never use it; in which politicians redefine rape so survivors are victimized all over again; in which someone decides which domestic violence victims deserve help, and which don't."" Shortly before Fluke spoke, conservative commentator Ann Coulter had tweeted: ""Bill Clinton just impregnated Sandra Fluke backstage."" That was nothing compared with the outpouring of fury during and after the speech. Stephen Kruiser, who hosts on the conservative Internet video site PJTV and appears on Fox's ""Red Eye,"" tweeted mid-speech: ""Tricky camera work to keep TV audience from seeing (David) Axelrod's hand up Fluke's a**."" The next day, National Review columnist and sometime Rush Limbaugh guest host Mark Steyn scoffed: ""Sandra Fluke has been blessed with a quarter-million dollars of elite education ... and she has concluded that the most urgent need facing the Brokest Nation in History is for someone else to pay for the contraception of 30-year-old children."" Sandra Fluke: Slurs won't silence women . James Taranto, columnist for the online edition of The Wall Street Journal, was nearly equally scathing. ""Seriously, the party of Andrew Jackson and Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman chose to showcase someone whose claim to fame is that she demands that somebody else pay for her birth control."" Within 48 hours, the attack had jumped from the conservative media sphere to electoral politics. Campaigning in Addison, Illinois, Republican congressional candidate Joe Walsh erupted: ""Think about this, a 31-, 32-year-old law student who has been a student for life, who gets up there in front of a national audience and tells the American people, 'I want America to pay for my contraceptives.' You're kidding me. Go get a job. Go get a job, Sandra Fluke."" There's never any shortage of vitriol in political commentary, but usually it's reserved for the headliners. Yet Fluke provoked more sputtering in five minutes than former President Bill Clinton did in a speech 10 times as long. Why? The answer takes us to the events that put Fluke on the stage in Charlotte in the first place: Rush Limbaugh's brutal, sexualized attack on her congressional testimony. On the day after Fluke spoke, Limbaugh demanded: ""What does it say about the college co-ed Sandra Fluke, who goes before a congressional committee and essentially says that she must be paid to have sex, what does that make her? It makes her a slut, right? It makes her a prostitute. She wants to be paid to have sex. She's having so much sex she can't afford the contraception. She wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to have sex. What does that make us? We're the pimps."" Limbaugh returned to the subject again and again, escalating his abuse over three consecutive days. ""So Miss Fluke, and the rest of you feminazis, here's the deal. If we are going to pay for your contraceptives, and thus pay for you to have sex, we want something for it. We want you to post the videos online so we can all watch."" After three days of this, advertisers began to drop his show -- and Limbaugh was constrained to issue a grudging apology on his website. ""For over 20 years, I have illustrated the absurd with absurdity, three hours a day, five days a week. In this instance, I chose the wrong words in my analogy of the situation. I did not mean a personal attack on Ms. Fluke. ""I think it is absolutely absurd that during these very serious political times, we are discussing personal sexual recreational activities before members of Congress. I personally do not agree that American citizens should pay for these social activities. What happened to personal responsibility and accountability? Where do we draw the line? If this is accepted as the norm, what will follow? Will we be debating if taxpayers should pay for new sneakers for all students that are interested in running to keep fit? In my monologue, I posited that it is not our business whatsoever to know what is going on in anyone's bedroom nor do I think it is a topic that should reach a presidential level. ""My choice of words was not the best, and in the attempt to be humorous, I created a national stir. I sincerely apologize to Ms. Fluke for the insulting word choices."" In this grudging half-apology, half-justification, Limbaugh misstated the facts of the case. Taxpayer money was never at issue between Fluke and Georgetown. When Fluke and her fellow students paid tuition to Georgetown, they got health coverage as part of the deal. At issue in Fluke's congressional hearing were principles of religious freedom -- and the disposition of student health dollars -- but not taxpayer money. Limbaugh's misstatement had the benefit of permitting him a change of subject -- and a way out of a damaging controversy. And it allowed his friends and supporters to pronounce the matter closed. Yet somehow it didn't close: not for Fluke, and not for Limbaugh either. Why this election is so personal . Other male commentators have used belittling, misogynistic language against other women in the public eye. Both Republican and Democratic women have found themselves on the receiving end of condescension and epithets. But Limbaugh did something different with Fluke: Aggressively and deliberately, over a long span of days, because his own commercial interests require shock and controversy, Limbaugh had promoted Fluke into a totem and martyr. When Democrats later claimed that Republicans ""waged war on women,"" Limbaugh's tirade became Exhibit A -- at least until Rep. Todd Akin's ""legitimate rape"" comment demoted it to second place. At the time of the tirade, a number of Republican politicians spoke out against Limbaugh. U.S. Sen. Scott Brown called Limbaugh's comments ""reprehensible"" and former Senate candidate Carly Fiorina condemned them as ""insulting."" Yet as time has passed, the regrets faded. An idea was born and grew that somehow Fluke must have provoked what was said of her, must indeed have deserved it. Erick Erickson of CNN and Red State.com expressed this ""she asked for it"" view pungently in a March blog post: ""Of course Rush Limbaugh was being insulting. He was using it as a tool to highlight just how absurd the Democrats' position is on this. It's what he does and does quite well. And in the process he's exposing a lot of media bias on the issue as people rush out (no pun intended) to make Sandra Fluke a victim of his insults and dance around precisely what is really insulting ? her testimony before congress that American taxpayers should subsidize the sexual habits of Georgetown Law School students because, God forbid, they should stop having sex if they cannot afford the pills themselves."" That mood, an undercurrent until recently, gushed into full view on the night of Fluke's convention speech. If the words ""slut"" and ""prostitute"" are not to be used, she must nonetheless be the thing indicated by those not-to-be-used words: a woman whose sexuality is for sale. Because if she's not -- if she's merely a concerned citizen who expressed in a public forum a diverging view of the appropriate relationship between church and state -- then what does that make Limbaugh? And what does it make those who rallied to defend Limbaugh? Something pretty ugly, right? Which is why it remains today so urgently necessary for so many people to demean and defame this woman. The correct reply to Fluke is that she is a person intolerant of the religious liberty of the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church does good works on a vast  national scale -- caring for the sick, teaching children, supporting the homeless -- all to uphold its compassionate doctrines in a harsh world. Once government starts imposing its rules on a church, then it crushes the spirit that leads the church to do its good on the world. You can say all that without hurling accusations of nymphomania, freeloading and sexual exhibitionism. In fact, omitting such vile insults makes the rebuttal more convincing, not less. But that's not how Rush Limbaugh does it, and he has taught a generation of conservative shock-mongers to do the same or worse.

"In the early 1960s, a young postdoctoral student stumbled onto something that puzzled him. After reading the literature on cannabis, he was surprised to see that while the active compound in morphine had been isolated from opium poppies 100 years before and cocaine isolated from coca leaves around the same time, the active component of marijuana was still unknown. This simple observation launched his life's work. That young Israeli researcher, Raphael Mechoulam, is now a heavily decorated scientist, recently nominated for the prestigious Rothschild Prize. More than 50 years ago, however, he had trouble starting his scientific journey. For starters, he needed cannabis to study and didn't know how to obtain it. Eventually, he obtained his research supply from friends in the police department. The young scientist was in a hurry, and didn't want to wait to cut through the red tape required by Israel's Health Ministry. ""Yes, I broke the law,"" he told me when I met with him in Tel Aviv last year, ""but I apologized and explained what I was trying to do."" It's a good thing the Israeli government didn't stall his progress, because Mechoulam was moving at breakneck speed. Dr. Sanjay Gupta: ""Doubling down"" on medical marijuana . By 1963, he determined the structure of cannabidiol (CBD), an important component of marijuana. A year later, he became the first person to isolate delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. Over the ensuing decades, Mechoulam and his team continued to isolate numerous compounds from the cannabis plant. Their work also went a long way toward illuminating how the drug works in the brain.  When Mechoulam's team identified the first known endogenous cannabinoid, a chemical actually made by the brain itself, he named it ""anandamide."" In the Sanskrit language, ananda means ""supreme bliss,"" which gives us some insight into what Mechoulam thinks of cannabinoids overall. It was halfway through our long afternoon discussion that Mechoulam, now 83, pulled out a paper he had written in 1999, describing something known as ""the entourage effect."" Think of it like this: There are more than 480 natural components found within the cannabis plant, of which 66 have been classified as ""cannabinoids."" Those are chemicals unique to the plant, including delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiols. There are, however, many more, including: . --Cannabigerols (CBG); . --Cannabichromenes (CBC); . -- other Cannabidiols (CBD); . --other Tetrahydrocannabinols (THC); . -- Cannabinol (CBN) and cannabinodiol (CBDL); . --other cannabinoids (such as cannabicyclol (CBL), cannabielsoin (CBE), cannabitriol (CBT) and other miscellaneous types). Other constituents of the cannabis plant are: nitrogenous compounds (27 known), amino acids (18), proteins (3), glycoproteins (6), enzymes (2), sugars and related compounds (34), hydrocarbons (50), simple alcohols (7), aldehydes (13), ketones (13), simple acids (21), fatty acids (22), simple esters (12), lactones (1), steroids (11), terpenes (120), non-cannabinoid phenols (25), flavonoids (21), vitamins (1), pigments (2), and other elements (9). Minister's daughter: Cannabis ""a gift from God"" Here is the important point. Mechoulam, along with many others, said he believes all these components of the cannabis plant likely exert some therapeutic effect, more than any single compound alone. While science has not yet shown the exact role or mechanism for all these various compounds, evidence is mounting that these compounds work better together than in isolation: That is the ""entourage effect."" Take the case of Marinol, which is pure, synthetic THC. When the drug became available in the mid-1980s, scientists thought it would have the same effect as the whole cannabis plant. But it soon became clear that most patients preferred using the whole plant to taking Marinol. Researchers began to realize that other components, such as CBD, might have a larger role than previously realized. To better understand the concept of the entourage effect, I traveled to the secret labs of GW Pharmaceuticals, outside London. In developing Sativex, a cannabis-based drug to treat multiple sclerosis, the company's chairman, Dr. Geoffrey Guy, told me the company ran into some of the same obstacles that Marinol faced. More than a decade of experiments revealed that a whole plant extract, bred to contain roughly the same amounts of THC and CBD in addition to the other components in the plant, was more effective in reducing the pain and spasms of MS than a medication made of a single compound. It could be that multiple individual compounds play a role, or it could be due to their interaction in the body; it could also be combination of both, Guy said. Now, maybe this all sounds obvious. After all, eating real fruits, vegetables and other plants provides better nutrition than just taking vitamin pills with one nutrient or mineral in each. Science is showing us that we can likely say the same about cannabis. As we move forward with creating medicines, like Charlotte's Web, for the patients who can benefit from cannabis -- this is an important point to keep in mind. Unlike other drugs that may work well as single compounds, synthesized in a lab, cannabis may offer its most profound benefit as a whole plant, if we let the entourage effect flower, as Mechoulam suggested more than a decade ago.

"From around Aleppo in western Syria to small areas of Falluja in central Iraq, al Qaeda now controls territory that stretches more than 400 miles across the heart of the Middle East, according to English and Arab language news accounts as well as accounts on jihadist websites. Indeed, al Qaeda appears to control  more territory in the Arab world than it has done at any time in its history. The focus of al Qaeda's leaders has always been regime change in the Arab world in order to install Taliban-style regimes. Al Qaeda's leader Ayman al-Zawahiri acknowledged as much in his 2001 autobiography, ""Knights Under the Banner of the Prophet,"" when he explained that the most important strategic goal of al Qaeda was to seize control of a state, or part of a state, somewhere in the Muslim world, explaining that, ""without achieving this goal our actions will mean nothing."" Now al-Zawahiri is closer to his goal than he has ever been. On Friday al-Qaeda's affiliate in Iraq seized control of parts of the city of Falluja and parts of the city of Ramadi, both of which are located in Iraq's restive Anbar Province. Anbar is home to predominantly Sunni Muslims, who feel that that the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki treats the Sunnis as second-class citizens. Sectarian tensions in Anbar recently burst into several all-out revolts against the government, and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), as the al-Qaeda affiliate there is known, quickly seized the opportunity to notch some battlefield victories. Government forces increased their presence around Falluja in response and on Tuesday tribal leaders issued a statement urging people who had fled the city or stopped reporting to work to return. ISIS is also operating in Syria, where it has established a presence in many areas of the Aleppo and Idlib Governorates in the northwest. In August, ISIS launched a propaganda series on video highlighting their activities in Syria, which includes interviews with fighters; the ""graduation"" of a group of mujahedin ""cubs"" (aged about 7 to 10 years old) from training, and sermons at local mosques preaching al Qaeda's interpretation of Islam. The al-Nusra front has claimed to control parts of at least a dozen Syrian towns. Those include sections of the ancient city of the Aleppo in the northwest, where fighters have been filmed running a community fair and preaching al Qaeda's values to crowds of children. The group has also released videos on jihadist websites claiming that it is providing services to the people of several towns in the governorate of Idlib, which borders the Aleppo Governorate to the west. Al Nusra claims that it is a quasi-government and service-provider in the towns of Binnish, Taum, and Saraqib. Al-Nusra fighters allied to al Qaeda function like a government in areas they control in Syria. The group provides daily deliveries of bread, free running water and electricity, a health clinic, and a strict justice system based on Sharia law in the eastern Syrian city of Ash Shaddadi, where it also took control of the city's wheat silos and oil wells. In September a CNN reporting team concluded, ""Al Qaeda has swept to power with the aim of imposing a strict Islamist ideology on Syrians across large swathes of Syria's rebel-held north."" In sum, al Qaeda affiliates now control much of northern and northwestern Syria as well as some parts of eastern Syria, as well as much of Anbar province, which is around a third of Iraqi territory. Al-Nusra is engaged in a protracted fight to maintain a foothold in the eastern city of Dayr al-Zur, where, as in Ash Shaddadi, the militants have their hands on an energy source, this time in the form of natural gas. On Friday the group released a video on a jihadist website claiming it was grinding some 10 tons of wheat each day to provide bread for the residents of Dayr al-Zur.  In the video, a bearded man who identifies himself as part of al-Nusra gives a National Geographic-esque tour of a wheat silo where bags of wheat are filled, weighed, and transported to a bread-making facility, where industrial mixers churn dough. Similar videos released throughout the second half of 2013 depict al-Nusra fighters providing health care, legal services, electricity and food to civilians in the cities of Daraa, Homs, Hama, and even the suburbs of the capital Damascus, where the government still enjoys fairly secure authority. Al Qaeda's expansion in Syria will not continue unchecked, though. Many Syrians are unhappy about being ruled by the strict jihadist militants. Over the past several days fighting has broken out between ISIS and an alliance of various rebel factions in Syria, including al-Qaeda's other affiliate in the country, the al-Nusra Front. This fighting has taken a toll on ISIS, which has been forced to withdraw from a number of key Syrian towns as a result of attacks by the other rebel groups. The infighting amongst Syrian rebels is not good news for the fate of the uprising against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, but it could prompt the United States to increase its shipments of arms and supplies to ""moderate"" Syrian rebels in the FSA. However, even an increase in U.S. aid to the rebels would be unlikely to sway the conflict significantly, which means al-Assad will remain in power and the war will continue as it has over the past three years. Secretary of State John Kerry said on Sunday that the United States will ""do everything that is possible to help"" the Iraqi government control al Qaeda's expansion in Anbar, but stressed that no American troops would be sent back to the Middle Eastern nation . Last month, the United States quietly sent Hellfire missiles and surveillance drones to the Iraqi government to support their fight against increasing al Qaeda-related violence. This weaponry is unlikely to make a substantial difference to the mounting violence in Iraq where violence has returned to the levels it was in 2008, near the height of the Iraq war. Indeed, by any reasonable standard Iraq is now mired back in a civil war. Last year almost 8,000 Iraqi civilians were killed in the conflict, according to the UN. For the United States the widening reach of al Qaeda in the Middle East doesn't necessarily translate into an immediate threat at home. So far only a handful of Americans have fought in the Syrian conflict alongside al Qaeda's affiliates there so concerns about some kind of ""blowback"" from the Syrian war in the U.S. are, at this point, unfounded, . European countries are rightly concerned, however. Many European countries have seen their citizens drawn to the Syrian war; more than a hundred from Britain and many dozens from countries like Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands, according to multiple European officials we have spoken to. These countries are concerned that the retuning veterans of the Syrian conflict might launch terrorist attacks in Europe. In October for instance, British authorities arrested militants who were allegedly planning a terrorist attack. Two British officials who work on counterterrorism issues told us that that the militants had recently traveled to Syria. The United States and its allies should therefore make a careful effort to track the foreign fighters who have joined jihadist groups fighting in Syria.","Al Qaeda affiliates made gains in Syria and Iraq in recent months .

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN)Angry mobs upset over the handling of militant group Boko Haram on Thursday pelted the motorcade of Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan. The protesters hurled stones at the convoy as it left the palace of a traditional chief in Jalingo, the capital of the northeastern state of Taraba, where Jonathan had gone on a courtesy call before holding a rally as part of his re-election campaign. Nigerians will vote for their next president February 14. Several vehicles were damaged in the attack, according to witnesses. ""As soon the convoy left the palace of the emir of Muri, the crowd threw stones and broke the windscreens of several vehicles and dented others,"" said Jalingo resident Clement Moses. The crowd, made up mostly of young men, was angry at the heavy military and police presence deployed for the presidential visit. Armed soldiers and policemen blanketed the city and forced businesses to close. ""People were angry with the huge military deployment for the president, while Boko Haram continue(s) to run over towns and villages in neighboring Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states,"" said Bala Jika, another resident. ""They kept shouting that soldiers should deploy to Sambisa forest in Borno state and fight Boko Haram instead of coming to the city and harassing the people already traumatized by Boko Haram,"" Jika said. Policemen fired tear gas to disperse the crowds. There were no immediate reports of injuries or arrests. Jonathan has come under heavy criticism at home and abroad over his response to Boko Haram. The group has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, and bombing government buildings. The Islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. It has sacked dozens of villages close to the border with Cameroon this month, slaughtering residents and abducting others. Thursday was not the first time the president's convoy was attacked. On January 20, his motorcade was stoned in the northern city of Katsina, where he was campaigning. Jonathan faces a formidable challenge from a opposition alliance.

"(CNN)Pat yourselves on the back, readers! The pangolin is now a little safer because of you. Last year, after I wrote about the illegal trade in these artichoke-shaped, scale-covered mammals, CNN Digital readers donated more than $20,000 toward the shooting and production of an anti-pangolin-poaching public service announcement (say that three times fast ... ) and media campaign. The PSA is now airing in Vietnam, which is a hub of the illegal trade. Hosted by a Vietnamese newscaster, the advertisement is expected to be seen on 60 national and provincial television channels in the country, and is airing on at least 20 stations as of this week, according to Education for Nature Vietnam, a environmental non-profit that commissioned the PSA. ""Our native species, the pangolin, is being threatened by hunters and traders who defy the law to profit from nature, regardless of the cost to Vietnam's environment,"" the newscaster, Hoai Anh, who was described to me as ""the female Anderson Cooper of Vietnam,"" says in the clip. She continues: ""If you buy pangolin scales or eat pangolin meat in restaurants, you are directly supporting these criminal networks."" The PSA ends with a call to action, asking viewers to call a hotline to report illegal wildlife crime. Pangolin scales are used in traditional medicine and were openly available in markets when I visited Vietnam in February 2014. Pangolin meat, a delicacy, was easy to spot on restaurant menus in Hanoi. In an effort to curb demand, Education for Nature Vietnam also has posted banners in markets telling people that buying and selling pangolin scales is illegal and that the scales are ""not a magic medicine,"" said Doug Hendrie, the group's chief technical adviser. ""We've always focused on tigers rhinos and bears, and, now, organizationally we're really prioritizing pangolins, which is great,"" said Hendrie. Radio spots are in the works, as well. All of this was funded by the CNN reader donations, he said. The pangolin -- a scale-covered mammal that resembles an armadillo and rolls up into a ball when it's threatened -- is thought by conservationists to be the most trafficked mammal in the world. I reported on this little-known creature last year after CNN Digital readers voted for me to cover illegal wildlife trafficking as part of my Change the List project. The pangolin's celebrity has been increasing, as of late. Rovio, the maker of Angry Birds, featured them in a mobile game. And Prince William helped raise awareness about their plight in a November YouTube video. ""The humble pangolin, a scaly anteater, is one of the most endangered animals because of poaching,"" the prince said. ""The pangolin runs the risk of going extinct before most people have even heard of him."" Enforcement efforts also give cause for hope. This month, police in Zimbabwe arrested five pangolin poachers, according to WildAid. And in June, two tons of pangolin scales were seized in Hong Kong, according to that non-profit group. If the pangolin is saved, it will be in part thanks to those efforts -- and yours. For that I'm incredibly, genuinely, awesomely thankful. So here's another heartfelt thanks to those of you who contributed to Education for Nature Vietnam's anti-poaching PSA -- and who took time to read and care about this bizarre-but-important little animal. I hope this public service announcement opens minds, and that similar work is soon be taken up in China, which is researchers say is another large market for pangolin products.","John Sutter: Anti-poaching PSA airs in Vietnam because of CNN readers .

"(CNN)An attempt to mend the relationship between citizens and police in St. Louis broke into a shouting and shoving match late Wednesday -- between citizens and police. Council members considering a bill to establish a civilian oversight board over police work were holding a public meeting when Jeff Roorda, the business manager of the city's police union, and a woman appeared to get into a confrontation, an online video shows. The room erupted into shouts and profanity, as people rose to their feet and crowded in on the two. The bill was sponsored by Alderman Antonio French, an active participant in demonstrations that erupted in August in the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, after police Officer Darren Wilson, who is white, shot and killed unarmed African-American teen Michael Brown. A grand jury declined to file charges against Wilson, who resigned from the force. St. Louis police were investigating Wednesday night's scuffle. ""A police report with multiple complainants has been filed relative to the incident,"" said spokeswoman Schron Y. Jackson. ""There is an ongoing investigation to determine what occurred,"" she said. There were no arrests or injuries, she said Thursday. The meeting was packed. It was meant to seek public input into the creation of a civilian oversight body that can independently investigate police misconduct. For about an hour, the hearing went on without incident, as residents and police officers got up to speak in favor of or against the need for such a board. ""The alderman listened to their opinion and listened to our opinion. I thought the meeting was going really well,"" said Bishop Derrick Robinson, a Ferguson preacher and protest organizer who was at the meeting. Roorda disagrees. He said protesters shouted police down. ""About 30 or 40 anti-police radicals (were) fomenting violence against the police,"" he said. Roorda is a Missouri state representative and the business manager of the St. Louis Police Officers Association. He showed up at the meeting wearing a blue wristband reading ""I am Darren Wilson.""  And that didn't go over well with many of those present. Then Roorda stood up and called for order. ""Excuse me, first of all, you do not tell me my function,"" said Alderman Terry Kennedy, who was chairing the committee that called the hearing. Things quickly got out of hand. On Thursday morning, Roorda told CNN he wore the wristband because ""I have a right to freedom of speech, expression, just as violent protesters in Ferguson, who attempted to kill and maim police every night."" ""They were defended as exercising freedom of speech. ... I think I can wear a bracelet to a public meeting,"" Roorda said. French acknowledged Roorda's rights but said his action did the opposite of trying to bring the community together. ""He showed it to the protesters in the front row. He tried to provoke a response. He succeeded,"" French said of Roorda. What triggered the scuffle depends on whom you ask. One witness, Cachet Currie, told CNN affiliate KMOV that Roorda, in trying to get to Kennedy, ""jumped out into the aisle and pushed me over."" ""I got caught in whatever Roorda and Kennedy had going on,"" she said. ""I said, 'Wait a minute, don't push me.'"" The video shows some scuffling with a female. It does not show how the altercation started. Roorda said he was the victim. ""I tried to approach the podium and the anti-police radicals started pushing and shoving the police officers and myself,"" he said. The two sides then went at it. ""We went to protect her (the woman) and the police tried to protect him. And it was an all-out shoving match with some punches being thrown, too,"" said Robinson, the Ferguson preacher. After several minutes, the meeting was quickly adjourned. ""I think there were a few injuries but nothing serious, no ambulances called,"" Roorda said. ""We didn't see anyone get arrested."" French, the bill's sponsor, placed the blame on Roorda, calling his behavior ""deplorable."" But he also bemoaned the tensions in the city. ""We saw once again tonight how fractured our city remains. We have a lot of work to do,"" he tweeted. ""I believe a strong civilian review board can help."" CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","Police are investigating, say ""a police report with multiple complainants has been filed""

"A judge in California has sent a strong message to anyone who thinks that pointing lasers at aircraft is just harmless fun 'n' games. U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson sentenced a 19-year-old man on Monday to 30 months in federal prison for shining a laser pointer at a plane and police helicopter, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney's Office, which prosecuted the case. Adam Gardenhire deliberately pointed the commercial grade green laser at a private Cessna Citation that was landing at the Burbank Bob Hope Airport in California on March 29, 2012. Gardenhire, of North Hollywood, California, was arrested and pleaded guilty in the incident as part of an agreement with prosecutors in October. FBI: 'Epidemic level' of laser attacks on planes in U.S. The pilot of the corporate jet was hit in the eye multiple times and had vision problems through the next day, court documents say. Later, a helicopter sent by the Pasadena Police Department to investigate the incident also was again hit by a laser, but the pilot had protective equipment and was not injured. In court documents, his attorney argued he did not intend to put anyone at risk. ""Gardenhire had no idea that the deceptively ordinary laser he had borrowed from a friend was powerful enough to be seen by, much less distract, a pilot thousands of feet away,"" wrote attorney Sean Kennedy. Gardenhire is the second person indicted under the new federal law making it a federal crime to target aircraft with lasers, according the U.S. Attorney's office. In 2005, there were fewer than 300 incidents where planes were targeted, but that number grew by more than 12 times to nearly 3600 in 2011, according to the FAA. ""Shining a laser into the cockpit of an aircraft is not a joke,"" the agency's former administrator, Randy Babbitt, said in 2011 announcing a crackdown. ""These lasers can temporarily blind a pilot and make it impossible to safely land the aircraft, jeopardizing the safety of the passengers and people on the ground."" The FAA attributes the massive increase in incidents to laser pointers being more widely available online, stronger power levels, and an increase in green lasers which are easier to see, as well as better reporting of the incidents by pilots.","Adam Gardenhire, 19, gets two and a half years in federal prison .

"Washington (CNN)One New York City luncheon is getting more spice than usual and it has nothing to do with the menu.

"Fort Campbell, Kentucky (CNN) -- Ann Campbell and Marla Schroeder dub each other ""battle buddies,"" although they've never gone to war. Between them, they have 45 years in the U.S. Army. They're the wives of the top commanders of the 101st Airborne Division. ""Our husbands look after each other, and we look after each other,"" says Ann Campbell, the wife of Maj. Gen. John Campbell, the commanding general of the Combined Joint Task Force 101.  ""We always joke that being an Army wife is actually the toughest job in the Army."" Their job has become even more important this year. This summer, the base has seen the highest three-month death toll in Afghanistan since the war began. Forty-two soldiers from the 101st were killed during the months of June, July and August. Another six soldiers have died in battle in September. Roughly 17,000 soldiers from the 101st -- nearly the entire division -- are deployed as part of the surge in Afghanistan. ""We've had a very tough couple of months here in Afghanistan with casualties,"" Maj. Gen. Campbell tells CNN from Afghanistan. ""I tell you we've got a very resilient force in our soldiers and we have very resilient families. ... And I'm just thankful to be a part of it."" On this day, Ann Campbell and Marla Schroeder -- whose husband is Division Command Sgt. Maj. Scott Schroeder -- have come to a three-hour Family Readiness Group seminar to prepare other wives for the year ahead: how to stay strong, how to communicate with each other, how to maintain calm when the one you love most is not around. ""We can be there and bolster each other up and get through the hard times together,"" the general's wife says. ""We want to make sure our families have all the tools and resources they need to be resilient during these back-to-back deployments they've all experienced."" Marla Schroeder slips through the crowd and scoops up a fussy baby from her mother. The baby coos. Schroeder beams. Sometimes, pitching in can be as simple as cradling someone else's baby. ""We want grandchildren, but no time soon,"" she says, holding up the baby for all to see. ""She's beautiful!"" Behind her is a sign: ""FRG is not a disease!"" The two have known each other for more than a decade, meeting first when they were Cub Scout leaders for their oldest sons' troops. Schroeder smiles when she talks about her battle buddy. ""Working with her is just a phenomenal thing,"" she says. ""I am overwhelmed every day. She's great."" Schroeder says she's an ""easy cry"" and that Campbell helps her get through those rough days. When she's at airports and sees soldiers get handshakes from civilians, the tears come again. ""I get teased a lot about my invisible T-shirt that says, 'Please ask me about my husband.' He just embodies the American soldier."" Both of their husbands will be in Afghanistan for the next year, along with their fellow soldiers. Ann Campbell's husband, the commanding general, is on his third deployment. He served one tour in Iraq and is now on his second tour in Afghanistan. She says it's important for spouses to have battle buddies. ""Those are the folks you lean on,"" she says. ""Stay strong, stay in touch with the Army family. Wrap arms around each other.""

No, because every month he is gone I am that much stronger. I have that much more stuff in my kit bag."" Her oldest son also serves in the Army. She has two teens at home. She stays busy running them around to soccer practices; one just got his driver's license and the other is learning to drive. ""My husband picked a great year to go away,"" she says with a laugh.

"NEWARK, New Jersey (CNN) -- An FBI analyst and former vice presidential aide was sentenced Wednesday to 10 years in prison for espionage after he admitted supplying classified documents to Philippine nationals in an effort to overthrow that country's government, federal prosecutors said. Leandro Aragoncillo, 48, a former U.S. Marine and Philippine native who worked as a military aide to Vice Presidents Al Gore and Dick Cheney before joining the FBI as a civilian employee, pleaded guilty to four charges of espionage in May 2006. The plea deal spared Aragoncillo from facing the death penalty, prosecutors said. In a sentencing hearing Wednesday morning, U.S. District Judge William H. Walls sentenced Aragoncillo to 10 years in prison for his involvement in a plot to overthrow Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. In addition, he fined Aragoncillo $40,000. Aragoncillo could have been sentenced to up to 20 years for participation in a conspiracy to transmit national defense information, prosecutors said. U.S. Attorney Christopher J. Christie, in a news release issued Wednesday, accused Aragoncillo of ""betraying his Marine uniform, his adopted country and the trust bestowed on him as an FBI analyst."" Michael Ray Aquino, a co-conspirator, was sentenced by Walls on Tuesday to six years in prison. Aquino, 41, is a former Philippine national police officer who pleaded guilty in July 2006 to taking classified documents, obtained from Aragoncillo, and passing them on to Philippine officials plotting to overthrow Arroyo. Aragoncillo, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was arrested along with Aquino on September 10, 2005. Mark Berman, an attorney for Aquino, said that his client admits receiving documents from Aragoncillo, but maintains that he did not know the information was classified. Prosecutors say that Filipino recipients of the classified documents included former President Joseph Estrada, who was ousted six years ago; Sen. Panfilo Lacson, an opposition politician; and former House Speaker Arnulfo Fuentebella. ""I never intended to cause harm or injury to the United States,"" Aragoncillo told the judge. Aquino's attorney said his client was ""relieved"" that the court rejected the government's recommended sentence of 10 years in favor of a lighter penalty.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Skeletal remains found in a remote area of Malibu Canyon on Monday are those of Mitrice Richardson, a California woman who disappeared last year, Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca said Thursday. Richardson, 24, was last seen leaving a sheriff's station in Malibu after being detained by sheriff's deputies on a citizen's arrest complaint made by a restaurant manager in September. ""We have no indication of a homicide at this point,"" Baca said. ""I don't believe that the remains are capable of telling us a story."" The remains, which included a human skull, were found Monday by park rangers searching the area for marijuana groves, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore. ""It's incredibly treacherous terrain,"" Whitmore said of the remote site. ""There is no road, no trail even if you know exactly where you are going."" Whitmore describes the terrain while families wait for word . The woman's father reacted angrily after watching the sheriff's news conference from the rear of the room. ""Now you guys are going to see the real Michael Richardson come out,"" Michael Richardson said. Richardson said he was holding sheriff's deputies responsible for his daughter's death, either because of negligence or criminal intent. ""Why can't I speculate? Maybe the sheriff had something to do with it,"" Richardson told reporters. Mitrice Richardson was taken to the sheriff's station after she was unable to pay her $89.51 food and drink tab at a Malibu restaurant on the evening of September 16, 2009. A restaurant employee told the 911 dispatcher that she was ""sounding crazy."" After deputies determined she had no money to pay, the manager lodged a citizen's arrest complaint against Richardson. Her car was towed, and she was taken to the sheriff's station. Richardson was given a court date and released just after midnight, but her car was still impounded with her cell phone inside it, according to an investigation conducted by an independent commission. ""Based on my daughter's mental condition that night, she wasn't able to fend for herself,"" Richardson said. ""Mel Gibson gets driven to his car, and Charlie Sheen gets taken to his house."" Her family has said the college honors graduate and former beauty queen suffered from mental health issues. ""The deputies acted properly, but properly doesn't necessarily mean that we couldn't do something more,"" Baca said Thursday. One change may be in how deputies handle citizen's arrest complaints from businesses, he said. ""Is an $89 bill enough to take someone into the jail? There is more than one way to handle a problem,"" Baca said. Her father wants more than a policy review by the county. Richardson called for a state law named after his daughter to prevent it happening again to someone else. ""I guarantee you the Mitrice Richardson law will say no one -- man, woman or child -- will be released in Malibu for some predator that wears a five-star badge to attack or do whatever they want."" he said. Richardson said he was suggesting it might have been the work of ""someone in law enforcement."" ""It's clearly a set up by someone,"" he said. The independent review released Thursday said Richardson's mother, Latice Sutton, ""was vacillating on whether to let Ms. Richardson spend the night in jail so that she could learn a lesson; however, she made it clear if Malibu/Lost Hills personnel were going to release Ms. Richardson that night, Ms. Sutton would travel there to pick her up."" Mitrice's mom angered by leaks . Her mother did not learn she was released until 5:30 a.m. the next day, it said. She then filed a missing persons report, which began the search for Richardson that did not end until this week.

"A transgender woman prohibited from competing in a strength competition as a female is suing the fitness company sponsoring the competition, seeking $2.5 million in damages. Chloie Jonsson, a personal trainer, charges the CrossFit company with discrimination, intentional infliction of emotional distress and unfair competition in a lawsuit filed Thursday in Santa Cruz, California. While her lawyer calls it a case of discrimination against transgender people, CrossFit's lawyer calls it protecting the competition. Last year, Jonsson sought to compete in the CrossFit Games, a contest aimed at determining the fittest man and woman. According to the lawsuit, Jonsson has identified herself as a female since her teenage years and is legally recognized by California as a woman. She had sexual reassignment surgery in 2006 and has been on female hormone therapy, according to her lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges that a CrossFit teammate of Jonsson's sent an anonymous e-mail to the games organizers asking about transgender athletes in the competition. CrossFit determined that competitors in the event had to compete in the gender of their birth. Jonsson disagreed with its decision and the dispute has escalated to a lawsuit. CrossFit maintains that Jonsson was born as a male, so she should compete in the men's division, according to a letter from the company's lawyer to Jonsson's attorney. It also stated that the company had an ""obligation to protect the 'rights' of all competitors and the competition itself."" ""The fundamental, ineluctable fact is that a male competitor who has a sex reassignment procedure still has a genetic makeup that confers a physical and physiological advantage over women,"" according to the letter from CrossFit's lawyer sent in October. CNN reached out to CrossFit but did not get a response on Thursday. The letter from CrossFit was provided to CNN by Jonsson's attorney, Waukeen McCoy, who  blasted the company's decision. ""(Jonsson) doesn't have an advantage over other women. She's been on estrogen for such a long time,"" he said about his client. Hormone replacement therapy for transgender women includes anti-androgen therapy, which nullifies the effects of testosterone to reduce the masculine features of the body. Therapies can also consist of the hormones, estrogen and progesterone to feminize the body. Transgender men receive the opposite types of hormones -- mainly testosterone to masculinze their bodies with features such as increased muscle and hair growth. McCoy said that CrossFit should change its rules to be more like the International Olympic Committee, which allows transgender athletes to compete in their identified gender after undergoing sexual reassignment surgery. ""She's female,"" McCoy said about Jonsson. ""She's legally female. A corporation like CrossFit, they're doing business in California. The law precludes from discrimination on gender identity."" He said Jonsson seeks a reversal in the competition's policy. The lawsuit also alleges that CrossFit's policy of having to compete in a person's original birth gender, would require that transgender athletes would have to reveal their personal histories. In essence, that they'd have to ""out"" themselves, even if they sought privacy, the lawsuit alleges. After her sexual reassignment surgery, Jonsson changed all her records to reflect her sex change to female, including her birth certificate, according to her lawsuit.  Jonsson kept her background a secret and did not identify herself as transgender, according to the complaint. In a press release statement, Jonsson said: ""If I am going to be forced to out myself, I want it to be for the good for all transgendered people and athletes -- not because of a company's discriminatory policies.""","Fitness trainer sought to compete in 2013 CrossFit Games .

"(CNN)As the sun set Thursday in the Middle East, did two ISIS captives -- one a Jordanian pilot, the other a Japanese journalist -- fall with it? That was the question following a new message, purportedly from the terrorist group, that pushed Jordan to bring convicted terrorist Sajida al-Rishawi to the Turkish border by 5:30 p.m. (9:30 a.m. ET). If they didn't, according to the message, Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kassasbeh would be killed, followed soon thereafter by Kenji Goto of Japan. For days, Jordanian officials have said they're willing to swap al-Rishawi for al-Kassasbeh. Government spokesman Mohammed al-Momani reiterated as much late Thursday afternoon, about an hour before the purported deadline. He said Jordan is not about to pull off a deal yet, having received no proof that its pilot is still alive. ""We need a proof of life so we can proceed,"" the government spokesman said. If Jordan gets such proof and releases al-Rishawi, it is not clear whether that would mean Goto also goes free. Or al-Kassasbeh, for that matter. So the drama continues, with so much unsettled and so much on the line. Early Friday, Japan's foreign minister described the situation as ""still fluid and changing."" ""We need to continue to deal with this in a state of alert,"" Fumio Kishida told reporters. ISIS has shown its willingness to kill hostages before, the first being American journalist James Foley last summer and the latest being Haruna Yukawa, an aspiring security contractor from Japan reportedly killed last week. But is it willing to negotiate with governments that are fighting to stop its brutal, expansive campaign to expand what it calls the Islamic State? The drama is coming after the latest message posted by ISIS supporters, purportedly featuring Goto's voice. CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of the latest message, which was read by a person claiming to be Goto and posted online by ISIS supporters. Al-Momani said that ""the competent authorities (in his government) are still checking on the authenticity of the recent recording,"" state TV reported about two hours before the possible deadline. It follows another recording in which ISIS at first demanded $200 million to free Goto and Yukawa. A few days later, there was a new message -- this one with a man's voice claiming to be Goto, saying that the terror group was dropping its ransom request and instead demanding a swap of the Japanese journalist for al-Rishawi. In the third recording in this string, Goto purportedly gives Jordan 24 hours to release the convicted terrorist in ""exchange for my life."" Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh had said his country would release al-Rishawi if ISIS released al-Kassasbeh. Judeh has said that the Japanese journalist has not been forgotten. ""Of course,"" Goto's release would be part of a prisoner exchange, Judeh said. But the priority for Jordan, he made clear, is al-Kassasbeh's freedom. Who are those involved in this complicated crisis involving several countries? • Al-Rishawi is an Iraqi prisoner on death row in Jordan for her role in 2005 bombings. • Goto, an experienced war journalist, has been at the center of several threats by ISIS since his capture. Last week, the group demanded $200 million from Japan in exchange for Goto and fellow Japanese hostage Haruna Yukawa, an aspiring security contractor. Since then, ISIS has claimed Yukawa is dead, but Goto is still alive. • Al-Kassasbeh was captured by ISIS last month after the fighter jet he was flying crashed in Syria. ISIS says he's still alive, but Jordan's foreign minister told CNN his government has asked for a proof of life, but hasn't received it. They are not just captives, but people with loved ones desperately seeking their release. The 47-year-old Goto left Japan last fall, when his youngest of two daughters was a mere 3 weeks old. Now his family -- including his wife, Rinko, who heard from his captors first on December 2 and most recently in a Wednesday email with their ""final demand"" -- wants him back. ""My husband is a good and honest man who went to Syria to show the plight of those who suffer,"" she said in a statement released through the Rory Peck Trust, a nonprofit focused on freelance journalists. ""... ""I beg the Jordanian and Japanese government to understand that the fates of both (Goto and al-Kassasbeh) are in their hands."" Relatives of the Jordanian pilot -- captured after he ejected from his F-16 jet last month near Raqqa, the extremist group's de facto capital in Syria -- have also been outspoken, pressing officials in Amman to do all they can to secure his release. ""I firmly ask whomever has sent Moaz to fight outside the borders of Jordan, on a mission unrelated to us, to make strong efforts to bring back Moaz,"" the captive's father, Safi al-Kassasbeh, said Tuesday, adding that he believes his son's situation and Goto's shouldn't be mixed up. Safi al-Kassasbeh made his case again Thursday evening, after the sunset deadline had passed. ""I ask you in the name of God and his Prophet and all the believers and the names of tens of millions in Jordan and Palestine, in kindness, to release my son and the son of all Jordanians, who is your brother in the Islam religion and because forgiveness is a message of the Prophet,"" he told reporters. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali, Jomana Karadsheh, Kareem Khadder, Caroline Faraj, Yoko Wakatsuki, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Will Ripley, Junko Ogura, Ben Brumfield and Karen Smith contributed to this report. Journalist Hadeel Ghanboun also contributed to this report.","Captive Jordanian pilot's father pleads for his release .

"One casualty of the massive protests that have rocked Hong Kong since the end of September may have been the city's relationship with its police force -- traditionally one of the region's most well-regarded. With the use of tear gas to disperse crowds in the protests' early days to the videoed beating of a cuffed demonstrator by plain clothes police officers in early hours of Wednesday, the events of the past three weeks may have put the reputation of Hong Kong's finest beyond repair. Since an overhaul designed to weed out corruption in the 1970s, the city's police have been a relatively benign influence in the city. Following the 1997 handover of sovereignty to China, the force has peacefully monitored dozens of large-scale protests and sit-ins. However, the scale of the protests has caught the police arguably unprepared, with their tactics changing rapidly. Police initially took an aggressive stance towards the protesters — letting loose pepper spray and tear gas and donning riot gear.  But they later eased off, allowing protesters to occupy major highways uncontested and forming a human barricade to protect demonstrators from angry mobs of pro-government counter-protesters. However, the pendulum has swung back the other way over the past few days, with the re-emergence of pepper spray and batons, and a video showing a number of police officers dragging a handcuffed man to a secluded area before apparently kicking and punching him while others stand around, appearing to keep watch. The video has stunned many in the former British colony, and the authorities have pledged to launch an independent investigation. ""Police express concern over the video clip showing several plainclothes officers who are suspected of using excessive force,"" said a statement issued by the Hong Kong Information Services Department Wednesday morning. ""The Complaints Against Police Office has already received a relevant complaint and will handle it in accordance with the established procedures in a just and impartial manner."" Hong Kong's Secretary of Security Lai Tung Kwok told reporters the ""officers involved will be temporarily removed from their current duties."" He declined to take questions. Tear gas . The use of 87 rounds of tear used by police on September 28 marked the first time it has been used in Hong Kong since 2005, when South Korean farmers took to the streets to demonstrate against a World Trade Organization summit. But its use backfired, bringing swathes of Hong Kongers out to demonstrate in solidarity. ""In international standards, tear gas is only used when there is violence or when people set fire to cars or stores, and not (on) peaceful protesters,"" Craig Choy, a spokesperson for the Hong Kong Civil Liberties Union (HKCLU), told CNN. Many protesters are young students who did not expect the police to escalate their response so rapidly. ""I felt really shocked when I knew that the police were using tear gas,"" said Glacier Kwong, a student activist who was on the scene and felt the full effect of the police's attempts to disperse protesters on September 28. ""Pepper spray is already bad enough and then suddenly they used tear gas against protesters who were not attacking anyone. I was really shocked and very scared."" She says she panicked when the clouds of gas enveloped her. ""I couldn't breathe, my throat was so painful and I couldn't see properly. I still went down (to the site the following day). It didn't change my determination."" The police have denied that they have been heavy-handed. ""Police are facing an unprecedented challenge,"" Steve Hui, a department spokesman, said during a press conference. ""We have exercised maximum tolerance. The goal is to not provoke even more resentment and negative emotion among demonstrators."" Police actions bring in more protesters . Indeed, when police have deployed more aggressive tactics, they have had far from the desired effect. Instead of scattering the crowd, social media and TV spread news of the attacks, prompting thousands to flock to the protest site. There is a ""breach of trust"" between the public and the police, the HKCLU's Choy says, citing the example of one standoff outside the government headquarters earlier this month, when protesters accused police of smuggling in non-lethal armaments. ""The police tried to bring weapons into headquarters. They told protesters they were only changing the shift ... but in the end they transported more weapons. So most protesters think that police always lie."" Acts of aggression . Advocates of the pro-democracy camp say that, on several occasions, the police failed to act to maintain public order, particularly when pro-government groups stormed the protesters' camps, tearing down tents, barriers and handmade signs, and getting into vocal -- and sometimes violent -- confrontations with demonstrators. On at least one occasion, pro-government supporters have sexually assaulted women at the protest sites as tensions boil over. ""Women and girls were among those targeted, including incidents of sexual assault, harassment and intimidation,"" human rights group Amnesty International said in a statement. ""The police inaction ... is shameful. The authorities have failed in their duty to protect peaceful protesters who came under attack,"" said Mabel Au, the director of Amnesty International Hong Kong. Police have rejected the accusations that they failed to keep order, calling them ""totally unfounded and extremely unfair to police officers who faithfully and diligently performed their duty at the scene."" Rumors . Rumors that people have been offered money to stir up trouble -- with many pointing the finger at Beijing -- at the protest sites have added to the sense of disillusionment with the police and the government. ""We got offered HK$500 (around $65) to go to Mong Kok, to tear down the signs and shout and make noise,"" the South China Morning Post (SCMP) quoted one youth as saying. ""They want us to make trouble so that the police have an excuse to stop the protest and arrest people."" Requests by CNN to the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office​ under General Office of the State Council​ in Beijing for comment were not responded to. Some analysts say that Beijing has worked hard to get the police and other government institutions on side. ""The police has been 'mainlandized' and fed a lot of propaganda,"" Willy Lam, an adjunct professor, at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told CNN. ""The political neutrality of the civil service, the police, the ICAC (an independent anti-corruption agency) is in jeopardy."" But one symbol of the protest -- a giant artwork based on a widely-disseminated photograph of a protester sheltering a police officer from the rain with an umbrella -- signals that Hong Kong's faith in its police may not be entirely lost. ""That picture is very meaningful. I aspire for freedom and peace, and that picture has shown that,"" its creator, an artist known as Milk, told the SCMP. ""It means that we care about everyone, even if 'everyone' is the police force.""","A video seeming to show a protester beaten by police has shocked Hong Kong .

"(CNN)Imagine putting wings on the White House and getting it to fly around the world. It's been done. That's basically Air Force One in a nutshell. Now the Pentagon has announced the next generation of this world-class icon will be a military version of the 747-8. For nearly 30 years, the current jumbo jet Air Force One has been a customized version of the 747-200B. The newer 747-8 is longer and more efficient than its older brother. Why is a new one necessary? ""It is time to upgrade,"" Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in a statement Wednesday. The difference between the civilian version and what the President will fly on: the commander in chief gets a plane that's tricked out with top-of-the-line parts and backup systems. And a lot of technology that's -- well -- classified. Related: What's new about the 747-8? Let's remind ourselves why the world is so fascinated with this flying technological marvel. For more than half a century, passengers aboard the U.S. presidential aircraft have been witness to American history. Consider the fact that all these things happened on an Air Force One: . -- President Kennedy's body was flown to Washington for burial. -- Lyndon Johnson was sworn in as president. -- LBJ let a reporter interview him in the plane's stateroom, while dressed only in a towel. -- The only woman ever to swear-in a U.S. president did so aboard Air Force One. -- President Richard Nixon became the first American president to visit China, where he historically opened the door to U.S.-Chinese relations. -- Air Force One served as President George W. Bush's command center during the first hours following the 9/11 attacks. One of the main goals for the new plane, the Air Force said, will be affordability. Although the plane is designed to be more fuel efficient than its predecessor a new 747-8 lists for around $368 million. Add all the presidential bells and whistles and the sticker price goes north rather quickly. The 747-8 is made in the U.S., which the Air Forced hinted was a plus. ""The Boeing 747-8 is the only aircraft manufactured in the United States (that), when fully missionized, meets the necessary capabilities,"" Wednesday's statement said. The four-engine Airbus A380 -- the world's largest airliner -- which is made in France, was thought by some to be Boeing's only competition for Air Force One. When will the President get a new jumbo jet? Hard to say. If everything goes smoothly, Boeing likely will work with the Air Force on hammering out a timeframe and production schedule. In December, Boeing had 36 unfilled orders for 24 passenger versions and 12 freighter models. From humble beginnings as a small, less than impressively outfitted plane during the FDR administration, to its current jumbo jet status, Air Force One has become a world-class icon representing power and privilege. Members of Congress, celebrities and advocates clamor for seats on it, to get rare access to the President -- arguably the most powerful person on the planet. The plane's well-known blue and white color scheme was largely created by legendary industrial designer Raymond Loewy and approved by JFK himself. Officially, the aircraft is only called Air Force One while a sitting president is aboard. The presidential fleet includes several aircraft, other than the two 747s, that from time to time carry the ""Air Force One"" call sign. The presidential helicopter is operated by the Marine Corps and is often seen ferrying the President to and from the South Lawn of the White House. It's called ""Marine One."" On the rare occasion the President travels by Army aircraft, that is known as ""Army One."" By the same logic, aircraft used to carry the vice president are given the call sign ""Air Force Two."" Over the years, the various ""Air Force Ones"" have had their fair share of Hollywood screen roles. For example, the technological wizardry onboard the present 747s got wide play in the 1997 Harrison Ford action movie ""Air Force One,"" in which the President's jet is hijacked by Russian nationalists. However, many of the more outlandish gizmos featured in the film owed more to, shall we say, artistic license than to airborne fact. The plane for example has no escape pod. Nor is it equipped with parachutes -- the massive slipstream created by an aircraft the size of a 747 means they can't be used. Designed to operate as independently as possible from ground services, the aircraft can fly halfway around the world without refueling. They carry their own automated baggage loaders as well as built-in front and aft stairs enabling them to operate self-sufficiently at airports and airfields around the world, minimizing security risks. Capable of in-flight refueling from airborne tankers, manufacturers say the aircraft has ""virtually unlimited range"" -- its passengers sustained by galleys capable of storing up to 2,000 meals at a time. The entire aircraft is shielded against the effects of electromagnetic pulse -- a wave of energy generated by the detonation of a nuclear device that can disable unprotected electronics. It  features private accommodation, office space and a workout room for the President, first lady and family; as well as accommodation and offices for support staff and security personnel. Also on board is a stateroom and conference rooms that can, should it ever be necessary, be converted into a fully functional airborne medical center.

"More than two months of pro-democracy protests that transformed the heart of Hong Kong's financial district could be coming to an abrupt end this week. Police have announced that they plan Thursday to clear the main protest camp, which sprawls along a multi-lane highway next to the city's government headquarters. Protest leaders say they don't intend to put up a fight, but it remains unclear if other factions in the decentralized movement will resist the police action. Public support for the student-led protests swelled in late September after police used tear gas and other tough tactics in a botched attempt to disperse demonstrators. The Umbrella Movement, as the demonstrations became known, made headlines around the world, prompting speculation about how the Chinese government, which has ultimate control over Hong Kong, would react. Losing public support . The protesters have held onto a big stretch of highway in the city's Admiralty district since then, populating it with rows of colorful tents, outdoor classrooms and art installations. But while support remains for the demonstrators' cause -- a call for Hong Kong to be able to choose its next leader from an open field of candidates -- enthusiasm for their methods has faded. In a poll in November, just 13% of Hong Kongers surveyed said the street occupations should continue. Divisions deepened between different groups of demonstrators last week after a failed attempt to surround the government headquarters led to clashes with police. The Chinese government has steadfastly rejected the protesters' demands, calling the movement illegal and letting Hong Kong authorities deal with the situation on the ground. Police and bailiffs to move in . Police are now taking advantage of a court injunction requested by a bus company that orders the clearing of some of the highways blocked by the protest camp. ""The illegal road occupations have lasted for more than two months, and the daily lives and livelihoods of the general public have been seriously affected,"" Assistant Police Commissioner Cheung Tak-keung said Tuesday. He said police would on Thursday assist bailiffs in clearing the areas covered by the court order and would then move to reopen the other blocked roads. They will also remove the much smaller protest camp in the shopping district of Causeway Bay ""at an appropriate time,"" he said. The police plan appears to spell the end of the street protests. Authorities dismantled the other key encampment, in the working-class district of Mong Kok, last month. 'The end of this phase' Leaders of the student groups that have spearheaded the demonstrations said they would remain at the Admiralty protest site but wouldn't physically resist the police. ""We will sit outside the injunction area. We will stay true to the spirit of civil disobedience -- remain peaceful and bear the legal consequences of our action,"" said Alex Chow, secretary general of the Hong Kong Federation of Students. Their final sit-in would ""mark the end of this phase of the occupation,"" Chow said Tuesday, according to the South China Morning Post, a local newspaper. Joshua Wong, the student figure who has become the face of the protest movement, has also urged protesters to remain peaceful. Wong, a leader of the student group Scholarism, abandoned a hunger strike at the weekend that was aimed at getting the Hong Kong government to hold talks with protesters. 'I'll let them arrest me' One protester at the site, Jerry Lam, said Wednesday that he planned to stay there until the police came. ""I'll let them arrest me if it comes to that, and I think everyone here in this camp feels the same,"" Lam, 24, told CNN as he folded up his tent. But another demonstrator, Gypsy Wong, 22, said she was packing up and wouldn't be there when the police came. ""Even if we resist, there's no use,"" she told CNN, remembering a night of clashes she witnessed earlier in the movement. ""I felt so helpless when the police were charging down upon us,"" she said. ""That night I cried, and I don't want to see that again."" Lam said that whatever happened, the clearance of the protest camp wouldn't erase ""the people's spirit."" ""Before the Umbrella Movement, Hong Kong people didn't really pay attention to politics. But now, everyone cares,"" he said. ""Our generation will pass this story onto the next generation, and they'll know what we did.""","Police say they plan to clear the main pro-democracy protest camp Thursday .

"(CNN)She may have been ill but that didn't stop Serena Williams from claiming a 19th grand slam title Saturday. The world No. 1 beat second-ranked Maria Sharapova 6-3 7-6 (5) in the Australian Open final to move into sole possession of second place in grand slams won in the Open Era behind Steffi Graf's 22. And on this form, matching Graf -- or surpassing the German -- shouldn't be discounted even if Williams turns 34 in September. ""I would love to get to 22,"" Williams told reporters. ""But I have to get to 20 first and then I have to get to 21. There's so many wonderful young players coming up, so it will be a very big task."" The American defeated her Russian rival for the 16th straight time, although Sharapova ensured it was a gripping contest from start to finish. Indeed the finale between two of the most recognizable athletes in the world produced some riveting rallies, which hasn't always been the case when they've played due to Williams' superiority. ""It's frustrating to be the one going home with the small trophy,"" Sharapova told reporters. ""But I do love the battle. ""I love high-quality tennis. I love being part of it. It's a lot better than watching it on TV."" A gutsy Sharapova saved match points in two different games with punishing forehands, both players took turns uttering shouts of ""come on"" -- Williams was penalized in the second set for yelling out in celebration when a point wasn't over -- and despite not being fully fit, Williams covered the court with aplomb. A 12-minute rain delay in the first set -- during which Williams vomited off court -- forced organizers to close the roof on Rod Laver Arena and with conditions subsequently perfect for serving, it boosted Williams' already potent delivery. ""I also started serving better in the second set because I knew if I wasn't having my ground strokes where I wanted them to be, I knew I could serve it out,"" Williams said. Fifteen of her 18 aces, including one to wrap up the nearly two-hour contest, came in the second. ""When the games on her serve were 30-all, 40-30 or 15-30 a few times, she came up with really great serves,"" Sharapova said. ""There's a few, just very limited amount of players that serve in that speed range as she does consistently. ""She finds the corners extremely well."" Williams, who suffered from a fever and cough all this week, set the tone by breaking in the first game. She took control of the first by winning six straight points following the rain delay to build a 5-2 advantage. But Sharapova, one of the game's best competitors, didn't melt in the second set. She matched and even surpassed Williams from the baseline. Sharapova saved one match point trailing 5-4 and the other at 4-6 in the tiebreak after saving two match points in the second round. Another escape act wasn't on the cards, however. With Williams finally holding match point on her own serve, she thought she hit an ace out wide. A let was called. No matter. She reloaded and hit an almost identical serve to see off Sharapova. The pair haven't always gotten along -- Sharapova's current boyfriend, men's pro Grigor Dimitrov, is believed to have formerly dated Williams -- but a warm handshake ensued. Williams maintained her record of never losing past the quarterfinals in Melbourne, improving to 12-0. Besides suffering another defeat to Williams, Sharapova failed in her bid for a sixth major and first outside Roland Garros in seven years. ""I haven't beaten her in a really long time but I love every time I step on the court to play against her because she's been the best and as a tennis player you want to play against the best,"" Sharapova said. ""I was almost down and out in the second round and I feel like I gave myself a second life in this tournament and gave myself an opportunity. It wasn't quite enough today but I'm proud of my effort and couple of weeks here."" In Sunday's men's final, top-seed Novak Djokovic faces sixth-seed Andy Murray.

"(CNN)It's one of the most eagerly awaited days of the football calendar with one former legend calling it for be made a public holiday -- but why is this year's transfer deadline day turning into a damp squib? Transfer deadline day marks the end of the period in which clubs are allowed to sign players -- meaning that once the window 'slams shut' at 11pm GMT, no further business can be done. There are two windows in each year -- one beginning on July 1 and ending on August 31 and the other starting on January 1 and finishing on the final day of the month unless that day falls on the weekend as it does on this occasion. While most of the business is done during the month long period, the frenetic nature of deadline day means some clubs are left waiting until the final minutes to get their deals done -- leading to masses of excitement, cynicism and often disappointment from fans across social media. Supporters stay up late in front of the television awaiting the very latest news from their respective clubs with hopes for a last minute superstar signing becoming increasingly desperate. But this year's deadline day has been one of the quietest in recent years. Last season's January transfer window was noticeable for several big deals including Juan Mata's $56million move from Chelsea to Manchester. Chelsea spent $32million on midfielder Nemanja Matic on top of bringing in Kurt Zouma and Mohamed Salah. But heading into the final day of the transfer window period, the gross spending of the 20 Premier League clubs stood at £80m ($120m). Manchester City's signing of Wilfried Bony from Swansea for a fee reported to be in the region of $38 million is the biggest of the transfer window in England so far. Arsenal spent around $17m on Gabriel Paulista, the Brazilian defender from Villarreal, while Leicester coughed up $13.5m for Croatia forward Andrej Kramaric. ""While the summer window saw a record level of transfer spending, so far we have seen spending in January being slightly more reserved,"" said Dan Jones, Partner in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte. ""However, 2014/15 is still a record season for Premier League spending, with clubs having spent over £900m, significantly ahead of the previous record of £760m. ""This level of spending has been made possible in large part through the broadcast revenue Premier League clubs enjoy. With all 20 Premier League clubs now ranked in the top 40 globally by revenue, we continue to see them use their increased resources to invest in playing talent in the January window."" In England, the clubs facing relegation from the world's richest league have been reluctant to throw money at the problem in a bid to ensure survival. There have been a number of loan deals completed but actual transfers are in scarce supply. ""I think the surprising thing is that it's quiet at the lower end of the table,"" Tor-Kristian Karlsen, former Monaco chief executive and Norwegian football scout, told CNN. ""It's so tight down there and it's the last opportunity to do something which can make a great difference. There's a lot of money and prestige at stake. ""For the top clubs it's trickier because you don't want to buy players who can't play in European Champions League. ""For Manchester United, I don't think players currently playing in the Champions League would come and play for them at the moment."" The window will also close hours before February 3 in France, Italy and the Netherlands. In Spain, where the window closed on Friday, clubs spent $79.5 million during the transfer window up from $53.7 million at the same time last year. Real Madrid's signing of Brazilian midfielder Lucas Silva from Cruizero for a fee believed to be in the region of $14.5 million and Norwegian wonderkid Martin Odegaard took the headlines.","February 2 is transfer deadline day in the English Premier League .

"(CNN)Equatorial Guinea stunned Tunisia by coming from behind to secure a famous, unexpected and bad tempered 2-1 victory and reach the semifinals of the Africa Cup of Nations. Amongst a hail of atrocious tackles and off-the-ball incidents, Tunisia took the lead when Ahmed Akaichi swept home midway through the second half. But a controversial penalty decision in injury time handed Equatorial Guinea a lifeline. Spain-born striker Javier Balboa, who was once on Real Madrid's books, scored and sent the game into extra time and towards an ecstatic, and violent, conclusion. Tunisia's players could scarcely believe what was happening. Punches were thrown behind the referee's back as play acting ruined the game's fluency. Free kick . The referee again awarded a controversial free kick in the first half of extra time but there was nothing controversial about what happened next. Balboa stepped up again and incredibly curled the ball into the top corner to give the hosts a shock 2-1 lead. The game degenerated into a flurry of conflicts, fights and faked injuries. The referee blew the final whistle a full 15 seconds before the end and had to be escorted down the tunnel by armed police as Tunisian players and officials chasing him down the tunnel, marring what ranks as the finest moment in the country's soccer history. Long shots . The hosts are ranked 118th in the world by FIFA and were not scheduled to even compete in the tournament. Equatorial Guinea had initially been thrown out of qualification in the first round back in May 2014 after fielding an ineligible player. Several matches during their attempt to qualify for the 2014 World Cup were also awarded to the opposition for the same reason. But the Ebola crisis that has engulfed west Africa led to fears in Morocco, the original host country, that fans might bring the disease with them. After a lengthy saga, they eventually pulled out at the last minute. Equatorial Guinea, who co-hosted in 2012, stepped in and were reinstated. Denmark '92 . The build up to the tie had seen the hosts evoke the spirit of the Denmark national team of the early 1990s. Denmark failed to qualify for the 1992 European Championships but after Yugoslavia were ejected due to the civil war raging in their country, the Danes were given a free pass into the tournament. They went on to win it. ""We have the will to win and we like the challenge in front of us. We are hungry for victory,"" Equatorial Guinea's coach Esteban Becker said in a press conference earlier in the tournament. ""Denmark were instated in the 1992 European Championship at the last minute and they went on to win it. We want to do that too."" Yet that Denmark team, although in decline, was still considered to be one of Europe's most cultured teams. Equatorial Guinea were one of the lowest ranked teams in the Africa Cup of Nations. They will now play the winner of Ghana and Guinea, who play Sunday. Congo v Congo . The Democratic Republic of Congo also made it to the semifinals after a dramatic 4-2 victory over Congo. With the game tied 0-0 at  half time there appeared to be little danger of a six-goal thriller. But the game burst into life in the second half. Congo raced into a 2-0 lead before a stunning comeback saw the Democratic Republic of Congo score four times without reply. They will now play the winner of Ivory Coast and Algeria, who also play Sunday.","Equatorial Guinea stun Tunisia .

"(CNN)He won the Champions League and is his country's all-time leading goal scorer, but this isn't a story about a famous footballer rather a man who has almost single-handedly transformed the fortunes of handball in his homeland. France's Jérôme Fernandez may not be a household name outside his sport, but his achievements on court put even those of his twinkle-toed compatriot Thierry Henry in the shade. With more than 375 international caps and a goal tally for France nearing 1,500, Fernandez has been a colossus for both country and his various clubs in a career spanning almost two decades. During spells with sides in France (Montpelier and Toulouse), Spain (Barcelona and CF Ciudad Real) and Germany (THW Kiel), Fernandez has won numerous club titles, including the Champions League (twice), the sport's equivalent of football's premier European club competition. But it is on the international stage where Fernandez has made his most enduring impact winning three World (2001, 2009, 2011) and European (2006, 2010, 2014) titles and Olympic gold medals at the last two games in Beijing 2008 and London in 2012. ""The best memory in my career and for my sport was the Olympics Games in Beijing, because it was a title that changed the view of people in France about handball,"" Fernandez told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""Now it's famous, but before we only saw football or basketball on TV. Now, (handball) is one of the best sports in France."" When a 20-year-old Fernandez arrived on the international scene in 1997, France was beginning to emerge as a major force in handball. A bronze medal at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992 was followed by the country's first World Championship gold medal three years later. The solid foundations were rapidly built on as France assembled a series of world-beating teams which has in turn helped fuel handball's growing popularity among the French public. Handball might not rival the participation levels of football or tennis -- the former has around two million licensed players in France, the latter just over one million -- but the sport has seen numbers rise steadily in recent years with participation up by almost a third -- France's Ministry of Sport estimated there were just under half-a-million registered players in 2012. Played on courts measuring 40 x 20 meters (roughly a quarter larger in size than a basketball court), handball teams are made up of seven players -- one goalkeeper and six outfield -- with seven substitutes who can replace another player at any time during a game. A match lasts one hour (played in two 30-minute halves) and games are often combative and fast-paced with lots of goals -- around one a minute on average. ""If you want to play a contact sport with team spirit, you must play handball because I think it's one of the most complete sports in the world,"" Fernandez says. ""It's like rugby or American Football -- it's very physical but very tactical too. You need to be fit and play collectively as a team."" With sudden changes in tempo and end-to-end action there is much to keep crowds entertained, but it is goals that gets handball crowds going. The jump shot, which sees a player leap before unleashing the ball at speeds up to 125 kph (around 78 mph), is a spectacular climax to a long, drawn out tactical build-up and Fernandez is one of the game's greatest exponents, says German handball journalist, Bjorn Pazen. ""He looks a little bit skinny compared to other players but he has the power in his arms and he can jump,"" Pazen explains. ""He is famous for jumping over the defence players to score."" At six foot, six inches tall, Fernandez can leap higher than most, but in handball circles, much like basketball, he is no giant -- the sport attracts its fair share of seven-footers, with Latvia's Dajnis Kristopans currently one of the sport's biggest attractions. While Fernandez's prolific goalscoring might grab the headlines, it is his intelligence and leadership that have made the 37-year-old one of the top 10 players of all-time, says Pazen, who has watched the Frenchman's career develop over the past 14 years. ""Usually you get injured when you get hit really hard but he was always clever enough to make moves that nobody expected. You know, he's a very intelligent player in a very intelligent team,"" he says. ""When he comes in, in crucial matches like finals, everybody knows they can count on him -- he scores the goals or makes the crucial pass so that others can score. He is a leader but he's also a team player."" It came as no surprise that Fernandez took over as national captain in 2009 and soon led France to their third (his second) world title beating perennial rivals Croatia 24-19 in the final in Zagreb in February that year. ""This was a career highlight ... it was my first competition as captain -- for me it was the most important,"" he says. Fernandez and France are currently on course to be crowned world champions for a fifth time at the World Championships currently taking place in Qatar -- Pazen says they are ""big favorites"" at the biennial tournament. Clinching a fourth world title would be deeply satisfying for Fernandez, but not as rewarding as attending a fifth consecutive Olympics and the chance to equal another record in what would be his swansong in the sport. ""His big dream is to go to Rio to play and win the Olympic gold for a third time,"" Pazen says. ""Only Russian goalkeeper, Andrey Lavrov has won three Olympic gold medals in 1988, 1992 and 2000."" If he does travel to Brazil -- Pazen sees no reason why France would not pick him if he is fit -- then he has every chance of finishing his career on a golden high. But whatever happens in months ahead it looks like he'll never be too far away from the court in the years to come. ""I'm thinking about becoming a coach. All that I have learned in my career I want to give to the young players so they can reach for titles with the clubs and the national team. For me it is normal to help players. Handball is my sport, my passion and I want to give back.""","Handball star has helped guide France to unprecedented success .

"The French Senate approved a controversial bill Friday that would give same-sex couples the rights to marry and adopt. The lower house has already approved the legislation. The bill, to which 10 amendments were made in the Senate, must still go through a second reading in the National Assembly and a final reading in the upper house. The date for those readings has not yet been set. Minister for the Family Dominique Berinotti told CNN affiliate BFM-TV that the Senate vote was a ""beautiful victory."" Extending the rights to marry and adopt to same-sex couples in France was one of President Francois Hollande's electoral pledges in campaigning last year. The left, which includes Hollande's governing Socialist Party, dominates the National Assembly, where the bill passed by a large majority in February. The party has only a slim majority in the Senate. The plan faced stiff opposition from the Roman Catholic Church, other religious groups and social conservatives, with huge numbers turning out for protests in recent weeks. It won wide backing from gay rights advocates. The new law would mark the biggest step forward for French gay rights advocates in more than a decade. A law legalizing civil unions was introduced in 1999 in France under a previous Socialist government. Known in France as the PACS (pacte civil de solidarite), the civil union agreement can be entered into by same-sex or straight couples and confers many but not all of the rights of marriage.

"All four members of Motley Crue signed an agreement Tuesday that will permanently dissolve the legendary rock group after a final tour. Vince Neil, Mick Mars, Nikki Sixx and Tommy Lee appeared in a Hollywood hotel Tuesday for a signing ceremony for a ""cessation of touring agreement,"" which their lawyer said would bring a peaceful end to the group. ""Other bands have split up over rancor or the inability of people to get along, but this is mutual among all four original members and a peaceful decision to move on to other endeavors and to confirm it with a binding agreement,"" attorney Doug Mark said. Motley Crue has sold more than 80 million albums since hitting the road in 1981, but drummer Tommy Lee said, ""Everything must come to an end.""
