"(CNN) -- An Irish bishop resigned Wednesday following a government report into the sexual abuse of children by Catholic clergy -- the second to do so. Bishop Jim Moriarty was not directly criticized in the Murphy Report, but was a member of the Dublin archdiocese leadership for more than a decade before it put proper protections for children in place, he said. Moriarty said he ""should have challenged the prevailing culture"" of protecting the church rather than children when he was an auxiliary bishop in Dublin from 1991 to 2002. ""I know that any action now on my part does not take away the suffering that people have endured,"" he said in a written statement. ""I again apologize to all the survivors and their families. I have today offered my resignation as bishop of Kildare & Leighlin to the Holy Father. I hope it honors the truth that the survivors have so bravely uncovered and opens the way to a better future for all concerned."" The Vatican had no immediate comment on the resignation. Moriarty has been a priest for 48 years, he said in the statement. ""I fully accept the overall conclusion ... that the attempts by church authorities to 'protect the church' and to 'avoid scandal' had the most dreadful consequences for children and were deeply wrong,"" Moriarty said after the government report came out last month. Bishop Donal Murray, the bishop of Limerick, resigned on December 17. Murray was named in the 720-page report that found the Archdiocese of Dublin and other Catholic Church authorities in Ireland covered up clerical child abuse from 1975 to 2004. Child sexual abuse was ""widespread"" then, the report found. The report by the Dublin Archdiocese Commission of Investigation, which was set up in March 2006 to look into the abuse allegations, did not say Murray was guilty of abuse but that he failed to report it. Murray was ""aware for many years of complaints and/or suspicions of clerical child sexual abuse in the archdiocese,"" the report found. It said he dealt ""badly"" with a number of complaints and suspicions of abuse, and that his failings in at least one instance were ""inexcusable."" Murray resigned under a canon law that requires bishops who have become unsuited for the fulfillment of their office to resign, the Vatican said. Pope Benedict XVI met with senior Irish bishops at the Vatican a week before Murray's resignation and said he was ""deeply disturbed and distressed"" by the report's findings. He promised that the Catholic Church would try to develop strategies to make sure the abuses don't happen again. CNN's Hada Messia in Rome, Italy, contributed to this report.","Irish bishop resigns after government report on sex abuse of children by Catholic clergy .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- One of the things I find frustrating about modern American life is we wait for someone else -- anybody else -- to solve whatever problem it is that's out there. Clark Howard says Best Buy should have lauded employees who ran after a shoplifter, not fired them. We see something and feel like it's not our job. It's the ""not in my silo"" mentality found in corporate America. But there are times we wait for help to arrive when we're the help we seek. Unfortunately, this mentality has seeped beyond corporate America into normal earthlings. Have you heard the story about Jared Bergstreser and Colin Trapp? These two Best Buy employees tackled a shoplifter they saw busting out of their Denver, Colorado-area store with stolen electronics. They wrestled the suspect to the ground at great personal risk. The perpetrator pulled out a knife and cut a manager before ultimately escaping, according to The Wall Street Journal. Bergstreser had been a three-year employee, while Trapp was on the job for less than a year. What did Best Buy do for these employees who showed such extreme loyalty? They fired them. A spokeswoman for Best Buy said the company won't comment on the terminations. However, she said the company's employees are aware of a policy of not pursuing shoplifters. Best Buy says the policy is in place for the safety of its employees.  Watch Clark reveal a Vegas vacation scam » . This case is not unusual. I am privy to a story about a separate incident that happened with a discount retailer. Again, a couple of guys I know who were employees tackled a shoplifter. The suspect then pulled out a gun and tried to shoot them. They managed to disarm the shoplifter after he fired and he was taken into custody. Did they get a reward or bonus from their employer? No, they were canned. I got some interesting reactions when I discussed these two stories in a pre-show meeting with my team. Somebody immediately piped up saying, ""Of course they have to fire them because of liability."" Liability?! One of my producers even called me a vigilante. After all, I'm the guy who chased down my own mugger on a Madrid subway train during a staff trip to Spain. In retrospect, what I did was really stupid because I could have gotten injured or worse. But my natural instinct just took over and I successfully recovered my wallet. The idea that we're supposed to stand by idly and allow people to steal from us or steal from an employer is something that I just cannot support. I think we have a responsibility to get involved. Otherwise, if you let a small number of lawbreakers get away with it whenever, then they get away with it over and over and over again. I could understand if Best Buy were so cowardly and afraid of a lawsuit that they felt these two employees should be sent to ""Best Buy re-education camp."" Fine. But to fire them for trying to stop a brazen criminal who was armed and dangerous and busting out of the store with electronics? I just don't get it. And remember, when Bergstreser and Trapp went after this person, there was no benefit for them, unlike my experience being mugged in Madrid. They were putting themselves in danger to protect their employer. You should be, if not rewarded for that, then at least not punished! I believe Best Buy is sending a terrible message by firing them. What do you think?","Howard says there are times we wait for help to arrive when we're the help we seek .

"(CNN) -- Florida authorities were searching Sunday for a 33-year-old man after his wife and five children were found dead in their Naples home. Mesac Damas pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor battery against Guerline Damas in June. The bodies of Guerline Damas, 32; Michzach, 9; Marven, 6; Maven, 5; Megan, 3; and Morgan, 11 months, were discovered Saturday, Rambosk said. Authorities have been unable to locate Mesac Damas, who possibly left the country Friday morning and may be in Haiti, Capt. Chris Roberts of the Collier County sheriff's department said Sunday at a news conference. ""We don't see at this point any indication of an individual out in the neighborhoods committing additional crimes or homicides, but certainly we will look at every opportunity,"" Collier County Sheriff Kevin Rambosk said at an earlier news conference. There had been a ""handful"" of domestic disturbance calls to police since 2000 involving the Damas couple, with the latest resulting in the arrest of Mesac Damas in January, Roberts said. Mesac Damas pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor battery against Guerline Damas in June, and Roberts said he does not think Mesac Damas served any jail time for the crime. ""We are still talking to people that knew the family and obviously the ultimate information we need is not so much what happened in the past but what happened when these people died,"" Roberts said. The six bodies were found Saturday at about 6:30 p.m., a day after police had visited the home to check on the family, Roberts said.  Watch why authorities are looking for Damas » . When a family member had not heard from a resident at the home, the family member asked authorities on Friday to do a welfare check on the house, Roberts said. Responding police knocked on the door but got no answer, he said, but officers saw no indications to arouse their suspicions. The following morning, the family member became more concerned and filed a missing persons report, which authorities took, Rambosk said. Later, authorities requested from property management a key to the house and an authorization to enter. ""When we did, we found the bodies of the individuals,"" he said. ""I can tell you that in no uncertain terms this is the most horrific and violent event this community has ever experienced. This is the worst of the worst."" He would not release the manner of death. Rambosk said authorities had recovered Mesac Damas' vehicle at Miami International Airport, and they believe that he left on a flight to Haiti on Friday. Roberts said collecting and processing evidence can take ""several days, if not weeks.""","Police believe Mesac Damas, 33, boarded a flight to Haiti on Friday morning .

"(CNN)  -- Authorities at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island nuclear plant were investigating what caused a weekend radiation leak that resulted in 150 workers being sent home, officials said Sunday. An airborne radiological contamination alarm sounded about 4 p.m. Saturday in the Unit 1 containment building, according to a statement from Exelon Nuclear, which operates the Three Mile Island plant near Middletown, Pennsylvania. The unit had been shut down since October 26 for refueling, maintenance and steam generator replacement, the company said. ""A monitor at the temporary opening cut into the containment building wall to allow the new steam generators to be moved inside showed a slight increase in a reading and then returned to normal,"" the company said. ""Two other monitors displayed normal readings."" Three Mile Island was the scene of the worst U.S. nuclear accident, a partial meltdown in 1979 that resulted in the plant's second reactor being shut down permanently. Tests showed the contamination in Saturday's incident was confined to the building itself, and none was found outside, Exelon said. There was no threat to public health and safety, but the workers were sent home because they could not continue until the area was cleaned, Bill Noll, Exelon vice president, said in the Saturday statement. One worker was found to have received 16 millirem of exposure, and others received lower levels of contamination. The annual occupational dose limit for workers at Exelon plants is 2,000 millirem, the statement said. Radiation exposure from a chest X-ray is about 6 millirem, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Although Noll said it was hoped work would resume at Unit 1 on Sunday, Exelon spokeswoman Beth Archer told CNN on Sunday it had not resumed, as the cause of the leak was still under investigation. Two radiation specialists from the NRC were scheduled to investigate Sunday. ""Numerous work activities were going on in the building at the time the alarm sounded, and Exelon engineers are working to determine the cause of the incident,"" the statement said. The March 1979 accident at Three Mile Island brought the nuclear industry to a standstill. The partial meltdown of Unit 2's nuclear core resulted in no injuries to plant workers or nearby community members, but it triggered changes in nuclear power plant operations and emergency planning and led to tighter oversight of the industry by the NRC. The Unit 2 reactor is permanently shut down and defueled, the NRC said. In 2001, FirstEnergy acquired it and contracted its monitoring to Exelon, which owns Unit 1. The companies plan to keep Unit 2 in ""long-term, monitored storage"" until the Unit 1 operating license expires, at which time both plants will be decommissioned, the NRC said. A new generation of nuclear reactors is being considered in the United States as environmental concerns have intensified about coal-fired power plants. CNN's Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.","Airborne radiological contamination alarm sounded at 4 p.m. Saturday .

"KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) -- Tibet's exile government said the death toll from protests in the Himalayan region over the past two weeks has reached about 140, but Chinese government restrictions have made it difficult confirm the number killed. People walk past burnt-out buildings in Lhasa on 16 March, 2008, after violent protests broke out. Chinese authorities have issued a much lower death toll and said most of those killed were ""innocent"" ethnic Han Chinese targeted by rampaging Tibetans. The Tibetan exiles published a list of 40 Tibetans they said are confirmed dead. Meanwhile, Tibetan exiles and monks protested for a second day outside of China's embassy visa office in Kathmandu, Nepal on Tuesday, resulting in 73 protesters arrested, Nepalese police said. Although police said they did not use force, protest organizers said as many as 12 people were hurt when police charged them with bamboo sticks.  Watch demonstrator in tears as monks arrested ». Protests involving Tibet also dogged the Olympic flame, which was lit in a ceremony Monday in Olympia, Greece. The torch is scheduled to be carried to sites around the world on its way to the Summer Olympics in Beijing, and Tibetan activist say they plan anti-Chinese protests along the way. Another group of about 50 Tibetan exiles in India began their own torch relay Tuesday with a symbolic ""Olympic"" flame that will end in Tibet on the day of the Summer Games' opening ceremonies in Beijing, The Associated Press reported. On Monday, Greek police arrested some of the protesters along the first miles of the torch relay, but the demonstrations were peaceful and police reported no injuries or scuffles. At one point, a Tibetan woman covered herself with red paint and lay on the ground, forcing the torchbearer to weave around her as other protesters shouted ""Flame of shame."" Students for a Free Tibet, a Tibetan exile group, said its protesters would challenge police as the flame moves through 23 cities on five continents before passing throughout China. Tibetan activists will follow it through ""London, Paris and everywhere else China's stained Olympic Torch goes,"" the group said. The group said the Chinese government ""will pressure other governments to silence peaceful protesters who expose the truth behind China's Olympics propaganda campaign."" ""The Chinese government's long arm has already extended to San Francisco, where Tibetans are being told they cannot protest along the Torch Relay route,"" the group said in a news release. Also Monday, five Tibetans were arrested for deadly arson attacks stemming from the anti-China riots that erupted this month, China's government announced. A Chinese Ministry of public security official said the suspects have confessed to two arson incidents that killed 10 people in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua. Ministry spokesman Shan Huimin said three female suspects were detained for a March 14 fire at a shop, in which five female sales assistants were burned to death, Xinhua reported. In the second case, two males were detained for setting fire to a motorcycle shop on March 15, which resulted in five deaths -- including an 8-month-old boy and his parents, according to Xinhua. Shan said the violence in Lhasa between March 14 and 15 also injured 242 police officers, according to Xinhua. However, Shan added, peace has been restored to the area. Clashes between anti-Chinese protesters in the Tibetan capital Lhasa and other cities broke out earlier this month, and Chinese officials blamed the Dalai Lama's followers for the violence. The Tibetan government in exile said at least 80 people were killed by police, but Chinese officials put the death toll at 13. E-mail to a friend .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- China's foreign minister Wednesday rejected criticism of its human rights record, accusing the United States of ""clinging to a Cold War mentality"" and ""practicing double standards."" Workers at the Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Fast Railway, a key project associated with the Beijing Olympics. Yang Jiechi was responding to questions about a State Department report released a day earlier that characterized China's human rights record as one of the most repressive in the world. The report was released five months before the Summer Olympic Games kickoff in Beijing. Although he chided the United States and other critics of its human rights record as ""making confrontation,"" Yang stressed that China is ""ready for dialogue with the United States, as long as it is done in an environment of respect and fairness."" Despite rapid economic growth and social change in China, the report said the ""authoritarian"" Chinese government ""continues to deny their citizens basic human rights and fundamental freedoms."" It also said there was an increase in forced relocations in Beijing, with people being thrown out of their homes to make way for Olympic projects. ""China's overall human rights record remained poor in 2007,"" it stated, citing tightening controls over religious freedom in Tibet and the Uyghur population. China announced Sunday that militants in Xinjiang's Uyghur Autonomous Region had planned to carry out two terror attacks, including one targeting the Olympics set to begin on August 8. China said it successfully thwarted both attacks. The autonomous region is home to about 19 million people, most of whom are Muslims and other minorities. Many of them oppose Beijing's rule. The State Department report also said China has increased its efforts to ""control and censor the Internet, and the government tightened restrictions on freedom of speech and the domestic press"" and bloggers. It cited a 20 percent increase over 2006 in convictions of citizens under what it called China's overly broad state security law that is often used to silence government critics. ""The government continued to monitor, harass, detain, arrest, and imprison journalists, writers, activists, and defense lawyers and their families, many of whom were seeking to exercise their rights under law,"" the report said. ""Individuals and groups, especially those deemed politically sensitive by the government, continued to face tight restrictions on their freedom to assemble, their freedom to practice religion, and their freedom to travel."" The report, issued annually, surveys the human rights record of more than 190 countries around the world.

"(WIRED) -- What's hot off the presses this week? Want an out-of-print book? With the help of Google, a machine may be able to print one for you. Any one of the more than 2 million books old enough to fall out of copyright into the public domain. Over the last seven years, Google has scanned millions of dusty tomes from deep in the stacks of the nation's leading university libraries and turned them into searchable documents available anywhere in the world through its search box. And now Google Book Search, in partnership with On Demand Books, is letting readers turn those digital copies back into paper copies, individually printed by bookstores around the world. Or at least by those booksellers that have ordered its $100,000 Espresso Book Machine, which cranks out a 300 page gray-scale book with a color cover in about 4 minutes, at a cost to the bookstore of about $3 for materials. The machine prints the pages, binds them together perfectly, and then cuts the book to size and then dumps a book out, literally hot off the press, with a satisfying clunk. (The company says a machine can print about 60,000 books a year.) That means you can stop into the Northshire Bookstore in Manchester, Vermont, and for less than $10, custom-order your own copy of Dame Curtsey's Book of Candy Making, the third edition of which was published in 1920 and which can only be found online for $47.00 used. Dane Neller, On Demand Books CEO, says the announcement flips book distribution on its head. ""We believe this is a revolution,"" Neller said. ""Content retrieval is now centralized and production is decentralized."" Neller said the deal was clearly about the long tail of books, a reference to Wired magazine's Editor-in-Chief Chris Anderson's theory that hits become less important when distribution costs drop. One of the main benefits, according to Neller, is letting local book stores compete with Amazon.com by reducing their need to have expensive inventory. Other current retailers include the University of Michigan Shapiro Library Building in Ann Arbor; the Blackwell Bookshop in London; the Bibliotheca Alexandrina in Alexandria, Egypt; the University of Alberta Bookstore in Edmonton, Canada; and Angus & Robertson Bookstore in Melbourne, Australia. The company hopes to sell 60 more printers in the next year, bringing the number of machines globally to about 90. On Demand Books suggests that book stores price the books at about $8, leaving retailers with a $3 profit after both Google and On Demand Books collect a buck-a-book fee. Google plans to donate its share to a yet-unspecified charity, which might be a reaction to its messy legal and public policy fight over a copyright settlement that covers books that are still in copyright. (All the books that are being added to On Demand Books repertoire in this agreement are out of copyright in the country where it will be printed.) Starting Sept. 29, Bostonians can stop in the privately owned Harvard Bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and have their books printed in front of them. Or they can order it over the phone and have the store deliver it -- by bicycle. There's a certain irony to that, too, according to Google spokeswoman Jennie Johnson, since the bookstore is right next to Harvard's library, one of the libraries that partnered with Google to turn its millions of books into an online library of the future. ""Most people can't get into the Harvard Library, but you can print their books next door,"" Johnson said. Or put another way, On Demand Books is betting that in the future, every old book will have 15 readers. What's of interest in these old books? Plenty, according to Google. One knitter discovered a long-lost book about knitting, and recreated the heirloom pieces and even built a loom from a long-lost design. Another reader, who works with subsistence farmers in Africa, currently uses PDFs of old farming techniques to teach still-relevant skills. Google already uses the public-domain books in search results, and users can read those books in full online and even download them as PDFs for free. Neither Neller or Johnson cared to speculate on how many of these books they expect to sell, but Johnson says some 80 percent of the public-domain books are looked at in a given month. Unfortunately, it's unlikely that the number of public domain books will grow larger anytime soon, since Congress added two decades to existing copyright protection in 1999. Copyright, which originally lasts about 14 years, now extends to the life of an author plus 70 years for newly created works. As for their quality? They feel like a typical paperback, and are printed using typical 20- or 24-pound paper, with heavier stock for the inkjet-printed cover, which currently all share one design. While turning bits back into paper seems a bit of a stretch for Google, Johnson said it fits with the company's goal of organizing the world's information. ""We think people should be able to find and read these books,"" Johnson said. ""We don't care how people end up reading them."" Neller said he'd love to see the day when Google Book Searchers can press a button next to a search result and find the closest local printer, but Google says that's a long way off. So for now, book buyers of the future who want to buy books from the past will need to walk to a bookstore -- or get Harvard Bookstore to use the bicycle, a 19th-century invention, to bring them a book printed with 21st-century technology.

"(CNN) -- Historical tensions and overreaction on the part of both Russia and Georgia contributed to a five-day conflict between the two in 2008, a European Union fact-finding mission concluded in a report released Wednesday. South Ossetian mourners at the grave of a relative killed in the conflict on the first anniversary in August 2009. ""The conflict is rooted in a profusion of causes comprising different layers in time and actions combined,"" said the report from the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia. ""While it is possible to identify the authorship of some important events and decisions marking its course, there is no way to assign overall responsibility for the conflict to one side alone. They have all failed, and it should be their responsibility to make good for it."" Georgia launched a campaign against South Ossetia, a Russian-backed separatist Georgian territory, on August 7, 2008. The following day, Russian tanks, troops and armored vehicles poured into South Ossetia and another Russian-backed breakaway Georgian territory, Abkhazia, advancing into Georgian cities outside the rebel regions. A total of about 850 people were killed on all sides, the report said, and untold numbers of others were wounded or went missing. About 100,000 civilians fled their homes, and about 35,000 have been unable to return. ""The fighting did not end the political conflict, nor were any of the issues that lay beneath it resolved,"" the report said. ""Tensions still continue. The political situation after the end of fighting turned out to be no easier and in some respects even more difficult than before."" Russia and Georgia each blamed the other for starting the conflict, and accused each other of a variety of offenses leading up to and during the fighting, including ethnic cleansing. Moscow has since recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent regions. But relations between Georgia and Russia are at an ""all-time low,"" the report notes. After five days of fighting, a peace deal was brokered by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, acting on behalf of the EU. An implementation effort followed on September 8. The report noted that the actions ""stood in contrast to the failure of the international community, including the U.N. Security Council, to act swiftly and resolutely enough in order to control the ever-mounting tensions prior (to) the outbreak of armed conflict."" Georgian armed forces shelled the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali the night of August 7. While that action was seen as the start of the armed conflict, ""it was only the culminating point of a long period of increasing tensions, provocations and incidents,"" the fact-finding report said. ""Indeed, the conflict has deep roots in the history of the region, in peoples' national traditions and aspirations as well as in age-old perceptions or rather misperceptions of each other, which were never mended and sometimes exploited."" Any evaluation of the conflict should take that into account, along with mounting tensions in the months and weeks leading up to it, the report said, as well as ""years of provocations, mutual accusations, military and political threats and acts of violence both inside and outside the conflict zone. ""It has to consider, too, the impact of a great power's coercive politics and diplomacy against a small and insubordinate neighbor, together with the small neighbour's penchant for overplaying its hand and acting in the heat of the moment without careful consideration of the final outcome, not to mention its fear that it might permanently lose important parts of its territory through creeping annexation,"" the report said. The fact-finding mission was established in December by the EU to investigate the conflict. It was headed by Heidi Tagliavini, a former United Nations special representative for Georgia. The EU said in a statement it welcomed the report and hopes its findings can contribute to future international efforts at ""preventive diplomacy.""","Report: A total of about 850 people were killed on all sides in five-day conflict .

"(CNN) -- It's bad enough to be sick and miserable. But adding insult to injury for many a patient is having to hack through a veritable jungle of often-confusing paperwork to make health insurance claims. Dr. Val Jones is part of a practice in Virginia that has lowered its fees and quit taking insurance. Consumers' frustrations with health insurance paperwork are well-known. But it's also a frustrating tangle for doctors and their staffs. AC360° correspondent Tom Foreman has a report about one innovative practice that has decided to take on the insurance paperwork monster -- by completely avoiding it. Dr. Val Jones joined a small practice, DocTalker Family Medicine in Vienna, Virginia, where the doctors do not even take insurance. They charge a simple, relatively low fee for each service. That's it. The doctors at DocTalker grew tired of seeing patients struggle with baffling insurance paperwork while both their health and wealth were on the line. ""They don't know why they're getting these questions asked,""  Jones said. ""They don't know what the forms mean. And ... their compensation is dependent on it."" This innovation has been good news for Carol ""Yogi"" Yogan of McClain, Virginia. She said she broke her wrist ice skating, and her insurance company initially told her that her injury would not be covered. After persistent effort, she eventually convinced them otherwise. The company paid. But Yogan is certain without her dogged efforts, her claim would have been forever lost in the ""paperwork jungle"" of the insurance trade.  Watch Yogan's struggle with bureaucratic red tape » . Yogi Yogan has pretty much lost all faith in insurance companies. She has enough insurance to cover a catastrophic illness, but for routine care, she's now going to that nearby fee-for-service medical office where Jones works. ""It's seamless,"" Yogan said. She knows precisely what she is getting and what it costs. Jones does not believe the insurance industry set out to cultivate the paperwork jungle. She thinks it just grew over time. But now that it is there, she suspects they are making so much money off of it, that there is no real incentive to clear it up. Former insurance industry executive Wendell Potter agrees. He said one way insurers make money is by allowing confusion to reign. ""And people often just give up,"" Potter said, ""and don't pursue payment when a claim has been denied or been paid inappropriately or not adequately. And the same is true with doctors and hospitals."" He believes billions of dollars are at stake. The insurance industry, while acknowledging the existence of the paperwork jungle, denies it is a trap for extra profits. Robert Zirkilbach is with a national trade association for insurers called America's Health Insurance Plans. ""The health insurance industry is one of the most regulated industries in America, and particularly at the state level there are all kinds of requirements of information that needs to be provided to patients in paper and through the mail,"" Zirkilbach said. But he adds, insurers are just as worried as customers about the confusion that causes. ""We agree that reform is needed. In fact, that's why we've been working very hard to develop reforms to make the system more efficient,"" Zirkilbach said. AC360° correspondent Tom Foreman contributed to this report.","Practice in Virginia has lowered and simplified its fees and quit taking insurance .

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Russian and British ships repelled a pirate attack on a Danish ship in the Gulf of Aden, the Russian navy said Wednesday. Pirates have caused havoc off the coast of Somalia, hijacking 33 ships this year. Elsewhere, pirates hijacked a Turkish-flagged ship carrying 4,500 tons of chemicals and 14 crew off Yemen's coast. The pirates hijacked the ship, Karagol, near Yemen as it traveled to Mumbai, India, semi-official news agency Anadolu Ajansi reported, citing a written statement from the Turkish Maritime Agency. Russian navy spokesman Igor Dygalo said the Russian patrol ship Neustrashimy and a British frigate, HMS Cumberland, successfully rebuffed pirate attempts to seize the Danish ship Powerful off Somalia. The British and Russians used helicopters to counter-attack the pirates, who had opened machine gun fire on Powerful and twice tried to seize it, Dygalo said. It was not immediately clear when the incident occurred. When asked about the incident, the British Ministry of Defense said a crew from the Cumberland had boarded a small boat on Tuesday that ""they ... believe had been involved in an attack on the Danish-registered MV Powerful earlier in the day."" Ahead of boarding the small boat, or dhow, the British crew members tried several ways to stop it, ""but they were unsuccessful,"" the Ministry of Defense's statement said. The Cumberland then launched boats to circle the dhow, in another attempt to halt it. People aboard the dhow opened fire at these boats, and the Cumberland's crew members returned fire, the statement said. Two alleged pirates were killed during the shooting. A third person, a Yemeni national, died later from injuries, despite care from the Cumberland's doctor, the Ministry said. ""It is unclear whether his injuries were as a result of the firefight or a previous incident."" The Gulf of Aden, which connects the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea, has become a treacherous stretch for ships, particularly along the Somali coast. There have been 84 attacks and 33 successful hijackings off Somalia's coast this year. Meanwhile, the Karagol is owned by Istanbul-based Y.D.C. Denizcilik, A.S. The company confirmed its ship had been hijacked, but could not provide any details. The Karagol is the second Turkish ship in two weeks to be hijacked. On October 29, pirates in the same area off Yemen commandeered the Neslihan, a Turkish-owned freighter, carrying 77,000 tons of iron ore from from Canada to China, the ship's owner, Ya-Sa Shipping Industry and Trading, S.A., said.

Martin Luther King Jr. to meet in their capacity as the sole shareholders of the corporation that manages their iconic father's estate. Dexter King has denied taking ""substantial funds"" from his parents' estates. King's children were in Fulton County, Georgia, Superior Court Monday in a dispute over their parents' estates. Two children of the civil rights icon are suing their brother, accusing him of wrongfully taking money from their parents' estates. The Rev. Bernice King and Martin Luther King III allege Dexter King took ""substantial funds"" out of Coretta Scott King's estate and ""wrongfully appropriated"" money from their father's estate. Dexter King has publicly denied the accusations. It was unclear what outcome having a shareholder meeting for the Estate of Martin Luther King Jr., Inc. would have on the dispute. The three siblings have not held such a meeting since 2004, corporation attorney Luke Lantta said. The removal of Dexter King as the estate's administrator is unlikely because that would require a meeting of the board of directors. Judge Ural Glanville on Monday also ruled in favor of dismissing some of the allegations against Dexter King, but left the question of whether he failed to act in the best interest of his father's incorporated estate to a jury. A trial on the allegation of breach of fiduciary duty could happen as early as next month. The lawsuit reveals a very public fissure in an iconic family that has always professed unity, particularly as questions have swirled around some of their financial dealings. Martin Luther King III and Bernice King were in the courtroom Monday, but Dexter King was not. He had been injured in an accident in California and did not make the trip to Georgia. Dexter King had filed a counter claim against his sister, asking the court to force her to hand over to the corporation some items that belonged to Martin Luther King Jr. In a special hearing Monday, the court ruled that the items, including Martin Luther King Jr.'s Nobel Peace Prize and his love letters to Coretta Scott King will be turned over to the court to hold until a resolution is reached. The courtroom was packed with supporters of the King family. Among those in attendance were the Rev. Joseph Lowery and former Ambassador Andrew Young, friends of Martin Luther King Jr. who worked with him during the civil rights movement.

"(CNN) -- Pope Benedict XVI ended 2009 much as he began it -- with a major gaffe that angered Jews. He started the year by welcoming a Holocaust-denying bishop back into the fold, and ended it by putting the controversial World War II-era Pope Pius XII one step closer to sainthood. Both caused uproars. ""It seems that the pope doesn't always know what's going out under his name, or the impact of what's going out under his name, which is very strange to observe because John Paul II was so media-savvy,"" said Ruth Ellen Gruber, a Jewish journalist and author who has long been based in Rome. The Pius XII episode ""seems to be yet again a case where they didn't estimate what the response would be,"" Gruber said. In both cases the pope quickly found himself having to explain and clarify. He lifted the decades-old excommunication of Bishop Richard Williamson in January, part of an effort to reconcile an ultra-conservative movement with the Vatican. Three other bishops associated with the Society of St. Pius X were un-excommunicated at the same time. The excommunications were not related to Williamson's Holocaust denial. But it was Williamson who caused outrage, not only among Jews but also among German Catholic bishops and politicians, because the bishop had been filmed denying that the Nazis systematically set out to murder Jews in the Holocaust. The video was freely available on YouTube -- and by March, the pope was admitting the Vatican should have Googled Williamson before letting him back into the church. The excommunication's remission caused ""a discussion more heated than any we have seen for a long time,"" Benedict XVI wrote in an open letter to bishops in March. ""I have been told that consulting the information available on the Internet would have made it possible to perceive the problem early on,"" the pope acknowledged. ""I have learned the lesson that in the future in the Holy See we will have to pay greater attention to that source of news."" He made his first visit as pope to Israel in the wake of the controversy -- a visit planned long before the Williamson uproar erupted -- and delivered a clear message: ""Every effort must be made to fight anti-Semitism wherever it is found."" But fresh controversy blew up this month when he issued a decree proclaiming the ""heroic virtues"" of Pope Pius XII. Pius, who reigned from 1939 to 1958, is perhaps the most controversial pope of modern times, accused by detractors of not speaking out against the Nazi persecution of Jews. (John Cornwell titled his book about Pius XII ""Hitler's Pope,"" just to make his point perfectly clear.) Israel Meir Lau, a former chief rabbi of Israel and himself a Holocaust survivor, said it would ""shame"" the Vatican to declare Pius XII a saint. ""Especially not now, when many survivors are still alive. It will hurt them deeply to know that the man who could save [them], could do much more and did not do it,"" he said. ""It is not a good education for generations to come."" Even as the Holocaust was going on, the United States was pushing Pius XII to act. ""At the time of the Holocaust, questions about Pius XII's public silence were raised by Myron Taylor, the U.S. representative to the Vatican, and Taylor's assistant, Harold Tittman, who requested that the Holy See speak out on the issue,"" the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum said Monday. ""The opening of the post-1939 archival material is essential to a proper assessment of Pius XII. Only then will a sound and accurate portrait of his moral leadership during the Holocaust be possible,"" the museum argued. Benedict's spokesman, Father Federico Lombardi, called Pius XII an ""important pope that we know was guiding the church in very difficult times."" The Vatican has long argued that Pius did more behind the scenes to help Jews than he gets credit for -- but has not produced proof. It says it will open the Vatican archives from Pius XII's era to scholars, but not for several more years, blaming the delay on the length of time it takes to catalogue and prepare the materials. But by Wednesday, Lombardi was backpedalling on the wartime pope. First, he said, Benedict XVI had merely ratified a decision which the Vatican committee that evaluates candidates for sainthood had already made about Pius XII. Further, the pope's declaration was about Pius XII's ""intense relationship with God and continuous search for evangelical perfection ... and not the historical impact of all his operative decisions,"" Lombardi said in a written statement. The decree ""is in no way to be read as a hostile act towards the Jewish people, and it is to be hoped that it will not be considered as an obstacle on the path of dialogue between Judaism and the Catholic Church,"" Lombardi said, looking ahead to the pope's planned visit to the main synagogue in Rome in January. The visit will be the first time a pope goes to the synagogue since John Paul II did in 1986, and is meant to be a major symbol of good relations between the two faith communities. Benedict is a German -- in fact, he was forced as a young man to join the Hitler Youth -- and an accomplished musician who relaxes by playing piano. So why does he have such a tin ear when it comes to the Holocaust? Gruber suspects that different factions within the Vatican may be competing for influence. She noted that both the Williamson and Pius XII controversies blew up ""soon before what were expected to be major advances in Catholic-Jewish relations"" -- the trip to Israel and the synagogue visit. The Italian Jewish community, for its part, seems to understand the competing pressures on the pope, she said, citing a cartoon in the Jewish monthly Pagine Ebraiche showing Benedict walking across Rome's Tiber river towards the city's main synagogue -- on a tightrope. He holds a pole for balance, with a flag on one side saying ""dialogue"" and the other saying ""conversion."" ""It's a very sympathetic cartoon for the pope, surprisingly sympathetic,"" said Gruber, the author of ""Virtually Jewish: Reinventing Jewish Culture in Europe."" Whatever gaffes may cause problems between the Vatican and the Jewish community, Gruber said, there is little chance of a complete rupture in relations. ""Dialogue with the Jews is now embedded in Vatican doctrine,"" she said. ""It's a loud dialogue. There's shouting. But if you don't have opposing views, it's not dialogue -- it's an echo chamber.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British singer Leona Lewis was ""understandably shaken"" after a man attacked her during a book signing in central London Wednesday afternoon, a spokeswoman for her record label said. Leona Lewis was signing copies of her book ""Dreams"" when a man assaulted her, police say. A 29-year-old man was arrested after he punched Lewis at the Waterstones bookstore in Piccadilly Circus at 4:36 p.m. (10:36 a.m. ET), according to a Scotland Yard statement. She was signing copies of her new autobiography ""Dreams"" when the ""unprovoked attack"" happened, said Sarah Weinstein Dennison of the RCA Music Group.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Food and Drug Administration approved a second vaccine intended to protect against cervical cancer. GlaxoSmithKline has manufactured a vaccine for the prevention of cervical cancer. Cervarix, manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline, was approved Friday for prevention of cervical cancer and pre-cancerous lesions caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18. The vaccine is approved for use in girls and women ages 10 to 25 years and is to be administered in three doses. After the initial shot, the second and third doses are to be given within six months. ""The licensure of Cervarix adds another option in the prevention of cervical cancer,"" said Dr. Karen Midthun, acting director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. ""It has the potential to save lives from cervical cancer as well as reduce the need for biopsies and invasive procedures associated with the necessary follow-up from abnormal Pap tests."" According to GlaxoSmithKline, the vaccine is 70 percent effective against pre-cancerous lesions, regardless of HPV type. ""The vaccine contains two HPV types (16 & 18) responsible for the majority of cervical cancers in North America,"" said Sarah Alspach, a GlaxoSmithKline spokeswoman. ""But approximately 25 percent of cervical cancers are caused by other cancer-causing HPV types. Cervarix has been shown to reduce the incidence of pre-cancers resulting from cancer-causing virus types beyond 16 and 18."" The vaccine will be available this year, according to GSK, which did not divulge the price. Cervarix will be competing with Merck & Company's Gardasil, the first cervical cancer vaccine, which won FDA approval in June 2006. Gardasil, for girls and women ages 9 to 26, prevents against cervical, vulvar and vaginal cancers and protects against HPV types 11, 16 and 18. Gardasil's approval has been broadened by the FDA to include an indication for boys and young men ages 9 through 26 for prevention of genital warts caused by HPV types 6 and 11. ""This vaccine is the first preventive therapy against genital warts in boys and men ages 9 through 26, and, as a result, fewer men will need to undergo treatment for genital warts."" Midthun said. According to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention, HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the nation. More than 40 types of HPV can infect genital areas, according to the disease agency. But because many of them are not visible to the naked eye, most people who become infected don't know it.","FDA approves GlaxoSmithKline's HPV vaccine .

"(CNN) -- Bea Arthur, the actress best known for her roles as television's ""Maude"" and the sardonic Dorothy on ""The Golden Girls,"" has died of cancer, a family spokesman said Saturday. Bea Arthur, right, with ""Golden Girls"" co-star Rue McClanahan in June 2008. She was 86. Spokesman Dan Watt said that Arthur died Saturday morning at her home in Los Angeles, her family by her side. She is survived by her sons Matthew and Daniel and grandchildren Kyra and Violet, he said. No funeral services are currently planned, Watt said, adding that the family asked that donations be made to either the Art Attack Foundation or PETA in lieu of flowers. Arthur's opinionated Maude first appeared on Norman Lear's ""All in the Family"" as Edith Bunker's cousin, and was so popular that Lear created a spin-off series. In the '70s, ""Maude"" was ahead of the social curve, tackling hot topics not usually mentioned on situation comedies -- pornography, race relations and, in an episode titled ""Maude's Dilemma,"" abortion. That episode spawned demonstrations and generated hate mail for Arthur -- when Maude and husband Walter (Bill Macy) decided on that episode they were too old to raise a child. But many saw Maude as an enduring icon for women's liberation -- a big deal for the shy, Jewish girl born Bernice Frankel in New York City. During the Depression, Arthur's family left the Big Apple and opened a clothing store in Cambridge, Maryland. By the time she was 12, Arthur was nearly 5 feet, 10 inches tall, and self-conscious about her height. But she masked her insecurity with comedy and eventually returned to New York to study acting. Along the way, she had a short-lived marriage she never spoke about, but she kept the last name -- Arthur. The young Bea Arthur earned a living singing and doing stage work on Broadway and off-Broadway. Critics delighted in her haughty, serpent-tongued deliveries. Her first television appearance came in 1951 in a long-forgotten series called ""Once Upon a Tune,"" but she quickly made a name for herself with appearances on ""Studio One,"" ""Kraft Television Theatre"" and ""The Sid Caesar Show."" Arthur drew attention in ""Threepenny Opera"" on Broadway with Lotte Lenya, but she really turned heads in 1964 originating the role of Yente the Matchmaker in ""Fiddler on the Roof."" In 1966, Arthur won a Tony Award for the caustic Vera Charles in the play ""Mame,"" playing opposite Angela Lansbury in the title role. Eight years later, she reprised the role in the film version opposite Lucille Ball, but by then she was already well-established as Maude. Arthur left ""Maude"" in 1978, making television and some film appearances afterward. She starred in a short-lived series, ""Amanda's,"" in 1983 and then joined the cast of ""The Golden Girls"" in 1985 with Betty White, Rue McClanahan and Estelle Getty. Her role as Dorothy Zbornak gave Arthur her other major television success as one of four older women living together in Florida. (Getty played Arthur's mother). The role earned Arthur a second Emmy -- the first was for ""Maude."" Arthur left the show after Dorothy remarried at the end of the 1991-92 season. White, McClanahan and Getty continued for another season on the show, renamed ""The Golden Palace,"" but the show lasted only one season without Arthur. Arthur entered semi-retirement after the show ended in 1992, returning to television in sporadic guest appearances and appearing at several celebrity roasts. In the early part of this decade, Arthur appeared in several one-woman shows. Her last stage appearance was in 2006. Her last television appearance was on ""The View"" in 2007.","Actress Bea Arthur dies of cancer at age 86, spokesman says .

"ACCRA, Ghana (CNN) -- President Bush sought Wednesday to dispel rumors that the U.S. plans to bring ""all kinds of military to Africa,"" saying that is ""simply not true."" President Bush shakes hands with Ghanian President John Kufuor in Accra, Ghana, on Wednesday. He said the United States has no plans to add new bases in Africa but may open an office somewhere on the continent as part of its plans for Africom, a new U.S. military command that will focus on Africa. The president did not elaborate on the size of such an office but took pains to say it would not be a military base in the traditional sense. ""The purpose of this is not to add military bases,"" Bush said. ""I know there's rumors in Ghana -- 'all Bush is coming to do is try to convince you to put a big military base here.' That's baloney. Or as we say in Texas, that's bull.""  Watch what gifts Bush brought to Ghana » . The president of Ghana, John Kufuor, said he welcomed Bush's comments. ""I am happy for the president's dispelling any notion that the United States of America is intending to build military bases on the continent of Africa,"" he said. The U.S. military divides the world into regions and has a ""command"" for each region. The U.S. Central Command, for example, focuses on U.S. military concerns and activities in much of the Middle East and South Asia, while the U.S. Southern Command focuses on Latin America. The new command established last year, Africom, will be based in Stuttgart, Germany ""for the foreseeable future,"" the U.S. military says. ""Now, that doesn't mean we won't develop some kind of office somewhere in Africa. We haven't made our minds up,"" Bush said Wednesday. ""I want to dispel the notion that all of a sudden America is, you know, bringing all kinds of military to Africa. It's just simply not true."" About 1,800 U.S. troops are stationed in Djibouti, a country in the Horn of Africa, as part of the U.S. fight against Islamic extremists. Bush said Africom will ""provide military assistance to African nations so African nations are more capable of dealing with Africa's conflicts, like peacekeeping training.""

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- The funeral of a Chicago teenager whose beating death was caught on video was attended Saturday by scores of family members, officials and community leaders, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson. A funeral for Derrion Albert, a teen who was fatally beaten last month, was held Saturday on Chicago's South Side. Authorities say Derrion Albert, a 16-year-old honors student, was an innocent bystander who ended up in the middle of a September 24 street fight between two factions of students from Christian Fenger Academy High School. ""The killings keep coming -- one need not to be guilty to be killed in this war zone,"" Jackson told reporters before the service Saturday at the Greater Mount Hebron Baptist Church in South Side Chicago. ""We must declare a state of emergency. We have an obligation to prepare for our children safe passage."" Chicago Police Superintendent Jody Weis was among the Chicago officials who filed into the church as the the victim's mother, An-Janette Albert, wept in the arms of loved ones.  Watch friends, dignitaries attend funeral » . ""I can't believe I'm here and he's not with me,"" An-Janette Albert told CNN in an interview earlier in the week. ""I can't talk to him."" Four suspects have been charged with first-degree murder in Derrion Albert's killing, and police say they are looking for three more people in connection with the beating. Video footage of the incident shows Albert being hit by a person wielding a railroad tie. President Obama, a longtime Chicago resident, is sending Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Attorney General Eric Holder next week to talk with officials from the school, the students and the community about school violence, the White House said. Albert's sister, 11-year-old Rhaea, told CNN on Thursday that she looked up to her big brother, and now wants to be an even better student in his honor. But his death haunts her. ""I'm kind of nervous to go outside these days because of what happens to kids now,"" she said. ""Kids around my age ... they could still get hurt, no matter what.""  Watch slain teen's mother talk about her feelings » . When school let out at 2:50 p.m. on September 24, Albert was nearly six blocks away -- on his way to a bus stop -- when two groups of students converged on the street, said Tandra Simonton, spokeswoman for the Cook County prosecutor. The factions -- one that lived near the Altgeld Gardens housing development and one in an area known as ""The Ville"" -- began fighting after an earlier shooting that police called gang-related. According to Simonton, Albert was approached by two members of ""The Ville"" faction and struck in the head with a long wooden railroad tie, then punched in the face. After being knocked unconscious for a brief period, Albert regained consciousness and tried to move from the fight, but was then attacked by a second group of five members from the opposing faction, Simonton said. Albert was taken to Roseland Community Hospital and then to Advocate Christ Hospital and Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.","Rev.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- For almost a century, the old dog has traversed landscapes across the United States, with weary, budget-conscious travelers peeking out of its windows. Greyhound bus services will run from London to cities such as Portsmouth and Southampton. Now, the iconic Greyhound is taking to the road in Britain. The company will run hourly bus services from London to select cities, starting Monday. In contrast to its U.S. services, however, the buses are glitzier and more luxurious. ""The UK service will have wireless Internet, spacious leather seats, more leg room and free newspapers,"" said Alex Warner, managing director of Greyhound UK. ""Obviously, we wanted our services to reflect the nature of UK passengers."" For inaugural Greyhound service in Britain, the company aimed to start with the best the United States has to offer, Warner added. In North America, the same services are available from New York and Washington to select cities such as Boston and Toronto, Canada. ""There are plans to expand that. Americans should watch closely. We will introduce more of these services based on how well they are received in the UK,"" Warner said. Despite the added benefits, fares will still target the budget-conscious traveler in Britain, according to Warner. The service starts with a few cities -- from London to Portsmouth and Southampton, he said. The approximately 120-kilometer (80-mile) trip will cost £1 ($1.60) if a ticket is bought in advance, Warner said. Prices will go up to £4 or £5, depending on time of purchase. ""We are planning to keep the prices within that range,"" Warner said. Greyhound Lines is owned by British transport company FirstGroup, which bought it from its U.S. parent in 2007. It was founded in 1914, and has services in Mexico and Canada, according to its Web site. In a nod to its cameos in American movies and songs, such as the 1969 film ""Midnight Cowboy"" and Simon and Garfunkel's 1972 hit ""America,"" Greyhound plans to keep at least one tie to its U.S. origins.

"(CNN) -- For nearly 20 years Jennifer Schuett has held onto every memory of the night she was abducted from her bedroom, raped and left for dead. Jennifer Schuett remembers small details of the night she was abducted, raped and her throat slashed at age 8. It was August 10, 1990. Schuett was 8 years old and lived alone with her mother in the first floor of an apartment complex in Dickinson, Texas. The bedroom windows faced the parking lot. Investigators were never able to identify a suspect, but new DNA testing may change that. CNN normally does not identify victims of sexual assaults. But Schuett wants to go public with her story-- and her name-- to increase the chances of finding and prosecuting her attacker. ""It's not about me anymore,"" she explained. ""It's about all the little girls that go to sleep at night. I know there are so many girls out there who have been raped and hurt. You have to fight back."" For that, Schuett, 27, is relying on her voice, her memory and advances in DNA testing. ""I remember everything; I've always wanted to remember everything, so I can find the person that did this,"" Schuett told CNN during a phone interview. ""If I had blocked this out of my memory, the investigation wouldn't have come this far. I'm a fighter."" Schuett says she was alone in her bed when a man came creeping in through the window. She remembers waking up in a stranger's arms as he carried her across a dark parking lot. ""When I opened my eyes, his face was the first thing I saw and he covered my face and mouth,"" she said. ""He ran with me to his car. He told me he was an undercover cop and that he knew my family. He seemed calm -- not nervous, not aggressive."" After they left the parking lot, he drove her through the streets of Dickinson, Texas, pulling into a mechanic shop next to her elementary school. ""Watch the moon. The moon will change colors and that is when your mom will come to get you,"" she recalled him saying. ""Oh, it looks like she is not coming."" Schuett said he drove her to an overgrown field next to the school and raped her. ""He had a knife to my throat and touched my face and offered me Reese's pieces,"" she said. ""I was scared but I knew I couldn't be fast enough to get away. Cars would drive by but I couldn't get away to get help."" She believes she passed out. ""I woke up to him dragging me by my ankles,"" she said. ""I felt thorns ripping the skin off my back. I would see him turn to look at me and I would play dead."" She passed out again, and awoke at daybreak. ""I remember feeling dew around me and I couldn't figure out why when I screamed I couldn't hear myself,"" said Schuett. She lay naked on top of an ant hill with her throat slashed from ear to ear, and her voice box torn. Much later, she said, ""I heard children playing hide and seek. That is when one of the kids tripped over my foot,"" said Schuett. She was found at 6 p.m. on a hot August day. She had been lying in the field for nearly 12 hours. She was rushed to the hospital in critical condition. ""Three days after the attack, I started giving a description. The doctors told me I would never be able to talk again, but I proved them all wrong,"" said Schuett. She believes she got her voice back so she could tell her story. ""I never wanted to play the victim role. I wanted to be a strong survivor,"" she said. But the attack left its mark. ""For the first two years, I had nightmares and was scared,"" she said. ""But I never wanted sympathy. ... If I had given up, he would have won, and I wanted to show him: 'You didn't win.' "" Shuettt said she is now ""on a manhunt."" Houston FBI Special Agent Richard Rennison is one of the lead investigators in the case, along with Dickinson police Detective Tim Cromie. Both men were discussing the case, when Rennison received a memo from the FBI's Child Abduction Rapid Deployment (CARD) Team, saying they were looking for cold child abduction cases that could be retested for DNA evidence. The Schuett case was one of the cases selected. Rennison, who has 10 years of experience in child abduction cases, said he has never seen a case like Schuett's. ""This is the only one that I can think of that the victim has suffered some traumatic injuries and survived,"" he said, ""The main reason the CARD team picked this case was because she was alive. In cases of child abduction it is rare that the child is recovered alive. Frequently you recover a body and most times you never find them."" Schuett is a living witness who can help put the pieces together. The investigators found evidence collected 19 years ago, which can be retested. It includes the underwear and pajamas Schuett was wearing, as well as a man's underwear and T-shirt, which were found in the field where Schuett was left for dead. The clothes were tested in 1990, but the sample wasn't large enough for conclusive results. But now, modern techniques allow DNA to be isolated from a single human cell. Once they get back the DNA results -- ""any time now,"" Schuett said -- they will run them through the FBI's criminal database and see if they get a match. The FBI has also offered a $10,000 reward for information that could lead to a break in the case. And last weekend Schuett appeared in ""America's Most Wanted,"" which resulted in several leads from viewers who called in with information. ""Someone might remember something about that night,"" Schuett said. ""Dickinson is a really small community. Everybody knows everybody. I know someone in town knows something.""","Jennifer Schuett was grabbed from her bedroom and attacked at age 8 .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Obama will meet with top congressional leaders from both parties Tuesday to discuss a war in Afghanistan that now appears to be at a potential tipping point. The meeting on the war comes as the Obama administration conducts a review of its Afghan strategy. Obama will be joined by, among others, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, House Minority Leader John Boehner, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and the heads of the Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees in the House and Senate, two Democratic officials said. The meeting comes amid the Obama administration's comprehensive review of U.S. strategy in Afghanistan. Several top military leaders and opposition Republicans are pressing Obama to act quickly to increase the present 68,000-troop level by as many as 40,000. ""There's no doubt that, particularly on funding, it's not going to happen until Congress signs off,"" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Monday. ""They're an important part of this, and the president wants to hear from them."" In March, Obama announced a plan to send more than 20,000 additional troops to the country to provide security for a national election. That move followed what Obama and others called years of inadequate resources in Afghanistan because of the Bush administration's focus on Iraq. The Obama strategy was based on a counterinsurgency mission intended to defeat terrorists based in Afghanistan while winning local support and helping with development. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, who took over four months ago as the top U.S. commander in the country, has submitted an assessment in which, sources have told CNN, he says he needs additional forces to carry out the counterinsurgency strategy successfully. Otherwise, McChrystal reportedly warns, the mission could fail, bringing a return of power to the Taliban. ""We need to reverse the current trends, and time does matter,"" McChrystal said last week in a speech in London, England. ""Waiting does not prolong a favorable outcome. This effort will not remain winnable indefinitely."" U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, however, appeared to push back Monday against those who are loudly urging a rapid troop increase. It's ""important that we get it right,"" he told a U.S. Army audience. Gates said that it's also ""important that all of us ... provide the best advice to the president candidly but privately."" Gen. George Casey, chief of staff of the Army, echoed Gates' view, telling reporters that he would be sharing his views ""in private"" and that they'd be ""the second to know."" Obama has yet to respond to McChrystal's report, prompting opponents to accuse him of indecisiveness and playing politics that puts U.S. soldiers on the ground at risk.  Watch more on the debate over the best way forward » . National Security Adviser James Jones Jr. on Sunday cited three developments since March that have led the White House to reconsider its overall Afghanistan strategy: . • Questions about the legitimacy of Afghan President Hamid Karzai's election victory. • McChrystal's conclusion that the Taliban is stronger than previously thought. • Neighboring Pakistan's improved efforts to change the overall dynamic of the border region. ""The key in Afghanistan is to have a triad of things happen simultaneously,"" Jones said on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" listing improved security, economic development and ""good governance and the rule of law."" Jones said Karzai's government ""is going to have to pitch in and do much better"" than it has to improve the governance situation after the elections, widely considered as tainted by vote fraud in some areas. Some in Obama's inner circle, including Vice President Joe Biden, are advocating a counterterrorism approach that focuses on combating al Qaeda through the use of unmanned drones and special forces without involving additional troops. Others, especially McChrystal, are strongly advocating the broader counterinsurgency approach, which requires a much larger U.S. military footprint in the country.  See who has Obama's ear on Afghanistan » . Sen. John McCain of Arizona and other Senate Republicans -- as well as other advocates of an increase in troop levels -- are pushing for McChrystal to testify before Congress about his assessment. Senate Armed Service Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Michigan, rejected their request nearly two weeks ago, calling it ""premature."" Eight American troops and two Afghan security force members were killed Saturday when militants opened fire on an outpost with rockets, mortars and heavy-caliber machine guns, according to an initial U.S. military report on the battle. The bodies of four of those U.S. soldiers -- Army Sgt. Joshua Kirk, of South Portland, Maine; Specialists Michael Scusa of Villas, New Jersey, and Christopher Griffin, of Kincheloe, Michigan; and Pfc. Kevin Thomson, of Reno, Nevada -- are scheduled to be brought back to the United States on Tuesday, the Pentagon said. It was the largest number of Americans killed by hostile action in a single day in Afghanistan since July 2008, according to CNN records.

"NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (CNN)  -- A Yale University lab technician was arrested Thursday and charged with murder in the slaying of a graduate student whose body was found in the basement wall of an off-campus medical research building, police said. Raymond Clark, 24, was arrested and charged with murder, police said. His bond was set at $3 million. Raymond Clark was apprehended about 8:10 a.m. ET at a Super 8 motel in Cromwell, Connecticut, where he had spent the night after being released Wednesday following his submission to DNA testing. Bond for Clark has been set at $3 million, New Haven Police Chief James Lewis said. Hours after his arrest, Clark appeared in court and did not enter a plea. Standing with chains on his ankles and his palms on a table, he looked only at the judge and spoke only to acknowledge that his rights were read to him. A court date of October 6 was set. Lewis described the killing as an instance of ""workplace violence"" but did not elaborate.  Watch chief, acquaintances talk about Clark » . Annie Le's body was found in the basement wall of an off-campus medical research building Sunday. She had been strangled. Le, 24, a pharmacology student, was last seen alive September 8, the day she appeared in a surveillance video entering a four-story lab at 10 Amistad St., about 10 blocks from the main campus. Her body was found on what was to have been her wedding day. Lewis said the arrest ""went smoothly.""  Watch the police chief announce the arrest » . He could not release details about the charges or whether DNA results led police to arrest Clark, who initially was described as a person of interest in the case. ""This arrest warrant has been sealed, so no further information can be released in order to comply with this court order,"" Lewis said. Clark could have been arrested Wednesday if he had declined to provide DNA samples and allow police to search his home, but he was released after complying, New Haven city spokeswoman Jessica Mayorga said. Police had been monitoring the motel where Clark was staying. When asked about the arrest, Clark's attorney David Dworski referred CNN to the statement he released earlier: ""We are committed to proceeding appropriately with the authorities with whom we are in regular contact."" Two other search warrants also were executed Wednesday -- one on property belonging to Clark that was not named in the first warrant and a second for Clark's vehicle, which was being processed Wednesday evening, Lewis said earlier. He said Clark is a technician who does ""custodial-type"" work at the building. Clark answered police questions for a while but later retained an attorney and stopped, Lewis said. Yale President Richard Levin said while the school's administration is ""relieved"" by the news of Clark's arrest, ""we must resist the temptation to rush to judgment."" Clark, a lab technician at Yale since December 2004, had nothing in his employment history that ""gave an indication that his involvement in such a crime might be possible,"" Levin said in a statement Thursday. Lewis said Clark and Le worked in the same building and passed in the hallway, but he refused to comment further on whether they knew each other. Investigators have collected about 250 pieces of evidence, Lewis said.  Watch police discuss the investigation » . Lewis earlier said police had reviewed about 700 hours of video and interviewed more than 150 people, some more than once.   Watch a timeline leading up to Le's death » . Authorities have not released information on what DNA evidence may have been found, although investigators said earlier that bloody clothing was found hidden above tiles in a drop ceiling in another part of the building. Police have not described the clothes that were found, nor said to whom they might have belonged. Teams of investigators at a Connecticut State Police lab worked through the weekend processing and examining the bloodstained garments. But Thomas Kaplan, editor in chief of the Yale Daily News, said a Yale police official told the college paper that the clothes were not what Le was wearing when she entered the building. Lewis said Wednesday that processing of the building was nearing completion and police would probably clear it Thursday morning.  Watch a report on the police saying the killing was no random act » . Le was to have been married Sunday on New York's Long Island to Jonathan Widawsky, a Columbia University graduate student. Le was from Placerville, California, and seemed to have been aware of the risks of crime in a university town. In February, she compared crime and safety at Yale with other Ivy League schools for a piece for B magazine, published by the medical school. Among the tips she offered: Keep a minimum amount on your person. When she walked over to the research building last week, she left her purse, credit cards and cell phone in her office.

"BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- A hoax video purporting to show Michael Jackson hopping out of a coroner's van alive was produced by a German television station as an experiment, the broadcaster told CNN Monday. Michael Jackson was found dead on June 25. He had been preparing for a comeback. It was made to show how easy it is to spread rumors online, said Heike Schultz, a spokeswoman for RTL, the leading private broadcaster in Germany. ""We sent out a press release before we did the video to alert everyone that it was fake, but once posted it spread really fast,"" she said. More than 880,000 people have clicked on the most popular version of the video on YouTube, posted by a user using the name ""michaeljacksonhoax"" under the title ""Michael Jackson alive?! Seen coming out of coroner's van!"" Nearly 3,600 people have commented on the video. ""All the moves, his posture, the stepping out of the van, looks like MJ. He steps out very cautious, like a moonwalk. Also the slowly walking is just like Michael did,"" one user wrote. ""I really hope he's still alive....I could never forgive him for scaring me like that, but I could never hate him... :),"" another said.   Watch video of the hoax » . Not everyone was fooled. ""I would forgive Michael for anything because he is so super sexy but seriously guys he has passed,"" one user wrote. ""MJ has passed so leave him alone this movie is fake. R.I.P. Michael I love and miss u."" A second version of the video, posted and annotated by ""MUZIKfactory2"" to show inconsistencies, has been seen more than 329,000 times. Both versions were posted on August 25. RTL produced the video for its daily magazine ""Explosive"" to tell people not to take information at face value, the station's representative said. ""This was so obviously fake, in the case of Michael Jackson, it just was not possible,"" Schultz said. According to Schultz, some viewers have been happy that the magazine showed them how easy it was to fake information online. Others who were Michael Jackson fans have told RTL that this was the wrong topic to do this kind of experiment on. ""It was not a bad thing, since it was so obviously a fake. But it is now in our poison wardrobe and it won't be revived again,"" Schultz said. RTL said it removed the video from the Internet, but it can still be seen on YouTube. News of Jackson's death on June 25 sparked something of a feeding frenzy on the Web, as many news Web sites struggled to cope with the sheer volume of traffic. With that came rumors that dragged in other celebrities completely unconnected to the ""King of Pop's"" death. One Wikipedia prankster wrote that Jackson had been ""savagely murdered"" by his brother Tito, who had strangled him ""with a microphone cord."" Soon rumors spread online that movie star Jeff Goldblum had fallen from the Kauri Cliffs in New Zealand while filming his latest movie. On several search engines, ""Jeff Goldblum"" soon became the only non-Jackson-related term to crop up in the top 10. The rumors forced Goldblum's publicist to issue a statement to media outlets, saying: ""Reports that Jeff Goldblum has passed away are completely untrue. He is fine and in Los Angeles."" At the same time, Harrison Ford was also rumored to have fallen from a yacht off the south of France. CNN's Per Nyberg in London, England and Frederik Pleitgen in Berlin, Germany, contributed to this report.","Video purportedly showed Michael Jackson hopping out of a coroner's van .

"MEDELLIN, Colombia (CNN) -- This city's drug underworld is littered with ""poseurs"" -- lowlife triggermen pretending they're the real hard cases. Samir Romero, wanted by police for two murders, was killed in  August. He was shot 13 times. But a longstanding and trusted source, with intimate knowledge of Medellin's violent subculture, assured me the two men I was about to meet were the real deal. My destination: a single-story home in the city's notorious ""Commune 13"" district where I had set up a meeting with two hit men, who have for years hired their lethal services out to the cocaine cartels. Inside the house, a man called ""Red"" sat on a couch toying a fully loaded 9mm Ruger pistol. ""This will stop somebody nicely,"" he said, as I glanced at it. His face and arms were covered in burn marks. He said it was a testament of the day a barrel of acid spilled onto him as he was working in a clandestine cocaine processing lab in northern Colombia. Red explained that after the accident, the lab foreman tossed him out, half-dead, into a jungle clearing. What little strength he had left, he said he used to bat away vultures. And, against the odds, he made his way to safety and slowly recovered. When Red left the clinic months later, he said he went straight back to the drug lab and gunned down the foreman and three of his henchmen. That wasn't his first killing though, he told me. When he was just 11 years old, Red recounted, he took a razor to the throat of a neighborhood drug pusher who had been molesting his little sister. The other man, ""C"", sat quietly as I listened to Red. Like Red, my source told me, ""C"" was also the so-called ""chief"" of a number of neighborhoods -- running local drug-peddling operations, extortion rackets and organizing hits for a big cartel boss he simply referred to as ""El Cucho,"" or ""The Old Man."" It was a hot morning and he was shirtless. His chest was branded with a tattoo of the Virgin Maria Auxilatrix, known in Colombia as the ""Virgin of the Assassins."" Hitmen, or ""sicarios"" as they call them here, revere her and pray to her for protection against arrest or death and for help to carry out their killings.  Watch as Medellin law enforcement moves from killing to killing » . During our time with the hit men they offered a fascinating insight into their violent world -- from how much they get paid to what their mothers think of their lifestyle: . Penhaul: Why are Medellin's drug bosses and the street gangs in a war right now? ""RED"": ""These problems come about because they're looking for a good man to run things. We have to find him and, in order to find him, what's happening right now has to run its course."" ""C"": ""Medellin has exploded right now because different groups want to control it and earn money and gain territory. The authorities locked up, extradited, or cut cooperation deals with the big guys, the ones who controlled all this. Those were the ones people respected. Now there's no respect and anybody who has a bunch of money is grabbing a few kids from a poor neighborhood and putting them to work.""  Penhaul: What are the cartel bosses paying for a contract killing now? ""C"": ""If you're talking about a contract hit then right now you can get four or five million pesos (between US$2,000 and $2,500) to kill some idiot slimeball. Then of course there are bigger hits where you can earn 15 (million) or 20 million (between $7,500 and $10,000). Some of those hits pay pretty well. There's a lot of people around here with a lot of money and they're using it for bad things. Sometimes even the politicians will pay for a hit to get somebody out of their way."" Penhaul: Why did you get into this lifestyle? ""Red"": ""People need to eat and there's a lot of hunger. We don't just want the crumbs. That's the big problem. There's a lot of idle hands around here and many people think they have a chance if they have a gun in their hand."" ""C"": ""I grew up in a slum and every time I stepped outside the door there were guys from the local gang smoking (marijuana) joints. They had guns, the best motorbikes and money so I started running errands for them."" Penhaul: Didn't you have any big dreams when you were kids? ""Red"": ""I always said when I grow up I would build a house for my old lady with a cement roof and plaster and paint on the walls. I dreamed I'd be able to give her money to go to the supermarket every week."" ""C"": ""I dreamed of being a professional soccer player. I was pretty good. But I never got the chance."" Penhaul: Do you think you've made your mothers proud by killing people? ""Red"": ""I once gave my mum a wad of cash after I did a job. She took the wad and slapped me in the face and told me not to bring that cursed money into the house. She begged me to get out of that life. She was afraid they would kill me."" ""C"": ""My mum knows nothing about this. I guess she imagines because she tells me to take care otherwise I'll wind up dead. But she doesn't know for sure."" Penhaul: What did your first contract hit feel like? ""Red"": ""You kill the first one and you panic for a few days. You're nervous. But then you kill the second one and that's a kind of a medicine. It takes the pain away that you were feeling after the first killing."" ""C"": ""The first time is really f***ed up. I nearly went mad. You see a cop and think he's going to arrest you. I was 16 or 17. That was my first time. I hardly even wanted to eat. But then you carry on and kill this one and that one. You earn money. After I killed somebody the first time I bought my first decent pair of sneakers. ""It's not so tough now. Sometimes you kill somebody and you know they were going to kill you. It's not a question of conscience. It's a question of kill or be killed."" Penhaul: Don't you feel any remorse? ""C"": You know you messed up when you go to the wake and see people crying and you know it's your fault. But I don't back down from a killing because I know if somebody comes after me they won't back down."" ""Red"": ""I've got feelings and sometimes you sit down and think what a shame. But the person who's trying to shoot you isn't going to think the same. You're not killing somebody for the fun of it. If you don't mark your territory then you're a nobody."" Penhaul: So, apart from the money, why do you do it? ""C"": ""To gain respect round here you have to be a mother f***er. You've got to be a bastard so people respect you. If you're quiet and respectful everybody takes advantage. But if they know you're a mother f***er who'll bust their ass at the first sign of trouble then they respect you and your family."" Penhaul: Are you killing innocent people? ""C"": ""I never kill somebody who doesn't deserve it. Sometimes I'll hunt down a ""patient"" for a week just so that I don't make any mistakes. You can't go and kill somebody just because you want to. You have to ask for permission from the big guys who control us. You explain to the ""old man"" and he gives the final word."" Penhaul: Are you ever on the receiving end of bullets? ""Red"": ""They once shot me four times at point blank range. I heard them laughing as they walked away and one came back and kicked me in the head for good measure. When I got better he was the first one I killed. I've been shot 17 times. Well let's call it 19 if you count the ones that just graze you. They say some bodies have divine protection. Let's hope mine is one of them."" Penhaul: Why don't normal citizens just turn you in? Because they're afraid? ""C"": ""The community collaborates with us. We give them food parcels and we throw parties for them and give toys to the kids. We don't mistreat everybody, just the ones who deserve it. We don't kill innocent people."" Penhaul: Do you want to get out of this life? ""C"": ""I know you should pay what you owe. But I don't want to pay for all those deaths. I'll be absolutely f***ed if I have to pay. I want to get out of this but I want a clean slate. If I pay my debt to the law then that means jail and if I pay on the street then that means death. I don't want to go to jail or to die."" Penhaul: Do you see any quick end to the current cartel violence in Medellin? ""C"": ""We've survived one war, then another and now this one. I can't see it all ending. I don't think that will happen. If you kill two or three people there's four or five more behind him who want to kill you.""","Colombian hitmen talk about their careers to CNN .

"(CNN) -- The father of Haleigh Cummings, a Florida girl who disappeared in February, plans to file for divorce from the girl's stepmother, a key witness in the case, his attorneys told HLN's ""Nancy Grace."" Ronald Cummings plans to divorce his wife, Misty, his attorney says. The move follows weeks of reported tension between Ronald and Misty Cummings during the search for Haleigh, who was 5 when last seen. In papers expected to be filed Tuesday, Ronald Cummings, 25, cites irreconcilable differences in ending his short marriage to his 17-year-old wife, said Terry Shoemaker, Ronald Cummings' attorney. Haleigh went missing from her father's home in Satsuma, Florida, on February 9. Cummings has made several public pleas for information in her disappearance. Misty Cummings, then known as Misty Croslin, was the last person known to have seen Haleigh the night she disappeared from the family's rented mobile home. The teenager said she tucked Haleigh and her 4-year-old brother into bed about 8 p.m. and went to sleep herself two hours later, but awoke at 3 a.m. to find the girl missing and a cinder block propping open a back door. Ronald Cummings called police and reported his daughter missing when he returned from work at dawn. Investigators have said they do not feel Misty Cummings has told them everything she knows. ""The police have been telling me that I've been keeping Misty under my wing and that's why she hasn't talked to the cops,"" Ronald Cummings told a ""Nancy Grace"" producer Tuesday. ""So now, here you go, I divorced her. So now go find my baby.""  Watch Ronald Cummings speak to Nancy Grace » . The Putnam County Sheriff's office said in August that ""the evidence and investigatory effort has minimized the likelihood that Haleigh's disappearance is the work of a stranger."" Ronald Cummings and Crystal Sheffield, Haleigh's mother, are not considered suspects, police said. ""Investigators believe that Misty Croslin-Cummings continues to hold important answers in the case,"" the sheriff's office said in a written statement. ""She has failed to provide any sort of detailed accounting of the hours during the late evening and early morning of Haleigh's disappearance. Furthermore, physical evidence at the scene contradicts Misty's sketchy account of her evening activities."" Shoemaker said his client told Misty Cummings he wanted a divorce on Sunday, and that the a divorce agreement was drawn up Monday. The agreement was sent to Misty Cummings' lawyer for her signature. ""He really didn't come to us and say, 'I want to file for divorce,'"" said another of Ronald Cummings' attorneys, Brandon Beardsley. ""My understanding is that this is something that he and Misty have been discussing for the last few days and they're contemplating it because they ultimately feel that it is in the best interest for both of them."" Misty Cummings' attorney, Robert Fields, told CNN he has not talked with his client and doesn't know her thoughts regarding the divorce. Fields said he had received the papers via e-mail but had not had a chance to review them. Asked what he thought the divorce would mean for the search for Haleigh, he said, ""Probably nothing."" ""You have to understand that ever since Haleigh went missing, they have been scrutinized,"" Beardsley said of the Cummingses. ""They can't go out to dinner, can't even go to the convenience store to get a drink. ... The pressure of everything that is going on, the allegations and speculation, has been a stress on the relationship. The two lived together for about six months before marrying in March. The divorce agreement provides no financial terms, according to Shoemaker. On Monday, Misty Cummings left Satsuma to stay with a friend in Orlando, 50 miles south, Shoemaker said.","Haleigh Cummings' father plans to file for divorce from the girl's stepmother .

"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (Reuters) -- Malaysia defended on Friday its practice of caning criminals after a disturbing video of a prison-yard caning session burst onto the Internet, reigniting criticism from lawyers and human rights advocates. In the video, a naked man is shown strapped to an upright wooden frame, his rear exposed to a uniformed official who lifts a meter-long rattan stick above his head before bringing it down on the prisoner's buttocks, tearing the flesh with each strike. The video, in which the moaning and shaking prisoner is struck six times, has spread quickly across the Internet, capturing headlines in the Web sites of some European newspapers and forcing the Malaysian government on to the defensive. ""The government at this stage has no plans to abolish the cane as part of punishment,"" Deputy Internal Security Minister Fu Ah Kiow told Reuters by telephone. He said the video was an official recording that had been leaked onto the Internet. The video had been produced for deterrent purposes, with excerpts shown during anti-narcotic education sessions to would-be drug dealers, he added. ""This video was taken officially by us for a demonstration purpose, but it is not supposed to have the victim's face identified. Somehow somebody must have taped (copied) it."" Malaysia is not alone in caning criminals, which critics say breaches human rights norms, including the U.N. Convention Against Torture. Neighboring Singapore also wields the rattan stick and caused a U.S. outcry 13 years ago when it caned an American teenager, Michael Fay, four times for vandalism. But Malaysia's Bar Council, which represents about 12,000 lawyers, recently called for a ban on caning, saying the ""cruel"" practice was rising in Malaysia, especially on illegal immigrants after hasty hearings arranged at crammed detention centers. ""They have started imposing the caning sentence in a more rigorous way and it can affect anyone who comes in (to Malaysia) without a passport or papers, so it happens to asylum-seekers and refugees,"" said Latheefa Koya, of the council's Legal Aid Center. The government denied use of the cane was widespread against illegal immigrants and Deputy Internal Security Minister Fu said it was reserved mainly for the traffickers of illegal immigrants in addition to drug-traffickers and violent criminals. Fu said the government also faced calls from victims of crime for the use of the cane to be maintained or even increased for some serious crimes ""in view of the crime rate in Malaysia"". Crime is seen as a major electoral issue in the run-up to a possible early general election, expected early next year. ""We respect the view of the Bar Council but there are many other views from the people and also from the victims of crimes that there should be an increase (in caning),"" Fu said.

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN)  -- Angry workers beat to death a human resources vice president after he laid off 42 employees at an auto-parts manufacturing company in southern India, police said Wednesday. Roy George was vice-president for human resources at Pricol, the auto-parts company. Some four to five workers, belonging to a union not recognized by the company, barged into his office and beat him up with iron rods, said N. Kannan, a police superintendent of Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu state. George, 47, died from his head injuries Tuesday, Kannan told CNN. Police have arrested nine people and are expected to round up more. Last year the Indian head of an Italian company died after allegedly being beaten by a mob of sacked employees. More than 60 people were charged with the murder of the chief executive of Graziano Transmissioni near New Delhi. Earlier this month, India's Jet Airways had to cancel hundreds of flights after pilots struck work over the sacking of two of their colleagues in August. Companies in the South Asian nation, despite its rapid economic growth in recent years, have often been faced with tough labor issues because of archaic laws and company policies on hiring and retrenchment. Business consultants in India blame such labor standoffs on what they call lack of transparency in retrenchment or layoff policies. Hiring and firing conditions are often not explained to workers by their companies, said Rajeev Karwal, founding-director of Milagrow Business and Knowledge Solutions. Issues could spiral out of control if the businesses and bureaucrats are seen in a ""corrupt nexus"" by the employees seeking reprieve from labor authorities, he said.","Roy George was vice-president for human resources at Pricol auto-parts company .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Kanye West may be able to take time off to think about his life after all now that his concert tour has been canceled. Kanye West has canceled his ""Fame Kills"" tour with Lady Gaga. It was announced two weeks ago. Concert promoter Live Nation said Thursday that West's concert tour with Lady Gaga, titled ""Fame Kills,"" has been canceled just two weeks after it was announced. The reason for the cancellation was not revealed. West told NBC's Jay Leno last month, before the tour was officially announced, that he planned ""to take some time off"" in the aftermath of his MTV Awards show embarrassment. The three-month, 34-show tour across the United States and Canada was to start next month. Tickets went on sale last week. Live Nation said people who bought tickets could get refunds at the point of purchase. Tickets purchased online and on the phone will be refunded automatically, the promoter said. West caused a ruckus at the MTV Awards last month when he put down his bottle of cognac, jumped on the MTV Music Video Awards stage and grabbed the microphone from singer Taylor Swift as she was giving an acceptance speech. West, who apologized the next day on ""The Jay Leno Show,"" seemed to blame his erratic behavior on the lack of time he had to grieve his mother's death two years ago. ""I deal with hurt and, you know, so many, you know, celebrities, they never take the time off, and I've never taken the time off to really, you know, I just, music after music and tour after tour on tour,"" West told Leno.

"Prague, Czech Republic (CNN) -- Fireworks and rock 'n' roll echoed across central Prague on Tuesday as thousands of marchers commemorated the 20th anniversary of the ""Velvet Revolution"" that toppled Communist rule. The peaceful 1989 uprising began with a student march to mark a 1939 clampdown on opposition in what was then Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia. It drew 15,000 people -- students as well as teachers, professors and ordinary Czechs who had grown weary of state control. Ivan Pilip, one of the students who took part, said the march ""was very different"" from previous demonstrations he had joined. ""There was a different group of people,"" he said. ""We feel that people that participated in such events before had come, and they're ready to do something. And it was more and more visible every minute."" The protest was held a week after the opening of the Berlin Wall, as pressure was building on the Communist governments of Eastern Europe. When the demonstrators tried to divert the march to central Prague's Wenceslas Square, they were attacked by police -- a response that led tens of thousands more people to join mass demonstrations that lasted another 10 days. ""My kids cannot understand today what was moving our minds and hearts that day 20 years ago,"" Pilip's wife, Lucie, said Tuesday. ""We watched television today to show them what we had come through these 20 years, and I think it's an enormous success."" The protests led to talks between government officials and the Civic Forum, a group of dissidents led by playwright Vaclav Havel. The Communist Party ceded power in December, and Havel became president. ""Many of our citizens who took part in the democratic changes died already with a feeling that they contributed to something that meant a lot,"" Havel said Tuesday. ""In our ordinary, daily lives, we tend to forget our friends of that time -- our comrades, free-thinking individuals."" The anniversary march was capped by a concert that featured dissident musicians of the day, along with American folk singer Joan Baez. Havel himself appeared onstage with a guitar, but told the crowd, ""Don't worry, the guitar doesn't mean I'm going to play today."" Musicians, actors and other artists played major roles in the protests. Michael Kocab, now the Czech Republic government's human rights minister, was a rock singer who became the revolutionaries' key negotiator. ""In the beginning there was many times this idea, 'What am I doing here,'"" Kocab told CNN recently. ""I knew in the future I'd get used to it. And five or 10 days later, I forgot I was a musician and I submerged myself in political negotiations. And I liked it."" The celebration was organized by Opona, a nonprofit group established to observe the milestone anniversary of the dismantling of the Iron Curtain. ""Our inspiration to do this was from our memories -- we still remember the times that preceded the events,"" said David Gaydecka, one of the organizers. ""We believe that the changes in those 20 years have been positive despite all those maladies which came along with the freedom."" -- CNN's Phil Black and Fionnuala Sweeney contributed to this report.","Czech students take to the streets to mark 20th anniversary of fall of communist rule .

"NASHVILLE, Tennessee (CNN) -- The accused came from all walks of life: Retirees, dads and twentysomethings. An engineer, a business owner and an auto worker. A man in a wheelchair. Men in need of Spanish or Farsi translators. Brett Beasley, with Nashville's Health Department, educates men arrested for trying to buy sex about STDs. About 40 men somberly entered a classroom on a recent Saturday morning. About half of them wore shiny wedding bands. All had tried to buy a prostitute's services and were caught by police. It was their first offense, and a county court referred them to a one-day program called the John School. It's a program run by volunteers and city officials in conjunction with Magdalene House, a nonprofit that works to get prostitutes off the streets. ""Prostitution doesn't discriminate,"" said Kenny Baker, a cognitive behavioral therapist who is the program's director. ""Most of these men don't have a prior criminal history, so our goal is to help these folks understand why they put themselves in a bad position, to prevent it from happening again."" Set in a church in Nashville, Tennessee, the John School is led by former prostitutes, health experts, psychologists and law enforcement officers who talk to -- and at times berate -- the men about the risks of hiring a prostitute. Prostitution is based on the law of supply and demand. The thinking is: Women won't stop selling sex until men stop buying. So Nashville and a growing number of cities are shifting their focus from locking up suppliers to educating buyers. Across the country, about 50 communities are using John Schools. Atlanta, Georgia, and Baltimore, Maryland, are among dozens more cities that plan to launch similar programs by the end of the year.  See where the John Schools are » . ""It will make them [offenders] see that this is not a victimless crime, and they are contributing to the exploitation of women,"" said Stephanie Davis, policy adviser on women's issues at the mayor's office in Atlanta. ""It's hurting them, the man, and it's hurting their families and its hurting the community."" No comprehensive effort has been made to track the numbers, but experts estimate 1 million to 2 million prostitutes work in the United States. The FBI's 2007 Uniform Crime Report lists about 78,000 arrests for prostitution and commercialized vice, but experts say those numbers are extremely conservative because many sex workers and johns aren't caught. Experts add that easy accessibility to prostitutes and pornography on the Internet are feeding the problem. In most communities, prostitution has been a one-sided battle focused on the women who offer sex. Their customers, when they are arrested, are usually cited for a misdemeanor and fined. By comparison, prostitutes are often charged with more severe sentences and jailed for months, depending on the offense. But in Nashville, the johns' faces are shown on a police Web site. For decades, Nashville battled prostitution by arresting women on the streets and through stings. Still, the problem persisted, irritating business owners and residents. In the early 1990s, Nashville's mayor helped launch the John School with the help of the Magdalene House, public defenders, prosecutors and police officers. Nashville became one of the first major cities in the U.S. to focus on the customers, predominantly men. Only first-time offenders who solicit an adult are eligible for John School. Johns who pick up minors are not eligible and face much tougher sentences. ""If you get caught again and you get me, I will guarantee to put you in jail,"" warned Antoinette Welch, a local prosecutor, in speaking to the men in the class. ""I've had men cry to me that they will lose their jobs or their wives, but you're all grown up and you make your own decisions."" The men listened carefully as Welch talked about their records; many had not yet told their wives or significant others about their arrest. If the john pleads guilty, pays a $250 fee and completes the course without re-offending, the charge can be dismissed after a year. The money paid by the john goes to Magdalene House; the program doesn't cost taxpayers any money. John School models in other communities may differ. A woman who called herself Alexis, a 35-year-old former prostitute with dark hair and bright blue eyes, spoke to the men as the class came to an end. Four years ago, she left the streets and now works at a factory. By the age of 10, Alexis had learned to barter with sex with her stepfather. In her 20s, she found herself hooked on drugs and selling her body. She was arrested more than 80 times. She was hospitalized after someone shot her on the job. As she told her story, the men were silent. A few blushed, while others stared at the floor. ""These gentlemen are no different than I was on the streets,"" she said. ""I think everyone has to look at the void they are trying to fill."" One john, a father of two with salt-and-pepper hair, found himself near tears after Alexis spoke. In July, he tried to pick up a prostitute through Craigslist. He said he was depressed and having problems with his wife. ""I'm so embarrassed,"" he said. ""These girls are somebody's daughters. I have a daughter."" Some evidence suggests that John Schools are working. A study released in 2008 by Abt Associates Inc. for the federal government looked at the John School program in San Francisco, California. It's one of the largest programs in the country; more than 7,000 johns have attended since 1995. According to the study, the re-arrest rate fell sharply after the school was launched, and stayed more than 30 percent lower for 10 years afterward. But critics call John School a slap on the wrist. On Saturday, one john abandoned the classroom. Carol Leigh, a member of the Sex Workers Outreach Project, a group that promotes decriminalizing prostitution in California, said she doesn't believe the program is an effective deterrent. ""John School doesn't do that much,"" said Leigh, who has worked as a prostitute. ""The reality is they aren't spending that much time on the johns and they will just go to other venues. This also doesn't target the violent offenders who are the real problem."" Melissa Farley, head of the nonprofit group Prostitution Research and Education in San Fransisco, believes johns deserve stronger punishment like longer prison sentences. A recent study by the Chicago Alliance Against Sexual Exploitation conducted among johns in Chicago, Illinois, found that 41 percent of them said John School would deter them from buying sex, compared with 92 percent who said being placed on a sex offender registry would scare them from re-offending. Nashville officials said they haven't tracked recidivism rates in their city, but the school's program director said it's probably deterring a third of the offenders in each class. At least one college educated, 47-year-old john's attitude appeared to change on a recent Saturday. After class he wrote, ""There is no good part. I would rather be with my wife. This was quick but it wasn't worth it.""","Experts say about 1 million to 2 million prostitutes work in the United States .

"(CNN) -- For 13-year-old Brandon Marti, the intranasal vaccine felt ""good,"" ""cold"" and ""watery"" at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore in the Bronx, New York, on Tuesday. Brandon Marti, 13, receives a dose of the intranasal vaccine for the novel H1N1 flu Tuesday. Marti, among the first to get vaccinated against the novel H1N1 influenza virus this week, said he would tell his friends and classmates that ""the swine flu vaccine is good, and protects me from getting the swine flu."" New York has received a shipment of 68,000 doses of the FluMist variety vaccine. This form was made available before the injectable kind because it was ready first, said Thomas Skinner, spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As states across the country receive and distribute the vaccine, questions still linger about who should get it and why. Here are some guidelines: . Where is the vaccine? The campaign to inoculate millions of Americans against H1N1 flu began Monday. Every state is developing a vaccine delivery plan, according to the CDC.  How much do you know about H1N1? Take our quiz. » . All states in the United States have ordered vaccine, said Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the CDC, at a briefing Tuesday. Each Friday, the CDC will provide information about how much vaccine is available to states and how much has been ordered. So far, about 2.2 million doses out of the available 2.4 million have been ordered, he said. Learn more from your state. The vaccine is being made available as soon as it comes off the production line, Frieden said. This week the intranasal mist variety, called FluMist, became available, and next week the injectable form will made available, he said. iReport.com: Are you getting the H1N1 vaccine? Frieden acknowledged that these first few weeks will be ""bumpy"" in terms of distributing the vaccine, and that demand is currently greater than supply. However, he expects that supply will soon outstrip demand. ""It will take some time to get the whole system, from the manufacturer through the distributor to the providers and to people who want to get vaccinated, up and running,"" he said. Who should get it? The CDC recommends that specific groups of people get vaccinated first, but there are no rankings within the priority groups, Frieden said. The nasal spray version of the vaccine should be used only in people 2 to 49 and who do not have an underlying health problem, Frieden said. The priority groups for it include health care workers, children and people who care for infants, he said. Pregnant women should not have the FluMist version because it contains the live virus.  Kathleen Sebelius and CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta discuss H1N1 vaccine » . Ashley Marti, 9, sister of Brandon, also got her H1N1 vaccination Tuesday. Health care and emergency medical services personnel should be in the priority group because vulnerable patients could potentially contract the flu from them, the CDC said. Already, infections among health care workers have been reported, and the health care system capacity could become significantly lowered if large numbers of these workers are absent, the CDC said. Once the injectable shot becomes available, all priority groups should be vaccinated, the CDC said. These include pregnant women, because they are at higher risk of complications and may be able to provide protection to unvaccinated infants. People from 6 months to 24 years old should also receive the vaccine, and people from 25 to 64 should get it they have a chronic health disorder or a compromised immune system, the CDC said. According to a CNN/Opinion Corp. poll in late August, two-thirds of Americans said they plan to be vaccinated against H1N1 flu. Does anyone have to get it? There are no formal penalties for those who do not get the vaccine, but people in the military are required to receive it, according to the American Forces Press Service. The state government of New York has said that health care workers must get the vaccine, although no law outlines penalties for noncompliance. Still, some workers fear they'll lose their jobs if they don't get vaccinated. How many doses do you need? For people 10 and older, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of one dose of the vaccine. For children 9 and younger, two doses may be required, Frieden said. The CDC recommends that three to four weeks pass between the first and second dose. What if the virus mutates? Nathan Stein, 7, participated in a clinical trial for the H1N1 vaccine over the summer. The virus has not changed much since the spring, Frieden said. In fact, the part of the virus that determines whether it's very deadly is different from the part that determines whether the vaccine will fight against it, he said, meaning that vaccination will still most likely offer protection even if the H1N1 flu becomes more deadly. Why should you get it? Frieden said the flu can range from mild to severe. It can make a person sick for one, two or three days, leading to absence from school or work, and some people may even need hospitalization. ""Tragically, some people may die from it,"" he said. Still, it is not a disease that sends a lot of people to the hospital, he said. The vaccine is also safe, Frieden said. The novel flu vaccine is made in the same production facilities by the same companies with the same methods as the seasonal flu vaccine, and it is the same kind of vaccine that has been given each year, he said. His own children will get it, as will the families of other public health experts, he said. Some people are concerned that it is too late to get vaccinated against the novel virus, but Frieden also dismissed this. ""It's too soon to say it's too late because we don't know what the rest of the season will bring,"" he said. CNN's Elizabeth Cohen contributed to this report.","CDC: About 2.2 million doses out of the available 2.4 million have been ordered .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: One ship, two pirate attacks, different outcome this time around.  You'll see it in today's show! I'm Carl Azuz. CNN Student News starts right now! First Up: Senate Health Care Plan . AZUZ: First up, the Senate has come up with its plan to reform the U.S. health care system. The proposed bill, released last night. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says it would give health insurance to 30 million more Americans and would cost an estimated $849 billion over the next 10 years. Some senators now opposed to the bill are concerned about what it covers and how much it costs. Republicans have threatened to try and block the legislation from being passed. Debate on it could start as soon as Saturday. Afghan Inauguration . AZUZ: Hamid Karzai is scheduled to be sworn in today for his second term as the president of Afghanistan. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says this is a ""critical moment"" for that country, because it's a chance for Karzai to show what kind of government he'll lead. Clinton is visiting Afghanistan right now. She's scheduled to meet with Karzai while she's there. The Afghan president, under pressure to clean up corruption in his government, and Secretary Clinton is expected to talk with him about some guidelines that Afghanistan will have to meet in order to continue getting aid from the U.S. Clinton says that America wants to be partners with Afghanistan and with the Afghan people, and that is why President Obama has been reviewing the U.S. approach to the country. Nuclear Fears . AZUZ: No deal! That's what Iran seems to be saying about sending some of its nuclear materials to other countries. This plan was worked out at a meeting last month. Iran would send raw nuclear materials to other nations who would make it into nuclear fuel, and then that would go back to Iran to be used in medical facilities. But now, instead of sending out materials and getting them back later as fuel, one Iranian official is saying the country will only swap raw materials for already processed fuel, and the trade would have to happen in Iran.  All this is part of the ongoing tension over the Middle Eastern nation's nuclear program. Iran says it's only being used for peaceful reasons. But other countries believe Iran may be trying to build nuclear weapons. Terror Trial Debate . AZUZ: Well, there has been a lot of back-and-forth about the Obama Administration's decision to try a group of suspected 9/11 terrorists in a civilian court in New York City. A lot of people spoke out about this on our blog and in Congress, where Attorney General Eric Holder, who made the decision, talked about it yesterday. Samantha Hayes has our report on that. (BEGIN VIDEO) SAMANTHA HAYES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's a move that's sparked a raging debate. ALICE HOAGLAND, MOTHER OF 9/11 VICTIM: I think I can speak for many 9/11 families when I say that we are heartsick. HAYES: On Capitol Hill Wednesday, Attorney General Eric Holder defended his decision to try five suspected 9/11 terrorists -- including alleged mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed -- in a civilian court, not a military tribunal. ERIC HOLDER, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: It was a decision that was case-driven. It's a decision based on the evidence that I know, that frankly, some of the people who have criticized the decision do not have access to. HAYES: Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee led the intense criticism of Holder's decision. SENATOR JON KYL, (R) ARIZONA: How could you be more likely to get a conviction in federal court when Khalid Sheik Mohammed has already asked to plead guilty before a military commission and be executed? HAYES: But Democrats who support the move expressed confidence in the court system and the ability of the city of New York to handle the trials, even though it was the epicenter of the 9/11 attacks. SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, (D) CALIFORNIA: I happen to believe that New York City is able to handle this in a very professional and definitively legal manner. HAYES: And Holder said it in no way undermines the administration's commitment to fighting terror. HOLDER: We are at war, and we will use every instrument of national power -- civilian, military, law enforcement, intelligence, diplomatic and others -- to win. HAYES: Holder also told the panel that he is not concerned that a federal court could find the suspected terrorists not guilty. He said he has told prosecutors that these are cases that must be won.

MICHELLE WRIGHT, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. VandenHeuval's social studies classes at Dos Rios Elementary School in Tolleson, Arizona!

You've got three seconds -- GO! Today is Senator Robert Byrd's 20,775th day serving in Congress. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Congressional History . AZUZ: Six years in the House of Representatives; elected to the U.S. Senate nine terms -- only person ever to do that -- it makes Sen. Byrd's total time representing residents of West Virginia 51 years so far. Plus, he's turning 92 tomorrow. As he became the longest-serving member of Congress yesterday, Byrd's years of service were praised by Democrats and Republicans. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell talked about Sen. Byrd's love for both the country and the Congress. And Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid predicted that many of Byrd's records will never be broken. Somalia Pirates . AZUZ: Deja vu in waters off the coast of the African nation of Somalia, when pirates tried to hijack a ship called the Maersk Alabama. If that sounds familiar to you, it's because that was the same ship that was hijacked back in April. A Navy operation rescued the crew members in that incident. And yesterday, a private security team on board the Maersk kept the attempted hijackers from taking over. When we talk about pirates, we don't mean ""of the Caribbean."" These are very dangerous people with guns; they hold ships for ransom; they're very active in this part of the world. Is this Legit? MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? The African elephant is the largest animal on land. This one's true. These animals can grow to be 9 tons; that's 18,000 pounds! Elephant Orphanage . AZUZ: Okay -- that's the full-grown version, but even the babies are huge! African elephants can still weigh around 220 pounds at birth! But big doesn't necessarily mean safe. They're losing their habitat; they're being hunted by poachers: Baby elephants can face a lot of threats in the wild, and not having a mother around doesn't make it any easier. David McKenzie examines a program in Kenya that's trying to help orphaned elephants. (BEGIN VIDEO) DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: They grow up to be one of Africa's giants, but like all creatures, they start off pretty small. Dwarfed by their keepers, each orphaned elephant at the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has a tragic tale. This is Sala. She's 6 weeks old. They say her mother died because of starvation in the Kenyan drought. The person who found her gave her cow's milk, which is extremely harmful to elephants because of the fat. Sala wandered into a tourist camp in Kenya's Sala National Park, alone and confused. The orphanage scrambled a plane to rescue her. Carefully strapped in and traumatized, they evacuated Sala to Nairobi. For weeks, she was too sick to stand. Three days ago, she started walking again. If she makes it, she won't be alone. Drought, poaching and shrinking habitats have decimated elephant herds across East Africa. And the orphanage is fuller than it's been in 30 years. Still, Dame Daphne Sheldrick will take more. DAME DAPHNE SHELDRICK, DAVID SHELDRICK WILDLIFE TRUST: Whatever comes in, we have to make space. MCKENZIE: It takes years to rehabilitate and reintroduce the orphans into the wild. For the keepers, it's not just a 9 to 5 job. EDWIN LUSICHI, CHIEF KEEPER: But after working with these elephants, it's no longer just a job. It is from inside your heart, the love that you have for these animals. MCKENZIE: Every three hours, day and night, the keepers mix fortified soy milk for the elephants. It costs $900 a month to care for each orphan, so the elephants have to earn their keep. With a slap of sunscreen to protect their sensitive skin, the babies go on parade. They slush and slide for the throngs of tourists who see the fun, but not the heartbreak. MCKENZIE: So, they hope to lead these infants through their most fragile stage. It could take years before Sala joins a family of wild elephants. In the care of her human family, she might just make it. David McKenzie, CNN, Nairobi, Kenya. (END VIDEO) Impact Your World .

"(CNN) -- Shel Israel is not the kind of person you'd expect to find on Twitter all day. He's 65. Shel Israel, author of a new book on Twitter. He says the micro-blogging service changed his life. But Israel has been using the micro-blogging service longer than most. In fact, he gave up his lifelong habit of reading the newspaper every day about four years ago and turned exclusively to social media. He now knows how to use Twitter, how not to use it, and how to benefit from it, and he says Twitter has changed his life. The social-media journalist and public speaker is the author of  a new book, ""Twitterville: How Businesses Can Thrive in the New Global Neighborhoods."" The book shows how Twitter flattens geographical boundaries and helps people connect with others around the world who share their interests. To Israel, it's the mundane details of one's life, shared through tweets and status updates, that matter. He believes that tweeting about what you had for lunch can actually help build a meaningful personal or business relationship. Israel also says that who you follow on Twitter is much more important than the number of people who follow you. That's because the people you follow become ""your newspaper -- the way you get the information that you see, that you digest, and that you use."" Here is an edited version of the conversation. CNN: Your timing in writing this book seems perfect -- Twitter just blew up. Did you see this boom coming? Israel: Yeah I did, but not with this great prescience. I just thought it was going to get bigger and bigger, and I thought there was a value to Twitter that no other social media tool had.  See part of our chat with Israel here » . What are those values you mentioned that only Twitter has? There are two values and they're closely intertwined. The first is that Twitter lets people behave online more closely to how we behave in real life than anything that ever preceded it in history. It's kind of past now, but there was this whole wave of admonition of nobody cares what you had for lunch, and to be honest that's absolutely false. If I said that I was in a restaurant in Atlanta, [Georgia,] you'd say, ""Oh, where did you go? You didn't by chance try the..."" and we have a conversation that way. We care about the details of life. When you bring this into business, I don't think many members of your audience ever bought or sold anything from a conversation that starts with, ""Are you going to buy something?"" It begins with small talk. And that brings us to the second point. The brevity creates an interaction that no other media tool allows. Until now most social media is I write or create something, and you read it and comment back. In Twitter, it's so brief that no one is the lead conversationalist, really. And it isn't about what you post in 140 characters, it's about the number of spoonfuls of content that you feed people who are interested in eating it. Why are you so fascinated by Twitter? Most people your age don't use social media at all. I was born too soon? (Laughs) I don't know what it is about me, but it's what drew me to Silicon Valley in the first place -- I just get turned on by new ideas and new trends. I am extremely curious by nature. I like meeting people who think and act differently than I do. And that I think keeps me young, along with the fact that I spend much of my time with people younger than me. And they seem to value the fact that this older guy has some wisdom, but they don't understand how much I'm learning from them. You tell a lot of specific Twitter anecdotes in your book. Do you have a favorite character? I have a few real favorites. [One is] Janis Krums, who was the 23-year-old guy taking a ferry to New Jersey when a funny thing happened -- the US Airways flight 1549 landed [on the Hudson River] a couple of football fields away from him. He whips out an iPhone, uses a 30-day-old product called Twit Pic, and takes a picture. Twenty-seven minutes later he's on national TV, the photo he took is the backdrop, and his voice is being heard nationally through the iPhone that he used. I asked him how his life had changed by becoming the most famous citizen journalist of at least 2009. And his answer to me was, ""You know, I didn't plan to be a citizen journalist, I just wanted to go to New Jersey."" And that might have been my single favorite answer to any question. You also describe why certain strategies work for particular organizations in your book. Are there Twitter marketing strategies that wouldn't work for some companies? Yeah, I talk a lot about changing of eras. We're going [away] from the broadcast era -- that's when content is sandwiched by messages to pay for the experience, and those messages are in the form of advertising or PR or other marketing tactics. And most people don't like them anymore, and we use our Tivo and our spam filters to avoid as many of these messages as possible. In social media, if companies come up and try to treat [Twitter] as just an extension of their marketing solutions, they will fail. What they need to do in social media is join the conversation rather than start the conversation, and not make it about themselves. They need to tell what they're doing rather than sell what they're doing. And that's a fundamental change. We're going into a conversational era, which is bi-directional. What would you say to employers who don't let their employees use social media like Twitter and Facebook during work hours? Whenever something new comes into the marketplace, there are companies that are really in love with the way it's always been done. When you start banning things, you're showing a natural distrust of your employees, which is, even in tough times, not an intelligent way to treat your employees. And the second thing is they're banishing the state-of-the-art communications tool. What's the future of Twitter, in your opinion? A year from now, Twitter will be more of an everyday experience -- the need to meet up, to talk will move on to something that we don't know about yet. My vision for Twitter is that employees of your age coming into the workplace will be shown a desk, a computer ...[and set up their social media accounts] and then be told to go to work and use [Twitter] how they see fit to get the job done.","Shel Israel is the author of a new book about how to get the most out of Twitter .

"HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON, New York (CNN) -- In 2002, Pam Koner was flipping through the The New York Times when a photograph stopped her in her tracks: an 8-year-old girl laying across her torn, barren mattress in Pembroke, Illinois, forking pasta and a boiled chicken bone into her mouth. The girl's image signified the deep-rooted poverty in her rural community. Pam Koner is combating hunger by connecting sponsor and recipient families. The picture moved Koner to tears and inspired her to take action. ""When I read about a community so profoundly poor that women and children were not eating the last week of the month, I walked into my living room where my daughters were and said, 'We're going to do something as a family,' "" recalls Koner, a 57-year-old single mother of two living in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. In the seven years since, Koner's determination to help families in Pembroke led to the creation of Family-to-Family, a nonprofit that connects more than 600 sponsor and recipient families in 13 communities nationwide. Do you know someone who should be a CNN Hero? Nominations are open at CNN.com/Heroes. The project began with Koner contacting an outreach worker in Pembroke, who told her the town needed food more than anything else. Koner enlisted help from her neighbors and parents of children in her childcare business; the group began sending monthly boxes of food and basic household items to the neediest families in the Illinois town. ""People were excited to be a part of something,"" says Koner of her donor community. ""Something so little as shopping, packing and sending a box."" Through monthly food donations, Koner's organization has provided nearly 800,000 meals to struggling families across the country. For privacy purposes, she says, the group makes sure donor and recipient communities are at a distance, such as an Atlanta, Georgia, chapter helping a community in Kentucky or a Florida family helping a Navajo family in New Mexico. In addition to providing basic essentials, families exchange letters, swap photographs and share stories about cultural traditions and family events. ""There's a shared learning experience,"" says Koner. ""When a sponsoring family reads about a Navajo family lifestyle -- barren landscape, a trailer home with no electricity and no running water -- children get a profound, firsthand look at differences. Knowing that each other exists changes the way we look at the world.""  Watch Koner describe how the communities connect with each other » . The economic downturn has prompted Koner's group to broaden its outreach and sponsorship methods. Bedford-Stuyvesant, a community in Brooklyn, New York, of predominantly working-class African-Americans, is the group's only urban sponsored community. It is also one of the organization's cyber-adoption sites, where sponsor families participate through Paypal, an online money exchange tool. A food pantry buys and boxes up the food to give directly to the families. Koner also learned of families in her own Hastings-on-Hudson community in need of help. ""I was quite surprised,"" Koner says. ""Hastings is probably middle-class to upper-middle-class. It's not a showy community, but this was a community of families who were not in need of help before."" Her community has eagerly embraced its neighbors in need, she says, but unlike traditional sponsored families at a distance, Hastings-sponsored families presented privacy concerns. ""That there could be a child who was going to school with my child who I was helping ... we felt that was too personal and private. To respect the individual family in need [was] important for us since we live so close together,"" says Koner. To help maintain their anonymity, donations for the 11 sponsored families in Hastings are labeled by letters of the alphabet, so sponsor families have no identifiable information about who they're helping.  Watch how kids in Koner's town are helping to feed far-away families » . Despite economic challenges, Koner says she's noticed growing enthusiasm among families to become sponsors in her own community and beyond. ""I anticipated that we would really be affected, people would drop out. But that hasn't happened. We've actually launched new chapters of sponsoring families."" Koner attributes the outpouring of generosity to a heightened awareness for how tough times present a new outlook on giving.  Watch Koner and some sponsor families in action » . ""There are plenty of communities where families are struggling themselves, but will keep this as part of their budget,"" she says. ""We're all affected. No one knows what's going to happen tomorrow.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Federal safety investigators said Tuesday they fear flaws found in Washington's Metro subway system after a deadly crash this summer may endanger other transit systems, and they sent out an urgent recommendation asking that other rail operators check for similar problems. Investigators are shown at the crash scene in Washington. Nine people were killed in the June 22 wreck. In letters to federal regulators, the National Transportation Safety Board said ""all rail transit operators and railroads should be informed"" about system flaws that could cause a track circuit to fail to detect a train. It was not clear how many rail systems have similar train detection systems. Neither the NTSB nor the Federal Transit Administration had a list of systems that use the ""audio frequency track circuits"" that are the focus of the probe. But an FTA spokesman said that because it doesn't know how many operators use the systems, ""we are sending today's urgent recommendation to all rail transit operators, and will identify the pertinent operators through a later survey."" Meanwhile, the Federal Railway Administration, which regulates Amtrak and more than a dozen commuter rail systems, said it also will follow the NTSB guidance but believes the number of impacted systems will be ""limited."" Nine people were killed and 52 taken to hospitals June 22 when a southbound Metrorail train struck the rear end of stopped train just north of the Fort Totten station. Investigators say an automatic train protection system did not detect the stopped train, so the moving train did not receive a command to slow or stop. The NTSB said it is continuing its investigation into the precise causes of the crash, but it said the investigation has raised concerns that the track circuit is susceptible to errant signals. In its letter to regulators, the NTSB said it discovered one circumstance in which an unintended signal path could be created, resulting in a track relay remaining energized even though a stopped train was occupying the circuit. ""After only three months, this complex investigation is far from complete, so we are not ready to determine the probable cause of the [Metro] accident,"" NTSB Chairwoman Deborah A.P. Hersman said. ""However, our findings so far indicate a pressing need to issue these recommendations to immediately address safety glitches we have found that could lead to another tragic accident."" The NTSB sent letters to Metro, the Federal Transit Administration, the Federal Railroad Administration and Alstom Signaling Inc., which acquired General Railway Signal, the manufacturer of some of the equipment.","NTSB, investigating fatal D.C. train crash, cites flaw in train detection system .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Race and politics are a combustible combo that explodes into headlines when an ex-president lights the fuse, as Jimmy Carter did recently. President Obama during the 2008 campaign faced questions over race and politics. ""When a radical fringe element of demonstrators and others begin to attack the president of the United States as an animal or as a reincarnation of Adolf Hitler or when they wave signs in the air that said we should have buried Obama with Kennedy, those kinds of things are beyond the bounds,"" the Democrat told students at Emory University on Wednesday. ""I think people who are guilty of that kind of personal attack against Obama have been influenced to a major degree by a belief that he should not be president because he happens to be African-American,"" he added. The controversy erupted this week when Carter first raised the race issue to NBC. ""An overwhelming portion of the intensely demonstrated animosity toward President Obama is based on the fact that he is a black man,"" he said. Bill Cosby, a black comedian and actor, said Wednesday in a written statement that he agrees with Carter. ""During President Obama's speech on the status of health care reform, some members of Congress engaged in a public display of disrespect,"" he said. CNN contributor David Gergen said that some of the allegations of race-baiting might have some weight among Democratic voters. ""Jimmy Carter, I'm afraid, is not alone in his views,"" he said. But Gergen warns that the racists tend to be on the fringes of the right and do not reflect on the greater field of opponents to Obama's ideology. ""But I think it's wrongheaded, and I think it's unfair, and I think it's indeed a libel upon many of the opponents, most of the opponents of health care reform, to say that they're racist,"" he said. ""Seven previous presidents have tried to bring health care reforms of this kind. All seven have failed. And, as I recall, all seven were white."" Carter's comments, though, are the kind that raise people's defenses. In particular, they turn off independents, who by nature tend to hate the hard edges of politics. The White House, for its part, wants no part of the Carter controversy. ""The president does not believe that that criticism comes based on the color of his skin,"" said White House press secretary Robert Gibbs. As a candidate, Obama understood the political danger in letting his race become a major topic. He largely avoided it when he could, but race was always a subtext, as it is now in his presidency. ""But I can also say, frankly, that this White House and even his campaign were very afraid to even go down this road dealing with anything with race,"" said CNN contributor Roland Martin. Carter also told NBC that there is an ""inherent feeling among many people in this country that an African-American ought not to be president and ought not to be given the same respect as if he were white."" Framing criticism as racism cropped up several times during the campaign. When Geraldine Ferraro, a Clinton supporter, said during the 2008 Democratic primaries that Obama would never have gotten as far as he had if he had not been black, candidate Obama pointedly left race out of it. ""I think that her comments were ridiculous,"" Obama said at the time. But Ferraro blamed Obama supporters for her hate mail, saying ""I have been called all kinds of names. And the attacks are ageist. They're sexist. They're racist."" iReport.com: Freedom from speech? And the topic of race even came to haunt Bill Clinton, the so-called first black president. Before the New Hampshire primary in January 2008, Clinton told an audience that ""there's no difference in [Obama's] voting record and Hillary's ever since. Give me a break. This whole thing is the biggest fairy tale I have ever seen."" Some interpreted that as belittling Obama's campaign. After much criticism, Clinton later said he was talking about Obama's opposition to the war in Iraq, not his campaign. But those two words -- ""fairy tale"" -- launched weeks worth of accusations, sometimes on the front page of The New York Times, that the Clintons were playing the race card. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on race and politics . Some observers said Carter's statement was far too broad, and that many of the attacks on Obama are about policy, not race. ""I don't think one can paint a broad brush in saying that all of these folks who have criticism, anybody who criticizes the president ... is based upon the issue of race,"" Martin said. Mary Matalin, a CNN contributor and Republican strategist, said Carter's criticism is ""absurd."" ""It's very dangerous politics,"" she said. ""Barack Obama got, in the last election, more white male voters than any of his predecessors. ... Republicans and conservatives and Democrats and liberals, the whole country felt very good putting -- setting aside policies after his election.""","Former President Carter says criticism of Obama is largely based on race .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The White House refused to indicate Monday whether President Obama will issue a posthumous pardon for Jack Johnson, the African-American boxing champion convicted in 1913 for dating a white woman. Jack Johnson's 1910 defeat of Jim Jeffries, the ""Great White Hope,"" sparked riots. The House of Representatives on July 29 unanimously passed a resolution urging Obama to grant a pardon; the Senate passed a similar measure by a voice vote on June 24. The push for a rare posthumous pardon has been spearheaded for years by Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, and Rep. Peter King, R-New York, two of Congress' top boxing enthusiasts. ""It is our hope that you will be eager to agree to right this wrong and erase an act of racism that sent an American citizen to prison,"" they wrote Friday in a letter to Obama. Johnson, the first African-American to win the heavyweight title, was convicted for violating the Mann Act, which outlawed the transportation of women across state lines for ""immoral"" purposes. He served 10 months in prison on charges ""brought forward clearly to keep him away from the boxing ring, where he continued to defeat his white opponents,"" McCain and King said. Almost a century after Johnson's conviction, his compelling saga has continued to capture the interest of sports writers, civil rights activists and historians. It provides, they agree, a unique window into American politics and culture at a time when Jim Crow-style racism reigned supreme. Johnson was first arrested for breaking the Mann Act in 1912, four years after winning the heavyweight crown. That case fell apart, but investigators soon after charged him with a similar offense involving a woman he had dated years earlier. Justice Department lawyers argued it was a ""crime against nature"" for him to have a sexual relationship with a white woman. Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, later to become the first commissioner of Major League Baseball, set Johnson's bail at $30,000, the equivalent of more than $660,000 today. When a bail bondsman showed up, Landis jailed him, too, according to an account that filmmaker Ken Burns relays in his documentary ""Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson."" An all-white jury convicted Johnson in less than two hours. ""Mr. Johnson was perhaps persecuted as an individual, but ... it was his misfortune to be the foremost example of the evil in permitting the intermarriage of whites and blacks,"" one of the prosecutors later said. Johnson's real crime, in the eyes of many, was committed on July 4, 1910, when he successfully defended his boxing title against Jim Jeffries, a white boxer who came to be called the ""Great White Hope"" because many white fans saw him as the best chance to wrest back a boxing title from the African-American champ. Johnson beat Jeffries, who had come out of retirement for the fight, before a stunned, almost entirely white crowd in Reno, Nevada. Race riots followed. More than 20 people were killed and hundreds were injured. Most victims were black. So when they ""couldn't beat him in the ring, the white power establishment decided to beat him in the courts,"" Burns said in his documentary. Johnson fled to Europe in 1913 while free on appeal. But after years of fights overseas, including the eventual loss of his title in Havana, Cuba, in 1915, Johnson came home. He turned himself over to U.S. authorities at the Mexican border in 1920 and served 10 months in prison. He died in a car wreck in 1946. ""Back then, if you were black and you were told that you did something wrong, you really had no recourse,"" Linda Haywood, Johnson's great-niece, recently told CNN. ""You just accepted what was done because black people were basically powerless and voiceless. Jack may have been a rich boxer, but he couldn't fight the system."" McCain and King introduced resolutions calling for a presidential pardon in 2005 and last year. McCain, who says he made a mistake by once voting against a federal holiday for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., sees the pardon as a way to right an old wrong. ""The Jack Johnson case is an ignominious stain on our nation's history,"" he said on the Senate floor in the spring. ""Rectifying this injustice is long overdue. [The resolution recognizes] the unjustness of what transpired, and sheds light on the achievements of an athlete who was forced into the shadows of bigotry and prejudice.""","Jack Johnson, the African-American boxing champion, convicted in 1913 .

"(CNN) -- Much has been written about the Obamas' marriage. The president and first lady have attested to the long and hard work it takes to stay involved and connected to each other while maintaining their separate identities. Undoubtedly, sustaining a marriage is sometimes hard, as the first lady noted. But the Obamas are an excellent example of how the fruits of marriage can be realized by those who are committed to reconciling their differences and ""toughing it out."" The problem is that, today, too few couples are willing to make such a commitment. Ever since California became the first state to sanction no-fault divorce law 40 years ago, with every state in essence following suit -- some with certain stipulations -- the most fundamental thread in the fabric of our American values, the institution of marriage, has been unraveling. Before I retired from the bench a few months ago, it was my job as a judge to sort through all the issues rising, in part, from the growing lack of reverence many Americans have for marriage. In court, I often saw humanity's worst behavior. I also dealt with teenage mothers, absentee fathers and parents who have never been married, often by choice. I saw parents who didn't seem able or willing to connect their children's problems with their own failure to provide their children with the necessary road map to self-sufficiency and productivity. And these families didn't just show up in my courtroom. They exist everywhere. The U.S. Marriage Index shows a dramatic decline in the health of marriage in recent decades. America is a society that requires its citizens to make choices and penalizes them, often harshly, for the wrong ones. As a child grows up, the guideposts should be: finish school; become a productive citizen; marry a person you want to spend your life with; and, if you want, have children. In that order. But many Americans are failing their children because they have already failed themselves. They often enter the court system with domestic problems and low-wage jobs, slim educational credentials and no life partners. It broke my heart to see so many children raising babies before they are ready: young people who made no connection between the poverty and chaos in their lives and the choices they had made. My options in addressing these problems from the bench were limited. The courtroom is seldom the stage at which social change takes place. By the time these cases appeared in court, so much damage had already been done. What our society needs is a solution on the front end. We should begin by considering six points: . Let's stop glorifying single parenthood. Celebrity unwed parents like ""Brangelina,"" Halle Berry and the late Michael Jackson make matrimony seem unimportant and suggest that having a baby as a single parent is ""cool"" and even easy. Our children need a reality check. Many young people think that having a child means that they will finally have someone who will unconditionally love them. They don't consider, however, that babies do not and cannot love anyone but themselves, and they also take a tremendous amount of time, attention and resources. Memo to single mothers by choice: When you decide to have a child alone in order to fulfill your deep need to parent, you may be deliberately substituting your emotional loss for that of your child, who will have to grow up without a father. We need to respect the role of men as husbands and fathers when they do right by their families. Boys and girls need their fathers to love them and to model the sacrifice and commitment that bonds a married couple. Men who ""man up"" like this need our support and encouragement. Our state legislatures should revisit no-fault divorce laws that allow one party to a marriage to opt out of it too easily. Change now can result in change in the future. Although there are many success stories, children who grow up in single-parent families are less likely to enjoy the financial security, educational success and social skills of children living with their married parents. This only continues to fuel poverty and inequality in our country. By the way, I'm neither a strait-laced goody-two-shoes nor Archie Bunker in heels. I would never condemn anyone who has had a child out of wedlock or who has gone through a divorce. I was a divorcee, and with two children, I was also a single mom. So I know that these things happen. Indeed, sometimes they must happen. And because they do, we need to respect every family form. But I've been around long enough to know that as marriage goes, so go our children. And with them goes the future of our country. Consequently, everyone -- rich or poor, single or married or divorced, gay or straight, all races and colors, from the first family to the single-parent family -- benefits from a vibrant marriage culture.

"MEXICO City, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican federal authorities have arrested 124 law enforcement officials in Hidalgo state on suspicion of being linked to the Zetas drug cartel, considered the nation's most ruthless and dangerous crime syndicate. Mexican police, shown here last month awaiting transport of a cartel suspect, have cracked down on drug trafficking. Most of those arrested were municipal police officers, but there also were some high-level state and federal officials, according to the Mexico attorney general's office. Among them were Juan Antonio Franco Bustos, chief of coordination for Hidalgo state security; Julñio Cesar Sanchez Amador, head of public security in the city of Mineral de la Reforma; Mario Hernandez Almonasi, director of the auto theft unit for the state ministerial police; Raul Batres Campos, regional chief for the Federal Investigation Agency; and Jose Esteban Olvera Jimenez, a deputy director with the state security service, the attorney general's office said. Hidalgo is in central Mexico. Los Zetas was formed about 10 years ago by Mexican army commandos but now consists mainly of former local, state and federal police. ""The Zetas have obviously assumed the role of being the No. 1 organization responsible for the majority of the homicides, the narcotic-related homicides, the beheadings, the kidnappings, the extortions that take place in Mexico,"" said Ralph Reyes, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency's chief for Mexico and Central America.","Those arrested include police officers, high-level state and federal officials .

"Washington (CNN) -- Nearly two years into the recession, opinion about which political party is responsible for the severe economic downturn is shifting, according to a new national poll. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Friday morning indicates that 38 percent of the public blames Republicans for the country's current economic problems. In May, 53 percent blamed the GOP. According to the poll, 27 percent now blame the Democrats for the recession, up 6 points from May, and 27 percent now say both parties are responsible. ""The bad news for the Democrats is that the number of Americans who hold the GOP exclusively responsible for the recession has been steadily falling by about two to three points per month,"" said Keating Holland, CNN polling director. ""At that rate, only a handful of voters will blame the economy on the Republicans by the time next year's midterm elections roll around.."" Thirty-six percent of people questioned said that President Obama's policies have improved economic conditions, with 28 percent feeling that the president's programs have made things worse, and 35 percent saying what he's done has had no effect on the economy. One reason for that, Holland said, may be the growing federal budget deficit: Two-thirds say that the government should balance the budget even in a time of war and recession. The survey indicates that only 18 percent said the economic conditions in the country today are good, down 3 points from August. Eighty-two percent said economic conditions are poor. ""Some economic indicators may suggest that the economy has turned the corner -- but try telling that to the American people,"" Holland said. The number of Americans who said the economy is in good shape -- a number that grew steadily through the spring and summer -- has now stalled, with fewer than one in five expressing a positive view of current conditions. More than eight in 10 say that economic conditions are in poor shape, with 43 percent calling them very poor. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted November 13-15, with 1,014 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.

"(CNN) -- They kept their bodies alive with rationed crackers, bubble gum, beer and three gallons of water. But spiritually, the three men lost at sea for eight days had something else to keep them going. The family of the missing boaters put these photos on flyers shortly after they went missing. ""We just kept praying, and we kept hope alive,"" rescued boater Tressel Hawkins told CNN on Monday. ""Even though hope had managed to thread down to a little bitty string, I mean, that little bitty string could be just as strong as the rope you hung on to the first time you got started."" What was supposed to be a fishing expedition to catch swordfish and marlin became instead a test of survival. Hawkins, 43, and his fellow boaters, Curtis Hall, 28, and James Phillips, 30, set out on August 21 from Matagorda Bay in Texas and went about 100 miles south. Their first night in the Gulf of Mexico almost proved fatal. While Hawkins was sleeping, he said, he felt the bean bag he was resting on floating. He awoke to find water in the 23-foot catamaran knee-high. The water extractor had malfunctioned. He woke up Hall and Phillips and they tried to stop the flooding but it was too late, Hawkins said.  Watch CNN's Fredricka Whitfield talk to Hawkins » . As Hall had the radio in his hand to call for help, the boat capsized, Phillips told CNN affiliate KHOU-TV. They were ""shocked,"" Phillips said. Hall was responsible for rationing the food they had on board and the fresh water that sat in a tank on the boat, Hawkins said. They didn't like it, but they had to follow his rules to survive, he said. ""And being that you don't really know when you're going to get rescued, you have to ration it down to the bare essentials, and he stuck to his guns on that,"" Hawkins said. And with only those bare essentials, they waited and they prayed but they didn't give up. The three had lifejackets, flares and handmade flags. They used T-shirts and railing they ripped off the boat to create the flags, Hawkins said. They waved at boats and helicopters they saw, but the pilots didn't see them, Hall said.  Watch two other fishermen describe ordeal » . ""We tried flaggin' everybody we could, but I guess it was not our time to go home yet. They'd come straight at us, we'd be like 'Hey,' and there they'd go,"" Hall told KHOU. ""I was like, well, you know the good man above, either he's teaching us a lesson or showing us something. And finally, when that boat came, it was just ... I don't know."" ""It was a miracle,"" Phillips said, finishing Hall's sentence. One day after the Coast Guard called off a weeklong search for the men, the trio spotted a private vessel in the distance. They waved their flags and this time they were seen, Hawkins said. The Coast Guard said it combed more than 86,000 square miles looking for the men . When the crew of the private boat found the three sitting on top of their capsized catamaran, they were about 180 miles from Port Aransas, Texas, which is at the entrance to Corpus Christi Bay. None of the men suffered serious injuries despite all they had endured. In fact, Hawkins said he wouldn't be against going fishing again very soon. ""I would love to do it this weekend, but we made a pact when we made it back to the house that we're going to put the poles down for the rest of the year and try to do something else, maybe go deer hunting or something like that.""","Three fishermen spent week on on capsized boat in Gulf of Mexico .

"(CNN) -- Conan O'Brien suggested in a statement Tuesday that he will not accept NBC's proposal to move him and ""The Tonight Show,"" which he's hosted for seven months, to 12:05 a.m. ET. NBC has proposed moving ""The Tonight Show"" from its traditional 11:35 p.m. slot so that the show's former host, Jay Leno, could host a half-hour show then. ""My staff and I have worked unbelievably hard and we are very proud of our contribution to the legacy of 'The Tonight Show.'

""There has been speculation about my going to another network but, to set the record straight, I currently have no other offer and honestly have no idea what happens next. My hope is that NBC and I can resolve this quickly so that my staff, crew, and I can do a show we can be proud of, for a company that values our work."" Read O'Brien's full statement . After Leno left ""The Tonight Show"" last year -- as part of an agreement reached six years ago giving it to O'Brien -- he began hosting ""The Jay Leno Show"" for NBC in the fall, airing at 10 p.m. ET. But ratings for the 10 p.m. show were low, and on Sunday, NBC announced that it was taking Leno out of the prime-time slot because the show ""didn't meet affiliates' needs"" despite performing at acceptable levels for the network. The last show will air February 11 to make way for the 2010 Winter Olympics, which airs starting February 12. Jeff Gaspin, chairman of NBC Universal Television Entertainment, said the plan was for Leno to host a new, half-hour show at 11:35 p.m. ET, followed by ""Tonight"" with O'Brien at 12:05 a.m. and Jimmy Fallon's ""Late Night"" show moving to 1 a.m. As of Sunday, NBC was still negotiating with the three hosts over the proposed lineup. iReport: Share your view on the late-night shakeup . O'Brien, in his statement Tuesday, said the plan wasn't acceptable. ""For 60 years the 'Tonight Show' has aired immediately following the late local news. I sincerely believe that delaying 'The Tonight Show' into the next day to accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting,"" O'Brien said. "" 'The Tonight Show' at 12:05 simply isn't 'The Tonight Show.' ""Also, if I accept this move I will be knocking the 'Late Night' show, which I inherited from David Letterman and passed on to Jimmy Fallon, out of its long-held time slot. That would hurt the other NBC franchise that I love, and it would be unfair to Jimmy."" Fox's president of entertainment, Kevin Reilly, told reporters on Monday that his network may be interested in O'Brien should he leave ""Tonight.""

"(CNN) -- Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin held talks with Chinese counterpart Wen Jiabao in Beijing Tuesday, as the two countries agreed to bilateral economic and trade deals worth $4 billion, Chinese state media reported. Wen hosted a welcome ceremony for Putin at the Great Hall of the People at the start of a three-day visit, before their private talks and a larger session involving ministers from both sides, Xinhua said. ""Russia and China have become genuine and comprehensive strategic and cooperative partners in recent years,"" Putin was quoted by Xinhua as saying. Bilateral relations have become stable and mature since the forging of diplomatic ties 60 years ago and particularly the establishment of the Russia-China strategic cooperative partnership in 1996, Wen told reporters. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Zhukov said the deals included two $500-million-dollar banking deals -- one involving Russia's Vnesheconombank (VEB) and the China Development Bank and the other between Russia's VTB bank and the Agricultural Bank of China, Agence France-Presse reported. Chinese and Russian negotiators also met Tuesday ""to exchange views on China-Russia energy cooperation,"" according to a Chinese foreign ministry statement. In April, the two countries signed agreements on oil cooperation, while a memorandum of understanding on natural gas cooperation in followed in June. But negotiations over the pricing of the gas have reportedly remained a major obstacle to a final deal, AFP said. However, Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan, who met with Zhukov at a joint economic forum earlier Tuesday, told reporters that the China-Russia oil pipeline project was going smoothly and the loan China pledged to Russia had been implemented, Xinhua said. The construction on the China section of an oil pipeline from Siberia started in May. The 1,030-kilometer (640-mile) pipeline runs from Skovorodino, Russia, to the city of Daqing in northeastern China. It is expected to go into operation by the end of 2010 and carry 15 million tons of crude oil annually from Russia to China from 2011 to 2030, Xinhua added.","China's premier Wen Jiabao meets Vladimir Putin in Beijing .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Demonstrators entered their third day of a building takeover at UC Santa Cruz on Saturday in protest of a tuition increase, an undertaking that a school spokesman called futile. The occupation of Kerr Hall is just one of several demonstrations across University of California campuses this week after the regent's board approved a 32 percent increase in tuition Thursday. University officials said the $505 million to be raised by the tuition increases is needed to prevent even deeper cuts than those already made due to California's persistent financial crisis. Protesting students said the increase will hurt working and middle-class students who benefit from state-funded education. On the Santa Cruz campus, where building occupations began last week with a library sit-in, about 100 students staged a sit-in in the second-floor lobby of Kerr Hall soon after hearing that the tuition increase had been approved, according to UC Santa Cruz Provost David Kliger. The students made a list of 20 ""demands"" detailing how they want the administration to increase funding, spokesman Barry Shiller said. But the school has no plans to negotiate the demands with the student body, he said. The school just doesn't have the money, he added. School officials hope the students realize that their demonstration is ""not accomplishing anything"" and is ""just a disruption"" to administrative duties on campus, he said. The administration will continue to wait out the takeover, but Shiller said he is unsure of how long it will last. The school hopes the students will leave voluntarily, he said. Are you there? Share your story, video . Meanwhile, uprisings on other campuses have quieted since earlier mass demonstrations. At UC Berkeley on Friday night, 41 protesters occupying a building were arrested. Authorities decided to cite them for trespassing and release them rather than take them to jail, per an agreement with student leaders, school spokeswoman Claire Holmes said. Three students were arrested there Friday morning. Fifty-two students were arrested at UC Davis late Thursday after they refused to vacate the school's administration building. And UCLA's Campbell Hall was occupied for several hours Thursday evening. The angry students are condemning a nearly $2,000 tuition increase. The first change, which takes effect in January, will raise undergraduate tuition to $8,373. The second increase kicks in next fall, raising tuition to $10,302, university spokeswoman Leslie Sepuka said. Students who live on campus could pay an estimated $17,200 in additional fees that include the annual cost of books and housing, according to the system's July 2008 finance guide. The January increase of about 15 percent is more than double the average public university tuition increase last year. On average, tuition and fees at four-year public universities nationwide increased 6.5 percent, or to $7,020, since the previous school year, according to data from College Board. Students eligible for financial aid and whose families make less than $70,000 will have their tuition covered, the university said.","Students continue to occupy UC-Santa Cruz hall in protest of fee increases .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- A desperate Zimbabwean farmer fighting to hold onto his land -- a year after the country's political rivals pledged to govern jointly -- fears he will eventually lose to politics and violence. Ben Freeth's farm was gutted by fire, as was his father-in-law's. The power-sharing agreement included an undertaking by both parties to ensure property rights are upheld but farm attacks and invasions continue unabated in Zimbabwe. Charles Lock is one of an estimated 400 farmers who have remained in the country despite President Robert Mugabe's policy of redistributing white-owned farms to landless blacks. ""Why do they want to remove me when I've complied with everything they want? What more do they want other than for me to pack my bags and leave and if that's the case, then admit that that is the policy. Pass a law: no whites are allowed to farm. Then it makes it clear,"" Lock said. Since 2000, Mugabe's controversial land reform program has driven more than 4,000 commercial farmers off their land, destroying Zimbabwe's once prosperous agricultural sector. ""When the land reform program began, we decided we were not going to have a confrontational attitude; that we would actually go along with this program because it was the only way that this whole thing would be sorted out. So I voluntarily gave away my own farm and moved onto my father-in-law's farm,"" Lock said. That was in 2002. A year later the government came knocking on his door again, he said, demanding more land. Lock told CNN he eventually gave up 70 percent of his father-in-law's farm, which he then owned. Now an army general is demanding Lock's remaining 30 percent. When Zimbabwe's new unity government was formed -- with Mugabe's ZANU-PF and Morgan Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change -- in February this year, the general allegedly posted soldiers on Lock's farm. The farmer said he stopped farming and trade at gun point. When CNN visited Lock's farm this month, workers were standing idle. Maize and tobacco, which Lock said is worth more than U.S. $1 million, lay in storage. ""They've switched off our irrigation system, taken out keys and stop our trucks if we want to deliver maize,"" he told CNN. So Lock had to sneak into his own property like a thief by cutting open the gate leading to his store room. He took a few valuables from his workshop suspecting that his whole place will soon be looted. With the formation of a unity government farmers were hoping for some protection but Lock said: ""Nothing is happening here. There is no land audit happening, no one comes out here to check, to see. We are just left vulnerable."" On another farm, Ben Freeth's fight for his land has just escalated to another level. Freeth has been repeatedly beaten, arrested and harassed. Now his farmhouse and that of his father-in-law have been gutted by a mysterious fire. See the destruction the fire caused . Freeth could not say for sure that this is arson but told CNN that the group of ZANU-PF youths who have occupied his farm have repeatedly threatened to burn his house. ""One time they came round with burning sacks at night and they started making a huge noise and ringing a great big bell and shouting and screaming. They were going underneath the thatch saying we are going to burn your house down if you don't get out,"" he said. Freeth and his father-in-law Mike Campbell are among a group of Zimbabwean farmers who won the right to remain on their land at a southern African tribunal. But Mugabe has declared the ruling null and void and pulled out of the tribunal. Farmers cannot contest land issues in Zimbabwe and approaching international courts has thus far not worked either. When CNN interviewed Mugabe's minister of state, Didymas Mutasa, about the disregard for human and property rights on the farms, he blamed the farmers for the violence, saying landless blacks are getting frustrated with their refusal to relinquish their land. ""Human rights are beginning to be seen now because they benefit the whites, and when they were affecting blacks badly as they did the likes of us, it didn't matter and nobody raised anything about those human rights. ""And sometimes we say, good heavens, if that is the kind of human rights you are talking about, you better keep them away from us; we don't want to see them,"" he told CNN. But it is black farm workers who are caught in the cross fire. They continue to bear the brunt of the land reform program by repeatedly being beaten and intimidated. Some have even been killed. Tractor driver William Kale said it is farm laborers working for white farmers who are targeted. ""They actually say you the workers, you are ones that are supporting the white farmer. That is why he is carrying on farming and we refuse to go because we have nowhere to go,"" Kale told CNN. Many farmers and farm workers we spoke to say they are in a worse position now under the unity government than they were before. Lock said: ""When ZANU-PF was in power, you had hawks and doves in government and the doves were approachable and often helped us. But now that these positions are being shared with Mr. Tsvangirai's MDC, Mr. Mugabe has only appointed hawks to his cabinet who insist on continuing the land reform program. And when it comes to the MDC, the land issue seems to be a hot potato they do not want to touch. I have asked Mr. Tsvangirai to intervene but nothing is happening."" Prime Minister Tsvangirai refuted that. ""That is not true,"" he said. ""We initiated to find out who is being affected, the few remaining white farmers. Let's be frank here, we are talking of farmers as being white, but to me any destruction of farm production affects the whole viability of agriculture. There should be no disruption of any farm activity."" To those under siege these words are little comfort as they continue to fight a battle they are unlikely to win.","Zimbabwe white farmers battle continuing policy of land redistribution .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A backlog in processing education benefits has forced the Department of Veterans Affairs to authorize millions of dollars in emergency funds for veterans who need the cash to pay for school. The Veterans Affairs department will give up to $3,000 to students who haven't received funds from education bills . The department announced Friday that it will issue up to $3,000 to students who have yet to receive the funds that the VA's various education bills -- including the recently passed Post-9/11 GI Bill -- provide to help veterans pay for college. ""This is an extraordinary action we're taking,"" VA Secretary Eric Shinseki said in a statement. ""But it's necessary because we recognize the hardships some of our Veterans face."" The VA estimates there are 75,000 veterans eligible for the emergency funds, including 25,000 veterans who have served since September 11. VA statistics show more than 27,500 vets have already received benefits for housing or books under the new Post-9/11 GI Bill, and hundreds of thousands more have gotten benefits under its other programs. The delay in processing the benefits has created much consternation among veterans, with some worried they would have to drop out of school because of a lack of funds. The lag was caused because some schools have not yet filed for the tuition and because of a backlog at the Veterans Affairs offices, according to a department official. Any money given to eligible veterans will be deducted from the education benefits they are scheduled to receive and can be used for housing and books. The VA has been speaking to schools to ensure that veterans do not get kicked out if their tuition has not yet been paid, said VA spokeswoman Katie Roberts. ""Veterans were having a lot of financial issues, and we needed to address them,"" she said. To help with the influx of applications, the department has hired more than 700 extra processors. Veterans groups said the emergency funds were much needed. ""AMVETS is very happy with the swift action taken by the secretary. We suggested a similar solution earlier this month so we are happy to see they're listening,"" said Ryan Galluci, a spokesman for AMVETS, a veterans' service organization.","Backlog in tuition payments forces VA to authorize millions in emergency funds .

"(CNN) -- Intensifying violence, food shortages and widespread drought are driving an increasing number of Somalis to seek asylum in Yemen, the United Nations' refugee agency said Tuesday. A man brandishes a knife while others carry old notes during a demonstration against record-high inflation. More than 15,000 refugees have arrived in the Yemeni port city of Aden since January, compared with 7,166 people in the first four months of 2007, according to a spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Many of those seeking asylum brave treacherous boat trips across the Gulf of Aden. Consequently, the number of boats landing in Aden has jumped from 60 to 361 since January while the number of fatalities has remained constant, according to UNHCR. The agency attributed the surge to strife in Somalia, where riots continued in the capital city of Mogadishu for the second day Tuesday. According to news reports, Somali soldiers killed at least two people Monday during the protests over rising food prices.  Watch protesters take to the streets » . Somali refugees pay as much as $150 to cross the Gulf of Aden in search of asylum. Because of its proximity to the war-torn country, Yemen is a common destination for Somalis fleeing economic hardship, famine and war. Yemen is also an attractive location because Somalis receive automatic refugee status in the fellow Muslim country. New smuggling routes across the Red Sea have also led to increased numbers of refugees in Yemen, according to the UNHCR. Refugees often die before reaching Yemen because of dangerous sea conditions and overcrowded vessels. Others die at the hands of their smugglers, who order the passengers to jump overboard when the Yemeni coast guard approaches the vessel. Yemen's coast guard stepped up patrols of its coastline this year in an attempt to deter smugglers, according to the UNHCR, which operates shelters and reception centers for refugees in Yemen. The coast guard has also seized boats and given them Somali fishermen affected by the 2004 tsunami.","Agency attributes surging number of refugees in Yemen to unrest in Somalia .

"Washington (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama met Monday night with his national security team on Afghanistan and Pakistan, the White House announced. It was the ninth meeting of the president's war council to consider whether to send more troops to Afghanistan, as requested by the U.S. commander on the ground there. The White House made no statement after the meeting ended at 10 p.m. ET (0300 GMT). The meeting included Vice President Joe Biden, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen, Afghanistan commanding Gen. Stanley McChrystal, U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Karl Eikenberry and other senior officials, the White House said earlier. At the last war council meeting -- on November 11, Veteran's Day -- Obama pushed for revisions in proposed plans for troop increases to clarify how and when U.S. troops would turn over responsibility to the Afghan government. Obama would seek answers to the questions he posed on November 11 about ""not just how we get people there, but what's the strategy for getting them out,"" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said before the meeting. No matter what happened at the meeting, Gibbs said, Obama will not announce a decision on troop deployment until at least next week. One option calls for sending about 34,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan in addition to the 68,000 already committed to the country, with other options involving variations of that plan, sources told CNN. Before the November 11 meeting, Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander in the Middle East, told CNN that the decision-making process was approaching completion. Petraeus emphasized the need to focus on the mission of ensuring that Afghanistan ""does not once again become a sanctuary or safe haven for al Qaeda and the kind of transnational extremists that carried out the 9/11 attacks."" The Obama administration has expressed concerns about Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai's viability and has ratcheted up pressure to end corruption in order to combat an intensifying Taliban insurgency. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, on a trip to Afghanistan last week to attend Karzai's inauguration after his recent re-election, reiterated the U.S. concerns in a dinner meeting with Karzai and encouraged him to seize the ""clear window of opportunity"" before him at a ""critical moment"" in Afghanistan's history. The United States and other countries are increasing their civilian presence in Afghanistan to bolster efforts to stabilize the country, the the U.S. special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, told reporters on Monday. Asked about the corruption problem, Holbrooke noted that some Afghan government ministers have ""extraordinary records"" of accomplishment. The United States will work with those ministers, while recognizing that years of civil war and social woes have weakened overall leadership capabilities in Afghanistan, he said. ""This is one of the main reasons we're increasing our civilian role,"" Holbrooke said. ""And it's extremely delicate to get the mix right. We want to help the Afghans help themselves. We do not want to replace a sovereign government with internationals."" Republican opponents are pushing Obama to quickly agree to McChrystal's reported request for up to 40,000 additional troops in Afghanistan as part of a counterinsurgency strategy. ""This won't be perfect or easy, but it will allow America's fighting men and women to leave Afghanistan with honor, and it will enable Afghans to build a better, more peaceful future,"" said a letter to Obama from 10 Republican senators sent on Veteran's Day.","NEW: White House makes no statement after meeting ended .

"(CNN)  -- Brazilian authorities on Thursday ruled the death of former world boxing champion Arturo Gatti a suicide, according to local media reports. Arturo Gatti was found dead on July 11 in a rented condo in Brazil, where his family was vacationing. Gatti's death initially had been investigated as a murder. The boxer's widow, Amanda Carina Barbosa Rodrigues, who had been arrested as a suspect, was released from jail Thursday, the newspaper O Diario de Pernambuco reported. Her lawyer, Celio Avelino, argued that it ""would have been impossible for her to suspend and hang a man of that size"". Gatti was found dead on July 11 in a rented condo in Brazil, where he was taking a vacation with Rodrigues and their young child. Police found strangulation marks on Gatti's neck and a blood-stained purse strap at the scene. The public safety ministry of the northeastern Pernambuco state said investigators determined that Gatti hanged himself in a stairwell, the newspaper O Globo reported. Police official Paulo Alberes said Gatti used the purse strap to end his life, O Diario de Pernambuco reported. The 37-year-old Canadian, who was born in Italy and made his name as a fighter based in New Jersey, was staying in the northeast seaside resort of Porto de Galihnas. Gatti made his reputation in his renowned trilogy of fights against ""Irish"" Micky Ward, losing the first but triumphing in the other two. He was a former International Boxing Federation (IBF) super-featherweight champion and World Boxing Council (WBC) light-welterweight champ. Gatti retired in 2007 after suffering a knockout defeat by Alfonso Gomez, ending with a record of 40 wins and nine losses, 31 by knockout. He grew up in Montreal, Canada, after leaving Italy at an early age, and returned to the city after his retirement. Gatti's suicide came less than two weeks after another world champion boxer took his own life. On July 1, three-time world boxing champion Alexis Arguello, who was the mayor of the Nicaraguan capital of Managua, was found dead in his home from a gunshot wound to the chest. He was 57. A third boxer, former welterweight champion Vernon Forrest, died last week after being shot multiple times in a neighborhood southwest of downtown Atlanta, Georgia.","Gatti's death initially investigated as a murder .

Norway did not explain how it had learned of the alleged confiscation, and there was no immediate reaction from Iran. Norway's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a written statement that it ""has reacted strongly"" and summoned the Iranian charge d'affaires on Wednesday afternoon to protest the move. During the meeting with the Iranian charge d'affaires, State Secretary Gry Larsen also expressed ""grave concern"" about how Ebadi's husband has allegedly been treated. ""Earlier this autumn, he [Ebadi's husband] was arrested in Tehran and severely beaten. His pension has been stopped and his bank account has been frozen,"" the statement from Norway said. Store said in the statement that it marked the ""first time a Nobel Peace Prize has been confiscated by national authorities.""

Starting in 1969, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel also has been awarded. While the other prizes are awarded by committees based in Sweden, the peace prize is determined by a five-member panel appointed by the Norwegian parliament. Ebadi received the prize for her focus on human rights, especially on the struggle to improve the status of women and children.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Kevin Garibo hasn't known life outside a hospital. Born three months ago with respiratory issues, he needed a procedure to breathe on his own. Nurses prod at him, medical machines hum around him and tubes are more present than teddy bears. But in the arms of Chris Haack, who strokes his cheek and speaks in a soft whisper while rocking him in a chair, little Kevin is one blissed-out baby. Haack, a retired nurse from Roswell, Georgia, is a trained volunteer with ""Baby Buddies,"" a program in the neonatal intensive care unit at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston. As nurses race around administering medical care, she can comfort the tiny patients and stand in for parents who can't be there all the time to give the positive attention -- not the attention associated with pain or discomfort -- that is key to a baby's development and integral in forming trust. ""They need to be touched, they need to be loved, and that face -- that's why I do it,"" Haack says, peering down with a smile at Kevin, whose eyes are locked on hers. ""I get more out of it than I probably give."" Studies show that giving, which extends beyond packages wrapped in ribbons, does a person good. In this holiday season, CNN introduces with this story a special series we're calling ""Giving in Focus: The 12 Days of Goodness,"" in which we'll highlight acts of kindness and generosity that we hope will inspire. Has someone done a good deed for you? Share your story . One person who can attest to the power of giving is Cami Walker, a 36-year-old woman who received a prescription to give when her multiple sclerosis, a diagnosis she got at age 33, left her a physical and emotional wreck. She could barely get out of bed, and yet Mbali Creazzo, a friend and spiritual mentor, single-handedly killed Walker's pity party. She said, ""'Cami, you really need to stop thinking about yourself. ... You're feeding this disease,'"" Walker remembers. ""She said, 'I have a prescription for you. Give away 29 gifts in 29 days.' "" Creazzo, a South African born medicine woman who lives in Oakland, California, explained that the idea, rooted in indigenous practices, was taught to her, although the number of days prescribed may have been different. ""Altruism has been going on for thousands of years,"" said Creazzo, 58. ""Why it's so powerful at this moment is because of what's happening in the world today. People are looking for that place inside of them where they are of some use."" Walker, who lives in Hollywood, California, dismissed Creazzo's suggestion at first but came back to it when she realized she had nothing to lose by trying. What followed made her a convert to the idea. Whether she simply called a friend to offer support or bought iced-tea for a homeless guy on a hot day, the simple actions made a difference. She said her mood lifted, her ability to get around improved and the progression of the disease stopped. ""I don't see it as a cure. I still have MS,"" said Walker, who went on to write the best-seller ""29 Gifts: How a Month of Giving Can Change Your Life"" and create an online community at 29gifts.org, where Creazzo is also involved. ""I really don't think about the limitations of my disease. I wake up more focused on what I'm capable of."" A long list of scientific and widely accepted studies point to the benefits a giver gets, said Stephen Post, author of ""Why Good Things Happen to Good People: How to Live a Longer, Healthier, Happier Life by the Simple Act of Giving."" One study looked at preteens who'd first been surveyed in the 1920s in Berkeley, California. Those who displayed generosity and a giving attitude grew up to have lower rates of heart disease and depression, said Post, a professor of preventive medicine and director of the Center for Medical Humanities, Compassionate Care, and Bioethics at Stony Brook University in New York. A study done at Harvard showed the strength of immune systems grew among students who watched a film about Mother Theresa, he said, and stayed high among those who were asked to continue thinking about giving. MRI devices have illustrated that the part of the brain that releases ""feel-good chemicals,"" he said, lights up when giving's on the mind. Post, who's also the president of The Institute for Research on Unlimited Love, said hormone levels tied to serenity, trust and compassion rise when people exhibit generous behaviors. Those same feelings, he added, have long been known to help wounds heal more quickly. Another study, one he's involved with now, has shown that people who go through Alcoholics Anonymous and then help other alcoholics have a 40 percent rate of recovery, while those who don't help other alcoholics recover at a rate of 22 percent, he said. ""Kitchen table wisdom says it's good to be good,"" and giving is ""part of every moral and spiritual tradition,"" said Post, whose own mother used to tell him to ""go out and do something for someone"" whenever he got pouty. ""It turned out there actually is pretty good science about this."" For Azim Jamal, a motivational speaker and co-author of the best-seller ""The Power of Giving: How Giving Back Enriches Us All,"" the excitement about this topic is rooted in the possibilities of what might be -- the ripple effect. If everyone gave time, money, talents or passion, what could that mean for individuals, communities, even the world? ""The power of giving is instantaneous, continuous and eternal,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Leading figures from Poland to the United States have been paying tribute to Marek Edelman, the anti-Nazi resistance fighter and Solidarity movement supporter who died Friday. Marek Edelman was one of the leaders of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in World War II. Edelman was one of the leaders of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, ""the largest, symbolically most important Jewish uprising"" against the Nazis during World War II, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Polish President Lech Kaczynski and Prime Minister Donald Tusk both issued statements mourning Edelman. Tusk called him an ""exceptional man,"" saying ""his bravery was a testament to the courage of the fighters of the Jewish Fighting Organization,"" as the largest Jewish resistance movement in the ghetto was known. The prime minister also praised him for standing up against the Polish Communist government's anti-Semitic campaign of 1968, and hailed him as an example for free, democratic Poland. The U.S. State Department saluted ""his life dedicated to the defense of human dignity and freedom. The United States stands with Poland as it mourns the loss of a great man."" Edelman is thought to have been the last surviving commander of the uprising, in which Jews fought Nazi efforts to send them to concentration camps. Armed with pistols, some rifles and automatic weapons, and hand-made grenades, the resistance fighters attacked the Germans and their allies when they tried to liquidate the Warsaw Ghetto in April 1943. The Nazis had planned to round up all the ghetto's Jews in three days, but in the end it took them more than a month -- longer than some countries held out against Hitler's armies. The Nazis reduced the ghetto to rubble in the process of flushing resistance fighters out of their bunkers. Edelman was in one of the last groups to hold out in the headquarters of the Jewish Fighting Organization at 18 Mila Street. In the final days of the uprising he was able to sneak out of the ghetto by way of the city's sewers, he wrote after the war. He went on to fight in the Warsaw Polish Uprising, a two-month battle against the Nazis in 1944, undertaken primarily by non-Jewish Poles. After the war, Edelman became a cardiologist. In the late 1940s, he published a short history of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in Polish, Yiddish, and English, called ""The Ghetto Fights."" In it, he described the creation of the ghetto by the Nazis. ""In November 1940, the Germans finally established the Warsaw Ghetto. The Jewish population still living outside the 'Seuchensperrgebiet' ('Quarantined Zone') was brought inside the special area. Poles living within the designated ghetto boundaries were ordered to move out,"" he wrote. ""Beginning with November 15, no Jew was allowed to leave the Jewish precincts. All houses vacated by Jews were immediately locked by the Germans and then, with all their contents, gratuitously given to Polish merchants and hucksters ... . The walls and barbed wire surrounding the ghetto grew higher every day until, on November 15, they completely cut off the Jews from the outside world."" Hunger and disease were rife in the ghetto, he wrote. ""People began to die of hunger in the streets. Every morning, about 4-5 a.m., funeral carts collected a dozen or more corpses on the streets that had been covered with a sheet of paper and weighted down with a few rocks. Some simply fell in the streets and remained there,"" Edelman remembered. Jews organized a local government and Socialist unions, but conditions became progressively worse in the ghetto, with the Nazis summarily executing people. Nazis then began deporting Jews to concentration camps -- sometimes with the help of Jewish collaborators in the ghetto -- Edelman wrote. By that time, many in the ghetto knew the Nazis were systematically murdering Jews in the camps, he recalled. He describes in detail the spring 1943 uprising, a street-by-street battle that ended with the ghetto in ruins. Edelman's history finishes simply, listing the handful of survivors of the hundreds who fought back. ""Those who had gone over to the 'Aryan side' continued the partisan fight in the woods. The majority perished eventually. The small group that was still alive at the time took an active part in the 1944 Warsaw Uprising as the 'ZOB Group.' At present the following of our comrades are still among the living: Chajka Betchatowska, B. Szpigel, Chana Krysztal, Masza Glejtman, and Marek Edelman."" During the early 1980s Edelman was active with Solidarity, the Polish trade union movement that opposed the Communist government. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner awarded him the Legion of Honor in 2008, on a visit to Poland marking the 65th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Edelman was born in 1921, according to Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust museum. He was buried in Warsaw's Jewish cemetery on Friday, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported .","Marek Edelman was one of the leaders of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising .

"(CNN) -- Sonia, a single mother with HIV in Brazil, travels four hours to reach a government-run health facility that provides her with free drug treatment. Brazil's response to the HIV/AIDS fight has been widely praised and adopted as a model around the world. The journey is long, she told CNN, but it's a small price to pay for the government-provided drugs that have helped keep her out of the hospital for the past 11 years. Sonia is just one of the many Brazilians who have benefited from the country's novel approach to fighting the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Brazil jolted the global health community in 1996 when it began guaranteeing free anti-retroviral treatment to HIV/AIDS patients. For Sonia, government-funded treatment comes in the form of 20 pills. Taken daily, the anti-retroviral medicine has helped keep her HIV at bay. Coupled with government-supported prevention efforts and aggressive public awareness campaigns, the so-called Brazilian response has been hailed as a model for developing countries. Watch a report on Brazil's pioneering response to HIV/AIDS » . Prevention campaigns, which often take the forms of candid public awareness ads with slogans like ""Be good in bed, use a condom,"" have resulted in widespread knowledge of HIV. According to a recent study conducted by the country's Ministry of Health, Brazil boasts one of the highest rates of knowledge globally when it comes to HIV avoidance and transmittal. Brazil was ""the first country to realize there is no separation between prevention and treatment,"" Mauro Schechter, professor of infectious diseases at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, told CNN. Schechter, who has studied the HIV/AIDS epidemic since 1989, said it took the rest of the global health community some 15 years to realize that the two go hand-in-hand. Other countries that have adopted the Brazilian model » . The comprehensive response has extended the lives of tens of thousands of Brazilians and saved the government billions, researchers estimate. A recent study published by researchers from Brown University and the Harvard School of Public Health said that Brazil has saved $1 billion alone by producing its own generic versions of HIV/AIDS medicines and negotiating discounts for imported drugs. Those drug savings come on top of the estimated $2 billion the program has saved Brazil in hospital costs between 1996 and 2004. Brazil's efforts to reverse the tide of the AIDS epidemic have become the object of admiration in the global health community, but the trailblazer is encountering new challenges. When Brazil decided to guarantee free anti-retrovirals, there were 10,000 people being treated and it was organized as a program to treat a small amount of people for a limited amount of time, according to Schechter. Patients are living longer and oftentimes able to get their disease under control, thanks to combination therapies, better known as drug cocktails. But that means they also require drug treatment for a longer period of time. Furthermore, as HIV has evolved from an acute illness into a chronic disease, patients have also become vulnerable to other health risks and medical conditions. Valdileia Veloso is the director of the Institute of Clinical Research at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, a public health research institution in Rio de Janeiro. She told CNN patients are presenting with complications of chronic HIV and AIDS, which requires new treatment. ""It's a new challenge for us,"" she said. Heart disease is one of the big problems that doctors are encountering. While there's a system in place to prevent people from dying from HIV, preventable causes like heart conditions are causing deaths. ""These people are dying from preventable causes,"" Schechter told CNN. While Brazil has shown that providing universal access to treatment can be achieved, it needs to modify its approach to treat the evolving disease, he said. ""If the epidemic changes face, you need to adapt.""","Brazil has been hailed as a leader in the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic .

"London, England (CNN) -- A long-awaited inquiry into Britain's role in the Iraq war got under way Tuesday -- a process that could determine whether former Prime Minister Tony Blair misled his country over the 2003 invasion. The inquiry is expected to be the most thorough investigation yet into the decisions that led up to the war and governed Britain's involvement, analysts said. It is not a court of law, so the inquiry cannot find anyone criminally responsible or even apportion blame. But inquiry members will be able to judge the legality of the conflict. ""The Iraq Inquiry was set up to identify the lessons that should be learned from the UK's involvement in Iraq, to help future governments who may face similar situations,"" inquiry Chairman John Chilcot said at the opening of the hearings Tuesday. ""To do this, we need to establish what happened."" Chilcot, a senior civil servant, said on the eve of the hearings that the committee is ""completely determined"" to write the full story of Iraq war decision-making by the British government using all the evidence it can get. Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who announced the inquiry in June, has promised the committee will have access to the full range of information, including secret documents, in order to identify lessons that can be learned from the war. The inquiry officially began July 30, but Tuesday was the first day of hearings, which are expected to last into the new year. The hearings were initially going to be held behind closed doors, but after criticism the government decided to allow the hearings to be public and televised. The committee has said it will decide on a case-by-case basis whether to keep the hearings private when discussing sensitive or classified information. Blair will be called to testify, Chilcot said earlier this year, and the former prime minister has said he will appear. Other witnesses will be key decision-makers involved in Iraq, Chilcot has said. Chilcot has said the panel members plan to visit Iraq as part of their work, as well as hold discussions with Iraqis outside of the country. Top officials from the British and U.S. governments also might be called on for evidence, he said. Britain has already held four hearings about the Iraq war. But because all were held before the end of 2004 -- so close to the start of the war -- they were hampered by limited information, political analyst Glen Rangwala of Cambridge University told CNN. ""They didn't manage to achieve anything like a comprehensive understanding of the paths that led the UK to support the United States in the invasion,"" he said. ""This will be the first to look at political decision-making that led to the British invasion of 2003, with the potential to tell a full story."" People involved in those decisions are more likely to testify now than they were a few years ago, Rangwala said. That partly because British troops are no longer involved in combat in Iraq, but also because the war there is no longer the politicized issue it was when Blair was in power, he said. ""The sort of political sting has been taken out of it, and people who are presenting their evidence to the (inquiry) won't feel quite so constrained by the political line, or the party line, than they would have a few years ago,"" he said. Britain's first two inquiries were held by government committees in 2003. The House of Commons Select Committee on Foreign Affairs examined whether Britain's Foreign Office gave accurate and complete information to Parliament in the run-up to the war. It found the government exerted no improper influence on the drafting of the dossier given to Parliament on Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction. The Intelligence and Security Committee then examined whether intelligence about Iraq and its weapons was properly assessed and accurately reflected in government publications. Its findings were mixed. The next two inquiries had narrow mandates, looking at specific aspects of the war. The Hutton report from January 2004 investigated the death of David Kelly, a leading microbiologist and former U.N. weapons inspector who committed suicide months earlier. Kelly had worked for the British Ministry of Defence, advising it on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, but was later found to be the source of a BBC report that said the government had exaggerated evidence to justify war on Iraq. Following that came the Butler inquiry, which looked at the accuracy of intelligence on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and elsewhere. It found some of the intelligence sources were ""seriously flawed,"" but that there was no evidence of deliberate distortion or culpable negligence by spy agencies.","Hearings begin in UK Iraq Inquiry to determine legality of the Iraq War .

"(CNN) -- Billy Ray Cyrus may be a country boy at heart, but he is also pretty savvy when it comes to navigating Hollywood. Billy Ray Cyrus has a full plate with acting, touring, composing and being a dad. When others wrote him off as a novelty act after the 1992 hit ""Achy Breaky Heart,"" Cyrus kept making music and eventually turned to acting. It was a decision he said came after some well-timed fatherly advice. ""In the mid-'90s, my dad said to me 'Son, you've got all of your eggs in one basket and you are living and dying by music,' "" Cyrus recalled. ""He said 'I want you to have a career like Kenny Rogers.' "" Cyrus said his dad suggested he branch out into acting. Cyrus eventually auditioned for and won a role in what appeared to be an unlikely vehicle -- David Lynch's 2001 film ""Mulholland Drive."" After Lynch, known for such works as ""Blue Velvet"" and ""Twin Peaks,"" suggested that Cyrus should continue to pursue the craft, he went on to star in the television drama ""Doc,"" which also helped spur the career of Cyrus' greatest production -- ""Hannah Montana"" star, and Cyrus' daughter, Miley Cyrus. Now, with the release of ""Hannah Montana: The Movie"" on Blu-ray and DVD, a music tour and an upcoming role in a film featuring comedian George Lopez and martial arts expert Jackie Chan, Cyrus is staying busy. He recently took some time out of his hectic schedule to talk to CNN about how he keeps it all together, how he manages raising a family full of performers (son Trace is a member of the band Metro Station, daughter Brandi performs with the band Frank and Derol and also acts, as do younger children Braison and Noah) and what makes him a good fit for Hollywood. CNN: What do you like about ""Hannah Montana: The Movie?"" Billy Ray Cyrus: I think it's got a certain amount of realism to it with art imitating life imitating art. It certainly parallels a lot of things in mine and Miley's real world and real lives. I wrote the song ""Back to Tennessee"" and as I read the script for the movie, ""Back to Tennessee"" became a cornerstone of the film and the title track off the album. The realism of the film translates into the music, and I think vice versa. CNN: The film speaks to never losing touch with your roots. How important is that to you? Cyrus: Extremely. My dad told me as a kid to always be aware of where you are, always have a vision for your future, but never forget where you came from. CNN: You've had careers in both music and acting. Do you still feel a bit like a fish out of water dealing with Hollywood? Cyrus: I love Hollywood as far as being an actor. Getting to work with Jackie Chan and George Lopez in this new film we have coming out in January [""The Spy Next Door""], working with Heather Locklear and Patricia Neal in the Lifetime movie ""Flying By"" and Brooke Shields, who has appeared as my deceased wife on ""Hannah Montana."" I look back at it now and think that I may fit in more to the film community than I do Nashville, to tell you the truth. I love what I do. CNN: Do you have a preference, then, for acting over music? Cyrus: My preference is to find projects that can combine the two. I also love to write scores. I wrote a lot of the scores for ""Doc"" and I love to write scores for other projects. CNN: How do you balance being a star with being a dad? Cyrus: The very best I can. I just take it one step at a time and do the best I can. My dad was to me what I try to be to Miley, which is somewhat of a best friend. I try my best to be a good daddy and if she wants to talk about business or music I try my best to be a good manager. I try to be all of those things because that's what my dad was to me. Unfortunately, my dad passed away four years ago from mesothelioma, but I feel like in some ways my dad is looking down on me and smiling. His name was Ronald Ray Cyrus and a lot of people say Miley changed her name to Miley Ray because of Billy Ray, but that's not true. She did that in honor of my dad, because the two of them just loved each other to pieces. CNN: So will Miley ever remake ""Achy Breaky Heart""? Cyrus: I doubt it, but anything is a possibility. In 1991 I recorded ""Achy Breaky Heart"" and we are not too terribly far away from the 20-year anniversary, and there are some major stars who want to re-do that song. I'm flirting with the idea. There's one cat in particular that if I told you who it was, it would blow your mind. But I've got to keep it under my hat right now.","Billy Ray Cyrus has worked steadily since 1992's ""Achy Breaky Heart""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A former U.S. government scientist who served in sensitive positions on classified aerospace projects was willing to sell ""some of our most guarded secrets"" a prosecutor alleged Tuesday. Stewart David Nozette of Chevy Chase, Maryland, was taken into custody Monday by FBI agents. Stewart David Nozette, 52, who is charged with attempted espionage, appeared in U.S. District Court Tuesday afternoon. Authorities said in a criminal complaint that Nozette, of Chevy Chase, Maryland, tried to deliver classified information to someone he thought was an Israeli intelligence official, but who was actually an FBI undercover agent. Assistant U.S. Attorney Anthony Asuncion said Tuesday that evidence will show Nozette disclosed to investigators information that was ""top secret, related to our national defense, that would cause exceptionally grave damage to national security"" if revealed to a foreign country. He said the FBI made videotapes of Nozette indicating he was ""willing to sell some of our most guarded secrets."" The prosecutor noted that the charges carry a possible life sentence. Nozette answered in the affirmative when Magistrate Judge Deborah Robinson asked him whether he understood the seriousness of the charges against him. Other than that, Nozette, who was arrested Monday, made no statements at his initial court appearance. Defense attorney John Kiyonaga did not immediately oppose the government's request to hold his client without bond, and said his client agreed to waive a deadline for a formal detention hearing. Nozette, who remains in custody, will appear in court again on October 29 for detention and preliminary hearings. In an affidavit, the FBI sets out the case against Nozette, who received a doctorate in planetary sciences from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The FBI document, signed by Special Agent Leslie G. Martell, says that Nozette in January 2009 told a colleague ""that if the United States government tried to put him in jail"" on an unrelated matter, Nozette would move to Israel or another unidentified foreign country and ""tell them everything"" he knows. Nozette had a ""top secret"" clearance, and served at the White House on the National Space Council for President George H.W. Bush, the affidavit says. Later, from early 2000 to early 2006, he did research and development for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Naval Research Laboratory, and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, it says. The document says Nozette also acted as a technical consultant from 1998 until early 2008 ""for an aerospace company that was wholly owned by the government of the state of Israel."" The company consulted with Nozette monthly, getting answers to questions, and he received total payments of $225,000, Martell's affidavit says. In early September, Nozette was contacted by phone by an individual purporting to be an Israeli intelligence officer, but who really was an FBI undercover agent, the document says. They met in downtown Washington in front of a hotel, and over lunch, Nozette ""demonstrated his willingness to work for Israeli intelligence,"" it says. The undercover agent engaged in a series of meetings with Nozette, and eventually Nozette allegedly provided ""secret"" information in a ""dead drop"" post office box. Some of the information, the affidavit says, was classified as secret. The criminal complaint does not accuse the government of Israel of any violations of U.S. law.","Sewart David Nozette, 52, appeared in U.S. District Court on Tuesday .

"NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (CNN)  -- A quiet rendition of ""Amazing Grace"" capped an emotional candlelight vigil Monday night for slain Yale University student Annie Le, whose body was found on what was to have been her wedding day. Students at Yale attend a candlelight vigil for Annie Le Monday night. Several hundred people turned out on the Yale campus for the vigil, crying and hugging each other. Le's roommate, Natalie Powers, said the 24-year-old graduate student in pharmacology ""was as good a human being as you'd ever hope to meet."" ""She was also really tenacious and had a sense of humor that was never far away, and she was tougher than you'd think by just looking at her,"" Powers said. ""That this horrible tragedy happened at all is incomprehensible. But that it happened to her I think is infinitely more so. It seems completely senseless."" Connecticut state medical examiners announced Monday that the body found in a Yale medical research building over the weekend was that of Le, who had been missing for nearly a week. Her body was found Sunday hidden in a basement wall. Bloody clothes were found hidden above tiles in a drop ceiling elsewhere in the same building, investigators said. Le was last seen entering the building Tuesday morning. Thomas Kaplan, editor-in-chief of the Yale Daily News, said Le ""really had everything going for her."" ""She was a top scholar. She was very outgoing, a warm person,"" Kaplan said. ""You know, she was diminutive in stature, but certainly not in personality. And that's what I think just makes this so sad for everyone, regardless of whether you knew her. It's just a tragedy."" Le's death is being investigated as a homicide, but Connecticut medical examiners released no further information beyond the identification. A candlelight vigil in her honor was scheduled for Monday evening on the campus. A Yale professor said on Monday that the building has good security and only certain people can enter, let alone access certain areas. Professor Gary Rudnick, who interviewed Le when she applied for admission to the graduate program in pharmacology, said it gives him the sense that there could be a ""murderer among us."" No suspects are in custody, but investigators are questioning several people in the case, New Haven Police spokesman Joe Avery said.  Watch a report about the case » . Kaplan said Le's killing has left Yale students shocked and wary. ""Only Yalies had access to that basement, and that seems to point to someone in our community being involved in this,"" Kaplan said. ""That's what is so frightening."" Authorities have not described the clothes that were found, nor said to whom they may have belonged. Teams of investigators at a Connecticut State Police lab worked through the weekend processing and examining the blood-stained clothes. Kaplan said a Yale police official told the newspaper the clothes were not what Le was wearing when she entered the building. At a meeting Monday for members of the campus community, Yale officials discussed security and provided an update on the investigation. A faculty member and a student who attended the meeting told CNN that Yale officials said police have narrowed down suspects. Security cameras captured video of Le as she entered the four-story lab building at 10 Amistad Street, about 10 blocks from the main campus, six days ago. After poring over hours of surveillance tapes, authorities said they had not found images of her leaving the building. Rudnick described security in the building as ""very good."" It had restricted access, and simply having a Yale ID card was not enough to get in, he said. Within the building, one had to have special access to enter certain areas, he said. Le was to be married Sunday on New York's Long Island to Jonathan Widawsky, a graduate student at Columbia University. ""Annie has been planning this wedding for over a year with John, and she was very excited. She's been doing a countdown to her wedding day,"" Jennifer Simpson, a friend in Sacramento, told the CBS ""Early"" show. ""She was doing weather patterns to make sure that the weather would be perfect on her wedding day. She just wanted everything to be perfect, everything down to table napkins, to flowers. Annie was very, very excited about this day."" Investigators searched a waste facility Sunday that normally handles garbage from the Yale lab, said William Reiner of the FBI's New Haven office. The search took place at the Resources Recovery Authority landfill in Hartford, near New Haven. ""In a situation like this, it's common for us to follow the trash,"" Reiner said. Yale University President Richard Levin, in a statement to the campus community, said, ""Our hearts go out to Annie Le's family, fiancé and friends."" The school sent out information Monday from Vice President and Secretary Linda Lorimer saying, ""We are cooperating in all possible ways with the police to ensure they find every shred of physical evidence in the building so they can solve this horrible crime without delay. When the building does reopen, there will be extra security both inside and outside the facility for the foreseeable future."" Lorimer added, ""To augment the substantial security already in place at the Medical School, Yale moved last week to increase security and police patrols on the streets in the area and to add a new bicycle patrol. Yale also added security personnel inside Sterling Hall of Medicine, where Annie Le had her lab."" The school has made grief counselors available, as well as a 24-hour help line number. ""The university chaplain's office is available to offer pastoral counseling and can put members of the community in contact with those of many faiths and denominations,"" the message from Lorimer said. Le, a resident of Placerville, California, seemed to have been well aware of the risks of crime in a university town. In February, she compared crime and safety at Yale to other Ivy League schools for a piece for B magazine, published by the medical school. Among the tips she offered: Keep a minimum amount on your person. And she practiced what she preached, Simpson told the ""Early"" show. ""Annie always made sure she was safe,"" Simpson said. ""She doesn't walk around at night by herself. If she had to work late, she would make sure someone could come pick her up or walk with her."" When she walked over to the research building on Tuesday, she left her purse, credit cards and cell phone in her office. Vanessa Flores, Le's former roommate, wondered whether the magazine article had something to do with Le's death. ""The only thing I can possibly think of right now is maybe a psychopath, an antisocial person who -- I don't know -- maybe got upset about what she wrote about back in February about not being safe, and just kind of wanted to prove her wrong."" Le, originally from California, graduated from Union Mine High School in 2003, where she was named ""Best of the Best,"" and ""Most Likely To Be The Next Einstein."" ""She was very smart, well-rounded, liked by peers and very involved in school,""  high school principal Tony DeVille told CNN affiliate WFSB. Le set the bar high for herself, writing in her profile for the National Institutes of Health that she was interested in studying and researching regenerative medicine and hoped to remain working at at NIH or become a professor. Her friends remembered her as one of the nicest people they had ever met. Laurel Griffeath, a high school friend, told NBC's ""Today"" show in Le had a beaming personality matched with impressive intelligence, a girl who ""had it all."" ""Annie was just an amazing person, and I know that when tragedies happen, people always say that, but she truly was,"" Griffeath told the ""Today"" show. ""She was probably the most brilliant person I've ever met in my life, but what made her more amazing was that there was an intersection of intelligence and personality and ability and she worked hard and she was great with people and she cared about people and she was funny and she didn't sacrifice one part of her life for another like a lot of people kind of seem to. ""She just really kind of had it all. She was really amazing.""

"(CNN) -- A Saudi court that sentenced a journalist to 60 lashes for her work on a controversial television show has summoned a second woman affiliated with the TV station. The Saudi information ministry said Sunday that a Jeddah court has asked the second journalist to appear because of her work as a coordinator with the Lebanese Broadcasting Corp. The woman was set to appear on Monday, but the hearing has been postponed because she is ill, said a ministry official, who could not be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. The show in question, ""A Thick Red Line,"" explores social taboos. In one episode, a Saudi man, Mazen Abdul Jawad, bragged about his sex life. Saudi authorities put him on trial and sentenced him to five years in prison and 1,000 lashes. Soon afterward, the court sentenced journalist Rosanna Al-Yami who worked as a coordinator and guest-booker for the show. In addition to the 60 lashes, Al-Yami is banned for two years from traveling outside Saudi Arabia. While the charges against her include involvement in preparing the program, she was not involved in setting up the episode in which Abdul Jawad appeared, said his lawyer Suleiman Al-Jumeii. Al-Jumeii said that Al-Yami has opted not to appeal the court's verdict. Al-Jumeii doesn't represent the journalist, but said he is keeping tabs on cases dealing with ""A Thick Red Line."" The lawyer is attempting to pursue an appeal for his client and get his case heard in a special court that only deals with media matters. CNN has attempted to get comments from Al-Yami and her attorney. Abdul Jawad, 32, an airline employee and divorced father of four, spoke openly on the show about his sexual escapades, his love of sex and losing his virginity at age 14. That episode caused an uproar in deeply conservative Saudi Arabia, where sharia, or Islamic law, is practiced. Pre-marital sex is illegal, and unrelated men and women are not permitted to mingle. Saudi authorities shut down LBC offices in Jeddah and Riyadh after the interview aired a few months ago. Abdul Jawad was arrested shortly after the program aired and charged with violating Saudi Arabia's crime of publicizing vice.","Second journalist summoned over controverial Saudi television show .

"(CNN) -- A man died after his car plunged 600 feet off the edge of the Grand Canyon's South Rim, authorities said Tuesday. About 5 million people visit the Grand Canyon in Arizona each year. The Arizona park's regional communications center received several reports of a car driving off the edge about 6 a.m. Monday, according to a written statement. ""Upon arriving at the scene, investigators found tire tracks leading to the edge behind the Thunderbird Lodge and received reports of a single occupant in a blue passenger car driving over the edge,"" the statement said. Rescue personnel descended on ropes and found the vehicle about 600 feet into the canyon. The man's body was recovered shortly afterward, the statement said. The incident occurred near the El Tovar hotel in a village on the canyon's South Rim, park spokeswoman Shannan Marcak said. Authorities have not ruled the death a suicide, she said. ""It has not been ruled anything at this time."" The statement said the National Park Service is investigating. Typically, Marcak said, such investigations take at least a few days. The man has not been identified, she said. Marcak said that within the past five years, she knows of only one other time a car was driven off the edge of the canyon. The Monday statement said plans were being made to retrieve the vehicle and the body. The Grand Canyon, a world famous landmark, receives close to 5 million visitors yearly, according to the National Park Service Web site.","Reports say car drove off South Rim of canyon about 6 a.m. Monday .

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- The head of a leading Russian human rights group accused the presidents of Russia and Chechnya of complicity in murdering their top activist in Chechnya. Natalya Estemirova, pictured in 2007, had been openly critical of Chechnya's president, Ramzan Kadyrov. ""I am confident about who killed Natalya Estemirova. We all know this person. His name is Ramzan Kadyrov, President of the Chechen republic,"" Oleg Orlov, the chairman of the Russian human rights group Memorial said on the group's Web site Thursday. ""Ramzan was intimidating and insulting Natalya, and considered her his personal enemy. We don't know whether it was him personally who ordered her [murder] or it were his aides who wanted to please their boss. As far as [Russian] President [Dmitry] Medvedev is concerned, it seems that he doesn't mind having a murderer as head of one of the Russian regions."" Estemirova, 50, was kidnapped outside her home in Chechnya Wednesday, Orlov said, citing eyewitnesses, and found dead in the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia later the same day. Her body was riddled with bullets, Russian prosecutors said -- several shots to the abdomen, and one to the head. The winner of three international human rights awards, she was a leading activist in the North Caucasus area who had been openly critical of Kadyrov and his methods. Kadyrov vowed Thursday that he would personally oversee the investigation and assure her killers were punished. ""She couldn't have had enemies among reasonable people,"" he said in a statement on the Chechen government Web site. ""Those who took away her life have no right to be called humans, they don't deserve any mercy, and should be punished as the most cruel criminals. ""I have no doubts whatsoever that those who ordered and conducted this crime will face trial,"" he said. ""That is the very least that the government and society must do in commemoration of Estemirova."" Medvedev said Thursday the murder was ""a very sad event,"" adding it was ""absolutely clear... her murder is linked to her professional activities. ""Her type of professional activity is needed by any normal state. She did very useful things. She spoke the truth. She openly, sometimes harshly assessed some types of processes that occurred in our country, and this is the value of human rights workers, even if they are not comfortable,"" Medvedev said Thursday on a visit to Germany. His host, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, warned the killing could affect Russian-German relations. ""This is an unacceptable event, and especially if we want to intensify the relations between our two countries, it cannot remain unsolved,"" she said in a joint appearance with Medvedev. Medvedev had earlier condemned the murder and said her killers should punished to the full extent of the law, his office said. Estemirova shouted that she was being kidnapped, as she was forced into a white Lada automobile that had stopped on the road in front of her house on Wednesday morning, Orlov said. An unidentified man grabbed her and shoved her into the car, Orlov told CNN. Estemirova had spent years investigating human rights abuses in Chechnya, the restive Russian republic where Russian forces have fought two conflicts against separatists since 1991. Russia officially ended its military mission in Chechnya in April of this year. The activist told CNN in 2007 she was investigating dozens of abductions and murders that had become the norm in Chechnya, where security forces were fighting a dirty war against separatist rebels. She joins a growing list of journalists and activists killed after criticizing the Russian authorities, many of whose murders remain officially unsolved. Top United States and European officials condemned the murder of Estemirova and demanded that the killers be brought to justice. ""Such a heinous crime sends a chilling signal to Russian civil society and the international community and illustrates the tragic deterioration of security and the rule of law in the North Caucasus over the last several months,"" U.S. National Security Council spokesman Mike Hammer said in a statement. ""How many more Natalya Estemirovas and Anna Politkovskayas must be killed before the Russian authorities protect people who stand up for the human rights of Russian citizens?"" Council of Europe Secretary General Terry Davis demanded, referring to the Russian investigative journalist who was killed in 2006. The Committee to Protect Journalists said in a written statement that Estemirova had ""uncovered massive, ongoing human rights violations in Chechnya by the federal and regional authorities."" ""The killers of this courageous reporter, one of the few left in Chechnya, must not be allowed to walk free like so many before them,"" CPJ Deputy Director Robert Mahoney said. She won three international awards for human rights activities -- including the inaugural Anna Politkovskaya Award, named for the murdered journalist with whom she often worked. Estemirova was Politkovskaya's ""most frequent companion during travel and investigations in Chechnya,"" the organization Reach All Women in War said in announcing the prize for Estemirova. ""They investigated a number of cases together -- about which Anna wrote for (the newspaper) Novaya Gazeta and Natalya wrote for Memorial's Web site and for local newspapers."" Estemirova studied history at Grozny University, then taught history before turning to journalism and human rights in 1998, Memorial said. She joined the organization in March 2000. CNN's Senior International Correspondent Matthew Chance, Maxim Tkachenko and Mike Sefanov in Moscow, Russia, contributed to this report.","Estemirova was abducted outside her home in Grozny, Chechnya .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The United States fears recent weapons purchases by Venezuela could fuel an arms race in South America, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday. Uruguayan President Tabare Vazquez met and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Washington on Tuesday. ""They outpace all other countries in South America and certainly raise the question as to whether there is going to be an arms race in the region,"" Clinton said about Venezuela's arms deals, after a meeting with Uruguayan President Tabare Vazquez. The Russian government Monday extended $2.2 billion in credit to Venezuela to finance arms purchases, including 92 Soviet-era T-72 tanks and short-range missiles with a reach of 55 miles (90 kilometers). Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez also said his nation will purchase an anti-aircraft weapons system with a range of 185 miles (300 kilometers). The planned arms purchases come at a time when Venezuela is at odds with neighboring Colombia over negotiations that would give U.S. troops access to Colombian military bases. Chavez has said his military buildup is in response to the growing U.S. presence in the region, which he calls threatening and dangerous to Latin America. The United States is also concerned about deepening ties between Venezuela and Iran. In addition to ongoing military cooperation, Chavez said in Tehran last week that the Iranian government would help Venezuela develop nuclear technology. In exchange, Venezuela has offered to export gasoline to Iran, which would give Tehran an out if Western nations impose petroleum sanctions over Iran's nuclear program. Senior administration officials say Venezuela's attempt at ""sanctions busting"" is alarming. Clinton urged Venezuela to be transparent about its weapons purchases. Venezuela, she said, ""should be putting in place in procedures and practices to ensure that the weapons they buy are not diverted to insurgent groups or illegal organizations like drug trafficking gangs and other criminal cartels."" Vazquez voiced concern that an arms race in South America would divert funds from badly needed development in poor countries. ""We should devote our energies and resources to fight against the real scourges of our societies ... such as drug trafficking and terrorism,"" he said. ""Instead of spending it in weapons, spending it in housing, good housing for our people, and to further deepen investment, especially in the field of education.""","Russia extends $2.2 billion in credit to Venezuela to finance arms purchases .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- Samar Saed Abdullah's entire body trembles as she speaks about her impending execution. She thinks of the gallows room, the noose around her neck and that moment when she will take her final breath. Samar Saed Abdullah is sentenced to die by hanging in connection with the killing of three relatives. ""My life is meaningless,"" she said, choking on her tears. ""I can't think of anything else. The other women, we try to help each other, but we cannot escape the reality that we are on death row and they can take us at any second."" The 27-year-old Iraqi woman is sentenced to die in connection with the slayings of three relatives in January 2005. She looks pale and frail, her face sallow, her eyes bloodshot. She shakes with each sob, anxiously twisting a tissue in her hands. We first met Samar in spring 2007, at al-Kadhimiya Women's Prison in Baghdad. She had been on death row for about two years, and she was terrified.  Watch a tearful plea from death row » . ""I don't sleep at all on Wednesdays,"" she said then. ""I stay up from morning until night, because that's the day they pick for executions."" Samar was sentenced to death by hanging for being an accessory to murder in the killings of her uncle, aunt and cousin -- slayings that she says were carried out at their home by her husband-to-be, who remains on the loose. She maintains that she is innocent, and there are disturbing questions about her conviction. Samar has now been moved a step closer to death: to Baghdad's maximum-security prison, where there are more than 500 prisoners waiting to be executed. It's the same facility where Saddam Hussein was hanged in December 2006. CNN was not allowed to film her face inside the prison. During the interview, the wardens also seemed to make motions to try to stop CNN from broaching the subject of her allegation that she had only confessed under torture. The day of the killings is seared into her mind. ""I think about it every day, every hour. I wake up with it in my head,"" she said. ""It's the reason I am here."" There was a point in time when Samar was happy, when her life had meaning and joy. She had a fiancé, Saif Ali Nur, in winter 2004. ""I was so happy at the time, when he asked for my hand in marriage,"" she remembered bitterly. ""I thought that he was honest, that he did not lie to me. It all happened in just two months."" At first, her family didn't approve of the romance, but they eventually relented. One day, she says, Saif duped her into taking him to her wealthy uncle's house. He locked her in the kitchen and, she says, shot her uncle, aunt and cousin. Then, he turned the gun on her. Samar says he stole less than $1,000 after threatening to kill Samar and her family if she went to the authorities. The Iraqi police picked Samar up the next day, after Saif dumped her in front of her house and disappeared. ""There was nothing that made me suspect that this was a guy who would do something like this,"" she said. She's filled with regret that she fell in love with him. ""And now I am here in prison, and he is out on the streets, happy."" Her parents sold everything to pay for her defense. They swear she's innocent. She says she was tortured by the police into confessing that she went to her uncle's house with the intent to steal. ""They kept beating me, and they told me, 'Say whatever we want you to say, and do not say anything else, and say yes, I was an accomplice to this crime.' Although I had nothing to do with it. Finally, they made me sign a blank piece of paper, and they filled it out afterwards."" She was tried and convicted in a single day: August 15, 2005. Court documents obtained by CNN read that ""the court discussed the case file with her and she said that all that she had confessed came as a result of duress and torture."" Under Iraqi law, the court should have investigated her claim that she confessed under torture. But it did not. After learning of Samar's case from CNN, former Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih said Tuesday he spoke with the Iraqi Presidency Council, which promised to look into the matter. He also said he had spoken separately with top Iraqi officials, including Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, and urged for a new trial. Human rights groups say Samar's case is just one of many in which justice has failed. And they say that what makes implementing capital punishment even more disturbing is that the Iraqi judicial system does not guarantee a fair trial. Amnesty International issued a report Tuesday saying that at least 1,000 prisoners sit on Iraq's death row and that Iraq now has one of the highest execution rates in the world. The report says Iraq's court system does not meet international standards and that authorities ""provide very little information on executions, and some have been carried out secretly."" According to a Western official with in-depth knowledge of the Iraqi judicial system, Iraq's judicial failures are ""rooted in the legal culture rather than the law. ... The entire legal culture remains heavily confession-based, a situation exacerbated by the frequently imperfect investigative skills of the police, judicial investigators and investigative judges."" In his years in Iraq, this official says he observed judges taking payments in exchange for certain decisions and the physical abuse of suspects, either as an end in itself or to ""encourage"" confessions. ""It is my firmly held opinion that Iraq should immediately reinstate the moratorium on executions,"" the official said. ""There are serious problems plaguing the administration of justice in Iraq in criminal cases, and this fact is widely acknowledged by the Iraq judges, prosecutors and defense counsel."" The U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority abolished capital punishment in Iraq after Saddam Hussein was toppled in 2003. But the death penalty was reinstated in August 2004, shortly after the government was handed back to Iraqis. Iraq's Ministry of Justice maintains that the judicial system is ""fair and just."" Local organizations like the Organization for Women's Freedom in Iraq have for years been fighting to get the death penalty abolished in Iraq, especially when it comes to flawed trials and women being put to death. But they struggle against a government that turns a deaf ear. ""I wish there was some kind of response. But the response is totally passive. We've reached a degree of despair,"" said Yanar Mohammed, founder of the Organization for Women's Freedom in Iraq. ""As a human rights organization in Iraq, we find that we need some backup from abroad to put pressure on our government as a first step to stop the executions of these women, some of whom we know are innocent."" But even as doubts surface about many convictions in Iraq, there are signs that the pace of executions is picking up. Over the past two months, Mohammed's group says, between two and four women were executed. ""They were taken out of the extreme-protection prison,"" Mohammed said. ""It is a very scary story for us, because if it starts with a few women in a jail cell ... it could happen to hundreds, thousands of people later on."" As for Samar, she doesn't sleep, haunted by the image of her body that could be hanging lifeless -- plagued by the gut-wrenching fear of death that consumes her nights and most of her days. ""Every night, I stay up thinking that if tomorrow comes, who will be next? Me? Or my friend sitting next to me?"" She sobbed. ""I will never trust a man again. I will never love anyone again. I just want to stay with my parents."" Samar feels betrayed, both by the man she once loved and by a judicial system that is about to send her to her death. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","Woman sobs about impending execution: ""I can't think of anything else""

"Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- A 13-year-old who witnessed another teen being set on fire last month apologized Tuesday, saying he is praying for the boy's recovery and he is sorry for what happened. Reading to reporters from a statement, Jeremy Jarvis -- whose older brother has been charged in the incident -- said that victim Michael Brewer is in his prayers. ""I want to read something I wrote last night,"" Jarvis said. ""I want to express my deepest sympathy to Mikey and his family. I will pray for Mikey to grow stronger every day and for Mikey's speedy recovery."" Brewer, 15, remains in guarded condition at the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center. He suffered third-degree burns over 65 percent of his body in the Deerfield Beach, Florida, incident October 12, authorities have said. Police have been able to interview Brewer for the first time since the incident, the Broward County Sheriff's Office said. Hospital officials have said Brewer can communicate only in one- or two-word answers. ""The more information we have, the better position we are in to make the right decision"" as far as charges and how to proceed, said Maria Schneider, a prosecutor with the state attorney's office in Broward County. ""I would say he [Brewer] needs a little more time to be fully prepared to provide a detailed account of the incident."" ""It was difficult. It was difficult for him to talk about. Difficult for us to listen to,"" she said of the interview. ""Just difficult all around, heart-wrenching. He's doing so much better, but it's such a terrible situation."" Jeremy Jarvis was arrested as a juvenile after Brewer was burned and spent about 30 days in juvenile detention. However, prosecutors have not filed charges against him. He still could be charged, as prosecutors have 90 days from his arrest to decide whether to move forward with the case. He has not been interviewed by police or prosecutors, Schneider said. ""He has invoked his rights to counsel and has invoked his rights to silence."" His brother, Denver, 15, is among three teenagers charged as adults with one count of attempted second-degree murder in the attack. He has pleaded not guilty. ""I want to tell my brother D.C. I love and miss him,"" Jeremy Jarvis told reporters Tuesday. ""I just hope and pray we all get through this."" The boy's attorney, Stephen Melnick, would not allow reporters to ask him questions. The extent of Jeremy Jarvis' involvement remains under investigation, Melnick said, adding that police took a statement from Brewer on Monday. ""As far as we know, he [Jeremy Jarvis] just followed and watched what happened,"" he said. Denver Jarvis and Matthew Bent, also 15, are accused along with a third teen, Jesus Mendez, 16, of being in a group that poured alcohol over Brewer and set him ablaze in a dispute over $40, a video game and a bicycle. All three pleaded not guilty in an appearance last week in Broward County Circuit Court. If convicted, they would face a sentence of up to 30 years in prison. Detectives say eyewitnesses told them that Mendez used a lighter to set fire to Brewer after Denver Jarvis allegedly poured alcohol over him. Bent allegedly encouraged the attack, police said. Brewer jumped into a pool at his apartment complex to put out the flames. Authorities have said Mendez admitted setting Brewer on fire. According to an arrest transcript, the boy said he made a ""bad decision."" Dr. Michael Brannon, a court-appointed forensic psychologist, interviewed both the Jarvis brothers. ""I can describe both of them as being afraid, being fearful,"" he told CNN earlier this month. ""I can describe both of them as being tearful at various times during the interview, especially when talking about the specific incident which led to the injuries of the victim."" The Jarvis family met at Melnick's office Tuesday, shortly before the boy read the short written statement to reporters. He took no questions. During the meeting, Jeremy Jarvis played with Melnick's dog. Although the state can still file charges against him, ""it didn't matter to him,"" Melnick said. ""It was important to say how this really bothers him and how much he loves his brother and how much he hopes Michael gets better."" He said Brewer is a close friend of Jeremy Jarvis, and the boy is troubled by Brewer's injury as well as by his brother facing criminal charges that could land him in an adult prison if convicted. Doctors had planned to perform skin graft surgery on Brewer last Friday, but decided to wait and let him heal a bit more first, hospital officials said. His doctor has said he faces several more months in the hospital and will need multiple skin grafts and surgeries. Melnick would not say whether Jeremy Jarvis is cooperating with prosecutors, but said he didn't believe the boy's apology would affect whether charges are filed. ""It's something he's been wanting to say from the start,"" he said. ""He's been asking every day if he could say something."" Broward County schools expelled the seventh-grader after his arrest, Melnick said. He is being home-schooled, and his family is exploring alternative education arrangements. Jeremy Jarvis turned 13 about a month ago, but ""he understands what's happening,"" Melnick said. ""He spent 30 days in a jail.""","Jeremy Jarvis, 13, who saw teen set on fire, apologizes, says he's praying for recovery .

"(CNN) -- In trendy neighborhoods of Tokyo customers are lining up for vitamin injections that promise to improve health and beauty. These intravenous vitamin ""drips"" are part of the latest quick-fix, health fad catching on in Japan: the IV cafe. Each drip pack contains saline solution and specific vitamins and minerals to target a particular health ailment or beauty concern. ""I used to take vitamin supplements, but changed to the IV drip because I feel the effects more quickly,"" a 20-something woman at the Tenteki 10 Café told CNN. She said she receives specific injections to get better skin, burn fat and boost her energy. There are 10 different varieties to choose from at Tenteki. The ""orange"" variety touts anti-aging properties, loaded with antioxidants. The ""placenta pack"" is said to help rejuvenate and ease muscle stiffness. Prices range from $20 to $30 per injection, and nurses see about 30 to 40 people each day. Their most common patients are Japanese businessmen who work in the same office building. ""I see a lot of businessmen who say they don't have time to sleep. They can't take a break from working and get the vitamin drip for an extra kick of energy,"" a Tenteki nurse told CNN. ""Blue"" is the most requested vitamin pack among these men: a concoction of B1 and vitamin E that claims to offer relief from exhaustion. Registered nurses and doctors administer the drips at Tenteki, but there's no conclusive medical evidence to back up the health claims. Many nutritionists actually caution against using injectable vitamin supplements because the quantities are not regulated. ""More is not necessarily better...some vitamins and minerals can be toxic in high doses,"" particularly the fat-soluble ones which the body stores like Vitamins A, D, E and K, explained Claire Williamson, Nutrition Scientist at the British Nutrition Foundation. In Europe and the United States vitamin shots are popular among celebrities with hectic lifestyles and little time to sleep, particularly vitamin B 12. Former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell and singer Robbie Williams have both confirmed they've used the shots as part of their diets to maintain stamina during tours. Dermatological injections of Vitamin C are also popular among women hoping to keep their skin looking young. Former supermodel Cindy Crawford has admitted using such injections to keep her skin firm and wrinkle-free. According to Williamson, it does not matter if supplements are injected into the vein or into the skin. ""At the end of the day it will go into the blood stream,"" she said.

"(CNN)  -- Juventus have sacked coach Ciro Ferrara after a string of poor results and have installed Alberto Zaccheroni in the hot seat until the end of the season. Ferrara's position has been threatened after a dismal run which has seen them slip out of contention in the Serie A title race as well as being eliminated from the Champions League at the group stages. Thursday's 2-1 Coppa Italia defeat to Italian champions Inter Milan proved the final straw and the club released a statement to confirm his departure and Zaccheroni's arrival. ""Zaccheroni will take over the team immediately and will guide this afternoon's training session in Vinovo before being officially unveiled to the media,"" it read. Ferrara joined Juve late last season and steered the Turin powerhouses to second place in Serie A behind Inter. But his first full campaign in charge proved challenging after a promising start to the season. The Bianconeri have lost five of their last six games in Serie A and have slumped to sixth in the standings, four points behind Napoli, who hold the last Champions League qualifying spot. Zaccheroni will hope to get them on track with his first game against Lazio on Sunday. The 56-year-old has coached at a number of leading Serie A clubs and helped AC Milan to the 1999 Italian title, but it is his first job since being sacked by Torino in February 2007. Ferrara, a former Italy international and Juventus defender, was given the reins despite his lack of experience, succeeding current Roma coach Claudio Ranieri, who was fired. Zaccheroni's appointment ends, for now, media speculation that Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez would take charge at Juve, but the short-term nature of his contract until June raises questions about the permanence of his stay. Benitez acknowledged the speculation in his weekly press conference on Friday. ""I am focused on preparing my team for the game against Bolton. I know they (Juventus) were interested, that is part of the game now in football, but I am not ready to talk too much because I don't want to lose my focus. ""When you are a manager and you have clubs asking (for you), you have to be proud because they are a top side in Europe, but I am really happy here and want to do my job as best I can.""","Juventus sack coach Ciro Ferrara after a string of poor results in Serie A and Europe .

"Brussels, Belgium (CNN) -- European Union leaders named Belgian Prime Minister Herman Van Rompuy as the first ""president of Europe"" Thursday, edging out former British Prime Minister Tony Blair for a still-vaguely defined job. ""I did not seek this high position, and I didn't take any steps to achieve it,"" Van Rompuy said in accepting the job. ""But tonight, I take on this task with conviction and with enthusiasm."" Van Rompuy, a 62-year-old, soft-spoken fan of Japanese poetry, will become the face of European Union and represent its 27 member nations at summits overseas. His conservative government took office in December 2008. The Belgian is ""well known as a consensus builder,"" said British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who added the selection was unanimous. And Jose Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission -- the executive arm of the EU -- called Van Rompuy's selection ""a tribute to Belgium,"" the EU's host country. "" I think the European Union also expressed its gratitude for the work of Belgium and the constant support that this country at the heart of Europe has given to our common project,"" he said. In his speech, Van Rompuy pledged to lead the EU through a process of ""dialogue, unity and action."" ""A negotiation that ends with a defeated party is never a good negotiation,"" he said. ""As president of the council, I will listen carefully to everyone, and I will make sure that all deliberations turn into results for everyone."" The presidency was created by the European Union's Lisbon Treaty, which came into force this month after years of torturous negotiations. Van Rompuy will serve a two-and-a-half-year term, replacing the six-month presidency of the bloc that rotated among the heads of its member states. But while the EU prides itself on being a club of democracies, the process of choosing its new leader was far from transparent or open. The people of Europe are getting no say, not even through their parliamentarians. Van Rompuy's new job was announced after a closed-door dinner for the EU's heads of state and government. The Belgian defended the process, telling reporters the selection was made by leaders ""who were all democratically chosen."" ""I was chosen on the basis of a treaty,"" he said. ""The treaty stipulates the procedure. The treaty was democratically approved by 27 member states."" The EU leaders also named Catherine Ashton, a British trade commissioner and member of the House of Lords, as the union's High Commissioner -- its equivalent of a foreign minister. Unlike Van Rompuy, who was chosen by leaders of the EU's member states, Ashton must be confirmed by the European Parliament. Blair, who led Britain from 1997 to 2007, is currently the EU's Mideast envoy. He had been the early favorite for the presidency in recent weeks -- but Brown, his successor, realized that he lacked support among key decision-makers for new post, a Brown representative told CNN earlier. According his backers, who at first included French President Nicolas Sarkozy, he was just the sort of world-renowned figure to win attention for the EU and enable it to exercise its weight in world affairs. One Indian official told CNN before the announcement, ""If the EU chooses as its worldwide representative the prime minister of Belgium or Luxembourg, I am not sure our leaders will have the time to meet him."" But others were soon arguing that Blair's support for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and his close alliance with former U.S. President George W. Bush made him a divisive figure in Europe. And as the one man who might have been able to take Britain into the European single currency, he had not even attempted to do so while he was Britain's prime minister. Public backing from Italy's Silvio Berlusconi, a joke figure to much of Europe and another Bush ally, did not help. Brown had realized earlier that Blair did not have enough support among key decision-makers to snag the new post, a Brown representative told CNN earlier.

"(CNN) -- A Muslim woman and the Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations sued a judge Wednesday for allegedly ordering the woman to remove her hijab, or religious head covering, in court. Raneen Albaghdady, of Wayne County, Michigan, contends that Judge William Callahan told her to remove her hijab on June 16 when she was petitioning for a name change, according to the lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday in a U.S. district court in Michigan. Wayne County is also listed as a defendant in the suit. Callahan and the 3rd Circuit Court of Michigan said in a written statement that they had not seen the complaint and could not comment on the lawsuit. However, they said that Albaghdady did not object to removing her head covering and that she had not informed the judge that she wore it for religious reasons. The lawsuit says Callahan ""insisted"" that Albaghdady, a naturalized citizen, remove her hijab and that she eventually complied. It says the judge denied Albaghdady's petition for a name change, saying that she had filed her petition five days too early. No further details were offered. The lawsuit seeks an order declaring the practice of ""forcing Muslim women to remove their hijab as a precondition to appearing in court"" unconstitutional and illegal. It asks that the judge and Wayne County not be allowed to ""take similar unconstitutional actions."" The Michigan Islamic relations council released a partial video of the incident Tuesday on YouTube. In the 30-second video, the judge can be heard saying, ""The head piece? No hats allowed in the courtroom."" The statement from Callahan and the 3rd Circuit said that the YouTube video was ""missing some critical footage."" ""In response to Judge Callahan's direction, 'No hats allowed in the courtroom,' Ms. Albaghdady responded, ""Okay, it doesn't matter,' and immediately removed her head covering, without protest or explanation,"" the statement said. ""Judge Callahan and the court have the greatest respect for spiritual practices and all religious preferences. Had he been informed that the head covering had some religious significance, the judge would have permitted Ms. Albaghdady to continue wearing it in court,"" it said. The suit comes a day after the state's Supreme Court issued an order allowing lower state courts to ""exercise reasonable control"" over the appearance of witnesses and parties to lawsuits, a rule change that had been proposed after a Muslim woman refused to remove an Islamic garment in a small claims court. The order allows courts ""reasonable control over the appearance of parties and witnesses"" so as to ""ensure that the demeanor of such persons may be observed and assessed by the fact-finder and ensure the accurate identification of such person."" The order, which amends a rule of the Michigan Rules of Evidence, is effective September 1. The justices had voted earlier this summer to change it. The amendment was prompted by a 2006 small claims case in Michigan filed by Ginnah Muhammad, who wore a niqab -- a garment that covers the entire face and head, except for the eyes -- to court, the order said. The judge asked her to remove her niqab, saying he needed to be able to see her face to tell whether she was telling the truth, according to court documents. Muhammad refused, saying she was a practicing Muslim and would take off the veil only in front of a female judge. The judge said a female judge was not available and told Muhammad she could remove the niqab or have her case dismissed. She chose the latter, according to court documents. She sued the judge in federal district court, which declined to exercise jurisdiction over the case. Muhammad has since appealed to the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, according to court documents. Michigan is home to about 600,000 Muslims, and close to 500,000 live in the southeastern part of the state, according to the Michigan office of the American-Islamic relations council. The Detroit area, in Wayne County, ranks fifth nationwide for the number of Muslims, it said. Last month, the Judicial Council of Georgia adopted a policy allowing religious head coverings in the state's courtrooms. Daniel Mach, the director of litigation for the American Civil Liberties Union's Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief, said Wednesday the issue has ""come up in a variety of states."" ""We are concerned about the growing number of incidents restricting religious expression in the courtroom,"" he said. ""... This is an issue that affects a variety of religious faiths and others.""","Lawsuit claims naturalized citizen was forced to remove religious head covering .

"(The Frisky) -- Who was the first person you called the day your ex dumped you? Or that time you found a weird bump? Or the day you stumbled across that pair of barely worn Christian Louboutins at the Goodwill? You need to break connections with ""friends"" who only bring negative things into your life. If you're like me, you called a girlfriend. While I love my man, and adore my cats to what some might consider a scary degree, the relationships I have with my girls is on an entirely different plane. They're the funniest, smartest, weirdest (in a good way!) gaggle of broads I've ever met and I feel lucky every day to have them around. It wasn't always this way. I've had to prune my posse (please note that I've also been kicked out of people's lives as well) and have discovered some types to avoid. Drama queen . The Drama Queen isn't happy (and ""happy"" is a relative term here) unless she's freaking out. Little things us boring normals would shrug off -- like a missed bus or parking ticket -- become monumental shriekfests. She doesn't get the flu, she gets oh-my-god-I-think-it's-cancer! Everything is a crisis, and she demands constant handholding and attention. The Frisky: 13 signs she's a loser . Luckily, these types can't help but reveal their true colors pretty quickly and unless you're content to be cast as an extra in your own life, you'll banish her from the set. Nurse Betty . There is nothing that makes this one as happy as a friend in need. This may seem like a good quality (and often is -- for a while), but once you've got your butt back in gear, she either loses interest or, worse, reminds you constantly of how bad things once were, in the hopes that you'll fall back into feeling like crap so she can ""save"" you again. The Frisky: Is it evil to talk a friend out of getting married? You have two choices with this type -- either arrange it so you're constantly in crisis, or pretend you're problem-free so she gets bored. Better yet, introduce her to the drama queen --they'll be very happy together. Lady-hater . ""I don't have female friends because all the women I meet are jealous of me."" Yes, someone actually said this to me. Instead, this person prefers her friends to be of the male variety -- ideally hopelessly in love with her and willing to do her bidding. The Frisky: How do grown women make friends? You don't really have to worry about ditching this snot because she doesn't want anything to do with you in the first place. The critic . Also known as the frenemy, the critic is chockfull of helpful suggestions. For instance, you know your favorite dress? Well, it makes you look kind of fat. No offense. Speaking of which -- have you gained a little weight? Or are you pregnant? Are you sure? Well, never mind, you can have some of her old ""fat"" clothes since she has no use for them anymore. Understandably, Critics have a fairly high turnover rate in the friend department. I unfriended one such mean girl only to have her show up at a mutual friend's birthday party -- for the sole purpose of telling the birthday girl exactly what was wrong with her! ¡Feliz Cumpleaños! The leg humper . Do you know what it's like to walk into a bar and find one of your closest friends making out with the guy you've had a crush on for an entire year? I do! Granted, that's nowhere near as bad as my friend Melissa who discovered her husband was schtupping her BFF, but still. It stung. And sure, nobody forced Melissa's husband to be a cheating jerk, but a good girlfriend never would've gone there with him. The Frisky: Why you should not pursue a taken man . You'll know when you're in the presence of one of these bottom-feeders by the way you become invisible the second there's a guy in the vicinity. So yeah, I had to learn the hard way. But having been put through the wringer by these types of lady-scoundrels makes me doubly appreciate the awesome dames I still have in my life. The Frisky: When good friends go bad .

"(CNN) -- NASA said Friday it had discovered water on the moon, opening ""a new chapter"" that could allow for the development of a lunar space station. The discovery was announced by project scientist Anthony Colaprete at a midday news conference. ""I'm here today to tell you that indeed, yes, we found water. And we didn't find just a little bit; we found a significant amount"" -- about a dozen, two-gallon bucketfuls, he said, holding up several white plastic containers. The find is based on preliminary data collected when the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, or LCROSS, intentionally crashed October 9 into the permanently shadowed region of Cabeus crater near the moon's south pole. After the satellite struck, a rocket flew through the debris cloud, measuring the amount of water and providing a host of other data, Colaprete said. The project team concentrated on data from the satellite's spectrometers, which provide the best information about the presence of water, Colaprete said. A spectrometer helps identify the composition of materials by examining light they emit or absorb. Although the goal of the $79 million mission was to determine whether there is water on the moon, discoveries in other areas are expected as studies progress, Colaprete and other scientists said at the briefing at NASA's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field near San Francisco, California. ""The discovery opens a new chapter in our understanding of the moon,"" the space agency said in a written statement shortly after the briefing began. Michael Wargo, chief lunar scientist at NASA headquarters in Washington, said the latest discovery also could unlock the mysteries of the solar system. He listed several options as sources for the water, including solar winds, comets, giant molecular clouds or even the moon itself through some kind of internal activity. The Earth also may have a role, Wargo said. ""If the water that was formed or deposited is billions of years old, these polar cold traps could hold a key to the history and evolution of the solar system, much as an ice core sample taken on Earth reveals ancient data,"" NASA said in its statement. ""In addition, water and other compounds represent potential resources that could sustain future lunar exploration.""","NASA: Discovery could allow for development of lunar space station .

"BOSTON, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Everyone knows Boston is a city steeped in history, but on a steamy hot summer day, one of the best places to experience the city is from the ocean or the harbor. Codzilla boats zip passengers around Boston's inner harbor. A new high-speed thrill ride called Codzilla -- a 70-foot turbocharged boat that makes 180-degree turns at close to 40 knots (43 mph) -- takes passengers out of the inner harbor into the Atlantic. White-knuckled riders are tied down with seat belts but still hold on to the railings with one hand and cling to their belongings with the other so they don't fly overboard. Teenage boys like Ben Whatley from Michigan think Codzilla is ""pretty cool."" Younger brother Jeremy agrees while huddling with his grandmother. If you want both history and a boat ride, take one of Boston's famous Duck Tours. Operated on amphibious vehicles from World War II, the tours take you through downtown historic Boston. Then the bus becomes a sea-going vessel, settling into the harbor for a short cruise. It's a great way to see both sides of the city. When you get back on land, the New England Aquarium awaits with a ""Sharks and Rays"" exhibit that wraps up September 1. It includes a large touch tank where visitors can pet stingrays and small sharks. Megan Moore, a visitor program specialist at the aquarium, is excited to teach people that most sharks are not scary. Out of the 900 different species of sharks and rays, Moore says, only 10 to 15 have ever been known to attack a human, mostly because they confuse people with food. Sea dragons, jellyfish and harbor seals are among the other sea creatures on display at the aquarium. If you'd rather see animals in their own habitat, you can board a whale watch tour at the harbor just outside the aquarium. Tours take about three hours on a high-speed catamaran to the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary. It's been a protected area since 1992 and is a rich feeding ground for all kinds of marine life. Tour operators guarantee whale sightings on every excursion. Visitors this year are seeing large numbers of humpback, fin and even endangered right whales. There are also lots of dolphins, seals and sea birds. Finally, to experience Boston in a historic way, head to the Public Garden and take a peaceful 20-minute glide in a Swan Boat. The boats have been an important part of the garden every spring and summer since 1877. Operator and owner Lyn Paget's great-grandfather got the idea for the first boat from the opera Lohengrin, in which a prince rescues his princess in a boat drawn by a swan. Paget calls the experience ""magical"" because the world speeds ahead but the Swan Boats never change. ""We have generations of people that have passed through here. When you come down with a friend, or child or a grandchild, their experience is going to be the same that it was for you, and there aren't too many places where you can do that anymore,"" Paget said. Fran Fifis is a senior producer who has worked in CNN's Boston bureau since it opened in 1998.","Boston's harbor and ocean attractions are great choices for summer visitors .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The White House released the text Monday of a controversial back-to-school speech to students from President Obama. The uproar over President Obama's back-to-school speech led the White House to release the transcript Monday. Many conservatives have expressed a fear that the address would be used to push a partisan political agenda. In the text of the speech, however, Obama avoids any mention of controversial political initiatives. He repeatedly urges students to work hard and stay in school. ""No matter what you want to do with your life, I guarantee that you'll need an education to do it,"" he says. ""This isn't just important for your own life and your own future. What you make of your education will decide nothing less than the future of this country."" The text of the 18-minute speech was posted on the White House Web site so people can read it before its scheduled Internet broadcast to schoolchildren Tuesday. Read text of Obama's speech to students (pdf) Some of the president's critics have been adamantly opposed to the idea of an address by Obama to children. ""The president's speeches tend to be [about] what's wrong with the country and what can we do to fix it,"" said Bill Hogsett, a parent from Dallas, Texas. ""I believe this is the greatest country on Earth, and I try to teach that to my children. ... I don't want them hearing that there's a fundamental flaw with the country and the kids need to go forward to fix it."" Hogsett, who spoke Monday shortly before Obama's remarks were released, said he wanted to read the speech before making a final judgment. Amy Veasley, another parent from the Dallas area, said she was surprised by the controversy. ""The president of our country wants to call our students to action. I'm not sure why parents wouldn't want their students to hear out the leader of our country,"" she said. A Baltimore, Maryland, teacher who asked not to be identified bemoaned the fact that the country has ""become so polarized that we believe that our president is an enemy and not our leader."" During Bush's presidency, she said, ""whether I disagreed or not, I still saw him as a leader."" On Sunday, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said that parents who are threatening to keep their children home Tuesday to avoid Obama's speech were being ""silly."" Appearing on the CBS program ""Face the Nation,"" Duncan emphasized that it is up to school officials whether to include the speech in the day's activities and that the message of the speech is simply to encourage children to finish school. ""That's just silly,"" he said of anyone planning to have their kids stay home because of the speech. ""They can go to school. They can not watch."" The speech is about ""the president challenging young people,"" Duncan asserted. Some school administrators have decided to show the president's speech, but others will not.  Watch CNN's Ed Henry talk about school speech uproar » . Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a possible contender for the GOP's 2012 presidential nomination, said Sunday that Obama's speech would disrupt an already-hectic first day of school for many students. ""I think there's concerns about the disruption,"" he said on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" calling the scheduling of the speech a ""little ham-fisted"" by the White House.  Watch school reject Obama's speech on education » . ""There [are] also concerns about is this going to be done in an appropriate manner. I trust and hope that the White House will have a content that is not political and they're not using the public school infrastructure for that purpose."" Duncan, however, noted Obama's speech is not unprecedented. President George H.W. Bush delivered a nationally televised speech to students from a Washington school in fall 1991, encouraging them to say no to drugs and work hard. Read text of Bush's speech to students (pdf) In November 1988, President Reagan delivered more politically charged remarks that were made available to students nationwide. Among other things, Reagan called taxes ""such a penalty on people that there's no incentive for them to prosper ... because they have to give so much to the government."" Read text of Reagan's speech to students (pdf) Some of the controversy over Obama's speech involved a proposed lesson plan created by the Education Department to accompany the address. An initial version of the plan recommended that students draft letters to themselves discussing ""what they can do to help the president."" The letters ""would be collected and redistributed at an appropriate later date by the teacher to make students accountable to their goals,"" the plan stated. After pressure from conservatives, the White House distributed a revised version encouraging students to write letters about how they can ""achieve their short-term and long-term education goals."" Duncan said Sunday that the passage was poorly worded. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told ""Fox News Sunday"" that Obama's speech is a good idea if the message is a positive one about completing school. ""It is good to have the president of the United States say to young people across America, 'Stay in school, study, and do your homework,' "" Gingrich said. Florida Republican Party Chairman Jim Greer last week accused Obama of trying to ""indoctrinate America's children to his socialist agenda."" ""Now that the White House got their hand in the cookie jar caught, they changed everything,"" he said Monday. After reading the text, he said, ""My kids will be watching the president's speech, as I hope all kids will.""

"(CNN) -- Campus police at the University of South Florida were questioning two men in connection with back-to-back incidents on the school campus Monday. Police take a man into custody at the University of South Florida after receiving reports of a person with a bomb. Investigators were questioning one man following a report of an armed intruder, USF police Lt. Meg Ross said. And a second man was also being questioned following a report of a man carrying a large hunting knife and a puppy, she said. USF police asked the Tampa police's bomb team to respond to the campus regarding a backpack belonging to man in the first incident, said Ross. No one was hurt, she said, and no shots were fired. ""We have someone we think may have been involved,"" Ross told CNN, ""but we have to investigate fully."" ""We have not looked in his backpack,"" she added. ""We have the bomb squad on their way to look at that."" Police received a report that a person armed with a bomb and a gun was in the area of the university's library. Authorities later received a report of a subject on a bus in the area of the university's Parking and Transportation Services, Ross said. ""We checked the area at the library, did not locate him, but then received a subsequent report of a subject on a bus,"" she said. The campus stayed on lockdown after police received a report almost immediately after taking the first man into custody of a man wearing a black tank top and a cowboy hat, carrying a knife and a black puppy. ""We're questioning him,"" Ross said. ""We do not believe he is related to the first incident with the backpack."" Text messages were sent out to 13,000 employees and 45,000 students to warn them after the first incident, and emergency sirens on campus also were activated, officials said. But Ross said that the campus had been given the all-clear, except for the shuttle-bus area -- where the first subject was taken into custody -- while Tampa Police examined the backpack.

"London, England (CNN) -- A woman's body was found in a river in Wales, police said Tuesday, the second death from severe flooding that has hit England and Wales since late last week. The body of the woman, who was not named, was found in the River Usk near the village of Talybont, in mid Wales close to the coast, Brecon police said. Search teams had been looking for her since Sunday. Talybont is about 250 miles south of Cockermouth, England, which has experienced some of the worst flooding seen in decades. Friday, parts of Cockermouth were under several feet of water after heavy rainfall the night before. The town sits at the intersection of two rivers, the Cocker and the Derwent, both of which burst their banks and raged through the town. By Tuesday, the flood waters had receded and the clean-up and damage assessment was well under way. But rain was still falling over the entire region, raising fears of further flooding in some areas. Britain's Environment Agency said river levels across the county of Cumbria remained high but are unlikely to rise to levels seen last week. Twenty road bridges in Cumbria were closed Tuesday, including seven that collapsed in the floods, Cumbria County Council spokesman Gareth Cosslett told CNN. Also shut were eight footbridges, which are an essential means of connecting residents in riverside towns. In Workington, where Cumbria Police Constable Bill Barker died in the floods last week, the two sides of the town are cut off from each other because all bridges were either washed away or closed for safety reasons. ""We're hoping to get a temporary road bridge installed in Workington,"" Cosslett said, describing it as the council's first priority. ""We haven't yet confirmed what we're going to do or when that's going to happen, but in all likelihood we're looking at a single-lane temporary bridge with traffic lights on either side."" Cosslett had no estimate on when the bridge could be complete, but he said such a project may take more than a month. The worst weather Tuesday was in Cumbria, where the Met Office, the UK's weather service, predicted heavy and persistent rain and accumulations of 1.2 to 2.4 inches (30 to 60 millimeters). Rain and strong gusts were also forecast for Wales on Tuesday, the Met Office said. The rain was expected to move through the region by Wednesday, but more was set to return by Thursday, according to Met Office forecasts. Sixty-eight flood watches and warnings were in place across England and Wales on Wednesday, the Environment Agency said.","Woman's body found in the River Usk near the village of Talybont, in mid Wales .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Prodding Israel and the Palestinian Authority to restart talks aimed at a permanent resolution of their decades-old conflict, President  Obama dropped a demand for an Israeli settlement freeze, U.S., Israeli and Palestinian officials said. Benjamin Netanyahu, left, President Obama and Mahmoud Abbas. ""Simply put, it is past time to talk about starting negotiations. It is time to move forward,"" Obama told reporters before a meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""It is time to show the flexibility and common sense and sense of compromise that is necessary to achieve our goals,"" Obama said. Obama first met separately with Netanyahu  and Abbas on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in what he called ""frank and productive"" talks. The session was the first among the three leaders since Obama took office in January. George Mitchell, Obama's envoy for the Middle East, attended Tuesday's talks. He said the talks were ""at all times cordial,"" but ""direct"" and sometimes ""blunt."" Obama told Abbas and Netanyahu that, ""The only reason to hold public office is to get things done,"" and that everyone ""must take risks for peace,"" Mitchell said. Mitchell told reporters the U.S. is ""not identifying any issue as being a precondition or an impediment to negotiation."" But the United States and Israel have publicly disagreed on Israeli plans to build more housing on land the Palestinians regard as theirs. Previous Obama administration demands for a freeze have been ignored by the Netanyahu government.  Watch Netanyahu address peace, settlements » . Abbas has so far rejected resuming talks with Israel until the Jewish state halts all settlement building in the occupied West Bank and in predominantly Palestinian East Jerusalem. Arab states also have balked at the U.S. request to take confidence-building measures toward Israel until Israel freezes settlement construction. Sitting with Netanyahu and Abbas, Obama softened his regular language on a settlement ""freeze,"" saying that Israel has had meaningful discussions about ""restraining"" settlement activity. ""But they need to translate these discussions into real action on this and other issues,"" he said. ""Obama told Abbas that he couldn't get the settlement freeze and promised to keep trying, but that it shouldn't be a condition for talks and it was time to move on,"" one Palestinian aide to Abbas said. Several U.S. officials said that Obama told Abbas that although the U.S. believe a settlement freeze would create a better atmosphere for talks to begin, the lack of one should not be used an as excuse not to talk. ""Let's not have the perfect be the enemy of the good,"" Obama told Abbas, according to the officials.  Watch Obama: 'We have to find a way forward' » . ""It's been apparent for some time that the Israelis were going to fall short of what is necessary on the settlement freeze,"" one senior U.S. official said. ""But our view is let's get to negotiations and settlements will be addressed within those final status issues"" A senior Israeli diplomat said Israel agreed to not building any new settlements, no outward expansion of existing growth and to only build for ""natural"" growth within existing settlements. He said Israel also agreed not to encourage Israelis to move to settlements, which would increase the population. ""A complete settlement freeze wasn't physically or politically possible, especially in the absence of any Arab or Palestinian concessions,"" the Israeli diplomat said. ""There was a time the gaps had significantly narrowed, but now they were starting to widen. The administration recognized, rather than have them widen further, we should start negotiating."" The Palestinian aide to  Abbas said Obama's failure to secure a settlement freeze has weakened him in the eyes of the Palestinian delegation, because it casts doubt on his ability to move Israel during final status negotiations. The Palestinians did win an important point, however, with Obama making clear that the peace talks would not start from scratch, which Netanyahu had favored. Rather the talks would take into account progress made in previous negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, the sources said. The Israeli diplomat said that Israel would ""take into account"" the previous negotiations, but stressed his country's longstanding position that ""nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to."" Obama also addressed Abbas' desire to have the terms for negotiations more clearly defined, asking Israeli and Palestinian negotiators to come to Washington next week for further talks. Next week's talks, to be led by George Mitchell, will center on what issues will be addressed at negotiations, which will present the U.S. with its next big challenge. Palestinians want negotiations to resolve the ""final status"" issues of the conflict, such as borders, Jerusalem and the right of return for Palestinian refugees. Israel wants to begin with talks on a ""provisional"" Palestinian state.","NEW: Israel agrees to some limits on West Bank settlement growth .

"(CNN) -- Who would open one of the world's biggest casinos in the depths of a global recession? Big city dreams: Lawrence Ho's business portfolio in Hong Kong and Macau is growing. Answer: Lawrence Ho, the scion of a casino business mogul who has clearly inherited his father's love of a calculated risk. Ho's father Stanley is a man synonymous with the creation of Macau as the world's biggest gambling destination. ""Over the past 40 years he has put his thumbprints all over Macau. I think if you look at the major infrastructure projects, whether it's the airport, the ferry terminals, he was involved in building up a lot of those,"" Lawrence Ho told CNN. But in opening City of Dreams in Macau earlier this year, Ho is trying to carve his own niche and continue to build up his own business empire. ""I think gone are the days when you can open a property and 'Bang!' you would steal significant market share from others,"" he told CNN. ""Before we opened we were, like the rest of the world, a little bit wary of the timing, but I think in hindsight the world economies are doing a lot better and Macau has seen its first year-on-year increase in July and August was a booming month. So I think all in all we couldn't be happier."" Ho's company, Melco-Crown Entertainment, is independent from his father's huge portfolio of businesses and the multibillion dollar City of Dreams project is a partnership with Australian James Packer, himself the son of a media tycoon. Ho is respectful of his ailing father's achievements and the advantages that the family name has given him, but also the desire it fostered to forge his own success. ""The bigger the shadow the more we can feel the underdog syndrome. ... being his son opened many doors, but at the same time I grew up in a very big family with our own issues, but all in all certainly being his son has helped a great deal,"" he said. There are no worries about interference from the mainland -- ""I suspect that China definitely wants [Macau and Hong Kong] to do well"" -- and Ho remains positive that Asia will see the quickest recovery from the downturn. ""A lot of the Asian countries and economies have handled the [economic] crisis this time a lot better than the Asian financial crisis 10 years ago,"" he said. ""So I think, all in all, Asia has managed to come out of this much quicker than the rest of the world. And really when people are feeling better they travel and they spend more, and you know we are in the business of providing leisure and entertainment.""","Son of Stanley Ho, business tycoon who built up former-Portuguese colony of Macau .

"New York (CNN) -- The teen who mysteriously turned up in New York with apparent amnesia emptied her bank account and left behind ""everything"" before she left her home in Washington, police told CNN. The woman, now identified as Kacie Aleece Peterson, 18, of Hansville, Washington, withdrew about $400 from her Bank of America account, said Scott Wilson, spokesman for the Kitsap County Sheriff's Office in Washington. But Peterson ""left everything,"" including her wallet, identification, cell phone, clothes and even her bike, which was secured outside a Wal-Mart, Wilson said. Police still do not know how Peterson traveled cross-country to New York City. The woman mysteriously turned up in Manhattan two weeks ago, claiming to have no memory of her family, her home -- or even her own name. There's no indication that she's feigning her memory loss, said Paul Browne, deputy commissioner of the New York Police Department. At the same time, because Peterson is an adult, authorities have not ruled out the theory that she left home to re-establish herself elsewhere, Wilson said. The teen's father, Henry Peterson of Colville, Washington, told Kitsap County authorities his daughter had occasional memory lapses, Wilson said. In May, Kacie Peterson was found lying on the ground next to a creek at the family farm, Wilson said. She had blacked out and did not remember who she was, he said. Kacie Peterson was briefly hospitalized after the incident, he said. Her father also told investigators that in another incident his daughter was found unconscious on her bedroom floor, Wilson said. Henry Peterson reported his daughter missing on October 2, Wilson said, after the family friend she lived with told him that the last time she saw Kacie Peterson was September 30. Kacie Peterson moved in June from eastern Washington with her father to western Washington to live with a friend of her mother, who died when she was 7, Wilson said. Henry Peterson told police he agreed to the transition, Wilson said. The teen's father described their relationship as ""difficult"" and ""that he had put too much pressure on his daughter to do well and get good grades,"" Wilson said. Kacie Peterson, a high school senior, started anew at Kingston High School in Kingston, Washington, but only attended for three weeks, said Chris Case, director of community relations for North Kitsap school district. Enrolled in the Running Start program there, Kacie Peterson had two advanced placement classes at the school and also classes at Olympic College in Poulsbo, about 10 miles away, Case said. Kingston high school officials said Kacie Peterson was quiet, shy and that ""she had no friends,"" Wilson said. The last time she showed up for class was on September 29, Case said. The next time some employees of the school saw the student she was sporting a new look. ""The school here is telling me she had long hair past her shoulders,"" Case said. In the photo New York police showed of the teen during their investigation to identify her, Kacie Peterson had hair that looked only about a couple of inches long on top and tapered low on the sides. Police asked for help identifying the teen after she was found in midtown Manhattan around 12:30 a.m. on October 9 outside the Covenant House youth shelter. The organization had said she was not a resident at the time and did not appear as if she intended to seek refuge at the facility. A security guard for the shelter noticed her walking around on the sidewalk near Covenant House and approached her. Finding her unresponsive, he called police. Officers interviewed her, but it became clear that she couldn't provide authorities with any information about herself. A photo of the then-unidentified woman aired on CNN, and a viewer in Maryland who was familiar with Kacie Peterson alerted authorities. Police established a positive identification. Police say they do not know how she lost her memory. She is still in New York and receiving care from the city agency, Browne said. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Khadijah Rentas, Erica Hill and Melanie Whitley contributed to this report.","""Jane Doe"" identified as Kacie Aleece Peterson, 18, of Hansville, Washington .

"(CNN)  -- Arsenal and Hull City were charged with failing to control their players by the English Football Association (FA) on Wednesday after their fiery Premier League match on December 19. The match at the Emirates Stadium, won 3-0 by title-chasing Arsenal, became heated just before halftime when Arsenal's Samir Nasri clashed with Hull's Richard Garcia. Stephen Hunt then had a confrontation with Nasri and a mass brawl ensued, with home goalkeeper Manuel Almunia running the length of the field to get involved. Referee Steve Bennett had to battle to get things under control and then showed yellow cards to both Hunt and Nasri. The clubs have until January 13 to launch any appeal. In other Premier League news on Wednesday, Liverpool could give Italian midfielder Alberto Aquilani his full debut for the crucial Boxing Day clash with Wolves. Aquilani, a big summer signing from AS Roma, has yet to start a league game for Liverpool, having battled to recovery from an ankle injury. Manager Rafael Benitez has been criticized for his reluctance to play Aquilani, but with the player recovering from a calf injury which kept him out of last weekend's match all the indicators are that he will take his place at Anfield. Premier League champions Manchester United have been clearance to play Senegal striker Mame Biram Diouf after he was granted a work permit. United signed Diouf from Molde in July before loaning him back to the Norwegian club. He scored 16 goals in 29 games in Norway and with Senegal failing to qualify for  the African Cup of Nations, United have pressed to get him the proper clearances.","Arsenal and Hull City face FA charge of failing to control their players in December 19 match .

"(CNN) -- In trendy neighborhoods of Tokyo customers are lining up for vitamin injections that promise to improve health and beauty. These intravenous vitamin ""drips"" are part of the latest quick-fix, health fad catching on in Japan: the IV cafe. Each drip pack contains saline solution and specific vitamins and minerals to target a particular health ailment or beauty concern. ""I used to take vitamin supplements, but changed to the IV drip because I feel the effects more quickly,"" a 20-something woman at the Tenteki 10 Café told CNN. She said she receives specific injections to get better skin, burn fat and boost her energy. There are 10 different varieties to choose from at Tenteki. The ""orange"" variety touts anti-aging properties, loaded with antioxidants. The ""placenta pack"" is said to help rejuvenate and ease muscle stiffness. Prices range from $20 to $30 per injection, and nurses see about 30 to 40 people each day. Their most common patients are Japanese businessmen who work in the same office building. ""I see a lot of businessmen who say they don't have time to sleep. They can't take a break from working and get the vitamin drip for an extra kick of energy,"" a Tenteki nurse told CNN. ""Blue"" is the most requested vitamin pack among these men: a concoction of B1 and vitamin E that claims to offer relief from exhaustion. Registered nurses and doctors administer the drips at Tenteki, but there's no conclusive medical evidence to back up the health claims. Many nutritionists actually caution against using injectable vitamin supplements because the quantities are not regulated. ""More is not necessarily better...some vitamins and minerals can be toxic in high doses,"" particularly the fat-soluble ones which the body stores like Vitamins A, D, E and K, explained Claire Williamson, Nutrition Scientist at the British Nutrition Foundation. In Europe and the United States vitamin shots are popular among celebrities with hectic lifestyles and little time to sleep, particularly vitamin B 12. Former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell and singer Robbie Williams have both confirmed they've used the shots as part of their diets to maintain stamina during tours. Dermatological injections of Vitamin C are also popular among women hoping to keep their skin looking young. Former supermodel Cindy Crawford has admitted using such injections to keep her skin firm and wrinkle-free. According to Williamson, it does not matter if supplements are injected into the vein or into the skin. ""At the end of the day it will go into the blood stream,"" she said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- It was the U.S. government's version of the ticker in New York's Times Square, blasting Havana's main seaside strip with anti-Cuba slogans in 5-foot high crimson letters. It symbolized the tit-for-tat diplomatic row between Washington and Havana. Cuban flags flutter in front of the U.S. interests section building in Havana in 2007. But the ticker at the top of the U.S. interests section in Cuba has gone blank, yet another signal the past half-century of animosity between the two countries is easing. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said the ticker was turned off in June because it was not considered ""effective"" as a means of delivering information to the Cuban people. The scrolling electronic sign, fitted across 25 windows of the U.S. interests section, ran quotes from American heroes, such as Martin Luther King's ""I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up,"" and Abraham Lincoln's ""No man is good enough to govern another man without that other's consent."" It also streamed news and political messages that blamed Cuba's everyday problems on the communist regime led by Fidel Castro and the island's socialist economy. The island's transportation woes, for example, were the topics of jabs such as, ""Some go around in Mercedes, some in (Russian-built) Ladas, but the system forces almost everyone to hitch rides."" The sign -- erected in 2006 by the Bush administration and billed as a way to circumvent censorship and, the administration said, offer hope and freedom to Cubans oppressed by a brutal regime -- fueled a propaganda war with Fidel Castro, who referred to the U.S. interests section as ""the headquarters of the counterrevolution."" Calling the ticker an assault on Cuba's sovereignty by an imperialist bully, an infuriated Fidel Castro marched 1 million Cubans past the interests section in protest, dug up the U.S. mission's parking lot and blocked the ticker by erecting anti-U.S. billboards and 138 huge black flags to commemorate victims of so-called U.S. aggression. He promised there would be no contact between U.S.-based diplomats in Havana and Cuba's foreign ministry until the sign came down. Fidel's brother Raul Castro, who now rules Cuba, took down the anti-U.S. billboards this year as ties between the two countries improved. In April, President Obama lifted restrictions on Cuban-Americans traveling to the island and sending remittances to relatives there. And this month, U.S. and Cuban diplomats held their first talks since 2003 on Cuban migration to the United States. The State Department's Kelly acknowledged most Cubans couldn't read the ticker because of the counter-propaganda erected by the Cubans. The ""dueling billboards,"" Kelly said, were not promoting a productive U.S.-Cuba relationship. Kelly said measures also announced by Obama in April to allow U.S. cell-phone networks and other telecommunication technology to operate on the island would do more to allow a free flow of information to the Cuban people.","Sign's deactivation comes as relations between U.S., Cuba improve .

"(CNN) -- The city of New Haven, Connecticut, will promote 14 firefighters who were involved in a workplace discrimination case that worked its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The firefighters were among the New Haven 20 -- one Hispanic and 19 white firefighters -- who fought the city after it threw out the results of a 2003 firefighter promotion exam that left too few minorities qualified for promotions. A U.S. District Court issued a judgment finding the city violated the civil rights of a group of the white firefighters when it threw out the exams in 2004, according to Jessica Mayorga, city spokeswoman. The Tuesday decision follows a court action by seven black New Haven firefighters seeking to delay the promotions. ""Yesterday, the court entered an order that provides the City of New Haven with the legal sanction necessary to move forward and promote the fourteen plaintiffs in the Ricci case entitled to promotions,"" the city said in a statement. ""As a result, we intend to do so as soon as practicable."" The firefighters will be promoted to either lieutenant or captain. Mayorga said the other six involved in the lawsuit were not eligible for promotions that were available at the time the exams were given. She said the court's order only addresses 14 of the 20 plaintiffs. If the exams had been certified in 2004, the other six plaintiffs would not have been promoted. The case was the center of attention during the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of now-Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who was on the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals that backed the city in the case. The U.S. Supreme Court eventually overturned the appeals court ruling 5-4 earlier this year when the justices ruled that the city improperly threw out the results of the promotion exams. Key plaintiff Frank Ricci and others took promotion exams in 2003 for lieutenant and captain positions that had become available in Connecticut's second-largest city. New Haven's personnel department had contracted with a private firm to design the exams. When the results came back, however, city lawyers expressed concern about the results because none of the black firefighters and only one Latino who took the exam scored high enough to be promoted. The city said that under a federal civil rights law known as Title VII, employers must ban actions such as promotion tests that would have a ""disparate impact"" on a protected class, such as a specified race or gender. The group of firefighters, claiming they were wronged by the city's action, then sued, calling themselves the ""New Haven 20.""","Firefighters fought city after it threw out the results of a promotion exam .

"(CNN) -- Floyd Mayweather Jr will have to pay Juan Manuel Marquez a reported $600,000 after weighing in two pounds too heavy ahead of Saturday night's welterweight showdown in Las Vegas. Floyd Mayweather Jr, left, faces off with Juan Manuel Marquez ahead of Saturday night's fight. Fight promoters Golden Boy confirmed after Friday's weigh-in that there had been a contractually agreed weight of 144 pounds for Mayweather's comeback bout, and that the American would pay a stipulated -- but undisclosed -- amount for every pound over that amount. As it was, Mayweather tipped the scales at 146 pounds and Mexican Marquez, whose usual weight is around 135 pounds, was weighed at 142 as he stepped up from lightweight for the fight. The maximum for a welterweight is 147 pounds. ""The fight was contracted as a welterweight fight with an agreed upon weight of 144 pounds. However, there were pre-negotiated weight penalties built in,"" Golden Boy CEO Richard Schaefer told ESPN.com. The website also reported sources who stated that each extra pound would cost Mayweather $300,000, thus giving Marquez an additional $600,000 on top of his $3.2 million guarantee for the fight at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. The 32-year-old Mayweather, who returns to the boxing ring for the first time since December 2007 when he beat Ricky Hatton to retain his WBC world welterweight championship, has a reported minimum guarantee of $10 million before pay-per-view TV revenues are added. Mayweather is undefeated with a career record of 39-0, while the 36-year-old Marquez, who holds the WBA and WBO world lightweight belts, has 50 victories from 55 fights, 37 by knockout. Meanwhile, Nikolai Valuev will defend his WBA heavyweight title against British boxer David Haye in Germany on November 7. The fight, originally announced in July, had been in doubt as American John Ruiz lodged a legal challenge claiming that he was the giant Russian's mandatory challenger. However, the 36-year-old's promoters have clinched a deal with Ruiz, meaning the bout can go ahead as planned at Nuremberg's Arena Nurnberger Versicherung, where Valuev beat Sergei Liakhovich in February 2008. The 7' 1"" Valuev, the tallest and heaviest boxing champion of all time who has a record of 50 wins from 52 fights, will dwarf the 6' 3"" Haye, the former undisputed cruiserweight champion.","Floyd Mayweather weighs in at 146 pounds, Juan Manuel Marquez at 142 .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Tehran's Revolutionary Court sentenced 11 people to death after convicting them of participating in post-election riots, state media reported Thursday. Two of the sentences have been carried out; the rest are under appeal, the Iranian Students News Agency said, quoting a court official. These are the first executions known to be related to the post-election violence that erupted across Iran in June and has continued since, Amnesty International said in a statement condemning the hangings. But a lawyer for one of the men executed on Thursday disputed a key part of the official report. ""Both of these men were arrested two months before the elections and they were in prison until their sentences were carried out. So how can someone who's in prison take part in protests?"" asked Nasrin Sotoudeh, a Tehran-based human rights lawyer who represented Arash Rahmanipour, one of two men hanged Thursday. Full coverage of the protests in Iran . His father had been scheduled to visit Rahmanipour on the day of the execution, and learned only from a TV report that his son was dead, Sotoudeh said, describing the family as ""extremely upset and shocked."" ""Arash called his home two nights ago (Tuesday night) -- two nights before the sentence was carried out, and at that point Arash had no idea that his sentence was about to be carried out,"" she said. She said the hanging violated Iranian law. ""The entire process, the investigation, the trial, the handing down of the sentence and the carrying out of the sentence, were done illegally and in secret,"" she told CNN by phone. ""Arash's family and I did not have his case file. A sentence must first be announced to the defendant and his lawyer and only then can it be carried out, but this sentence was never announced to Arash or myself."" She said he had been forced to confess. ""He told me his pregnant sister had been arrested, too,"" she said. ""In two sessions where he was interrogated, they placed his sister in front of him and told him if he wanted to see her free he had to admit to things he didn't do."" Rahmanipour's sister was later released from prison but lost the baby due to stress, Sotoudeh said. Rahmanipour, 20, was charged with being a mohareb, or enemy of God, and being a member of Anjoman-e Padeshahi-e Iran (API), a banned anti-regime monarchist group, his lawyer said. Amnesty International condemned the execution of Rahmanipour and the other man executed Thursday, Mohammad Reza Ali-Zamani. ""These men were first unfairly convicted and now they have been unjustly killed. It is not even clear they had links to this group, as their 'confessions' appear to have been made under duress,"" said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa deputy director. The court said the defendants were convicted of ""waging war against God, trying to overthrow the Islamic government"" and membership in armed and anti-revolutionary groups. Anti-government demonstrations began after the disputed June 12 presidential vote, which re-elected hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad over main opposition candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi. Late December marked the deadliest clashes in Iran since initial protests broke out in the summer. At least seven people were killed and hundreds were arrested, witnesses said, as they took to the streets on Ashura, which occurred on December 27. The Iranian government has denied that its security forces killed anyone and has blamed reformists for the violence.","Eleven rioters sentenced to death for post-election riots, according to Iranian press .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Four U.S. soldiers have been charged with cruelty and maltreatment of four subordinates in Iraq after a suicide investigation brought to light alleged wrongdoing, the military said Friday. There is no confirmed evidence that the suicide, which involved a fifth subordinate in the unit, was a result of any mistreatment, said Lt. Col. Kevin Olson, a spokesman for Multi-National Division-South, who said the military is looking into that possibility. Charges were brought Wednesday against three sergeants and a specialist with the 13th Cavalry Regiment out of Fort Bliss, Texas, accusing them of engaging in ""verbal abuse, physical punishment and ridicule of subordinates,"" according to Olson. He described the physical punishment as falling into the category of ""undue calisthenics."" ""Accusations of cruelty and maltreatment are taken very seriously, and we will investigate this isolated incident thoroughly,"" said Brig. Gen. David Elicerio, deputy commanding general for Multi-National Division-South. Olson said the Army does not believe the maltreatment of subordinates went beyond the soldiers' unit. The four were identified as: . All four soldiers have been removed from their unit. Olson said Army officials have spoken to the four subordinate soldiers and are offering them any help they need. The suicide investigation began on August 4, Olson said. On that day, a Defense Department news release said that Pvt. Keiffer P.

Al Shabaab fighters display two bodies of Somali police officers during a battle August 12 in Mogadishu. At least 27 people were wounded in the Friday night incident, when Muslim militants fired mortars toward Mogadishu's port and struck a residential area.

Al Shabaab is on the U.S. list of terror organizations because of its ties to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network.

"(CNN) -- On February 12, 2009, Christopher Savoie received an e-mail from his ex-wife that he had feared would come. Christopher Savoie is in jail in Japan after trying to get back his son, Isaac, and daughter, Rebecca. About a month after their bitter divorce, in which Noriko Savoie promised as part of the agreement she wouldn't return to Japan with their children to live, she threatened to do just that. ""It's very difficult to watch kids becoming American and losing Japanese identity,'' Noriko Savoie wrote her ex-husband in the e-mail, according to Tennessee court documents. ""I am at the edge of the cliff. I cannot hold it anymore if you keep bothering me.'' Now she is in Japan with the children. Christopher Savoie sits in a Japanese jail accused of trying to kidnap them. He practically predicted it would end this way. The couple, citizens of the United States and Japan, were married for 14 years and lived in Japan. But they came to the United States with 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca. They divorced in January 2009 after Christopher Savoie was unfaithful. Noriko Savoie was given custody of the children and agreed to remain in the United States. During the divorce, Christopher Savoie was concerned that his ex-wife would move to Japan with the children. After receiving the threatening e-mail, he went to court to try to prevent that. He pleaded with a judge in March to stop Noriko Savoie from being able to travel to Japan for summer vacation. He knew if she took the children to Japan to live the deck would be stacked against him. Japanese law would recognize Noriko Savoie as the primary custodian and he might never see his children again. Noriko Savoie told a judge the words in her e-mail were in the heat of the moment; she was angry that her ex-husband had just married the woman who caused their marriage to end. ""I was very, very -- at the peak of my frustration ..."" Noriko Savoie told a judge, according to court transcripts. ""He actually married three days before that e-mail. He remarried the person -- a woman whom he was having affair [with], so I was very depressed and -- but also angry."" Noriko Savoie was asked repeatedly in court if she would try to take the children and flee to Japan. Her answer was always no. ""I have never thought about taking children away from their father, never,"" she told the judge. Christopher Savoie didn't believe her. Their divorce had been rocky, both of them said. The court documents reveal bitter fights and mediations during the divorce. The two accused each other of sending harassing e-mails. They also fought over sending the kids to baseball, Scouts and other activities. Noriko Savoie accused him of not giving her enough money to take English language lessons or go to school so she could get a job. He accused her of not trying hard enough to enroll or find a place to live.  Dad paid ex-wife $800K in divorce » . Despite those issues, Christopher Savoie said his only concern was making sure he wouldn't be separated from his children. He knew trying to get the kids back would be ""a futile effort"" if Noriko Savoie did flee with the children, according to court documents. He laid out in court a scenario similar to what he is facing. ""If she were to go to Japan with the children and with primary custodial rights, there's pretty much no doubt that I would have a very difficult time enforcing my rights to visitation should Noriko decide not to let the children see me,"" he said. He said he'd have a hard time paying expensive legal fees because most of his money was tied up in his house, car and 401(k) after he gave Noriko Savoie more than $700,000 as part of the divorce settlement. With that money, he feared she'd be able to move and hide the children from him. When appointed parental coordinators asked her if she planned to take the children to Japan, she hesitated and simply answered ""I think the kids will be happy if I'm happy."" The judge asked Noriko Savoie rhetorically whether she would be willing to put up money, essentially a bond, to ensure she'd return from Japan. She agreed, but was never asked to do so. Judge James G. Martin III warned Noriko Savoie she would lose her alimony, education funds and other money if she fled with the children, before ruling that he believed she wouldn't abscond with them and allowed her to travel to Japan. Noriko Savoie followed the court's rules and took the children on vacation and returned during the required time to the United States. But days later, she took the children back to Japan. The court in the United States granted Christopher Savoie full custody after Noriko Savoie fled the country. But that court order means nothing in Japan, where courts generally favor mothers in custody disputes. The couple is also still considered married in Japan, because they never divorced there, Japanese police said Wednesday. And, police said, the children are Japanese and have Japanese passports. A 1980 Hague Convention standardized laws on international child abduction, but Japan is not a party to that agreement. Christopher Savoie knew all this when he decided this week to go to Japan to get his children back. He took the children as Noriko Savoie walked them to school Monday in Yanagawa, a rural town in southern Japan. He headed for the nearest U.S. consulate, in the city of Fukuoka on the Southern island of Kyushu, to try to obtain passports for the children, screaming at the guards to let him in the compound. He was steps away from the front gate but still standing on Japanese soil when he was arrested. Christopher Savoie, who will be in jail for the next 10 days while Japanese officials sort out the situation, told CNN's Kyung Lah that he was scared and just wanted to see his children. ""I love you, Isaac, Rebecca,"" he said. ""Your daddy loves you forever. I'll be patient and strong until the day comes that I can see you both again. I am very sorry that I can't be with you."" Though he had warned everyone this was going to happen, this time he could speak in certainties. He said that though he knows it might be a tough battle, it's one he will continue to vocalize. ""I want Americans to know what's happening to me,"" Christopher Savoie said in Japanese. ""I didn't do anything wrong.""","After bitter divorce, Noriko Savoie threatened in e-mail to take kids back to Japan .

"(CNN)  -- Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson hailed his side's rollercoaster 4-3 victory over neighbors Manchester City at Old Trafford as the ""best derby of all time."" Ferguson and substitute Gary Neville celebrate Owen's late winner. Ferguson made the claim while ruing his side's sloppy defensive play which allowed City to claim three equalizing goals before Michael Owen's clinical winner deep into injury time on Sunday. ""It could have been an embarrassment, 6-0 or 7-0, if we defended our proper way,"" claimed the legendary Scot. ""We could have won by a big score but by making mistakes, which was the essence of the game, we probably were in the best derby game of all time. ""What do you choose? Win the best derby game of all time or win 6-0? I'd probably pick 6-0."" Was this the greatest derby ever? The build-up to the match had been marked by a war of words between Ferguson and City manager Mark Hughes, who has been handed a massive transfer budget by his side's Abu Dhabi owners. Ferguson had branded them ""cocky"" and did little to dampen down the rivalry with his post match comments. Blog:Should referees also keep time? ""Sometimes you have a noisy neighbor. You cannot do anything about that. They will always be noisy,"" he said. ""You just have to get on with your life, put your television on and turn it up a bit louder. ""Today the players showed their form. That is the best answer of all."" By contrast, City manager Mark Hughes was furious with referee Martin Atkinson for the amount of added time played, with Owen scoring in the 96th minute. ""We need an explanation because I don't know why the referee has added that amount of time on,"" said Hughes. ""We just feel a little bit aggrieved that they were given that time."" It was a heartbreaking finale for his team with Bellamy's magnificent second goal after a mistake by Rio Ferdinand appearing to give his up and coming side a share of the spoils. ""We're disappointed, we put in a hell of a shift today,"" said Hughes. ""Craig Bellamy scored two magnificent goals. He didn't deserve to be on the losing side,"" added Hughes. Ferguson, who has used free transfer signing Owen sparingly this season, said the England striker showed his true quality. ""His positional play, first touch and finish were absolutely superb. World class."" The victory took United to second place in the English Premier League behind pacesetting Chelsea with City suffering their first defeat of the season.","Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson hails 'best derby of all time'

"(CNN) -- I think it's fair to say that most of us have been absolutely horrified by the plight of tens of thousands of Haitians this month. A massive earthquake is always devastating, but for such carnage and misery to be wrought upon a people who already had nothing seems especially cruel. It was 0100 GMT when I went on air, the aftershocks were both frequent and significant, and from the Tweets I read there was a sense of utter panic and fear on the streets. The pictures have been absolutely heartbreaking, and the stories our crews have reported from all over the country have been terribly moving. I wanted to do something to help. For some reason I was especially moved when Anderson Cooper dragged that bleeding boy out of the street - a young boy who was stunned and panicked and terribly vulnerable - and I realized that I had something I could contribute. Click here to place a bid on the Open flag . (Item number: 250569560734) Years ago, when I was the Living Golf anchor, I was looking to collect something unusual for a charity auction. As it happens, the auction was cancelled and since then I had largely forgotten that I had something of value and unique at the back of my wardrobe. The British Open, one of golf's most illustrious competitions, is never more special than when held at St Andrews, the so-called ""home of golf."" Every professional wants to be ""Open Champion"" and of the last seven tournaments to be played up there, many of the champions have been legends of the sport. Jack Nicklaus won it twice, as did Tiger Woods. Seve Ballesteros and Nick Faldo complete the roll-call of champions who have already made it into the pantheon of greats. It struck me that to get all four to autograph a replica flag from the 2005 Open would be pretty special. Seve (1984 winner) obliged me in Tenerife later that year, with a signature as flamboyant as many of his shots. Tiger (2000 and 2005 winner) added his name when we met in Dubai the next year. Faldo (1990 winner) and I live in the same town but our paths never seemed to cross when they needed to and so I posted the flag to his management company and from somewhere on his global travels he obliged. My colleague Justin Armsden interviewed Nicklaus (1970 and 1978 winner) at The Old Course and, though Jack hadn't bargained on signing any autographs that day, Justin's producer Andrea Mortensen bagged the all important tag. So, just to recap, some of the greatest names in golf have signed this unique memento.  Also up for auction are the Xeroxed scorecards of all four players when they last all played the St Andrews Open in 2000. They are perfectly reproduced. You'll see Tiger's winning round, counter-signed by another Open Champion David Duval and another card is counter-signed by a man who wasn't yet a major winner, Angel Cabrera. You'll note the meticulous nature of Faldo's game, every hole is neatly ticked off and appropriately, there's even a squiggle and a correction on the card of American John Daly, the only Open champion at St Andrews since 1970 that I was unable to persuade to sign the flag. But maybe his autograph absence and messy scorecard are in keeping with the erratic character we have come to know and love! This year just so happens to be the 150th anniversary of The Open at St Andrews and so it's appropriate to auction the flag and the cards in 2010. But Haiti is the true motivation for the sale. It is right because they desperately need help. All proceeds of the sale will go to a charity called Plan International, who have been working in Haiti for over thirty years. The donation will support their emergency relief and recovery work there with children and their communities; helping the most vulnerable and the very people who are the country's future. I hope you will bid on the flag, and if not please help spread the word of the sale so that we can get a really good price for it. It deserves a good home, and the auction will help ensure a brighter future for many children in their darkest hour.","CNN's Don Riddell persuaded the greats of golf to sign a replica flag from the St. Andrews British Open of 2005 .

"(OPRAH.com) -- Four years ago, when Oprah managed to get down to a trim and fit 160 pounds, she thought she'd hit on a foolproof formula for permanent weight loss. Then life --in the form of a thyroid problem and a killer schedule-- intervened. Last year she was back up to the 200-pound mark and knew something had to change. After a desperately needed time-out to reflect and recharge, here's what she's learned, what she's doing differently, and what's next. Oprah Winfrey attends a gala on December 3, 2008 in New York City. You know how bad you feel when you have a special event, a reunion, a wedding, a bar mitzvah, and you wanted to lose that extra 10 to 40 pounds, and you didn't do it? So the day comes and now you've got to try to find something to wear that makes you feel halfway decent, and you have to figure out how to hold in your stomach all night and walk backward out of the room so no one sees that your butt keeps moving even when you stop. Multiply that feeling by a million -- make that more than 2.4 million for every O reader -- and you'll know how I've felt over the past year every time I had to shoot a cover for O. If you're a regular subscriber, you'll notice you've not seen a head-to-toe shot all year. Why? Because I didn't want to be seen. "" In 1992 I reached my heaviest, 237 pounds. I was 38. Then, four years ago, I made it a goal to lose weight, and I appeared on the January 2005 cover at a toned 160 pounds. I thought I was finished with the weight battle. I was done. I'd conquered it. I was so sure, I was even cocky. I had the nerve to say to friends who were struggling, ""All you have to do is work out harder and eat less! Get your 10,000 steps in! None of that starchy stuff!"" Bam! Karma is a bear of a thing. So here I stand, 40 pounds heavier than I was in 2006. (Yes, you're adding correctly; that means the dreaded 2-0-0.) I'm mad at myself. I'm embarrassed. I can't believe that after all these years, all the things I know how to do, I'm still talking about my weight. I look at my thinner self and think, ""How did I let this happen again?"" Oprah.com: How to prevent weight gain relapse . It happened slowly. In February 2007, at 53, I started to have some health issues. At first I was unable to sleep for days. My legs started swelling. My weight started creeping up, first 5 pounds, then 10 pounds. I was lethargic and irritable. My internal clock seemed totally out of whack. I began having rushing heart palpitations every time I worked out. Okay, I've never loved daily exercise, but this was different. I actually developed a fear of working out. I was scared that I would pass out. Or worse. I felt as if I didn't know my own body anymore. After many trips to various doctors, I received a diagnosis. I had hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid that can speed up metabolism and cause weight loss -- but of course didn't make me lose a single pound) and then gradually started moving into hypothyroidism (a sluggish metabolism that can cause fatigue and weight gain). My doctor prescribed medication and warned me that I must ""learn to embrace hunger"" or I would immediately gain weight. Believe me, no part of me was prepared to embrace hunger. It seemed as if the struggle I'd had with weight my entire adult life was now officially over. I felt completely defeated. I thought, ""I give up. I give up. Fat wins."" All these years I'd had only myself to blame for lack of willpower. Now I had an official, documented excuse. The thyroid diagnosis felt like some kind of prison sentence. I was so frustrated that I started eating whatever I wanted -- and that's never good. My drug of choice is food. I use food for the same reasons an addict uses drugs: to comfort, to soothe, to ease stress. I switched doctors and still gained weight. At one point I was on three medications: one for heart palpitations, another for high blood pressure, another to moderate my thyroid. Who knew this tiny butterfly gland at the base of the throat had so much power? When it's off, your whole body feels the effects. I followed my doctor's orders to the letter (except for the part about working out). I took the prescribed medication religiously at the same time each day. Oprah.com: The truth about your thyroid . Being medicated, though necessary, made me feel as if I were viewing life through a veil. I felt like an invalid. Everything was duller. I felt like the volume on life got turned down. I realized this to some extent, but I wasn't fully aware of the effect of the medication until I had a conversation with my friend Bob Greene. He'd given up lecturing me about working out and eating well, but we were walking together one day and he said, ""I think something's wrong. You're listless. Your movements are slower, even when you're just doing normal stuff. Twice I've told you something and you don't remember it. There's no sparkle in your eyes. I think you're in some sort of depression.""  Greene talks about Oprah's struggle » . Me -- depressed? I hadn't thought I was, but definitely something was off. I felt like the life force was being sucked out of me. I always had an excuse for being tired. It took extra effort to do everything. I didn't want to go anywhere, and I didn't want to be seen any more than I had to. I could oversee a show and a magazine that tell people how to live their best lives, but I definitely wasn't setting an example. I was talking the talk, but I wasn't walking the walk. And that was very disappointing to me. Immediately after that conversation with Bob, I called my doctor. ""All this medicine is making my life feel like a flat line,"" I said. So my doctor slowly weaned me off it, except for one aspirin a day. (By the way, never suddenly stop taking prescribed medication, especially heart and blood pressure medication, without checking with your physician.)

"(CNN) -- There's something lurking in the depths of Loch Ness, Scotland and it has nothing to do with monsters. Footage from the Loch Ness submarine search showing two golf balls submerged in silt. On a recent expedition to try and find evidence of the Loch Ness monster, U.S. research teams came across something quite unexpected -- not a prehistoric creature of the deep but thousands of plastic covered golf balls. Mike O'Brien of SeaTrepid explains: ""At first we thought they were mushrooms, there were so many. But when we lowered the camera, we were surprised to see that they were in fact, golf balls."" The smattering of balls were found roughly 300 yards from the beach and 100 yards from the shore where it is thought locals and visitors have been using the loch to practice their driving skills for quite some time. One witness, conservationist Adrian Shine, told CNN he had seen locals launching balls almost 300 feet into the waters.  Watch a video of balls being found at the bottom of Loch Ness. » . However, Shine doesn't believe this to be an environmental threat: ""Certainly it's undesirable, but I don't think it will have a significant environmental impact on the loch."" It seems missing and discarded golf balls may not be bad news for all concerned. David Roston has built a career out of wading through rivers and diving in lakes to collect and re-sell discarded golf balls. His online company www.lakeballs.co.uk have been retailing ""lake balls"" for almost 10 years, but even his powers of retrieval would be challenged by the monstrous task of recovering balls from the bottom of the loch. ""I've dived in various lakes and found 10 to 15 thousand golf balls at a time, it's incredible -- but we've never attempted to clear a loch!"" Bobbing along at a depth of 754 feet, it is unlikely these balls of Loch Ness will ever see the light of day again.

"(CNN)  -- American Lindsey Vonn suffered a pre-Olympic scare after taking a crashing fall in the World Cup giant slalom in Lienz on Monday. Vonn, who is a medal favorite in several disciplines for February's Winter Games in Vancouver, damaged her left arm after sliding out on the first run, losing her balance on a bump after a sharp left turn before thumping into a gate. She received lengthy medical treatment on the slope with initial fears that she had broken the arm. But scans at a local hospital showed only severe bruising and the 25-year-old may even compete in Tuesday's slalom at the same venue, U.S. team medical director Richard Quincy told reporters. Vonn's arm has been placed in a splint to speed recovery and she was said to have been in considerable pain. ""Hurting my arm is way better than hurting one of my legs,"" Vonn was quoted on her personal Web site www.lindseyvonn.com. Her crash overshadowed a fine victory for Kathrin Hoelzl of Germany, who led after the first run and posted a combined time of  two minutes, 16.61 seconds with Manuela Moelgg of Italy just 0.05 seconds back in second. Taina Barioz of France occupied the final podium position. Vonn retains her lead in the overall standings with 581 points ahead of second-placed Maria Reisch, who appeared distracted by her friend's crash and also skied out first time down. The German is 50 points adrift as Vonn looks to defend her overall crown. Vonn suffered an unusual injury setback at the world championships in Val d'Isere, France earlier this year. Celebrating a medal success, she sliced her thumb open on a champagne bottle and competed for the rest of the season with heavy strapping. Vonn's appearance in Vancouver is being heavily plugged by sponsors and television rights holders, but she is still seeking her first Olympic medal after missing out in Salt Lake City and Turin. Austria's Kathrin Zettel, who led the GS standings going into the race but was overtaken by Hoelzl, was 0.95 seconds behind the German after skiing off-course in her first run and finished fifth. Hoelzl takes the lead in the giant slalom discipline standings, leapfrogging Kathrin Zettel of Austria, who finished fifth.","World Cup overall leader Lindsey Vonn crashes out of giant slalom in Lienz .

"(CNN) -- Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman Loera, a 54-year-old drug cartel leader whose nickname means ""Shorty,"" is the most wanted man in Mexico. He's also one of the most wanted men in the United States. Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman Loera leads the Sinaloa cartel, which is battling for turf along the border. For five years, the State Department has kept a $5 million bounty on his head, calling Guzman a threat to U.S. security. Guzman, who leads the Sinaloa cartel, is a key player in the bloody turf battles being fought along the border. He recently upped the stakes, ordering his associates to use lethal force to protect their loads in contested drug trafficking corridors, according to the Los Angeles Times. The cartel's tentacles and those of its chief rival, the Gulf cartel, already reach across the border and into metropolitan areas such as Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Seattle, Washington; St. Louis, Missouri; and Charlotte, North Carolina, Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Joseph Arabit told a subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee in March. ""No other country in the world has a greater impact on the drug situation in the United States than Mexico does,"" said Arabit, who heads the DEA's office in this year's border hot spot, El Paso, Texas. See where Mexican cartels are in the U.S. A December 2008 report by the Justice Department's National Drug Intelligence Center revealed that Mexican drug traffickers can be found in more than 230 U.S. cities. So far, the U.S. has largely been spared the violence seen in Mexico, where the cartels' running gunbattles with police, the military and each other claimed about 6,500 lives last year. It was a sharp spike from the 2,600 deaths attributed to cartel violence in 2007. Once again, drug war casualties are mounting on the Mexican side at a record pace in 2009 -- more than 1,000 during the first three months of the year, Arabit said.  See who the key players are » . The violence that has spilled over into the U.S. has been restricted to the players in the drug trade -- trafficker-on-trafficker, DEA agents say. But law enforcement officials and analysts who spoke with CNN agree that it is only a matter of time before innocent people on the U.S. side get caught in the cartel crossfire. ""It's coming. I guarantee, it's coming,"" said Michael Sanders, a DEA spokesman in Washington. Sinaloa cartel leader Guzman's shoot-to-kill instructions aren't limited to Mexican authorities and cartel rivals; they also include U.S. law enforcement officials, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing sources and intelligence memos. The move is seen as dangerously brazen, the newspaper reported. In the past, the cartels have tried to avoid direct confrontation with U.S. law enforcement. U.S. officials are trying to stop the violence from crossing the border. The Obama administration committed to spending an additional $700 million to help Mexico fight the cartels and agreed to double the number of U.S. agents working the border. But $700 million pales in comparison with the wealth amassed by just one target. Guzman, who started in collections and rose to lead his own cartel, is said to be worth $1 billion after more than two decades in the drug trade. He made this year's Forbes list of the richest of the rich, landing between a Swiss tycoon and an heir to the Campbell's Soup fortune. Popular Mexican songs, called narcocorridos, embellish the myth of the poorly educated but charismatic cartel leader. ""Shorty is the Pablo Escobar of Mexico,"" said security consultant Scott Stewart, invoking the memory of the colorful Medellin cartel leader who also landed on the Forbes list and thumbed his nose at Colombian authorities until he died in a shower of police bullets in December 1993. Stewart, a former agent for the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, gathers intelligence on the cartels for Stratfor, a Texas-based security consulting firm that helped document Guzman's worth. Just a decade ago, Mexican smugglers worked as mules for Colombians, moving their cocaine by land across the U.S. border when the heat was on in the Caribbean. But Colombian President Alvaro Uribe's campaign of arrests and extraditions made ghosts of the Medellin and Cali cartels. The mules stepped into the power vacuum and never looked back. Now they buy cocaine from the Colombians and take their own profits. Mexican cartels now bring in about 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States, according to the DEA. Mexico also is the top foreign supplier of marijuana and methamphetamine. Marijuana became the cartels' biggest revenue source for the first time in 2007, bringing in $8.5 billion. Cocaine came in second, at $3.9 billion, and methamphetamine earned $1 billion, a top U.S. drug policymaker told a group of U.S. and Mexican law enforcement officials last year.  Watch how marijuana became the cartels' top cash crop » . The Mexican government recognizes seven cartels, but the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels are the major players along the U.S. border, according to the DEA agents, local police officials and security analysts who spoke with CNN. The cartels' enforcers -- Los Negros for Sinaloa, Los Zetas for Gulf -- are believed to be responsible for most of the violence. The status and alliances of the players continue to shift. Although the DEA and some analysts disagree, others say the Zetas, a paramilitary group of turncoat soldiers and anti-narcotics police, are now running the Gulf cartel. ""From what we've seen, the Zetas have taken over the Gulf cartel,"" analyst Stewart said. ""In violent times, soldiers tend to rise to the top."" These soldiers are incredibly well-armed, police learned after a November raid that resulted in the arrest of top Zeta lieutenant Jaime ""Hummer"" Gonzalez Duran. It was the largest weapons seizure in Mexican history -- 540 rifles, including AK-47s; 287 grenades; two rocket launchers; and 500,000 rounds of ammunition. At the very least, the Zeta enforcers now have a seat at the table. The DEA's Arabit testified that the Gulf cartel is now run by a triumvirate. Included is Los Zetas leader Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano, a former military man who is also known as ""El Lazco,"" or ""The Executioner."" The past year witnessed unprecedented bloodshed as the two cartels battled for control of the border's lucrative drug-trafficking corridors. The cartels are fighting over control of Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas; Sonora Nogales, across from Nogales, Arizona; and Tijuana, across the border from San Diego, California. Two years ago, the turf battle was over Nuevo Laredo, across the border from Laredo, Texas. It's all about the highways that help move the drugs. Nuevo Laredo is close to the Interstate 35 corridor, and Juarez has easy access to I-10, a major east-west interstate, and I-25, which runs north to Denver, Colorado. Tijuana is also conveniently near I-10 and I-5, which heads north all the way to the Canadian border. Some of the battles are internal, Arabit said. Some are with other cartels. And some, he said, can be attributed to the cartels' ""desperate"" attempt to resist Mexican President Felipe Calderon's unprecedented attack on drug traffickers. As soon as he took office in January 2007, Calderon called out the cartels. He has deployed about 30,000 troops to back up and, in some cases, do the job of local police. Mexico also has extradited about 190 cartel suspects to the United States since Calderon took office. The violence involves beheadings, running gunbattles and discoveries of mass graves and huge arms caches. Police and public officials have been gunned down in broad daylight. The cartels' enforcers boldly display recruitment banners in the streets. ""The beheadings started at the same time the beheading videos started coming out of Iraq,"" analyst Stewart said. ""It was simple machismo. The Sinaloa guys started putting up videos on YouTube of them torturing Zetas."" When Mexicans first stepped into the role of Colombians in the mid-1990s, the Juarez and Tijuana cartels were dominant, beneficiaries of their location. Today, they are shadows of their former selves, weakened by the deaths and arrests of their leaders. Juarez cartel leader Amado Carrillo Fuentes died of complications from plastic surgery in 1997. Known as ""The King of the Skies"" for his fleet of cocaine-carrying planes, he was said to be undergoing liposuction and other appearance-altering procedures to avoid arrest. Three of his doctors were charged with killing the cartel leader with an overdose of anesthetic during his surgery. Two of them later were killed. His death, along with the 2003 arrest of Gulf cartel founder Osiel Cardenas Guillen, set the stage for the ongoing turf battle. When Cardenas was extradited in 2007, Guzman set his sights on controlling Juarez  as well as Nogales. Cardenas is awaiting trial in October in federal court in Houston, Texas, where he is accused of drug trafficking and attempting to kill two federal agents and an informant on the streets of Matamoros, Mexico. Arrests and extraditions crippled the Arellano-Felix Organization in Tijuana, and last year, Guzman made a move on that plaza as well. ""Right now, they are fighting to survive much like Pablo Escobar,"" said the DEA's Elizabeth Kempshall, who heads the agency's office in Phoenix, Arizona. Phoenix has become the nation's kidnapping capital, largely because of the cartels' increasing presence. Kempshall said that cartel leaders fear nothing more than extradition: ""That is the worst thing for any cartel leader, to face justice in the United States."" CNN's Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this story .","Sinaloa, Gulf cartels battle for control of drug routes across U.S. border .

"(CNN) -- Justine Henin booked her place in the third round of the Australian Open after she claimed a 7-5 7-6 (8-6) victory over fifth seed Elena Dementieva in Melbourne on Wednesday. The Belgian, who won the tournament in 2004, came through an enthralling clash which lasted two hours 50 minutes at the Rod Laver Arena. Henin, who is playing in her first Grand Slam event since she ended her 20-month retirement from tennis, took the first set but Russian Dementieva hit back in an enthralling second set to take a 4-2 advantage. Wildcard Henin then broke back to take the next three games and the match went to tie-break but Dementieva was unable to take the match into a third set as Henin clinched victory with a fierce volley. After the match Henin admitted it was exactly the kind of match which vindicated her decision to return to competitive tennis. ""It's great feeling. It's magical to win this kind of match in this kind of atmosphere,"" Henin told reporters in the post-match press conference. ""It was a great match. It was very emotional for me on the court at the end because there was so much intensity. To play this kind of match in the second round, for me, after two years off in a Grand Slam, it's just the kind of situation that I needed, . ""The crowd gave me so much. So respectful at the end.

"(CNN) -- Why leave home when you can send out a sexy, stylish robot version of yourself to do anything you tell it? In ""Surrogates,"" lifelike robots take the place of humans in day-to-day life. That's the world of ""Surrogates,"" a film starring Bruce Willis that opens Friday. Willis plays an FBI agent who investigates the first murder to occur in years in a world where no one worries about crime or pain, because their robots self-heal with a quick reboot. Far-fetched science fiction? Sure. But scientists and the movie's makers say the technology might not be as far away as most people think. Armies use remote-controlled robots to attack enemies and destroy land mines. Emerging technology for the disabled allows users to operate robotic limbs and control computer cursors without touching a keyboard. And emerging ""telepresence"" technology is letting people see, hear and, increasingly, walk, talk and gesture using human-sized robots a world away. ""There are a lot of real-world components to this,"" said robotics expert and author Daniel H. Wilson, whose books like ""Where's My Jet Pack?"" and ""How to Survive a Robot Uprising"" explore the intersections between science fiction and real science. ""Clearly, there are not fully functional humanoid robots ... but there are a lot of components to telepresence that already exist."" ""Surrogates"" director Jonathan Mostow, whose film credits include 2003's ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines,"" said he was drawn to the concept of surrogate robots as an extension of current technology. And, he said, as he met with scientists, he became convinced that something approaching the concept could one day be a reality. ""To me, it's not even a question of the technology. Technology always catches up,"" he said. ""The question is, is some universal human urge being met by this invention? It seems to me we have a fundamental human desire to be lazy, to sort of not have to do things in person and to do it remotely. ""That began with the telegraph and the telephone and has morphed into the Internet."" The first steps down the road are being taken at Anybots, a Mountain View, California, company founded in 2001 by Trevor Blackwell. The company offers, for about $30,000, a 5-foot-tall, 35-pound robot that allows the user to remotely travel, see, hear and talk. It hopes to release its latest version of the robot at a more affordable price. The robot's vaguely humanoid curves, roughly adult height and ability to move around using technology similar to that of the Segway are important steps up from current teleconferencing technology, Blackwell said. Anybots in the development phase are being designed to run, jump and climb stairs, and they come equipped with fully articulated hands designed to perform increasingly human-like tasks. Blackwell said he's not sure the technology will ever advance to the level imagined in ""Surrogates"" -- but that may have as much to do with desire as ability. ""I don't know if we'll ever get quite to that level, of being that realistic,"" he said. ""Most of the time, you're not trying to fool people; you're just trying to make something human enough so people can relate to it."" Wilson, who said he appreciates ""Surrogates"" because it avoids sci-fi's traditional ""man vs. machine"" dynamic, also imagines social reasons for not pursuing such technology.

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Five people arrested after street disturbances erupted in Tehran during the recent Ashura holy day could face the death penalty, an Iranian semi-official news agency reported Thursday. The Iran Labor News Agency reported that the five will be tried for Moharebe, or waging war against God -- a charge that could be punishable by execution. ILNA attributed the information in its report to the Iranian judiciary. The case will be tried ""soon"" with defense lawyers and a prosecutor-general representative present at proceedings. ""Confessions of the accused and the investigations of the authorities"" will be considered, ILNA said. Abbas Jafari-Dolatabadi, prosecutor for the Public and Revolution Courts, had stressed that people who created disturbances on the Shiite Muslim holy day of Ashura ""by setting fire to public property and other similar crimes"" were engaging in acts ""tantamount to Moharebe,"" ILNA said.

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Nearly 90 professors at Iran's oldest and largest university signed a letter to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, criticizing the government's violent handling of student protesters. ""The issue that has left a bitter taste in the mouths of the devout Muslim and patriots of this land is the violent and above the law [illegal] encounters, particularly with University students and faculty members of this land,"" says the letter, which was posted on the reformist Web site ""Rahesabz,"" or ""Green Path."" ""In fact, the nightly attacks on the dormitories and living quarters of innocent students and daily assaults on them ... are not testaments to the power of the system, just as the violent beatings and imprisonments are not testament to its faith and piety."" The professors ask Khamenei to order revolutionary guards, government-sanctioned militiamen and others who have engaged in campus violence to vacate the university. The letter also calls for official apologies for beatings of university members and the unconditional release of detained students and faculty. There was no immediate government response to the letter. The 88 professors -- all of whom are considered employees of the Islamic republic -- who signed the letter are ""risking their jobs and God knows what else,"" said Ali Alfoneh, a research fellow at the Washington-based American Enterprise Institute who has researched the relationship between Iranian civilians and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard. ""Some of them may end up arrested,"" he added. The letter, posted on a reformist Web site Monday, is a rare and significant showing of discontent among Tehran University's academics. Student unrest has only increased since thousands of protesters turned out on the streets of Iran to oppose the country's disputed presidential election, in which hardline incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the overwhelming winner. ""Unfortunately and sadly; all of this takes place under the veil of safeguarding Islam and the representation of the supreme leadership and, even more sadly, no institution or organization accepts responsibility for this savagery!"" The anti-government demonstrations began following the disputed June 12 presidential vote, which re-elected hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad over main opposition candidate Mir Hossein Moussavi. Last month marked the deadliest clashes since the initial protests broke out this summer. At least seven people were killed and hundreds arrested as they took to the streets on Ashura, a Shiite Muslim holy day. One university researcher told CNN he was one of many beaten by police, struck with a baton 11 times. Iranian Interior Minister Mostafa-Mohammad Najjar warned Saturday that the government will not show leniency to protesters in the future. ""It doesn't surprise me that professors wrote this letter, because universities have been one of the first victims of increased government pressure,"" Alfoneh said. In the aftermath of the election, Tehran University and other institutions quickly became hotbeds of violence, with members of the government's Basij militia attacking young protesters on campus, including dormitories. In August, Khamenei addressed a group of university professors from all over, noting that academics would be held to a higher standard of accountability -- especially after the elections. ""Naturally, the expectations that we have of the professors and faculty is much greater than what we expect from the students,"" Khamenei was quoted by Iranian media as saying on August 30. ""The students are the young officers on the front lines of this war and the professors are the commanders [against] this 'soft war' -- the professors who can fulfill this role will be worthy of the Islamic republic."" The Iranian government has denied that its security forces killed anyone and has blamed reformists for the violence. At times, video has shown protesters apparently turning on security forces. Still, the letter serves as another blow to Iran's Islamic leadership, which reformists say has lost credibility in its handling of the post-election unrest. Several critics, including cleric and former presidential candidate Mehdi Karrubi have compared the tactics of the current government to those of the Shah of Iran, who was overthrown by the same fervent followers of Islam more than 30 years ago. Alfoneh noted that numerous petitions were drafted and published in the days leading up to the overthrow of the Shah, who was also slammed with allegations of injustice and human rights violations under his watch. He said it's no surprise that academics today are taking a similar approach as it becomes increasingly harder to teach amid the violence. ""The opposition and even ordinary citizen are trying to duplicate the events of 30 years ago -- they're trying to play to the memory of the public,"" Alfoneh said. CNN's Samira Simone contributed to this report.","Nearly 90 Tehran professors sign letter to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .

"(Real Simple) -- Visit a bathroom in a home in the Netherlands and you might find a good idea staring you in the face: a list of birthdays important to your host posted opposite the toilet. Why in that spot? To assure that it's viewed regularly. While you may not want to sacrifice your bathroom aesthetics for the sake of remembering key birthdays, the more often you see the dates, the more likely it is you'll remember them. As founder and ""Exalted Queen Mother"" of the Red Hat Society, an international network of women over 50, Sue Ellen Cooper chooses to keep her long list of reminders in the kitchen. ""I have a list of every significant birthday taped to the inside of my pantry door,"" she says. ""It's impossible not to see those dates every time I open the pantry."" Whether it's inside a cabinet, on the refrigerator, or bookmarking a page in the novel you're reading, place your list in a spot where you are likely to view it every day and you'll always be aware of an impending birthday. Real Simple: How to handle a milestone birthday . Use a perpetual calendar to remember birthdays . Traditional calendars are less than ideal for keeping track of birthdays, as they require you to pencil in all your important dates each year. A perpetual calendar solves that problem by charting the months without naming the day of the week for each date. Find 5-by-14-inch calendars for $10 at www.galison.com. You can also download a printable perpetual birthday-reminder calendar (for free) at Hallmark.com, or use the Real Simple: Birthday reminder worksheet. Similar to a perpetual calendar but used exclusively for birthdays, a birthday book allows you to jot down birthdays without having to rewrite each date yearly. Keep it somewhere visible, though, such as on top of a coffee table or on your desk, as opposed to placing it on a bookshelf, where it may get lost amid your Steinbecks and Angelous. The 2 3/4-by-4 1/4-inch pocket birthday organizer from Fred Flare ($8) will fit in your handbag, so you can commit dates to memory as you wait for your latte. Track birthdays in your day planner . For some, a day planner or a Filofax is preferable to a wall calendar because it's portable. Erica Ecker, a.k.a. ""The Specialist,"" is a New York City-based organizational specialist who recommends writing birthdays in a day planner with a colored marker. ""Pick a unique color,"" she says, ""so that when you go to rewrite the dates for the next year, the birthdays stand out."" Ecker also inserts mini Post-it notes as ""birthday alarms."" Insert one in the planner a few days ahead of the first birthday for which you would like to send a card. This way, you'll get the card in the mail on time. Once you've done that, move the Post-it ahead in the book to a few days before the next important birthday. If rewriting birthdays feels like too much of a chore, jot down birthdays on the tabbed section dividers before each month in your day planner. Then you can simply pull out the dividers the following year and place them before each month in your new planner. Real Simple: Look great in your birthday photos .

"MUMBAI, India (CNN) -- Shweta Gupta knows exactly what kind of groom she wants: he should be educated, well settled and live in a good location --- one that must be in India. Indian brides and grooms from the Adivasi tribe take part in a mass marriage ceremony. Love may be recession proof in India, but arranged marriages are not. One of the casualties of the global economic slowdown is the Non Resident Indian (NRI) groom. They were once considered premium marriage material. After all, these were the men who had typically studied hard, gotten top jobs in the West, earned big bucks and could whisk their wives away to better opportunities in the West. Not anymore. ""Yeah, I hate to say it but the NRI man seems to be out of favor with the Indian woman,"" said Gaurav Rakshit of Shaadi.com, a matrimonial search engine used by 14 million people globally. He has seen demand for NRI grooms drop by around 20 to 30 percent since the recession hit. Why? Shweta Gupta, a 23-year-old student, has an answer. ""Many Indians working abroad have come back due to recession hitting foreign countries and I don't think recession has affected India that much,"" said said. She believes there is greater job security in India, so would prefer her husband to be based here. Her mother, who is involved in finding a suitable man for her daughter, agreed. ""Suppose there is no job security, then again he would have to come to India, then again he would have to find a job for himself, so I would prefer both of them to be here. Plus, I want my daughter to be close to me,"" said Shraddha Gupta. Arranged marriages are still the norm in India and parents play an active role in choosing a life partner for their children. Traditionally, parents will let friends know that they are on the lookout for a partner for their child. Sometimes, they go to a marriage broker -- a middleman who keeps a stash of resumes and photos of eligible men and women whose families have registered with them. As Indians get more tech savvy, more people are taking their search for partners online. Matrimonial Web sites are popular since they offer a much bigger pool of potential life partners. Shweta Gupta is currently pursuing an MBA in Mumbai and is confident of getting good job offers in India --- another reason she would not want to risk that by going abroad. ""As the woman finds her voice in Indian society, a part of the trend is defined by her unwillingness to compromise on where she grew up, the kind of person she wants to be with, the value system she wants to associate with,"" Rakshit said. Women in India are comfortable with the opportunities they have at home and don't feel they need to go abroad to have a better life. As a result, NRI men are out. So, who is in? Well, government employees, who are typically thought to hold more stable jobs. Shaadi.com said demand was up around 45 percent since last year for men with these jobs. Also in favor now: working wives --- a departure from the tradition of Indian men choosing only homemakers. Anish Sapra, 27, has been looking for a bride for around ten months --- and he wants a working woman. ""It will be a help -- more than a help -- to have a working partner,"" he said. ""Not just for financial reasons,"" he added noting that he believes he would have more in common with such a wife. A wife with a job could help pay off some of the wedding bills, too. Indian marriages are typically large and flamboyant affairs, though the slowdown means they are somewhat subdued these days. That is one tradition Shweta Gupta won't give up. She is holding out for a grand wedding with lots of singing and dancing -- she just has to find Mr. Right. ""My marriage should be fun, it should be remembered by all people,"" she said.","Arranged marriages are still the norm in India .
Typically families sought Indians working overseas as good marriage material .
With recession hitting the West hard, Indians are looking inward for suitors .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Inauguration revelry began Sunday afternoon as thousands of people packed the National Mall in Washington for a free concert featuring big stars. Thousands gather Sunday afternoon on the National Mall in Washington. President-elect Barack Obama addressed a roaring crowd after 90 minutes of high-energy acts such as U2, Mary J. Blige, Usher and Beyonce. ""Welcome to this celebration of American renewal,"" he said. ""In the course of our history, only a handful of generations have been asked to confront challenges as serious as the ones we face right now."" ""I stand here today as hopeful as ever that the United States of America will endure,"" Obama said. ""That it will prevail; that the dream of our founders will live on in our time.""

It was nothing but good vibes -- a brief respite for an incoming president who will face huge problems after he takes office Tuesday. Bruce Springsteen opened the concert with his song ""The Rising,"" singing, ""How far I've gone/How high I've climbed/On my back's a 60 pound stone/On my shoulder a half mile line."" Along the National Mall, between the Capitol and the Washington Monument, people watched the concert on massive screens and sang along with ""America the Beautiful"" and ""This Land is Your Land."" During U2's performance of ""Pride (In the Name of Love),"" a tribute to the Rev.

Obama mentioned the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, and also referred to King's ""I Have a Dream"" speech, which took place in the same spot where he was standing. ""Directly in front of us is a pool that still reflects the dream of a King and the glory of a people who marched and bled so that their children might be judged by their character's content,"" he said. Obama said what gives him ""the greatest hope of all is not the stone and marble that surrounds us, but what fills the spaces in between. It is you -- Americans of every race and region and station who came here because you believe in what this country can be and because you want to help us get there."" Vice President-elect Joe Biden also spoke, pointing to those ""marble domes"" and towers of Washington surrounding the crowd which represent the ""majesty of a great nation -- all built stone by stone by American men and women.""

Obama will be inaugurated as the 44th president in Washington on Tuesday. A CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Sunday morning suggests most Americans see Obama's inauguration as a chance for a divided America to unify. ""You know the country is in the middle of a honeymoon when 6 in 10 Republicans have a positive view of Obama,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. CNN's John King interviewed Obama this week in Ohio. King noted that Obama will take the oath of office on the steps of a Capitol built on the backs of slaves and live in a house built on the backs of slaves. ""This has to be incredibly overwhelming,"" King said.  Watch Obama's interview with King » .

"(CNN)  -- The Wisconsin man accused of poisoning his wife with antifreeze and convicted of murdering her was sentenced Wednesday to life in prison with no chance of parole. Mark Jensen's chin quivers as a letter from his sons is read in court Wednesday before his sentencing. Mark Jensen, 48, was found guilty Thursday in Elkhorn, Wisconsin, of killing his wife, Julie Jensen, in 1998. The prosecution said the murder culminated years of torment.

She also made foreboding comments to police and to her son's teacher, saying she suspected her husband was trying to kill her.

"BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) -- When Susana Trimarco's daughter Marita Veron was 23, she vanished from their hometown in Argentina, a suspected victim of a human trafficking and prostitution ring with links throughout Latin America and Europe. Marita Veron, who is missing, hugs her daughter Micaela. Police believe Marita was forced into sexual slavery. Trimarco, 54, has spent the past 6½ years searching for her daughter, often putting herself at risk. While chasing down leads on Marita's whereabouts, she's entered dark and dangerous brothels and confronted pimps and politicians who, she says, are complicit in her daughter's disappearance. She has won accolades throughout Latin America, Europe and the United States for her work. But Marita is nowhere to be found. ""Marita is a wonderful and caring girl. My life will be completely absorbed with this fight until she is back and safe,"" Trimarco said. On April 3, 2002, Veron left her house in the northern Argentine province of Tucuman early for a doctor's appointment. She was wearing a turquoise shirt, blue jeans and old white sneakers. As she left the house, she told her mother, ""Don't worry. I'll be back soon."" Those were the last words the two exchanged. The investigation that has followed has led police and Trimarco to believe that she was kidnapped and forced into prostitution, either in rural Argentina or Spain. So far, a series of random clues has failed to provide any concrete information on Marita's whereabouts. Now, art is imitating life on Argentina's airwaves. Trimarco's story has become the basis of one of Argentina's most popular nighttime soap operas, ""Vidas Robadas,"" or ""Stolen Lives.""  Watch art imitate activism » . The program premiered in March on Telefe, one of Argentina's largest television networks, to a lukewarm response. But as the storyline and characters evolved and word started to spread, the audience grew, and it became water-cooler television. ""Stolen Lives"" attracts more than 2 million viewers nightly, a considerable feat considering Argentina's population is only 40 million. The show's plot centers on widowed anthropologist Bautista Amaya (played by Facundo Arana) and Rosario Soler (Soledad Silveyra) -- the mother of a young kidnapped girl, based on Trimarco -- who team up to unravel an underground prostitution ring. ""With every performance, I try to display the inner feelings of this woman who is suffering, to transmit her grief,"" Silveyra said. ""As an actress, I feel an enormous responsibility."" The usual telenovela themes of love, passion and revenge are ever present in ""Stolen Lives,"" but the show strives to expose an issue that has remained in the dark in Argentina until recently. Human rights groups in Argentina estimate that 800 women have gone missing at the hands of human traffickers since 2007. Worldwide, about 800,000 people are trafficked across borders annually, according to the U.S. State Department. ""I am delighted that the show has been able to bring this topic to light, because no one ever talked about human trafficking in Argentina before,"" Trimarco said. ""Stolen Lives"" is the latest in a series of recent Argentine telenovelas that dissect important social issues while also aiming to entertain. One of the most important was the 2006 hit ""Montecristo,"" which examined crimes against humanity committed by Argentina's military during the 1970s and 1980s. Local versions of ""Montecristo"" are produced in nine countries around the globe, including Turkey, Portugal, Mexico and Russia. ""With these types of telenovelas, we are able to bring something entirely new to the public debate. And because we take a fictional and not a journalistic approach, we are able to attract and keep more viewers,"" Telefe programming director Claudio Villarruel said. ""Montecristo"" helped reunite children of Argentina's Dirty War who ""disappeared"" with lost family members. The Dirty War happened from 1976-83, when the government carried out a secret campaign to purge the country of those it considered to be dissidents. ""Stolen Lives"" is making a similarly strong impact. Trimarco established a foundation in her daughter's honor, Fundacion Maria de los Angeles, last year in Tucuman. It counts U.S. Ambassador to Argentina Earl Wayne and Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner among its supporters. According to Trimarco, the foundation has rescued 360 women and children from trafficking networks, and leads on missing people continue to pour in. Argentina passed its first national law against human trafficking this year, a law that Trimarco lobbied hard to get passed. Meanwhile, praise rings from home and abroad. In May, ""Stolen Lives"" was declared a show of ""social interest"" by the Buenos Aires City legislature. In 2007, Trimarco received the U.S. State Department's ""International Women of Courage Award"" from Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice at a ceremony in Washington. Later this year, Trimarco will travel to Spain to speak about human trafficking with lawmakers from the European Union. ""It's just like Condoleezza Rice told me: My screams are being heard all over the world,"" she said. Trimarco travels around Argentina constantly, educating people about human trafficking, and following up on clues about Marita. She is also raising Marita's daughter, Micaela, 9. With all the publicity surrounding the case and the success of ""Stolen Lives,"" Trimarco has herself become a target. Her accusations of political and police involvement have led to death threats, she says. Still, she remains committed to the cause and says that collaborating with the producers of ""Stolen Lives"" to tell her story has helped give her the strength to continue searching for her daughter. ""I'm content, because my pain is now serving a purpose,"" she said.","Argentine woman vanished in 2002; it's believed she was forced into prostitution ring .

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- A team of experts gathered Friday on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula to decide how to deal with marauding bears that reportedly have killed two people recently. As many as 12,000 bears live on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula. The bears are blamed for the deaths of two guards at a geological station near a platinum mine on the peninsula in far eastern Russia. Russian media reports cite local law enforcement officials as saying the remains of the two men had been ""gnawed on."" Groups of bears have been reported in the region since the deaths, and many people have refused to work at the mine, saying they are afraid. Three hunters and a representative of Koryakgeoldobycha, employer of around 400 people at the mine, will evaluate the danger and decide whether killing a few animals is necessary, said Vladimir Rudeyev of the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry in Kamchatka. ""All decisions are made locally,"" he told CNN. ""No licenses [for shooting bears] have been issued yet. Reports came out that they were, but that's incorrect."" Hunters might need to kill only the most aggressive bears, he said. Generally, bears are timid animals and need only to be scared off. Exterminating wild bears that are not afraid of humans is relatively common in Canada and the United States. Trouble in northeastern Kamchatka began when the two unarmed geological station guards were found dead July 17. More than 93 miles (150 kilometers) away, about 20 bears came into another station several days later. Then, dozens more wild bears were seen 25 to 50 miles (40 to 80 kilometers) away, around various stations and villages in the area. ""Bears came out to where they used to live before,"" Rudeyev said. ""It constantly happens on the Kamchatka Peninsula, on various rivers, places where people work."" Humans are to blame because they attract the animals by leaving out trash or they frighten bear cubs, turning them into aggressive grown-ups, he said. Laura Williams, senior adviser for the World Wildlife Fund in Russia, also said it's the search for food that probably drives bears close to human camps. Kamchatka bears are used to feeding on salmon in the summer, but there have been fewer of the fish in local rivers this year because of overfishing, contamination or natural causes. ""When [bears] don't have salmon, they go into some of the settlements, creating bad situations both for themselves and people,"" Williams said. ""When you're in bear country, it's important to know how to act when you meet a bear."" The Kamchatka Peninsula has long been known for its brown bear population, estimated at 8,000 to 12,000. In some areas of the peninsula, the population density is the greatest in the world. Human deaths from bears are rare, and Williams said it would be an overstatement to say the situation this year is out of hand. CNN's Mike Sefanov contributed to this report.","Two guards killed July 17 near platinum mine, apparently by bears .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The 2009 presidential inauguration is looking to be historic and, frankly, headache-inducing for the throngs of people descending on the nation's capital to watch Barack Obama sworn in as the 44th president. Workers are putting the finishing touches on the innaugural stage on the steps of U.S. Capitol. CNN has compiled a list of frequently asked questions and answers. Q: How crowded will Washington be, and how will I get around? A: Think Times Square on New Year's Eve. Throw in tight security, then multiply that by 12. At least, that's how it will most likely feel. Nearly 2 million people are expected to hit the streets of the nation's capital January 20. Police will be shutting bridges across the Potomac River into Washington, along with a huge chunk of the downtown area. Two of the major routes coming into the city -- Interstates 395 and 66 -- will be closed to inbound traffic, at least for private vehicles. And for those coming from Virginia, all of the bridges between the state and Washington are going to be shut.

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Hurricane Omar became a major Category 3 storm Wednesday night as it barreled toward the Virgin and Leeward Islands in the West Indies, the National Hurricane Center said. A man watches waves crash into the shore Tuesday at Club Nautico in Falcon state, Venezuela. Omar is expected to continue gathering strength as it passes east of the Virgin Islands in the next few hours and makes its way to the northern Leeward Islands Thursday morning, the hurricane center said. At 11 p.m., Omar was moving northeast at about 20 mph with maximum sustained winds of 115 mph. The hurricane's center was about 30 miles (45 km) southwest of St. Croix and about 105 miles (165 km) southwest of St. Martin. A hurricane warning --meaning winds of 74 mph and higher are expected within a day -- is in effect for the U.S. Virgin Islands, the islands of Vieques, Culebra, St. Martin, Saba, St. Eustatius, St. Barthelemy, the British Virgin Islands and Anguilla.  See where Omar is headed » . Puerto Rico is under a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch, as are St. Kitts and Nevis, the hurricane center said. As Omar approached, Hovensa, a 500,000-barrel-a-day oil refinery on St. Croix, began shutting down all processing and auxiliary equipment ""except those necessary to maintain power supply in the complex,"" refinery spokesman Alex Moorhead said in a statement.  Watch Venezuelans try to save homes, dogs » . The move was to ensure the safety of employees and the operation of the refinery, which is jointly owned by Hess Corp. and Venezuela's state oil company. The U.S. Coast Guard closed the Christiansted Harbor, where the refinery is located, on Tuesday, and it will remain closed until the order is lifted, Moorhead said. ""Once Hurricane Omar has passed, we will conduct an inspection of our facilities as soon as it is safe to do so. If no damage is found that would impact safe operation of the refinery, the start-up of processing units will begin in sequential order,"" Moorhead said. Puerto Rico and some portions of the northern Leeward Islands, which includes the Virgin Islands, could get up to 20 inches of rain, according to the forecast. ""These rains could produce life-threatening flash floods and mudslides,"" the hurricane center warned. Also, the storm could produce large swells affecting the western and southern coasts of the Lesser Antilles, the Caribbean islands that stretch from the Virgin Islands southward to the islands off Venezuela's coast. The swells could cause beach erosion and damage coastal structures, the hurricane center said. Antigua, Barbuda and Montserrat are under a tropical storm warning, meaning they could experience tropical storm conditions over the coming 24 hours. A tropical storm watch is in effect for Guadeloupe. The storm's forecast track shows it heading into the open waters of the Atlantic Ocean after crossing over the Virgin Islands and sweeping past Puerto Rico, but hurricane tracks are subject to variation, and such long-range predictions can change. Omar formed Tuesday in the eastern Caribbean. It is the 15th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1 and ends November 30.","NEW: Omar becomes Category 3 hurricane as it approaches Leeward Islands .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A long line of hospital staff wraps around the corridor outside a small conference room in New York to catch a glimpse of the precious cargo. A worker looks at the mummified skull of King Tut in November 2007. Inside are the three frail bodies in open wooden crates causing all the commotion. Another body -- a prince no less -- is a few rooms down in a computer tomography scanner. The bodies are part of the Brooklyn Museum's collection of 11 Egyptian mummies, transported to the North Shore University Hospital to be scanned. The goal: Find out who they are, how they might have died and establish a chronology of advances in ancient Egypt's mummification techniques. The process is not necessarily new. Egyptian mummies have been exposed to radiographic study since 1896 and CT scans, which conducts imaging by sections, for more than two decades. Perhaps the most famous of them, King Tutankhamun (c. 1355-346 B.C.), was scanned in 2005 right outside the vault that holds his sarcophagus. The scan resulted in more than 17,000 images that were analyzed by an international team of radiologists, pathologists and anatomists, led by the world-renowned Zahi Hawass, the secretary general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities. The scope and ability of CT scan technology are proving invaluable in learning more about the funeral rituals of ancient Egyptians and the mummies themselves. Whereas conventional X-rays cannot clearly distinguish soft tissue from bone and can see only two planes, CT scanning can differentiate among the various types of bone and soft tissue, and reconstruct three-dimensional images that ""show fine detail inside coronary arteries down to 0.6 millimeters"" said Amgad Makaryus, director of cardiac CT and magnetic resonance imaging at North Shore, providing a better chance at diagnosis and differentiation among diseases. ""CT has proved to be exceptionally well-suited for studying the fragile, wrapped figures of Egyptian mummies, especially those still contained within their decorated plasterlike shells, or cartonnages,"" according to an article by a team of eight researchers, led by Derek N.H. Notman, published in the American Journal of Roentgenology. CT scanning is fast and non-invasive, Makaryus agrees. A scan of one of the four bodies brought to North Shore quickly revealed that the mummy named Lady Hor was actually a man. The body never had to leave its cartonnage for the procedure. In the case of King Tut, initial X-rays of his mummy decades ago showed fragments of bone inside his skull, causing speculation that he might have been killed by a blow to the back of the head. The scan immediately revealed that his skull was intact; and the team found no other indication of foul play, according to its report. ""King Tut is the icon of Egyptian history, but he is only one of thousands of mummies we can study. Through CT scans, we can, in a way, bring the dead back to life,"" Hawass told National Geographic magazine. In another famous case, a CT scan helped identify the mummy of the Pharaoh Ramses I (1293-1291 B.C.) in 2000. It had been bought from a Canadian museum by the Michael C. Carlos Museum in Atlanta, Georgia. Dr. Heidi Hoffman, a former radiology resident at Emory now practicing in Chicago, Illinois, and part of the team of scientists who analyzed the pharaoh's body, was able to observe a type of bone erosion, and ""coalescence of air cells can be seen in cases of chronic mastoiditis,"" an inflammatory condition usually due to chronic ear infections. Though easily treatable with antibiotics today, the pharaoh's untreated ear infection could have spread and caused his death. At North Shore, Jesse Chusid, director of Imaging Informatics at the Department of Radiology, said the 64-slice CT scanner takes 0.6 mm-thick sectional scans and combines and magnifies them to provide extraordinary detail. Curators of the Brooklyn Museum reached out to North Shore for the first time in 2007, to scan Demetrios, a 2,000-year-old mummy, before he was to join a traveling exhibit called ""To Live Forever: Egyptian Treasures From the Brooklyn Museum,"" opening at the Chrysler Museum in Norfolk, Virginia, in October. Demetrios is called a ""red shroud mummy"" because of unusual red pigment in his linen shroud. Another red shroud mummy is in the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, California. There, CT scans revealed the remains of a mummified ibis, a bird sacred to Egyptians, wrapped inside. Curators of the Brooklyn Museum wanted to find out whether Demetrios had his own ibis, thought to be a sacrifice to the god Toth, whose head was an ibis. Demetrios did not have one. Still, Dr. Lawrence Boxt of North Shore University Hospital told The New York Times in 2007 that Demetrios either ""had an easy life or was carried around a lot. He certainly didn't do much heavy lifting during his lifetime."" The same was true for the mummy of the royal prince Count of Thebes, Pa-seba-khai-en-ipet. Edward Bleiberg, curator of Egyptian, classical and ancient Middle Eastern art at the Brooklyn Museum, said initial findings of his scan reaffirmed his high status: A small incision to the side of the abdomen to remove the organs, while carefully leaving the heart in place, then filling the body with embalming liquids -- all indicated a high-quality mummification process. Why the heart? In ancient Egypt, the heart was considered the thinking organ -- the center of the soul and the source of knowledge, Bleiberg said. ""The heart knows what a person thinks and feels,"" he said. ""It is supposed to be left in place during mummification so that it could be weighed against the feather of truth in the final judgment."" The images produced on the latest mummies at North Shore will have to be studied for months before researchers gain new insight into ancient Egyptian funeral practices. In the meantime, some revelations brought to light by the scans beg more questions yet: Pa-seba-khai-en-ipet seems to have a tube lodged inside him, running from his mouth through his esophagus and into the top of his chest. Bleiberg said he and Makaryus are pretty certain that was not the cause of death, and that it was inserted post-mortem. Purpose? That might be lost to the ages.","Radiologists at NY hospital analyze Egyptian mummies .

"New York (CNN) -- Authorities on Sunday released the name of a woman who turned up in New York this month saying she had no memory of her name or family. She is Kacie Aleece Peterson, 18, of Hansville, Washington, according to Paul Browne, deputy commissioner of the New York Police Department. Police a day earlier said a CNN viewer in Maryland identified the woman, who was found in Midtown Manhattan on October 9 outside a youth shelter. A photo of Peterson, who had been referred to as Jane Doe, was circulated by police and aired on CNN this week. Authorities didn't release Peterson's name until Sunday. Browne said Peterson's mother is dead and that her father is heading to New York. CNN affiliate KOMO-TV in Seattle, Washington, reported that her father went to New York on Sunday to bring her home. The family said it's not the first time she disappeared and then later was found with apparent memory loss, the station reported. Peterson is from Colville in eastern Washington, KOMO reported. She had been living with a friend in Hansville and attending Kingston High School. The father said the daughter had gone to live temporarily with a friend of her late mother, the station reported. Scott Wilson, spokesman for the Kitsap County Sheriff's Office, said Peterson was reported missing by her father on October 1, KOMO reported. Detectives later discovered bank activity and other evidence that she was alive, he said. The woman was found outside Manhattan's Covenant House youth shelter around 12:30 a.m. October 9. The organization said that she was not a resident at the time and did not appear as if she intended to seek refuge at the facility. A security guard for the shelter noticed the woman walking on the sidewalk near Covenant House and approached her. Finding her unresponsive, he called the New York City Police Department. Police officers interviewed the woman, but it became clear that she couldn't provide authorities with any information about herself. Police said she was wearing military green camouflage pants, a black shirt and a pair of black sneakers when she was discovered. The CNN viewer who identified her was familiar with her situation and knew she had been missing this month, police said. Police said they do not know how she lost her memory. ""I just want to know who I am and what happened to me,"" the young woman said in a statement previously released by the New York City Administration of Children's Services. Evan Buxbaum, Susan Candiotti and Vanessa Juarez contributed to the report.","KOMO-TV: Family says this isn't first time woman found with apparent memory loss .

"(LifeWire) -- Nancy Dunetz, who teaches English as a second language in New York City, sat down in the school staff room to check her e-mail. One of the messages in her inbox was from an acquaintance she'd been corresponding with since their 50th high school reunion last year. In a survey of 4,000 people, about a third said they had accidentally sent an e-mail to the wrong person. But this e-mail last June didn't contain chummy banter or reminiscences. It simply included a lewd photo of a partly unclothed young man. The file name of the picture was ""Mid East Hottie."" ""I was shocked!"" says Dunetz, 68. She hastily closed the e-mail and tried to erase the image from her mind. Later that day, the sender e-mailed an apology to her and two dozen others who had received the e-mail. He explained he'd been experimenting with his new computer and was trying to figure out how to add attachments to an e-mail, Dunetz says. In doing so, he attached an image from his desktop and tried to send it to himself. Instead, the e-mail program automatically filled in an entire group from his address book -- something he apparently didn't realize until after he hit the ""send"" button. ""I felt terrible for him,"" Dunetz says. ""I could imagine just how mortified he must have been."" With some 55 billion e-mails being sent daily (not including spam), according to e-mail archiving company The Radicati Group, misdirected e-mails have become the online equivalent of a wrong number. They're unavoidable, annoying -- and often embarrassing. The 'uh-oh' e-mail . In a recent online survey conducted by AOL, 32 percent of the 4,000 respondents have at one time or another mistakenly forwarded an e-mail to an unintended recipient. And often, it's something not so nice. Karla Comer, an account executive at an ad agency in Greensboro, North Carolina, knows just how embarrassing that can be. In 2004, Comer met a guy at a concert and went out with him a few times, but ultimately realized she wasn't interested. ""He was just awkward and clumsy. And sometimes I'd catch him staring at me, which really creeped me out,"" she says. She tried to end the relationship by simply not returning his phone calls. ""But then he e-mailed and casually said that he had not heard from me in a while and he hoped everything was fine but just assumed I was busy,"" says Comer, 31. ""Before I returned his e-mail, I sent the message to a close girlfriend with a blurb about what an idiot I thought he was and that dating him was a bad idea because he had no understanding of social cues."" She thought she sent the ""he's an idiot"" e-mail only to her girlfriend. To her horror, Comer says, the spurned beau replied a few minutes later, calling her some not-so-sweet names and suggesting that she ""share THIS e-mail with your friends."" ""I was speechless,"" says Comer, who chose to not respond. ""But eventually I was able to laugh at it."" When errant e-mails are sent at work, however, there's often much more at stake than personal embarrassment. Three years ago, Jamie Diamond, 33, e-mailed his then-boss to ask about a client at the public relations firm where he was working. His boss wrote back, criticizing the client as incompetent and urging Diamond to ""go around him if you want to get anything done."" Unfortunately, Diamond says, she also sent the e-mail to the client -- oops, make that ex-client. ""One click, and suddenly we'd lost a $5 million account,"" says Diamond, who is now self-employed as a publicist in Williams, Oregon. Can you turn back time? Short of erasing someone's memory, there is no surefire way to retrieve a missent e-mail. Microsoft Outlook has a ""recall"" function that can erase unread e-mails from the in-box of the recipient -- as long as the recipient is using the same mail client or server as the sender -- as does AOL, but only for messages between AOL users. (Both AOL and CNN are divisions of Time Warner.) Then there's BigString.com, an e-mail service which lets you tinker with (or even erase) messages that have already been sent by having the sender write e-mails that are created, stored and viewed on a remote server, where they can be edited or revoked at any time; recipients are actually accessing the e-mail on the remote server when they read the message, even though it looks like a regular e-mail. But old-fashioned vigilance is probably the best way to avert these snafus in the first place. Roger Matus, CEO of e-mail archiving company InBoxer Inc. and keeper of the blog Death By Email, believes the easiest way to avoid these mistakes is to forget that the ""reply all"" button even exists. ""Simply put, there is rarely a real reason to use it,"" he says. ""Often, when you hit it, you end up e-mailing people who were blind carbon copied without realizing."" Matus offers the following tips on avoiding e-mail embarrassment: . • Type out the person's full name when addressing your e-mail. If you type just the first few letters and let your e-mail program fill out the rest based on your address book, it could easily misroute your message without your realizing it. • Double-check the addresses of your intended recipients before you hit ""send."" Do you really want all the people to get this particular message? • Be sure to notify your company's legal department if there is any chance that governance, compliance or privacy regulations were violated as a result of something you sent by mistake. • Immediately notify the person who received the e-mail that it was a mistake and, if possible, ask them not to read the message -- or at least to delete it right away.

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- ""Amelia"" is a frustratingly old-school, Hollywood-style, inspirational biopic about Amelia Earhart that doesn't trust a viewer's independent assessment of the famous woman pictured on the screen. Hilary Swank plays Amelia Earhart and Richard Gere plays husband George Putnam in ""Amelia."" The mystery we ought to be paying attention to is: What really happened on the legendary American aviator's final, fatal flight in 1937? But the question audiences are left with is this: How could so tradition-busting a role model have resulted in so square, stiff, and earthbound a movie? Why present such a modern woman in such a fusty format? Dressed for the title role in a wardrobe of jumpsuits, leather jackets, scarves, and slinky evening wear dashing enough to stop air traffic, Hilary Swank's Earhart doesn't so much talk as make stump speeches -- even when she's at her own breakfast table. And director Mira Nair (""The Namesake""), working from an overexplanatory script by Ron Bass and Anna Hamilton Phelan (based on dual biographies by Susan Butler and Mary S. Lovell), overloads the picture with a cargo of messages, so much so that she deadens her subject's spirit. Some of these talking points are aimed at today's teenage girls who might admire the subject's highly personal fashion sense; others go out to older women who cherish her feminist cred. All of them add up to banners that might as well be flown from an aircraft tail over a beach: Amelia Earhart lived free in life and love! And Fly! She! Must! Of course, she did, setting records as the first woman to fly across the Atlantic in 1928 (she was a passenger, but still, ladies of the day generally didn't wear leather helmets and zoom through the air). Earhart was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic in 1932. She went on to launch her own brand-name fashion line. In 1935, she became the first pilot to fly solo from Hawaii to California. Sometimes the press dubbed her Lady Lindy, linking her fame to that of pioneering pilot Charles Lindbergh. Most famously, she vanished (along with her navigator, Fred Noonan) in the middle of the Pacific while on an around-the-world flight in 1937; her plane was never found, and she was declared legally dead in 1939. Along the way, the celebrity married George Putnam, the publisher and tireless promoter who shaped her public image. (Richard Gere does the honors as Putnam with all the dated, silver-head-in-hands poses required of him as a worried businessman/spouse whose wife is also his client.) For a time, the freethinking woman also conducted a love affair with aeronautics pioneer Gene Vidal (Ewan McGregor), now best known as the father of writer Gore Vidal. Swank delivers long, carefully composed explications of Earhart's unorthodox attitude toward marriage and feminine autonomy, taken from her journal entries, in studied accents somewhere between those of the Kansas plains of Earhart's birth and those of Katharine Hepburn in her most famous trouser-wearing, gumption-gal roles. iReport.com: Share your movie reviews . ""Amelia"" dutifully conveys the salient biographical info with a trusty cinematic device: As Earhart and Noonan embark on their doomed flight, flashbacks catch the audience up on the events that got her there. (Christopher Eccleston, as Noonan, is the one understated player in this endeavor.) Those last 10 minutes or so of radio-communications loss, concurrent instrument failure, and dawning awareness of disaster are honestly gripping. But just in case the point isn't clear enough (She! Must! Fly!), throughout the drama composer Gabriel Yared lays on blasts of musical exclamations that are as distracting as sirens. Sometimes that music says, ""It's great to be in the sky and surfing the clouds!"" Sometimes it says, ""Look how pretty the landscape looks below -- kind of makes you miss the music in 'Out of Africa,' right?"" Sometimes the rumble of violins and horns hints, ""Uh-oh, we're getting to the tragic part of the story!"" Mostly, the busy orchestra backs up the starry cinematography to remind us, ""This slim, androgynous beauty, with her unusual love life and her driving need to take to the skies, sure was something, huh?!""

""There's hope. And I hope to transmit that to my children."" Chinoise Noble and her mother, Yolanda Lee-Singleton, watched the inauguration in Los Angeles' Nokia Plaza. In California at downtown Los Angeles' Nokia Plaza, 23-year-old Chinoise Noble clutched a photograph of her grandmother as tears streamed down her face. She said she brought the photo so her late grandmother could be with her on a day though that her grandmother never believed would come. She ""would never in a million years have thought there'd be a black president!"" Noble said. In Birmingham, Alabama, the site of racial turmoil during the Civil Rights era, Fred Jemison had high hopes for the Obama administration. ""The biggest thing that I look forward to, that I anticipate from this, is unity throughout the country, racially and politically,"" Jemison told CNN affiliate WBMA at Birmingham's Boutwell Auditorium. At the Jewish Home, a senior living facility in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, about 70 residents and staff members watched the inauguration. ""This is wonderful and exciting,"" said 92-year-old Sylvia Segal, wearing a Barack Obama T-shirt. ""There's never been an inauguration like this one, with so many millions giving respect to the United States and an extraordinary man."" Shelly Balzac, 81, said that he voted for Obama and that when he was a teenager, his father took him to Chicago's Soldier Field to witness Franklin Delano Roosevelt campaigning. ""It's momentous when you look at the conglomeration of all citizens of all colors and all creeds,"" said Balzac, a World War II veteran who said he witnessed the ""dehumanizing of blacks"" during those years and fought against it within the U.S. military. ""It is an emotional day for me,"" Balzac said. ""I realize the tremendous stride in making this a more unified country."" Stan Keller and his daughter, Nancy, watch the inauguration at the Jewish Home in Los Angeles. ""I was crying inside all day,"" said Stan Keller, 88. He said Obama has inspired him to try to make a difference in the world. ""I came on Earth to make it a better place to live. I get that inspiration from this man,"" he said. iReporter Lee Ann Schmidt of Danbury, Connecticut, watched at home with her husband and two dogs. ""Just to be alive in this time to witness this, it means more to me than anything,"" she said. ""I'm 35. My generation has never really seen the entire country come together in a positive way like this. It really does give me hope for our country."" In Raleigh, North Carolina, iReporter Sam Shaber watched the events with his parents at their house. ""We are all snowed in and have a bottle of champagne ready,"" he said. ""I am gay, and to have just any minority be elected is such a milestone in so many ways."" Hopes for Obama . Jeff Teasley, a 49 year-old Navy veteran from Cheyenne, Wyoming, has been disabled since he hurt his back in 1990. Jeff Teasley, in his home in Cheyenne, Wyoming, hopes Obama is ""the best thing since running water."" Teasley, a Republican who did not vote for Obama, was less enthusiastic over Obama's inauguration. Like many here in Wyoming, he fears that President Obama will expand the government and pass the cost onto people like him. ""With bigger government comes bigger taxes and with bigger taxes comes more strain on everybody's households."" But Teasley said he is still rooting for the new president. ""I hope he pulls it off. I hope he's the best thing since running water because we need a leader, we need someone to direct these people in Washington."" Others were more optimistic.

"(WIRED) -- With rumors piling up about a forthcoming Apple tablet, it appears more and more likely that such a device will emerge soon. This illustration imagines what an Apple tablet device might look like. But what's still unclear is how this gadget will set itself apart from Apple's multimedia-savvy product line, including the iPhone and iPod Touch, as well as the scores of failed tablet PCs that have come and gone. Judging from the company's past moves, we're betting that Apple's tablet will be a media-centric device, focused -- at least in part -- on shaking up the publishing industry. Apple is already prepared to blow Amazon and other e-book makers out of the water with one key weapon: iTunes. Having served more than 6 billion songs to date, the iTunes Store has flipped the music industry on its head. It also turned mobile software into a lucrative industry, as proven by the booming success of the iPhone's App Store, which recently surpassed 1.5 billion downloads. Apple has yet to enter the e-book market, and making books as easy to download as music and iPhone apps is the logical next step. What can Apple do better with e-books? For textbooks or anthologies, Apple can give iTunes users the ability to download individual chapters, priced between a few cents to a few bucks each. It would be similar to how you can currently download individual song tracks from an album. It might even have the same earthshaking potential to transform an entire industry by refocusing it on the content people actually want instead of the bundles that publishers want them to buy. (Of course, Apple would likely offer the à-la-carte purchase model in addition to the option to purchase the entire book as one download -- a more attractive option for shorter works such as novels.) College students would love this: Teachers rarely assign an entire textbook, so they would save hundreds of dollars by downloading only a few chapters of each textbook. Apple is already popular in the education sector, so here's even more money to milk from students, with the textbook industry worth an estimated $9.8 billion. Sci-fi fans might only want one story from an anthology, or a historical researcher might target certain subjects. All Apple has to do to secure the book publishers' enthusiastic cooperation is to offer them a generous cut of the revenues, like the 70 percent it currently offers app developers. Other than having the upper hand with digital distribution, an Apple tablet can compensate for other e-book readers' shortcomings. In a previous story, Wired.com polled students on their interest in Amazon's large-format Kindle DX reader. Several of them said they couldn't imagine ditching textbooks for a Kindle DX, foreseeing challenges with tasks such as notetaking, highlighting and switching between books while writing essays. Assuming its computing powers and interface design are anything like the iPhone's, a touchscreen tablet would make these student-oriented tasks as easy as a few swipes and taps -- far more pleasant than clunking around with the Kindle's cheap buttons and sluggish interface. Plus, we would imagine students would be able to type their papers on the tablet. Then there's the obvious: An Apple tablet would have color, making it better for displaying magazine pages, which could also be purchased through the iTunes Store. It wouldn't be saddled with a slow e-ink screen, so it could display video and browse the web with aplomb. Let's not forget to mention the multitude of other tasks an Apple tablet will likely be able to perform if developers decide to code applications for it. Think along the lines of an interactive remote control to enhance the movie-viewing experience on your TV, or a music video player to accompany the tunes blasting from your stereo. Or, heck, even an album-cover display screen for you to gaze at while listening to music. (For more on an Apple tablet's advantages versus current e-book readers, see Dylan Tweney's story ""Large-Screen Kindle Won't Mean Squat if Apple Tablet Arrives."") There's huge potential in a tablet if Apple can pull this off. The challenge lies in establishing the right partnerships. If Apple weaves e-books into the iTunes Store, will book publishers hop on board? Given Apple's success in numbers, we think so. As for a data provider, it would be even better if Apple could work with a carrier such as Verizon to subsidize the tablet, bringing it closer to $500 -- a more attractive price point for students. Because the device presumably would not feature a phone, the monthly plans could be priced significantly lower than an iPhone -- $30 to $40, perhaps, for an unlimited 3-G Internet connection.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It is not often that football players are actively encouraged to play dirty -- unless of course they are taking part in a unique variant of the game called ""Swamp Soccer"" when it is virtually unavoidable. The competition is fierce in the 2009 Swamp Soccer World Championship held in Scotland . Originating from the bogs of Finland, the game was started by cross-country skiers who used the football matches in knee-deep mud to strengthen their leg muscles.  The first tournament took place in 1997 with 13 teams, but now annual events take place in Sweden, Iceland, Russia and Brazil which can often feature over 200 teams.  What do you think of Swamp Soccer? Do you prefer Beach Football of another form of the game? Let us know your thoughts on the 'Sound off' box below. Glasgow Rangers fan Stewart Miller imported the concept to the United Kingdom after a chance meeting with founder Jyrki Vaananen while on a business trip to Iceland. Miller launched the first UK tournament in 2005 and now teams travel from all over the globe to the Scottish village of Strachur to try and become the annual Swamp Soccer World Champions.  Watch the action from the bog ». ""We had teams coming from as far afield as Australia and New Zealand to take part in the tournament this year so there is an international flavor to the event,"" Miller told CNN. ""There is a huge appetite to try out new things and I think that's why Swamp Soccer is able to capture the imagination of people. ""The basic rules of football also apply to Swamp Soccer with the exception that matches are played in thick mud with six players on an oversized five-a-side pitch. ""It's probably one of the only sports in the world where the worse the conditions are the better the sporting spectacle!"" There is no offside in Swamp Soccer while kick-offs, throw-ins, corner kicks, free kicks and penalties are taken by using the hands to drop the ball onto a chosen foot. Teams are also allowed to make unlimited substitutions although no shoe changing is allowed for the match duration. Miller believes that the oft-used quote that the state of a pitch can bridge the gap between two unevenly match teams is even more applicable with Swamp Soccer. ""You could put the Brazilian national side up against an amateur team and you wouldn't know who would come out on top -- the pitch really does prove to be a leveler in this instance,"" he said. ""Although professional footballers are precious commodities these days -- I'm not sure we'll see any stars getting caked in mud too soon, most of them are far to pampered for that. ""Nobody's ever been injured seriously playing in the swamp, sometimes somebody's got a cut or two but nothing big -- so maybe when they retire from the game they might be prepared to give it a go."" The imaginatively titled Real Mudrid, Mudchesthair United and Cowdungbeath were unable to make it past the group stages in the 44-team event which was won by FC Full Gunge from Poole in England who retained their title with a 1-0 victory over The Chocolate Men. This year's Swamp Soccer tournament was held in a village in the Scottish countryside but Miller revealed that he intends to bring the mud game to metropolitan areas. He added: ""The future for Swamp Soccer is in the city and of course I'm certain we'll bring all the mud with us. It will certainly make a great spectacle if set up a swamp in the middle of Glasgow or Edinburgh, so watch this space.""

"(CNN) -- Tropical Storm Ana threatened the Caribbean on Saturday, but it was too early to know how much trouble the first named storm of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane season might cause. Forecasters expect Tropical Storm Ana to hit the Leeward Islands on Monday. Ana formed overnight and was expected to gain strength as it moved west toward the Leeward Islands, where forecasters expect it to hit on Monday. The Dutch Antilles issued a storm watch for St. Maarten, Saba and St. Eustatius, meaning tropical storm conditions are expected in the islands within 36 hours, according to the Miami, Florida-based National Hurricane Center. For now, the center has advised the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico to monitor the storm's progress. As of 8 p.m. ET, Ana was about 730 miles (1,180 km) east-southeast of the Leeward Islands, according to the hurricane center. Ana, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph), was moving west at about 17 mph (28 kph), the center reported. The storm is expected to turn west-northwest over the next few days, the center said. Ana may eventually hit Haiti and the Dominican Republic, but forecasters can't say whether Ana will strike the continental U.S. Further east in the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Bill has developed and is expected to become a hurricane Wednesday. Forecasters say Bill could evolve into a Category 3 hurricane as it approaches the Leeward Islands by Wednesday or Thursday. Bill was about 820 miles (1,320 km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands at 5 p.m. ET.","NEW: Ana is 730 miles east of Leeward Islands, moving west at 17mph .

"(CNN) -- Months after her father's prolonged campaign against President Obama's national security policies, Liz Cheney is spearheading a new organization aimed at organizing conservative opposition to the new administration's foreign policy approach. Liz Cheney formed Keep America Safe with William Kristol and Debra Burlingame. The new group, Keep America Safe, says its aim is to provide a cogent and organized rebuttal to a series of recent moves that expressly divert from the more muscular policies of the Bush administration. The group plans to tackle hot-button issues like the way forward in Iraq and Afghanistan, defense spending, CIA interrogation techniques, and the planned closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. ""We have watched with concern and dismay as the Obama administration has cut defense spending, wavered on the war in Afghanistan, and launched investigations into Americans serving on the front lines of the war on terror, while at the same time expanding legal protections for the terrorists that plot to attack this country,"" Cheney, along with the group's two other founders, wrote on its Web site. ""These policies, along with President Obama's abandonment of America's allies and attempts to appease our adversaries are weakening the nation."" Weekly Standard Editor William Kristol and Debra Burlingame, the sister of the pilot of American Airlines Flight 77 -- the flight that crashed into the Pentagon on 9/11 -- are also heading up the new effort. The new group says its goal is to focus media attention on continuing and emerging national security threats, and marshal grassroots opposition to the president's policies. ""Too often, significant events and thoughtful analysis in the war on terror are glossed over or ignored on nightly national newscasts,"" the group writes. ""Keep America Safe will highlight this information on our website and encourage dialogue between American citizens and their elected representatives in order to produce the legislative and executive action that will keep this country safe and strong. "" A spokesman for the Democratic National Committee responded forcefully to the creation of the new group, saying the Cheneys' foreign policy approach ""was deemed a failure."" ""Last fall, the American people overwhelmingly rejected a radical foreign policy authored by Dick Cheney that alienated our allies, emboldened our enemies, depleted our resources, distracted our focus and made the nation less secure,"" DNC Press Secretary Hari Sevugan said. ""The Cheneys can continue to focus on securing their sullied legacy if they want to. But, the president will continue to focus on securing the country."" Incorporated as a non-profit 501(c) 4, the organization is not subject to contribution limits, and is not required to disclose a list of its contributors to the Federal Elections Commission. However, it cannot engage in efforts directly aimed at influencing the outcome of an election. Kicking off a fund-raising drive Tuesday, Keep America Safe launched a one-minute, 30-second Web video that portrays Obama as a wavering politician whose ambitious foreign policy promises as a candidate have not matched his actions. ""Not enough time for a decision, but plenty of time for Letterman, golf, a beer summit, more golf, vacation, and a visit to Copenhagen,"" the video states. Cheney has been no stranger to the media spotlight since the Bush administration left office nine months ago. Regularly appearing on a series of cable news shows, the eldest daughter of former vice president has criticized Obama on a host of moves, once concluding that he has ""sid[ed] with the terrorists."" The former vice president has also been a vocal critic of Obama, declaring earlier this year that the president's decision to cease the CIA's practice of aggressive interrogation practices has left the country more vulnerable to a terrorist attack.","Keep America Safe says its goal is providing effective rebuttal to Obama .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Chess legends Garry Kasparov and Anatoli Karpov faced off again in Spain on Tuesday, 25 years after their epic first world championship battle in Moscow, in what organizers are calling a ""historic revenge match."" Garry Kasparov, right, and Anatoli Karpov play chess at the Arts Palau in Valencia, on Tuesday. Revenge or not, the past chess champs will receive undisclosed sums for playing the three-day, 12-game match in the eastern port city of Valencia. There will be no additional cash prize for the winner of the exhibition event, which the regional Valencia government is organizing under the title ""Valencia, cradle of modern chess,"" event spokesman Rafa Carretero told CNN. But bragging rights, yes, and perhaps with more on the line for Kasparov, who dominated the chess world for 20 years. Kasparov carried on that legacy on Tuesday, winning the first two games in this rematch, Spain's state new agency EFE reported. Karpov was world champion when they began their initial five-month match in 1984 in Moscow. That match was controversially stopped by chess authorities, citing concerns about the health of the contestants after 48 grueling games. But the next year in Moscow, Kasparov beat Karpov in a rematch and went on to hold the number-one world chess ranking almost without interruption until his retirement in 2005. The two last met, in their fifth match, in 1990, with games played in New York and Lyon, France. Kasparov won. In a total of five world championship matches, Kasparov has the edge with 21 wins, 19 losses and 104 ties in a total of 144 games. Karpov, now 58, and Kasparov, 46, told Spanish newspaper El Pais they hoped the rematch in Valencia would put chess in the spotlight again. Karpov came from Russia to Valencia more than a week ago, with a team of elite trainers, organizers said. Kasparov arrived last Sunday from his home in Croatia, where he had been training. The match, at Valencia's Palace of Arts, has attracted interest from ticket buyers on five continents, organizers said. One of the highest-profile fans on hand is Sulaiman Al-Fahim, president of the chess federation of the United Arab Emirates and owner of England's Portsmouth football team. Dutchman Geurt Gijssen, who was referee for the last two matches between Karpov and Kasparov, will referee this match as well, the organizers said. Kasparov is now an opposition politician in Russia, running unsuccessfully against then-President Vladimir Putin in 2007. During their first match, in 1984, Kasparov was just 21 and Karpov was 33.","Garry Kasparov and Anatoli Karpov face off again, in Valencia, Spain .

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Typhoon Melor roared into central Japan on Thursday, leaving two people dead and lashing the region with heavy rain and gusty winds.

Numerous flights were canceled and delayed at the city's two major airports. In western and northern  Japan, Melor tore roofs off homes, downed power lines and flooded roads. The storm contributed to the deaths of a 54-year-old newspaper delivery man in Wakayama, who ran into a fallen tree, and a 69-year-old man from Saitama, who was crushed by a tree.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Police in Connecticut say they have arrested a woman suspected of robbing at least six banks in the past week. Police released photos of a suspect in the robberies of six New England banks. Detectives from the Major Crimes division of the Connecticut State Police took Heather Brown into custody at about 3:15 p.m. The 34-year-old resident of Norwich, Connecticut, will be formally charged with robbery in the first degree, police said. Investigators believe Brown robbed the banks, often while claiming to have a bomb. ""When she goes into the banks, she gives the teller information through a note or verbally that she has a bomb,"" said Sgt. Jim Keeney of the Connecticut State Police. ""However, there haven't been any reports of an actual bomb."" Authorities say they believe the woman has held up banks in the Connecticut towns of Middletown, Montville, East Hartford and Windsor, as well as banks in West Springfield, Massachusetts and Westerly, Rhode Island. Women commit 6.2 percent of bank robberies nationwide, up from 4.9 percent in 2002, according to recent FBI figures. The one-woman crime wave in New England apparently began September 21 at the Citizens Bank in Montville, Connecticut. State police said ""a lone white female ... entered the bank with a bag in her possession. The suspect approached the teller indicated she was in possession of a bomb and demanded cash."" The woman left the bag on a counter and bolted, police said. Four days later, a woman entered a branch of the New Alliance Bank in East Hartford, Connecticut.

"(CNN) -- Muslims around the world woke up Sunday and welcomed the end of a long month of fasting with hearty greetings of ""Eid Mubarak,"" or happy festivities. Egyptian women perform the Eid al-Fitr dawn prayer at a stadium in Mansura, 120 km north of Cairo. The faithful were ushering in Eid al-Fitr -- three days of celebrations that Muslims mark with joyous community prayers, acts of charity, visits from far-flung relatives, gift-giving and elaborate feasts. ""Think Christmas, Thanksgiving, New Year's -- all rolled into one. It's that huge for us,"" said Sajjad Aziz of Hoboken, New Jersey. Islam follows a lunar calendar, and the timing of Eid al-Fitr varies around the world depending on when the crescent of a new moon is sighted. So, while most countries -- including the United States -- observed Eid on Sunday, some will begin their celebrations on Monday. The night before Eid, entire communities gather on rooftops, scanning the sky with giddy anticipation. ""It only needs one sighting of the moon in the whole country, and the whole nation erupts in cheers,"" said Qazi Arif, 35, of Sirajgong, Bangladesh. ""It's a divine feeling, hard to describe."" Eid al-Fitr bids goodbye to Ramadan -- a month of dawn-to-dusk abstinence from food, drinks and other sensual pleasures. Muslims believe the Quran, the religion's holy book, was revealed to Prophet Muhammad during Ramadan more than 1,400 years ago. The Eid is one of two major holidays in Islam, alongside another called Eid al-Adha. The latter commemorates the prophet Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son, Ishmael, for God. On the morning of Eid, Muslims don new clothes and head to prayers that are often held in open fields to accommodate crowds too big to contain in mosques. Those who can afford it donate a small percentage of their possession or its equivalent to the poor and needy so they too can avail themselves for the celebrations. Feasts await at every house. ""It's a festival principally about community. We're even asked to take a different route when we walk back from prayers so that we can meet different sets of people to greet and celebrate with,"" said Wasim Iqbal of Karachi, Pakistan. For Muslims in North America -- and countries where they are the minority -- Eid is a more subdued affair. ""If you have family close by, then you can kind of capture the mood that you remember from back home,"" said Abdallah Gamal, a native of Egypt who lives in St. Louis, Missouri. ""But it's not the same."" Because the U.S. Census does not ask about religious affiliation, it is difficult to gauge the Muslim population in the United States. The Pew Muslim American study conducted two years ago estimated it at 2.5 million, while the Council on American-Islamic Relations places it as high as 6 million. On Saturday, both President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton offered greetings to American Muslims. ""We know there is more than unites peoples of faith than divides us,"" Clinton said. ""So as Ramadan draws to a close, let us hold on to that spirit of community throughout the year to achieve our common goals of peace, prosperity and stability."" It is a message that Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, also shared during Eid prayers when he called on the Taliban to join the peace process in his war-weary country. The day wasn't one of universal comity, however. In Yemen, the government and rebels accused each other Saturday of breaking a cease-fire they both asked for to commemorate Eid. And Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei used his Eid sermon to launch another volley at the country's arch-rival Israel and at Western powers. ""We're not quite there, I'll will admit,"" said Mehreen Ali of Boston, Massachusetts. ""But have you seen an Eid prayer? Rows and rows of Muslims all prostrating together in unison. It's a feeling of such unity and brotherhood. You have to believe that with that spirit present, anything is possible.""","Eid al-Fitr marks end of Ramadan -- dawn-to-dusk abstinence from food, drinks .

"(CNN)  -- A superb second half goal from substitute Zlatan Ibrahimovic gave Barcelona a 1-0 win over arch-rivals Real Madrid to go back to the top of the Spanish La Liga on Sunday. Both teams ended with 10 men after Barca's Sergio Busquets went just after the hour mark for a second yellow card, with Real losing Lassana Diarra in the dying moments for two yellows. Ibrahimovic's goal was truly worthy of settling 'El Clasico' as the Swedish striker met a Daniel Alves ball from the right on the volley to leave Iker Casillas with no chance. The 55th minute strike in the Camp Nou came shortly after he replaced the ineffective Thierry Henry and followed an opening half in which visitors Real were the more threatening. Real had gone into the game with a one point lead in the standings over the defending Spanish and European champions and showed their quality on the break. Cristiano Ronaldo, making his first start in two months, might have put the visitors ahead in the 20th minute but was denied by home keeper Victor Valdes, who knocked his shot wide with his legs. Barcelona central defender Carlos Puyol also came to their rescue with two last-ditch challenges on Marcelo and Gonzalo Higuain from similar Real attacks. But the Catalans made the breakthrough as Ibrahimovic went some of the way to justifying his massive transfer fee and soon afterwards midfielder Xavi came within a whisker of a second from long-range. Further chances fell to Eric Abidal, who shot wide, and Argentine ace Lionel Messi, who was superbly denied by Casillas from close range. A tiring Ronaldo was substituted and his replacement, Karim Benzema, fired over the top in the 80th minute as Real pressed in vain for an equalizer. ""This was a very good test,"" Barca coach Pep Guardiola told gathered reporters. ""It's always difficult against Madrid but even more so when you go in as favorite and them as a big underdog. That's when Madrid is most dangerous."" The three points leave Barcelona on top with 30 points from 12 games, two ahead of Real on 28. Sevilla, who drew on Saturday, have 26. In other action on Sunday, Deportivo La Coruna had a hard-fought 1-0 win at Racing Santander to move level on points with fourth-placed Valencia.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher on Saturday denied that he is the man shown pointing at the Google Street View camera as it drove past his local pub in London last summer. Liam Gallagher says the figure captured on Google Earth outside a pub in London is not him. ""Just saw google earth apparently that's meant to be me, who ... wears legwarmers with reeboks??

The picture shows a man dressed in a dark T-shirt and long shorts sitting at an outdoor table. He points at the camera, obviously having seen the Google car and its Street View camera drive by.

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- For many, the creative relevance of 3-D cinema remains very much an open question. But when the history of Hollywood's 21st century embrace of 3-D is written, it very well may point to this weekend as the moment when the format definitively established its commercial power at the box office. ""The Final Destination"" scared up by far the most box office receipts, banking $28.3 million. Despite a moviegoing weekend dominated with R-rated violent thriller-type films ostensibly shooting for the same audience, ""The Final Destination"" scared up by far the most box office receipts, banking $28.3 million for an easy No. 1 berth, according to early estimates from Hollywood.com Box Office. That's almost $10 million better than the opening frame for the last film in the creatively-dispatching-model-perfect-unknown-actors franchise (which, for those keeping track, was ""Final Destination 3""). There's really only one reason why: Although just over half its 3,121 theaters were screening the flick in 3-D, fully 70 percent of its box office take was from 3-D theaters, which typically charge an extra few bucks per ticket for the privilege of watching the film with those comfy stereoscopic glasses. Rest assured, despite its title (and its abysmal ""C"" Cinemascore grade), this is by no means the final ""Final Destination"" movie. The folks at the The Weinstein Company, meanwhile, continue to enjoy good news for their much scrutinized bottom line: Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"" landed at No. 2 with a rather spectacular $20 million, just 47 percent down from its opening weekend for $73.7 million total. TWC's sister company Dimension Films, meanwhile, saw its ""Halloween II"" debut at third with a nothing-to-sneeze-at $17.4 million. Granted, director Rob Zombie's second re-imagining of the 31-years-old slasher franchise made nothing close to the $30.6 million Labor Day weekend debut of Zombie's first night out with Michael Myers. But given the steep competition, and the film's $15 million budget, Dimension must be breathing a sigh of relief that their film will most likely see a decent profit. The box office love continued through much of the weekend's top 10: District 9 dropped just 41 percent with $10.7 million, strong enough to hold on at fourth place and, with a $90.8 mil running total, well on its way to joining the $100 million club. At number five, ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra"" banged out $8 million, a 34 percent drop and $132 million total. And Julie & Julia savored a tiny 16 percent drop for sixth, with $7.4 million in its forth weekend for $70.9 million total. In fact, the only true disappointment for the weekend was Focus Features' ""Taking Woodstock."" Director Ang Lee's trip back to the iconic three-day concert debuted at ninth with just $3.7 million, doubly disappointing since it opened wide in 1,393 theaters (after a Wednesday opening in New York and Los Angeles), with a feeble $2,691 per theater average. By contrast, two limited release debuts did rather well: Vogue magazine documentary ""The September Issue"" bowed on six screens with a very fashionable $40,000 per theater average; and the extreme-sports-fandom-gone-wrong dramedy ""Big Fan"" won $13,000 per theater on two screens.

"(CNN) -- Two U.S. spacecraft are set to crash on the moon Friday. On purpose. And we're all invited to watch. An artist's rendering shows the LCROSS spacecraft, left, separating from its Centaur rocket. NASA's Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite is scheduled to drop its Centaur upper-stage rocket on the lunar surface at 7:31 a.m. ET. NASA hopes the impact will kick up enough dust to help the LCROSS probe find the presence of water in the moon's soil. Four minutes later, the LCROSS will follow through the debris plume, collecting and relaying data back to Earth before crashing into the Cabeus crater near the moon's south pole. The LCROSS is carrying spectrometers, near-infrared cameras, a visible camera and a visible radiometer. These instruments will help NASA scientists analyze the plume of dust -- more than 250 metric tons' worth -- for water vapor. The orbiting Hubble Space Telescope and NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter will watch, and photograph, the collisions. And hundreds of telescopes on Earth also will be focused on the two plumes.  Watch animation of how the moon will be ""bombed"" » . NASA is encouraging amateur astronomers to join the watch party. ""We expect the debris plumes to be visible through midsized backyard telescopes -- 10 inches and larger,"" said Brian Day at NASA's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, California. Day is an amateur astronomer who is leading education and public outreach for the LCROSS mission. Ames will host ""Impact Night,"" an event with music and food starting Thursday evening before a live transmission of the lunar impact will be shown around 4:30 a.m. PT Friday. Other science observatories and amateur astronomy clubs across the country will be hosting similar events. iReport: Are you planning to watch? ""The initial explosions will probably be hidden behind crater walls, but the plumes will rise high enough above the crater's rim to be seen from Earth,"" Day said. The Cabeus crater lies in permanent shadow, making observations inside the crater difficult.  Watch CNN's Jeanne Moos ask if lunacy is behind the moon ""bombing"" » . The impacts will not be visible to the naked eye or through binoculars. If you don't have a telescope, or you live in areas where daylight will obscure the viewing, NASA TV will broadcast the crashes live. Coverage begins at 6:15 a.m. ET Friday. The two main components of the LCROSS mission are the shepherding spacecraft and the Centaur upper stage rocket. The spacecraft will guide the rocket to its crash site. Data from previous space missions have revealed trace amounts of water in lunar soil. The LCROSS mission seeks a definitive answer to the question of how much water is present. NASA has said it believes water on the moon could be a valuable resource in the agency's quest to explore the solar system. LCROSS launched with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter aboard an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on June 18. Friday's lunar impact will be visible best in areas that are still dark, particularly in the Western United States. The Fremont Peak Observatory near Monterey, California, will open up its doors early Friday to allow people to watch the event through its 30-inch telescope. It's ""the most accessible public telescope in the [San Francisco] Bay Area,"" said Dave Samuels, the observatory's vice president. So far, at least 50 people have signed up, Samuels said, noting that number is ""really phenomenal, especially on a school night [and] work night. It's really incredible."" Students, retirees and board members are among those scheduled to attend. Samuels said a special low-light, infrared video camera will be hooked up to the telescope so that the audience can watch the rocket strike the moon. The observatory is in Fremont Peak State Park, which is on a list of California parks that could close because of recent budget cuts. Samuels said he hopes Friday's event triggers more interest in astronomy, particularly among young children, and possibly help the park to stay open. ""It's things like this that get kids interested [in science],"" he said. ""It will probably be a defining moment for them."" Darrick Gray, who teaches atmospheric sciences at Ray-Pec High School near Kansas City, Missouri, said he's planning to take 17 students -- all juniors and seniors -- to watch the lunar impact . ""This is truly a once-in-a-lifetime thing,"" Gray said. He said he's arranged for a school bus to pick up the kids early Friday and take the class to the Powell Observatory in Louisburg, Kansas. ""It's weather-dependent; we've got rain right now,"" Gray said. ""It's going to be a call I make at 5 a.m."" Gray, who is also the director of the Astronomical Society of Kansas City, said his students will try to take photos of the impact through the eyepiece of their telescopes. He said he hopes the event will influence his students to pursue careers in science. ""Being as we do live here in Missouri, we're away from the hub [of astronomy],"" Gray said. ""We're not in Florida, we're not in Texas, we're not in Silicon Valley -- it's not something they're used to seeing. ""So any time you can show them something that's never been done, and they say, 'Oh this is pretty cool,' I think they buy into that.""","A NASA spacecraft is set to drop a rocket on the moon at 7:31 a.m. ET Friday .

"(Oprah.com) -- A businesswoman, a mother of four, an international fashion icon, a woman committed to making the world a better place for women and children -- Queen Rania of Jordan is truly changing the world. Queen Rania says cultural dialogue, education and increased opportunities are ways to combat terrorism. Rania Al-Yassin was born in Kuwait. Shortly after Saddam Hussein invaded that country in 1990, her family fled and settled in Jordan. After graduating from business school, Rania began working her way up the corporate ladder. When she was just 22, she went to a dinner party where she met Jordan's Prince Abdullah -- considered one of the world's most eligible bachelors. He didn't remain one for long after that night. Six months later, Rania and Abdullah had a royal wedding and started a family. And, though they planned for a life as royals, Abdullah assumed he'd remain a military officer for life. In 1999, while on his deathbed, King Hussein of Jordan stunned his country by announcing that his son Abdullah -- not his brother -- would succeed him as king. That made 29-year-old Rania the world's youngest living queen. Rania says that being queen is not the trait she defines herself by. ""I am not at all conscious of it,"" she says. ""I make a conscious effort not to be conscious of it. Because I'm Rania, you know? People call me 'Queen,' but, you know, that's not me ... I'm Rania."" There are many perks to being queen, of course, but Rania stresses that there are also responsibilities. ""One of the major misconceptions about this position is that people think that I might be far removed, that I might not be in touch with reality,"" she says. ""The honest truth is that my life is very much about dealing with issues on the ground, dealing with ... the problems that our country faces. That's something I do on a daily basis.""  Watch how Queen Rania uses technology to reach young people » . When most people think of queens, they probably think of what they know from fairy tales. ""For me, it's just real life,"" Rania says. ""I am a mother. I care about my children. I worry about what they eat. I worry about the influences from their friends."" Rania is not only sitting royalty in Jordan, she's raising the next generation of royals too. She is the mother of four children -- 14-year-old Hussein, 12-year-old Iman, 8-year-old Salma and 3-year-old Hashem. Rania says her family tries very hard to remain down to earth. The family has relaxed much of the ceremonial pomp and circumstance of their position. Rania prefers that people not refer to her as ""Your Majesty"" ... and King Abdullah loves to barbecue! The family never discusses the possibility that Hussein, their oldest child, could be the future king of Jordan, Rania says. Instead, she says the family strives to remain like any other family. For instance, to get the things they want, the children have to clean their rooms and do well in school. ""The most important thing is to instill them with the right values,"" Rania says. ""I just feel that values are the shield that you carry with you throughout life. It protects you from whatever life throws at you."" Rania has become famous around the world for her efforts to improve educational opportunities for girls and the rights of women. ""In my mind, poverty is a 'she,'"" Rania says. Helping others is something Rania says she feels compelled to do. ""Once you feel that others are like you, then you want for others what you want for yourself,"" she says. ""And that way you start helping others."" Rania explains that there is a direct relationship between increasing education and eliminating poverty. ""You can change the course of a nation through education,"" she says. ""One of the most important things you can do for a girl is empower her with her education. Once she has the education, she can then have control over her income, she can change her life, she can have choices."" To understand what life is like for the women in Rania's kingdom, ""The Oprah Show"" spent a day with a few women in Amman, the capital city of Jordan. One woman named Muna worries about striking a balance between work and motherhood. Part of that means preparing lunch -- the most important meal in Jordanian culture -- for her family. Unlike in America, most children and husbands return home to eat with their families for lunch. Just like in America, Muna cooks a variety of meals, everything from traditional Arabic food to hamburgers and spaghetti. In this largely Muslim country, one religious tradition is increasingly a matter of choice. Approximately 60 percent of Jordanian women wear a veil. Though Queen Rania says she has never worn a veil, she understands why a woman would want to. ""We think it's a personal choice,"" she says. ""Unfortunately, in the West, people look at the veil as a sign of oppression or weakness. This is not true as long as a woman is wearing it because of her belief. I always say we should judge a woman according to what's going on in their heads rather than what's going on top of their heads."" Rania says that when people focus on differences between cultures -- especially stereotypes and things like veils -- they fail to realize just how similar all people are. ""Once you go beyond the mannerisms, the language, the cultural idiosyncrasies, you realize that you're basically the same, you know?"" she says. Rania also wants to break down the stereotypes the West holds about her culture. ""I would like to dispel the misconception that Arabs are all extremists, that Arab people are violent and that women in the Arab world are oppressed and suppressed,"" she says. The struggle we feel today is not really Middle East against the West, Rania says, but rather it is between extremists and moderates of all religions. ""We need to speak up,"" she says. ""The biggest nightmare for the extremists is for us to get along, and that's why we have to get along. We have to communicate more."" In the future, Rania says she hopes for a more open and secure world. ""We look at problems happening halfway across the world and we think, 'Well, that's their problem.' But it's not,"" she says. ""When you solve somebody else's problem, you're solving a problem for yourself because our world today is so interconnected."" Rania says solving problems that stem from intolerance -- like terrorism -- require cultural dialogue, education and increased opportunities. ""We have to create opportunities for our youth so they have a chance in life,"" she says. ""Whenever you're frustrated and you feel like you don't have a future or you can't get a job, then you're more susceptible to be influenced by terrorism and extremist ideology.""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Volunteering with local law enforcement, Shaquille O'Neal has learned from his peers that domestic violence calls are among the most dangerous for police officers. NBA star Shaquille O'Neal praises Karen Earl for her efforts on behalf of domestic abuse victims. ""[It's] a very disturbing thing,"" said the NBA star, who has dealt mainly with children's cases. ""I don't really think a lot of women know what to do."" That's where Karen Earl comes in. As executive director of the Jenesse Center, the oldest domestic violence intervention program in south central Los Angeles, California, Earl is a ""tireless and fearless"" champion of women and children living in abusive situations, O'Neal said. The Phoenix Suns center called Earl ""the pillow of women's society."" For more than two decades, Earl has helped give victims a way out through the Jenesse Center, which provides shelter, education, outreach and legal services to more than 8,500 victims of domestic violence every year. ""Thank God for Miss Earl,"" O'Neal said. ""She takes women that have been involved in domestic abuse situations and gives them a place to come rest their head."" According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, an estimated 1.3 million women are victims of physical assault by an intimate partner each year, and one in four women will experience domestic violence in her lifetime. Earl has heard countless stories of domestic abuse and has seen a range of tipping points before victims seek help. She is working to lower these statistics. She recalled one woman whose husband beat her with an iron; for another, ""the beatings were standard, but when he sold their refrigerator and she couldn't keep her baby's milk cold anymore, she knew it was time to go."" These women were able to find shelter and support -- and ultimately safety and success -- through the Jenesse Center. ""It is not normal to go to bed afraid,"" Earl said. ""And the thing that I know for sure is that there is help."" When Earl began volunteering at the center in 1986, she said, she often thought of what her own mother went through. ""I remember us having to run out of the house at midnight with sheets wrapped around us. I know the impact it had on my mom, and of course the impact on me and my siblings,"" she said. ""I wish there were a place back then, but nobody talked about it. It was just family business; it was personal.""  Watch Earl discuss the center's mission to heal through art » . Today, Earl serves as Jenesse Center's executive director and calls her work with staff, fundraising and volunteer recruitment ""a 24-hour thing."" The process of healing for victims generally starts with a phone call to the center's hot line, she said. The center provides counseling and literature and has a 30-day emergency shelter for women and their families. Earl said this emergency period ""is a time of regrouping"" and lets the women know that they're not alone and that they didn't do anything wrong. The center also provides long-term support. ""Women and their children can stay for two years,"" Earl said. ""Every able body, every day, gets up and takes classes. And when they're not taking classes, they're looking for employment, going through counseling sessions or [getting] legal assistance."" For Earl, comprehensive care through a team approach is the key to the center's success. She said she has seen women at the center earn graduate degrees and become ""full-fledge"" professionals -- and that changing lives is what keeps her going. O'Neal said the center helps point women in the right direction and gives them the chance to overcome adversity. ""They'll help you get an apartment. They'll help you get a job. They help you get back on your feet and become the beautiful woman that you are.""","O'Neal's work in law enforcement taught him the serious nature of domestic violence .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The A&E network quickly backed away from an earlier assurance that Michael Jackson's three children ""are not part of"" a reality show it is taping with four of the pop star's brothers. Before their father's death, Michael Jackson's children, Paris, Prince and ""Blanket"" were not often seen in public. The network said late Wednesday it was ""entirely possible"" that ""other members of the Jackson family"" could appear on the show, but it is too soon to know. US Weekly magazine quoted an unidentified source as saying that  despite a sharp division in the Jackson family over the matter, Prince, 12, Paris, 11, and Blanket, 7, would be included in the show. ""The Jacksons: A Family Dynasty,"" which focuses on the lives of four of the Jackson brothers -- Jackie, Jermaine, Tito and Marlon -- was in the works before the singer's June 25 death. ""Filming is taking place right now,"" A&E said in the late Wednesday statement. ""As production moves forward, it is entirely possible that the brothers' paths will intersect with other members of the Jackson family, who may or may not be included in the finished series. However, we cannot at this point definitively know who else may make an appearance in the series."" Earlier Wednesday, however, the network had seemed to rule out their appearance, saying, ""They are not part of the series."" Jackson went to great lengths for years to keep his children out of the public eye, including covering their faces with masks and scarves. It was only at the public memorial service for Jackson that the world got a close look at them -- and began learning about their personalities. The magazine's source is quoted as saying that the oldest Jackson sister, Rebbie, ""feels Michael would spin in his grave if he knew his kids would be on this show."" The public relations firm hired by the Jackson family soon after Michael Jackson's death issued a short statement Wednesday morning that did not dispute the US Weekly report. ""We are not going to comment,"" the statement said. The decision would be left to Katherine Jackson, Michael's mother, according to the lawyer appointed in August to represent the children in the probate of their father's will.  Katherine Jackson was given guardianship over the children by a Los Angeles judge. The reality show is tentatively set to begin airing in December. CNN's Marc Balinsky contributed to this report.","A&E to broadcast reality show featuring some of Michael Jackson's family .

"(CNN) -- Marjorye Heeney knew something was wrong when she saw a bulging cloud of black dust darken the sky. Drought-like conditions dried this Kern River bed last year near Bakersfield, California. She then heard an eerie, train-like whistle as fierce winds rattled her front door and windows. When she looked outside, hordes of grasshoppers and crows swarmed over her father's barren farm. After the storm broke, her father walked outside and muttered curses as he scanned the horizon for rain clouds. ""I can remember my dad just watching the sky so closely,"" Heeney says. ""A sprinkle would excite him so much."" That's how Heeney, now 83, describes growing up on an Oklahoma farm during the Dust Bowl storms in the 1930s. For much of that decade, ""black blizzards"" -- formed by a prolonged drought and poor farming techniques -- ravaged much of the nation. Now a new generation of Americans is again anxiously looking to the sky. Drought has returned to the United States, and some warn that more tough days are ahead. The value of water is starting to become apparent in America. Over the past three years a drought has affected large swaths of the country, and conflicts over water usage may become commonplace in the future, climatologists say. ""Our focus is oil, but the critical need for water is going to make water the most significant natural resource that we're going to have to worry about in the future,"" says Larry Fillmer, executive director of the Natural Resources Management & Development Institute at Auburn University in Alabama. At least 36 states expect to face water shortages within the next five years, according to a report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. According to the National Drought Mitigation Center, several regions in particular have been hit hard: the Southeast, Southwest and the West. Texas, Georgia and South Carolina have suffered the worst droughts this year, the agency said. Yet most people don't need scientists to tell them there's a water shortage. Plenty of cities have implemented water bans while state squabbles over water usage are common in some regions. What may surprise people, though, are the causes for the recent drought. It's not global warming, some climatologists say. The droughts are caused by rapid population growth and unwise agricultural choices. John R. Christy, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, says the last three years have been drier than usual in many parts of the United States, but overall there's been no shortage of rainfall. He says the U.S. mainland experienced worse droughts in the 12th and 16th centuries. ""The demand for water has gone up,"" Christy says. ""The demand has skyrocketed in places like California and New Mexico because they've tried to grow crops in deserts."" Even drought conditions in the Southeast can't be blamed on a shortage of rainfall, Christy says. The region's water delivery systems can't keep pace with the growth, he says. ""The rain is still falling, but you're out of water because the storage facilities are not big enough,"" Christy says. There's also a public perception that ordinary people are wasting more water, but that's not true, says Mark Svoboda, a climatologist with the National Drought Mitigation Center. ""Per capita use of water is down because we're learning to be more efficient,"" Svoboda says. Water shortages don't have to remain a fact of modern life, drought experts say. Many offer the same solutions: Build better water delivery systems to accommodate population growth, develop more efficient uses of irrigation, and shift agriculture from the West to the East where it's easier and cheaper to water crops. Svoboda believes a change in attitude is even more vital than changing habits. ""We take water for granted,"" he says. ""We think it's a cheap commodity that's always going to be there."" Heeney, the Dust Bowl survivor, doesn't appear to need that lesson. She remembers how precious water was in the 1930s when people fetched water in buckets. And when the rains finally ended the Dust Bowl, she vividly remembers her joyous father driving his family out into his fields just to watch the water settle into the soil. Heeney, who now lives in Topeka, Kansas, gets upset when she sees people throw away bottled water or use too much water to wash their cars. ""We don't value water and we're going to regret it,"" Heeney says. ""We forget. We're as dumb as we can be and we don't learn.""","Over the past three years a drought has affected large swaths of the U.S.

"(CNN) -- The head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization said Saturday that U.N. nuclear experts can inspect a uranium enrichment plant, according to a report from Iran-funded Press TV. Iranian soldiers are shown in the uranium enrichment facility in Natanz, 300 kms south of Tehran, in 2006. Ali Akbar Salehi said officials are trying to settle on a date for the inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency. GeoEye, a U.S.-based satellite imagery company, released two photos dated Saturday from what it says is the second facility. The image shows quarry equipment, a surface-to-air missile site, and more construction equipment surrounding a mountain, according to image analysis by IHS Jane's, an intelligence firm. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Friday that Iran was building a second uranium enrichment facility near the Shia Muslim city of Qom, about 100 miles southwest of Tehran. He said the plant won't be operational for about 18 months. Ahmadinejad told reporters Friday that Iran had met IAEA requirements by informing it about the plant at least six months before it is slated to begin operating.  Watch Ahmadinejad hit back at Obama » . The watchdog agency confirmed that it received a letter Monday from Iran revealing the existence of the underground facility on a military base. Iran told the IAEA there is no nuclear material at the site, an agency spokesman said. Iran has denied its goal is to develop nuclear weapons, a concern of the United States and other Western nations. Esmail Kowsari, a senior Iranian lawmaker, said Iran's need for nuclear fuel is outpacing the limited amount of uranium it can enrich at its only other plant in Natanz. But Iran's activities, along with its anti-Western and anti-Israel rhetoric, have troubled international powers working to stop the development of an Iranian nuclear program. The country's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said it is planning to stage ""massive missile exercises"" or war games on Sunday to promote the armed forces' ""deterrent power,"" the semi-official Fars News Agency reported. The tests are code named ""Payambar-e Azam 4, or ""The Great Messenger,"" the corps said in its announcement. Iran's announcement came ahead of a planned meeting October 1 between it and the five permanent United Nations Security Council members, plus Germany. Leaders from the United States, France and Britain made a joint announcement, accusing Iran of violating international agreements by keeping the construction plan a secret. ""This is a serious challenge to the global non-proliferation regime and continues a disturbing pattern of Iranian evasion,"" President Obama said Saturday in his weekly radio address. ""That is why international negotiations with Iran scheduled for October 1 now take on added urgency,"" he said. ""My offer of a serious, meaningful dialogue to resolve this issue remains open. But Iran must now cooperate fully with the International Atomic Energy Agency and take action to demonstrate its peaceful intentions."" Ali Asghar Soltanieh, Iran's ambassador to the IAEA, told Press TV Saturday that Iran is ""very disappointed with the hasty, unjustified hostile reaction yesterday by three leaders."" He was referring to Obama, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown.  Watch world leaders react to Iran » . ""What I suspect is a hidden agenda, which is going to jeopardize our excellent cooperation with the IAEA, and perhaps long-term jeopardize the integrity and credibility of the IAEA,"" he said. ""We are working with the agency in a very technical and smooth manner to arrange the inspection to the site."" Other Iranians also reacted to the criticism over the new plant. iReport.com: Dissidents discuss Iran enrichment plants . ""God willing, this plant will be put into operation soon, and will blind the eyes of the enemies,"" Fars reported Saturday, quoting a senior Iranian official. The senior official, Hojjatoleslam Mohammad Mohammadi Golpayegani, heads the office of the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Also Saturday, the Web site of the Iran Student News Agency carried comments from an Iranian legislator who warned Western nations not to make Iran regret its cooperation with the IAEA. ""Western countries and the U.S. must not make Iran regret its cooperation with the IAEA beyond its legal obligations,"" said Alaeddin Boroujerdi, chief of the Iran Parliament Commission for National Security and Foreign Policy. He said Western criticism of Iran's new facility is an ""illogical and unrealistic"" smear campaign.

"CHAMBLEE, Georgia (CNN) -- Janet McBride had to send someone to fetch lunch for her Saturday. The cheerful auto dealer receptionist didn't dare leave her switchboard during the waning hours of the federal government's ""Cash for Clunkers"" program. Car shoppers browse a Honda showroom Saturday morning in Marietta, Georgia. ""Our phones have been ringing off the hook,"" said a giddy Pete Richards, general manager of Ed Voyles Honda in Marietta, Georgia. ""... It's been great. Phenomenal."" McBride was compiling a list of customers for swamped salespeople to call back. ""I try to keep it under control,"" McBride said. ""I think we need one of those number things -- 'Now serving Number 5.'"" As of 11 a.m. Saturday, the Honda dealership just north of Atlanta said it had made 108 clunker deals since the Car Allowance Rebate System program began on July 1, and Richards expected to do plenty more before closing down Sunday night.  Watch what car buyers need to know » . ""If I don't do 30 of these today, I'll be amazed,"" he said. A normal Saturday would produce about 12 sales, he said. The program has generated so much traffic and new-car buzz that even non-qualifying and used car sales have jumped, Richards said. ""We're having a ball. I haven't worked a Saturday in probably two years. But I woke up at 3 o'clock this morning. Couldn't wait to get here,"" he said. ""It's like Christmas!"" McBride added before her phone rang again. It's more like the letdown of late Christmas afternoon across town at Jim Ellis Chevrolet in Chamblee, Georgia, where General Manager Mark Frost just wants to be done with the headaches the clunkers program has caused. ""If President Obama came and sat behind a computer and saw how his program is being administered, he's crack some heads,"" Frost said. ""My impression is that he's about excellence and execution, and there's some dumbass [at the Department of Transportation] sitting there looking at this computer and rejecting deals that are perfectly good."" The 12 Atlanta-area dealerships under the Jim Ellis name had made 350 clunker deals worth almost $1.5 million in reimbursements and received payment for none, Frost said. Among those making deals was Mark Gallo, an Atlanta antiques dealer who traded in his eight-cylinder 1998 Chevy van for six-cylinder 2009 model. He received a $4,500 allowance for his clunker, which he guessed was $1,500 more than he would have gotten otherwise. The gas mileage still isn't great, ""but it's better than it was,"" Gallo said. ""And I needed a van."" He'd been thinking about trading up for a while, but the end of the program prompted him to pull the trigger. ""I thought it was going to last a lot longer than it actually did, ... but I saw that it was ending on Monday and I said, 'Oh, damn! Scramble!'"" Also scrambling to make a deal Saturday was Rick Wright of Woodstock, Georgia. The ironworker has been working in Orlando, Florida. But when his wife, bus driver Cindy Wright, traded in their 1998 Chevy Tahoe for an '09 Traverse, he needed to be there in person to show his driver's license and sign over the title. ""I'm working out of town at the present time, so she calls me up and says, 'Hey, they're going to cut this off at 1 o'clock. Do you want the car?' And I said, 'Let's go for it,'"" said Rick Wright, who made the seven-hour drive in time to sign the deal around 10 a.m. Saturday. ""That was the only way we could get it done."" While the government says the program continues through the end of business Sunday, Frost decreed that the last deal at the Jim Ellis dealerships had to be made by noon Saturday and the paperwork submitted by 1 p.m. in anticipation of continued problems with the CARS submission process. ""It's the paperwork that's the biggest pain in the neck,"" said Jim Ellis salesman Neil Krieger, who sold Gallo his van. Salespeople have been working long hours and making big commissions at both dealerships. ""It's been good for me. Oh yeah,"" the Wrights' salesman, who goes by the single name Kya, said. It's a matter of delayed gratification for the dealers, who will have to wait for the government to sort through the mountainous heap of applications, approve the deals and issue $3 billion in reimbursement. ""This could be devastating for dealers if they don't get this going and do this right,"" Frost said. ""A month from now, if all of our deals get paid, then Obama's my hero,"" he said. ""If, in a month from now, if we still have ... $200,000 that we're not getting paid, it's a disaster."" Frost worries too much, Honda dealer Richards said. ""We're going to get our money,"" he said. ""We're making sure the deals are straight. If everybody's got their documentation right, they've got the buy of lifetime."" Despite his concerns, Frost tried to remain optimistic in the program's final hours. After all, his dealership's sales are up 30 percent from last year, he said. ""People are coming in,"" he said not long after opening Saturday. ""I smell clunker.""","Customers rush in for final weekend of ""Cash for Clunkers"" program .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN)  -- As Christmas season went into full swing this year, Glen Fullmer's 7-year-old son came home from school with an assignment: Make a poster illustrating his family holiday traditions. The boy wasn't sure how to proceed because he and his family are Baha'is, not Christians, and they have no holidays during the Christmas season. Thus, Fullmer encountered the ""December Dilemma"" -- the term used for the quandaries and anxieties non-Christians and interfaith couples face during Christmas season. Fullmer, a Baha'i faith spokesman who lives in Evanston, Illinois, said he saw the poster assignment as a ""teachable moment"" for his 4-, 7- and 10-year-old sons who associated holiday traditions with Christmas. He reminded his boys that Baha'is have a gift-giving and charity period in February called Ayyam-i-Ha, a stretch of time not unlike the Christmas season. And he helped his son design the poster about that holiday, which precedes a fasting period and then the Baha'i New Year in March. ""His classmates asked him questions about the holiday, and one of his friends came up to him and wants to celebrate that holiday,"" Fullmer said, pleased that his son's peers helped him reaffirm his identity. Navigating the Christmas season can be a challenge for the millions of people who don't celebrate the holiday. Many acknowledge and sometime embrace the season's customs, such as gift-giving and sending out greeting cards, while at the same time they are conscious of maintaining their own religious identities. ""They strongly try to maintain their own integrity, but they really want to find bridges across holidays,"" said the Rev. Dr. Paul Numrich, a professor at the Theological Consortium of Greater Columbus in Ohio. ""I think that's the majority."" L.S. Narasimhan, chairman of the Georgia Indo-American Chamber of Commerce, is a Hindu and doesn't celebrate Christmas. But he said he admires the Christian celebrations of his friends and has attended Christmas Eve services at several churches. ""Hindus are typically more open-minded and tolerant. Hinduism is very comfortable in accommodating a diversity of ideas,"" he said. ""It is very common for Hindu families to have Christmas trees at their homes, purely as a fun thing to do for their children. When they visit shopping malls, Hindu parents in general are comfortable with a photo-op for their little kids with Santa."" But at the same time, there are pressures about the encroachment of Christianity on Hindu life. ""Television commercials, good selection of merchandise and great sale prices persuade Hindu-Americans to take advantage of the shopping spree,"" Narasimhan said. ""Several Hindu temples have risen up to the challenge and added some special Hindu prayers and ceremonies to engage Hindus who are on winter holidays but not on overseas vacations."" Dr. Shefali Chheda, an Atlanta-area pediatrician, is a Jain -- practicing a religion with Indian roots. Growing up in Houston, Texas, she said her parents ""felt comfortable letting us celebrate Christmas,"" perhaps to help fit into American society and maintain a sense of normalcy. ""The spirit and meaning of Christmas, of helping others and of giving, are nice messages. Therefore, it is hard to consciously object to it,"" Chheda said. ""Jains, as a whole, are a minority in India. Many Jains celebrate Hindu holidays, so celebrating Christmas with Santa and a tree and presents is no different. Since Jains wholeheartedly believe in 'ahimsa' -- peace toward all living beings in thought, word and action -- the Christmas spirit is a very Jain-like philosophy."" The religious aspect of Christmas -- believing Jesus is the savior and that December 25 is his birthday -- is not celebrated in Jainism, but the customs and symbols are interwoven into daily life, she said. ""Now that I have toddlers in the house, they come home with stories about Christmas. They sing songs about Rudolph and Santa, and Kwanzaa, and Hanukkah. But it's Santa that everyone talks about, so they talk about him as well,"" Chheda said. ""I use Santa as a behavioral modification tool. 'Santa's watching you, so you better be good' works infinitely better than timeout. My kids will be living in this country; they will have a hard enough time anyway with their names and food and other cultural traditions; Christmas -- and the Christmas spirit -- is not one tradition that I want to take away from them."" Jesus plays a role in the theology of other religions, such as the Baha'i faith and Islam, even though those faiths don't observe Christmas as a religious holiday. The Christmas season presented a struggle for Haris Tarin, director of the Washington office of the Muslim Public Affairs Committee. He grew up in Los Angeles, California, area schools, where he sang the ever-present Christmas carols and made the gingerbread houses in schools but didn't have a tree in his home. ""We definitely had a little bit of anxiety in childhood,"" Tarin said. But that changed as he grew up and refined his American Muslim persona amid the American atmosphere of diversity and tolerance. Now, where he and his family live in northern Virginia, ""we don't celebrate Christmas. We celebrate our holidays"" -- pointing, for example, to Eid al-Fitr after Ramadan and Eid al-Adha after the hajj pilgrimage. But he welcomes the goodwill of the season -- the gift-exchanges with non-Muslim neighbors and the requests from schoolteachers to talk about Muslim holidays. ""There's definitely going to be a level of discomfort, especially for those who aren't used to that diverse culture that we belong to,"" he said. But the unease spawns discussion, presenting a useful opportunity to help young people and newcomers, he said. For Jews, the eight-day holiday of Hanukkah happens to fall during the Christmas season. Hanukkah is wildly popular and observed, with its special foods, gift-giving and candle lighting, and with its symbols such as the menorah -- a candelabrum -- and the dreidel, a toy that spins like a top. Compared with other non-Christians, many Jews have drawn a sharper line in the sand when it comes to observing Christmas, a stance informed by historic, theological and self-preservation reasons. That attitude emerged recently during a young professionals' get-together at an Indian restaurant outside Atlanta sponsored by the American Jewish Committee and Young Indian Professionals. People there indicated that attending Christmas-themed holiday parties, exchanging greeting cards and wishing Christian friends ""Merry Christmas"" are surely not uncommon or unacceptable among Jews. But some practices are widely shunned -- such as plunking one's child on Santa's lap at the mall, and deplored -- such as assigning kids in public schools to write a letter to Santa Claus. ""It's a beautiful season. It brings out a joy,"" said Hannah Vahaba, who organized the Jewish-Indian event. ""But I'm not going to celebrate it."" Interfaith couples celebrate their diversity during the Christmas season. Jeff Silver, a certified public accountant who is Jewish, and Shweta Gupta, a dentist who is Hindu, are planning their marriage next year. They will have an interfaith household and said they hope to raise children to understand both of their traditions. At their home in Atlanta, they've set up a holiday tree decorated with Hindu and Jewish ornaments. Non-religious Americans embrace a December ""secular holiday"" called HumanLight. Patrick Colucci, vice chair of the HumanLight Committee and member of the New Jersey Humanist Network, said the holiday can uplift ""atheist, humanist and nonreligious"" people who feel left out and isolated during Christmas. It was a perfect fit for him when it came along, he said, because ""it corresponds with my humanity-based ethics and values, without any supernatural or theistic beliefs. My 'holiday season' is HumanLight and New Year's Eve -- that's what I celebrate."" ""The only dilemma, in my experience is, if Christmas is part of the larger family tradition, and then some family members reject us for not believing in it anymore. We're not out to take Christmas away from anyone who wants to celebrate it -- there is no 'war on Christmas,' "" Colucci said. How do Christians themselves see the presence and practices of non-Christians during Christmas? While many would like to see non-Christians convert to Christianity, they also recognize that the United States is a ""diverse society"" and that conversion ""is not even on their radar screen,"" said Numrich, the theology professor. ""There's a deep American virtue in respecting religious differences,"" he said.","Non-Christians and interfaith couples often face quandaries and anxieties during holidays .

"(CNN)  -- Stonehenge, an enigma to visitors and scientists alike for so many years, became less of a mystery after a discovery announced to the world this week. A stone circle discovered near Stonehenge may suggest the prehistoric monument was part of a funeral route. Archaeologists have unearthed a new stone circle near Stonehenge that lends credence to the theory that the famous prehistoric monument in Britain was part of a funeral complex. University of Bristol archaeologist Joshua Pollard described the new find as ""incredible"" because it establishes Stonehenge as part of a larger ceremonial complex linked to the nearby River Avon. ""No one could have predicted there was another stone circle so close by,"" said Pollard, co-director of the excavation project that began in 2004. This, he said, changes the perception of the popular tourist destination 90 miles west of London. The new find, dubbed ""Bluestonehenge"" after the color of the 25 Welsh stones of which it was once composed, sits along the Avon a mile away from its famous sister circle, Pollard said. Neolithic peoples would have come down river by boat and literally stepped off into Bluestonehenge, Pollard said. They may have congregated at certain times of the year, including the winter solstice, and carried remains of the dead from Bluestonehenge down an almost two-mile funeral processional route to a cemetery at Stonehenge to bury them. ""It could be that Bluestonehenge was where the dead began their final journey to Stonehenge,"" said Mike Parker Pearson, an archaeologist at the University of Sheffield who co-directed the project with Pollard. ""Not many people know that Stonehenge was Britain's largest burial ground at that time,"" he said. ""Maybe the blue stone circle is where people were cremated before their ashes were buried at Stonehenge itself."" Proof of life artifacts -- pottery, animal bones, food residues and flint tools used in the Stone Age -- are decidedly absent at Stonehenge but were found upstream in a village discovered by the excavation team in 2005, leading researchers to believe that Stonehenge was indeed a burial ground. But people have debated the purpose of Stonehenge for decades. Known for its orientation in relation to the rising and setting sun, the circle of stones represented a prehistoric temple to some. Others argued it was an astronomical observatory. Or that it was a marker of time. But Pollard is sticking to his theory. He said others have not based their suppositions on archaeological finds. Archaeologists began the latest excavation with the hope of tracking the course of the avenue that led to Stonehenge. They had no idea they would stumble upon a second circle that would help uncover the mystery of Stonehenge. The stones at Bluestonehenge were removed thousands of years ago, Pollard said, but the sizes of the remaining pits, about 33 feet in diameter, point to giant blue stones from the Preseli Mountains of Wales, about 150 miles away. Pollard said that Neolithic people dragged the pillarlike blue stones along the processional route to Stonehenge to incorporate them in a major rebuilding that took place around 2500 B.C. Archaeologists know that after 2500, Stonehenge consisted of about 60 Welsh stones and 83 local sarsen stones. Some of the blue stones that once stood on the river's edge probably now stand within the center of Stonehenge, Pollard said. Scientists plan to use radiocarbon dating techniques to better understand the history of the entire site. Stonehenge remains as striking as ever. But with each new find, the enigma fades just a little.","Discovery of lost stone circle sheds new light on Stonehenge's purpose .

"(CNN) -- The powerful Service Employees International Union has decided that, because of the $700 billion financial-system bailout, it wants to organize bank workers. Banks that get taxpayer money need to ""ensure their workers have a voice,"" a union spokeswoman says. In an e-mail dated November 12 and obtained exclusively by CNN, a member of SEIU's Private Equity Project outlined initial discussions to organize bank workers ""since the banking industry is now being infused with billions of taxpayer dollars."" The e-mail was written by SEIU's Inga Skippings to the director of the Washington office of the Association of Community Organizing for Reform Now (ACORN), a longtime ally and partner of the union. ""We need to get a handle on who these workers are, working conditions, etc.,"" Skippings wrote. ""Do you have ACORN members who work for banks or Freddie Mac/Fannie Mae? Is there anyway [sic] you could check? The banks we're most concerned about are: . -- Fannie Mae  -- Freddie Mac  -- Chevy Chase/B.F.Saul  -- BB&T  -- SunTrust  -- Bank of America/Countrywide  -- Wachovia/Wells Fargo  -- PNC Bank/National City  -- Citigroup . ""Please let me know and if you have other suggestions, I'd love to hear them."" Skippings referred questions to a union spokeswoman, who confirmed the authenticity of the e-mail and that the union is considering targeting the banks for unionizing. ""We believe there is special responsibility for companies who receive taxpayer dollars to ensure their workers have a voice on the job,"" SEIU's Lynda Tran said. ""And those workers should have a seat at the table at the companies where decisions that impact the future of their families and the companies that employ them"" are made. ""We are talking to workers really broadly in banking,"" she said. SEIU is the fastest-growing trade union in North America, according to its own Web site, with a membership of more than 2 million, including health-care industry workers and state and local government employees. It also represents guards and janitors who work in commercial and residential properties. And its clout continues to grow. SEIU's $85 million in political donations made it the single-largest contributor to either party in the recent elections. The union worked vigorously for the election of Barack Obama, who has named a former union official as his White House political director, a post once held in the Bush administration by Karl Rove. The official, Patrick Gaspard, formerly was executive vice president of politics and legislation for Local 1199, the SEIU's United Healthcare Workers East. SEIU, which broke away from the AFL-CIO in 2005, is known for its successful but sometimes controversial tactics: It often targets private equity groups' leaders, as well as banks and companies, with loud and demonstrative rallies. The union's hierarchy has made no secret it hopes to grow under the incoming Democratic administration. ""I would say that we've been very vocal about the optimism about the new administration,"" SEIU's Tran said. ""There are a number of newly elected members of Congress who agree with us on matters relating to working families."" One labor professor said SEIU's timing in trying to unionize bank workers may be on target ""because financial institutions are at a moment of weakness."" ""Low-wage earners are the growing sector of the work force,"" said Gregory DeFreitas, an economics professor at Hofstra University and director of its labor studies program. ""This is a very shrewd political move to tie this to the bailouts."" DeFreitas said unions tend not to do well in attracting workers during economic recessions because jobs are scarce then. But he said recent surveys indicate a majority of workers would consider organizing, so the public's appetite for unions may be on the upswing. ""Bank teller jobs are one of the few jobs that are actually growing,"" DeFreitas said. ""And they are low-wage earners, so it makes sense that it fits into the SEIU model. SEIU has been very opportunistic in growing its membership. Success breeds success."" The median annual earnings of bank tellers was about $22,000 in May 2006, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. A spokesman for the American Bankers Association said it had no one who could comment on labor issues. He said the association represents 95 percent of the industry's $13.6 trillion in assets.","Union says it is considering targeting banks for unionizing .

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Saturday he sees no change in U.S. policy toward Iran despite the U.S. promise of a ""new beginning."" Ayatollah Khamenei said Iran would change its policy when the U.S. did so as well. Khamenei said a change in rhetoric is not enough, and Washington must practice what it preaches, according to the English-language Press TV channel in Iran. He also promised that Iran will change its policy if the United States does so as well, Press TV reported. Khamenei's comments, which he made in a televised address to mark the start of the Iranian New Year on Friday, come a day after U.S. President Barack Obama reached out to Iran in a videotaped message. A spokesman for Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad condemned U.S. foreign policy Friday in response to the video. Obama's message spoke of ""new beginnings"" with the promise of a new year. ""My administration is now committed to diplomacy that addresses the full range of issues before us, and to pursuing constructive ties among the United States, Iran and the international community,"" the president said in his message Friday. Obama said the United States seeks engagement with Iran that is ""honest and grounded in mutual respect."" The president's message is part of a dramatic shift in tone from that of the Bush administration, which branded Iran as part of an ""axis of evil"" along with North Korea and Iraq. It also echoes Obama's inaugural speech in which he told the Muslim world, ""We seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect."" Ahmadinejad said last month that Iran would welcome talks with the United States ""in a fair atmosphere with mutual respect."" Khamenei also said world powers have come to realize they are not able to block Iran's nuclear progress. He looked back on the February 25 testing of Iran's first nuclear power plant, at Bushehr, as one of the ""joyful developments"" of the past year. Last month, the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security released a report saying that Iran has reached ""nuclear weapons breakout capability"" -- it has enough uranium to make a nuclear bomb. The report was based on an analysis of data from the International Atomic Energy Agency. However, an IAEA official who asked not to be named cautioned against drawing such dramatic conclusions from the data, saying Iran's stock of low-enriched uranium would have to be turned into highly enriched uranium to be weapons-grade material. That hasn't been done, the official said. The United States has had tortuous relations with Tehran since the Islamic revolution in 1979. Meanwhile, the widow of the late founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, died Saturday morning after a long period of illness, the Iranian-run Islamic Republic News Agency said. A funeral for Khadije Saghafi was scheduled to be held Sunday in Tehran and she was set to be laid to rest in Khomeini's tomb, the agency reported. Khomeini was the leader of the 1979 revolution that led to the toppling of the shah of Iran and the ushering in of an Islamic state. He died in 1989.","Iranian supreme leader: No change in U.S. policy despite Obama overtures .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- A motorcycle bomb killed 20 people and injured 117 others south of Baghdad on Wednesday, the Interior Ministry said. The bombing in the holy city of Karbala was one of four attacks targeting Shiite pilgrims as they headed toward the shrine of Imam Hussein on Wednesday morning, a ministry official said. Three people died and 23 were injured in the other attacks. In those explosions, a roadside bomb in western Baghdad killed one person, and a roadside bomb in the city of Hilla in Babil province, south of Baghdad, killed two people. A roadside bomb in southwestern Baghdad caused only injuries. Wednesday's attacks came two days after a suicide bomber killed 41 people and wounded 106 others in an assault on pilgrims in northeastern Baghdad. Iraqi authorities are trying to provide security to thousands of Shiite worshipers who are making their way to Karbala to mark the Arbaeen -- the end of the 40-day mourning period at the close of Ashura. Ashura commemorates the martyrdom of Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed who was killed in battle in Karbala in 680 A.D. That event helped create the schism between Sunnis and Shiites, the two main Muslim religious movements. CNN's Yousif Bassil contributed to this report.","Bombers target Shiite pilgrims in the holy city of Karbala .

"(CNN) -- The bad news came via certified letter to Norma Jimenez, Edna Rodriguez and nearly 17,000 other Puerto Ricans this month. Thousands last week protest government layoffs in Puerto Rico. To cut spending, Puerto Rico announced last month that thousands of government employees would be fired in the second round of layoffs this year. More than 7,800 public employees were fired in March. ""I was fearful because of the uncertainty,"" Jimenez, 42, an auxiliary administrator for the U.S. territory's Department of Education told CNN. ""Will the letter come or not come?"" The letter came, and it said that under a measure authorized by an emergency fiscal bill, her last day of work would be January 8 of next year. Rodriguez, who worked for the education department for 11 years as a receptionist, got the same letter, but with a November 6 termination date. ""It was as if the world collapsed,"" she told CNN. And presumably, so it goes for the thousands of other public employees who were laid off. The austere measures are a bid by the government to stabilize a fiscal mess and save Puerto Rico's credit rating. According to government figures, the U.S. territory faces a $3.2 billion budget deficit -- proportionally, the largest shortfall in the United States -- and is entering a fourth year of recession. The severity of the plan reflects the aftermath of what experts say is years, maybe decades, of the lack of a forward-looking economic policy. Confronted with the fear that the credit-rating agencies might reduce Puerto Rico's rating to junk status, the administration of Gov. Luis Fortuno has taken strong, but controversial, steps. ""Every layoff letter has a name, and every name has a story,"" Puerto Rico Secretary of State Kenneth McClintock said in an interview with CNN. But, he said, ""Doing nothing was not an alternative."" The governor and other officials cut their salaries and trimmed spending in other areas, but the massive layoffs were necessary to avert the downgraded credit rating, McClintock said. ""If that happened, we would become the first state in the history of the U.S. to have its credit downgraded to junk bond,"" he said. Puerto Rico's unemployment rate is nearly 16 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. According to government calculations, a downgraded credit rating would have pushed that figure toward 25 percent unemployment, McClintock said. The government is betting that the reduced spending, combined with $6.5 billion in combined federal and local stimulus funds, will be enough to get the territory back on solid footing. As a U.S. commonwealth, Puerto Rico exercises much autonomy, but still falls under U.S. jurisdiction. In addition to the federal stimulus money, Puerto Rican officials traveled to Washington last month to lobby for discretionary stimulus grants. How did Puerto Rico get into this predicament? ""This did not happen overnight,"" said Miguel Soto-Class, executive director of the Center for the New Economy, an independent think tank in Puerto Rico. For too long, the island has been dependent on a single industry at a time, Soto-Class told CNN. First it was coffee, then sugar, and most recently pharmaceutical production plants. Under the terms of a special tax break, U.S. companies were exempt from paying federal income tax on profits earned by their Puerto Rican manufacturing subsidiaries. This brought plenty of companies and jobs to the island until Congress voted to phase out the benefits between 1996 and 2006. When a number of foreign companies began to pull back, Puerto Rico saw that the local economy had not absorbed many benefits from the foreign plants, Soto-Class said. For instance, local restaurants didn't sprout near the plants because food was usually done in-house. Likewise, the foreign companies used their own accountants, leaving local CPAs few opportunities to grow. ""That wasn't the cause, but it laid bare that we hadn't had an economic development model in a long time,"" Soto-Class said. On the fiscal front, most the attention has focused on the large public workforce. With a workforce of some 200,000, Puerto Rico, with a population of about 4 million, has more public employees than any state in the union, with the exception of California and New York, McClintock said. For comparison, California has about one state employee for every 103 residents, while Puerto Rico has one public worker for every 20 residents. The public payroll had become bloated, he said. Edwin Melendez, director of the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College, said that a large public workforce is not a bad thing, as long as it adds and keeps up to the territory's growth. But even when Puerto Rico's economy started declining, the public sector continued to swell. The territory's political parties had become dependent on government employment as a political tool, in effect creating a patronage system, Melendez said. ""We are where we are because the patronage system is bankrupt,"" he said. For Fortuno, a member of Puerto Rico's pro-statehood New Progressive Party and also member of the Republican Party, the challenges required immediate action. ""You can bring it down to a four word phrase: 'No pain, no gain,' "" McClintock said. The government has already spent more than $1 billion in stimulus funds that have created some 10,000 private sector jobs, he said. ""That's why we are stimulating the private sector to grow, so that it can pick up the slack that the government can no longer afford to employ on its own,"" McClintock said. Thousands of protesters who participated in a strike last week dispute that firing this many workers during a recession will help the territory. ""This worsens the situation by increasing unemployment,"" Roberto Pagan, president of the Puerto Rico Worker's Union, told CNN. ""We want the government to take alternative measures."" The government's bet is that the negative impact of the laid off workers will be offset with positive effects of the stimulus funds, Soto-Class said. It's a risky bet, he said, adding that the Fortuno administration grasps the economics of the situation very well. Looking to the future, McClintock said the government expects to balance the budget in two years. Soto-Class said that recovery will also mean looking at diversifying the economic activity. Tourism and agriculture, for example, could become larger factors in the economy, he said. Pagan, the union leader, said he supports levying higher corporate taxes to increase revenue. The government, however, said it plans to continue to use tax incentives to lure companies to the island. Puerto Rico is ""still the pharmaceutical capital of the world, but we have to try to manufacture even more Tylenol to resolve our economic headaches,"" McClintock said. ""We have to manufacture even more Viagra than we already manufacture so our economic statistics will rise.""","Puerto Rico announced last month thousands of government layoffs .

"(CNN) -- Such is the level of pressure heaped on football managers, it is unsurprising that now and then they might say or do something that gets them into trouble with someone. The latest incident has seen Manchester City boss Mark Hughes accusing Arsenal's Arsene Wenger of ""not knowing how to behave"" after the Frenchman refused to shake the Welshman's hand after the Gunners' 3-0 English League Cup defeat on Wednesday night. It is not the first time Wenger has made the headlines for the wrong reasons, but he is certainly not alone. Fanzone takes a look at football's top-five misbehaving managers. 1. Arsene Wenger . In recent years, Wenger has been involved in touchline confrontations with Tottenham Hotspur counterpart Martin Jol and West Ham's Alan Pardew, and exchanged words with Jose Mourinho. But his most bitter rivalry has been with Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson. For about a decade, the two clubs contested for the English Premier League, with the two coaches engaged in a volatile war of words. The rivalry reached a peak in 2004 when United ended Arsenal's 49-game unbeaten streak with a 2-0 win at Old Trafford. After the match both coaches and players exchanged words before a slice of pizza was allegedly flung into Ferguson's face -- the incident has been referred to as 'Pizzagate' or the 'Battle of the Buffet' ever since. Tensions have since subsided. 2. Alex Ferguson . Ferguson's mind games over the past year have mostly been reserved for Liverpool's Rafa Benitez and referees. It was a stinging criticism of the latter that has arguably caused the Premier League's biggest controversy this season. After Manchester United grabbed a late equalizer at home to Sunderland, Ferguson in his post-match press conference proceeded to label referee Alan Wiley unfit in comparison to continental officials. After the threat of a lawsuit, Ferguson offered an apology -- albeit a fairly half-hearted one. 3. Luis Aragones . In his native Spain, Aragones will likely be remembered for leading the country to their first major trophy since 1964 when they won Euro 2008. Elsewhere it might be for when, in a training session in 2004, he was filmed making a racially offensive remark about Thierry Henry in an attempt to motivate the Frenchman's then Arsenal teammate Jose Antonio Reyes. The comment caused a particular storm in England, with many in the media calling for Aragones' job. He was later fined $3,425. 4. Diego Maradona . Maradona has been no stranger to controversy throughout his career, and has kept up that trend since becoming Argentina manager. In October he launched a scathing and foul-mouthed outburst at those who had criticized him during Argentina's qualifying campaign. The rant caused FIFA to ban him football for two months and fine him $24,603. 5. Jose Mourinho . For all his success in football management, Mourinho is equally well-known for his brash and cocky manner, a trait that has caused fans to love and loathe him in equal measure. His penchant for speaking his mind has seen him accuse referee Anders Frisk of consorting with then Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard at half-time during a Champions League tie (the official later retired due to the aftermath, having received death threats). Also while in charge of Chelsea, he once labeled Wenger a ""voyeur."" Less verbally, he risked the ire of Liverpool fans when he proceeded to shush them during the 2005 League Cup final after Chelsea scored. The most memorable occurrence came during the London club's 2005 Champions League quarterfinal versus Bayern Munich. Banned from the game, it was reported that Mourinho was secretly wheeled in and out of the changing-rooms in a washing basket, and that during the game he fed information to fitness coach Rui Faria through an earpiece under his hat.","Mark Hughes accuses Arsene Wenger of ""not knowing how to behave"" after a defeat .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Singer Chris Brown has recorded a song with his girlfriend, Rihanna, after charges were filed against him for allegedly assaulting her, a source close to the record's producer, Polow Da Don, said Thursday. A music producer says Rihanna recorded a duet with Chris Brown, who is accused of assaulting her.

""My heart goes out to both Chris and Rihanna for what has happened in the past,"" Da Don said in a statement. ""They are both great artists to work with, and I wish them well.""

A police statement said the incident began when Rihanna, whose full name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty, found a text message on Brown's cell phone from ""a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with,"" according to court documents released last week. Brown issued a public apology to his fans last month. ""Words cannot begin to express how sorry and saddened I am over what transpired,"" he said in a statement released by his spokesman. ""I am seeking the counseling of my pastor, my mother and other loved ones, and I am committed, with God's help, to emerging a better person.""

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- Fueled by a hefty dose of tweener love, Zac Efron's ""17 Again"" won this weekend's box office sweepstakes without breaking a sweat. Zac Efron stars in ""17 Again,"" which debuted in the No. 1 slot at the box office. The high school time-warp comedy, which costars Matthew Perry and Leslie Mann, earned $24.1 million, according to studio estimates from the box office tracking firm Nielsen EDI. The film's haul marked another No. 1 debut for Efron, who helped boost ticket sales with an appearance this weekend on Saturday Night Live. In 2007, the musical ""Hairspray,"" which co-starred Efron, opened first at $27.5 million. Last year, Efron's ""High School Musical 3: Senior Year"" bowed with $42 million, and while ""17 Again"" may have fallen short of that mark, it still represents an auspicious maiden voyage for Efron's post-Disney career. Despite the raft of critics who pooh-poohed the film, which received a 61 percent fresh rating on Rottentomatoes.com, audiences were more favorably inclined, giving it a strong A- CinemaScore. Landing at No. 2, the Russell Crowe-Ben Affleck thriller ""State of Play"" pulled in $14.1 million. The film, which garnered generally positive reviews, is the latest of a string of adult-oriented dramas to lag at the box office, although its final tally actually came in somewhat higher than anticipated and was an improvement over the $12.9 million opening for Crowe's last outing, last fall's ""Body of Lies."" While ""17 Again"" mopped up moviegoers on the younger end of the age spectrum, a whopping 75 percent of ""State of Play's"" audience was over 35. Holding steady at No. 3 for the second week in a row, ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" took in another $12.9 million. The film's impressive performance in its fourth weekend brings the grand total for the animated kiddie flick to $162 million the highest this year by a wide margin. ""Hannah Montana: The Movie"" dropped 61 percent from its opening last weekend, but the Miley Cyrus starrer still proved strong enough for the No. 4 spot with $12.7 million, boosting its cumulative gross to $56.2 million. Rounding out the top five, ""Fast & Furious"" still had plenty of gas in the tank, earning $12.3 million in its third weekend for an overall cume of $136.7 million. The same, however, can't be said for the Jason Statham action flick ""Crank High Voltage,"" which sputtered into a distant sixth place with a decidedly low-voltage $6.5 million.

"(CNN)  -- Despite his personal problems, golfer Tiger Woods received another accolade as he was voted PGA player of the year. Wood was chosen for the award by a vote from other professional golfers. ""The recognition by [his] peers is one of the highest compliments a PGA Tour member can receive,"" PGA Commissioner Timothy Finchem said in a press statement Friday. The statement mentioned the six tournaments Woods won in 2009 but made no mention of the infamous car accident and infidelity scandal that pushed the golfer to take an indefinite hiatus from pro golf. Earlier this week, Woods was also voted ""Athlete of the Decade"" by the Associated Press. Woods' woes started late in November when he crashed his car outside his Florida mansion. Authorities issued a citation for careless driving, and he was given a $164 fine. Woods was not required to talk to police about the wreck and declined to talk with investigators on several occasions. In the week following the crash, Woods apologized for ""transgressions"" that let his family down. The same day, US Weekly published a report alleging that Woods had an affair with Jaimee Grubbs, a 24-year-old cocktail waitress. US Weekly's report followed a National Enquirer article before the crash that the athlete was having an affair with New York nightclub hostess Rachel Uchitel, an assertion she vigorously denied, according to The New York Post. After that several other women came forward alleging to have had liaisons with Woods. Last week on his Web site, Woods admitted to infidelity and said he was taking a break from golf to focus on his family.","Tiger Woods voted PGA Player of the Year by his peers .

"New York (CNN) -- Officials are investigating reports that two fire department dispatchers trained in emergency medical care refused to help a pregnant worker who collapsed in a cafe they were visiting. The woman later died. Eutisha Rennix collapsed while working at an Au Bon Pain restaurant in Brooklyn on December 9 and died at Long Island College Hospital, according to the district attorney's office for Brooklyn, which is looking into the incident. A spokesman for the office said Rennix was pregnant. The district attorney's office identified the two dispatchers as Jason Green and Melissa Jackson. The New York Fire Department has suspended them without pay pending a department investigation, spokesman Frank Dwyer said. Although the two worked as dispatchers, they had been trained as emergency medical technicians, said Steve Ritea, another department spokesman. Emergency medical technicians receive several weeks of training in medical care, he said . Rennix's co-workers said Green and Jackson were in the cafe at the time Rennix collapsed, but left after telling her co-workers to call 911, local media outlets reported. Rennix's mother, Cynthia, said she was told that her daughter's co-workers tried to get the two to help, but they refused, according to CNN affiliate NY1. ""If they were really caring and concerned, they would have taken a minute to see and probably, possibility, something to do or some way the could help her,"" Rennix said. But Jeff Samerson, a spokesman for the EMT and paramedics union that represents Green and Jackson, told NY1 that Jackson herself called 911. ""These are people that are not in the field, that have not had patient contact in years. ... And they did the best they could,"" Samerson said. The fire department, however, issued a statement saying, ""All of our members have taken an oath to assist others in need of emergency medical care."" Cynthia Rennix told CNN that she feels the EMTs were ""heartless"" and ""non-caring"" and hopes that her daughter's tragedy will prompt the city of New York to implement some sort of training or classes to ensure that a situation like this won't happen again. The victim's brother, Eudane Rennix, was overseas serving in the U.S. Army in Kuwait when he received the call about his sister's death. He came home on emergency leave and that is when, he said, the family broke down together. ""If this is your job, why wouldn't you want to help someone in need?"" he said. ""There's no excuse whatsoever."" Eutisha Rennix's fiance and the father of her unborn child, Harry Woodsen, said the losses have been hard on the whole family. ""Everybody has two losses,"" he said. ""I lost a fiance, and I lost a child. Her brother lost a sister and niece. Her mother lost a grandchild and her daughter."" The outrage at the incident has rippled beyond Brooklyn. Mayor Michael Bloomberg slammed the EMTs at a news conference Monday. ""Somebody's dying down the street and they say 'Help them,' and they just sat there,"" he said. ""There's no excuse whatsoever, as far as I can see.""","NEW: Fire department says the two are dispatchers but have EMT training .

"(CNN) -- Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney addressed the  Republican National Convention on Wednesday. Here is the text of that speech: . Former Gov. Mitt Romney says Sen. John McCain will rein in government spending. Romney: Thank you. Thank you so very much. Ann and I love you all. We have a deep feeling in our hearts for you. We respect you for the values you have and the vision we have for America together. Thank you so much, our dear friends. We sure love you. Thank you. You know, for decades now, the Washington sun has been rising in the east. You see, Washington has been looking to the eastern elites, to the editorial pages of the Times and the Post, and to the broadcasters from the -- from the coast. Yes.  Watch Romney's entire speech » . If America really wants to change, it's time to look for the sun in the west, because it's about to rise and shine from Arizona and Alaska. Last week, the Democratic convention talked about change. But what do you think? Is Washington now, liberal or conservative? Let me ask you some questions. Is a Supreme Court decision liberal or conservative that awards Guantanamo terrorists with constitutional rights? It's liberal. Is a government liberal or conservative that puts the interests of the teachers union ahead of the needs of our children? It's liberal. Is a Congress liberal or conservative that stops nuclear power plants and off-shore drilling, making us more and more dependent on Middle Eastern tyrants? It's liberal. Is government spending, putting aside inflation, liberal or conservative if it doubles since 1980? It's liberal. We need change all right: change from a liberal Washington to a conservative Washington. We have a prescription for every American who wants change in Washington: Throw out the big-government liberals and elect John McCain and Sarah Palin. It's the same prescription for a stronger economy. I spent 25 years in the private sector. I've done business in many foreign countries. I know why jobs come and why they go away. And I know that liberals don't have a clue. They think that we have the biggest and strongest economy in the world because of our government. They're wrong. America is strong because of the ingenuity, and entrepreneurship, and hard work of the American people. The American people have always been the source of our nation's strength, and they always will be. We strengthen our people and our economy when we preserve and promote opportunity. Opportunity is what lets hope become reality. Opportunity expands when there's excellence and choice in education, when taxes are lowered, when every citizen has affordable, portable health insurance, and when constitutional freedoms are preserved. Opportunity rises when children are raised in homes and schools that are free from pornography, and promiscuity, and drugs, where there are homes that are blessed with family values and the presence of a mom and a dad. America -- America cannot long lead the family of nations if we fail the family here at home. You see, liberals would replace opportunity with dependency on government largesse. They grow government and raise taxes to put more people on Medicaid, to take work requirements out of welfare, and to grow the ranks of those who pay no taxes at all. Dependency is death to initiative, to risk-taking and opportunity. It's time to stop the spread of government dependency and fight it like the poison it is. You know, it's time for the party of big ideas, not the party of Big Brother. Our economy is under attack. China is acting like Adam Smith on steroids, buying oil from the world's worst and selling nuclear technology. Russia and the oil states are siphoning more than $500 billion a year from us in what could become the greatest transfer of economic wealth in the history of the world. This is no time for timid, liberal, empty gestures. Our economy has slowed down this year, and a lot of people are hurting. What happened? Mortgage money was handed out like candy, and speculators bought homes for free. And when this mortgage mania finally broke, it slammed the economy. And stratospheric gas prices made things even worse. Democrats want to use the slowdown as an excuse to do what their special interests are always begging for: higher taxes, bigger government, and less trade with other nations. It's the same path Europe took a few decades ago. It leads to moribund growth and double-digit unemployment. The right course is the one championed by Ronald Reagan 30 years ago and by John McCain and Sarah Palin today. The right course is to rein in government spending, lower taxes, take a Weedwacker to excessive regulation and mandates, put a stop to tort windfalls, and to stand up to the Tyrannosaurus appetite of government unions. The right course -- the right course is to pursue every source of energy security, from new efficiencies to renewables, from coal to non-CO2 producing nuclear, and for the immediate drilling for more oil off our shores. And I have -- I have one more recommendation for energy conservation: Let's keep Al Gore's private jet on the ground. Last week, last week, did you hear any Democrats talk about the threat from radical, violent jihad? No. You see, Republicans believe that there is good and evil in the world. Ronald Reagan called out the evil empire. George Bush labeled the terror-sponsor states exactly what they are: The axis of evil. And at Saddleback, after Barack Obama dodged and ducked every direct question, John McCain hit the nail on the head: Radical, violent Islam is evil, and he will defeat it. This party... You're hearing it here. You're hearing it here, and they're hearing it across the country. You see, in this party, in this room tonight, and all over America, people in our party prefer straight talk to politically correct talk. Republicans, led by John McCain and Sarah Palin, will fight to preserve the values that have preserved the nation. We'll strengthen our economy and keep us from being held hostage by Putin, Chavez, and Ahmadinejad. And we will never allow America to retreat in the face of evil extremism. Just like you, just like you, there's never been a day when I was not proud to be an American. We -- we Americans inherited the greatest nation in the history of the Earth. It's our burden and our privilege to preserve it, to renew its spirit so that its noble past is prologue to its glorious future. To this we're all dedicated. And I firmly believe, by the providence of the almighty, that we will succeed. President McCain and Vice President Palin will keep America as it has always been: The hope of the Earth. Thank you, and God bless America.","Romney: The right course is the one championed by Ronald Reagan .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- An ill-tempered CONCACAF Gold Cup match between Mexico and Panama recently saw three players and Mexico coach Javier Aguirre sent off amid violent scenes in Houston, Texas. Newcastle teammates Lee Bowyer (left) and Kieron Dyer turn against one-another. The 1-1 draw, which saw the referee add on 10 minutes at the end for all the various stoppages, got Fanzone thinking about some of the most controversial match melees that have occurred. Do you agree with our worst 11? Post your comments in the Sound Off box below. 1 The Battle of Santiago, Chile v Italy, World Cup 1962 . Surely the most violent match in history. The tone was set when the first foul was committed after 12 seconds. Two Italian players were sent off as the teams spent the whole 90 minutes punching, spitting and scuffling with each other, with Chile managing to score two goals in-between the fighting. Police had to come onto the pitch three times to sort out the chaos while Italian Giorgio Ferrini had to be escorted off by armed officers when he refused to leave the pitch after his dismissal. Referee Ken Aston remarked: ""I wasn't reffing a football match, I was acting as an umpire in military maneuvers."" 2 Valencia v Inter Milan, Champions League 2007 . Six yellow cards were handed out during the game, but it was events that followed which marred Valencia's passage through to the quarterfinals. On the final whistle, Inter midfielder Nicolas Burdisso came together with Valencia defender Carlos Marchena, sparking a brawl. Unused Valencia substitute David Navarro then ran onto the field, to join in  - the result of which was a broken nose for Burdisso.  Navarro, retreated to the sidelines chased and kicked by Inter players Julio Cruz, Ivan Cordoba. The melee continued in the tunnel, with the Spanish Civil Guard eventually needed to quell the problem. UEFA, European football's governing body, subsequently fined Navarro $200,000 and banned the player for eight games, Burdisso was slapped with an eight-match suspension, Maicon for six, Córdoba for three games and Julio Cruz for two. 3 Turkey v Switzerland, World Cup play-off 2006 . Violence erupted after Turkey missed a place in the 2006 finals after going out on the away goals rule following a 4-2 win in Istanbul. Players and technical staff were seen throwing punches in the tunnel as the Swiss side ran for their lives against a torrent of Turkish anger. Turkey assistant-coach Mehmet Ozdilek was banned from all football for one year, while two Turkish players, and one Swiss, were handed six-match bans. Turkey were also ordered to play their next six competitive home matches behind closed doors at neutral venues. Have we missed a famous punch-up out? Leave your suggestions below . 4 Manchester United v Arsenal, English Division One 1990 . These two rivals have been involved in some juicy encounters over the years, but this is one of the most infamous. Arsenal defender Nigel Winterburn went in late on Manchester United's Denis Irwin prompting chaos, as 21 players, with Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman proving the exception, joining in the fracas. Remarkably nobody was sent off but the English Football Association took a dim view and deducted Arsenal two league points and United one. Arsenal won the match 1-0 and still went on to lift the title. 5 France v Italy, World Cup final 2006 . The great Zinedine Zidane had led an unfancied and ageing French side to the World Cup final. With the match level in extra time, the attentions of notorious Italian hard-man and chief agitator Marco Materazzi finally proved too much for the France No.10 - who responded to some choice words by the Inter Milan central defender by turning around and viciously head-butting his rival in the stomach. Zidane was sent off. France eventually lost on penalties and the Real Madrid playmaker bizarrely went on to be voted 'Player of the Tournament'. 6 Kevin Keegan v Billy Bremner, Liverpool v Leeds Charity Shield 1974 . England striker Keegan blamed Bremner for ""taking him out"" in an off the ball. Bremner was not one for holding back and Wembley stadium, home of some famous boxing matches over the years, played host to another as these two diminutive players slugged it out like two featherweights challenging for the WBC world title. Unsurprisingly both were sent off and added to their charge list by hurling their tops to the ground and walking off the pitch bare-chested. Each player was fined £500 ($810) and banned for 11 games, although shirt-throwing accounted for eight of the matches! 7 Rudi Voeller v Frank Rijkaard, Netherlands v Germany World Cup 1990 . Not the most violent, but certainly one of the funniest. The pair were sniping at each other throughout the match. Rijkaard came in late on Voeller, who later took his revenge with a lunge on goalkeeper Hans van Breukelen. Rijkaard took exception and, after a melee, the pair were sent off, with the Dutchman then notoriously spitting as hard as he could into the German's curly perm as the disgraced pair left the pitch. 8 Lee Bowyer v Kieron Dyer, Newcastle v Aston Villa English Premier League 2005 . Punch-ups are rare in modern football, but between teammates they are non-existent. These two hot-heads got into a debate over Dyer's refusal to pass Bowyer the ball. Both players had made news for their off-field activities in the past - but they took their behavior to a new low when they exchanged blows in the middle of the Newcastle half soon after Villa had gone 3-0 up. The pair later appeared alongside manager Graeme Souness to apologize for their conduct, but pointedly did not say sorry to each other. 9 LDU Quito v Barcelona, Ecuador league 2006 . A mass brawl at the end of the match on the final day of the season shocked Ecuador - and resulted in a host of suspensions being handed out. A total of 11 players were banned for between two and 12 months for taking part in the punch-up which saw four Barcelona players receive injuries. The incident started with a clash between former Ecuador striker Agustin Delgado and his marker Victor Montoya. 10 Cruzeiro v Atletico Mineiro Brazilian league 2007 . Atletico Mineiro defender Coelho did not take kindly to the seal dribble of talented teenager Kerlon - who collected the ball on the edge of the penalty area, flicked it up and performed his trademark dribble by bouncing the ball on his head as he ran towards goal. Coelho crashed into him and was given a straight red card and a four-month suspension. Other Atletico players remonstrated angrily with Kerlon, leading to an angry pushing match which interrupted the game for five minutes. Atletico coach Emerson Leao warned that Kerlon could get seriously injured if he tried the trick again. 11 Chelsea v Arsenal English League Cup final 2007 . With Chelsea winning 2-1 Arsenal defender Kolo Toure reacted angrily to a late challenge. Both sides had a number of African players in their line-ups and a mass brawl erupted which saw three of them, Arsenal's Emmanuel Adebayor, Toure and Chelsea's John Obi Mikel sent off. Adebayor refused to leave the pitch and it needed respective managers - the hot-headed pair of Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho - to stride onto the turf and defuse the situation.","Football Fanzone presents a rundown of 11 infamous pitch punch-ups .

"With the annual post-Thanksgiving multiplex malaise setting in and just one big new movie (Punisher: War Zone, which I'll get to later ... uh, much later) in theaters, the box office results remarkably resembled those of a week ago. Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn star in ""Four Christmases,"" which stayed at No. 1. So, yep, you guessed it: Four Christmases was No. 1 with $18.2 million, according to Sunday's estimates. That brings the holiday comedy's two-week sum to a sweet $70.8 million -- and it restores my confidence in Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon as box office draws. For now, at least. The rest of the top five is comprised of the same movies we've been seeing for a while now. Twilight moved back up to the No. 2 spot with a tidy $13.2 million haul; its three-week sum is $138.6 million. Bolt (No. 3) followed with $9.7 million, a huge and surprising 64 percent decline from its impressive Thanksgiving weekend sum. Australia declined 53 percent to bank $7 million at No. 4. And Quantum of Solace (No. 5) grossed $6.6 million and crossed the $500 million mark worldwide. Among major new releases, the biggest was hardly the baddest: Punisher: War Zone (No. 8) grossed a mere $4 million in 2,508 theaters, a tally that's way off from the $13.8 million that The Punisher premiered with in 2004. More punishment: The Marvel franchise reboot failed to defeat even last week's action disappointment, Transporter 3 which was No. 7 with $4.5 million. Ouch! Meanwhile, the other sorta-substantial new movie, Cadillac Records (No. 9), fared a bit better, bringing in a decent $3.5 million in 686 locations. But the indie drama Nobel Son failed to take any prize (except, perhaps, that of Box Office Flop of the Week), grossing just $370,575 in 893 venues -- a redonkulously low average of $415 per theater. Nay, the only real news of note came in the ultra-limited-release sphere, where the buzzy drama Frost/Nixon debuted with a tremendous $60,049 average in three theaters in New York, Los Angeles and Toronto. The Oscar contender will roll out wider in the coming weeks. Overall, the slow box office was actually up more than 6 percent from the same, even slower frame a year ago, when The Golden Compass produced disappointing returns.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- She stood by her husband throughout the contentious 2008 presidential campaign and during heated health care reform debates during his presidency. First lady Michelle Obama listens to remarks during a health care forum at the White House on Friday. Now, as the debate is reaching a fever pitch, first lady Michelle Obama is weighing in on the issue by focusing on how health care can affect families. ""What she's doing is putting a personal and human face on the issue ... there's nothing more crucial,"" said Washington Post columnist Sally Quinn. ""Everybody gets sick, and everybody has someone in the family that gets sick."" ""I think if you can humanize it and personalize it, it suddenly brings it home to people -- especially those who are screaming and yelling about the government taking over,"" Quinn said. On Friday, the first lady, a former hospital administrator, spoke about the issue to a crowd at the White House, highlighting her own family's experience with health care. In one touching moment, Obama recalled when daughter Sasha exhibited signs of potentially deadly meningitis when she was 4 months old. ""We didn't know what, but he [the doctor] told us she could have meningitis, so we were terrified. He said get to the emergency room right away,"" she said. ""Fortunately, things worked out."" ""But it is that moment in our lives that flashes through my head every time we engage in this health insurance conversation. It's that moment in my life, because I think about what on earth would we have done if we had not had insurance."" Mrs. Obama not only faced the issue as a mother, but also as a daughter. ""My father has multiple sclerosis. He contracted it in his 20s. ... He was able to get up and go to work every day, even though it got harder for him as he got sicker and more debilitated. And I find myself thinking what would we had done as a family on the south side of Chicago if my father hadn't had insurance.""  Watch more of Michelle Obama's message » . Quinn says that personal story is critical in the health care debate -- something that has been lacking in the president's message so far, which has often been deemed by pundits as too policy-oriented and too surgical in nature. ""What she's doing is she's humanizing the issue. And I think that has been missing in their [White House] campaign,"" she says. ""He's been so focused on the details and the strategy and the money that the individual problems and issues have seemed to have gotten lost in the fray."" Gloria Borger, a CNN senior political analyst, agreed. ""I think she's always been a great asset to him,"" she said. ""She can help in this health care debate by not getting involved in the minutiae of the bills, but essentially emphasizing the reason we need health care reform. And that's what she will stick to."" Michelle Obama was a lightning rod -- both good and bad -- throughout her husband's presidential campaign. Now, in her role as first lady, she has garnered greater support among American voters from both parties. A national survey by the Pew Research Center for People and the Press in April found that the first lady's positive ratings have increased since her husband took office. The poll found that 76 percent of Americans had a favorable opinion of her, which is up from 68 percent in January. ""Much of the change has come among Republicans, especially Republican women,"" the organization noted. ""About two-thirds of Republican women [67 percent] have a favorable impression of Michelle Obama, a gain of 21 points since January."" But a first lady's involvement in health care reform is nothing new. In the early '90s, first lady Hillary Clinton spearheaded the Clinton administration's push for reform, holding meetings, testifying before congressional committees and, in general, taking charge of the issue. ""Hillary Clinton was the architect of health care reform,"" Borger said. As for whether Michelle Obama is mirroring Clinton's role, the answer from both Borger and Quinn is absolutely not. ""I don't see any parallels at all. ... The Clintons came in, and they had run on the platform of buy one, get one free, a co-presidency and all of that. And she took over this huge thing herself. Bill wasn't doing it,"" Quinn said. She said the president, not Michelle Obama, was the was the one who pushed health care reform in his early domestic agenda. ""He promised in his campaign, and then he's the one that did it. This is not Michelle's plan. She hasn't been doing the town meetings and the national press conferences,"" she added. Borger said that the first lady is playing a completely different role. ""It's a much more supportive role, and it's a role out of the policy arena, but more in the arena of just why we ought to think we need reform.""","First lady Michelle Obama delivers remarks on health care reform Friday .

"(CNN) -- Target Corp. this month will open 27 new stores employing a total of more than 4,300 people, the company said. One of Target's two new Hawaii stores awaits its Sunday grand opening. The stores' openings will come just weeks after the retailer cut 600 people from its headquarters staff amid what it called weaker-than-expected sales. The retailer will hold grand openings for the 21 general merchandise stores and six full-grocery SuperTarget stores on Sunday. The new sites include the company's first two stores in Hawaii. Each general merchandise store employs 150 to 250 people, and each SuperTarget has 200 to 300 workers, the company said. In late January, Minnesota-based Target cut its headquarters staff by 9 percent and eliminated 400 open positions. The company, citing difficult economic conditions and sales that didn't meet expectations, also said it would soon close an Arkansas distribution center that employs 500 people and would cut back on planned new-store openings. ""We are clearly operating in an unprecedented economic environment that requires us to make some extremely difficult decisions to ensure Target remains competitive over the long term,"" Gregg Steinhafel, Target president and CEO, said in a news release that month. Retailers in the United States took a hit last year as a weak economy weighed on consumer spending. Retail sales fell six straight months until January, when sales rose 1 percent, according to the Commerce Department. However, retail experts said they were skeptical a rebound had taken hold. Still, two other retailers also announced plans to expand. Kohl's announced last month that it intends to open 55 stores in 2009, and Dollar General in February said it is looking to open more than 400 stores. Target reported its fourth-quarter net earnings were 40.7 percent lower than the same quarter a year earlier. Same-store sales in January were 3.3 percent lower than a year earlier. December same-store sales fell 4.1 percent. Target's new general merchandise stores are in Rogers, Arkansas; Santa Clarita, California; Pensacola, Florida; Bethlehem, Georgia; Honolulu and Kapolei, Hawaii; Council Bluffs, Iowa; Las Vegas, Nevada; Paramus, New Jersey; Cincinnati, Lebanon and Reynoldsburg, Ohio; Broken Arrow, Oklahoma; Philadelphia and Exton, Pennsylvania; Memphis, Tennessee; Houston, San Antonio and San Marcos, Texas; Midlothian, Virginia; and Sun Prairie, Wisconsin. The new SuperTarget stores are in Kissimmee, Florida; Canton, Georgia; Hillside, Illinois; and Pflugerville, Allen and Lewisville, Texas. The new locations will increase the number of Target stores to 1,699, the company said. CNNMoney.com's Parija B. Kavilanz contributed to this report.","Retailer's new stores to open in 16 states .

"FARGO, North Dakota (CNN) -- The Red River began to recede Sunday after rising to record levels, but officials cautioned residents not to let their guard down, especially in the face of an approaching snowstorm. A makeshift levee protects a house Sunday in Moorhead, Minnesota. ""We are very confident now that [the] river is in a slow decline,"" National Weather Service meteorologist Greg Gust said. ""Hopefully, it will be at about 38 feet by next Sunday."" A winter storm warning was issued Sunday for the Red River Valley area between North Dakota and Minnesota, from midday Monday through Tuesday evening. Forecasters expected as many as 10 inches of snow in the area and wind gusts up to 35 mph. Officials said the wind will cause waves in the floodwaters that will put more pressure on the sandbag dikes along the Red River, but the river levels were expected to continue their gradual decline. At 7:15 p.m. Sunday, the river at Fargo was at 39.75 feet, lower than its early Saturday peak of 40.82 feet and below the previous record of 40.10 feet set in 1897, according to the weather service. River levels were expected to stay below 41 feet and slowly drop over the next three to seven days, the weather service said. The river is considered at flood stage in Fargo when it reaches 18 feet.  Watch how Fargo residents are ""guardedly optimistic"" » . By Sunday morning, two deaths and 50 injuries had been reported in flood-related incidents. The injuries included victims of car wrecks caused by flooded roads, said Kirby Kruger, an epidemiologist with North Dakota Health Department. Other illnesses, including mental health issues, carbon monoxide poisoning and cardiac-related events were reported, Kruger said. Water seeped into two of five buildings at the Oak Grove Lutheran School primary and secondary complex after a flood barrier began to leak, officials said. School officials said the two buildings had about 6 inches of water in the basement. The school last flooded in 1997. ""We knew this flood was going to be different,"" school spokeswoman Ann Marie Campbell said. ""There was a lot of emotion this morning when we got the word we had a breach."" The school has 493 students from kindergarten through high school, Police Sgt. Ross Renner told CNN. A contingency dike contained the water, said Mayor Dennis Walaker, but three homes between the contingency dike and the primary dike also flooded. ""What happened up in Oak Grove, again, is a wake-up call for the general public,"" Walaker said. ""Those things will continue to happen. I guarantee it.""  Watch front lines of flood battle » . The University of North Dakota has canceled classes until noon Monday, while the Fargo campus of the North Dakota State University has been shut down until April 6 as the state waits to see whether the worst has passed. Despite reports the river was dropping, Fargo officials have said they are holding their breath. ""In past flooding, you have to understand, we've had times in which people thought it crested and then it came back and went up,"" Fargo Deputy Mayor Tim Mahoney said. ""And our temperature is changing, so we will be reluctant to announce a crest until we truly feel there's been a crest,"" he said. iReport.com: Are you there? Share your photos, video . City Manager Pat Zavoral added, ""We cannot think that we've passed some milestone here."" ""We've been under tremendous pressure to evacuate the city,"" Walaker said. ""We're not going to abandon our city. We've invested too much effort into this process."" iReport.com: Home's residents cut through deck to build dike . Some residents, however, have evacuated some neighborhoods, hospitals and nursing homes. iReport.com: . A storm with snow was approaching the area, Gust said. ""The snow [is] coming with that winter storm Monday night into Tuesday -- and Fargo could have 6 to 7 inches of snow here, the South Dakota border could see a foot or more -- but that snow should not affect that rate of decline one iota,"" he said. However, winds associated with the storm could affect the dikes, he said. iReport.com: ""It's as if it were a lake, not a river"" Like the Fargo authorities, officials across the river in Minnesota said the revised forecast did not allay their concerns. Residents of Moorhead, Minnesota, warily waited to see if miles of levees and sandbags would hold.  Watch how flooding is affecting Moorhead »  ""We're all in this together -- so far, so good,"" said U.S. Rep. Collin Peterson, D-Minnesota, at a Sunday news conference. ""Keep vigilant -- keep checking the dikes.""  Watch workers monitor the swollen Red River » . Evacuations in Moorhead were proceeding smoothly, Mayor Mark Voxland said on Sunday. No breaches of dikes were reported, he said. ""Sandbagging is ramping up again,"" said Mike Redlinger, Moorhead city manager. ""We're evaluating our supplies."" Sandbagging operations came to a close in Fargo on Friday, after weary volunteers had filled about 3 million sandbags.  See map of affected area » . About 1,700 National Guard members were checking dikes in the city of about 90,000 residents. Mahoney said the city -- North Dakota's most populous -- also had prepared ""sand balloons,"" about two tons of sand that could be dropped via helicopter onto any breach. President Obama said he was monitoring the situation carefully. The president has signed emergency and disaster declarations for Minnesota and North Dakota, freeing up federal funds for the region. Saturday's flood crest at Fargo set a new level that had held since 1897, when the Red River flooded and reached 40.1 feet at the city. The Red River approached the 1897 level in 1997, when it reached 39.6 feet, a level that many residents thought would be the highest they'd ever see. ""Everybody thought after '97 that we had seen the worst possible situation,"" Fargo resident Jim Shaw said. ""We thought we were safe, we survived that one, we're good for the rest of our lives. So believe it or not, even though this area is prone to flooding, this is a big shock, this is a big stunner, and it's probably a wake-up call,"" he said. ""Some people might reconsider wanting to stay here.""

"(CNN) -- I finally said goodbye to some old buddies. Omar (played by Michael K. Williams), ""The Wire's"" legendary stickup artist, hunts for a rival with his shotgun. One of them shot a woman at point-blank range after complimenting her on her hair. Another person maimed a rival with his shotgun. A third stole from his sister to finance his drug habit. Their names are as twisted as their deeds: Snot-Boogie, Bubbles, Dukie. And if I ever introduced you to them, you probably wouldn't be able to understand them. Their talk is filled with a bruising street poetry that's hard to decipher unless you've lived in their West Baltimore neighborhood -- as I once did. My ""friends"" are some of my favorite characters on the HBO series, ""The Wire."" HBO (which, like CNN, is a Time Warner division) released the complete, five-season box set two weeks ago. The show focuses on a detective unit's quest  to take down a ruthless drug crew, but it grapples with bigger themes: the collapse of public schools, the disintegration of working-class America and political corruption. Critics say ""The Wire"" offers the most realistic depiction of America's inner-city subculture ever seen. I decided to test that claim because I grew up in the West Baltimore community where ""The Wire"" is set. After watching all five seasons, my take on the show is ambivalent. Some of ""The Wire"" is real, but not in the ways you might expect. 'How do I get from here to the rest of the world?' ""The Wire's"" most unsettling scene for me took place in season four. It involved a murder  -- of a gentle teenager's spirit. The character's name is Dukie, and he brought back memories of some people I knew. Dukie is lost. He has no family, his public school is paralyzed by violence and he's not tough enough to make it on the streets. He has a gift for computers but doesn't know what to do with his ability. Dukie looks one day for help from ""Cutty,"" an ex-con who runs a boxing gym in their neighborhood. Cutty tells Dukie that ""the world is bigger"" than the violent neighborhood both live in. ""How do I get from here to the rest of the world?"" Dukie asks Cutty. ""I wish I knew,"" Cutty sighs, and walks away. Why did Cutty give Dukie such a hopeless answer? Maybe it's because some people who never lived in a neighborhood like ""The Wire"" confuse hopelessness for authenticity. Yeah, I could shock you with stories of violence, but it's so easy to slip from revelation to titillation. I start off telling you a story about how tough my school was, and soon I'm shooting it out with five drug dealers who want to steal my homework. But I never remember West Baltimore being so hopeless. A man like Cutty wouldn't tell a young man that he had no way out -- adults rallied around kids with potential. I even checked with some childhood friends -- one who is now an undercover police officer who literally works a ""wire"" for the Baltimore Police Department -- and we all agreed that ""The Wire's"" bleakness was exaggerated. ""They made it seem like we grew up in Bosnia,"" my friend, another ""Wire"" fan, told me. Perhaps I had the luck of timing, or, to paraphrase one ""Wire"" character, I left  just before ""the game got more fierce."" I'm 44. I grew up on a street connecting two notorious Baltimore landmarks -- North Avenue and Frederick Douglass High School. Douglass is a school so bleak that PBS recently aired a documentary on its dismal state. North Avenue is known for its liquor stories and shootings. I left my neighborhood for good in the 1980s before crack cocaine really hit. Still, I shared some of the same struggles as some ""Wire"" characters. I spent much of my childhood in the equivalent of foster homes. I never really knew my mother. My father was an on-and-off-again presence. But my community was filled with what Barack Obama calls the ""quiet heroes."" (Obama reportedly is a big fan of ""The Wire."") There was my high school tennis coach. The dignified deacons in my church. The retired steelworker who watched Orioles baseball games on his porch next door. Relatives, teachers, even summer job programs (one gave me my first exposure to journalism) -- all inspired me. Yet those quiet heroes seem fated to fail in ""The Wire."" The show implies that only a fantastic few ever escape the streets. What Cutty could have told Dukie . Despite my misgivings, I love ""The Wire."" The dialogue crackles, the characters are rich and the minute ways it captures how Baltimoreans move and talk is uncanny. But the ""Complete"" story isn't the whole story. ""The Wire"" did, however, nail one childhood memory for me. The most realistic moment in ""The Wire"" for me didn't take place during any violent showdown. It took place in a steakhouse. The scene involved a ""Wire"" character called ""Bunny"" Colvin, a major in the Baltimore Police Department. Colvin helps run an experimental program for problem students at a local high school. One night, he decides to take three of a school's most disruptive students to a steakhouse in downtown Baltimore. The kids are loud and brash, but they're petrified when they have to sit down in a fancy restaurant filled with white people. They can't function and end up leaving the restaurant, still hungry and angry. I could relate. When I was asked in high school to join an academic team that would compete on television against elite, white high schools in Baltimore, I said no. When I attended my first year in college, I wouldn't speak in class and stopped going because I was so intimidated being around people who could actually speak proper English. I almost flunked out. I felt like an imposter. Sometimes, it's not enough to give kids who come from a world like ""The Wire"" the chance to get out. They also have to be convinced that they deserve it. I almost sabotaged myself because I wanted to go back to what was familiar. Even though the familiar was depressing, it was all I knew. Now I know something different because a lot of people convinced me that I deserved to be in that other world. I wish Cutty would have done the same for Dukie. I wish he would have told him he would find a way from ""here to the rest of the world."" I hope the real-life Dukies know that. They deserve a chance to say goodbye to that world, too.","HBO's ""The Wire"" is praised for realism, but how real is it?

"(CNN) -- Susan Atkins, a terminally ill former Charles Manson follower convicted in the murder of actress Sharon Tate, on Tuesday was denied a compassionate release from prison. Susan Atkins, Califorina's longest-serving female inmate, is shown in her most recent mug shot. Atkins, 60, has been diagnosed with brain cancer and has had a leg amputated, her attorney said. In June, she requested the release, available to terminally ill inmates with less than six months to live. The California Board of Parole Hearings' decision -- posted Tuesday on its Web site -- came after a public hearing on Atkins' request. It means the request will not be forwarded to the Los Angeles Superior Court that sentenced Atkins. The court would have had the final say on Atkins' release. Her attorney, Eric P. Lampel, called the parole board's decision ""unfortunate."" ""[The board] ignored the vast majority of evidence presented,"" Lampel said. ""There was a huge amount of pro-compassionate release testimony from many witnesses. It apparently fell on deaf ears."" Known within the Manson Family as Sadie Mae Glutz, Atkins and four others were convicted in connection with the deaths of five people, including Tate, in August 1969. According to historical accounts of the murder, Atkins stabbed Tate, who was eight months pregnant, and scrawled the word ""pig"" in blood on the door of the home the actress shared with director Roman Polanski. By her own admission, Atkins held Tate down and rejected her pleas for mercy, stabbing the pregnant woman 16 times. Atkins' request roused long-dormant memories of the two-day killing spree that terrorized Los Angeles and left seven people dead. It polarized those who were involved in the case -- and even those who weren't -- over whether she should die behind bars. Atkins told a 1993 parole board that Tate pleaded for her unborn child's life as she held her down. ""She asked me to let her baby live,"" Atkins said. ""... I told her I didn't have any mercy on her."" Three of Tate's houseguests were also slain by the killers, as was a teenager visiting the home's caretaker in his cottage out back. Atkins was also convicted in the earlier murder of music teacher Gary Hinman. One of the first people Atkins confessed to was Virginia Graham, who shared a cell with her before investigators determined the Manson Family was responsible for the murders. Graham said last month she believed Atkins should die in prison. ""She showed that poor woman absolutely no mercy, none,"" Graham said. ""So why should anybody show her mercy at this time?"" Sharon Tate's sister, Debra, has staunchly opposed Atkins' release. ""She will be set free when judged by God,"" Debra Tate has said. ""It's important that she die in incarceration."" Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley said Monday he was strongly opposed to the release, saying in a letter to the board it would be ""an affront to people of this state, the California criminal justice system and the next of kin of many murder victims."" Cooley noted in his letter that Atkins was initially sentenced to death, like others in the Manson Family, including its leader, Charles Manson. Their sentences were commuted to life in prison in 1972, when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the death penalty laws as they were written at the time. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said Tuesday he was also opposed to releasing Atkins. ""I don't believe in [compassionate release],"" the governor told reporters. ""I think that they have to stay in, they have to serve their time."" Even if Atkins is dying, Schwarzenegger said, ""Those kinds of crimes are just so unbelievable that I'm not for the compassionate release."" Earlier, Suzan Hubbard, director of adult prisons in California, also recommended against granting Atkins' request. Vincent Bugliosi, who prosecuted Atkins and other members of the Manson Family, said he supported her release, if only to save the state money. Through Monday, the cost for Atkins' medical care since she was hospitalized March 18 totaled more than $1.15 million, and the costs for guarding her hospital room are more than $308,000, said California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation spokeswoman Terry Thornton. Terminally ill inmates rarely are allowed compassionate release, records show. In 2007, 60 such requests were made to the department, Thornton has said. Ten were approved. Atkins, who has been incarcerated since 1971, is California's longest-serving female inmate. According to a Web site maintained by her husband and attorney, James Whitehouse, she is now a born-again Christian. During her incarceration, the site says, Atkins worked to help at-risk youth, violent crime victims and homeless children, among others. The Web site does not mention Atkins' illness. Lampel said last month Atkins is paralyzed on one side. ""She can talk a little bit,"" Lampel said. ""She can't sit up in bed without assistance, and obviously she can't walk around because she's an amputee."" Atkins has expressed remorse for her crimes. ""I know the pain I caused Mrs. Tate,"" she said at a parole board hearing in 1985. ln May, authorities dug for buried bodies at the Inyo County, California, ranch where Manson and his followers once lived, after police became aware that testing had indicated human remains might be buried there. Nothing was found, authorities said. CNN's Ted Rowlands contributed to this report.","Manson follower, 60, terminally ill, expected to die within six months .

"(CNN) -- In light of the botched Christmas Day airliner bombing aboard Northwest Airlines Flight 253 en route from Amsterdam to Detroit, the Transportation Security Administration has announced new enhanced ""guidelines"" requiring airline passengers traveling from (and through) 14 different countries to undergo especially rigorous security screening before being able to fly into the United States. Under these new TSA guidelines, security screeners will conduct ""full pat-down body checks"" and extensive carry-on luggage checks for all passengers traveling from a country which the U.S. considers to be a ""security risk."" These 14 countries are: Afghanistan, Algeria, Cuba, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Libya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Additionally, passengers traveling from any other foreign country may also be checked at 'random' as well. These new rules mean that ""every individual flying into the U.S. from anywhere in the world traveling from or through nations that are state sponsors of terrorism or other countries of interest will be required to go through enhanced screening,"" the TSA said. On its face, this clear use of ethnic, racial and religious profiling will not achieve greater security in the long term for our country. In fact, by targeting only certain passengers for additional screening, ""blind spots"" can be easily identified and duplicitously exploited by violent extremists wishing our country harm. Defenders of the new rules might say they're only profiling people coming from certain countries, but the fact that 13 of the 14 are Muslim countries makes clear the religious nature of the profiling. This new policy deeply undermines the Obama administration's stated commitment to civil rights, equality before the law, and a much-needed effort to rebuild U.S.-Muslim world relations since the disastrous presidency of George W. Bush. Under international law, countries including the United States that use race, color, ethnicity, religion or nationality as a proxy for criminal suspicion are in violation of international standards against racial discrimination and multiple treaties to which the U.S. is a party. These include the U.N. Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) and the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The clear alternative is for law enforcement agencies to focus on actual criminal behavior rather than solely on characteristics such as race, religion, ethnicity, or nationality. Senior international security experts have suggested, for example, that such an approach would have increased the chances that suspected shoe-bomber Richard Reid would have been stopped before he successfully boarded an airplane he intended to attack in December 2001. Among the red flags were that Reid bought a one-way ticket with cash and had no checked luggage. For years, the concept of ""racial profiling"" has reportedly undermined important terrorist investigations here in the United States. Most notably, these examples include the April 1995 Oklahoma City bombing in which the two white male domestic terrorists, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, were able to flee while officers operated on the theory that the act had been committed by ""Arab terrorists"" for the first 48 hours of the investigation. Similarly, during the October 2002 Washington-area sniper investigation, the African-American man and boy ultimately accused of the crime reportedly were able to pass through multiple road blocks with the alleged murder weapon in their possession, in part, because police 'profilers' theorized the crime had been committed by a white male acting alone. According to a report last summer by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Rights Working Group to the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination: ""Both Democratic and Republican administrations [in the United States] have acknowledged that racial profiling is unconstitutional, socially corrupting and counter-productive, yet this unjustifiable practice remains a stain on American democracy and an affront to the promise of racial equality."" In fact, not only do such ""racial profiling"" practices waste limited resources, they simply make us less safe. For example, the arrests of John Walker Lindh (a white, middle-class man better known as the 'American Taliban') and Richard Reid (a British citizen of West Indian and European ancestry now serving a life sentence at the Supermax prison in Colorado) confirm that effective law enforcement techniques must rely solely on criminal behavior and not race, religion or nationality in order to ensure our citizens' security. As the San Diego Union-Tribune said in an editorial: ""The minute U.S. officials put out the word that they're not scrutinizing people with blond hair and blue eyes is the minute that al Qaeda starts recruiting people with blond hair and blue eyes. Would looking for Arab-Americans have turned up a passenger that resembled ""American Taliban"" fighter John Walker Lindh? Would applying extra scrutiny to people with foreign-sounding names have kept would-be shoe bomber Richard Reid off a plane?"" Of course not. Even conservative Republicans like former House Speaker Newt Gingrich have argued that behavioral (and not racial/ethnic) profiling is the best way to prevent terrorist attacks on our country. ""We need to have the knowledge to be able to profile based on behavior,"" Mr. Gingrich recently said on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" while discussing the recent Christmas Day foiled bombing. ""Not racial profiling or ethnic profiling, but profiling based on behavior and then, frankly, discriminating based on behavior,"" he continued during the same interview. As our national debate on the phenomenon of ""racial profiling"" emerges once again, let's remember these words of the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman John Conyers of Michigan: . ""If Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. were alive today ... he would tell us we must not allow the horrific acts of terror that our nation has endured to slowly and subversively destroy the foundation of our democracy."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Arsalan Iftikhar .","New TSA rules amount to ethnic and religious profiling, says Arsalan Iftikhar .

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Russia's president launched a verbal volley at Georgia's leaders on Monday, as Georgia hit back with renewed accusations that the Russian invasion was premeditated. Russian soliders on patrol outside the Georgian city of Gori on Monday. President Dmitry Medvedev said: ""The world has seen that even today, there are political morons who are ready to kill innocent and defenseless people in order to satisfy their self-serving interests, while compensating for their own inability to resolve complicated issues by using the most terrible solution -- by exterminating an entire people. ""I think that there should be no mercy for that. We will do our best not to let this crime go unpunished."" He was speaking at a visit to the military headquarters at Vladikavkaz, near the Russian-Georgian border. Each side accuses the other of ""ethnic cleansing"" during the conflict over South Ossetia, which erupted August 7. In Washington, Georgia's ambassador to the United States said the Russian push into Georgia the following day had been long planned. ""You just don't move more than 1,200 tanks and 15,000 soldiers into a country within 12 hours without previous planning,"" Ambassador Vasil Sikharulidze said. The conflict began more than a week ago when Georgian troops entered the breakaway territory of South Ossetia to attack pro-Moscow separatists. Russia responded by invading the country on August 8, prompting heavy fighting with Georgian forces that spread to another breakaway territory, Abkhazia. The Georgian troops withdrew and Russian forces took control of several areas -- prompting an international outcry. After diplomatic efforts led by France on behalf of the European Union, Georgia and Russian signed a cease-fire. France is the rotating EU head. Russia's military says its withdrawal from Georgia has begun, but a senior Pentagon official told reporters Monday evening that there has been little evidence of Russian troops pulling out. The official did not want to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.   Watch more on Russian withdrawal » . ""We're talking about pulling our troops away to the borders of South Ossetia. They will not be on Georgia territory,"" Gen. Anatoly Nogovitsyn, the Russian armed forces deputy chief of staff, said Monday. White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said Russia needs to start pulling back ""without delay,"" saying the ""Russians have committed to withdrawing, and they need to withdraw. And so that is what we are looking for."" A Georgian Interior Ministry official said there have been ""no signs"" of a Russian troop withdrawal despite Russia's pledge to start moving back on Monday. News footage showed Russian tanks pushing away Georgian police cars about 20 miles (32 km) south of Georgia's capital, Tbilisi.  Watch tanks deal with the police car » . Witnesses said Georgian police cars had been blocking the road and the police told Russian tank commanders that they were carrying out orders. The tanks proceeded to plow ahead, damaging the police cars in the process. The Georgian Foreign Ministry said a Russian armored column had been seen moving a bit deeper into Georgian territory, traveling south from Kashuri to Borjomi. Kashuri is about 10 miles (16 km) south of South Ossetia. Another column was moving north from the Kashuri area to Sachkhere. Nogovitsyn told reporters Russian troops were leaving Gori on Monday, the Interfax news agency said. He did not say how many troops were withdrawing or how many would return to South Ossetia or Russia. However, CNN journalists in Gori, near South Ossetia, said it was still under Russian control and there was no evidence the Russians were pulling out. Also, Russian tank and artillery positions were seen extending nine miles (15 km) south of Gori. Nogovitsyn said Russia was not yet moving vessels in the Black Sea from their positions near Georgia, but they would return to Sevastopol after the settlement of the conflict. He said Russia's deputy foreign minister had presented the U.S. ambassador to the country with a timetable of the events that led to Russia's actions and clearly indicated Georgia's responsibility. He said a prisoner exchange involving the transfer of 12 Russians and 15 Georgians had been set up. ""We were all set and then the Georgians came up with a bunch of new requirements with no time for us to act so the time to exchange prisoners was interrupted,"" Nogovitsyn said. Georgia said Russia was spreading ""false"" accusations and that it was ready to pursue an exchange. The six-point deal gives no timetable for a Russian withdrawal, nor any other specifics, according to a copy of the agreement provided by Georgia's government. A U.S. defense official told CNN about evidence of Russian SS-21 missiles and launchers in South Ossetia. Lt. Gen. Nikolai Uvarov, a Russia Defense Ministry spokesman, disputed that, telling CNN that ""no, they are not present."" The U.S. official said while ""Russian forces continue to consolidate their enclaves in South Ossetia and Abkhazia,"" they ""are expected to slowly remove forces from Georgia."" Diplomatic discussions continued Monday. Finland's Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb, representing the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, was in Brussels, Belgium, to meet with representatives from the European Union, NATO, and the United Nations. The OSCE is working on a plan to increase its observers in the region to 100 people. Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch said there was ""mounting evidence that Russian and Georgian military used armed force unlawfully during the South Ossetian conflict"" and it emphasized that this ""highlights the need for international fact-finding missions in Georgia."" ""This conflict has been a disaster for civilians,"" said Rachel Denber, Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia deputy director. The conflict has devastated parts of Georgia and South Ossetia, with many casualties reported. The U.N. refugee agency said more than 158,000 people had been displaced by fighting in Georgia, mostly from districts outside the breakaway territories where the fighting began. CNN's Bruce Conover, Jill Dougherty and Max Tkachenko in Moscow, Fred Pleitgen in Tbilisi, Georgia, Tommy Evans and Michael Ware in Gori, Georgia, and Barbara Starr at the Pentagon contributed to this report.","NEW: Pentagon official: Little evidence that Russian troops leaving Georgia .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwean opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai returned to Zimbabwe Saturday for the first time since leaving the country shortly after the controversial March 29 election. Morgan Tsvangirai has been away from Zimbabwe trying to seek support from international leaders. Tsvangirai -- who contends he won the presidential race against longtime Zimbabwe leader Robert Mugabe -- returned despite what his party said was a plot by the country's military to assassinate him and other party leaders. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, after a long delay, ruled that neither candidate won a necessary majority of the vote and set a date of June 27 for Tsvangirai to again face Mugabe in a runoff vote. Tsvangirai and his Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) have called for international observers to be allowed to monitor the runoff election, but Mugabe's government has refused the demand. Tsvangirai is expected to tour hospitals in Harare to visit victims of post-election violence. An MDC spokesman said two party members were found dead Wednesday night after being abducted from their homes in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare. Tsvangirai's spokesman George Sibotshiwe said Saturday that the opposition leader and the entire MDC leadership are ""at risk from this brutal regime."" When contacted by CNN, a Cabinet member denied that the government had any possible role in the alleged plot, and said the report was an effort by the MDC to gain international sympathy. Chen Chimutengwende, Zimbabwe's minister of public and interactive affairs, accused Tsvangirai of ""trying to paint a false picture of what Zimbabwe and Zimbabwe authorities are like."" ""There is no plot against him and there has never been any plot against him and he knows that,"" Chimutengwende said. He called the reports from Tsvangirai's party ""an effort to get sympathy from the international community."" There have been numerous reports from the MDC and church groups since the March balloting about kidnappings, torture, and other violence, including the deaths of opposition party members. They say the violence targets opponents of Mugabe and his Zanu-PF party. Mugabe has ruled the southern African country since it became independent 28 years ago.","Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai returns to Zimbabwe .

"(CNN) -- Smoking is bad for you, and by now, most of us know it. An estimated 4.5 million U.S. adolescents are cigarette smokers. It seems that studies on the dangers of smoking come out every week. Just recently, after an article appeared in the journal Pediatrics, we were introduced to the concept of third-hand smoke, the potentially toxic residue that lingers in curtains, clothing, hair, etc. after the smoke itself blows away. To recap: Smoking exponentially increases your risk of developing lung cancer (and other lung diseases, like emphysema and chronic bronchitis) and puts you at higher risk for cancer of the mouth, throat, larynx, esophagus, bladder, pancreas, kidney, cervix and stomach. Smoking also elevates the risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke and insulin resistance. And, as if all that weren't bad enough, it causes wrinkles. Yet stand on virtually any streetcorner of any city or town in the United States, and you will see people smoking. So, who exactly -- in the face of all the mounting scientific evidence, social stigma and legal bans -- still lights up? According to the CDC, about 43.4 million Americans (19.8 percent of the population) smoke. Look around you. If you are in Kentucky, the state with the highest smoking rate, more than one out of every four people (28.3 percent) around you smokes. On the other end of the spectrum is Utah, with just over one person in 10 (11.7 percent) a smoker.  Find the smoking rate in your state » . Here's the good news: ""Smoking prevalence in the entire country has gone under 20 percent for first time in over 50 years,"" said Dr. Richard Hurt, director of the Nicotine Dependence Center at the Mayo Clinic. ""For women, it's 18 percent in most places, and for men it's hovering at about 20 percent. We have gone from one in two men smoking to one in five -- a very dramatic change -- and one in three women to one in five."" Here's the bad news: Smoking rates are unlikely to drop to the national health objective of 12 percent by 2010. Hurt, who is also a professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine in Rochester, Minnesota, is a former three-pack-a-day smoker. Unlike most smokers, he picked up the habit during college; according to the CDC, about 90 percent of heavy smokers start in high school. And studies show that the younger you are when you start, the more likely you'll become a heavy smoker as an adult. According to the American Cancer Society, each day more than 3,500 people younger than 18 try their first cigarette, and 1,100 others become regular daily smokers. About one-third of these kids will eventually die from a smoking-related disease. Retired radio broadcaster and iReporter Gerald Dimmitt, 65, has smoked since he was 14. ""I've always smoked a pipe,"" he said. ""I have successfully quit about 40 times."" But, he says, he always restarted, because ""it calms me down."" iReport.com: Do you still smoke? Dimmitt has even more incentive to quit now, since developing lesions and irritation in his mouth. After speaking to his doctor, he received a prescription for Chantix, a pill to aid with smoking cessation. But when he went to pick up his prescription at the pharmacy, he was charged $139 (because it's not generic) for two weeks worth. Outraged, he left the Chantix behind. ""If smoking is so dangerous ... why then do they want to charge $139 to make me stop? There is something very wrong with that. I guess they would rather pay to take care of lung cancer,"" he said. Some would-be smokers pick up their first cigarette to fit in. ""I started smoking at 12 years old to be part of the 'in' crowd. It never got me into the 'in' crowd, but with my first cigarette, I was totally hooked,"" wrote Lori Jerome, 45, a former bartender and now full-time university student from Canada. Said Lisa ""Smith,"" 44, a recently laid-off administrator from Minnesota, ""I began smoking in junior high school because I wanted to fit in with a certain crowd. However, that group of friends is looooong gone from my life and I still have the nasty habit."" Smith didn't want her last name used. Hurt says the reason many people start, and continue, is peer influence. But he also blames targeted promotions by tobacco companies (like Virginia Slims targeting women in the 1970s and other brands targeting inner-city minority groups today) and the movies. ""There is a lot of research right now that shows that smoking in the movies has made a comeback. ... It clearly affects start-up smoking among young people."" As for things that prevent children from smoking, Hurt cites higher cigarette taxes and smoke-free zones, like offices and restaurants. ""Those two public health policies do three things: reduce smoking among continuing smokers, help people to stop smoking and reduce the chances of our children starting to smoke, because it de-normalizes it. ... The child interprets smoke-free as the social norm,"" he said. That's why children of smokers are much more likely to become smokers themselves: Smoke-filled surroundings is their norm. Of course, society's perception of smoking has changed a lot since the days of doctors actually endorsing one brand or another in the first half of last century. Dimmitt recalls ""ashtrays in church pews, smoking in the classroom and blowing pipe smoke all over the students!"" ""When I was born, my mother was allowed to smoke in the hospital room with me in there,"" Jerome said. ""When I had my adult children, we were allowed to smoke in the day room on the maternity ward floor, although the babies were not allowed in there. When I had my youngest children, ages 5 and 8 now, you couldn't smoke in the hospital. How the times have changed."" Now, smokers in some places face smoking bans in certain public and private spaces, and unspoken -- and sometimes overt -- hostilities. Smith, a mother of six, wrote, ""It's so socially unacceptable where I live, and none of my current friends or relatives smoke. In fact, I don't even smoke out in public anymore -- unless it's dark and I'm in my car. I feel it's such a disgusting and stinky habit."" Dulcie Long, 50, of Denver, Colorado, said, ""I won't say I feel actual 'social discrimination,' but it is something I feel a sense of shame about and do my best not to smoke in the presence of friends. None of my friends smoke, and I'm very uncomfortable doing it anywhere near them."" Even Dimmitt switched from a pipe to cigarettes when he was working with youngsters so he wouldn't reek so much. Not only have attitudes towards smoking changed, the profile of smokers has changed, too. ""The demographics have changed so much that now, more often than not, it's the disadvantaged who are still smoking compared to the highly educated, highly trained people,"" Hurt said. ""It is pretty clear that the prevalence of smoking in groups of people is related to education status, which is a surrogate for income status. ... When you go down the income ladder, the smoking prevalence rises. Some groups of severely disadvantaged people have smoking rates of 30 to 40-plus percent."" Hurt says that there is also a much higher prevalence of smoking among people with mental health disorders like depression, alcoholics, drug users and schizophrenics. But movers and shakers are not immune. President-elect Barack Obama has struggled with, and seems to have conquered, his habit. Former President Clinton was known to sit on the balcony of the White House and enjoy a cigar (his wife, Secretary of State-designate Hilary Clinton, officially made the White House a smoke-free zone). First lady Laura Bush admits to being an ex-smoker. Plenty of celebrities -- like actresses Salma Hayek, Katherine Heigl and Eva Longoria Parker -- have been caught, cigarette in mouth, by the paparazzi. Even actor Patrick Swayze, who is battling pancreatic cancer, admitted that he continues to smoke. Which brings us back to the inescapable fact that, worldwide, an estimated 4 million adults die each year of tobacco-caused diseases. Said Hurt, ""This is only product that I know on the face of the Earth which, if it is used as recommended by manufacturer, kills 60 percent of its customers.""","Despite health effects, bans and social pressure, 20 percent Americans smoke .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The U.S. military plans to help the Afghanistan government recruit, train and arm local Afghans to fight a resurgent Taliban, U.S. military officials say. U.S. soldiers patrol near Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan on Wednesday. U.S. officials describe the proposal as a ""community-based"" security effort. The main job of the local units is to be an ""early warning system"" and be armed mainly for defensive operations, a U.S. military official said. Participants will get uniforms so they can be readily identified, officials said. The first phase of the program is expected to begin next year in Wardak province, where the Taliban have overrun many local government institutions. For the United States, the most sensitive part of the proposal will be the use of American military funds to purchase small arms, most likely AK-47 rifles, that will be given to local Afghans, according to a U.S. military official. U.S. commanders acknowledge concerns that arming local groups is risky, as it could lead to new armed conflicts between tribes, putting American troops in the middle of unexpected firefights. The Afghan government will select men for the new security program. It will train them and technically arm them, although the funds will come from the U.S. military. The Afghans will be responsible for ensuring the loyalty of people in the program, but the United States will oversee the effort and collect biometric information, such as eyeprints and fingerprints, on all participants, according to the U.S. military official. U.S. officials are emphasizing that because of tribal diversity, the Afghan program differs from the Awakening Councils in Iraq, which include tens of thousands of Sunni gunmen and was credited with helping reduce violence there.","""Community-based"" security effort designed to counter Taliban gains .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Postal Service spent more than $792,000 ""without justification"" on meals and events in one five-month period even as it reported losing $3.8 billion this year, the agency's inspector general says in a report. Employees spent $792,022 on meals and external events ""without justification for food purchases, purchased alcohol without officer approval and exceeded the dollar limit for meals,"" the report says. Among the purchases were crab cakes, beef Wellington and scallops at an installation ceremony for one of several postmasters in the United States, the report says. Despite the Postal Service's mandate to curtail spending, its inspector general found that ""imprudent spending continues to occur, including continued purchases of gift cards from unauthorized vendors and expensive items purchased as employee recognition awards and retirement gifts."" Read the full report (PDF) Such purchases conflict with the agency's goal to drive down costs, according to the report, which covered spending during several months in late 2008 and early 2009. The Postal Service reported a $3.8 billion net loss for the 2009 fiscal year, despite cost-cutting and reductions in retiree health benefit payments. Asked about the expenses, a Postal Service spokesman pointed to an agency response included in the report. In that response, the agency's vice president and controller, Vincent Devito, agreed to enforce a spending limit on events and recognition awards as well as make sure employees justify business meal expenses. ""We agree that further policy enforcement is essential to ensure that the policy is followed and imprudent spending is no longer an issue,"" Devito wrote. ""It appears there is still work to be done in curtailing spending even further during this time of economic uncertainty."" Among the report's findings: . • There was ""no business justification"" for $355,451 of food provided at a September 2008 national sales educational conference; it included a $96-per-person dinner and a $500 ""bartender charge."" • An installation celebration for one postmaster -- the report didn't say where -- included ""unallowable food purchases"" totaling more than $17,000. The menu included ""crab cakes, beef Wellington, shrimp and scallops"" even though Postal Service guidelines allow for only ""light snacks"" at such events. • There was ""no business necessity or justification"" provided for $77,757 in breakfast meals for events between September 2008 and February 2009. The report, issued December 3, documented purchases for lodging, table linens, flowers and other items ""that we consider excessive during this challenging economic time."" ""Such purchases are in direct conflict with the Postal Service's objective of driving down costs in all operations and processes,"" the report said. ""Moreover, the public's image of such purchases could have a detrimental effect on the Postal Service's public image."" The report cited two Postal Service districts that purchased movie tickets for $14,140 to give incentives to employees after the postmaster general ""issued a memo directing a curtailment of spending."" It also documented the purchase of 30 retirement watches, costing $216 each, in another district. A CNN investigation this year revealed that the Postal Service spent $1.2 million to buy the lakefront home of an employee who was relocating. The purchase was part of a policy that allowed the Postal Service to pay for employee homes when they moved, whatever the cost. Months after the story, the Postal Service changed its policy to limit home purchases to $800,000.","Purchases included crab cakes, beef Wellington, scallops for postmaster installation ceremony .

"(CNN) -- Brazilian authorities detained the wife of former world boxing champion Arturo Gatti as a suspect in his killing, according to local reports. Arturo Gatti pictured during the final fight of his career, a knockout defeat by Alfonso Gomez in 2007. Gatti was found dead Saturday in a hotel in Brazil, where he was taking a vacation with his wife, Amanda Carina Barbosa Rodrigues, and their young child. The 37-year-old Canadian, who was born in Italy and made his name as a fighter based in New Jersey, was staying in the northeast seaside resort of Porto de Galihnas. Rodrigues, 23, was being held in a police station in the city of Recife in connection with the killing, a police official in Porto de Galihnas told CNN. Police official Osmar Silva Santiago confirmed local reports that Gatti's body was found Saturday morning in his hotel room with strangulation marks. ""This crime is being investigated by our homicide experts and we hope to have more answers tomorrow,"" Santiago said. Police recovered a blood-stained purse strap from the scene, according to media reports. Rodrigues became a suspect because of inconsistencies during her interrogation, local reports quoted homicide task force chief Josedith Ferreira as saying. Gatti made his name in a series of three fights against ""Irish"" Micky Ward, losing the first but triumphing in the other two. He held the IBF super-featherweight and WBC light-welterweight titles, and he also won the WBC junior welterweight belt but lost it to Floyd Mayweather Jr. in 2005. Gatti retired in 2007 after suffering a knockout defeat by Alfonso Gomez in his comeback, ending with a record of 40 wins and nine losses. He grew up in Montreal, Quebec, after leaving Italy at an early age, and returned to the city following his retirement. According to Gatti's official Web site, the Italian-born pugilist won ""Fight of the Year"" for three consecutive years.

"(CNN)  -- Jurors started to deliberate Friday after prosecutors and defense attorneys made closing arguments in the murder trial of an anti-abortion activist charged with killing a doctor who performed late-term abortion procedures. Scott Roeder is charged with murder in the death of Dr. George Tiller, who was shot to death May 31 in his church in Wichita, Kansas. Prosecutor Ann Swegle urged jurors to convict Roeder, reminding the jury of the defendant's testimony Thursday. ""His testimony was delivered very matter-of-factly, but its contents were chillingly horrific,"" she said. ""He carried out a planned assassination, and there can be no other verdict in this case ... other than guilty."" Kim T. Park, chief deputy district attorney, told the jurors that Roeder's actions were unjustified and cowardly. ""Scott Roeder is not justified,"" she said. ""He is only and simply guilty of the crimes he is charged with."" Mark Rudy, a defense attorney for Roeder, told jurors that Roeder believed he had to act. ""Scott thought that the babies kept on dying,"" he said. ""Scott formed a belief that he had to stop George Tiller from killing more babies."" He admitted that Roeder killed Tiller but said only the jurors can decide if Roeder ""murdered"" Tiller. He said he was not asking jurors ""to check your common sense at the door"" and urged them to ""represent our little part of the nation well."" ""No defendant should ever be convicted based on his convictions,"" Rudy said. Roeder testified Thursday that he shot and killed Tiller and did not regret it. ""There was nothing being done, and the legal process had been exhausted, and these babies were dying every day,"" Roeder said. ""I felt that if someone did not do something, he was going to continue."" Tiller ran a women's clinic at which he performed abortions. Sedgwick County District Judge Warren Wilbert ruled after the end of testimony Thursday that the jury could not consider a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter against Roeder as the defense wanted. In making the ruling, Wilbert noted that Roeder had been talking about killing Tiller for 10 years, CNN affiliate WDAF reported. Several of Tiller's family members broke into tears as Roeder recounted the shooting. Roeder said he didn't regret what he did and felt ""a sense of relief"" when he learned that Tiller's clinic was shut down after his death. Roeder calmly testified that he thought about different ways to kill the doctor -- driving a car into his, perhaps, or shooting him with a rifle. He also considered cutting Tiller's hands off with a sword, but decided that would not be effective, as Tiller would still be able to train others. Tiller, 67, was one of the few U.S. doctors who performed late-term abortion procedures. He had already survived one attempt on his life before he was killed. He decided to kill Tiller at his church, he said, because ""I felt that actually if he was to be stopped, that was probably the only place he could have been stopped. ... It was the only window of opportunity I saw."" Roeder said he visited the church four or five times before Tiller's death. The week before the shooting, on May 24, he carried a .22-caliber handgun with him, he testified, but Tiller did not attend church that day. On May 31, though, the doctor was there, and ""I did what I thought was needed to be done to protect the children,"" Roeder said. ""I shot him."" ""The lives of those children were in imminent danger if someone did not stop George Tiller,"" he said. The defense had sought to have former Kansas Attorney General Phill Kline and current Deputy Attorney General Barry Disney testify, but the judge did not allow it. Kline unsuccessfully attempted to prosecute Tiller in 2006, and Disney charged Tiller with 19 misdemeanor counts, but a jury acquitted him. Wilbert said Roeder could testify about the cases and how they affected his beliefs, but to allow testimony from Kline would ""get into legal matters that do not concern this jury."" And, the judge said, the cases do not give Roeder a basis to state absolutely that Tiller's actions were illegal, since the doctor had never been convicted. Defense attorneys claim Roeder was led to shoot Tiller in part because of authorities' failure to punish him through the judicial system. Roeder testified he was ""very frustrated"" by Tiller's acquittal, saying it ""seemed like that was the last attempt by the state of Kansas to find if there was anything at all going on illegally in George Tiller's clinic."" Roeder could face life in prison if convicted of first-degree murder. He also is charged with two counts of aggravated assault for allegedly pointing his gun at two other ushers as he fled the church.","Scott Roeder accused of killing Dr. George Tiller at church in May 2009 .

"(CNN) -- Floyd Mayweather Junior has confirmed that he will fight WBA welterweight super champion Shane Mosley in Las Vegas on May 1 following the controversial collapse of his much-hyped showdown with Manny Pacquiao. The 38-year-old Mosley, a three-weight world title winner, had already signed up for the bout at the MGM Grand, which will take place under the Olympic-style random blood testing drug protocols that Pacquiao refused to accept. The undefeated Mayweather, a six-time world champion at five different weights and Pacquiao's chief rival for the pound-for-pound bragging stakes, said in a statement that he was looking forward to taking on his fellow American. ""This one is definitely for the fans as I wasn't going to waste anyone's time with a meaningless tune-up bout and asked to fight Shane immediately,"" the 32-year-old said. ""I have said ever since I came back to the sport that I only wanted to fight the best. I think Shane is one of the best, but come May 1, he still won't be great enough to beat me. Mosley had been due for a unification bout on January 30 with Andre Berto, who claimed the WBC title that Mayweather vacated when he retired in 2008, but the fight was scrapped when his opponent lost family members in the Haiti earthquake. ""I have always wanted to fight Floyd, and now it is finally coming true,"" Mosley said. ""I am already in great shape and ready to show everyone on May 1 that I am stronger, faster and better than he is. I will have no problem beating him."" Mosley's promoter Golden Boy took the chance to have a dig at Filipino star Pacquiao over his refusal to undergo blood testing in the lead-up to the planned fight with Mayweather. ""Shane Mosley is one of the greatest fighters of this era and I commend him for not only agreeing to the fight against Mayweather, but also agreeing to participate in a testing process that can only help the integrity of the sport,"" Golden Boy chief executive Richard Schaefer said. Leonard Ellerbe, his counterpart at Mayweather Promotions, also weighed in on the matter. ""Floyd has been trying to make this fight for the last 10 years, so he is extremely excited about the opportunity to face Shane. He can't wait to extend his undefeated record and perform at the highest level,"" Ellerbe said. ""More importantly, he is also happy to set the precedent for random blood testing in order to ensure fair and safe contests for all fighters.""

"Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- Just taking a sip of water or walking to the bathroom is excruciatingly painful for 15-year-old Michael Brewer, who was burned over 65 percent of his body after being set on fire, allegedly by a group of teenagers. ""It hurts my heart to see him in pain, but it enlightens at the same time to know my son is strong enough to make it through on a daily basis,"" his mother, Valerie Brewer, told CNN on Wednesday. Brewer and her husband, Michael Brewer, Sr., spoke to CNN's Tony Harris, a day after a 13-year-old boy who witnessed last month's attack publicly read a written statement: . ""I want to express my deepest sympathy to Mikey and his family,"" Jeremy Jarvis said. ""I will pray for Mikey to grow stronger every day and for Mikey's speedy recovery."" Jarvis' older brother has been charged in the October 12 attack in Deerfield Beach, Florida. When asked about the teen's statement, Valerie Brewer -- who knows the Jarvis family -- said she ""can't focus on that."" ""I would really like to stay away from that because that brings negative energy to me and I don't need that right now,"" she said. Her son remains in guarded condition at the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center. He suffered second- and third-degree burns over about two-thirds of his body, according to the hospital's associate director, Dr. Carl Schulman. The teen faces a lifelong recovery from his injuries, Schulman told CNN's Harris. ""Michael's still got a lot of major surgery ahead of him, a lot of rehabilitation and therapy,"" Schulman said. ""He's doing about as well as could be expected at this point in his recovery, but he's got a period of probably several weeks to a couple of months still left in the hospital if everything goes well, but the recovery is lifelong. This is truly a life-changing event."" Valerie Brewer said her son's treatment is excruciating at times. Physical therapy, she said, is ""incredibly painful. He almost cries because it's so painful. He's burned badly on the backs of his knees and every time he moves his knee, it pulls, and if it's healing, it pulls the scab and it cracks, and it starts to bleed."" The boy must undergo hour-and-a-half showers, she said, where ""they take a piece of gauze, and they wipe off all the dead skin. They give him painkillers for that, but it's incredibly painful and it breaks my heart every time they have to do it. ... That's what we call the torture hour."" Heavy metal musician Ozzy Osbourne sent Brewer a CD, and he plays it on a boom box during the showers, she said. ""He focuses on Ozzy, and he gets through his torture hour."" Police were able to interview Brewer on Monday for the first time since the incident. Hospital officials have said Brewer can communicate only in one- or two-word answers. Valerie Brewer would not go into details about what her son told investigators, but said that ""he answered the questions they asked."" The interview was emotional for both the teen and the investigators, according to Maria Schneider, a prosecutor with the state attorney's office in Broward County. ""It was difficult for him to talk about. Difficult for us to listen to,"" she said of the interview. ""Just difficult all around, heart-wrenching. He's doing so much better, but it's such a terrible situation."" Denver Jarvis and Matthew Bent, both 15, are accused along with a third teen, Jesus Mendez, 16, of being in a group that poured alcohol over Brewer and set him ablaze in a dispute over $40, a video game and a bicycle. All three pleaded not guilty in an appearance last week in Broward County Circuit Court. If convicted, they would face a sentence of up to 30 years in prison. Detectives say eyewitnesses told them that Mendez used a lighter to set fire to Brewer after Jarvis allegedly poured alcohol over him. Bent allegedly encouraged the attack, police said. Brewer jumped into a pool at his apartment complex to put out the flames. Authorities have said Mendez admitted setting Brewer on fire. According to an arrest transcript, the boy said he made a ""bad decision."" Jeremy Jarvis was arrested as a juvenile after Brewer was burned and spent about 30 days in juvenile detention. However, prosecutors have not filed charges against him and are still determining how to proceed. He still could be charged, as prosecutors have 90 days from his arrest to decide whether to move forward with the case. He has not been interviewed by police or prosecutors, Schneider said. ""He has invoked his rights to counsel and has invoked his rights to silence,"" she said. The boy's attorney, Stephen Melnick, said it appears the younger Jarvis was only a witness to the attack. Broward County schools expelled the seventh-grader after his arrest and he is currently being home-schooled, Melnick said.

Valerie Brewer said it was ""heartbreaking"" when she and her husband learned that her son's attackers may have included kids that they knew. ""But we don't focus on that,"" she added. ""We focus strictly on Michael and his recovery. We don't need any negative energy coming into the recovery so we just stay away from it, period.

Her son's recovery has been filled with ups and downs, she said. ""It's been a roller coaster ride, the fear of the unknown,"" she said. ""The first time he spoke to us was joyous but watching him struggle every single day ... ""I'm proud of him, I'm very, very proud of him, 'cause I don't think I could do what he's doing.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has refused a lower court's unusual request to decide whether a shocking 45-year-old civil rights crime can be prosecuted decades later. The justices Monday dismissed an appeal involving James Ford Seale, convicted in the 1964 kidnapping of two teenagers whose bodies were found in a backwater area of the Mississippi River. The reputed former Ku Klux Klan member had long been suspected in the crime, but it was officially unsolved until Seale was indicted in 2007, and later convicted. He is serving three life sentences. The move by the high court not to get involved keeps in place Seale's original indictment, but does not resolve the larger question of whether similar cases can be prosecuted. The issue could have enormous implications for several dozen ""cold cases"" involving racially motivated crimes dating back to the 1950s. Seale had appealed his conviction, claiming the statute of limitations had expired five years after the crime. The confusion arises over the fact that kidnapping could be considered a capital offense in 1964, and thus had no time limit for a prosecution. The high court in 1968 eliminated the federal death penalty for that crime, and Congress four years later changed the law to reflect that ruling. But lawmakers 15 years ago reinstated kidnapping as death penalty-eligible. So the justices were being asked to decide when the statute of limitations kicked in, if ever. Justice John Paul Stevens, supported by his conservative colleague Justice Antonin Scalia, thought the court should get involved. ""I see no benefit and significant cost to postponing the question's resolution,"" Stevens wrote in dissent. ""A prompt answer from this court will expedite the termination of this litigation and determine whether other similar cases may be prosecuted."" Seale, a former sheriff's deputy, was convicted in June 2007 of kidnapping and conspiracy in the disappearances of Charles Eddie Moore and Henry Hezekiah Dee, both 19. Federal officials had initially trumpeted reopening the Seale case. ""Today's indictment is one example of the FBI's strong and ongoing commitment to re-examining and investigating unsolved civil rights era murders and other crimes,"" FBI Director Robert S. Mueller said in January 2007. ""Under our Cold Case Initiative, we will continue to identify and pursue these cases of racially motivated violence to ensure justice is served wherever possible."" Seale was not tried for murder, but prosecutors alleged that he and fellow Klansmen conspired to abduct, beat and murder Dee and Moore in May 1964. An indictment accused Seale and his cohorts of picking up the two men hitchhiking and driving them into the Homochitto National Forest in Franklin County, Mississippi, where the teenagers were beaten and interrogated at gunpoint. Dee and Moore were then bound with duct tape and weighted down by an engine block and railroad rail. They were still alive when they were thrown into the Old Mississippi River, where they drowned, according to the FBI. Their decomposed bodies were found two months later during a search for three other missing civil rights workers that would later be known as the Mississippi Burning case. Seale and another man, Charles Edwards, were arrested in the slayings in 1964, but were released on bond and never tried. The FBI turned the case over to local authorities, and the investigation was dropped after a justice of the peace said witnesses had refused to testify. The case was revived in 2007 when Moore's brother -- during a visit to Franklin County to help research the case for a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation documentary -- discovered Seale was still alive. Thomas Moore told CNN in January 2007 that he gave the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi FBI files on the case, which he had obtained from a Mississippi reporter. U.S. Attorney Dunn Lampton helped form a task force that led to Seale's indictment. Seale was the only person convicted in the Moore and Dee murders, the Justice Department said. Since then, other notable cold cases from the civil rights era also have gone to trial. In 2005, Edgar Ray Killen was convicted of manslaughter for his role in the Mississippi Burning case. Adding to the unusual nature of the Seale case is that a lower court was unable to decide the matter. The full 18-judge panel on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals split evenly on the time-limit question. They then asked the high court to ""certify"" the question, a rarely used procedure that essentially asks the justices about how to proceed. The Supreme Court was under no obligation to accept the case in this fashion, under its ""Rule 19."" That provision gives appeals courts the discretion to hand off to the high court ""any question of law in any civil or criminal case as to which instructions are desired, and upon such certification the Supreme Court may give binding instructions or require the entire record to be sent up for decision of the entire matter in controversy."" The case is U.S. v. Seale (09-166).","Appeals court asked high court if a civil rights crime can be prosecuted decades later .

"(CNN) -- The U.S.-led war against the Taliban in Afghanistan has been a tough slog, a nearly eight-year conflict replete with gloom. U.S. Staff Sergeant Robert Brunner secures an area in the Baraki Barak district of Logar Province on August 22. Lately a lot of the news from Afghanistan seems particularly grim for the United States and its allies. More U.S. troops have been killed there in August than in any month since the war began. There are indications that more U.S. troops could be deployed to the country. The Afghan presidential elections this month were rife with charges of fraud. Corruption plagues the political system. The poppy trade is flourishing. And, in the words of the top U.S. military official, Adm. Mike Mullen, the ""Taliban insurgency has gotten better, more sophisticated."" Support for the war hit a new low among Americans, a CNN poll found this month. So why do the United States and its allies continue to pour money and troops into Afghanistan? ""The importance of the place is pretty substantial,"" said Michael O'Hanlon, senior fellow for foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. Al Qaeda has used that part of the world as a sanctuary, he said. Neighboring Pakistan has been serious about vanquishing the militants there and that helps the fight against militants in Afghanistan. A victory for al Qaeda in a conflict there would represent an important public relations triumph for the militants, he said. He understands why Americans are displeased but said people need to feel that progress is being made in the region. ""We haven't been winning for eight years,"" O'Hanlon said. ""They want to know why."" U.S. President Barack Obama has tackled the question head-on. The al Qaeda and Taliban militants in Afghanistan and Pakistan represent an urgent threat to the United States, he said in March, just as they were when al Qaeda attacked the United States in 2001, when the then-ruling Taliban harbored the terror network. ""Many people in the United States -- and many in partner countries that have sacrificed so much -- have a simple question: What is our purpose in Afghanistan?"" the president said. ""After so many years, they ask, why do our men and women still fight and die there? And they deserve a straightforward answer. ""So let me be clear: Al Qaeda and its allies -- the terrorists who planned and supported the 9/11 attacks -- are in Pakistan and Afghanistan. ""Multiple intelligence estimates have warned that al Qaeda is actively planning attacks on the United States homeland from its safe haven in Pakistan. And if the Afghan government falls to the Taliban -- or allows al Qaeda to go unchallenged -- that country will again be a base for terrorists who want to kill as many of our people as they possibly can."" The questions have come up in Britain, too, where the deaths of 15 British troops in July stirred outrage and criticism of Britain's strategy in Afghanistan. Prime Minister Gordon Brown told his countrymen that British involvement in that country now is as crucial as it was after the 2001 terrorist attacks. ""In 2001 the case for intervention in Afghanistan was to take on a global terrorist threat and prevent terrorist attacks in Britain and across the world,"" he said. ""In 2009 the overriding reason for our continued involvement is the same -- to take on, at its source, the terrorist threat, and prevent attacks here and elsewhere."" Obama said the Afghan insurgency ""feeds instability"" in Pakistan and Pakistan extremists have the proven ability to undermine the Afghan government. He cited the importance of confronting the heroin trade that finances the insurgency. Obama has listed several objectives in dealing with Afghanistan and Pakistan, such as promoting an accountable Afghan government and self-reliant security forces, developing a stable government and strong economy in Pakistan, and disrupting terror networks. Pakistani security forces have been battling militants in the northwestern part of the country, and drone strikes thought to be conducted by the United States have been carried out from Afghanistan against militants in Pakistan. ""The future of Afghanistan is inextricably linked to the future of its neighbor, Pakistan,"" Obama said. ""In the nearly eight years since 9/11, al Qaeda and its extremist allies have moved across the border to the remote areas of the Pakistani frontier. ""This almost certainly includes al Qaeda's leadership: Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri. They have used this mountainous terrain as a safe haven to hide, to train terrorists, to communicate with followers, to plot attacks, and to send fighters to support the insurgency in Afghanistan. For the American people, this border region has become the most dangerous place in the world."" In Britain, Brown said the military effort to clear a region and establish security would be buttressed by Afghan plans ""to build basic services -- clean water, electricity, roads, basic justice, basic health care, and then economic development."" ""This inevitably takes time, but the important thing is that work has begun, to give the people a stake in the future,"" he said. U.S. Sen. Jim Webb, Democrat-Virginia, said in a recent TV interview that he has ""a lot of concerns about the way we've articulated our national goals in Afghanistan."" ""I think that it is extremely important for us to be able to articulate the end point of our strategy, just as it was in Iraq,"" he said. While there is grim news on the ground in Afghanistan, the picture painted by the president in March was a red alert for Americans: It's a tough but necessary fight that requires patience and resources. ""There are no quick fixes to achieve U.S. national security interests in Afghanistan and Pakistan,"" Obama said. ""The danger of failure is real and the implications are grave.""","Number of U.S. military deaths in August stands at 46, highest monthly toll .

"(CNN) -- Indian batsman Virender Sehwag admitted he was not too disappointed after he fell seven agonising runs short of a world record third triple-century in the third Test against Sri Lanka. The 31-year-old opener had moved from his overnight score of 284 to 293 before he chipped a flighted delivery from Muttiah Muralitharan back to the bowler who claimed the catch at the second attempt. ""I am very happy I got at least 293 runs -- I am proud of what I have achieved,"" Sehwag told reporters at the close of the third day's play. ""Not many people have got two triple centuries and followed that with 293. So there is nothing to be disappointed about. ""I tried to take my time, but maybe the ball was not there to be hit. I misjudged the length and the ball went straight into Murali's hands. ""I always tell myself to bat the full day, and if there is a ball to be hit, just hit it. If I'm able to bat the whole day we will be in a good position."" The innings, which lasted 254 balls and included 40 boundaries and seven sixes, was the backbone of India's highest-ever total of 726-9 declared in reply to Sri Lanka's 393. India skipper Mahendra Dhoni hit an unbeaten century before he opted to declare with a lead of 333 before Sri Lanka saw off a difficult few overs in their second innings to close on 11 without loss. Elsewhere, England claimed a 2-1 series victory over South Africa in Durban after the fifth one-day international was abandoned without a ball being bowled.

"(CNN) -- Those who knew Canadian folk musician Taylor Mitchell say her passion for her craft was matched by her affinity for nature. Fresh out of high school, she embarked upon a three-week tour of Eastern Canada earlier this month full of hope over her blossoming career and excited to explore the region with a new car and driver's license. The 19-year-old rising star was in between gigs when, according to a Nova Scotia Cape Breton Highlands National Park official, she was killed by coyotes during a hike on Tuesday afternoon. ""If there can be any comfort at all, it is knowing that Taylor was doing two of the things she loved most, sharing story and song on the road and spending time in nature's fold,"" her manager, Lisa Weitz said in an e-mail. ""She loved the woods and had a deep affinity for their beauty and serenity."" Mitchell was a ""seasoned naturalist"" well versed in wilderness camping who wouldn't want the coyotes responsible for her death to be killed, her mother said Thursday. ""When the decision had been made to kill the pack of coyotes, I clearly heard Taylor's voice say, 'please don't, this is their space.' She wouldn't have wanted their demise, especially as a result of her own. She was passionate about animals, was an environmentalist and was also planning to volunteer at the Toronto Wildlife Centre in the coming months,"" Emily Mitchell said in a statement Thursday. ""Tragically, it was her time to be taken from us so soon,"" the mother said. When she was 15, Mitchell began vocal lessons with her future producer, Michael Johnston. ""Taylor inspired and impressed everyone from her musical peers to members of the Canadian roots-music community who were two and three times her age,"" he said in a statement. ""They saw in her the rarest of the gifts -- an ability to sing not only from the heart, but in a way that transcended her age and experience and became something universal."" The Toronto-based musician's career began to take off earlier this year after the April release of her debut album, ""For Your Consideration."" She was nominated for Young Performer of the Year honors by the Canadian Folk Music Awards, which will be awarded in November. On her Facebook page, she detailed her busy summer performance schedule, describing it as her ""craziest summer yet."" In July, she said she took a Greyhound bus to perform in the Young Performers Program at the Winnipeg Folk Festival, her first show west of Ontario, which featured acts including Arlo Guthrie, Neko Case and Elvis Costello. She played more shows in the Toronto area, relishing the airplay her album was receiving, and worked on songs for her next album, Weitz said. Yet she managed to return to nature with her aunt, mother and best friend at the family cottage in Owen Sound, Ontario, delighting in its simple joys. ""Our cottage is on the shores of Georgian bay. It's 125 years old with three bedrooms that sleep two and one bedroom that sleeps four, plus a bunkhouse. It's old and creaky and absolutely beautiful. As I sit on my couch in my apartment, I'm homesick for the precariously slanted stairs, tennis courts, lake and wonderful memories,"" Mitchell said on her Facebook page. Before she set out eastward for her tour of the Maritimes, she shared her works in progress at the Ontario Council of Folk Music conference in Ottawa, impressing all those in attendance, Weitz said. ""Taylor Mitchell's vocal style and consummate songwriting craft belied her vernal years. Indeed, her songs told the tales of a seeker, a sojourner with a sage wisdom atypical of most, let alone one of such tender years,"" Weitz said. On her Facebook page, she had begun counting down the days to her East Coast tour in September, saying in a September 18 status update that she was ""feeling the pull of the road."" In her last post on the site, she described playing a show in someone's home, calling it ""a welcome dose of normality after a whirlwind weekend"" at the Ontario Council of Folk Music. Those closest to her said they'll derive inspiration from her passion for life. ""Taylor was my shining light, my baby, my confidante and best friend,"" her mother said. ""I don't know how to move forward from here but I know that she would want that for me, and I will try to do that in her memory and celebrate her life in the way she lived it -- with passion, commitment and an unbridled loving heart.""","Taylor Mitchell was a ""seasoned naturalist"" versed in wilderness camping, mother says .

"(CNN) -- Nineteen former patients at a Denver, Colorado, hospital have tested positive for hepatitis C, federal prosecutors said Thursday as they announced new charges against a former hospital employee accused of exposing the patients to the virus. A hospital worker is accused of injecting herself and using unclean syringes for patients. Prosecutors charged Kristen Diane Parker with 21 counts of tampering with a consumer product and another 21 counts of obtaining a controlled substance by deceit or subterfuge, according to an indictment. Parker, 26, had previously faced three federal counts from earlier this month. Parker, who worked as a surgical technician at Rose Medical Center in Denver, is accused of injecting herself with syringes that held patients' pain medication Fentanyl, then replacing the pain medication in the syringes with saline, according to a statement from the office of the U.S. attorney for Colorado. In a statement to police during the investigation, Parker said, ""I can't take back what I did, but I will have to live with it for the rest of my life, and so does everyone else."" Parker's attorney did not return a call from CNN on Thursday. Authorities said Parker knew she had hepatitis C, a contagious liver disease. Hepatitis C can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Parker believes she contracted the virus through using heroin and sharing needles with other users while she lived in New Jersey in 2008, authorities said. According to an affidavit filed by an investigator with the Food and Drug Administration, Rose Medical Center knew Parker tested positive for hepatitis C. She was counseled on how to limit her exposure to patients. Parker worked at Rose Medical Center from October 2008 to April 2009, said Jeff Dorschner, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney for Colorado. Parker's employment was terminated after she failed a hospital-ordered drug test, said Leslie Teegarden, spokeswoman for Rose Medical Center. The tests were ordered after co-workers reported ""suspicious behavior,""  Teegarden said Thursday. Rose Medical Center contacted about 4,700 patients who may have been exposed to the virus, according to a statement on the center's Web site. Of those patients, 3,540 have been tested thus far, Teegarden said. She said the hospital plans to use tamper-resistant, pre-filled Fentanyl syringes to prevent intentional contaminations. Parker also worked at Northern Westchester Hospital in New York and Audubon Ambulatory Surgical Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Prosecutors have not charged her with any crimes related to her employment at the other two facilities. About 1,200 patients may have been exposed between May 4 and July 1 of this year, when Parker worked at Audubon, according to the center's Web site. As of last week, 545 of Audobon's former patients had been tested for the virus, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. One patient tested positive for hepatitis C, but that infection could not be linked to Parker, according to the department's Web site. Nearly 1,000 patients had been tested as of Thursday, said Audubon spokeswoman Amy Triandiflou. Details about what Parker may have done to expose Audubon patients to the virus are still sketchy, Triandiflou said. More than 2,700 patients could have been exposed at Northern Westchester Hospital, according to the hospital's Web site. The site did not indicate whether any infections had been detected. There is no vaccine for hepatitis C. If Parker is convicted and if any one of the former patients suffers serious bodily injury because of her actions, she could face a maximum of 20 years in federal prison, prosecutors said. If she is convicted and if any one of the former patients dies as a result of the infection, she could be sentenced to life in prison, according to prosecutors. CNN's Jim Spellman contributed to this report.","Denver, Colorado, hospital worker accused of exposing patients to hepatitis C .

"(CNN)  -- Officials warned Wednesday that the bridge linking the California cities of San Francisco and Oakland will likely remain closed Thursday morning, promising more delays for Bay Area commuters. That work is intended to dampen vibration on the structure. Vibration may have played a role in causing pieces of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge to fall Tuesday night from the span onto the roadway, resulting in its closure. The 73-year-old bridge spans the San Francisco Bay and carries an average 280,000 vehicles daily, according to the state's Transportation Department. ""Right now, we do not have a time when the bridge will potentially open,"" said Bart Ney, a spokesman for California Department of Transportation. ""The work has to be completed first."" Once the new steel is in place and the rods have been made tense, at least three hours of testing will be carried out before the bridge will reopen to vehicular traffic, Ney said, refusing to speculate on when that might occur. ""The first thing that I would say to motorists is that you need to be at this point planning other routes over the next day or so,"" he said. The Federal Highway Administration and the Seismic Peer Review Board are scrutinizing the repair plans, he said. Wednesday's commute was a horror show for many. ""My wife actually drives over to the peninsula; she says it's taken her two hours to get to work so far and she's not there yet,"" commuter Seth Carp told CNN affiliate KTVU as he prepared to board a Bay Area Rapid Transit train. ""I tried to take the Golden Gate Bridge,"" said a woman who identified herself only as Yemi. ""It was a big mistake."" She gave up and wound up taking BART. ""It was back-to-back bumper, there were rows of cars everywhere,"" said Christina Chou, who lives in Foster City near the San Mateo Bridge, which served as an alternate route for many. ""It was just horrible."" Ridership increased on ferries, too, with some people finding a silver lining to the snafu. ""I have been looking for an opportunity to go across the bay in the ferry,"" said Jack Pierce of Oakland. ""I'm sorry the cable parted, but I am glad to get the opportunity."" Ney said wind gusts of up to 50 mph slowed repair efforts on Tuesday, but the winds had diminished by Wednesday evening. Winds increased vibration by the rods that were fatigued and ultimately failed, he said. ""It was a contributing factor, but not necessarily the only factor, and we are analyzing what the factors are right now,"" he said. Travelers flocked to BART, which ran longer trains and extra trains. The rail line was on track to exceed its peak ridership of 405,000 in a single day, said BART spokesman Linton Johnson. Were you there? Send photos and video . ""We have called in extra personnel to help us make sure we operate with every available train car we have in order to provide as much capacity as possible,"" said BART's assistant general manager of operations, Paul Oversier. Amtrak was running a shuttle between the San Francisco and Martinez stations for Coast Starlight and California Zephyr passengers. The pieces that fell -- a cross beam and tie rods -- came from the same section that was repaired in September over Labor Day weekend, when crews worked almost around the clock to fix a crack in the span. A 50-foot section of the bridge collapsed in 1989 during the Loma Prieta earthquake, killing one person and prompting efforts to make it quake-tolerant. The whole Bay Bridge is slated to be replaced in 2013, said Patrick Siegman, a transportation planner at Nelson Nygaard Consulting Associates, a national transportation planning firm based in San Francisco. The bridge is ""really showing its age,"" he said. ""It's kind of a race against time to finish the new bridge before the next quake hits.""","San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge closes after parts of it fall to roadway .

"One doctor says the study ""very clearly shows that autism did not arrive through a vaccine."" A new study published in the January 2008 issue of Archives of General Psychiatry found the prevalence of autism cases in California children continued to rise after most vaccine manufacturers started to remove the mercury-based preservative thimerosal in 1999, suggesting that the chemical was not a primary cause of the disorder. Researchers from the State Public Health Department found that the autism rates in children rose continuously during the study period from 1995 to 2007. The preservative, thimerosal, has not been used in childhood vaccines since 2001, except for some flu shots. The latest findings failed to convince some parents and advocacy groups, who have long blamed mercury, a neurotoxin, for the disorder. For years, parents have been concerned that a mercury-containing vaccine preservative may play a role in autism. But a study conducted in California found that autism rates increased even after thimerosal was removed from most vaccines. The study authors say this is evidence that thimerosal does not cause autism, although advocacy groups say it's too soon to determine whether autism rates have been affected. Do these findings suggest that autism isn't linked to mercury in vaccines? Dr. Sanjay Gupta, chief medical correspondent: Let me explain. In 1999, manufacturers began removing thimerosal - which is a mercury-based preservative - from vaccines. Some people believed autism would decrease as a result, because they thought the two were connected. A new study in the Archives of General Psychiatry says this just didn't happen. Researchers looked at cases of autism in California after 1999. They reasoned that if mercury exposure in vaccines was a major cause of autism, the number of affected kids should have dropped after thimerosal was removed. Just the opposite happened. From 2004 to 2007, when exposure to thimerosal dropped significantly for 3- to 5-year-olds, the autism rate continued to go up, from 3 per 1,000 children to 4 per 1,000 children in California. A child psychiatrist who supported the study said it ""very clearly shows that autism did not arrive through a vaccine."" But advocacy groups say it's too soon to determine whether autism rates were affected by removing thimerosal from vaccines. The National Vaccine Information Center says the study doesn't include children under the age of 3, which they say is the only group that was never exposed to mercury in vaccines. It says thimerosal wasn't completely off the shelves until 2002 or 2003. Their main point is that mercury is a neurotoxin, so why take a chance by putting it in vaccines? What do scientists think causes autism? As many as one in every 166 children in this country is found to have autism, and doctors still don't know why. Doctors point to genetics and environment as culprits, but it could be more complicated than that. The latest research shows these children are not necessarily born with autism but with the potential to develop it. What exactly are these outside factors? It's hard to pinpoint. What we eat, what we breathe, what we drink -- all these things could play a role. Some doctors say the increase is due to a change in the way the condition is diagnosed  kids who were once labeled mentally retarded are now being labeled as autistic. What are possible signs of autism in your child? Doctors are now looking for signs of autism in children as young as 18 to 24 months. Some red flags that indicate your child may have autism: no babbling or pointing by 12 months, no single words by 16 months, no brief phrases by 24 months, loss of language or social skills. If you see any of these signs, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends seeing a pediatric neurologist, developmental pediatrician or child psychologist. What led companies to remove thimerosal from vaccines to begin with? Several things pushed companies in this direction. Over the past decade, more and more attention was given to the health effects of mercury on humans. And then in the '90s, the CDC added new vaccines to the list of routine shots that children should get. Some of them used thimerosal as a preservative. This was happening while the government was trying to decrease our exposure to mercury. So the FDA began looking into the issue. In 1997, Congress passed a bill that mandated review of products containing mercury, which led manufacturers to begin removing thimerosal from vaccines two years later.",Removal of thimerosal from most vaccines hasn't reduced the number of autism cases diagnosed in the state of California.
"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Friday she did not come to Pakistan for ""happy talk."" Her three-day trip is aimed at getting frank, open discussions going about the fight against terrorism, and that includes presenting U.S. concerns about how much success Pakistan is having, she said. In an interview with CNN, Clinton said it's time to ""clear the air"" with a key U.S. ally. She added, ""I don't think the way you deal with negative feelings is to pretend they're not there."" ""I think it's important, if we are going to have the kind of cooperative partnership, that I think is in the best interest of both of our countries, for me to express some of the questions that are on the minds of the American people,"" Clinton told CNN's Jill Dougherty. The secretary's comments came a day after she seemed to question the commitment of some in the Pakistani government for going after the leaders of al Qaeda, who U.S. intelligence experts believe are taking refuge in Pakistan's remote tribal areas. ""Al Qaeda has had safe haven in Pakistan since 2002,"" she told a group of Pakistani journalists Thursday. ""I find it hard to believe that nobody in your government knows where they are and couldn't get them if they really wanted to."" She added, ""Maybe they're not gettable. I don't know."" In the CNN interview Friday, Clinton said she was not suggesting that someone inside the government might be complicit with al Qaeda or might be failing to follow through in fighting the terrorist group. ""No, no,"" she said. ""What I was responding to is what I have been really doing on this trip, which is there exists a trust deficit, certainly on the part of Pakistanis toward the United States, toward our intentions and our actions. And yet we have so much in common, we face a common threat. We certainly have a common enemy in extremism and terrorism, and so part of what I have been doing is answering every single charge, every question."" Trust ""is a two-way street,"" she added. While Pakistan's military operation has been ""extremely courageous in both Swat and now in South Waziristan, success there is not sufficient,"" she said. ""... I just want to keep putting on the table that we have some concerns as well. And I think ... that's the kind of relationship I'm looking to build here."" Asked whether she had underestimated the level of anti-American sentiment in Pakistan, Clinton said, ""No, because I've been following the research and the polling that's gone on for a couple of years. I knew that we were inheriting a pretty negative situation that we were going to have to address."" That's why she wanted three days in the country, ""a long trip for a secretary of state,"" she said. ""I wanted to demonstrate that, look, we are not coming here claiming that everything we've done is perfect. I've admitted to mistakes by our country going back in time, but I've also reminded people that we've been partners and allies from the beginning of Pakistan's inception as a country. Pakistan has helped us on several important occasions, and we are very grateful for that. So let's begin to clear the air here."" Clinton also commented on Iran, as the United States seeks clarification on whether the nation will agree to a deal brokered by the International Atomic Energy Agency aimed at resolving a dispute about Iran's nuclear program. ""I am going to let the process play out, but clearly we are working to determine exactly what they are willing to do,"" Clinton said. The secretary made a vow to Israeli and Palestinian leaders during the CNN interview as well. ""We're going to do everything we can to try to clear away whatever concerns that the parties have, to actually get them into negotiations where they then can thrash out all of these difficult issues,"" she said. ""I think I'm pretty realistic about what has to be overcome for there to be the level of acceptance that is required to get into these negotiations,"" she added. ""But remember, prior to negotiations, people stake out all kinds of positions, and then in the caldron of actually getting down to specifics, that all begins to be worked out."" She referred to the experience of former President Bill Clinton. ""I watched in the '90s as my husband just kept pushing and pushing and pushing, and good things happened. There wasn't a final agreement, but fewer people died, there were more opportunities for economic development, for trade, for exchanges. It had positive effects, even though it didn't cross the finish line. So I think that being involved at the highest levels sends a message of our seriousness of purpose.""","Hillary Clinton says she aims to address questions that Americans are thinking about .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Chinese government increased its harassment of religious minorities before the Olympic Games, according to a U.S. State Department report released Friday. A Tibetan Buddhist monk in southwest China's Sichuan province. The State Department's Annual Report on Religious Freedom singled  out China, Myanmar, North Korea, Iran, Sudan, Eritrea, Saudi Arabia and Uzbekistan to ""blacklist"" because they are ""countries of particular concern"" when it comes to religious oppression. Over the past year, ""repression of religious freedom intensified in some areas"" in China, including in the Tibetan region and in Xinjiang province, where the Uighur Muslims live. As the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games approached, some unregistered Protestant religious groups in Beijing reported intensified harassment from government authorities and said the government cracked down on home churches, the report says. The State Department found that over the past year, Chinese officials also detained and interrogated several foreigners about their religious activities, alleged that the foreigners had engaged in ""illegal religious activities"" and canceled their visas. The government also undertook a ""patriotic education campaign,"" which required monks and nuns to sign statements personally denouncing the Dalai Lama. As a result, the reports says, protests led to violence in Lhasa, Tibet, in March, and the government detained an unknown number of monks and nuns or expelled them from monasteries. In addition to its continued crackdown on groups such as the Falun Gong, which China considers a ""cult,"" the government harassed Uighur Muslims and confiscated some of their passports to prevent their taking part in the hajj, the pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. Once again, the U.S. criticized the government of Myanmar, saying its ""repressive, authoritarian military regime"" had ""imposed restrictions on certain religious activities and frequently committed abuses of the right to freedom of religion."" Most followers of registered religions were permitted to worship as they chose, but the government infiltrated and monitored activities of virtually all organizations, including religious ones. The report says that although the North Korean constitution provides for religious freedom, ""genuine religious freedom does not exist, and there was no change in the extremely poor level of respect for religious freedom"" over the past year. In Iran, the report says, ""continued deterioration of the poor status of respect for religious freedom"" last year. ""Government actions and rhetoric created a threatening atmosphere for nearly all non-Shia religious groups, most notably for Baha'is, as well as Sufi Muslims, evangelical Christians, and members of the Jewish community,"" the report says. ""Government-controlled media intensified negative campaigns against religious minorities, particularly the Baha'is. Reports of imprisonment, harassment, intimidation, and discrimination based on religious beliefs continued."" The State Department found some progress in Saudi Arabia. ""While overall government policies continue to place severe restrictions on religious freedom, there were incremental improvements in specific areas,"" the report says. However, the report goes on to note that ""Non-Muslims and Muslims who do not adhere to the government's interpretation of Islam continued to face significant political, economic, legal, social, and religious discrimination."" It also criticizes U.S. allies in Pakistan and Jordan for aggressiveness toward religious minorities. The governments of Iraq and Afghanistan were praised for endorsing religious freedom, but the State Department found that the war-torn countries have problems. In Afghanistan, ""the residual effects of years of Taliban rule, popular suspicion regarding outside influence of foreigners, and weak democratic institutions hinder the respect for religious freedom."" In Iraq, ""violence conducted by terrorists, extremists, and criminal gangs restricted the free exercise of religion and posed a significant threat to the country's vulnerable religious minorities."" In releasing the report, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said the United States is ""concerned by efforts to promote a so-called defamation of religions concept,"" which has been the focus of numerous resolutions passed at the United Nations. She was referring to the Organization of Islamic Conference, a grouping of 57 Muslim states that does not recognize the right of individuals to freely change their religion and has prevented consensus on resolutions at the United Nations that would prohibit defamation of all religions, not just Islam. ""Despite a pretense of protecting religious practice and promoting tolerance, the flawed concept attempts to limit freedom of religion and restrict the rights of all individuals to disagree with or criticize religion, in particular Islam,"" the report says. ""Instead of protecting religion practice and promoting tolerance, this concept seeks to limit freedom of speech, and that could undermine the standards of international religious freedom,"" Rice said.","Myanmar, North Korea, Iran, Sudan, Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan ""blacklisted""

"(AOL Autos) -- Over the decades, I've interviewed dozens of automotive engineers; engine engineers, transmission engineers, chemical engineers, tire engineers, etc. But never have I interviewed an engineer quite like Ford's Cristina Rodriguez. Cristina Rodriguez has been with the Ford Motor Company for 12 years. What separates Crissy (what she prefers to be called at work) from other engineers is that it seems as though she was born be where she is today; the Vehicle Dynamics Development Engineer of the 2010 Ford Taurus. The Taurus goes on sale this summer, and it is arguably the most important vehicle Ford announces this year. This thirty-something Puerto Rican is the only woman at Ford Motor Company to have achieved her status as a Vehicle Dynamics Development Engineer. The job is equal parts engineer, race driver and vehicle psychologist. ""As an engineer, I need to make sure the car is safe,"" Rodriguez said. ""As a (race) driver I have to make sure the car handles well. And then I have to tune the car to have the right personality for being the latest Ford."" AOL Autos: Best sedans under $30K . She goes on to define what how cars exhibit personality. ""Some cars have a more relaxed personality, so everything about the way they drive is soft and slower to react,"" she said. ""Fords have a DNA that is sportier, more fun to drive, more responsive, more alive, so they need to feel that way."" You'll be able to tell whether Rodriguez has done her job well when you get behind the wheel of the new Taurus. While we didn't get to drive the new Taurus, we did get an opportunity to ride in the high-performance Taurus SHO model at Ford Motor Company's Dearborn, Michigan proving grounds (a special test track for developing new cars and trucks). More on that experience later. AOL Autos: Best and worst automotive designs . Preparing for success . Rodriguez told us about her background in the automotive business. ""I've grown into this job because Ford's engineering group works on a model that emphasizes 'technical maturity.'""  AOL Autos: First drive of the 2010 Chevy Camaro . For Rodriguez, this means that because she first possessed the technical background for the job, she was then able to develop and prove her practical skills on her way to becoming one of the company's most influential engineers. She's been with Ford 12 years. Matter-of-factly, Rodriguez elaborates. ""In this job, your body has to become a precisely calibrated instrument that can understand what the car's mechanicals are doing,"" she said. ""It takes a while to tune your body, but I've been working on this particular chassis for eight years, so I really know what it's capable of and how to make it respond."" While the 2010 Taurus is an all-new vehicle, it is related to other Ford products (the Lincoln MKS, Ford Flex, and the outgoing Ford Five Hundred/Taurus). Rodriguez also contributed to the ride and handling on those vehicles, a task that began with the Ford Five Hundred back in 2001. Born to Cuban parents who fled Castro's communist regime, Rodriguez grew up in Puerto Rico. ""I learned to be a methodical thinker from my father, who was a chemical engineer,"" she said. ""But it was my mother who was the mechanical one. She encouraged me when I was growing up to figure out how things worked, and she never got too mad at me when I put things back together and still had a few pieces left over."" While Rodriguez worked on her motor skills, another aspect of her life laid groundwork for her future success. ""I come from a very athletic family,"" she said. ""My grandfathers and uncles played Olympic basketball, so we were always active. I can remember that when my brother enrolled in little league baseball, he didn't want to join without a friend, so my mother enrolled me with him. I was the only girl in the league."" We doubt Rodriguez throws like a girl. And if you thought we'd make a joke about her driving like a woman? Think again. We doubt anyone could keep up with her on a track, male or female. Regarding her education, her Bachelors in engineering came from Georgia Institute of Technology. She also earned a Masters from The University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Mechanical engineering is a heavily male-dominated career path, but this hasn't slowed Rodriguez's progress. It is obvious that Rodriguez knows how to operate with the guys, without becoming one of the guys. Certainly, Rodriguez doesn't look like a mechanical engineer: pocket protectors and out-of-style glasses don't seem to be part of her wardrobe. Actually, she looks like she could be Indy Racing League driver Danica Patrick's sister. This comparison is fitting given the ride we were about to experience. Spicing up the bull . Rodriguez explained the process used to give a car a dynamic personality. ""First, we start with models generated by Computer Aided Engineering,"" she said. ""These give us starting points for (suspension) spring rates, dampers, bar thicknesses, etc. After that, everything we do is by the seat of the pants. That's why it's so important to have a feel for what's happening at the road, because you end up becoming a cook who is perfecting a recipe by trial and error. We add more of this or take away some of that. Each change is designed to wake you up and make you feel alive behind the wheel, just like eating a great meal."" AOL Autos: 2009 best looking cars . The 2010 Ford Taurus has four distinct suspension calibrations; they are mechanical recipes, if you will. There's one each for the front-wheel-drive Taurus, the all-wheel-drive Taurus, the all-wheel-drive high-performance SHO and the ultimate SHO fitted with the Performance Package. Rodriguez noted that each model has unique suspension calibrations that are based on the specific model's equipment and personality. For example, the two non-SHO Taurus models must have the same feel even though one carries the additional weight of the all-wheel-drive system. ""The Taurus needs to be comfortably engaging,"" she said. ""It can't be stiff like a (Mustang) Shelby GT500, but it also can't be too soft like a Toyota Camry. We wanted to keep most of the suppleness of the Lincoln MKS sedan, but make it more responsive."" AOL Autos: First drive of the 2010 Ford Mustang Shelby GT . The move from the regular Taurus to the SHO edition is dramatic. This is where about 10-percent more chili powder and cayenne pepper get added to the recipe. Nearly every tunable suspension component is changed between the base model and the SHO, resulting in a much more dynamic drive. The step up from the SHO to the SHO with the Performance Pack tightens everything even further (more chilies), including another 20-percent on the dampers (those would be struts and shock absorbers to non-engineers), then 9-percent stiffer rear springs, and a thicker rear anti-roll bar. These changes make the most performance-oriented SHO a more neutral handling car that drivers should find exceptionally agile and immediately responsive. Riding shotgun in the Ford Taurus SHO . Rodriguez was only too willing to take us for a ride to demonstrate what she had been talking about, ""This car is really my pride and joy. I think you're going to like it."" With that, she moved the floor-shifter into Sport mode and took off. Riding along in the passenger seat, we couldn't help but feel how effortlessly the twin-turbocharged EcoBoost engine took the full-size Taurus well above legal speeds. Unlike turbocharged cars from decades past, the SHO did not seem to exhibit any turbo lag. And the turbochargers sounded quiet (no turbo whine or unrefined popping and hissing). The EcoBoost is efficient, too, although EPA numbers aren't yet available. From where we sat, the ride was firm but not harsh, even as Crissy drove us over test roads that were intentionally bumpy and pocked. By far, the most fun was riding along on the handling course. This smooth, serpentine ribbon features undulating hills and off-camber curves. Normally, one wouldn't expect a full-size car to be at home here. The steering would be too slow and the handing ponderous. We weren't behind the wheel, but we got the impression that the Taurus SHO is no traditional full-size car. The SHO's heavy-duty six-speed gearbox felt quick and smooth from a passenger's perspective, and as Rodriguez increased engine speed, the growl came from under the hood, not the exhaust. Rodriguez confirmed that the turbochargers absorb much of the exhaust noise. The faster Rodriguez drove, the smaller the Taurus seemed to get, easily carving lines between and through the corners. The roll of the body felt well controlled from a passenger's perspective, and it never wallowed. Watching Rodriguez dial in the steering, the car felt like it responded quickly and directly. Compared to an all-wheel-drive Taurus, the SHO's unit gets unique tuning with a greater power bias to the rear wheels for a more balanced feel, and the car seemed to rotate around the corners effortlessly. We can't wait to get behind the wheel ourselves later this spring, when we'll provide a full road test. ""After doing this for 12 years,"" Rodriguez said. ""I know what a car should feel like, and I don't get questioned anymore,"" Rodriguez said. In other words, Rodriguez earned the respect of other engineers, making it completely understandable why Ford would trust her to tune the ride of this very important new car. After about 30 minutes of trashing around Ford's Dearborn proving grounds, Crissy Rodriguez aptly demonstrated that she and the team she's part of knows how to dial in the suspension of a performance car. As she pressed the Start/Stop button on the SHO's dash, Rodriguez said, ""I think I've got the best job at Ford."" We'd agree.","Ford's Cristina Rodriguez is an engineer and race car driver .

"(CNN) -- The reaction to Kanye West's hijacking of the microphone from Taylor Swift during her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards came quickly and unequivocally. Kanye West took the microphone from Taylor Swift during her speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. Celebrities and fans alike expressed their disapproval of West interrupting Swift's win for Best Female Video to tout his appreciation of nominee Beyonce. ""Taylor, I'm really happy for you,"" West said after grabbing the microphone from a clearly stunned Swift. ""I'll let you finish, but Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time! One of the best videos of all time!"" Elliott Wilson, founder and chief executive officer of Rap Radar, sat in front of members of West's entourage at the live Sunday night awards show and said the mood quickly turned from one of surprised amusement to anger.  Watch West grab the microphone from Swift » . ""At first, people weren't sure if it was kind of like a gag,"" Wilson said. ""You could feel everybody being nervous and not knowing if it was a prank or something. Then people started booing him really loud."" Wilson said he believes that West -- who he said bounded on stage from his seat in the front row near Beyonce -- intended to have his say before allowing Swift to continue but said the rapper became angered by the crowd response in a moment that wasn't captured by the MTV cameras. ""The reaction to his tantrum was so strong ... and what happened was, he gave everybody the finger,"" Wilson said. Stars taking to Twitter returned the sentiment with some harsh words for the sometimes mercurial rap star. Singer Pink tweeted, ""Kanye West is the biggest piece of [expletive] on earth. Quote me,"" and Joel Madden of the band Good Charlotte tweeted, ""All i'm saying is Taylor Swift is a young chic and you just walk up and grab the mic."" Celebrity blogger Perez Hilton said via Twitter that ""Taylor Swift deserved that award, damnit. It is what THE PEOPLE voted! My heart broke for her, she looked so sad at the end of that moment."" Singer Katy Perry weighed in with ""F--- u Kanye. It's like you stepped on a kitten."" VMA nominee Kelly Clarkson took to her blog to publish an open letter to West. ""What happened to you as a child?? Did you not get hugged enough??"" she asked. On Monday, ""Taylor Swift,"" ""VMAs,"" ""Kanye's"" and ""Beyonce"" were top trending topics on Twitter.  Watch Swift respond to what happened » . Wilson, a noted hip-hop journalist, said there was a great deal of tension inside the event Sunday night before West and his girlfriend, model Amber Rose, left the show. ""It was almost like wrestling, when the good guy turns bad and the crowd turns on him,"" Wilson said. ""Every time his name was mentioned, people booed."" Wilson said he believes that alcohol may have played a part in West's actions, given that the rapper appeared both on the red carpet and inside the arena with a bottle of cognac. Wilson added that West is well known for such behavior. He appeared uninvited onstage at the 2006 MTV Europe Music Awards, walked out of the 2004 American Music Awards after losing in the Best New Artist category and reportedly threw a backstage tantrum at the 2007 VMAs because he did not perform on the main stage. ""I think Kanye came in to be the bad boy, but he obviously had an emotional spaz moment because he is cool"" with Beyonce and her husband, Jay-Z, Wilson said. ""I think the alcohol blurred his judgment."" Wilson said attendees at the awards show were allowed to have drinks at their seats. Emil Wilbekin, managing editor of Essence.com, said West may have gone too far with his antics this time. ""I think that it was not Kanye's place to speak for Beyonce or to ruin Taylor Swift's moment,"" Wilbekin said. ""It's OK for Kanye to rattle off about himself, but I think he crossed the line when he decided to speak for other people."" Though West is known for having a healthy ego, Wilbekin said, his actions may be damaging the very legacy the rapper claims to want to leave. ""He's talked about wanting to be Elvis; he's talked about wanting to be the new king of pop,"" Wilbekin said. ""It's almost like he's overshadowing himself by getting in his own way with his mouth."" West apologized to Swift via his blog. As for Swift, the young singer gave her acceptance speech after Beyonce graciously invited her onstage during her win for Video of the Year. West's disruption wasn't the only one the evening offered, Wilson said. During a performance by Jay-Z and Alicia Keys, rapper Lil Mama rushed the stage. Wilson said that from his vantage point in the audience, the female rapper, who also serves as a judge on MTV's ""America's Best Dance Crew,"" was neither expected nor wanted as part of the performance. iReport: Is civility dead? The stars' behavior might have long-lasting consequences, Wilson added. ""I wouldn't be surprised if MTV banned alcohol [at the event] next year,"" he said.","Kanye West interrupted Taylor Swift's VMA acceptance speech .

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams has handed a three-year suspended ban from the U.S. Open after her verbal tirade at a lineswoman at this year's event. The incident occurred during her semifinal defeat to Kim Clijsters when Williams was called for a foot fault to give the Belgian mum match point and her profanity-laced tirade resulted in a penalty point that ended the match. The punishments handed down by the International Tennis Federation's Grand Slam committee could result in a U.S. Open suspension if Williams commits another major violation in any Grand Slam event in 2010 or 2011. Williams was fined a record $175,000 with the amount to be reduced to $82,500 if she stays on good behavior over two seasons. The fine amount included $10,000 Williams paid the U.S. Tennis Association in September after the incident, the maximum fine the group had the power to impose. The biggest prior fine imposed by the committee came when American Jeff Tarango was fined just under $50,000. Williams initially declined to issue an apology to the line-judge but subsequently issued a contrite statement in which she said: ""I need to make it clear to all young people that I handled myself inappropriately on this occasion. ""It's not the way to act -- win or lose, good call or bad call in any sport, in any manner."" Williams was trailing Clijsters 4-6, 5-6 and serving at 15-30 when the baseline judge called a foot-fault on a second serve. She walked over to the official and waved her racket angrily as she unleashed her tirade at the official, who immediately reported what had been said to the umpire. Having earlier warned Williams for racket abuse, the official called for tournament referee Brian Earley and a penalty point was imposed which enabled Clijsters to claim the match. Replays indicated that the line judge may have got the foot fault call wrong.","Serena Williams is handed a three-year suspended ban from the U.S. Open .

"MOUNT KENYA, Kenya (CNN) -- For as long as anyone cares to remember, the pastoralists of Kenya's Rift Valley have fled with their herds to the fertile slopes of Mount Kenya when times are tough. Hundreds of dead cattle litter the slopes of Mount Kenya, fatally weakened by long treks to the region. When the rains failed this year they set off once again in search of water and pasture -- but they found only despair. ""I could have stayed home, or I could have come here, but it is all the same. All that you find is death,"" said Peraguan Lesagut, an aging pastoralist who came five months ago with his herd. After years of persistent drought Lesagut left his two wives and 16 children and drove 200 cattle to the foothills of Mount Kenya -- Africa's second highest summit. Now, only 40 are left; the rest succumbing to cold, disease and exposure. Across the folds of this mountain everyone has the same story. Hundreds of dead cattle dot the forests, young herdsmen try to coax ailing calves onto their feet, knowing that if they don't get up, they will die. ""I am hopeless because I have seen almost all of my animals die,"" Lesagut said. ""If the rains are delayed for even another week two, then I will lose everything."" Millions of Kenyans are facing the same stark reality. The World Food Program (WFP) says that, together with the Kenyan government, they will need to feed 3.8 million people across the country. Successive years of failed crops, drought and erratic rains caused by climate change have all had an impact. Somalia, Ethiopia and Djibouti all face similar crises. Despite this, the U.N. agency says that its emergency programs are facing massive shortfalls. ""We are facing a really difficult situation. We realize that the world economic crisis has affected the amount that countries can give to us,"" says WFP spokesperson Gabrielle Menezes, ""But at the same time we are seeing an awful situation in Kenya. If we don't start feeding people now, things are only going to get worse."" For many Kenyan farmers, the situation is already bad enough. Eunice Wairimu has seen four successive crops fail. This is harvest time in Kenya but her corn plants barely reach her knees and she will have to use her meager harvest as animal feed. ""I don't even like to go to my farm because I become very upset,"" she said. ""There is nothing for me to get there for my family."" Wairimu used to sell her surplus, but now she depends on food rations. She accepts them grudgingly. ""According to our tribal culture, we aren't used to being given food. We have always been willing to work hard. If it is the will of God to bring rain, he will bring rain. But he also brings drought.""","Millions of rural Kenyans at risk of starvation because of drought, crop failure .

"(CNN)  -- Roger Federer has been hit with a $1,500 fine for swearing at the umpire during his shock U.S. Open final defeat to Juan Martin Del Potro. Federer argues with umpire Jake Garner during his five-set defeat to Del Potro. The world number one became embroiled in an argument with Jake Garner at the end of the second set after complaining Del Potro was taking too long to decide whether or not to make challenges. The Argentine successfully overturned an ""out"" call shortly before Federer's outburst, a point that led to him breaking serve and eventually taking the set. During the exchange Federer was picked up on microphones telling Garner: ""Don't tell me when to be quiet, okay? When I want to talk, I'll talk."" Del Potro went on to claim his first grand slam, ending Federer's five-year unbeaten run at Flushing Meadows and denying the Swiss maestro a 16th grand slam title. Federer's fine pales in comparison to the one meted out to Serena Williams, who was docked $10,000 for an altercation with a line judge at the climax of her semifinal with eventual winner Kim Clijsters. Williams reacted angrily after being called for a foot fault, and unleashed a torrent of abuse at the official, who reported the exchange to umpire Louise Engzell. The resulting penalty point for a code violation handed the match to Clijsters. Williams later apologized for the incident. She was also fined $500 for racket abuse in the same encounter. Over $31,000 in fines were handed out in the final grand slam of the season with Daniel Nestor, from Canada, forced to pay $5,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct towards a fan he confronted. Vera Zvonareva of Russia and Austria's Daniel Koellerer were also fined $1,500 for audible obscenities.

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- United Nations-backed nuclear inspectors on Sunday visited a newly disclosed Iranian nuclear facility near the city of Qom, Iranian media has reported. ""IAEA inspectors today visited the... nuclear installation,"" the semi-official Mehr news agency said, referring to International Atomic Energy Agency staff. ""The IAEA inspectors arrived Saturday night and are scheduled to inspect the... site several times. The inspectors will leave Tehran Tuesday."" Tehran sent shock waves through the international community in September by revealing the existence of the previously secret nuclear enrichment facility near Qom. The IAEA announced Saturday its inspectors were leaving for the much-anticipated inspection. The agency declined to give more details on Sunday. ""It is our policy not to comment on the itinerary of our inspectors,"" a spokesman for the U.N. nuclear watchdog told CNN. The inspectors will visit the installation to make sure it is being used for peaceful purposes, said Ali Akbar Salehi, the head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency. The inspection comes after Iran said Friday that it needs more time to decide whether to sign onto a deal that could help end the international showdown over its nuclear activities. That proposal calls for low-enriched uranium produced in Iran to be sent abroad for further enrichment and then returned for use in medical research and treatment. Tehran is studying the draft proposal and will have an answer next week, Iranian diplomat Ali Asghar Soltanieh said on state-run Press TV. Iran informed IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei that it is ""considering the proposal in depth and in a favorable light, but it needs until the middle of next week to provide a response,"" according to an IAEA statement. Delegations from Iran, France, Russia, the United States and the IAEA met in Vienna this week to work out details of the tentative deal reached in early October. France, Russia and the United States have indicated their approval of the arrangement. ""The Director General hopes that Iran's response will equally be positive, since approval of this agreement will signal a new era of cooperation,"" the IAEA statement said. After the current inspection, but before the end of the month, Iranian officials are expected to meet with the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- plus Germany to further discuss Tehran's nuclear program. Iran's leaders maintain that their nation's nuclear program is intended solely for peaceful purposes, but many in the West believe Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities. Low-enriched nuclear fuel can be further enriched into weapons-grade material. CNN's Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","The IAEA announced Saturday its inspectors were leaving for the inspection .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Harry Patch -- the last surviving British soldier from World War I -- died Saturday at the age of 111, Britain's Ministry of Defence said. Harry Patch, pictured here on November 11, 2008, at an Armistice Day commemoration ceremony in London. Patch died peacefully at his care home in the southwestern English city of Wells, the ministry announced. His death came a week after fellow British World War I veteran Henry Allingham died at the age of 113. Patch was the last surviving soldier to have witnessed the horrors of trench warfare in the first World War . He fought and was seriously wounded in Ypres, Belgium, in 1917 at the Battle of Passchendaele, in which 70,000 of his fellow soldiers died -- including three of his close friends. Born in 1898, Patch became a plumber before being conscripted to the army in 1916. After training, Patch was recruited to The Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry as a Lewis gunner assistant. The unit was rushed to the front line trenches of Ypres, where soldiers were urgently needed to replace those who were wounded and dying by the thousand. He fought in the trenches between June and September of 1917 and was involved in some of the fiercest fighting of the war. In late September he was wounded when a light shell exploded above his head, bringing an end to his military service. He received battlefield treatment without anesthetic. After the war, Harry returned to his work as a plumber and later became a sanitary engineer. He married Ada Billington, a young girl he met while convalescing after the battle. They married in 1919 and had two sons. In World War II, Patch joined the Auxiliary Fire Service and helped tackle the fires caused by heavy German raids on the English cities of Bath and Bristol. At one point, he was sent to organize sanitary arrangements for soldiers at a camp near Yeovil, where he became friendly with some of the men. Patch remembered the shock of finding the camp deserted, with coffee still hot and meals half-eaten, on the morning that the soldiers had gone off to France, the Ministry of Defence said. His wife, Ada, died in 1976, and their two sons also later died. Patch remarried in 1980, but he became a widower for the second time four years later. Patch didn't speak about the war until he turned 100, the Ministry of Defence said. ""He tried to suppress the memories and to live as normal a life as possible; the culture of his time said that he was fortunate to have survived and that he should get on with his life,"" a Ministry of Defence biography says. ""That suited Harry; he could 'forget' his demons, the memories of what happened to him and to his close friends."" In 1998, a television producer with an interest in the war talked to Patch, who then made the decision to speak of his memories, the Ministry of Defence said. He took part in a documentary on the war and began gradually to open up. It wasn't long before Patch became a spokesman for his generation, speaking about the horrors of the war as well as his own emotions and reactions, the Ministry of Defence said. ""In speaking about his experiences, Harry began at last to come to terms with his war, and was at peace with himself and his memories,"" the Defence Ministry said. ""His thoughts then turned to reconciliation, to the long-term effects of suffering and coming to terms with that suffering."" Patch returned to Belgium in 2002, something he had said he would never do, and laid a wreath to his battalion, the Defence Ministry said. Two years later, he met and shook hands with a German artilleryman from the Western Front, Charles Kuentz. Patch later laid a wreath at Langemark Cemetery for the German war dead. In his last years, Patch was honored at Buckingham Palace and the prime minister's residence at 10 Downing Street. On his 101st birthday France awarded him the Knighthood of the Legion of Honor, and this year President Nicolas Sarkozy upgraded that to the rank of officer. Last year, King Albert II of Belgium made Patch a Knight of the Order of Leopold. ""Harry was delighted to receive these awards and wore the medals with great pride, but he always made it clear that he wore these medals as a representative of the selfless generation he had come to represent,"" the Ministry of Defence said. Patch wrote a book detailing his life in 2007, called ""The Last Fighting Tommy."" The name referred to the slang term for British privates. ""While the country may remember Harry as a soldier, we will remember him as a dear friend,"" said Jim Ross, a close friend. ""He was a man of peace who used his great age and fame as the last survivor of the trenches to communicate two simple messages: Remember with gratitude and respect those who served on all sides, (and) settle disputes by discussion, not war."" Gen. Richard Dannatt, the chief of the general staff, issued a statement expressing his sadness about Patch's death. ""Self-effacing about his experiences in the trenches he was no less effective in describing the horror they represented when invited to speak to schoolchildren about the realities of war."" Dannatt said. ""He was the last of a generation that in youth was steadfast in its duty in the face of cruel sacrifice and we give thanks for his life -- as well as those of his comrades -- for upholding the same values and freedom that we continue to cherish and fight for today.""","Harry Patch, dead at 111, was last British survivor of World War One trench warfare .

"(CNN) -- A union representing thousands of transit workers went on strike early Tuesday in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, shutting down buses, subways and trolleys that carry almost a million people daily. Transport Workers Union leaders walked out of contract talks just before midnight, saying they couldn't accept an offer from the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority because of a shortfall in their pension fund and disagreements on some work rule issues. Joe Casey, general manager of the transit authority, said the offer presented to workers was competitive. Are you stranded by the strike? Share your story .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Broadening the number of health care professionals who can administer vaccine, New York Gov. David Paterson issued a sweeping executive order Thursday officially declaring a state of emergency due to the increase in H1N1 cases, including 75 H1N1-related deaths in New York state. The announcement, which comes on the heels of President Obama's declaration of H1N1 flu as a national emergency, expands the categories of health care professionals who can give the vaccine to include dentists, pharmacists, podiatrists, midwives and emergency medical technicians, the executive order said. At a news conference Thursday afternoon, Paterson stressed that his order is not intended to incite panic but rather allocates the necessary resources to effectively combat H1N1 flu, also known as swine flu. ""If an enormous number of flu vaccines came into the state because of an epidemic and an emergency and we need to administer them as widely as possible, we have expanded the health care personnel who would be deemed to have the authority to administer the flu vaccine,"" Paterson told reporters. Under current state law, some health care professionals are prohibited from delivering the vaccine because of limits on their professional duties. The governor's order waives any law that would prevent these people from giving vaccinations, according to Claire Pospisil from the New York state department of health. ""It's called an emergency declaration, but what it does is that it provides New York the capability that once vaccine supplies become more available, it allows (health departments) to quickly vaccinate as many people as possible,"" Pospisil said. Dr. Mark Feldman, a retired dentist who serves as executive director of the New York State Dental Association, which represents 75 percent of the dentists in the state, said he would be more than willing to help administer the vaccine. ""If there is a shortage and they need more hands, I can do my part,"" Feldman said. Health care professionals named in the executive order may not administer the vaccine at their individual practices. Rather, they must do so at a New York state health department distribution center. Feldman thinks it would be wiser to allow these health care professionals to distribute the vaccine at their private practices. ""If there is a severe outbreak, to go to a mass distribution center, you risk being exposed,"" Feldman said. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg issued a statement Thursday supporting Paterson's order. It will ""let a larger number of health care workers administer vaccines, and strengthen our health department's ability to track the use of vaccine supplies,"" the statement read. About 800,000 people in New York City became infected with the disease during the first wave of the virus last spring, according to the New York City Department of Health . The New York health department will provide training for administering the vaccinations, though the exact amount of training required is yet to be determined, according to Tom Dunn of the New York state education department, which issues vaccine licenses.","Gov.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Former President Carter warned members of Congress on Tuesday that America's failure to achieve energy independence is threatening the country's national security, undermining its long-term potential for economic growth and contributing to global warming. Former President Carter said Tuesday that the United States must end its energy-based vulnerability. ""Collectively, nothing could be more important than this question of energy,"" Carter said during a rare presidential appearance before a congressional committee. ""I would guess that our entire status as a leading nation in the world will depend on the role that we play in energy and environment in the future."" Carter, who in 1977 famously declared the fight for energy independence to be ""the moral equivalent of war,"" told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that reaching that goal is crucial to ending the country's ""vulnerability to possible pressures and blackmail."" Right now, he noted, ""whether we admit it or not, we are very careful not to aggravate our major oil suppliers.""  Watch Carter talk about energy and security » . He also asserted that more jobs will be gained than lost by transitioning the country away from fossil fuels and toward cleaner, renewable energy sources. Carter's testimony came as Congress continues its consideration of broad-reaching energy legislation with the potential to dramatically tighten emissions controls while reshaping America's environmental standards. Among other things, the American Clean Energy and Security Act would create a controversial ""cap-and-trade"" system establishing steadily declining limits on greenhouse gas emissions over the next four decades. Under the bill, polluters would be able to buy and sell emissions credits while utilities would be required to generate an increasing amount of power from renewable sources. Congressional attention to the issue is being driven by President Obama, who, like Carter, has placed energy near the top of his domestic agenda. Carter suggested that energy reform advocates craft an omnibus proposal that could be considered collectively by Congress in order to minimize ""adverse influence of special interest groups"" opposed to any major changes. Powerful entrenched interests ultimately helped derail his administration's energy agenda, he said. Carter noted that his administration nevertheless succeeded in reducing net oil imports by 50 percent, from 8.6 to 4.3 million barrels per day. But after ""a long period of energy complacency,"" he said, daily imports to the United States are now almost 13 million barrels. America consumes 2.5 times more oil than China and 7.5 times more than India, he noted. On a per capita basis, the United States consumes 12 times more oil than China and 28 times more than India. ""Although our rich nation can afford these daily purchases, there is little doubt that, in general terms, we are constrained not to alienate our major oil suppliers, which puts a restraint on our nation's foreign policy,"" Carter said. The former president reminded committee members that, as part of his drive for renewable energy, he had ordered 32 solar panels to be placed on the roof of the White House in 1979. But the panels were removed ""almost instantaneously after [Ronald Reagan] moved into the White House, with assurances to the American people that such drastic action would no longer be necessary."" Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, opened the hearing by noting that the price of a barrel of oil has fallen $90 below the record high hit in summer 2008. Unfortunately, Kerry added, the ""political will to take decisive action has dissipated"" as each past energy crisis has subsided. Carter ""had the courage to tell the truth to Americans [and] set America on the right path in the 1970s,"" Kerry said. ""Regrettably, the ensuing years saw those efforts unfunded [and] stripped away."" Richard Nixon was the first president to set a goal of energy independence, Kerry noted. Nixon called for that goal to be reached by 1980.","""Our entire status as a leading nation"" will depend on energy role, ex-president says .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Federal investigators trying to determine why a Delta Air Lines jet landed on a taxiway instead of the runway in Atlanta on Monday morning say the runway was illuminated, but that approach lights and a ground-based instrument that helps pilots line up with the runway were off. The pilots of the plane that landed at the Atlanta airport have been relieved from flying duties pending probes. The incident happened at Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the world's busiest. But it occurred shortly before dawn, when airport operations are slow. Delta Flight 60, from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was cleared to land on a main runway around 6:05 a.m., but it landed instead on nearby Taxiway M, which runs parallel to the runway, said FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen. The departure taxiway, which can be filled with aircraft during peak hours, was empty at the time, and the plane landed safely, officials said. No one was injured, and there was no damage to the taxiway. The Boeing 767 aircraft had 182 passengers and a crew of 11. The FAA, the National Transportation Safety Board and Delta Air Lines are investigating. The pilots of the aircraft were placed on nonflight status, Delta said. The NTSB on Wednesday confirmed that a ""check pilot"" on the flight was sick, and the crew had declared a medical emergency. It was not clear what, if any, role that played in the mishap. Sources familiar with the incident say that Flight 60 originally was scheduled to land on Runway 27L (left), the active runway at that time, but was ""sidestepped"" to Runway 27R (right). Pilots commonly ask to be ""sidestepped"" to Runway 27R -- and air traffic controllers commonly offer 27R -- because it is closer to the terminal and pilots can shave minutes from a trip. In this case, it is not clear whether the pilot made the request, or the air traffic controllers made the offer. Nor is it clear why the change was made -- whether to shave time from the flight, or because of the medical emergency on the aircraft or  some other reason. But after being given permission to land on Runway 27R, the plane went too far to the right, landing on Taxiway M. The runway was marked with yellow lights, while the taxiway was marked with blue lights, one person familiar with the incident said. The NTSB said the runway lights on 27R were illuminated, but a ""localizer"" and approach lights for the runway were off. Officials said the weather at the airport was clear, and the NTSB said the wind was calm at 10 mph. The sky was dark, with twilight still more than an hour away. The NTSB said a ""check airman"" was in the cockpit with the captain and first officer during the flight, but became ill and moved to the cabin for the remainder of the flight. Check airman are company pilots who watch over crew members during significant flights, such as when a first officer becomes a captain, when a pilot is making a maiden international flight, or over mountainous terrain for the first time. The NTSB said it is uncertain why the check airman was on the Delta flight. Delta spokesman Anthony Black said the airline is cooperating with the FAA and the NTSB and conducting its own investigation. The pilots of the flight have been relieved from active flying, he said. The incident came just two weeks after the FAA announced that serious runway incursions were down 50 percent this year. Close calls in 2007 at some of the busiest U.S. airports prompted the FAA to take action to reduce the risk of runway incursions and wrong runway departures. There were 24 serious runway incursions that year, eight of them involving commercial carriers.","Delta Flight 60 from Brazil landed on taxiway instead of runway in Atlanta, Georgia .

"Although you may think that bottled water is a safer option than tap, two new reports show that the store-bought stuff is actually less regulated than the water you get out of your faucet for free. What's in your water? You may be hard pressed to find out, reports the Environmental Working Group. The Food and Drug Administration has little authority to regulate bottled brands, according to a U.S. Congressional report released recently. While municipal water utilities are required to provide public reports of test results, bottled-water makers are not. (On the other hand, well water, which is found in many rural areas, isn't regulated as water provided by towns and cities is.) So although you may fork over a pretty penny for bottled water, that doesn't mean it's any better than what's coming out of your faucet. In fact, it could be worse and you'd never know it. The new research is backed by a second report from the Environmental Working Group. The nonprofit advocacy organization surveyed the labels and Web sites of nearly 200 popular bottled-water brands and found that less than 2 percent disclosed three important facts that can affect safety: the water's source, purification methods, and chemical pollutants in each bottle. (See the full report on bottled water at EWG's Web site.) ""We're really pushing for a consumer's right to know what's in their water,"" says Nneka Leiba, an environmental health researcher at the EWG. ""This isn't a doomsday scenario. It isn't that the claims are false; it's just that they are misleading."" Reaching for the most popular bottled brands isn't necessarily a solution. In fact, the EWG report found that some of the best-known brands -- for example Whole Foods and San Pellegrino -- are the least likely to report where the water comes from and what it contains. Health.com: Plastic recycling gets easier . ""This probably has to do with the fact that they're imported, so the regulations are different,"" says Leiba. ""Some of the brands you think wouldn't be as transparent, like Walgreens or Sam's Club, scored higher than many of the popular brands."" So what's a safety-conscious shopper to do? In recent years, some reports have suggested that tap water could be contaminated by trace amounts of pharmaceuticals or other substances. Health.com: Why caffeine and sugar are poor substitutes for sleep . Leiba says that activated carbon water filters -- like Brita pitchers or faucet attachments -- are a safe and affordable option for filtering tap water. If families can afford it, she recommends a reverse osmosis filter, which will eliminate all impurities. These reports come as food safety concerns seem to be at an all-time high. Lately, recalls of spinach, sprouts, peanut butter, and, most recently, cookie dough have made many consumers start to question the safety of the items they find on grocery-store shelves. Unlike tap water suppliers, bottled water companies don't have to have their water tested by a certified laboratory, and they aren't required to notify customers within 24 hours if they find elevated levels of contaminants. The FDA does require bottled water companies to test for contaminants and other problems, says Joshua Sharfstein, M.D., the agency's principal deputy commissioner. Health.com: Could your rug make you sick? If the companies fail, however, the public doesn't get to see the actual test results. ""There's clearly a difference in disclosure between municipal water and bottled water, but the FDA's laws focus on safety of food more than on disclosure of information,"" says Sharfstein. ""It's not a question of whether the FDA can do more; it's whether the government can do more through the food safety bill."" Only changes in the current regulations would make it mandatory for manufacturers to make those kinds of records public, he says. Those regulations may change with the Food Safety Enhancement Act. Health.com: Drink this tea to lose that belly .

"(CNN) -- An agreement could be reached before week's end between Washington University students and an Illinois nightclub that allegedly barred six African-American students while admitting nearly 200 of their white classmates. Fernando Cutz, senior class president at the university in Missouri, said the aggrieved students have been in contact with lawyers representing Original Mother's, a bar in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood. The two sides expect a resolution to their dispute as early as Wednesday, Cutz said. He did not, however, say what the students were demanding or why he was optimistic that a deal could be struck. The students complained to state and federal agencies after six African-American members from their senior class trip celebration were denied admission to the club on October 17. Bar personnel cited dress code violations -- specifically baggy jeans -- in barring the African-American students, Cutz said. A white student and a black student then exchanged jeans to see what would happen. The white student was admitted, while his classmate still was kept outside, Cutz said. Calls from CNN to the nightclub were not immediately returned. The bar told the Chicago Tribune newspaper that it was investigating. The celebration at Original Mother's was to top off a two-day senior class trip to Chicago, Cutz said. The party had been arranged with the bar in advance by the student class board, which includes two of the African-American students who were later denied entry, Cutz said. He said he was already inside the bar with some 200 other students, none of whom are African-American, when the first group of African-American classmates arrived. Cutz said he quickly learned that the manager of the bar had denied the six students entry, and he said the manager told the students their baggy pants violated the bar's dress code. Cutz, who is white, said he confronted the manager. ""These six [students] were better dressed than I was,"" Cutz told CNN. He told the students to ""go back to the hotel and change."" But the manager of the bar stepped in to say that he had made his decision and that the six men could not return to the bar even if they changed clothes, Cutz said. The students became ""more agitated"" and ""set up an experiment,"" Cutz said. Class Treasurer Regis Murayi, who is black, exchanged jeans with a white student, Jordan Roberts, who -- being 3 inches shorter than Murayi -- looked ""substantially baggy."" Roberts approached the same manager who had turned away the African-American students, paid the entry fee and was allowed in, Cutz said. CNN's Susan Candiotti also contributed to this report.","Group: Bar kept African-American students out, let white classmates in .

"(CNN) -- Five people were detained off Somalia's coast Wednesday after pirates mistook a French ship involved in an anti-piracy operation for a commercial vessel, the French Defense Ministry said. A German-flagged warship taking part in the EU's anti-piracy mission is pictured in this April 2009 file photo. There were no injuries as a result of the attack on the BCR Somme, the ministry said. The pirates opened fire at midnight local time, about 250 nautical miles (463 kilometers) off Somalia's coast, officials added. An hour after the attack, the French command and supply ship chased down one of the pirates' skiffs, and detained five suspected pirates, it said. A second skiff involved in the attack got away. The BCR Somme was carrying supplies off Somalia's coast to forces involved in the European anti-piracy operation, called ""Atalante,"" the ministry said. Europe and other Western powers have stepped up their maritime patrols off Somalia's coast following a spate of pirate attacks over the past year. Somalia's transitional government, which has a tenuous grip on power, has been unable to stop the pirates, many of whom are based in Somalia's port cities. Those who have tracked pirate activity say it started in the 1980s in Somalia, when the pirates claimed they were aiming to stop the rampant illegal fishing and dumping that continues to this day off the Somali coast. Piracy accelerated after the fall of the Somali government in the early 1990s and began to flourish after shipping companies started paying ransoms. Those payments started out being in the tens of thousands of dollars and have since climbed into the millions. Some experts say companies are simply making the problem worse by paying the pirates.","Pirates fire on French ship involved in anti-piracy operation off Somali coast .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Former teen idol Leif Garrett posted a $10,000 bond Wednesday after spending two days in a jail on a drug charge, a Los Angeles County sheriff's spokesman said. Garrett, 48, was arrested Monday at a downtown Los Angeles train station after police found heroin in his shoe, spokesman Steve Whitmore said. He was 16 when he scored his first pop chart hit,  ""Surfin' USA,"" in 1977. It was followed by a four-year run of songs that kept young girls swooning and teens dancing. When deputies approached Garrett Monday morning at the Metrolink station, he was ""acting in a pronounced way, shaking and sweating,"" Whitmore said. Garrett told them he was ""nervous around law enforcement because of other meetings with them in the past,"" he said. The singer did jail time four years ago after he was arrested with heroin while he stood on a subway platform at another Los Angeles transit station. This time, Garrett told the officers that he had no drugs and he agreed to let them search him, Whitmore said. As they searched, Garrett told them he did have a little heroin in his shoe. ""That was found and it was black tar heroin,"" Whitmore said. Garrett was taken to the East Los Angeles sheriff's station, where he was booked and held on bond. His court date is February 24, Whitmore said. CNN's Michelle Wright and Alan Duke contributed to this report.","L.A. County authorities: Leif Garrett posts $10,000 bond after two days in a jail .

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- The Orleans Parish district attorney said he plans to look into deaths at a New Orleans hospital in the days following Hurricane Katrina, but stopped short of calling it an investigation. Staff at Memorial were accused of hastening four patients' deaths in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. ""My office has not reopened an investigation into the deaths at Memorial hospital"" after Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in 2005, Leon Cannizzaro said in a statement released Friday. ""As district attorney, I have a legal obligation to evaluate statements regarding possible criminal activity in this jurisdiction,"" the statement said. ""I am making that kind of evaluation, but that does not constitute an investigation by this office."" The New Orleans Times-Picayune reported in a story Saturday that Cannizzaro will interview New Orleans coroner Frank Minyard and possibly other pathologists on the coroner's staff regarding the deaths of Memorial Medical Center patients. But the newspaper quoted Cannizzaro as saying an investigation would involve convening a grand jury and bringing in witnesses to testify, and he does not at this time have plans to do that. After speaking with the coroner, the district attorney said he would decide whether a more in-depth investigation is necessary. Cannizzaro's spokesman, Christopher Bowman, said Monday the DA's office had no further comment beyond the Friday statement. According to the Times-Picayune, Cannizzaro's conversation with Minyard was prompted by an article in The New York Times last month that quoted two doctors as saying that they gave Memorial patients morphine and other drugs in the days after the hurricane struck, knowing they would die. Cannizzaro told the newspaper he would be ""remiss in his responsibilities"" if he did not talk to Minyard about information in the article. ""That doesn't mean I am opening an investigation,"" he said. Katrina roared ashore near the Mississippi-Louisiana state line on August 29, 2005, rupturing three of New Orleans' protective levees and putting about three-quarters of the city under water. Then-Louisiana Attorney General Charles Foti Jr. launched an investigation after officials from Lifecare, an acute-care facility operating on the seventh floor of Memorial, reported allegations that several seriously ill, mostly elderly patients had been euthanized by medical staff at Memorial as the floodwater rose around the hospital and conditions inside deteriorated. In 2006, Foti ordered the arrest of Dr. Anna Pou and two nurses, Lori Budo and Cheri Landry, on preliminary charges of second-degree murder in the deaths of four patients. Former Orleans Parish District Attorney Eddie Jordan, who under Louisiana law was responsible for prosecuting crimes, gave Budo and Landry immunity in exchange for their testimony. In July 2007, the grand jury refused to indict Pou. Foti said his investigation revealed that the four patients -- ages 63, 68, 91 and 93 -- were given a ""lethal cocktail"" of morphine and midazolam hydrochloride, both central nervous system depressants. Pou, Landry and Budo all denied the charges, and their attorneys said they acted heroically, staying to treat patients rather than evacuate. In an interview with Newsweek magazine in 2007, Pou admitted giving the patients drugs. ""If in doing so it hastened their deaths, then that's what happened,"" she said. ""But this was not, 'I'm going to go to the seventh floor and murder some people.' We're here to help patients."" The grand jury never heard testimony from five specialists who advised Foti that the patients were deliberately killed with overdoses of drugs after Katrina struck. All five were brought in by Foti's office to analyze the deaths, and concluded the patients were homicide victims. After the grand jury refused to indict Pou, Jordan called the case closed and said he would no longer pursue it. If Cannizzaro does decide an in-depth investigation is warranted, it could affect the outcome of a lawsuit in which CNN and The Times-Picayune are seeking the release of Foti's investigative file into the deaths. CNN was the first to report the allegations of euthanasia, six weeks after the hurricane. The case went to the Louisiana Supreme Court, which in July sent it back to the trial court to rule on whether criminal litigation in the case is reasonably anticipated, according to Lori Mince, the New Orleans attorney representing the media organizations. A reopened investigation could lead the court to rule that criminal charges may be forthcoming. Hospital workers identified only as John and Jane Doe had sued to block the public release of the file, claiming the records are covered by grand jury secrecy rules, that they should have been considered confidential informants and that releasing the documents would violate their privacy.","Post-Katrina euthanasia was alleged at Memorial Hospital .

"(CNN)  -- An Illinois woman and her boyfriend, already charged with aiding in the abduction of the woman's 6-year-old grandson, face new charges of tampering with a witness in the case, officials said Tuesday. Ricky Chekevdia, 6, allegedly was hidden with his mother in a secret room in his grandmother's house. Diane Dobbs and Robert Sandefur, both 51, are in jail pending the filing of formal charges in the case, said Beth Sandusky, victim services coordinator for the state attorney's office in Franklin County, Illinois. The two were charged previously with aiding and abetting child abduction, a felony, according to Sandusky and court records. They were released from jail on bond Monday, but were back in custody within hours, according to ABC News and CNN affiliate WSIL. Last week, authorities found Ricky Chekevdia, Dobbs' grandson, at her home. The boy was hiding along with his mother, Shannon Wilfong, in a secret room built to hide them -- an area about 5 feet by 12 feet, with a 4-foot ceiling, according to WSIL. Police say the boy had been hidden for nearly two years. Wilfong, 30, is jailed on felony child abduction charges and made her first court appearance Tuesday, Sandusky said. ""We let him out of the car and he ran around like he'd never seen the outdoors,"" Master Sgt. Stan Diggs with the Illinois State Police told WSIL. ""It was actually very sad."" In an interview on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" on Monday, before she was arrested, Dobbs disputed the accusation that Ricky was hidden in the small room, saying that in two years he spent ""maybe five minutes"" there. ""My grandson had the run of the house,"" she said. ""When we were outside, we would go fishing, we would do weenie roasts. We've done fireworks on the Fourth of July. He's helped me plant my flower garden in the back."" She said she would not plead guilty to the charges. ""We were on our own and we had to do what we had to do and that was make sure our grandson was safe,"" Dobbs said. Sandusky would not comment on the pending charges against Dobbs and Sandefur or identify the witness. However, a woman told WSIL she called police after Dobbs and Sandefur came onto her property and threatened her son's life. Diggs told WSIL that Ricky is ""in very good spirits for someone who's been isolated in that house. ... He's a very, very social, very polite, very talkative little boy."" Wilfong and Ricky's father, Michael Chekevdia, had battled over custody since Ricky was born in 2002, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. They initially had joint custody, Chekevdia told the newspaper, but Wilfong would often fail to bring the boy for weekends or scheduled meetings, then in 2007 failed to show up for visitation hearings. A judge granted Chekevdia temporary custody, but by then Wilfong and the boy had disappeared. They were reported missing in November, and in December, prosecutors charged Wilfong with felony child abduction. Wilfong and Dobbs had accused Chekevdia of sexually abusing the boy, but authorities have said those allegations are unfounded, the Post-Dispatch said. Leaving court Tuesday, a tearful Wilfong denied any wrongdoing to reporters, and accused Chekevdia of making lewd comments about the child. She added that the boy feared returning to his father. But Chekevdia told WSIL that Wilfong and her family are ""accusing me unjustly."" ""I was the best father I could be given the time that I had with him,"" he said. Ricky was taken into Illinois Department of Children and Family Services custody, and is staying with his father's family under child welfare supervision, WSIL said. The department declined comment. Chekevdia told the station he got to see his son smile for the first time at a Labor Day parade. ""It was just a wonderful feeling to see a little boy that's been in that situation for so long enjoy himself,"" he said.","NEW: Boy's parents had battled over his custody since his birth in 2002 .

"(CNN) -- Rick Lyke was diagnosed with prostate cancer when he was 47. His response was to set up ""Pints for Prostates,"" an organization that uses the universal language of beer to reach men with its message about the importance of prostate cancer screening. In 2008, at the insistence of a colleague with prostate cancer, Lyke, from Charlotte, North Carolina, had himself tested for illness, even though he had no health problems. His doctor was initially reluctant to have him tested, as men under the age of 50 aren't considered to a high-risk group for prostate cancer, but tests came back positive and Lyke needed surgery to remove the cancer. His surgeon said that if Lyke had waited until he was 50 to be screened, he would probably have only lived another two or three years. ""I'm doing great now,"" Lyke told CNN. ""I have to get tested every six months for the next 15 years, but I really feel like I dodged a bullet."" Prostate cancer affects one in six men American men, with 27,000 Americans expected to die from the disease this year. The American Cancer Society believes health care professionals should discuss the potential benefits and limitations of prostate cancer early detection testing with men before any testing begins. It says that should include an offer for yearly testing with the prostate-specific antigen blood test and digital rectal exam, beginning at age 50, to men who are at average risk of prostate cancer and have at least a 10-year life expectancy. But Lyke says other groups recommend that men should be screened once they reach their forties. ""I think it's a financial issue in a lot of cases rather than a health issue as to why that guideline is 50,"" he told CNN. ""The fact of the matter is not many men are going to have prostate cancer in their forties, but for those who do, if they wait until they're 50 to be tested, their numbers aren't going to look very good."" Lyke founded ""Pints for Prostates"" to spread the message about need for regular prostate health screenings. The organization travels to beer festivals and tries to engage with men in an informal way. ""Beer is a universal thing for men,"" Lyke told CNN. ""Where women get together and talk about health issues, men really don't, so we try to use an atmosphere like a pub, where guys are a little bit more relaxed, to talk about prostate cancer."" He says prostate cancer is a highly personal disease for men, in much the same way that breast cancer is for women. Treatment for prostate cancer can sometimes result in impotence. ""The pink ribbon campaign has really made it possible for women to talk about breast cancer, so we're trying to do the same thing for guys. They need permission to talk about it,"" said Lyke. As well as setting up stalls at beer festivals and organizing events in pubs, ""Pints for Prostates"" has run adverts in magazines and Lyke estimates its message has reached about 30 million people. A year after his own surgery, Lyke's first granddaughter was born. He is aware that by being screened for prostate cancer he has vastly improved his chances of seeing her grow up, and he hopes that by encouraging other men to be tested he will give them a similar opportunity. He told CNN, ""I'm hoping that there's a whole bunch of other guys out there who'll be able to experience the same thing [as me] -- see their families grow up and grow old.""

"Detroit, Michigan (CNN) -- Six men appeared in federal court Thursday, a day after they were arrested in raids targeting an African-American Muslim group that the FBI said sought to establish an Islamic state in the United States. Luqman Ameen Abdullah, the alleged leader of the African-American Muslim converts, was fatally shot during one of Wednesday's raids in the Detroit area after he fired at law enforcement agents who were trying to arrest him and four other suspects. An FBI dog was also killed. Authorities say Abdullah was the imam at a Detroit mosque where he preached offensive jihad, including violence against the U.S. government and law enforcement. A criminal complaint states that he repeatedly told three confidential informants he would never be taken alive, saying ""If they're coming to get me, I'll just strap a bomb on and blow up everybody."" Abdullah was one of 11 men charged Tuesday with conspiracy to commit federal crimes, including theft from interstate shipments, mail fraud to obtain the proceeds of arson, illegal possession and sale of firearms, and tampering with motor vehicle identification numbers, the FBI said in a news release. Eight suspects were in custody, including one man already in prison on an unrelated charge and another man who was arrested on Wednesday and added to the charging sheet, U.S. Attorney spokeswoman Susan Plochinski said Thursday. An additional suspect was taken into custody in Canada on Thursday, an FBI statement said. Two men remain at large. Mujahid Carswell, aka Mujahid Abdullah, was taken into custody in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, by Canadian authorities Thursday afternoon, the FBI said. According to the federal criminal complaint, Carswell, 30, is the eldest son of Abdullah, who was killed in the raid Wednesday. Canadian Border Patrol is holding him on immigration violations, the FBI said. Of the six suspects who appeared Thursday afternoon in court, Abdullah Beard was ordered held without bail; and Muhammad Abdul Salaam's bail decision was delayed, as was that for Gary Laverne Porter, a 38-year teacher who was arrested at an area school. Ali Abdul Raqib was given a $10,000 unsecured bond; Abdul Saboor was given a $100,000 bond, despite a prosecution request that he be held without bond. Another man, Acie Pusha, who was arrested Wednesday, was described by the prosecutor as ""minimally involved"" and given a $10,000 bond. The FBI criminal complaint says the group held target practice in a mosque basement, blowing holes in concrete walls. It includes references to possible attacks on the government, including Detroit's federal building and the FBI. There is also discussion about causing trouble at the 2006 Super Bowl in Detroit. But the men were not arrested for any of that. Two law enforcement sources said the information about possible attacks was included in the charging document to add ""context for the crimes they're charged with, the purpose of the group."" ""They had to earn money for their mosque and the Ummah,"" one of the sources said. ""And the purpose of Ummah was to set up a separatist state."" Ummah refers to the nationwide group to which the suspects belonged, according to the complaint. It's a group made up of mostly African-American members, including some who converted to Islam while in prison. Ummah is led by Jamil Abdullah al-Amin -- formerly known as H. Rap Brown -- a 1960s radical and former member of the Black Panthers who once said ""violence was as American as cherry pie."" He is serving a life sentence in Colorado's Supermax prison for killing two Georgia police officers. Andrew Arena, the FBI special agent in charge of the investigation, contacted local imams and civil rights leaders in Detroit during Wednesday's operation ""to bridge any gaps that could possible come over this,"" FBI spokeswoman Sandra Berchtold said. ""He'd rather they hear it from him,"" she added. ""We have a good relationship with the community and we want to keep it that way."" In the 43-page criminal complaint filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Michigan and unsealed Wednesday, authorities said the arrests were made based on information gleaned from confidential sources identified only as S-1, S-2 and S-3. ""S-1 heard Abdullah encourage his followers to 'pick up guns and do something' rather than try to achieve their goals through peaceful means,"" the complaint said. S-2 recorded a conversation on December 12, 2007, in which Abdullah said, ""I got some soldiers with me, so it's not like I, I don't have, you know, nothing. Brothers that I know would, you know, if I say 'Let's go, we going to go and do something,' they would do it,"" the complaint said. S-3 said that, on March 21, 2008, Luqman Abdullah told him ""that the FBI is the enemy of Islam,"" the complaint said. The other men charged were identified as: . • Mohammad Abdul Bassir, aka Franklin D. Roosevelt Williams. He is serving a prison term at Ojibway Correctional Facility in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. • Mujahid Carswell. • Mohammad Philistine. • Yassir Ali Khan. • Adam Hussain Ibraheem. Acie Pusha was arrested on Wednesday and added to the charging sheet, Plochinski said Thursday. She would not provide details about the charges against Pusha. The two charged but still at large are Philistine, also known as Mohammad Alsahi, a 33-year-old resident of Ontario; and Khan, 30, who is believed to be a resident of Ontario and Warren, Michigan. All of the defendants ""are members of a group that is alleged to have engaged in violent activity over a period of many years, and known to be armed,"" the FBI said. The complaint was filed by the FBI's counter-terrorism squad in the Eastern District of Michigan. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Carol Cratty and Ross Levitt contributed to this story.","NEW: Six appear in federal court Thursday, a day after they were arrested in raids .

"New York (CNN) -- Diplomacy hasn't worked. Sanctions have achieved little. Relations between Iran and the United States are, at best, chilly. So why not try music? On Saturday night, for the first time, Iranians were the headline performers at New York City's famed Carnegie Hall.  A father and son from Iran led American musicians in a hybrid session of traditional Iranian and classical Western music. Thirty-year-old Hafez Nazeri told CNN he was pleased to present ""another dimension of Iran and Iranian culture to the Western people."" Nazeri, who now lives in the United States, said, ""We hear mostly about the other side -- bloodshed, chaos -- and I wanted to be able to present the reality of our culture, which is about peace and love and unity."" Nearly 3,000 people, many of them Persians, flocked to Carnegie Hall for the concert. One patron said, ""The message was completely obvious: Love all the way. Peace!"" The Nazeris said it was an honor to be onstage at the historic music center. The younger Nazeri said his music might be able to bridge cultural divides between Iran and the United States. His father, Shahrem, still lives in Iran. Speaking in Farsi, the man known as the Iranian Pavarotti talked about the demonstrations that followed June's disputed Iranian presidential election. The tenor said some of the people in the streets are ""requesting something, and I think it's important to answer to their requests. The government should answer to their requests and they have to see what their people want."" The Nazeris are two of the few Iranian musicians allowed to freely travel and perform in Iran. Western-style popular music is banned in Iran. With just a few musicians, they form a rare group, blending Persian traditional themes with Western classical style. It's very simple in presentation: a cello, percussion and an improvised setar -- a Persian instrument like a lute -- played by Hafez Nazeri. The Nazeris' music is based on the 13th-century Persian poet and philosopher Rumi. ""The idea of the music is to bring unity and to be able to create a music that is not just for Iranians, it's for people from all over the world,"" the younger Nazeri said. Rachel Cooper, director of cultural programs and performing arts at the Asia Society, said, ""You're seeing the Iranian culture and the Western culture in something that's a kind of hybrid, that I think represents the times that we live in."" The Nazeris receive cultural support from the nonprofit New York-based Asia Society, Cooper told CNN. ""We've been going through this time period where we've been thinking about the Berlin Wall coming down, and throughout that period of the Cold War, cultural relations were always a really important component. So I think that cultural relations -- music in particular -- are a really important part of how we know each other as human beings,"" Cooper said. The Nazeris have performed in cities across the United States in recent years.","Hafez Nazeri and his father Shahrem play hybrid of Iranian and Western music .

"Nashville, Tennessee (CNN) -- One-third of Americans have a favorable view of the Tea Party movement, but a plurality has no opinion at all, according to a new national poll. A CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey indicates that 26 percent of the public has an unfavorable view of the Tea Party movement and that 4 in 10 have not heard of the movement or don't know enough to form an opinion. The poll's Friday-morning release comes as what's billed as the first national Tea Party convention begins its first full day of meetings in Nashville. ""The Tea Party movement is a blank slate to many Americans, which is not surprising for a political movement that is only about a year old,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""Not surprisingly, opinion breaks along partisan and ideological lines."" According to the survey, Democrats by a 2-to-1 margin have an unfavorable view of the Tea Party movement; Republicans like it by a 3-to-1 margin. Among independents, 35 percent of independents holding a positive view and 24 percent a negative view. What's the future of the Tea Party movement? On Saturday, Sarah Palin will serve as the convention's keynote speaker. The also poll indicates that Americans are split on the former Alaska governor and 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee, with 43 percent seeing her in a positive light and 46 percent holding an unfavorable view. ""Opinion on Sarah Palin also breaks down along party lines, with seven in 10 Democrats disliking her and seven in 10 Republicans with a positive view. She has a net-negative rating among independents: 42 percent favorable and 47 percent unfavorable,"" Holland added. ""She also continues to rate better among men than women."" The Tea Party movement developed last year in protest to what its supporters saw as overspending in Washington -- by both Republicans and Democrats -- after the stimulus bill, the bank bailouts and President Obama's budget. The poll was conducted January 22-24, with 1,009 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.

"(CNN) -- Colombia and the United States signed an agreement Friday that allows U.S. personnel to be stationed at seven military bases in the South American nation. The United States says it needs the bases to help in its fight against terrorists and narcotraffickers, especially since the closure a few months ago of a U.S. base in Ecuador. The United States maintains similar ""forward operating locations"" in El Salvador and Aruba-Curacao. Colombia's agreement to host the Americans has come under harsh criticism in Latin America, particularly from President Hugo Chavez in neighboring Venezuela. Chavez has likened the agreement to an act of war and accuses the United States of wanting to stage military personnel nearby to destabilize his leftist government. The U.S. forward operating location in Aruba-Curacao is off the northern coast of Venezuela. The United States linked Colombia's agreement to a trade pact the South American nation wants. Colombia also stands to gain from U.S. help in the nation's 45-year-old war against Marxist guerrillas known as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, commonly called FARC. Colombian Foreign Minister Jaime Bermudez, Defense Minister Gabriel Silva and Interior and Justice Minister Fabio Valencia Cossio were joined by U.S. Ambassador William Brownfield in signing the document Friday in Bogota, the nation's capital.","U.S. military personnel may be stationed at seven Colombian bases .

"(CNN) --  I spoke at TED in 2006, the year they started to put the talks online. I'm told that since then, the talk has been downloaded more than 3.5 million times in more than 200 countries. The number of people who've seen it may be 20 times that or more. I have a stream of e-mails, tweets and blog posts round the world from young people, parents, students, teachers, cultural activists and business leaders of all sorts. They tell me how deeply they relate to the talk and often that they've seen or shown it many times at meetings, conferences, workshops and retreats. Parents tell me they've shown it to their children; young people tell me they've shown it to their parents. They say they've laughed and sometimes cried together and had a different sort of conversation as a result. Changing the conversation is one of the primary purposes of TED. Why has this talk had such an impact? I think there are several reasons. To begin with, the talk is short. The 18-minute talk is part of the genius of TED. In a world of instant messaging, rampant data and overspecialization, brevity is a virtue. (Even so, I've seen blogs that strongly recommend the talk but warn that it's almost 20 minutes long.) A second factor is that, based on the audience's reaction, the talk is entertaining and funny at times, which always helps. And I'd just had my hair cut. We may never know how much that simple act contributed to the global appeal of the talk. But the real reason for its impact is that what I'm saying clearly resonates deeply with people of all ages and across many different cultures. I believe that the argument is becoming more urgent by the day. What is the argument? In a nutshell, it's that we're all born with immense natural talents but our institutions, especially education, tend to stifle many of them and as a result we are fomenting a human and an economic disaster. In education, this vast waste of talent involves a combination of factors. They include a narrow emphasis on certain sorts of academic work; the exile of arts, humanities and physical education programs from schools; arid approaches to teaching math and sciences; an obsessive culture of standardized testing and tight financial pressures to teach to the tests. The result is a disastrous waste of talent among students and their teachers. To sense the scale of this disaster, you only have to look at the alarming rates of turnover among faculty and the levels of drop out, disaffection, stress and prescription drug use among students. Even for students who stay the course and do well in education, the rules of success have changed irrevocably. Just look at the plummeting value of college degrees. The waste of talent in education is not deliberate. Teachers are as anxious about this as everyone else, but many of them feel trapped in the awkward groping of national reform policies, many of which misunderstand the problems as well as the solutions. The waste of talent isn't deliberate, but it is systematic. It happens in part because the dominant systems of education are rooted in the values and demands of industrialism: they are linear, mechanistic and focused on conformity and standardization. Nowadays, they're buttressed by major commercial interests in mass testing and by the indiscriminate use of prescription drugs that keep students' minds from wandering to things they naturally find more interesting. The tragedy is that meeting the many social, economic, spiritual and environmental challenges we now face depends absolutely on the very capacities of insight, creativity and innovation that these systems are systematically suppressing in yet another generation of young people. Reforming these systems is not enough. The truth is that we are caught up in a cultural and economic revolution. This revolution is global in scale and unpredictable in nature. To meet it, we need a revolution in the culture of education. This new culture has to emerge from a richer sense of human ability. To shape it, I believe we have to leave behind the manufacturing principles of industrialism and embrace the organic principles of ecology. Education is about developing human beings, and human development is not mechanical or linear. It is organic and dynamic. Like all living forms, we flourish in certain conditions and shrivel in others. Great teachers, great parents and great leaders understand those conditions intuitively; poor ones don't. The answer is not to standardize education, but to personalize and customize it to the needs of each child and community. There is no alternative. There never was. The good news is that all around the world there are wonderful examples of people and organizations that are making determined efforts to do things differently in education -- and in business, health care, architecture, communities and cultural programs. There are examples of these all over the TED Web site and in the expanding ripples of the TED prizes. TED itself is a great example of the spirit of collaboration and inter-disciplinarily that is the essential to a genuine culture of creativity. What are the principles of this culture? Towards the end of my talk, I mention a book I was working on called ""Epiphany."" It was published this year under a much better title, ""The Element: How Finding Your Passion Changes Everything"" (Viking) and is now in 11 languages. It draws on conversations with people in science, business, education, the arts, sports and more on how they found in themselves the talents and passions that have shaped their lives. But the book is not about them: it's about you and your children, if you have any; and your friends too, if you have any of those. There's a wealth of talent that lies in all of us. All of us, including those who work in schools, must nurture creativity systematically and not kill it unwittingly. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sir Ken Robinson.","Sir Ken Robinson: We're born with great natural talents .
He says schools systematically suppress many of those innate talents .
Schools use testing and other systems to narrowly assess students, he says .
He says they devalue forms of creativity that don't fit in academic contexts ."
"(CNN) -- The election victory of Massachusetts Sen.-elect Scott Brown is expected to be certified Thursday, which could allow him to be sworn in as early as Thursday afternoon to replace the late Sen. Ted Kennedy. Brown's win stripped Democrats of their 60-seat, filibuster-proof majority in the U.S. Senate and raised fears among many congressional Democrats about a potential GOP landslide in November's midterm elections. Brian McNiff, spokesman for Massachusetts' secretary of state, said the final election returns from last month's special election were delivered to the governor's office Wednesday. Brown had asked for immediate certification. In a letter to Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and Secretary of State William Galvin, Brown's attorney says the Republican senator-elect had planned on being sworn in on February 11, but he has been told that several Senate votes will be held before then. ""For this reason, he wants certification to occur immediately,"" attorney Daniel Winslow wrote.","Victory of Massachusetts senator-elect is expected to be certified Thursday .
