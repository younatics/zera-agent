One of the richest men in the world says a £1.7m painting he bought at Christie's is a fake, and today he takes his fight to the High Court to get his money back. Prolific art collector and oil tycoon, Viktor Vekselberg, says the nude painting he bought in 2005 could not possibly be by prominent Russian artist Boris Kustodiev - as it was signed years after his death. The 56-year-old, believed to be worth more than £7bn and rated 64th richest person in the world, is calling on a bank of top art experts to prove that the painting of a nude woman reclining on a bed, known as 'Odalisque', is by an unknown artist. Real or fake: Viktor Vekselberg believes the painting 'Odalisque', by Boris Kustodiev and sold to him by Christie's, is by another artist . But Christie's are standing firmly by the attribution they made before the sale and are calling on their own eminent team of experts to establish the painting as an authentic Kustodiev. The battle to prove the the providence of the painting will last 19 days, and centre around a tiny signature in cyrillic script - said to be that of Kustodiev and dated 1919. 64th richest man: Viktor Vekselberg also collects Fabergé eggs . Henry Legge QC, for Aurora Fine Arts, through which the painting was purchased, said careful analysis of the signature showed it 'running over' existing cracks in the paint and indicated that it was not written until the late 1940s. Kustodiev died in 1927. Also highlighting the use of an aluminium-based pigment on the canvas, the QC said it was of a type which was not commonly used by artists until after Kustodiev's death. 'Odalisque' was returned to Christie's after doubts about its authenticity were raised after the sale. The painting was placed on an easel in court for Mr Justice Newey to view. However, the case began with a dispute over which side should have physical custody of the painting, which Aurora's legal team wants to subject to further tests. Mr Legge said microscopic, extremely high resolution, photography of the signature could prove conclusively whether it was appended in 1919 or 'considerably later'. The famous auction house Christie's stand by their original research into the painting . He added that, if a 'cross-sectional . test' of the signature showed a layer of dust between it and the pigment . beneath, that would also support Aurora's case. James . Aldridge, for Christie's, did not object to fresh photographs being . taken, but said cross-sectional testing would be 'unethical' and . 'extraordinarily invasive', given the very small size of the signature. Through a detailed comparison between . 'Odalisque' and authenticated works by Kustodiev, Christie's insists . that the technique, subject matter and other similarities support the . attribution to the Russian master. They . also say the Aluminium-based pigment identified in the painting was in . use by artists in 1919, although not as commonly as in the 1930s. The . High Court hearing - the legal costs of which are likely to equal - if . not exceed - the sum paid for the painting seven years ago, continues. Self-portrait: Boris Kustodiev in 1912 . Boris Kustodiev was born in 1878 in Astrakhan is southern Russia. He lost his father at an early age, forcing his family to move into a rich merchant's house, which he said would inspire his paintings for the rest of his life. He moved in stage-set design and book illustrating, and then gained a name for himself as a painter, in particular for his portraits. Kustodiev moved to St Petersberg and entered the Academy of Arts, becoming a student of the artist Repin. His paintings and satirical drawings of the aftermath of the Bolshevik Revolution are often seen as a symbol of Russia in the 1920s. Sadly, tuberculosis of the spine took a toll on him, eventually leaving his legs paralysed, but despite this he continued to paint up-beat paintings about his beloved homeland.","Oil tycoon Viktor Vekselberg believes 'Odalisque' is a fake .

Lost his post: Commander Andy Coles was returning to his cabin when HUMS Astute headed into a sandbank . The commander of the Royal Navy’s newest nuclear-powered submarine was taking a shower minutes before it ran aground, an official inquiry has concluded. The 24-page report says Commander Andy Coles was spotted returning to his cabin as HMS Astute, the UK’s most advanced hunter-killer sub, headed into a sandbank. The embarrassing detail is included in the inquiry which found that a catalogue of errors contributed to the beaching of the £1billion submarine off the west coast of Scotland on October 22, 2010. It adds that the 330ft flagship vessel, which had surfaced, ran aground on shingle off the Isle of Skye because the officer on the bridge was not using the correct radar, did not have a chart and was not used to navigating in the dark. The Navy’s humiliation was compounded when a rescue vessel crashed into HMS Astute, causing even more damage. The cost of repairs to the sub is understood to have run into hundreds of millions of pounds. Nobody has been court martialed over the incident, but the Navy said three officers had been disciplined. The Ministry of Defence refused to name those who were blamed, but Cdr Coles, 47, lost his post a month after the incident. The report said the sub was late for a rendezvous with another ship and ended up ‘cutting a corner’. Once Astute was stuck, senior officers also failed to take the correct action because ‘the gentle nature of the grounding did not give any cause for immediate concern’. Aground: HMS Astute is freed after getting stuck off the west coast of Scotland in October 2010. The vessel ran aground on shingle because the correct radar was not being used . Rear Admiral Ian Corder, head of the submarine service, said he accepted all the findings. He added: ‘The submarine service has learned from this incident.’ John Ainslie, co-ordinator of Scottish CND, said: ‘The report reads like the script of an episode from Dad’s Army. It is a catalogue of obvious failures which led inexorably to an embarrassing fiasco. ‘The people commanding the Navy’s newest nuclear submarine showed even less competence than Captain Mainwaring and Corporal Jones.’ Blunder: HMS Astute returns to its base at Faslane for checks after it ran aground.

Tragically Jack Kelly, 59, collapsed at the end . of the Scottish Communities League Cup final at Hampden Park as his Kilmarnock midfielder son Liam Kelly, 22, achieved the crowning moment of his career so far. As elated players celebrated their against the odds victory over giants Celtic, paramedics treated Mr Kelly near the Kilmarnock dugout and his distraught son was spotted sprinting from the field to be by his father's side. The 22-year-old was then seen is tears and had to be held up by bystanders. Tragic: Liam Kelly of Kilmarnock, right, tackles Scott Brown of Celtic during his team's cup final win but his father had a heart attack as he watched the famous victory . Mr Kelly was taken to hospital in Glasgow yesterday, where he died around an hour later. Kilmarnock's players were not told of the incident until after they lifted the trophy, but players were seen in floods of tears soon afterwards. The dramatic incident came on the same weekend Bolton Wanderers midfielder Fabrice Muamba had to be treated on the pitch after his heart stopped during his team's FA Cup quarter final against Spurs.

Still shaken: Leanne Zaloumis was remanded in custody today after breaking in to Simon Cowell's house on Saturday night . Armed police were sent to the home of Simon Cowell after a woman allegedly battered her way in wielding a broken brick. Leanne Zaloumis, 29, is accused of breaking into the pop mogul’s £9million mansion by smashing his bathroom window with a rock after scrambling on to a flat roof. Cowell, 52, was left terrified after coming face to face with the woman who was said to be standing on the roof outside his shattered bathroom window holding a rock above her head, with her hands covered in blood. The X Factor creator fled to his bedroom and his staff called Scotland Yard who immediately sent a squad of armed officers to his home. After searching the grounds and gardens, firearms officers found an intruder hiding on a shelf seven feet up in a walk-in wardrobe with blood-smeared walls adjoining Cowell’s bedroom. Yesterday Cowell was not present to see the accused woman, wearing a baggy grey sweatshirt, appear in court for the first time since the alleged break-in on Saturday night. A charge of aggravated burglary with intent was read to her. Paul Mitchell, prosecuting, said she ‘entered, as a trespasser, a dwelling with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm upon a person therein and at the time of committing the said burglary had with you a weapon of offence, namely a broken house brick’. West London Magistrates’ Court heard how Cowell was watching TV in his  bedroom at 10.30pm when he heard a ‘loud bang’ in his bathroom on the first floor of his lavish home in West London, which used to be the French ambassador’s residence. On entering the bathroom to investigate, he was confronted by a figure standing on a flat roof outside the window screaming as she held a rock aloft, Mr Mitchell said. He told the court: ‘On Saturday 24th March around half past ten in the evening, Simon Cowell, a relatively high-profile celebrity, was watching TV in his bedroom. 'He then hears what he describes as a loud bang that he says comes from his bathroom which is located next to his bedroom.' ‘He goes to investigate and sees a figure outside his first-floor bathroom window. He could see that the window was already damaged and there was broken glass on the floor and around the window frame.’ Tuning in: Cowell was watching himself on The Jonathan Ross Show when the break-in occurred . Cowell has said that outside the window he could see a woman who was shouting and holding a rock above her head. He said he tried to speak to her but she continued to shout at him and then started to hit the window again with the rock. Panicked, Cowell ran for help and a member of staff called police while others searched the garden and grounds. Within minutes, firearms officers had arrived. With weapons drawn they searched his home, eventually finding a woman hiding on the shelf in the wardrobe where blood had been smeared on the walls during the ‘disturbing and frenzied’ break-in. A woman was arrested at the scene and taken to a West London police station. Nothing was found on her apart from a few possessions including a coat and a handbag which did not belong to Cowell. He told a friend: ‘It was scary . . . she was smashing her way into my bathroom with a rock and wouldn’t stop. Then she hid in the house.’ Homebody: Cowell pictured outside his London home in 2010 . 'Freaked out': The TV judge, pictured in one of his Bentleys, suffered a previous security lapse in 2008 when his £140,000 luxury car was found to have been bugged with a magnetic tracking device . Cowell has 24-hour security at the property, which includes a team of guards based there. Bodyguards also join him at the studios during filming for his TV shows including Britain’s Got Talent and The X Factor. Yesterday experts were examining how to make the mansion more secure. Staff were cleaning the house to remove any traces of glass and blood left in the bathroom and wardrobe, which were said to have been caused by lacerations to the intruder’s hands. Zaloumis spoke yesterday only to  confirm her name and her address in Catford, South-East London. District Judge James Henderson remanded her in custody to appear again at Isleworth Crown Court on June 12.","Leanne Zaloumis, 29, remanded in custody by magistrates .

"By . Katherine Faulkner . UPDATED: . 06:55 EST, 13 February 2012 . Wealthy background: The state is footing the bill for Vincent Tabak's team of lawyers even though he earned a £45,000 salary as a consultant engineer . Joanna Yeates’s parents spoke of their anger last night as it emerged that the legal bill for their daughter’s killer could cost taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds. Dutchman Vincent Tabak, 34, is serving a life sentence for strangling the 25-year-old landscape architect at her home before dumping her body nearby. The taxpayer has already paid £6,000 towards the bill for the leading barrister and a team of lawyers who represented Tabak, despite the fact that he earned about £45,000 a year as a consultant engineer. But legal experts say the final bill for the public purse could run into hundreds of thousands. Even though Tabak could be ordered to pay some of his costs, it is unlikely he could afford the entire amount. Yesterday Miss Yeates’s parents said they were ‘outraged’ by the revelation. ‘It’s ridiculous he should get that level of legal aid,’ her father David, 63, said yesterday. ‘He comes from a wealthy background and he showed contempt to the court, to us, to his girlfriend and her family. ‘He should never have received taxpayers’ money to defend himself.’ Mr Yeates added that Tabak could have saved the family additional heartache, as well as reducing the costs of his trial, by admitting murder earlier on. ‘He prolonged the case by lying to the police and lying during his trial,’ he said. ‘To this day, he has never acknowledged outside court that he killed Jo. We feel he should now be held to account in every way possible.’ Even Tabak’s own barrister admitted to the court during the trial that his client’s behaviour while he tried to cover his tracks had been ‘disgusting’. In the days after killing Miss Yeates at her Bristol home in December 2010, Tabak put his victim’s family through a ‘week of hell’ by insisting he knew nothing about her disappearance. Ordeal: Joanna Yeates's parents, David and Teresa (left), say they are 'outraged' that the man who murdered their daughter (right) could end up costing the taxpayer hundreds of thousands of pounds in legal bills . Distraught: A heartbroken Mr and Mrs Yeates (centre) visit the site where Joanna's body was found two days earlier in December 2010. Tabak prolonged their pain by lying to police and not admitting the murder . This meant her body was not found for several days after she was reported missing. Tabak, a neighbour of Miss Yeates,  also told police a pack of lies and even  pointed the finger at his innocent landlord, Chris Jefferies. Tabak then forced Miss Yeates’s  family through the further agony of a  six-week murder trial by admitting only to manslaughter. He told the court that he had panicked and placed his hand over her mouth after she screamed when he tried to kiss her. Big bills: Tabak was defended by top barrister William Clegg QC (above) and also had a team of solicitors at Kelcey and Hall, which has invoiced legal aid authorities for the trial costs . Her parents said watching Tabak’s ‘lies’ and ‘words of self pity’ in the witness box had been ‘more stressful and intense than they ever imagined’. At one point, Miss Yeates’s mother, Teresa, broke down in tears as the court was shown a picture of her daughter lying in a mortuary. At the trial, the Dutchman was defended by one of the country’s top barristers, William Clegg, QC. He also had a defence team of between four and six led by a highly paid partner in the Somerset law firm Kelcey and Hall Solicitors, whose legal bill is yet to be settled. Legal aid authorities confirmed yesterday that they had received a bill from Kelcey and Hall for work for Tabak’s trial. Although the bill had not been settled, one legal source said: ‘You are looking at an enormous bill. It will be a considerable sum of money.’ Tabak strangled Miss Yeates just minutes after she arrived home alone following Christmas drinks with friends in December 2010. He drove her battered body to a secluded lane and dumped it by the roadside, where it was found on Christmas morning by a couple walking their dog. A consultant engineer, Tabak earned . around £45,000 a year as a ‘people-flow analyst’ for the global . engineering consultancy Buro Happold, where he had worked since moving . to England in 2007. Brutal death: A police officer stands guard outside Joanna's flat, where she was strangled by Tabak after returning home alone following Christmas drinks . The pilot’s son, who is from an affluent Dutch family, had also been saving to buy a flat with his girlfriend Tanja Morson. Despite Tabak’s apparently comfortable finances, the Legal Services Commission has already paid Crossmans Solicitors in Somerset £2,986 for his legal advice when he was arrested, and £3,358.98 for work carried out at crown court, including £2,523 for ‘disbursements’ and £835 for ‘litigation’. A Legal Services Commission spokesperson said the full amount of Tabak’s legal aid would eventually be made public. He said: 'Anyone facing a crown court trial can apply for legal aid. This ensures these often complex trials are heard thoroughly and fairly. 'Defendants can be made to pay a substantial monthly contribution. This is due to a means testing scheme. If convicted in the crown court, anyone with over £30,000 capital assets can be made to pay an additional contribution.'","State paying for Vincent Tabak's trial defence even though he earned £45k .

Heading the flotilla would be a return to the position of nautical leadership Prince Charles first held in command of the Royal Navy minesweeper HMS Bronington in 1976 . Prince Charles is planning to sail ahead of the Queen in a separate boat at the Diamond Jubilee River Pageant – heading a mini-Royal armada. He wants to lead the 1,000-vessel parade on the newly built Royal Rowboat Gloriana, a cross between a giant gondola and a Viking longboat. There is even speculation that Prince William and Kate, as well as Prince Harry, could be on a third vessel of their own. It had originally been hoped that the Queen would sail on the £500,000 gilded Gloriana – which was commissioned as a gift for her from P&O president Lord Sterling of Plaistow. But the vessel is not big enough to accommodate her security staff and other members of the Royal Family. Instead, the Queen and Prince Philip will be on board the Royal Barge, Spirit of Chartwell, a luxurious cruiser that is being customised in 17th century style for the occasion. The Duchess of Cornwall, who  is not comfortable on the water, is likely to join Her Majesty for the pageant along the Thames in London on Sunday, June 3. Prince Charles discussed the plans at a meeting last Wednesday with the Thames Diamond Jubilee Foundation’s chairman Lord Salisbury and its chief executive, Michael Lockett. The 63-year-old heir to the throne came up with the idea for a river  pageant four years ago. He is said to be keen to push ahead with his plan to use the hand-built Gloriana if organisers and Royal security officers agree. Heading the flotilla would be a . return to the position of nautical  leadership he first held in command . of the Royal Navy minesweeper HMS Bronington in 1976. Gloriana has been granted the Queen’s . official Royal status. Powered by 18 oarsmen, it also has two engines . which can be used as an alternative, and comes equipped with flushing . toilets and hot and cold running water. It has a capacity of 50 passengers and will be helmed by the Queen’s Bargemaster. Royal Watermen will row the boat the . seven miles along the Thames from Putney to Tower Bridge in a spectacle . expected to  surpass the floating pageant in 1662 that celebrated the . restoration of Charles II to the Throne. Gloriana has been granted the Queen's official Royal status. Powered by 18 oarsmen, it also has two engines which can be used as an alternative, and comes equipped with flushing toilets and hot and cold running water . Earlier this month, Lord Sterling told how Prince Charles had come up with the idea of giving Gloriana to the Queen four years ago. The Tory peer said: ‘He asked me to come up with a few thoughts on an appropriate boat. That’s when I had this idea.’ A senior Royal aide told The Mail  on Sunday: ‘The plans for the pageant are still being worked on, but Prince Charles may well end up on his own boat. It is one idea being discussed.’ Organisers are said to be in favour of splitting up the Royals on to two vessels in order to add to the spectacle of the occasion. ‘Everything has to be passed by the Queen for her approval,’ an aide said last night. ‘It’s likely that most family members will be on Spirit of Chartwell.’ However, the likelihood of William, Kate and Harry sailing on their own barge has been downplayed, as it is said to be unlikely courtiers would want attention further diverted from the Queen. A spokesman for the pageant said: ‘We can confirm that the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will be on the Royal Barge. 'We will be able to release details of other members of the Royal Family closer to the time.’ Soundtrack: The flotilla will be divided into 10 sections with music herald barges separating each group, playing music composed especially for the event, including church bells, herald fanfare trumpeters and an orchestra from the Academy of Ancient Music . The 1,000-boat tribute will feature vessels from down the centuries on the River Thames, a seven-mile long procession of Dunkirk little ships, historic vessels, steam boats and tugs, rowed shallops and Dutch barges and passenger ships .","Prince wants to lead 1,000-vessel parade in Royal Rowboat Gloriana ."

Sick: Paedophile David Bryant snatched four little girls from the street in the 1980s and 1990s and was jailed for 16 years . A paedophile who snatched four young girls off the street and sexually . abused them was finally behind bars last night after an extraordinary . DNA breakthrough, 30 years after his first attack. David Bryant, 65, kidnapped the four girls, aged between three and five, . in the 1980s and 1990s and subjected them to horrific ordeals that . lasted several hours. Each of his victims was abducted in daylight as they played outside. Two were dumped, in tears and miles from home. Bryant avoided justice for three decades, but after police arrested a . relative in connection with an unrelated matter, they used pioneering . DNA technology, called familial profiling, to positively link Bryant to . the unsolved cases. Yesterday he was jailed for 16 years at Newcastle Crown Court. Following . months of courtroom denials, he had changed his pleas to guilty at an . earlier hearing. Bryant left his victims and their families ‘traumatised’ for 30 years. One victim, now in her thirties, told the court: ‘Since the incident, . whenever I hear an ice-cream van I am left with chills all over my body. It is exactly the same with woods and I avoid them at all costs.’ His catalogue of sickening crimes began in August 1982, when he snatched . a five-year-old girl from outside her home in Gosport, Hampshire, as . she played with her brother and friends, the court heard. When she . reappeared, she told her mother how a man had lured her to an alleyway . with the promise of sweets and had sexually assaulted her. Less than a year later, Bryant snatched a three-year-old girl as she . played near her home in Southampton, Hampshire. He took her to nearby . woods and sexually abused her. Bryant later moved to Saudi Arabia but returned in 1994 with a new . partner and settled in Ulverston, Cumbria, where he worked as a taxi . driver. Cold case: Police in Newcastle search for evidence at the scene of one of Bryant's kidnappings, collecting DNA that eventually led to his conviction this year . Haunting: Bryant as he was pictured in a sketch 17 years ago but his decades of crime would not catch up with him until police re-opened the case . Within a year he had kidnapped a five-year-old as she played outside her home in Blakelaw, Newcastle. After subjecting her to an ordeal lasting more than three hours, Bryant dumped her miles away in the centre of Darlington. Eventually, she was found by a taxi driver, wearing only her lilac . anorak, white ankle socks and shoes. Four months later a four-year-old . was abducted in Newcastle’s West End as she walked 90 yards from her . home to her mother’s best friend. The next day she was found knocking on a door in Darlington, telling the woman who answered: ‘I’ve lost my daddy.’ Officers kept a strain of DNA on file, taken from an item of clothing belonging to one of the girls. When Bryant’s relative was arrested in May last year, they took his DNA . and discovered a familial match. The relative was not charged with any . offence. Bryant, who has previous convictions for sexual offences dating back to . 1975, was arrested and his DNA was found to be a perfect match. Outside court, Detective Chief Inspector Steve Binks of Northumbria . Police described the abductions as ‘every parent’s worst nightmare’. ‘For 30 years, Bryant left these victims and their families traumatised . by his despicable actions and has shown absolutely no remorse,’ he said. ‘With advances in DNA technology, and the joint work with Hampshire .

Asma al-Assad, the British-born wife of the Syrian president, told a friend in a leaked email that she was the ‘real dictator’ in the family. Mrs Assad, 36, appears to show no misgivings about the regime’s brutal crackdown against dissenters, according to the latest extracts from her private emails. She praises a speech by her husband for conveying a sense of being ‘very strong, no more messing around.’ And she even makes light of the president’s reputation, joking in one exchange with a friend about domestic relations: ‘As for listening - I am the REAL dictator, he has no choice.’ Mrs al-Assad is often portrayed as an unwitting partner to her husband as he conducts a campaign of violence against many of his own people. But the string of emails sent to her husband as well as friends and family members, shows she is, in fact, fully behind his policies. In one message to a family friend she refers to a speech her husband had made describing it as 'very strong, no more messing around'. And she even changed the wording of a viral joke email, to make fun of the people of Homs - the city at the centre of the uprising where the United Nations estimates thousands have been killed. She had received the email - with the subject line 'Student who obtained 0% in exam' - from her husband. But before she forwarded it on to her father and two other family members she changed the wording to read: 'A really bright Homsi student'. In another email her father, Harley Street cardiologist Dr Fawak Akhras, compared the Syrian government's assault on Homs to Britain's reaction to the riots last summer. Mrs Assad, who has three children, grew up in leafy Acton. Although Muslim, she went to a Church of England school, where friends called her Emma. After studying computer science and French literature at King’s College, London, she worked as a banker at JP Morgan in the Nineties when she started secretly dating Bashar, the nerdy former eye doctor being groomed to succeed his despotic father in Syria. Bashar took power in 2000 amidst hopes he would relax the regime and dismantle the network of security forces. But despite many promises, there have been few real changes. The collection of around around 3,000 emails from the private accounts of the couple were obtained by opposition activists who have released them to the media. In one sent to her husband on December 28th she shows she is fully aware just how serious the threat to his regime had got. 'If we are strong together, we will overcome this together .... I love you.' 'We will overcome this together': Despite the killing and oppression of his own people, Bashar al-Assad's wife is standing by him . Although they do not use each others' real names, experts say they are certain the emails are genuine and that the true identities are beyond reasonable doubt. Other emails revealed how, as the fighting in Syria raged, Mrs al-Assad was mainly concerned with how to get around international sanctions that prevented her from shopping online. ‘I am absolutely clueless when it comes to fine jewellery,’ she wrote to her cousin while awaiting a delivery of gold, onyx and diamond-encrusted necklaces being made for her in Paris. In another email she oragnises a delivery of new furniture through a Dubai shipping company. Meanwhile in Syria government forces clashed with gunmen in an upscale neighborhood of the capital Damascus - home to embassies and senior officials - in one of the worst confrontations in the tightly-controlled city center in the country's yearlong uprising. The pro-government reports said the clash left three 'terrorists' and a member of the security forces dead. It said one of the attackers was captured and three security troops were wounded.

Investigators inspect the blast scene outside a damaged building following a car bomb in Syria's second largest city of Aleppo . Shocking violence: Syrians were left reeling after the dramatic blasts at security buildings in the heart of the troubled country's capital Damascus. Damascus has been largely free of the daily shootings and deaths reported across the country since the uprising against Assad began in March last year. But the capital has witnessed several major bomb attacks targeting security facilities, most recently on Saturday. The government blames 'terrorists' for the bombings but the opposition says that the regime itself may be carrying them out to discredit the uprising. The new fighting shows that rebels can still strike in the heart of the capital despite successful government offensive in the past weeks in the suburbs of Damascus, in the central city of Homs and the northern region of Idlib.

He said the clashes were followed with raids by security forces who were searching for the attackers. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which has a network of activists throughout Syria, said 18 of Assad's troops were wounded in the clashes. It described the clashes ""as the most violent of its kind and closest to security centers in Damascus since the revolution began."" The rebel Free Syrian Army, which includes thousands of army defectors, have claimed responsibility in the past for attacks against regime forces. The group's leader, Col. Riad al-Asaad, refused to comment on the fighting in Damascus when contacted by The Associated Press by telephone. ""This is a sensitive military matter that we cannot comment about,"" he said from Turkey. On Saturday, three suicide bombings in Damascus killed 27 people. Two of them also targeted government security buildings. On Sunday, an explosion killed two and wounded 30 in the northern city of Aleppo, Syria's largest. Arms deliveries to Syria surged almost 600 percent from 2007 to 2011 compared with the previous five years, a leading think tank said on Monday, with Russia supplying the bulk of the country's weapons. The report underlined how Moscow has continued to supply Syria with firepower while the United States, European Union and others have imposed arms embargoes in response to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's bloody crackdown on unrest. World powers have been unable to stop more than a year of bloodshed in Syria, a country that sits on the fault lines of several regional and ethnic conflicts. Recent army gains against rebel positions have not succeeded in quelling the violence and no negotiated settlement is in sight. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)said Russia had supplied 78 per cent of Syria's weapons imports during the past five years, contributing to a 580 per cent increase in the volume of arms imports by Syria. 'The transfer of arms to states affected by the Arab Spring has provoked public and parliamentary debate in a number of supplier states,"" said Mark Bromley, senior researcher with the SIPRI Arms Transfers Programme. 'However, the impact of these debates on states' arms export policies has, up to now, been limited.' Global arms transfers in the period rose by almost a quarter. The five largest importers were all Asian states, with Asia and Oceania accounting for 44 percent of purchases, followed by Europe at 19 percent, the Middle East at 17 percent, the Americas 11 percent and Africa 9 percent. India was the world's single largest importer of arms, accounting for 10 percent of the total, followed by South Korea, Pakistan, China and Singapore. China, the largest recipient of arms during the previous 2002-2006 period, fell in the rankings due to increased domestic production. SIPRI uses a system which attempts to measure volume rather than the financial value of weapons transfers. It does this by using a methodology which intends instead to represent the transfer of military resources.","Asma al-Assad, 36, joked about the people of Homs as troops slaughtered thousands in rebel-held city .

The hunt for all those behind the Lockerbie bombing goes on and Scotland’s top law officer has visited Libya with the head of the FBI to discuss the manhunt. Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland and Robert Mueller travelled to Tripoli last week to meet the Libyan prime minister. They want to pave the way for investigators to visit the country to hunt for the others responsible for Britain’s worst mass murder. Terror: The aircraft cockpit of Pan Am 103 after the plane exploded over the Scottish town on Lockerbie killing 270 people in 1988 . Lockerbie: Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland has visited Libya with FBI director Robert Mueller to discuss the investigation into the Lockerbie bombing . The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (Copfs) said the meeting, which took place on Wednesday April 25, was not publicised at the time for security reasons. A spokesman said: ‘The Lord Advocate, Frank Mulholland QC, and Robert S Mueller, director of the FBI, met with the Libyan prime minister Abdurahim el-Keib to discuss the ongoing investigation into the Lockerbie bombing. ‘The Libyan authorities confirmed that they fully understood the importance of dealing with the tragic issues left behind by Colonel Gaddafi and his regime, both in Libya and overseas. ‘The Lord Advocate expressed his desire to the Libyan prime minister that there will be a positive response to his recent request for co-operation and the international letter of request (ILOR)’. A total of 270 people were killed when Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie in Dumfries-shire four days before Christmas in 1988. Moammar Gadhafi's daughter Aisha has renewed her calls for the United Nations Security Council to investigate her fathers death as a possible war crime, CNN reports. Ms Gadhafi, a lawyer, first made the call last year and was told a strategy for any investigation would be outlined to the Security Council this month. Ms Gadhafi's father ruled Libya for nearly 42 years, but was killed in October by Libyan opposition forces. Gadhafi was initially captured alive and unharmed as troops overran his hometown of Sirte. According to Mahmoud Jibril, then Libya's interim prime minister, a gunbattle broke out as Gadhafi was being loaded into a vehicle leaving him with a wound to his right arm. More shooting erupted as the vehicle drove away, and Gadhafi was hit in the head, Jibril said, with the former leader dying moments later. Grainy video broadcast around the world showed the bloodied but still-alive Gadhafi being hauled onto a truck. Another video showed a dead Gadhafi with what appeared to be a head wound. Libya's U.S. ambassador Ali Aujalito said the National Transitional Council and the Libyan people wanted Gadhafi to be taken alive to answer for his crimes. Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi was the only man convicted of the atrocity but it is widely accepted that he did not act alone. He was sentenced to life in prison in 2001, but was released on ‘compassionate’ grounds from Greenock jail in Renfrewshire in August 2009 after being diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer. At the time, doctors estimated he had around three months to live but he is still alive. The decision to free the bomber generated international outrage and has dogged the SNP administration ever since it was made. Last month, it was reported that Megrahi had been rushed to hospital for an emergency blood transfusion after his health ‘deteriorated quickly’. In February this year, the Crown Office said a formal request had been sent to the Libyan government requesting access to the country for police and prosecutors involved in the investigation. The Libyan National Transitional Council has previously confirmed to the UK Government that it will assist the ongoing criminal investigation, and agreed to allow officers from Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary to travel to Libya. In March Megrahi marked his 60th birthday, thanking God for the ‘miracle’ of his survival and believing he ‘has been given time to prove his innocence.’ Megrahi published his ‘death bed memoirs’ earlier this year in which he protested his innocence. Much of the book was based on evidence that was never heard, which was intended for an appeal the bomber abandoned. In the book, he claimed he was indirectly pressured by Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill to drop the appeal in exchange for repatriation to Libya. Bomber: Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi was the only man convicted of the atrocity but it is widely accepted that he did not act alone . The SNP dismissed the claim as ‘hearsay’ - but Megrahi’s family are said to be ready to launch a new appeal after his death. Megrahi’s freedom was largely due to work carried out by the Gaddafi regime and the dictator’s son, Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi, who is currently in custody in Libya. A new cancer treatment developed in London, but not yet widely available in the UK, has prolonged the bomber’s life. He has been taking Abiraterone, a £3,000-a-month hormone-based therapy drug discovered at the Institute of Cancer Research.","Details of the secret Libyan meeting only revealed a week after it was held for security reasons .

Flatpack giant Ikea has taken over from traditional John Lewis as Britain's favourite shop, an influential annual study reveals. The Swedish furniture chain has finally worked its way up to the top of the nation's affections thanks to the way it keeps its customers satisfied, said experts. And John Lewis, despite its heart-warming adverts and 'never knowingly undersold' reliability has slipped from first to third in the list from analysts Verdict Research. Flying the flag for Swedish design in the UK: Ikea has been named Brits' favourite store . Sandwiched in second place, perhaps surprisingly, is affordable womenswear chain Bonmarche which has ridden out a rollercoaster year. The store is popular with the more 'mature' woman yet has triumphed over the likes of Topshop, Next, M&S and H&M in the satisfaction rankings. Verdict's annual poll of 6,000 consumers looks at the retailers who provide what the customer wants, as well as service, quality, a wide range and good value.

'It has an extensive stylish range at attractive prices and with the majority of consumers on a tight budget, it has something for everyone.' Bonmarche's future looked in doubt when parent company Peacocks went bust but it was sold off to a private equity group who made redundancies to keep the chain alive. Hinton said: 'Bonmarche has a niche . target, the mature female shopper, but these women are well served by . the retailer, and this is reflected in its score.' Surprise hit: Women's fashion website Bonmarche shrugged off financial struggles to make it into second place .

"By . Rob Cooper . UPDATED: . 10:40 EST, 2 April 2012 . Five members of Osama Bin Laden's family have been jailed for staying in Pakistan illegally - but they will be released in just 45 days. Three of the terror leader's widows and two daughters have been held behind bars since the Al Qaeda terror leader was killed in his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan last May. The group were all living with Bin Laden when his base was raided by U.S. Navy Seals. Ladies' man: Three of Osama Bin Laden's wives, including his youngest bride Amal (right), have been jailed in Pakistan for just 45 days . Pakistani authorities formally . arrested the women on March 3 and they will serve another two weeks . behind bars before they are deported to their homelands along with the family's younger children, said their lawyer, Mohammed Amir Khalil. Two of the widows are Saudi and one is Yemeni, he said. Khalil said Yemen has consented to the woman being returned, but he is still in discussion with Saudi officials. Saudi Arabia stripped Bin Laden of his citizenship in 1994 because of his verbal attacks against the Saudi royal family. As well as being jailed, the five . women were also ordered to pay a fine of about £70 each. The lawyer does . not plan to appeal the court's ruling. Yemen-born Amal Al-Sadeh, the youngest widow, and her four children were among 16 people detained by Pakistani authorities after the raid, which also included two other wives. Pakistan was outraged by the raid on Bin Laden's compound because they were not informed it was happening beforehand. Home: Bin Laden's three wives and two daughters lived with him in the Abbottabad hideout just 200 yards from a military base which was raided last year . Going, going, gone: The compound was destroyed last year to prevent it from becoming a pilgrimage . Officials have said they had no idea . the Al Qaeda chief was in Abbottabad, something many in Washington found . hard to believe because his compound was located close to Pakistan's . equivalent of the Sandhurst military academy. The U.S. has not found any evidence indicating senior Pakistani officials knew of Bin Laden's whereabouts. But details uncovered recently from . the interrogation of his 30-year-old Yemeni wife, Amal Ahmed Abdel-Fatah . al-Sada, raised fresh questions about how Bin Laden was able to remain . undetected for so long in Pakistan after the September 11 attacks, . despite being the subject of a massive international manhunt. After leaving Afghanistan, Bin Laden . lived in five safe houses over the course of nine years while on the run . in Pakistan and fathered four children - two of them born in government . hospitals, according to al-Sada's interrogation report. Al-Sada's account says she flew to . Pakistan in 2000 and traveled to Afghanistan where she married Bin Laden . before the September 11 attacks. Safe house: Afghan refugees gather outside the house in Haripur, Pakistan, where Pakistan's intelligence agency believes Osama bin Laden lived for nearly a year until he moved into the villa where he was eventually killed . After that, the family 'scattered' and she traveled to Karachi in Pakistan. She later met up with Bin Laden . in Peshawar and then moved to the Swat Valley, where they lived in two . houses. They moved one more time before settling in Abbottabad in 2005. According to the report, al-Sada said . that two of her children were born in government hospitals, but that she . stayed only 'two or three hours' in the clinics on both occasions. The . charge sheet against the three women says that they gave officials fake . identities. Meanwhile, new pictures have emerged . which purport to show the house where Bin Laden lived for a year before . he moved to the mansion where he was killed. It's an ornate but not lavish two-storey house tucked away at the end of a mud-clogged street. This is where Pakistan's intelligence agency believes Osama bin Laden lived for nearly a year until he moved into the villa in which he was eventually killed. The residence in the frontier town of Haripur was one of five safe houses used by the slain Al Qaeda leader while on the run in Pakistan, according to information revealed by his youngest wife. Retired Pakistani Brigadier Shaukat Qadir, who has spent the last eight months tracking bin Laden's movements, said he was taken to the Haripur house last November by intelligence agents who located it from a description they got from al-Sada.","Five arrested after Bin Laden was shot dead in Pakistan compound .

The . pregnant girlfriend of one of the Toulouse gunman's victims has said she will marry her murdered . partner in a posthumous ceremony. Caroline . Monet, 21, has been given presidential permission to wed 25-year-old . Corporal Abel Chennouf, who was shot dead by Mohammed Merah at a cash machine in the town . of Montauban, near Toulouse, this month. Her lawyer, Gilbert Collard, said Ms Monet had received approval from President Nicolas Sarkozy for the ceremony to take place. Corporal Abel Chennouf, left, was shot dead by Merah. His girlfriend Caroline Money, right, has been given permission to wed him posthumously . Posthumous marriages are unusual in France, but they can be sanctioned in ‘grave circumstances’, said Mr Collard. 'I’ve already had it done twice, for policemen’s girlfriends,' he said. 'It’s a really moving ceremony with an empty chair representing the dead spouse. 'There won’t be any problems with approval, and the marriage will allow the new child to have a father.' The brother of Toulouse gunman Merah appeared before an anti-terrorist judge today and was formally charged with ‘complicity in murder’. Meanwhile the fall-out from last week's massascre has led to an escalation in religious tension, with Jewish graves being desecrated across France. Riot police have also been called to housing estates on the . outskirts of major cities like Paris because of anti-Semitic demonstrations . being held in support of the 23-year-old killer. Mohammed Mereh killed three schoolchildren, a rabbi and three paratroopers . Abdelkader Merah, the 29-year-old brother of Mohammed, appeared in court today after allegations that he was close to a Jewish school last Monday when his 23-year-old sibling gunned down a Rabbi, his two children, and a teenage pupil. He is also believed to have assisted his brother in an attack on French paratroopers, which saw three shot dead. Under conditions of utmost security in central Paris this morning, Abdelkader Merah was driven to the Palais de Justice in an armoured convoy. There a criminal investigation was opened which could see the self-confessed Islamic extremist jailed for life. In a statement read out soon afterwards, the Paris Prosecutor’s Office said: ‘The investigations being handled by the police have established the existence of serious evidence against Abdelkader Merah corroborating, or making plausible, his participation as an accomplice in the commission of crimes in connection with a terrorist enterprise.’ Abdelkader was remanded in custody, and taken to a high-security prison in Paris, where he is likely to remain until his trial. Adbelkader has already told police interrogators that he was ‘very proud’ of what Merah did, and admitted to dining with him just before the attack on the Ozar Hatorah school in Toulouse. ‘Signals from Abdelkader’s mobile phone were emitted close to the school at the time of the murders,’ said an investigating source. Among numerous questions Abedelkader . is facing is how Merah got hold of an arsenal of weapons, including an . Uzi sub-machine gun, and even the kind of Sten gun used by British . soldiers during the Second World War. It is also believed that Abdekkader . also helped his brother buy the Yamaha T-Max motorbike used in all the . attacks, and to respray the vehicle and remove its tracking device. Meanwhile, new video footage released by police shows the inside of the Toulouse apartment . where Mohammed Merah had his last stand. Suspect: Police escort Abdelkader Merah to the French police's anti-terrorist headquarters in Levallois-Perret, outside Paris on Saturday . The chaotic flat is cluttered . with furniture strewn across each room blocking the way, and one wall is . peppered in what looks like bullet holes. Merah is being held up as an martyr . in some quarters, with Jewish cemeteries targeted in attacks which . police are linking to the Merah atrocities. On Thursday night Stars of David - a . symbol of Judaism - were torn off some 30 graves in the eastern Jewish . cemetery in the Mediterranean city of Nice. Lanterns were also stolen from more . than 20 sealed tombs in the same cemetery, with local police . commissioner Hergot Nicolas saying all were targeted 'because they are . Jewish, while Christian graves nearby were ignored.' David Shoushana, the chief rabbi in . Nice, said there had been similar attacks on other cemeteries since . Merah was shot dead on Thursday, adding that there was a 'possible . connection with the Toulouse killings.' Bullet holes line the wall of the apartment of Mohamed Merah, the self-proclaimed Islamic extremist who killed seven people . Also on Thursday, graffiti including . 'Long Live Merah' and 'Vengeance!' appeared on a prominent wall in the . Paris suburb of Sartrouville as youths gathered to 'honour' the killer. 'They were mainly kids who are trying to make a political point out of these horrific crimes,' said a local police spokesman. 'Police have broken up similar . gatherings on other estates around Paris, and other cities, where Merah . is being portrayed by a tiny minority as martyr.' A teacher from Rouen, in northern . France, was also suspended after organising a minute's silence for . Merah, saying he was a 'victim' who had a difficult childhood on an . immigrant housing estate in Toulouse. Merah, who filmed himself carrying . out the executions of four Jewish people and three French soldiers who . had fought in Afghanistan, was a self-styled Jihadist. He said he wanted to kill Jewish . children in revenge for the lives of Palestinian youngsters who had died . at the hands of the Israeli army. Victims: Imad Ibn-Ziaten, 30, Abel Chennouf, 25, and Mohamed Legouade, 26 were killed by Merah last week . There are some 500,000 Jews in . France, and security measures around them have increased after Merah . shot a rabbi and three children at a school in Toulouse last Monday. There are some six million Muslims . living in France, making up the largest group of its kind in western . Europe, but Islamic leaders have rejected Merah as being utterly . unrepresentative of a largely peace-loving and law-abiding community. Mohammed Merah was gunned down by . special forces outside his council flat in Toulouse last Thursday . following a fierce firefight. Abelkader had been arrested the day . before along with his 30-year-old wife - who has not been named - and . the brothers’ divorced mother, Zoulika Aziri, 54. At one point, police brought his mother to the scene, but she refused to urge her son to surrender, officials said. Both women have now been released, . and have expressed shock at the decision to charge Adbelkader, who . denies having anything to do with his brother’s crimes. Network: 23-year-old killer Mohammed Merah, who is said to have met with UK jihadists in Afghanistan . Tragic: The mother and father of French paratrooper Imad Ben Ziaten carry a portrait of their son as they wait for his body's arrival at Rabat airport . Evidence has also emerged that Merah was in touch with British Jihadists preparing terrorist atrocities across the world. During a visit to Afghanistan just . over a year ago, Merah was using the codename ‘Youssef Toulouse’, which . was passed to the UK authorities. Paris security sources believe that . both Merah brothers were involved in two local Islamist organisations, . Forsane Alizza (The Knights of Pride) and a more militant jihadist . network known as the Toulouse group, or Jund al-Khalifah. Jund al-Khalifah, an Al-Qaeda . splinter group, has already admitted to working with a ‘Youssef the . Frenchman’ - who is believed to be Merah. ‘Not only were members of these . groups in touch with British Jidhadists while in Europe, but they would . have met them in Afghanistan,’ said one security source in the French . capital. ‘There is a window as later as 2010 when Merah would have been in touch with Jihadists from all over the world.’ 'Siege': The block of apartments in which gunman Merah was shot by police after a stand-off . The source said that Merah was known . to have entered Kabul, the Capital of Afghanistan on November 13th 2010, . after a journey across Turkey and Iraq. He was picked up by American security . agents in the Afghan city of Kandahar on November 30th , and returned . to France on December 5th 2010. The Toulouse group, which brought . together young fundamentalists of North African descent, was formed in . around 2006, with the stated aim of targeting western interests in . Europe, and sending recruits to fight in Iraq and Afghanistan. The French authorities are facing . growing criticism that Merah, a known fundamentalist who was on the U.S. no-fly list and had attended an al-Qaeda training camp, was left alone . to carry out his crimes.","Merah's brother charged over attacks after explosives found in his car .

Isaiah Nicholas repeatedly told his mother he did not want to die after being shot in the head in Houston . A four-year-old boy is in a coma after being shot in the head by a man who fired on a group of children playing. Holding his mother's hand in an ambulance after the shooting in Houston, Texas, on Saturday, Isaiah Nicholas repeatedly told her: 'Mamma, I don't want to die'. He was today said to be unconscious in a critical condition at the city's Hermann Memorial Children's Hospital, with his parents at his side. Houston Police Department said the suspect is known, but still at large. There were reports of an argument shortly before the shooting began. Lisa Ceasar, Isaiah's grandmother, said she heard arguing outside at about 5pm and walked out to her porch at the moment a man began firing, according to the Houston Chronicle. The 47-year-old said the man was aiming at the porch where she stood and a game room where six children, including Isaiah, were playing. She said: 'It all happened so fast, but I went into shock. 'I saw that man shooting up my house and the bullets flying.' Ms Ceasar ran inside and found Isaiah, her oldest grandson, with a gunshot wound to the head and his two-year-old brother, Adrian Nicholas, next to him covered in blood. The children and adults at Ms Ceasar's house in northeast Houston were just about to eat dinner, having ordered chicken. Along with three of her grandchildren, Ms Ceasar and her husband Robert were in the house as well as their daughter Rosharone Nicholas, whose friend brought her own three children. The daughter's friend reportedly left the home for quarter of an hour to go to a local shop and the suspect is said to have followed her back to the house, where an argument began. When he was first found, Isaiah's family said he was alert and able to speak, but he later slipped into a coma and was connected to a life support machine. Ms Ceasar said: 'It was so hard to see my grandbaby like that. I just pray he can pull through.' Figures released by the FBI last year showed that of 12,996 murders in the United States in 2010, more than two-thirds - 8,775 - were caused by firearms. And according to the Child Trends DataBank, an American research body, guns were used in 85 per cent of teen homicides in 2007. A wave of violence across the United States during its July 4 celebrations last year saw several youths suffer gunshot wounds, including two teenage brothers shot in Jacksonville, Florida.

Officers from Avon and Somerset Police found 130 blooming plants - worth £130,000 - by using a thermal image camera to identify heat patches under the soil in Shipham, Somerset. Drug criminals had tapped into the mains supply of a nearby house to maintain the secret cannabis hoard, using trap doors in the earth to drop into the bunker. Den: The 130 cannabis plants seized by police in Shipham, Somerset were hidden underground . The blooming haul, hidden beneath the soil, was worth around £130,000 according to police . The drugs den had lights and running water buried 10ft under the country field when it was discovered by police. Inspector Roger Tolley, from Avon and Somerset Police, said: 'We were alerted to the potential cannabis factory by the community. 'The underground factory is the latest in a rising number of cannabis factories up and down the country concealed using increasingly elaborate methods. 'In response, police are using a variety of techniques to help detect potential cannabis sites. 'The . public are our eyes and ears, and information regarding suspected . illegal activity is absolutely vital in helping us combat crime.'

An Iraq War veteran shot and killed his 11-year-old sister before turning the gun on himself in a murder-suicide on Wednesday night. Police are searching for the mother of shooter Abel Gutierrez and his sister Lucero, and fear that she may also have been killed or injured. An 11-year-old playmate of Lucero spoke of his grief at her death, saying: 'When we got the call that someone was killed, I was begging and begging that it wasn’t Lucero.' The tragic killing came just two weeks after police were called to the family's apartment in Gilroy, California but judged that Gutierrez, 27, who is thought to have suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, was not dangerous. Victims: Veteran Abel Gutierrez killed his 11-year-old sister Lucero, left, and is believed to have injured or killed his mother Martha, right . Authorities are now concentrating on the search for the killer's mother Martha Gutierrez, 52. 'It's horrible. We have no idea where she is,' Gilroy police Chad Gallacinao said. 'We are desperately trying to find her.' Police were called to the Gutierrez apartment on Wednesday night after a roommate came home, suspected something was wrong, and went back outside. Responding officers found the bodies of Gutierrez and Lucero dead from gunshot wounds. There was no sign of their mother. However, police found clues inside the home that indicated she may be seriously hurt - or worse. 'We do believe based on the evidence at the scene that she is either critically wounded or deceased,' Mr Gallacinao said. Iraq: Gutierrez is said to have developed post-traumatic stress disorder while serving in the Army (file photo) Family members told the San Jose Mercury News that Gutierrez often said that he wanted to kill himself 'all the time' and would ask if that would hurt them. A niece, Kristell Gutierrez, said she knew her uncle was 'very mean' to his mother and blamed her for his father leaving the family. Alissa Fernandez, a neighbour, told the newspaper that Gutierrez 'was just weird, the way he would act.' Tributes: Neighbours called Lucero a 'sweet little girl' and said she got on well with other local children . About two weeks ago, Martha Gutierrez apparently went to the apartment manager, saying she was 'scared of her son'. Mario Reyes, a neighbour who lives beneath the Gutierrez family, told KNTV-TV that he thought he heard a scuffle - but no gunshots - around the time police say the shooting occurred. Mr Gallacinao said officers found at least two firearms used in the killings, but he would not say whether Gutierrez left a suicide note. Abel Gutierrez served in the Army and had recently returned from Iraq. His family suspected he was suffering from PTSD, and he apparently smoked marijuana to deal with his depression. Police had been called to his apartment on February 29, but Gutierrez did not seem dangerous and did not meet the criteria to be placed on a psychiatric hold, according to Mr Gallacinao. Instead, police began working with the family and Office of Veterans Affairs in Palo Alto to help him. Gutierrez had been receiving care at a VA facility in Puget Sound, Washington, confirmed a spokesman for the Department of Veterans Affairs Care System. Friends of the family paid tribute to Lucero, who was described as a 'sweet little girl'. A woman named Emily who lives nearby told the Gilroy Dispatch the 11-year-old was 'the best little girl in the world. Her son Julian, also 11, used to play with Power Rangers with Lucero, and said he had prayed that she would be safe when he first heard about the violence. A six-year-old neighbour, Evenny, also remembered the victim happily, and said: 'We were all best friends.'","Police were called to the house two weeks earlier but decided Abel Gutierrez was not dangerous despite suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder .

Head injuries: Anthony Owen died a week after being found unconscious just 20 yards from his home . Police are continuing to question three teenagers today over the murder of a surgeon outside his millionaires' row home. Anthony Owen, 68, was found unconscious 20 yards from the property next to his white Honda Civic, which was still running. Two neighbours, in the affluent Hale Village in Widnes, Cheshire, called an ambulance and Mr Owen was taken to hospital. However, the cancer specialist is not thought to have regained consciousness, and died on Saturday. Last night, murder detectives . arrested the youths after witnesses . reported seeing three youngsters cycling away on BMX-style bikes from Mr Owen’s 1920s' thatched villa. Cheshire Police said three teenagers, aged 14, 16 and 17, all from Widnes, were arrested yesterday and remained in custody. Shocked residents described the surgeon, who was semi-retired, as a ‘pillar of the community’. A . wealthy enclave popular with the city’s professionals, the Cheshire . village is sandwiched between the town of Widnes and Liverpool’s . deprived Speke estate. Mr . Owen – who is thought to have been unmarried – was discovered at about . 10.20pm on Sunday, March 11 with head injuries. He was sprawled across . the pavement with his head lying in the road. He was taken to Walton Neurological Centre in Liverpool but later died. Police quickly ruled out the . possibility that he had been hit by a car and said they were keeping an . open mind as to whether he had fallen and hit his head. Well to do: Mr Owen's home in Hale Village, Widnes, Cheshire, where he lived alone. A witness reported seeing three youths on BMX bikes tearing away from the area minutes before his body was found . After decades of working as an oncologist, Mr Owen was still doing locum work at  Wrexham Maelor Hospital in North Wales. The devout Catholic had lived in the quiet village of Hale for more than 30 years, nursing his mother Anne, herself a retired doctor, until she died in 2003. Patricia King, who has lived next to Mr Owen for more than three decades, said he was ‘dedicated to his profession’. ‘Anthony was a dear friend and neighbour, and we will miss him dearly,’ she added. ‘He saved many lives.’ Barbara Myers, 70, whose husband Harold was treated by Mr Owen when he fell during a stroke, said: ‘He was a very good friend. ‘There have been a lot of problems in the street because we are an ageing group and Anthony was always there if he was needed. ‘I was at a party in Manchester recently and one of Anthony’s cancer patients came over to me and asked me to remember her to him. ‘She was hugely grateful to him for saving her life. He was more than just a decent bloke and the community is a lot poorer without him.’ Another neighbour, Jane Teebay, who is retired, added: ‘He was one of the most wonderful people I knew and we’re all desperately upset. He was a caring, fine, clever man.’ Mr Owen, a devout Catholic, had lived in the quiet village of Hale for more than 30 years and was well-liked by his neighbours . And Pixie Spencer, a close friend, said: ‘He was quite sociable and well-liked. People invited him to anything that went on in the road. ‘He was the last person I thought of as a pensioner because he was so active and did a lot to help people around here.’ William Stephens, 42, who runs a local website and knew Mr Owen for 11 years, paid tribute to him as an ‘eminent doctor’. ‘Whenever I was out painting the parish gates or tidying the garden he would always come over and tell me I was doing a good job,’ he said. ‘He was very pleasant and very nice. Everyone in the  village is talking about his death but nobody knows what happened.’ Witnesses have described two of the suspects as sharing a BMX-style bike. The third man was standing up as he rode a second bike. A spokesman for Cheshire Police said Mr Owen had suffered a severe head injury. She said: ‘The teenagers – aged 14, 16 and 17 who are  all from Widnes − have been arrested on suspicion of murder and are in custody helping police with their inquiries.’ She added that the attempted theft of Mr Owen's car was not currently a line of inquiry. Mr Owen’s death has echoes of the killing of Garry Newlove, who was murdered by a gang of drink-fuelled youths. The 47-year-old died two days after confronting  the gang when his wife’s car was damaged outside their home in Warrington in August 2007. Now a Tory peer, his widow has campaigned to highlight the costs of binge drinking.","Anthony Owen, 68, was found unconscious 20 yards from his home, next to his white Honda civic, which was still running .

"By . Chris Parsons . UPDATED: . 05:19 EST, 4 January 2012 . He's a man famous in South America for making outlandish predictions, but his latest declaration has involved debunking the doomsday theories of others. Mexico's 'Grand Warlock' Antonio Vazquez yesterday declared claims that Mayans have predicted the apocalypse in 2012 to be a 'big fat lie'. Mr Vazquez, who himself has previously predicted, among other things, the death of Britney Spears and a future invasion of Syria, said yesterday the Mayans never said anything about the world ending. Claim: Mexican 'Grand Warlock' Antonio Vazquez said predictions of an apocalypse based on an ancient Mayan calendar were 'big fat lies' Conspiracy theorists studying the ancient Mayan calendar had interpreted the end of the its long-count cycle in December next year as a date when the apocalypse would arrive and the world would end. The so-called long-count Mayan calendar, which spans 5,125 years starting in 3114 B.C., reaches the end of a cycle on December 21, 2012. That day signals the end of the 13th Bak'tun, an almost 400-year period in the Maya long-count calendar. The end of this period has been misunderstood to represent the end of the world, while Mexican Mr Vazquez described the apocalyptic assumption as 'big fat lies'. Rather than moving to the next Bak'tun, the long-count calendar will reset at the end of the 13th cycle in the same way a car which has traveled 99,999.9 miles resets to zero. Emiliano Gallaga Murrieta, the Chiapas state division director of Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History, told National Geographic the end of the long count simply represents the end of an old cycle and the beginning of a new one. End of an era: The event at the end of the ancient Mayan calendar in 2012 could simply be the end of a cycle rather than the apocalypse, according to experts . Mr Vazquez could not make his declaration without revealing his latest outlandish predictions, however. The Mexican has been making predictions from tarot card readings and astrology for 25 years, with somewhat mixed results. The self-appointed Grand Warlock believes witchcraft caused the rash of cancer cases among South American leaders. The film 2012 made an understated depiction of the apocalypse, but current predictions are nothing more than a misreading . Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, president of Argentina, announced on Tuesday that she was suffering from thyroid cancer, which has a high survival rate. Other South American politicians who have been struck by the disease include Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, Brazil's president Dilma Rousseff, her predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and Fernando Lugo, president of Paraguay. The . inscription describes the return of mysterious god Bolon Yokte at the . end of a 13th period of 400 years, known as Baktuns, on the equivalent . of December 21 2012. It is believed to refer to the end of a cycle of 5,125 years since the beginning of the Mayan Long Count calendar in 3113 B.C. The fragment was a prophecy of ruler Bahlam Ajaw, who wanted to plan the passage of the god. The outspoken warlock also claimed that two more Latin American leaders would contract cancer this year, before announcing that Hugo Chavez would have a 'terible relapse' of his disease in the next 12 months. Mr Vazquez has also predicted that U.S. President Barack Obama will lose the 2012 election. He also said Syria would be invaded in 2012, although he would not specify by whom. In 2008, the Mexican eccentric boldly claimed that Britney Spears would die. And . last year, although Mr Vazquez foresaw the weakening of the euro and . recession returning to developed countries, he also wrongly predicted . that a Latin American leader would be assassinated.","Antonio Vazquez debunks Mayan calendar apocalypse fears .

"By . James Tozer . UPDATED: . 19:04 EST, 31 January 2012 . A sham double wedding collapsed when one of the bogus brides was unable to identify the man she was due to marry. The registrar had become suspicious when he was asked to marry two Lithuanian women to two Indian men. His initial fears were confirmed when the couples turned up at the register office and were unable to communicate with their betrothed. Blushing brides: Lithuanian Oskana Alexsandraviciute, left, and Sandra Beleckaite, right, were both arrested at the register office when they didn't recognise their grooms or speak the same language as their betrothed . Immigration officers were called and the whole wedding party was arrested, together with the organiser who had set them up. Yesterday a court was told that Indian-born Manpreet Singh, 27, and Jasbir Singh, 21, had arranged to marry Lithuanian girls Oskana Alexsandraviciute, 27, and Sandra Beleckaite, 21 at Wrexham register office. By marrying two European residents, the Indian men would have been allowed to remain in the UK.But superintendent registrar Ruth Cooke soon realised something was wrong. As the couples waited for the ceremony, it became clear that neither bride nor groom spoke the same language and could not understand each other. Tipped off by the register office, immigration officials swooped and asked one of the Lithuanian ‘brides’ to point out her husband-to-be. When she identified the wrong man, the whole group was arrested on the spot. Mold Crown Court was told that, in an interview, the two Lithuanian women said they had been in long-standing sexual relationships with the Indian men. But when questioned later, the men told immigration officers they were chaste and had only kissed their wives-to-be on the cheek. Wyn Lloyd Jones, prosecuting, said it was clear that neither bride could understand their grooms when they arrived at the register office. ‘The grooms had little or no contact with their prospective brides,’ he said. Judge Nicolas Parry said it was a serious conspiracy aimed at cheating the immigration laws to ensure two men not entitled to remain in the UK could do so. ‘Those who enter into sham marriages to frustrate the country’s immigration controls must expect sentences that deter others,’  he said. Manpreet Singh and Jasbir Singh were jailed for 12 months and 11 months respectively while their two ‘brides’, Alexsandraviciute and Beleckaite, all from Wolverhampton, were jailed for 304 days each – meaning they walked free due to time spent on remand. Organiser Jaspal Sahota, 51, a respected community elder, was jailed for two years and two months while Lithuanian helpers Andres Stepanov, 28, and Antannas Beleckas, 27, received 16 months and 15 months respectively. Paul Abraham, defending Sahota, denied his client had received up to £7,000 for organising the scam and said he had been used by others. Dave Offside, from the UK Border Agency said: ‘The two grooms in this case saw sham marriage as a potential shortcut to a life in the UK, but they have ended up behind bars. ‘The brides were prepared to marry people they barely know in exchange for cash and the others involved also stood to gain financially.’ The Indian men will be deported when they have served their sentences.","The registrar first became suspicious when he was ask to marry two Lithuanian women to two Indian men .

The first witness to encounter honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani after his wife was abducted at gunpoint has told how he believes the British businessman is innocent. Simbonile Matokazi encountered Dewani, 32, on the outskirts of Cape Town minutes after the Briton claimed he was ejected from a taxi by armed hijackers who had sped off with his new bride Anni still inside. Dewani will learn tomorrow whether he has won his High Court appeal against an order that he can be extradited to South Africa to face allegations of masterminding his wife’s murder during their honeymoon. Caught on film: CCTV footage to be broadcast tonight on Panorama appears to show to show Dewani handing cash to the taxi driver Dewani allegedly paid in return for orchestrating his wife's killing . At the hotel: Carrying a bag, Shrien is followed by Zola Tongo - who has been jailed for organising the murder . The care home owner from Bristol has always strenuously denied any involvement in the killing of Mrs Dewani, 28, in Cape Town in November 2010. Mr Matokazi told a Panorama documentary to be aired tonight he thought Dewani was 'genuine' when he told him the hijacking story when the pair met.

Recalling his encounter with a shell-shocked Dewani in the Gugulethu township on the outskirts of Cape Town, Mr Matokazi, a local government auditor, told Panorama: 'I don’t think this guy had killed his wife.' First witness: Simbonile Matokazi found Shrien Dewani after the robbery and subsequent murder of the latter's wife . He added: 'When I found out that he was accused I was a bit surprised, because when he told me his story that night I believed him and I thought what he was saying was the truth. And it was genuine.' Mrs Dewani, from Sweden, was later found dead in the back of the abandoned cab with a bullet wound to her neck. Taxi driver Zola Tongo, who has admitted his part in the crime, claimed in a plea agreement with prosecutors that Dewani ordered the carjacking and paid for a hit on his wife. William Booth, chairman of the South African Law Society’s criminal law committee, raises concerns in the documentary about the way cases are investigated before they come to court in South Africa. He told Panorama: 'The South African authorities are paying so much attention to the Dewani case to show the rest of the world that they are doing something about crime in South Africa. That is a big factor in this case.' The Dewani family’s lawyer, Charlotte . Harris, of Mishcon de Reya, said in a statement: 'Shrien has not been . charged with any offence in any country. 'Despite . his offers at an early stage he has not been interviewed by the South . African authorities in connection with any offence. Tongo later leaves with the bag. He claims the bag contained 1,000 South African rand (about £82) in cash which was his payment for arranging the murder . Previously unseen: The footage was recorded three days after Anni was shot dead . Together: Shrien Dewani, pictured with Anni, has strictly denied any involvement in her murder . 'Shrien is innocent and has always maintained his commitment to clearing his name of all the false allegations and slurs against him. He remains determined to fight for justice for his wife, Anni.

Former world darts champion John ‘Jocky’ Wilson was hailed as the ‘Braveheart’ of the game yesterday following his death at  the age of 62. A star of the golden era of darts, famed for downing lager with vodka chasers during matches, he died at his home in Kirkcaldy, Fife, after a battle with lung disease. Tommy Cox, who managed Wilson from 1988-1996, paid tribute to the man who helped lay the foundations of the modern game. Darts legend Jocky Wilson, pictured here at the World Professional Darts Championship in 1983, died after losing his battle with a lung disorder . He said: ‘In the 1980s there wasn’t a person in the country who didn’t know who Jocky Wilson was. ‘Jocky transcended the whole spectrum . of life in the UK. It’s a very sad day because Jocky was loved by so . many people for the great character he was.’ English player and former rival Bobby . George said Wilson was ‘the Braveheart of darts’. Glory: Wilson twice won the world darts title, securing wins in 1982 and 1989 . He added: ‘He was . Scottish through and through. When he played against England, it was . great for the Scots.’ Wilson, who retired in 1996, leaves behind a wife and three children . Wilson, who won world titles in 1982 . and 1989, founded a breakaway professional darts championship in the . 1990s which helped the sport shed its working-class image and attract a . new generation of fans. Prince Harry is known to enjoy the game and went to London’s Alexandra Palace last year for the World Darts Championship. Phil ‘The Power’ Taylor, the 15-time . world champion, said: ‘With the likes of Eric  Bristow and John Lowe, . Jocky made the game what it is today.’ Wilson, born in Kirkcaldy, was to many, the quintessential darts player, playing with a cigarette in one hand and drinking. He earned £500 for winning his first . major competition when he was 29 and unemployed. By the end of that year . he was in the top eight in the world. Such was his cult status that he . famously made a ‘guest appearance’ on Top of the Pops in 1982 when Dexys .

Legends: Wilson with fellow darts player Bobby George (right) in 1982 . Wilson retired suddenly from darts . when he was 45. Leaving his home in Newcastle, he moved back to . Kirkcaldy and into a one-bedroom council flat. It is believed that he walked away from the game he loved after being diagnosed with diabetes, which stopped him from drinking during the games.

It is thought he spent the last 16 years of his life as a recluse, never even setting foot outside his home again. He died two days after his 62nd birthday at the home he shared . with his Argentinian wife Malvina. They had three children.

If you've got an old painting gathering dust in the attic, now is the time to get it down to an auction house. While Austerity Britain languishes in the doldrums, with rising inflation and low wage increases, the art market is one sector that is booming. And figures released by Sotheby's in London show that the auction house sold almost £1billion of fine art in 2011, according to Companies House - one of the best financial results in its 268-year history. Big sellers at Sotheby's in London last year included Pablo Picasso's La Lecture, which went for £25.2million . Francesco Guardi's Venice, A View Of The Rialto Bridge, Looking North, From The Fondamenta Del Carbon, sold for £26.7million. It was the biggest seller of the year for Sotheby's, which recorded bumper billion-pound sales . Total sales at Sotheby's, based in New Bond Street, reached £930million, about £50million more than in 2010. Last year, global art sales topped nearly £36billion - with the UK taking a sizeable chunk. Francesco Guardi's Venice, A View Of The Rialto Bridge, Looking North, From The Fondamenta Del Carbon, sold for £26.7million. Culture Minister Ed Vaizey slapped an export ban on it in October to allow time for someone to come up with the money to keep the painting in Britain. Other big sellers included Pablo . Picasso's La Lecture, which went for £25.2million and Salvador Dali's . Portrait De Paul Eluard, which fetched £13.5million. Salvador Dali's Portrait De Paul Eluard, which fetched £13.5million .

Egon Schiele's House With Laundry (Suburb II) - a rare 1914 suburban townscape - yielded £24.6million. Bill Ruprecht, the company's president and CEO, said: 'Sotheby’s had great success last year, handling masterpieces, innovating in new markets and building trust based relationships with clients globally and our 2011 financial results reflected those efforts. 'They are near the best we have ever delivered.' Further highlights from last year included Francis Bacon's Three Studies For A Portrait Of Lucian Freud which reached £23million. It came from a private collection which itself broke records when it fetched £93.5million. London Sotheby's results are all the more impressive given that it has to contend with rivals such as Christie's and Bonhams as well as sister houses internationally. Further highlights from last year included Francis Bacon's Three Studies For A Portrait Of Lucian Freud which reached £23million . Mr Ruprecht told the Independent: 'We have now reached the point where the three geographic engines driving our auction business - the Americas, Europe and Asia - are contributing to our success in roughly equal proportions.' Upcoming sales which will no doubt boost the firm's coffers include Edvard Munch's The Scream, which could reach £50.5million when it goes to auction in New York - along with an Andy Warhol portrait of Elvis, expected to fetch £30million. Meanwhile, another Warhol - a screen print of portrait of Brigitte Bardot - will be up for sale in London in May as part of a 300-work collection once owned by German industrialist Gunter Sachs.

A top member of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was killed in an air strike over the weekend, the Yemeni Embassy confirmed Tuesday. U.S. officials say the strike was conducted by the CIA and killed Mohammed Al-Umda on Sunday. The drone targeted the prominent Al-Qaeda leader while he was riding in his SUV. Killed: Wanted Al-Qaeda leader Mohammed Saeed al-Umda was killed by a CIA-operated Predator drone like this one (file photo) Meeting: Yemeni President Abdo Rabbo Mansour Hadi, right, talked with the director of the FBI, Robert Mueller, left, during a meeting in Yemen Tuesday in which Mr Mueller pledged support against Islamist insurgency . According to ABC News, the CIA and the . US military’s Joint Special Operations Command fly drones over that area . of the Middle East to target possible insurgents. FBI director Robert Mueller visited Yemen on Tuesday, pledging to help quell an Islamist insurgency, as security and government sources said a drone had killed a prominent al Qaeda leader linked to an attack on a French oil tanker. In a meeting with President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who took office earlier this year, Mueller promised the United States would support Yemen 'with full force' in all respects. 'Mueller visits Yemen on an annual basis so this is not a special or secret occasion,' said Mohammed Al-Basha, Yemen's embassy spokesman in Washington. 'President Hadi emphasised that he is strongly committed to combating extremism and working with the U.S. to counter the mutual threat of terrorism.' Yemen's embassy in Washington said on Tuesday that Mohammed Saeed al-Umda, convicted in 2005 of involvement in the 2002 attack on the Limburg oil tanker, had been killed in an air strike on his convoy in the oil-producing province of Maarib on Sunday. Umda, described by the embassy as Yemen's fourth most-wanted man, had received military training under Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan and was in charge of the group's finances, a security source said. Embattled: A female supporter of Yemen's former President Ali Abdullah Saleh wears pins with his pictures as she demonstrates outside the Cabinet building to demand an investigation into the assassination attempt on Saleh last year . In Washington, U.S. officials indicated that there had been other similar air attacks recently against militant targets in Yemen. U.S. cooperation with Yemeni authorities on counter-terrorism issues appears to have improved somewhat since Hadi took over from long-time president Ali Abdullah Saleh earlier this year. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were aware of reports of al-Umda's death in such an attack but did not have final confirmation. U.S. sources indicated that the airstrike in which the Yemenis say he was killed was carried out by a missile fired from a CIA-operated drone aircraft.The U.S. has repeatedly used drones to target suspected Al-Qaeda militants, who have been emboldened by a year of political upheaval in the impoverished state. Exploiting mass protests against former president Saleh's 33 years in office, militants linked to al Qaeda last year seized large swathes of territory in southern Yemen, including at least two towns. Yemen's army, which split into two factions during the uprising that eventually unseated Saleh, has been battling to get the upper hand against the militants. Escalating violence: According to media reports, a car bomb attack targeted a Yemeni security commander in Lahj province Tuesday, causing the injuries to the commander and other two people . On Tuesday, the Defence Ministry put the number of militants killed in the southern Abyan province in the past two days at 52. It said the army had seized some government offices from militants as they pushed deep inside the provincial capital of Zinjibar. In a statement, Ansar al-Sharia, an al Qaeda-affiliated group, said its fighters had blocked the army's advance and challenged the authorities to issue 'just one recent photograph showing troops inside the city (Zinjibar)'. The statement did not refer to the drone attack. Tribal sources in Abyan said up to 21 militants were killed in three separate clashes with pro-government tribesmen on Tuesday. Two tribal fighters died in the fighting, they said. President Hadi is trying to reform the army but has run up against the vested interests of Saleh's relatives and allies still in charge of the military and security establishment. In a modest victory for Hadi, Mohammed Saleh al-Ahmar, a half-brother of Saleh, left his post as air force commander on Tuesday. Earlier this month, he shut down the capital's airport and grounded all flights to protest against his removal in a direct challenge to Hadi's authority. 'The handover has taken place as stated in the decree issued by the president,' U.N. envoy Jamal Benomar told reporters in Sanaa. 'It was a smooth handover with no conditions whatsoever.' It was the first time Hadi had succeeded in removing one of Saleh's relatives from power. Saleh's son, nephew and other allies remain in place as heads of military units. Benomar, who helped push through the plan under which Saleh left office after more than a year of popular unrest, persuaded the former president to lean on his half-brother to step aside, a government official said on condition of anonymity. General Rashed Ali Nasser al-Jund becomes head of the air force. Ahmar was appointed an assistant to the defence minister.","Mohammed Al-Umda, trained by Bin Laden, was killed in weekend strike .

The revelation plunged the U.S. investment bank into fresh embarrassment over its business ethics weeks after a former executive claimed bosses there called clients ‘muppets’. It has emerged that a private equity fund run by the bank had taken a major stake in a  secretive company called Village Voice Media. It owns a classified advertising website – Backpage.com – that is accused of being the biggest forum for illegal sex trafficking of underage girls in America. Headquarters: Goldman Sachs, which owns GS Capital Partners III, has signed a deal to sell its 16 per cent stake in Village Voice Media, which owns the website, called Backpage.com . GS Capital Partners III said it had . agreed to sell its 16 per cent stake in the media company, admitting it . had lost much of its investment in the process. Goldman Sachs insisted . it had grown ‘uncomfortable with the direction of the company’ and its . inability to influence its direction. However New York Times columnist . Nicholas Kristof, who exposed the connection, said the bank had been . ‘mortified’ when he first inquired about its stake last week and ‘began . working frantically to unload its shares’. Backpage.com is estimated to have a . nearly 80 per cent share  of online prostitution advertising in the . U.S., worth some £2.5million a month. It also hosts advertising forums in at least a dozen other countries including the UK. Stake: A Goldman Sachas spokesman said the fund invested $30million in the Village Voice in 2000 . In Britain, it is used by hundreds of . prostitutes across 19 cities and regions, ranging from Devon and . Hampshire to Sheffield and Aberdeen. Pimps reportedly use the website to . peddle underage girls, using euphemisms such as ‘petite’ to provide . potential clients with a clue to their real age. There have been growing calls  in the U.S. for the owners of  Backpage to drop the ‘adult’  classified section. Critics including prosecutors, . politicians and religious leaders say many of the adverts for so-called . escorts are soliciting sex with children, who are sometimes substituted . at the point of sale for the adults who have been pictured. But anti-sex trafficking campaigners . have been hampered in their efforts because Village Voice Media is . privately owned and doesn’t have to reveal its owners. Goldman Sachs invested £19million in . Village Voice, an alternative New York newspaper, in 2000 and the stake . was converted into a 16 per cent minority stake when the publication . merged with another media company, New Times Inc, in 2006. Since then a Goldman managing director, Scott Lebovitz, has had a seat on the board of the new company. Village Voice Media has rejected . demands to close down its adult adverts section, insisting the . advertising would simply move offshore and outside the jurisdiction of . U.S. authorities. The company said it was co-operating . with investigators and had reported 2,695 cases of suspected child . trafficking to officials in 2011. Goldman Sachs – once memorably . described as a ‘great vampire squid’ sucking up money from wherever it . could – has an unenviable reputation as one of the banking world’s . greediest players. That image was reinforced last month . when Greg Smith, a Goldman Sachs executive director, resigned with a . stinging attack on its ‘toxic and destructive’ culture. Controversy: Nearly 80 per cent of the $3.1million revenue earned from online prostitution advertising has been attributed to Backpage.com by classified advertising consultant AIM Group . Protest: John Buffalo Mailer, right, whose late father, Norman Mailer, co-founded the Village Voice, demands it stop running sex ads of minors at a rally on Thursday . He said the bank regularly put its own . financial interests before those of its clients, whom bank bosses . frequently dismissed as ‘muppets’. Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd . Blankfein claimed in 2009 that bankers were doing ‘God’s work’. He was . speaking after the bank had provoked anger by revealing it planned to . lavish a record £13.4billion in pay and bonuses on its staff. Defending the move just 12 months . after bankers brought the world’s economy to the brink of collapse, Mr . Blankfein said modern banking performed a vital function and described . himself as just a banker ‘doing God’s work’. ‘We’re very important,’ he said. ‘We help companies to grow by helping them to raise capital. ‘Companies that grow create wealth. This, in turn, allows people to have jobs that create more growth and . more wealth. We have a social purpose.’",Revelation plunges U.S. investment bank into fresh embarrassment .

The lead detective investigating Trayvon Martin's death said his killer should have been arrested, but was told there would not be enough evidence to successfully prosecute. Chris Serino, of Florida's Sanford Police Department, said he believed George Zimmerman should be charged with manslaughter for the February shooting of the unarmed 17-year-old in a gated community. But the local state attorney overruled him, saying there was not enough evidence to convict him of the crime, which carries a maximum 15-year sentence. Scroll down for appeal video from R&B singer Chaka Kahn . Dispute: The lead detective on the case believed George Zimmerman, . right, should be arrested for manslaughter in the killing of Trayvon . Martin (left) Speaking out: Trayvon's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, talked about their son's death at a public forum sponsored by Democrats on Capitol Hill . ABC News made the startling revelation, citing anonymous sources who leaked information about the initial hours of the investigation of the shooting. If true, it shows that not all law enforcement officers agreed that Zimmerman should go free after he invoked Florida's Stand Your Ground law and claimed to have killed the teen in self-defence. The fact that Zimmerman was never arrested has sparked outrage across the country and roiled race relations. Tens of thousands of protesters across the country have marched at rallies supporting Trayvon. Zimmerman told police he was approached and 'sucker-punched' by Trayvon on February 26 after he followed the boy returning home to his father's home. New picture: This image taken from a Twitter account that reportedly belonged to Trayvon, shows an older image of the teen - just as new reporting is casting a different light on his behaviour . Protests: The killing of Trayvon Martin has sparked numerous demonstrations across the country, like this one in front of the White House on Tuesday . He said after Trayvon knocked Zimmerman to the ground, breaking his nose, the teen jumped on top of him and bashed his head against the sidewalk several times. But apparently Mr Serino did not entirely buy Zimmerman's version of events. Zimmerman's lawyer said police took him to the station house and questioned him for several hours the night of the shooting, despite his request to go to the hospital. One likely source of the state attorney's reluctance to charge Zimmerman is the controversial Stand Your Ground law in Florida. It allows anyone to use deadly force to defend themselves if they have a reasonable belief that they are about to be killed or severely injured. Justice for Trayvon: Trayvon Martin's parents, centre, are led out of a House Judiciary Committee by Rep Frederica Wilson (left) and Rep Sheila Jackson-Lee (right) Reforms: Darren Scott, acting Police Chief for Sanford, FLorida, took questions at a press conference announcing a plan to hire outside oversight for the department . 'The Stand Your Ground law is one portion of justifiable use of deadly force,'  top prosecutor Angela Corey told ABC News. The Daily Caller, a conservative news site, has published 152 pages of tweets it says were copied from Trayvon Martin's Twitter account before it was taken down.Here is a small sample of the messages by a user with the handle '@NO_LIMIT_N***A' sent and received in the months before Trayvon's death:    (From a cousin): Yu ain't tell me yu swung on a bus driver    PLZZ EXERCISE YO RIGHT 2 REMAIN SILENT..

No skool 2maro >>>>>>>>>> . 'And what that means is that the state . must go forward and be able to prove it's case beyond a reasonable . doubt... So it makes the case in general more difficult than a normal . criminal case.' Yesterday, Martin's parents spoke briefly before a Democrats-only congressional panel as cameras clicked noisily in front of them. Many in the crowd, which filled the seats and lined the walls, strained to catch a glimpse of them. 'Trayvon was our son, but Trayvon is your son,' Sybrina Fulton, Martin's mother, told the panel. 'A lot of people can relate to our situation and it breaks their heart like it breaks our heart.' Martin's father, Tracy Martin, thanked 'everyone who is holding the legacy of Trayvon.' 'Trayvon is sadly missed and we will continue to fight for justice for him,' he said. During the two-hour forum, the lawmakers and witnesses openly criticized the police investigation of the shooting and the failure of police to arrest the admitted shooter, George Zimmerman. Earlier in the day, House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, said 'clearly what happened is in fact a tragedy.' But he steered clear of calling for Zimmerman's arrest as some lawmakers have done.  'It's being investigated by state and federal officials, which I think is appropriate,' said Boehner. The development's came days after new details emerged about Zimmerman's criminal past. In . July 2005, the then 21-year-old was arrested at a university bar when . he became involved in a scuffle with state alcohol agents. As . one of his friends was being arrested for serving underage drinkers, . Zimmerman started becoming verbally abusive and pushed an agent. He was arrested after a scuffle ensued but avoided conviction by entering a pretrial-diversion programme. A month later, court records show, a woman filed a petition for an injunction against Zimmerman, citing domestic violence. Records show injunctions were later issued in both cases. In 2006 he was charged with speeding, but the case was dismissed when the prosecuting officer failed to show up in court. And in 2008 he was pursued for a number of unpaid credit card debts which were eventually resolved.

"Distressed toddler's cries heard from outside house . Mother did not know 'baby-sitter's' full name or address . By . Helen Collis . PUBLISHED: . 11:01 EST, 21 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:12 EST, 21 April 2012 . Nicola Lewington, 24, of Mottingham, Bromley, south London spent the night behind bars while her daughter was home alone. A mother arrested during August’s riots admitted leaving her two-year-old daughter alone overnight while she was held by police. Nicola Lewington, 24, of Mottingham, Bromley, south London spent the night behind bars while her daughter was home alone. Two-year-old Tiana was found the next day by Lewington’s mother when she visited the house to receive an Argos delivery. Thea Viney, prosecuting, said: 'She could hear her whimpering and crying inside and went to collect her keys. 'She let herself in and found Tiana, who was two years old at the time, standing at the top of the stairs, crying, distressed, with a soiled nappy, asking for her mother.' Lewington pleaded guilty to child neglect, though says she left her at home with a friend called Becky. Bromley Magistrates’ Court heard Lewington had put Tiana to bed on August 9 and had gone out to buy a takeaway, leaving her friend Becky to look after her. While she was out she met friends and drove to Orpington, where she was arrested with four other people at 1am after police found items they believed had been stolen during the riots in her car. She was then taken to Bromley Police Station where she told officers she had a child but she was being looked after - but did not know Becky’s full name, phone number or where she lived. Riots: Across the country protestors took to the streets last August. The riots saw buildings and vehicles set alight and shops looted as police in riot gear faced angry mobs . Ms Viney added: 'She left Tiana in the care of Becky and now accepts that led her to be reckless as to the child’s safety given how little she knew about who was caring for her.' James McCooey, mitigating, said: 'She was not a woman packing her bags and going on holiday. 'She would have been home if not for the fact she had been arrested.' He added it was out of character and she had been described by friends as a 'very loving mother'. Magistrate Geraldine Mushett sentenced Lewington to an 18-month community order with a supervision requirement and she must take part in an intervention programme for women offenders, as well as pay costs of £85. Lewington was cleared of the burglary charges for which she was arrested on December 20.","Distressed toddler's cries heard from outside house .

A ceremony to be held tomorrow will come 70 years to the day after the bombing raid over Tokyo led by Lt. Col. 'Jimmy' Doolittle that helped change the course of World War II. Five men – the last alive of the original Doolittle’s Raiders – will help remember the dead by reading the 75 names engraved on silver goblets. When the ceremony begins, the jovial banter and storytelling will halt, and guests will be ushered out of the meeting room, the door shutting behind them. Taking the skies: A B-25 bomber trailed by another and a Japanese Zero makes it's landing approach at Wright Patterson Air Force base in Dayton . Celebrations past: The survivors of the raid gathered in 2010 as well to remember those who had passed, standing in front of a B-25 bomber . Preparations: A ground crewman walks off after chocking the wheels of 'Betty's Dream.' The bomber is one of twenty of the WW-II era B-25's that flew in for the 70th anniversary of the Doolittle raid on Tokyo . The five men, all in their 90s, will come to military-erect attention. Before them will be a wooden display case with 80 silver goblets. On each, a name is engraved twice: to be read right-side-up - for those still alive - or to be read placed upside-down, in memory of the 75 now dead. 'To those who have gone,' 96-year-old Lt. Col. Richard Cole will toast, raising his goblet high.The other four surviving Doolittle's Raiders - Maj. Thomas Griffin, Lt. Col. Robert Hite, Lt. Col. Edward Saylor and Master Sgt. David Thatcher - will answer in unison: 'To those who have gone.' Four days of celebration are planned April 17-20 at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force near Dayton, Ohio, including a fly-in of B-25 bombers like they flew. The raid took place April 18, 1942. Descent: The B-25 bomber 'Panchito' lands at the base; the daring bombing raid is credited with giving Americans a big morale boost in the Pearl Harbor aftermath . Lined up: Twenty B-25 bombers line up on a runway at Wright Patterson Air Force base . Next generation: Kristi Lesko, left, flight engineer for the Barbie II and Devil Dog pilot Beth Jenkins pose with the B-25 bomber . Special guests include survivors or relatives of the USS Hornet aircraft carrier crew that launched them and of Chinese villagers who helped save them after the raid. Fearless leader: The raid was led by Lt Col James 'Jimmy' Doolittle . The toast ritual grew from early get-togethers led by Doolittle, who died in 1993. 'It is a very private moment,' said Cole, a Dayton native who lives in Comfort, Texas. 'You remember the ones who didn't make it, you think about them, and you are sorry they aren't with us. And then the ones fortunate to still be living trade off stories.' The stories are many, their bond forged in a daring mission. 'I didn't expect to survive. We should have been shot down,' said Saylor, 92, a Brusett, Montana, native who lives in Puyallup, Washington. Pilots volunteered and trained in Florida for what they only knew was 'extremely hazardous.' Navigator Griffin, from Green Bay, Wisconsin, got top-secret briefings with pilot David Jones in Washington, just five months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour. 'We needed to hit back,' recalled Griffin, now 95 and living near Cincinnati. Once at sea, the rest learned targets - factories, plants, military facilities on mainland Japan. They knew the uncertainties: what if the Navy task force was attacked? What defences would they face? And with B-25s unable to land on a carrier decks, could they reach friendly bases in China? 'We didn't know we were supposed to be afraid,' summarized Saylor, 22 then. The Raiders brushed aside Doolittle's assurances that anyone was free to withdraw. Belly of the beast: Crew members Matt Bongers, left, and Tim Reynolds unload supplies from the bomb bay of the B-25 Devil Dog . Sky high: The crew of the B-25 Executive Sweet take photographs from atop their WW-II bombers . 'It was a mission in the war. We did what we were required to do,' said Thatcher, of Missoula, Montana, age 90. After encountering Japanese patrols, the raid launched ahead of plan, some 200 miles farther from shore for fuel-stretched bombers. Doolittle's plane took off first at 08:20 from a pitching carrier deck. 'It's the Charge of the Light Brigade,' said historian Hugh Ambrose. 'They know that a betting man would probably bet against them ... brave heroism in the face of an enemy that at that time was winning the war.' They flew low in radio silence, skimming seas and then treetops. Cole recalls the country song 'Wabash Cannonball' running through his head. He tapped his foot in time until Doolittle shot him a questioning look. Before the attack: Orders in his hand, Capt. Marc A. Mitscher, skipper of the U.S.S. Hornet, discusses details for the take-off of Army members for the Tokyo raid with Maj. Gen. James H. Doolittle, foreground left . Off to battle: A B25 takes off from the USS Hornet on April 18, 1942 to complete the daring attack . Ushering: A man directs on of the planes before the mission . Legions: Several bombers wait on the deck of the aircraft carrier, awaiting departure . They were greeted by anti-aircraft guns and puffs of black smoke. Flak shook planes. 'As . we got there, there was no conversation, until the bombardier told Col. Doolittle that the initial bombing target was in sight,' said Cole, who . was in the lead plane. 'At that point, Col. Doolittle said to open up . the bomb bay doors.' The bombs dropped, 'and we got the heck out of there.' 'It is a very private moment. You remember the ones who . didn't make it, you think about them, and you are sorry they aren't . with us. And then the ones fortunate to still be living trade off . stories.' -Lt Col Richard Cole . The danger was just beginning. All 16 planes lacked enough fuel to reach bases and either crash-landed or ditched in dark, rough weather along China's coast south of Shanghai. 'The most scary time for me was standing in a plane at 9,000 feet, in the middle of a pretty bad storm, looking down into a black hole and ready to exit into the unknown,' said Cole. 'I never learned how to swim,' added a chuckling Saylor, who held onto a damaged raft. 'I was raised on a cattle ranch out in Montana.' Thatcher was aboard the plane dubbed 'The Ruptured Duck,' which crash-landed into water. Pilot Ted Lawson's leg was badly broken, later amputated. They narrowly stayed ahead of Japanese searchers, who killed villagers suspected of helping the Americans. 'We had a lot of near-misses, when they raided places we had been the night before,' said Griffin, now 95 and living near Cincinnati. Aftermath: The servicemen managed to sink the Nitt¿ Maru, a Japanese patrol craft . Eight Raiders were captured, and three executed. A fourth died in captivity. Three had died off the coast of China. 'The Chinese people were of immeasurable help to us,' Cole reflected. 'If it hadn't been for them, I wouldn't be alive today to tell you about this.' Although the Tokyo raid inflicted light damage compared to Pearl Harbour, it shook Japanese confidence and uplifted Americans, said Ambrose, author of 'The Pacific.' 'It was a symbolic act,' he said. 'It did wonders for the American people. It was just the sort of calling card that let people understand that ... yes, we're going to do it.' Surviving Raiders got new assignments. Ten more would die in the war. The Raiders' post-war gatherings have become popular drawing cards for museums, air bases and other locales. 'Young people, parents and their grandparents are there to meet these gentlemen and hear their stories first-hand,' Ambrose said. 'It's a chance to experience living history ... It becomes a part of us.' Hite, 92, who survived Japanese captivity, had recent health issues, but the Odell, Texas, native and Nashville, Tennessee, resident is expected to attend and join the toast. 'It's going to be special,' said Griffin. 'I can't help but think it's going to be our last big one.' Six years ago, there were still 16 survivors. By plan, the last two Raiders living will someday make the final toast. They will sip from cognac vintage 1896 - the year Doolittle was born.

Phoebe McInally was left with a large bald patch and serious bite marks across her back after being attacked by the savage animal. The girl's mother Lucy, 32, could only watch in horror as the out-of-control South African Boerboel dog then turned and attacked Phoebe's five-year-old sister Alix. Mauling: Phoebe McInally, 3, was left with a large bald patch, left, and bite marks across her back, right, following the savage attack in a park in Blantyre, Lanarkshire . Attack: A South African Boerboel like the one which bit Phoebe McInally and her sister . The family were walking through a park in Blantyre, Lanarkshire, as they were set upon by the animal. The dog - a rare type of Mastiff - only halted its attack when Lucy kicked it so many times it fled. Lucy, from Rutherglen, Lanarkshire said she believes Phoebe would have died if she was not wearing a thick winter coat. The sisters were taken to Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride where they were treated for their injuries and given antibiotics. Both girls have been left traumatised by the incident and are now too scared to go outside and are suffering from nightmares. They also need medicine for pain relief.

Strathclyde Police were called to the incident and a 39-year-old woman has now been reported to the procurator fiscal. The dog has since been destroyed. Today Lucy, a typist, called for pet owners to keep closer control of their animals. She said: 'The dog wasn't on a lead and was just too strong for us.

But in an unlikely twist one estate agent has celebrated its faults and described a property as ‘shabby’, ‘tatty’ and in ‘dire need of updating’. In a 'warts and all' advert Mike Rogerson Estate Agents say the £275,000 property in Morpeth, Northumberland, requires 'blood, sweat and tears' to make it habitable and incredibly the seller has encouraged the decision. The four-bed terrace is described as cracked, crumbling, dodgy and from a previous century but the agent believes, despite the gloomy picture it paints, this decision is sure to make it sell. For sale: It may be shabby, tatty and in dire need of updating but an estate agent says the honest approach will help it sell . They say there has been plenty of interest in the house already. 'The property itself has a rather shabby exterior which is compounded immediately upon entering the property by a matching disregard to what may be generally considered habitable,' the advert says. 'And being untouched by the 21st Century, will require blood, sweat and tears to haul it anywhere back to modern tastes. Cracked: The property needs new ceilings and 'blood, sweat and tears' to make it habitable . Torn: The carpets throughout, including here on the stairs needs replacing and the seller has embraced the honest approach to the home's flaws . 'Looking unremarkable from the outside, it deserves further investigation from the monumental masonry cracks as soon as you open the door, to the crumbling handrail and dodgy stone steps leading to the garage and small garden. 'A cavernous basement houses a newish combi boiler and water meter. 'The north-facing windows have been paint stuck for years, including one over the archway which is open to the elements.' Stephanie Burn, who is selling the house, said she had been inspired by a London estate agent, Roy Brooks, who was famed for his candid housing brochures in the 1970s. Uninhabitable: The property in Morpeth, Northumberland, is in 'dire need of updating' 'You knew when you were going into that house that it was going to be a project,' the 73-year-old said. 'It’s all about honesty, really. That’s what people want.' Estate agent Mike Rogerson said: 'The vendor was quite insistent that she wanted it to be warts and all. 'She had been disappointed by properties that she had visited in the past and  she realised the property has some problems but has a fantastic characterful identity underneath for someone with a bit of imagination to turn it into a  family home. 'We have been amazed by the feedback from people. Most people have said things like, how refreshing, and by the way we’d love to come and see it’. 'It was a bit of fun and a bit sarcastic but if vendors want it done in this way we’re more than happy to do it.” Louise Wilkinson, the manager of the Morpeth branch, said the advert had been  well received and had generated lots of interest. 'We’ve had phone calls from all over with people asking us if we were aware that it was live on our system,' she said. 'But it was written purposely in this way and there is an offer on the property. 'It was a suggestion from the vendor that it was written in this manner. 'She was inspired by the estate agent from the 1960s that used to detail properties in this manner and she had done a lot of research into this.'","Owner Stephanie Burn says she wanted to be honest about the 'crumbling' house in Morpeth, Northumberland .

Children could be taught in football stadiums, bingo halls and even a former Woolworths store by 2015 as a baby boom and immigration put pressure on primary schools. At least 454,571 additional places in primaries will be required in England within three years. This equates to 2,030 extra schools, with an average intake of 224 pupils. At least 454,571 additional places in primaries will be required in England within three years . Councils are scouring empty buildings to house lessons as they struggle to accommodate the influx of pupils. The estimates – based on Department for Education figures following a survey of 151 local authorities – were released yesterday by Labour’s education spokesman Stephen Twigg. He said the Coalition must use the Budget to tackle the issue. The Tories and Liberal Democrats have previously accused the former Labour Government of failing to prepare sufficiently for the looming admissions crisis. Education Secretary Michael Gove said the last government ignored warnings of a baby boom as early as 2004 . The worst affected areas include Lancashire, which needs almost 14,000 extra primary places by 2015; Birmingham, Leeds, Hertfordshire and Hampshire, which all require more than 11,000, and Kent, Manchester and Essex, which need more than 9,000. Across London, an additional 100,000 primary places are needed by 2015. In Barking and Dagenham, where more than 8,000 extra primary places are required, the council is proposing to rent out a former Woolworths store and a warehouse from MFI to house temporary classes. Officials in East Sussex are considering teaching pupils in Brighton and Hove Albion FC’s football stadium, a bingo hall or in redundant churches due to a shortage of school places. And at Ladybarn Primary School in Manchester, a surge in numbers means pupils have to eat their lunch in five different shifts, with the first wave sitting down to eat at 11.15am. The dining hall is too small to accommodate all 400 pupils at once. Tens of thousands of children are already being squeezed into overcrowded schools, with one in five primaries at bursting point. Some 3,428 were classified as ‘full or had pupils in excess of school capacity’ in May last year. Councils are scouring empty buildings to house lessons as they struggle to accommodate the influx of pupils . Up to half of primary schools in Brighton and Hove, and Bromley in South East London, were at bursting point. And out of 41 primary schools in Sutton, South London, 26 were full or had excess numbers of pupils.  Mr Twigg yesterday accused the Government of being ‘oblivious’ to the problem and ‘preferring to focus on pet projects’ such as free schools. He said: ‘The Government needs to address this head on in the budget – allocating all its education capital to meeting real need, not salami slicing some off for pet projects.’ But Education Secretary Michael Gove accused Labour of hypocrisy, pointing out that the last government ignored Office for National Statistics warnings of a baby boom as early as 2004. Under Labour, councils were told to cut primary places. Mr Gove said: ‘Labour’s hypocrisy is breathtaking. For years they ignored warnings about the baby boom and splurged billions on extravagant secondary school projects instead. ‘By contrast, we have more than doubled funding for extra places to give local authorities the resources they need.’ Last July, Mr Gove announced £500million of funding to create more primary places in time for September 2012, taking the total spend to £1.3billion in 2011/12. Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘There are limits to how far a primary can grow and still retain the ethos that makes it special and welcoming to young children. ‘Primaries can run well at 500 or even 700 pupils, but then you’re stretching it.’",They could be taught in bingo halls and even a former Woolworths store .
"By . Eleanor Harding . UPDATED: . 21:14 EST, 19 March 2012 . In court: Geoffrey Butler, 54, was found guilty of racially aggravated harassment of his German neighbours . A teacher who harassed his neighbours by loudly playing the Dambusters theme and wartime Vera Lynn songs has been handed a court order banning him from being nasty to Germans. Geoffrey Butler subjected Reinhard and Kathryn Wendt – who moved here from Germany in 1999 – to four years of ‘hell’ by playing the music, whistling patriotic tunes and talking loudly about Nazis while pretending to be on his phone in the garden. The 54-year-old had denied the hate campaign, but was found guilty of racially aggravated harassment by magistrates yesterday. He avoided being sent to jail only after the Wendts pleaded for leniency. Instead, magistrates imposed a three-year conditional discharge and ordered Butler to pay the £1,800 court costs. The maths teacher – who is now unemployed and on benefits – was also given a restraining order which requires him not to use gestures or language which might be considered offensive to German people. He is barred from playing loud music and making abusive comments and will be hauled back before the courts if he breaks the terms of the orders. The neighbours’ relationship soured shortly after the German couple moved to the riverside village of Lower Upnor, Kent, in 2007. It involved a dispute over the ownership of a tiny strip of land next to their homes. Dispute: Neighbours Kathyrn and Reinhard Wendt, who is German, outside Medway Magistrates Court . Mr Wendt accused Butler of whistling . the war tunes and regularly playing them from his car stereo. He also . told the court he had recorded the teacher playing one of Winston . Churchill’s wartime speeches. The 62-year-old claimed the harassment was ‘like waterboarding’. Events . came to a head last  April when the Wendts claimed they were sitting in . bed and saw  Butler taking a picture of them through the window. The . teacher, whose family members served in the RAF including one in the . 617 ‘Dambusters’ squadron, was arrested the following month. Reinhard Wendt and his wife Kathryn live on the left opposite Mr Butler. The couple moved to the village of Lower Upnor in Kent in 2007 . At . an earlier hearing, Mrs Wendt, also 62, tearfully told the court: ‘I . just want to live a peaceful life. I haven’t looked for any trouble.’ In his evidence yesterday, Butler claimed he had been called names and wrestled to the ground by Mr Wendt. The German ‘charged’ at him with a garden chair shouting ‘get off my land, big head’, he claimed. But . giving the verdict at Medway Magistrates Court, chairman of the bench . Colin Smith said: ‘We find Mr and Mrs Wendt to be compelling, credible . and consistent witnesses. ‘We find Butler’s evidence to be evasive and contradictory, both in court and in police interview.’ A court heard Mr Butler blared out the themes to Dambusters, Dad's Army (pictured) and Rule Britannia . He said the magistrates believed the harassment was directed towards Mr Wendt because he is German. Sentencing, . Mr Smith said the offence would usually require a period of custody to . allow reports to be prepared but he would make allowances because the . Wendts requested leniency. Butler said he would appeal against the verdict. After . the case, Mr Wendt said: ‘The last five years have been difficult for . us. You can’t really describe it. I don’t think people understand. You . can’t move freely around the house without getting attacked verbally. It’s just very difficult living like that. ‘It’s been hell. It’s really been awful. We’ve been having nightmares and not sleeping. ‘We are happy with the outcome but I’m still frightened of him because he still lives there. We are sure that we will move now.’","Geoffrey Butler harassed his neighbour by loudly playing the Dambusters theme tune and wartime songs .

A mother today claimed she was treated 'like a criminal' by police during a truancy crackdown after taking her children out of school for eye test. Laura Young, 38, said she felt 'disgusted and embarrassed' after being quizzed by officers for ten minutes in front of shoppers in Tesco despite getting permission from her daughters' schools. She had been accompanying her children - Leah Harris, 12, and Kristeena, nine - on their way to the opticians when she stopped and forced to account for her actions. 'Disgusted': Laura Young, pictured with her daughters Leah Harris (centre) and Kristeena Harris, has spoken of her anger after being stopped by truancy police while taking her children out of school for a eye test . Single mum Laura claims the episode made her feel like she had committed a crime - when she was only concerned about her children’s sight. She said: 'It was absolutely disgusting - the whole thing was very embarrassing and extremely upsetting. 'I was spoken to like I was a criminal in the middle of Tesco. I must have looked like a common criminal to any other customers and I certainly felt like one. 'My daughters had a legitimate reason to be off school and I don’t feel I should have to justify myself to anyone. 'I had told the schools why I had taken my daughters from school and they were fine with it. My children were quite confused about the whole situation too.' 'Embarrassing': Laura Young claims she was questioned by officers in full view of shoppers at her local Tesco (not one above) Full-time mum Laura, from Barnstaple, Devon, phoned Leah’s secondary school and Kristeena’s primary school to tell them about the eye test on Monday. She took them to the town’s Tesco to buy them lunch at 11am before their eye examination - but they were stopped in their tracks by Devon and Cornwall Police during a truancy crackdown inside the store. Laura said: 'Leah’s maths teacher had phoned me because he was worried about her eyesight and Kristeena also needed a test. 'I decided to book them in for the first available eye test, which was on a week day, as I was anxious to get them checked. 'I phoned the schools to explain that I would have to take them out for the whole day - as it would have been difficult to walk and pick them up from two schools miles apart. 'But when we went to Tesco to get something, two officers were stood inside the store and took all my details. They spoke to me for about ten minutes. 'They wanted to know why my children were not in school, their date of births and what schools they went too. 'I was angry as I felt I was being targeted and I had done nothing wrong. I do not know why they would approach children who were already with a parent.' Devon and Cornwall Police said its officers and an education welfare officer had taken part in a truancy sweep across Barnstaple. It said 64 children had been asked why they were not in school and one was returned to class, during the day. A spokesman for the force claimed he could not comment on the incident, but said he was confident any officer would have spoken to the parent with 'consideration and respect'. A Tesco spokeswoman said: 'This was not a pre-arranged event - the police happened to be in the store when they decided to speak to the customer. 'That is obviously a matter for them to comment on. We are sorry that the customer was upset by this incident.'","Laura Young had permission from daughters' schools .

Seeking justice: The parents of 19-year-old Megan Helal are suing Sigma Chi fraternity, as well as bartenders and fraternity members in her 2010 death . The parents of a 19-year-old college student who died after a night of heavy drinking at a fraternity party are suing the Greek organisation, as well as the bar where their teenage daughter was allegedly served drink after drink. Megan Helal, who was a student at Navarro College, was attending a Sigma Chi fraternity party with her boyfriend at Baylor University in 2010. She was said to have consumed between 10 to 17 vodka drinks within two hours, despite being underage and visibly drunk. Her heart stopped the next morning, and she died from arrhythmia, according to the autopsy report. Though the autopsy says she died of . natural causes, the family's attorney seeks to prove that alcohol was to . blame for her sudden passing. The family is filing the lawsuit a mere two days before the statute expires. Ms . Helal’s parents are suing both Sigma Chi’s national headquarters and . the now-defunct Sigma Chi chapter at Baylor, as well as the fraternity’s . risk management foundation, and the bar where the fraternity’s party . was held. The party, according to lawsuit, was supposedly in honour of the fraternity's newest recruits. Party location: Ms Helal attended the Sigma Chi party at Mynar's Bar in West, Texas . The Baylor University chapter was suspended after the incident. The lawsuit also alleges that Ms Helal’s Sigma Chi boyfriend and the owners and employees of the bar are responsible. During the party in March 2010, the family alleges that their daughter was continuously served vodka at Mynar Bar in West, Texas, despite the fact that she was underage and that she appeared visibly drunk. ‘Clearly, the bar didn’t monitor what was going on inside,’ Linda Turley, the family’s attorney, said. ‘They didn’t know who the liquor was being served to. They just kept track of how much they served.’ Cause of death: Though her autopsy cites she died from a natural heart condition, her family's attorney seeks to prove she died as a result of too much alcohol . Tragic: Ms Helal was taken to Hillcrest Hospital, where she later died . She added: ‘In addition, they allowed the fraternity to set up bottle service in a little room where the drinking was going on.’ Though Ms Helal’s autopsy revealed that she died of cardiac arrhythmia because of myocardial fibrosis, and alcohol was out ruled, her parents still believe there's more to the story. Arrest warrants were originally . issued for Mynar Bar’s owner – 66-yearold Linda McWilliams, as well as . the two bartenders – Amy Free, 35, and Carol Baker, 45 after Ms Helal's . death. Ms Helal played . volleyball for her college and was considering becoming a physical . therapist. She was described as a talented athlete. The lawsuit does not designate a specific amount of damages sought. Bump, set, spike: She was described as a talented volleyball player for her college, and had aspirations of becoming a physical therapist . Visiting: Ms Helal was visiting her boyfriend at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. He was a member of the school's Sigma Chi fraternity . The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission confirmed in 2010 that alcohol was purchased from Mynars on a pre-paid tab. Their initial investigation also revealed that five parties were involved – though 11 parties are listed in the lawsuit. The national Sigma Chi headquarters told MailOnline that as of early Tuesday, they had no official comment on the case.

'We remain . committed to solving this case and to identify and bring to justice the . person or persons responsible for the death of Ms. Jenkins.'

'I just hope they find whoever did it,' said a tearful Marion Beattie . Cairns, who owns The Creamery Restaurant in Danville, where Jenkins had . worked as a waitress at night. 'Her little boy - that's what breaks my . heart right now.' A makeshift memorial of luminaries - white paper bags with individual . notes from students on them - lined the entry to a main building at the . prestigious St Johnsbury Academy, where Jenkins worked as a science . teacher.

An empty 'handcuff' box and two used condoms have been found in the desperate search for a missing 15-year-old schoolgirl. Sierra LaMar was reported missing by her . mother on March 16, having never made it to the bus or her Morgan, Hill . California high school. A search volunteer found the empty box which was marked 'handcuffs' yesterday within 1.5miles of where the pretty teen's Samsung cellphone and Juicy-brand handbag were found. Mystery: Sierra Lamar, 15, disappeared on the walk to catch a bus to school on the morning of March 16 . Police ruled the disappearance . as a kidnapping as Sierra does not having a history as a runaway or any . unusually negative family problems. Interviews with friends and a search . of her computer also yielded no information indicating she fled. Investigators told Mercury News that the find could be a major breakthrough in the disappearance which has stumped police for two weeks, or it could be a simple coincidence. The Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office has sent the cardboard box and condoms for forensics tests. 'Other than the fact that it's pretty close to Sierra's mom's house, there's no indication at this time that it's related,' Sgt. Jose Cardoza told Mercury News. 'But we're collecting it as possible evidence.' 'This may be another significant piece of evidence, but it's hard to confirm that it's related at this time,' he added. The box, which was used to ship handcuffs by an unknown manufacturer, was empty, Cardoza said. Potential clue: The handcuff box and condoms were found, near the teenager's home, pictured, and close to where her phone and handbag were found abandoned as shown on the map . Hope: A fourth vigil was held last night for the missing 15-year-old in her hometown of Morgan Hill, California . It was found near a dead end about a mile from the intersection where Sierra was supposed to catch a bus bext to her home after 7am for school. A . day after her disappearance, sheriff's deputies found Sierra's . cellphone on Santa Teresa , an electronic window into her world which now sits in a San . Jose crime lab undergoing forensic tests. It . was in a field near where she normally caught a school bus in Morgan . Hill, a semi-rural community of 40,240 on the fringes of Silicon Valley . surrounded by mountains, orchards and reservoirs. The day after deputies located her . Samsung Galaxy smartphone, they came across Sierra's handbag a few . blocks away. Several items of her clothing - a San Jose Sharks T-shirt, . pants and undergarments - were folded neatly inside.

Clues: Her mother snapped this photo of her the morning she disappeared, appearing playful which followed her parents and friends' perception of nothing out of the ordinary . On Tuesday and Wednesday, a search of waterways, ponds and reservoirs in the Morgan Hill area came up empty. Cardoza . said the sheriff's dive team searched the Calero, Chesbro and Uvas . reservoirs, as well as the percolation ponds in the Morgan Hill and . southern Santa Clara County areas.

School: Last week, sheriffs investigators visited Miss Lamar's school of Sobrato High, suspending their ground search for interviews with her classmates and friends . Without a trace: While police dogs lost her scene at her mother's driveway her cell phone was recovered Sunday in a field nearby . Growing concern: Clothes belonging to Sierra Lamar have been found after the teenager went missing 12 days ago from her home in Morgan Hill, California . The law enforcement response has . included searching the homes of neighbors, contacting registered sex . offenders, interviewing friends and relatives, and stopping drivers who . travel the road where Sierra picked up the bus and where her phone and . purse were found to ask if they saw anything unusual. Marlene LaMar told investigators she last saw her daughter when she left for work about 6am on March 16. Just before 6:30am, when Sierra . ordinarily got ready for school, the teenager tweeted.

One body has been found and five others are presumed drowned after players from Motherwell Rugby Club were caught up in strong rip tides on Port Elizabeth's Bluewater Bay beach on Sunday. Officials said the players had gone for a swim in the water to cool off after a training session when powerful currents took hold. Freak currents: The Motherwell Rugby Club players had been swimming off Bluewater Bay beach in Port Elizabeth when they were swept out to sea . Sea rescuers said the rugby stars were among a group of 21 bathers caught up in the strong currents at midday on Sunday. National Sea Rescue Institute station commander Ian Gray said although 15 people were rescued after the tragedy, one has been confirmed dead and five are missing presumed drowned. Mr Gray said rescuers launched an extensive search for the missing rugby players but were forced to suspend the hunt at dusk. Mr Gray added: 'An extensive search by three NSRI sea rescue craft, a rescue rubber-duck and rescue jet-ski and the emergency services helicopter has revealed no sign of the five missing men. 'All are believed to be aged in their early 20's and all five missing are believed to be members of the Motherwell Rugby Club. 'An SA Air Force 15 Squadron Charlie Flight helicopter, carrying two Port Elizabeth NSRI rescue swimmers, has joined since first light in an ongoing search operation.' One player has been confirmed dead and five are missing presumed drowned after the South African tragedy . Some of the rescue team today described a scene of 'hell' as the swimmers were swept into the open water. Lifesaver Brendon Helm told South Africa's News24 website he felt helpless as he and eight colleagues realised they would be unable to save everyone. He said: 'It is something I will always remember. 'Only eight of us and 21 desperate people with wide open eyes begging to come out. 'Some of us took out two or three at a time and almost got into trouble ourselves.' The Motherwell Rugby Club today confirmed six of its players had died and said the men's families were still being informed. The team's manager Mcdisi Mazamba told how he had taken his players for their weekly training session at Port Elizabeth's Bluewater Bay beach, which lies on the Indian Ocean and is famous for its clean sand and safe swimming. The shaken coach said the athletes were enjoying a swim when strong currents dragged them out to sea. He added: 'Everything was peaceful, the sea was calm and they were up to their chests in the water. 'The next moment we just saw arms and hands in the air as the current swept them away.' Tragedy: Motherwell Rugby Club confirmed the news about their players on its Facebook page today . Rescuers said yesterday's tragedy happened after the rugby players became sucked up in a freak dangerous rip tide. The athletes, who were training for a national competition next month, were dragged away from the shore alongside several other swimmers. The 15 people who were pulled alive from the waves were treated on the beach for shock and near-drowning symptoms. Police confirmed an inquest had been opened into the tragedy and said the dead man's body had been sent for forensic examination by pathologists. The South African Rugby Union today described the incident as a 'devastating tragedy'. The organisation's president Oregan Hoskins said: 'These young men were preparing to compete in a Saru Easter Tournament in Cape Town in a fortnight and were enjoying a carefree day on the beach with their team-mates. 'To have their afternoon turned into a day of tragedy is shocking for the whole rugby community and our thoughts and prayers go out to their families.'","Players from Motherwell Rugby Club went into Bluewater Bay to rescue teammates but were also washed away .

An American football star has sensationally claimed he was assaulted by his estranged wife in front of his sons - after posting a Twitter picture of himself filling out a police report. NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders has revealed plans to press charges against his estranged wife Pilar Sanders after alleging that she attacked him in his Dallas home on Monday night. The 44-year-old, who enjoyed a successful career in both baseball and American football, said his estranged wife and another person entered his home and began 'kicking, biting, and scratching' in front of his two children. Claim: Deion Sanders posted this Twitter image appearing to show himself and his two sons, aged 10 and 12, filling out police reports after the alleged attack . 'Assault': Sanders, pictured left playing for the Baltimore Ravens in 2004, has endured a bitter and public divorce from his second wife Pilar, pictured right, after she was arrested . Pilar Sanders has since been arrested on domestic violence-related charges, but not before former Dallas Cowboys cornerback Sanders posted several tweets detailing the alleged attack. Sanders posted to his 387,000 Twitter followers: 'Pray for me and my kids now! They just witnessed their mother and a friend jump me in my room. She's going to jail n I'm pressing charges!' He then added in a post which has since been removed: 'I'm sad my boys witnessed this mess but I warned the police department here that she was gone try n harm me and my boys. This is on my mama!' The former NFL star also posted a photo, which has since been taken down, of him and his two sons, aged 10 and 12, sitting at home filling out what appears to be police paperwork. Alongside the image, he had posted the caption: 'filling out police reports now! Thank God for this platform to issue the Truth.' Outburst: Sanders made the claims against his estranged wife during an extraordinary post to his 387,000 followers on Twitter . Happier times: The couple, who met in 1999 after Sanders split from his first wife, have three children together but started divorce proceedings in December . According to TMZ.com, a police car and fire truck were seen outside Sanders' house in suburban Dallas on Monday night. Sanders filed for divorce from Pilar, his second wife, in December. The couple have endured an extremely rocky break-up, and despite starring in their own reality show, 'Deion and Pilar Prime Time Love', have had a very bitter and public divorce. They had met in 1999 and have three children together, as well as the two children Deion had from his first marriage. In February, Pilar filed a suit against Deion after claiming his aunt attacked her in her 10-bedroom home in Prosper, Texas, while Deion watched.

The 2012 Peace Index, produced by the Institute for Economics and Peace, named the East Coast state as the most peaceful in the country. Louisiana ranked last out of the 50 states for the 11th consecutive year, with the metropolitan area around New Orleans named as one of the most violent, second only to Detroit. The survey assesses the benefits of peace and the cost of violence in terms of law enforcement needed, prison facilities used, and other costs of a violent state. Serenity now: Maine was ranked the most peaceful state in the nation by the Institute for Economics and peace . Coastal: Portland, Maine is the largest city in the state . No violence here: Vermont tied with New Hampshire as second most peaceful, proving New England to be one of the more peaceful regions in the States . Steve Killelea, the founder and CEO of the Institute, told MSNBC.com: ‘What is absolutely clear from the index is that peaceful states perform better across a range of economic, health, education, and community factors.’ He noted that those living in more peaceful states had higher educational success rates, lower poverty, and better lives in general. The Peace Index shows some encouraging news as well – homicide rates have fallen nearly 50 per cent since the IEP began collecting data in 1991. Mr Killelea attributed the falling numbers to a number of factors, including an ageing population, more present law enforcement, and private security monitoring. Other peaceful states include Vermont, which tied for second with New Hampshire. Minnesota and Utah ranked fourth and fifth, respectively. Big Uneasy: Louisiana was ranked worst for violence, and New Orleans was named the second most violent city, next to Detroit . Peace in the world: New Orleans was the second most violent city, left; and Louisiana ranked last, right . New York state had the highest improvement in USPI score, with a 31 per cent decrease in violence. However, Louisiana was a poor performer and even lagged behind number 49 on the list, Tennessee. The institute took into consideration several factors that could contribute to the state’s alarming violence, including low socioeconomic standings, and little access to good health care and education. The state also has the highest number of children born to single parent households at 42 per cent.Wyoming was bumped up the list by 20 spots, falling at number 17 from 23, according to the report, while Arizona fell into the bottom five. However, the study notes that around 7.2million people, or around 2.38 per cent of America’s population, are under some form of correctional supervision. Running the gamut: The Northeast was generally peaceful, as is the Midwest; the South was generally less peaceful . Peace and quiet: Maine fell well below the national average for homicides, violent crime, and incarceration, but were average on small arms . Running over: Louisiana ran way beyond the national average for homicides, and was the state with one of the greatest incarceration numbers . According to the IEP, violence and its subsequent consequences have a significant financial impact on its residents. In Maine, violence costs the average taxpayer around $1,300 annually, but in other parts of the country, that cost skyrockets to about $3,257 every year. The institute notes that 17 states also managed to reduce a trifecta of ills – homicide, violent crime, and incarceration rates – showing that merely putting a criminal in prison does not decrease violence.","Institute for Economics and Peace named Maine most peaceful state in country .

Lisa Stanley rushed from her seat as the driver slumped forward and the vehicle veered dangerously towards a ditch. The 33-seater coach was picking up speed and had gone onto the hard shoulder of the M1 motorway in Derbyshire. Quick thinking: Lisa Stanley, 35, at the wheel of her car, who stopped the bus as the driver blacked out at the wheel - and prevented a big accident . But Lisa managed to slam her feet on the brakes, bringing them to a safe stop. The drama happened on Saturday just days after a Belgian coach crashed in Switzerland, killing 28 people.

Lisa, 35, coach of Team Northumbria's Netball Superleague team,said her 'instincts took over'. She said: 'I noticed the bus speed up and go up over the hard shoulder and I looked up to see what the driver was playing at. 'But I saw his head slump towards the window and he slipped towards the floor. 'I just jumped up to try to take control - it was like my instincts took over.' The team had been travelling from the North East for a Superleague clash at Loughborough Lightning in Leicestershire when the accident happened on Saturday. The team had stopped for a break just half an hour before the driver, who worked for Stanley Coaches, fell unconscious near Junction 29A on the southbound carriageway at Holmewood, Derbyshire. Lisa said the driver, who is in his 60s, had been in good spirits with the girls as they set off again, but just a few miles down the road he blacked out. 'I put my hand on the wheel but the bus was heavy and it had hit the first barrier,' said Lisa, who has a nine-year-old daughter, Ellie. 'I pulled it away, but because it was heavy it came round and hit the barrier a second time. 'I got one leg over the driver who was falling to the floor and got my foot on the brake, and my other leg on the clutch, and pulled it straight before slamming on the brakes.' It was over in a matter of seconds but Lisa, of Seaham, County Durham. said the team had a lucky escape, as the bus was travelling at over 60mph. Lisa added: 'About five or six of the girls were asleep at the time when the bus hit the barrier.

Jet setter: Thomas Moran, pictured, spent 18 years on the run and raised families in two separate countries before he was finally caught - after moving just a mile from a police station . A father who spent 18 years on the run has revealed how he raised families in two separate countries before he was finally caught - after moving just a mile from a police station. Thomas Moran, 51, brought up five children by three different mothers in Ireland and England while evading authorities - despite jetting between the two countries an incredible sixty times. He was arrested in Northampton in 1993 for possession of drugs and on suspicion of intent to supply - but fled court and returned to his native Ireland during his 18 years as a ‘fugitive’. Despite officially being wanted by police, he split his time between England and Ireland enjoying sightseeing trips, quad biking holidays and fishing with his children. The grandfather-of-seven was only caught when he moved back to within a mile of Northampton’s police station and officers arrested him at home - where he had been officially registered and was claiming benefits. The builder - who has now pleaded guilty to the offence - told today of his relief at finally being free of the crime which has hung over his head for 18 years. He said: 'I had moved to England in 1987 because I needed to get the work. 'But when I was here I fell into a bad crowd and got into drugs and alcohol. 'After my arrest I was moved to a couple of different bail houses but the drugs were still everywhere so I thought I just have to get out of this place. 'So I went back to Ireland to look after my children and raise more kids. We just lived a normal life. 'We would go sightseeing, fishing, do water sports, I even took my youngest kids back to England for holidays but nobody ever said anything to me. 'It was as if they had completely lost me but surely if they wanted to catch me they could have quite easily considering how many times I went through customs.' Cheeky: Despite being wanted by police, Moran often enjoyed sightseeing trips, quad biking holidays and fishing with his children. This is a picture of one of his son's which he took while on the run during a visit to Northampton . On the run: Moran pictured with one of his children while in Ireland. He was arrested in Northampton in 1993 for possession of drugs and on suspicion of intent to supply - but fled court and returned to his native Ireland as a 'fugitive' Moran had three children from his first marriage but one died when she was a baby in the late 80s. The two surviving children who live in his home town of Drogheda, County Louth, Ireland, are 34 and 28. He had a daughter with another woman when he was living in England, who is now 22 and lives in Northampton. He has two boys with his current English girlfriend who are 15 and 16 - they were conceived when he was in Ireland but are now living in England. Moran moved back to Northampton in July last year and began claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance. Police only caught up with him by chance while cross-referencing court records and he was traced through his tenancy agreement. Happy: Moran pictured in 1994 - the year after he was arrested on drugs charges . He was arrested on February 28 at the property which was just over a mile away from the local police station. His long-term girlfriend and three youngest children are also living in Northampton but at a separate address. He added: 'I had to come back for work I was getting nothing in Ireland. 'We wanted to rebuild our lives here and have a fresh start. 'I was not sure if the police would still remember me but  I needed the work so I thought I might as well just face the music.' During a hearing at Northampton Crown Court, Moran pleaded guilty to two counts of possessing a class B drug with intent to supply, one count of simple possession and one count of failing to answer bail. Elizabeth Gooderham, prosecuting, said: 'Moran was granted bail to a hostel in Milton Keynes, returned back to Northampton, then went back to Milton Keynes, moved to Wellingborough and then onto Ireland where he remained until last year.' But the case was adjourned until April 16 after Judge David Tomlinson ordered Moran’s police records in Ireland to be checked.","Thomas Moran brought up five children by three different mothers in Ireland and England while evading authorities .

Victim: Jessica Sacco, 21, was stabbed, suffocated and dismembered at her home in Urbana, Ohio.

Puccio stabbed Miss Sacco, placed a bag over her head and suffocated her at home on around March 22, police believe. Watching the killing and helping dispose of some of the remains were flatmates Andrew Forney, 26, and his wife Kandis Forney, 25, both of Fenton, Michigan, along with a third couple from Urbana, it is alleged. Miss Sacco's body was found after a pedestrian alerted a police officer in a patrol car eight days later on March 30. Urbana Police Chief Matt Lingrell said last night that Puccio and Miss Sacco had met the Forneys on the Internet, but he would not be more specific. Chief Lingrell said the couples had known each other only a short time before the Forneys moved into the Urbana apartment about a month ago.

On the run: Chen Guangcheng is thought to have been helped in his escape from his home, which has angered Chinese authorities . A blind Chinese activist who dodged 100 guards to escape house arrest is believed to have taken refuge at the U.S. Embassy. Chen Guangcheng, 40, had been under heavy guard at his . house in Dongshigu village, in Shandong province southeast of Beijing, . after exposing forced abortions as part of China's one-child policy. But . after serving four years in prison and then being confined to his home, . the self-schooled lawyer is said to have fled from the authorities despite more than one hundred guards watching his village and . is now believed to be at the U.S. Embassy. The United States has not confirmed the reports by Texas-based ChinaAid and the Chinese government has declined to comment on Chen's escape. But Texas-based ChinaAid said it . 'learned from a source close to the Chen Guangcheng situation that Chen . is under U.S. protection and high level talks are currently under way . between U.S. and Chinese officials regarding Chen's status'. The claims could overshadow a two-day meeting with top Obama administration officials, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in Beijing from Thursday, and ignite new tensions between the two governments. Bob Fu, president of the religious and political rights advocacy group that has long campaigned for Chen's freedom, said: 'Because . of Chen's wide popularity, the Obama Administration must stand firmly . with him or risk losing credibility as a defender of freedom and the . rule of law.' The reports of Chen's escape come nearly three months after a Chinese official Wang Lijun fled into a U.S. consulate for over 24 hours on February 6, unleashing a scandal that has rattled the ruling Communist Party months before a once-in-a-decade leadership handover. Anger: The activist's detention for exposing forced abortions in China caused international outcry . Wang's brief flight to the U.S. consulate led to the downfall of top official Bo Xilai who had been . openly campaigning for a place in the inner circle of power in Beijing. Pu Zhiqiang, a Beijing lawyer and . rights advocate, said reliable contacts also told him Chen took refuge . in U.S. embassy grounds. He said: 'Everyone knew about the . suffering of Chen Guangcheng and his family but nobody dared raised his . head over this and ignored it. 'Chen Guangcheng has been the most . typical victim of this lawless, boundless exercise of power. But the day . has finally come when he has escaped from it.' Chen angered authorities in 2005 by . exposing forced abortion in his own village and others nearby as part of . China's one-child policy. Surrounded: Visitors trying to see Chen Guangcheng, including Christian Bale, have been forcibly removed from the village by over-zealous Chinese guards . He . was jailed soon after on a charge of 'blocking traffic' and damaging . property in a protest, and has been held under house arrested ever since . his release in September 2010. Lawyers and activists attempted to . visit Chen in him home ever since have been forcibly denied entry to his . village by guards, while the man himself compared his own home to a . 'prison' due to his plight. It . is thought the Chinese authorities had no legal grounds for detaining . him, and guards even scuffled with Hollywood star Christian Bale when . the Batman actor tried to visit Chen in his home. Campaigner He Peirong, who is said to . have helped Chen flee his house, would not discuss details of his . escape, but denied reports he had entered the U.S. Embassy in Beijing on . Thursday night.

New footage has emerged of the aftermath of the police shooting that triggered last summer's riots. Mark Duggan was killed during a . pre-planned operation involving officers from the Metropolitan Police's . Trident gun crime unit in Tottenham, north London, on August 4. The video, obtained by the BBC, was filmed by someone who says they witnessed the shooting. It shows attempts by paramedics to save Mr Duggan's life as well as footage of his body covered by a red blanket. An audio expert has told the . broadcaster that the witness can be heard on the tape saying: 'He jumped out and then he's took . him out,' according to the BBC which has obtained a copy of . the footage. The Independent Complaints Commission . is still carrying out an investigation into the circumstances of the . shooting, with an inquiry into his death failing to establish the . sequence of events concerning a handgun found at the scene. The watchdog has condemned the BBC's decision to broadcast the footage before it has seen it. IPCC Commissioner Rachel Cerfontyne said: 'The IPCC is conducting a sensitive investigation of considerable public interest. 'Given this, it is particularly . disappointing that BBC News did not afford us the opportunity to view . this footage in advance of broadcast, despite our repeated requests. 'Broadcasting this footage is likely . to have caused considerable distress to Mr Duggan's family, friends and . the local community, in addition to potentially prejudicing our . investigation and any legal process that may follow. Aftermath: The new video captures potentially important information about the shooting of Mark Duggan . Tensions: Within days of the shooting, public outrage exploded into massive disorder, looting and rioting . 'We have asked the BBC to pass our . contact details to the witness and would urge them to come forward. 'We . fully expect BBC News to now pass us the unedited footage so we are able . to fully assess its implications.

An air ambulance can be seen hovering . overhead as paramedics attempt to revive Mr Duggan near the grey people . carrier taxi he was travelling in. The taxi is blocked in by an unmarked police car and an ambulance is parked nearby. The witness provides occasional commentary of what has happened and recounts the moments before the filming began. The BBC has used an actor to relay these comments to protect the source of the video, who wishes to be anonymous. Shock: The scene on Ferry Lane, Tottenham, become a focus for public grief over the shooting of Mark Duggan . According to the audio analyst, the . witness says on the tape: 'They blocked him in, they blocked him in. 'He . jumped out... And then he's taken out, shot him... because I heard them . shout at him yeah, ""Put it down, put it down"".' A BBC spokeswoman said Mr Duggan's family were aware that the footage would be shown on television. 'The BBC is fully aware of the . sensitivities around this story and ensured that Mark Duggan's family . were informed about the footage before it was broadcast. 'Requests for BBC un-transmitted . material are dealt through our legal department, regardless of the . subject matter. We require requests for un-transmitted material to be . made through the courts.' Impact: Mark Duggan's family, seen attending his funeral, complained to the IPCC they were not given enough information about the circumstances surrounding his shooting in the immediate aftermath . Mass disorder: Police relations with local communities have suffered significant damage since the shooting . Eruption: Two days after Duggan died, the Tottenham riots exploded after his family . spent five frustrating hours seeking a meeting and explanation from . local police chief . Both the IPCC and Scotland Yard have . admitted mishandling the way they dealt with Mr Duggan's family in the . aftermath of the shooting. Initial reports that Mr Duggan shot at . police were dismissed by ballistic tests which later found that a . bullet which lodged itself in one officer's radio was police issue. Police failed to formally notify the family of his death, giving his parents, Pamela Duggan and Bruno Hall, false hope. Relatives subsequently complained about their treatment, which was upheld by the IPCC. A coroner's officer has said a . provisional date of January 28 2013 has been set for Mr Duggan's inquest . - but only if the eight-week inquest is given the go-ahead during a . review on October 23.

University of Toronto anthropologist Michael Chazan said: ‘The analysis pushes the timing for the human use of fire back by 300,000 years, suggesting that human ancestors as early as Homo erectus may have begun using fire as part of their way of life. Wonderwerk caves in South Africa: The huge cave near the edge of the Kalahari Desert has been the scene of previous excavations which have uncovered an extensive record of human occupation . ‘The control of fire would have been a major turning point in human evolution. ‘The impact of cooking food is well documented, but the impact of control over fire would have touched all elements of human society. ‘Socialising around a camp fire might actually be an essential aspect of what makes us human.’ The research is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences today.","Ash found among bones and burned plants in South African cave .

The cost of having a PO Box address is to rise by a staggering 30 per cent tomorrow – hitting small businesses, charities and sports clubs. Consumer groups say they have only just found out about the increase from £170 to £222 as the news was buried in the small print when the Royal Mail announced price hikes for stamps, which also come into effect tomorrow. The latest rise means that the annual cost of a PO Box has soared almost fourfold since 2009, when it cost just  £62 a year. Hikes: Royal Mail has increased the cost of sending post to a PO Box fourfold since 2009 . Consumer watchdog Which? said: ‘Many people use PO Boxes to keep their business and personal correspondence separate. 'They have been stunned by  the size of the increase.’ One reader of Which? wrote: ‘This is frankly obscene! I feel like I have  been attacked, mobbed. 'I do understand that prices need to go up, and usually  do go up, but by this much? This is outrageous.’ Royal Mail says it has lost £1 billion on its core postal business over the past  four years as it is delivering fewer  letters but to more addresses. Part of the price rise on PO Boxes is due to the introduction of VAT on the service. The Royal Mail admitted the rise would be ‘difficult’ but said: ‘We have thought very carefully about the impact on our customers and on our own business.’ Meanwhile stores are bracing themselves for a last-minute rush to buy stamps today, before the cost of  first-class postage rises from 46p to 60p, and second-class from 36p to 50p. Going up: Royal Mail is to be given the freedom to set its own prices for first-class stamps . The hikes come after an overhaul of the rules governing Royal Mail, which the Government plans to privatise from 2013, was announced by communications regulator Ofcom. It follows an Ofcom consultation from October, last year, which endorsed the removal of price constrictions. The Ofcom changes actually mean Royal Mail can charge as much as it likes for first class stamps, while second class stamps have been capped at 55p at today's prices, rising with inflation - a potential 53 per increase. As the nation's 'Universal Service Provider' of postal services, Royal Mail will continue to be constrained on what it can charge for second class post - but at 55p, Ofcom has set the cap at the very top end of the price range put forward in the October consultation. The cap, which can rise with inflation each year, will extend to second class small parcel and large letters up to 2kg in weight. The overhaul has been prompted by a financial crisis at Royal Mail. The service, which is currently owned by the state, has faced increased competition from private delivery firms and a collapse in postal demand as individuals and businesses move to electronic communications, including email and social media. Moya Greene, chief executive of Royal Mail, said in March this year:  'We know how hard it is for households and businesses when our economy is as tough as it is now. No-one likes to raise prices in the current economic climate but, regretfully, we have no option. 'Royal Mail has lost £1 billion over the last four years; the sustainability of the service is now at risk. Price increases are needed to return the Universal Service to sustainability.'","Consumer groups accuse Royal Mail of 'burying' increase in small print of price rise announcement .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 16:42 EST, 1 May 2012 . Guilty: Adis Medunjanin was convicted of an suicide mission seen as one of the closest calls since the September 11 attacks . A New York man has been convicted of plotting an aborted suicide mission against New York City subways in 2009 - a case that featured the first-time testimony from admitted homegrown terrorists about Al-Qaeda's fixation with pulling off another attack on American soil. A jury found Adis Medunjanin guilty today of all counts for his role in a terror plot that federal authorities say was one of the closest calls since September 11, 2001. 'This is Terrorism 101,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Berit Berger said in closing arguments in federal court in Brooklyn. 'The goal of this conspiracy was to kill as many people as possible.' Medunjanin could be ordered to spend the rest of his life in prison when he is sentenced on September 7. Defence attorney Robert Gottlieb said he disagreed with the verdict and would appeal, but said the trial showed that the U.S. court system - not a military tribunal - is best for prosecuting terror crimes. 'The world and our national government including all our politicians should take note that this is the way crimes should be decided, not in a military commission, not in a star chamber, but in America,' he said. Medunjanin showed no visible reaction to the verdicts. Gottlieb said Medunjanin asked his lawyer to 'tell his family to be strong.' His mother and sister testified during the trial of terrifying late-night raids by federal agents out for Medunjanin. The defence admitted that the Bosnian-born Medunjanin wanted to fight for the Taliban, but they insisted he never agreed to spread death and destruction in the city where his family put down roots. Medunjanin, 27, went overseas to fulfill a 'romantic version of jihad... His plan and intent was to join the Taliban and stand up for what he believes in,' Gottlieb said in his closing. 'That was his purpose.' Suspect: Adis Medunjanin, pictured third from left in this courtroom sketch, was convicted of his role in a failed plot to attack the NYC subway system . Target: Mendunjanin and his cohorts were plotting a coordinated suicide attack during rush hour in New York City . The government's case was built on . the testimony of four men: two other radicalized Muslim men from Queens . who pleaded guilty in the subway plot, a British would-be shoe bomber . and a man originally from Long Island who gave Al-Qaeda pointers on how . best to attack a Walmart store. Najibullah . Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay, both former high school classmates of . Medunjanin, told jurors that the scheme unfolded after the trio traveled . to Pakistan in 2008 to avenge the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. While receiving terror training at outposts in the South Waziristan region of Pakistan, al-Qaida operatives encouraged the American recruits to return home for a suicide-bombing mission intended to spread panic and cripple the economy. Among the targets considered were New York Stock Exchange, Times Square and Grand Central Terminal, the men testified. Deadly plan: Medunjanin pleaded not guilty to charges accusing him of hatching a plot with two former high school classmates from Queens, Najibullah Zazi (above) and Zarein Ahmedzay . In a later meeting in New York, the . plotters decided to strap on bombs and blow themselves up at rush hour . on Manhattan subway lines because the transit system is 'the heart of . everything in New York City,' Zazi said. Zazi told jurors how he learned to distill explosives ingredients from nail polish remover, hydrogen peroxide and other products sold at beauty supply stores. When leaving Pakistan, he relocated to Colorado, where he perfected a homemade detonator in a hotel room and set out for New York City by car around the eighth anniversary of 9/11. The plot — financed in part by $50,000 in credit card charges - was abandoned after Zazi noticed that everywhere he drove in New York, a car followed. Supergrass: Saajid Muhammad Badat, pictured, planned to blow up a transatlantic plane in 2001, and testified against Medunjanin . 'I think law enforcement is on us,' he . recalled telling Ahmedzay. Later, he said he told Medunjanin in a text . message, 'We are done.' The other convicted terrorists were called as witnesses to give a rare glimpse into Al-Qaeda's training methods and the mindset of its leadership. In a videotaped deposition made public for the first time during the trial, Al-Qaeda supergrass Saajid Badat recounted a clandestine meeting where Osama bin Laden explained the rationale behind the failed plot for Badat and Richard Reid to attack trans-Atlantic flights with bombs hidden in shoes. Bin Laden 'said the American economy is like a chain,' the British man said. 'If you break one — one link of the chain — the whole economy will be brought down. So after September 11 attacks, this operation will ruin the aviation industry and in turn the whole economy will come down.' Bryant Neal Vinas, of Patchogue on Long Island, testified that he went to Pakistan in 2007 and later joined Al-Qaeda forces in an attack against American soldiers. Vinas described how he suggested to others in Al-Qaeda in the summer of 2008 that they could plant explosives in suitcase aboard a Long Island Rail Road train or hide them inside a television that was being returned to a Walmart. An attack on the popular retail outlet 'would cause a very big economy hit,' he said. In February, the court heard Medunjanin's 911 call as he planned to commit 'Jihad' while speeding on a Queens highway. 'This is Adis. We love - we love death,' he says in English to a confused 911 operator. The . rest of his diatribe before the crash was in Arabic, but translated as: . 'There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is the messenger of Allah'. Crash: Authorities said Medunjanin got into his Nissan Altima (seen above) and crashed on the Whitestone Expressway after finding out that he was being investigated .","Adis Medunjanin faces life in prison for plot against subway system .

But its fading image has taken another battering, as its beaches have today been named and shamed, once again, among Britain’s worst. Experts warned that ‘no-swimming’ signs may soon be erected in Blackpool and elsewhere along the Lancashire coastline unless the water quality is urgently improved. Iconic: A child having a donkey ride on Blackpool beach . In 2015 stringent European rules will see the warning signs put up if a beach consistently fails an inspection. The latest failure for Blackpool was issued by the Marine Conservation Society in its Good Beach Guide and will undoubtedly alarm tourism chiefs in the area. Of the 25 beaches the campaign group failed, six were on the Lancashire coastline, including two in Blackpool. Robert Keirle, pollution programme manager for the campaign group, said: ‘This problem goes back for as long as I can remember and I’ve been coming here for 20-odd years. ‘This is a lesson Blackpool is just not learning or a message they are not heeding. I keep explaining what the problems are and how they need to be addressed and we are just not progressing. ‘By 2015 the standards for water quality are being tightened. If they are failing now they won’t stand a chance of passing by then. Wet weekend in Blackpool: The outlook for the town hasn't improved since the damp Easter Bank holiday . ‘And if they fail the bathing water quality inspection over five consecutive years they will be forced to erect signs warning tourists not to go into the water. ‘They might as well flush the millions they have spent regenerating the area down the sewer.’ Mr Keirle said the local council had failed to accept the ‘magnitude’ of the problem and together with the environment agency and local water companies had become embroiled in ‘a circle of blame’. ‘This has been dragging on for a very long time and it’s the entire Lancashire coast that urgently needs attention,’ he said. ‘It’s consistently the worst-performing part of the UK – not just England, but the whole of the UK. ‘We have isolated resorts elsewhere that fail every so often but we are consistently failing an entire coastline.’ Overall, however, more than two-thirds of UK beaches surveyed last summer – 516 out of 754 – were recommended for ‘excellent’ water quality. This is an 8 per cent rise on the previous year’s figures, and the best set of results in 25 years of the guide. But the MCS warned that the heavy rainfall of the past week could see raw sewage from overflow pipes enter bathing areas. The North East was the best-performing region, with 53 out of 64 beaches recommended for excellent water quality. The North West was worst with only eight out of 37 beaches recommended. In the South East 94 out of 126 beaches were recommended while 154 out of 193 in the South West were praised.","European rules will see the warning signs put up if a beach consistently fails inspections .

It has been blamed for extreme weather conditions, destroying habitats and melting polar ice caps, but now global warming has another thing to answer for – causing more home runs in baseball. While commentating at a Major League game on Saturday, baseball announcer Tim McCarver bemused viewers with his rather radical theory linking baseball with climate change. On air at Busch Stadium in St. Louis, the Fox announcer shared his original views. Texas Rangers Josh Hamilton hits a home run against the New York Yankees . Aspiring meteorologist?: Fox Sports announcer Tim McCarver who surprised viewers with his climate change and baseball theory . ‘It has not been proven, but I think ultimately it will be proven that the air is thinner now, there has been climactic changes over the last 50 years in the world and I think that’s one of the reasons that balls are carrying much better now than I remember,’ he said. ‘You know, the ball that Ramirez hit out and the ball Freese hit out, I didn’t think either one was going to be a home run, yet they made it.’ Fellow broadcaster Joe Buck made light of the surprising theory, retorting, ‘So that’s your inconvenient truth?’, referencing Al Gore’s book about global warming. Others, however, took the comments more to heart, with experts and amateurs alike taking to blogs and media sites to debate whether there is any truth to McCarver’s statement – or whether it was just a lot of hot air. DeadSpin said the remark was ‘one of . the stupidest things ever spoken on a television broadcast today’ while . The American Spectator slated it as an ‘uncharacteristic but really dumb . observation’. Lighter air? The Busch Stadium in St Louis, where McCarver was announcing . However Scientific American was not so quick to dismiss the comments, citing the book The Physics of Baseball by Robert Adair, a retired physics professor from Yale University, to support McCarver’s theory. Professor Adair calculated that a two-degree temperature rise will add one foot to a 400-foot home run ball, increasing home run odds by about 1.75 per cent. Former player: Tim McCarver clutches his bat in August 1967 . McCarver also gained tentative support from the Washington Post, which stated that ‘data and physics are on the side of McCarver… to an extent.’ However Penn State climatologist Michael Mann told the blog that increasing levels of carbon emissions behind climate change could make the atmosphere heavier, decreasing the number of home runs. Scientific American and others argued the countless other variables that could affect the number of home runs hit – aside from possible changes in air composition. The changing height of a major league hitter from five feet nine inches to six feet one inch, for example, or changes in playing conditions or diet or equipment. Where there was some consensus however, was that it is not quite time for the aspiring meteorologist to give up his day job just yet.",Baseball announcer Tim McCarver bemused viewers with his theory linking baseball and climate change .

The grass being used for the athletics field at the Olympic Games comes from Samantha Cameron’s father’s sprawling ‘back garden’. It has emerged that the turf in the 80,000-seat Olympic Stadium was grown at Sir Reginald Sheffield’s Normanby Hall estate near Scunthorpe. County Turf, which rents land from the Sheffields, was sub-contracted to supply the grass for the stadium’s infield by the Olympic Delivery Authority. Top turf: Grass being used for the athletics field at the Olympic Games . comes from Samantha Cameron's father's sprawling 'back garden' in . Scunthorpe, it has emerged . But the source of its premium sod had remained under wraps until now. The grass will be graced by hundreds of Olympic stars taking part in field events, including heptathlete Jessica Ennis in javelin, high jump, long jump and shot put. It will also be used for pole vault, triple jump, discus and hammer throwing. A source said: ‘County Turf often supply grass to stadia and this was no different. They rent land from the Normanby estate, which is close to where they are based.’ The firm, which regularly supplies grass for sports venues such as the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, provided 360 rolls for the 9,000 square metre field. Sir Reginald, 66, a descendant of King Charles II, will not profit directly from  the deal. The baronet owns 3,000 acres of prime Lincolnshire farmland as well as a second estate, £5million Sutton Park near York. Toff turf: British heptathlete Jessica Ennis, left will be hoping to land her javelin throws into the Olympic field turf which belongs to the father of Samantha Cameron, right .

The Sheffields moved out of Normanby Hall in 1963 when it was handed over to North Lincolnshire Council in lieu of death duties, but Sir Reginald continues to own the surrounding land. The 300-acre Normanby Hall estate has been in the family since 1590. After the Sheffield family left the property, they moved to nearby Thealby Hall in the village of Burton upon Stather. The Prime Minister’s wife and her sister Emily grew up at the Grade II listed hall with their parents, Sir Reginald and Annabel, until they divorced when the girls were children. Sir Reginald continues to live at the hall with his second wife, Victoria. While the Normanby grass was selected for the athletics field, it is not being used for the opening ceremony’s ‘countryside stage’ at the same venue in the Olympic Park. Last month ceremony director Danny Boyle unveiled his vision for ‘a green and pleasant land’ for the opening scene, showcasing Britain’s pastoral history. It will include real fields and farmyard animals. Yesterday, aerial photographs of the stadium showed that the rural set was almost complete. During the ceremony, this will be replaced with a more urban stage, modelled on the opening credits of the TV soap opera EastEnders.

Today, when love letters are all but extinct, teenagers conduct their relationships in coarse text-speak via mobile phones, Twitter and Facebook. But 18-year-old Herbert Wilkins and Ethel Ormerod, 15, fell in love in the more innocent climate of Victorian England. Herbert, a woollen clerk, poured out his feelings for factory machinist Ethel in a series of romantic handwritten notes which have emerged after they were put up for sale on eBay and bought by archivists. The heartfelt missives chronicle the forbidden affair between the young lovers who lived in neighbouring villages near Rossendale, Lancashire. Love: Extraordinary handwritten notes between Herbert Wilkins and Ethel Ormerod more than 110 years ago have emerged . Couple: The handwritten letters capture the blossoming love of Herbert Wilkins, left, and Ethel Ormerod, right . Beginning in September 1898 they . reveal how the couple were forced to meet in secret because Ethel’s . father didn’t approve of their relationship. After a six-year clandestine affair, . they eventually married in 1904 when Ethel turned 21 and no longer . needed her parents’ backing. Addressed to ‘My dearest Ethel’, Herbert’s . letters tell how the couple swapped locks of their hair as love tokens . and tried to conceal their meetings from village gossips. They include several poems, including one for ‘A Love Valentine, and are signed ‘Yours Forever, Herbert’. Romance: The notes begin in 1898 when Herbert was 18 and Ethel was just 16. They talked of gossip in their Lancashire village about their affair, and of secret rendezvous at a local railway station . Historic: Amazingly the 40-strong collection of letters remained intact and were kept in an old Cadbury's Princess Elizabeth chocolate box. They eventually turned up for sale on Ebay . He went to great lengths to keep their . liaison under wraps, sending notes via friends or hand-delivering them . to Ethel at work. In one extract dated May 8, 1901, Herbert tells Ethel: . ‘You are my own. No-one else in this world for me. ‘If I cannot have you I will die not . married. You will think I am deeply in love when you read this. But it . does not matter, it is only what you know already. ‘I think you love me as much as I love . you. Hell I am certain. You would not have stuck so close to me all . these years if you didn’t do and I know you will not give up now when it . seems like being in Heaven now.’ Fortunate: David Tilsley, the collections manager at the Lancashire Archives in Preston, which recently acquired the series of letters . Display: The letters are available for the public to see at the Lancashire Archives in Preston after being snapped up by an archivist for £78 . On July 4 that year he wrote: ‘As I . have told you many a time I love you dearer than anything in the world. I . love you dearer than my own life.’ The 40-letter collection, found in a . 1940s Cadbury’s Princess Elizabeth chocolate box, are to go on public . display after being bought by Lancashire County Council’s archive . service for £78 from a collector. Yesterday the Daily Mail tracked down . the couple’s granddaughter, Christine French, 60, who said her family . had known nothing about her grandparents’ secret affair.

"By . Tammy Hughes . PUBLISHED: . 04:42 EST, 9 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:43 EST, 9 July 2012 . Gunmen stormed a Pakistani army camp today, killing seven soldiers and a policeman who tried to intervene. The unrest happened in Gujrat where thousands of hardline Islamists spent the night on their way to the capital to protest over the government's recent decision to reopen the Nato supply line to Afghanistan. Police chief Basharat Mahmood said it was unclear if any of the Islamist protesters were involved in the incident but that it was 'surely a terrorist attack.' Unrest: Protesters shout slogans during a rally condemning the movement of Nato supplies to Afghanistan through Pakistan . The camp was attacked at around 5.20am local time, a little less than an hour after the leaders of the Difah-e-Pakistan, or Defence of Pakistan, protest movement finished delivering speeches inside the city. The group, which includes hardline Islamist politicians and religious leaders, left the city of Lahore yesterday along with 8,000 supporters in 200 vehicles to make the 185-mile (300km) journey to Islamabad. They travelled about halfway, spent the night in Gujrat and planned to hold a protest in front of parliament in the capital today. Two Pakistani men cheer as they set fire to a picture of President Obama. Many still resent America for an airstrike that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers seven months ago . Painful memories: Dissidents burn tires during a protest against the agreement to reopen NATO supply route, in Peshawar, Pakistan . The roughly half a dozen gunmen who attacked the camp were riding in a car and on motorcycles. They killed seven soldiers at the camp and a policeman who tried to intercept them as they were escaping. Four policemen and at least three soldiers were injured. The camp that was attacked was set up to look for the body of an army major who was flying a helicopter when it crashed into a river in the area, said police. The leaders of Difah-e-Pakistan include people with known militant links, including Hafiz Saeed, the founder of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group, and Maulana Samiul Haq, known as the father of the Taliban. But they are not known to be supporters of the Pakistani Taliban, who have waged a bloody insurgency against the state over the past few years and killed thousands of soldiers and police. Crowds: Demonstrators of political parties and religious groups that form an alliance Difa-e-Pakistan (Defence of Pakistan) Council as they prepare for long-march to Islamabad . Protesters stand in front of a banner written in Urdu which reads 'Restoration of NATO supply is negation to Parliamentary resolutions' Many of the Difah-e-Pakistan leaders have strong historical links with Pakistani intelligence, and the group is widely believed to have been supported by the army to put pressure on the US while the government negotiated over the Nato supply line. Pakistan closed the route in November in retaliation for American air strikes which killed 24 Pakistani soldiers. The government finally agreed to reopen the supply line last week after the US apologised for the deaths. One of the reasons Pakistan waited so long to allow Nato troop supplies to resume was that it was worried about domestic backlash in a country where anti-American sentiment is rampant. Difah-e-Pakistan leaders said yesterday that they were holding their so-called 'long march' to Islamabad to prevent Pakistan from becoming a slave to the US and to show that many citizens are unhappy with the decision to reopen the route. But the number of protesters has been relatively small so far given Pakistan's population of 190 million, and the demonstration is unlikely to have any effect on the government's decision. The route: Drivers sit on top of a fuel tanker truck used to transport fuel to Nato forces . Troops: US Marines from Kilo Company of the 3rd Battalion 8th Marines Regiment patrol in Garmser, Helmand Province . Meanwhile the Taliban has claimed responsibility for a roadside bomb attack in eastern Afghanistan in which six Nato service members were killed. A statement from Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the soldiers died when their tank ran over the device at around 8pm yesterday evening in Wardak province, south of Kabul. Nato would not disclose the nationalities of the service members killed, but Afghan officials said they were American. In a shocking video published by the MailOnline yesterday Taliban soldiers are seen to execute a woman in a burqa for her part in a love triangle. The 22-year-old woman, said to have been married to a member of a hardline Taliban militant group, was shot dead after being accused of adultery with a Taliban commander. The disturbing footage was taken as show a crowd of bearded men gather to watch a rifle-wielding gunman shoot her in the head and back during the execution in Qimchok village, in Afghanistan's Parwan province.","Gunmen killed seven soldiers and a policeman who tried to intervene .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 03:16 EST, 9 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:51 EST, 9 July 2012 . Robin Gilbert didn't set out to confront gender stereotypes when she split up the boys and girls at her elementary school in rural southwestern Idaho. But that's exactly what happened, with her Middleton Heights Elementary now among dozens of public schools nationwide being targeted by the American Civil Liberties Union in a bitter struggle over whether single-sex learning should be continued. Under pressure, single-sex programs have been dropped at schools from Missouri to Louisiana. 'It doesn't frustrate me,' Gilbert said of the criticism, 'but it makes the work harder.' Segregation: Increasing numbers of schools are splitting up boys and girls as research shows that classes can be better tailored to the needs of each gender . While Gilbert's school is believed to be the only one in Idaho offering single-sex classes, the movement is widespread in states like South Carolina, which has more than 100 schools that offer some form of a single-gender program. Single-sex classes began proliferating after the U.S. Education Department relaxed restrictions in 2006. Margaret Spellings was the Secretary of Education from 2005 to 2009 under the administration of George W. Bush. With research showing boys, particularly minority boys, are graduating at lower rates than girls and faring worse on tests, plenty of schools were paying attention. In 2002, only about a dozen schools were separating the sexes, according to the National Association for Single Sex Public Education, an advocacy group. Now, an estimated 500 public schools across the country offer some all-boy and all-girl classrooms. Same-sex classes increased under the administration of George Bush, left, while Margaret Spellings, right, was Secretary of Education . Proponents argue the separation allows for a tailored instruction and cuts down on gender-driven distractions among boys and girls, such as flirting. But critics decry the movement as promoting harmful gender stereotypes and depriving kids of equal educational opportunities. The ACLU claims many schools offer the classes in a way that conflicts with the U.S. Constitution and Title IX, a federal law banning sex discrimination in education. Researchers also have weighed in. Diane F. Halpern, a former president of the American Psychological Association, co-authored a review of studies last fall in the journal Science that found research doesn't support the benefits of single-sex education. Additionally, there are lots of problems whenever you segregate people into groups, Halpern said. 'Stereotyping increases so we really do have lots of data that says it's just not supported,' she said. However, proponents have put out their own studies, showing the benefits of separating students. Middleton Heights Elementary cited the research when it first piloted single-sex classes in a few grades. The goal was to address the struggles boys were having in reading. Targeted: One single sex classroom allowed teachers to address the struggles boys were having reading (file picture) The idea proved so popular that single-sex classes have expanded throughout the school. Parents can opt out, a choice required by law, if they want their kids in a traditional coed classroom. In the single-sex classes, teachers use microphones that allow them to electronically adjust the tone of their voice to match the level that research suggests is best for boys. When preparing for a test, the boys may go for a run, or engage in some other activity, while the girls are more likely to do calming exercises, such as yoga. On a recent tour, Gilbert peeked into a classroom of third grade boys, who had decorated their walls with a camping theme, complete with construction paper campfires and a sign that read 'fishing for books.' Next door, the third-grade girls opted for an 'under the sea' motif. When they spotted Gilbert in their classroom door way, a few of the girls jumped from their seats and ran to give her a quick embrace. They learn the same curriculum, they still lunch and play at recess together, but the differences in their learning environments are apparent, from the blue chalkboards in the boy classrooms, to the red paper hearts that decorated the wall of one of the girl's classrooms. These environments are driven by student interests and what they're learning at the time, Gilbert said. Dr. Leonard Sax, the founder of the Pennsylvania-based National Association for Single Sex Public Education, contends the movement is about breaking down gender stereotypes, not promoting them. 'We want more girls engaged in robotics and computer programming and physics and engineering,' Sax said in a telephone interview. 'We want more boys engaged in poetry and creative writing and Spanish language.' For advocates like Sax, the increase in this form of learning is exciting, but it's troubling for others. The ACLU launched a national campaign, Teach Kids, Not Stereotypes, in May and sent cease-and-desist letters to school districts in Maine, West Virginia, Alabama, Mississippi and Virginia. The group also asked state officials to investigate single-sex programs in Florida, while sending public record requests to schools in another five states, including to Gilbert's school in Idaho. Doug Bonney is legal director of the ACLU of Kansas and Western Missouri, where he successfully challenged single sex classes in Missouri's Adrian R-III School District. He argues there's no proof single-sex classrooms work while there's plenty of evidence they actually enhance gender stereotypes and lead to sexism. 'This isn't the right step to address higher dropout rates by boys,' Bonney said. 'They promote false stereotypes about sex-based differences that don't exist. Promoting sex stereotypes can harm both girls and boys.' Both sides agree the idea is not new and has a long history in private schools. But Galen Sherwin, staff attorney with the ACLU Women's Rights Project, said its history in public schools is much darker and has roots in the South, where it was broadly instituted in an effort to evade the desegregation requirements of Brown v. Board of Education to try 'to prevent black boys from being in the same room as white girls.' 'In the wake of Brown, many schools in the south integrated racially but segregated on the basis of sex,' Sherwin said. Nancy Levit, a law professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, addressed this issue at a meeting of the Association of American Law Schools: 'Think about it, in terms of race,' she said. 'What would people say if the state paid for an all-white school or an all-black school? As long as there was a racial element nobody would have a problem seeing a constitutional difficulty.' The analogy drew a heated reaction from Sax, who argues that a federal judge in Kentucky debunked this notion when ruling last year against parents who tried to block single-sex classes at a Breckenridge County school. Critics like the ACLU are out of line when they draw parallels to Brown v. Board of Education, Sax said. 'Either they're really stupid and not able to grasp what the judge is saying in the ruling, or they're being deliberately misleading,' he said.",South Carolina has more than 100 schools offering single sex classes .

This is the man police believe gunned down a wealthy Russian banker outside his executive flat. Police investigating the attempted murder have released these CCTV images of the suspect moments after German Gorbuntsov was shot a number of times as he entered his block of flats near Canary Wharf, east London, on March 20. Scotland Yard is liaising with Russian police for the first time on a major criminal inquiry since the diplomatic fallout over the death of dissident Alexander Litvinenko. Suspect: A man is caught on CCTV moments after Russian banker German Gorbuntsov was shot as he entered his block of flats near Canary Wharf . The suspect, described as white, 6ft and slim, was wearing a dark hooded top and was seen running from Byng Street away from Westferry Road, towards Marsh Wall. Detectives discovered a gun, hooded top and bag near the scene. Wealth: Property developer Gorbuntsov, amassed a fortune through stakes in six major banks in Russia and Moldova, a sports complex in Moscow and factories . Detective Chief Inspector Russell . Taylor, leading the investigation for the Metropolitan Police, said: 'We . are continuing to examine CCTV footage from the area and are keen to . speak with anyone who may have information about the shooting. 'Were you in Byng Street or nearby, shortly before or after 7.20pm on Tuesday 20 March? Did you see anyone acting suspiciously in the area? 'Did you see the man in the CCTV stills taking off a dark hooded top or leaving a bag?' Mr Gorbuntsov, 45, who was once jailed for robbery, amassed his fortune through stakes in six major banks in Russia and Moldova, a sports complex in Moscow and factories. He was also a property developer. He remains in a stable condition in hospital. No arrests have been made. Shortly before the attack Gorbuntsov had given evidence implicating his own associates in an earlier mafia-style assassination bid against Alexander Antonov, father of former Portsmouth FC owner Vladimir Antonov. The banker, who had been at a business meeting in Bishopsgate in the City earlier that evening, hailed the hackney carriage at 7pm. He had just stepped out of the car at 7.30pm when he fell in a hail of bullets. The hooded gunman, described as white, 6ft tall and slim, fled on foot. A young blonde woman, reported to be Mr Gorbuntsov’s mistress and the mother of his second child, was at his side as emergency services arrived. Mr Gorbuntsov's lawyer said the banker had been planning to submit a political asylum request to stay within days. Gun blast: German Gorbuntsov is pictured here being carried into ambulance after being shot in Canary Wharf . A successful asylum claim would have helped him fight off attempts by Moldova to extradite him on allegations of embezzlement. There was also an apparent financial wrangle with state-controlled Russian Railways, whose president is an ally of Vladimir Putin. An estimated £415million was allegedly not repaid after being deposited by the business into a Moscow bank whose ownership later passed to Mr Gorbuntsov and his associates.","German Gorbuntsov, 45, was shot several times outside his flat in Canary Wharf .

Decision: Britain's Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, pictured, says the 14 NotW staff will find out if they face charges within weeks . More than a dozen former News of the World journalists will find out by the end of this month if they face phone hacking charges, it was revealed today. Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer says he is 'reasonably confident' the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will make a final decision on the 14 suspects within weeks. Journalists arrested and bailed include former editors Andy Coulson and Rebekah Brooks, who may have directed or allowed their staff to intercept mobile phone voicemails. Former assistant editor Ian Edmondson, chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and managing editor Stuart Kuttner were also arrested as part of the Metropolitan Police's hacking operation, known as Weeting. Starmer told the Guardian today that alleged phone hacking cases would be dealt with as 'a batch' meaning that the fate of those allegedly involved will be dramatically announced on the same day this month. Any hacking charges would be the first brought since 2007. The News of the World's former royal editor Clive Goodman and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire were then jailed for four months and six months respectively for intercepting messages from members of the royal family and their staff. Prosecutors are currently using a 'broad interpretation' of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa), Starmer said, which will allow journalists to be charged with hacking even if the person had listened to the voicemail first. Probe: Former NotW staff arrested under Operation Weeting, pictured clockwise, include Rebekah Brooks, Andy Coulson, former assistant editor Ian Edmondson, and former Managing Editor Stuart Kuttner . Former Met assistant commissioner John Yates had said previously it was not clear if someone could be prosecuted if a message had already been played back. Starmer also told the Guardian that alternative charges would also be considered 'in so far as it was necessary,' including conspiring to intercept communications and computer hacking. He added that the 'public interest' test was being applied to every case. If the person allegedly being hacked had acted with 'serious hypocrisy', like having an affair for example, this will also be considered, he said. Former News of the World editor Mrs Brooks, her husband Charlie Brooks, and four others have already been charged by the CPS with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Arrests: Around 14 former NotW staff have been bailed by the Met . Brooks edited the News of the World and the Sun before becoming chief executive of parent company News International in 2009. Public furore erupted in July last year after it was reported that a private detective working for the News of the World, when Brooks was the editor, had hacked the mobile phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler. The News International boss quit her post on July 15 2011. Two days later Scotland Yard detectives arrested her. Mrs Brooks faces three charges of conspiring to pervert the course of justice, the maximum sentence for which is life imprisonment. She is accused of removing boxes of material from the News International archive and allegedly trying to conceal documents, computers and other items from Operation Weeting, Scotland Yard’s inquiry into phone hacking. A further 33 people have been arrested under Operation Elveden, the Metropolitan Police investigation into alleged corrupt payments to public officials. The investigation is being run alongside Operation Weeting.","Director of Public Prosecutions Keir Starmer says all the suspects will be dealt with in 'a batch'

A bag of clothes found on Sunday belongs to the girl who has been missing in California for almost a week, police said. Pants and a shirt were found in a Juicy bag, which she carried to school, a few miles from Sierra LaMar's home. Relatives confirmed them as belongings of the 15-year-old. Sgt Jose Cardozza of the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s office in California was unable to say whether they were the same clothes Miss LaMar had been wearing when she was last seen leaving for school on Friday morning. Scroll down for video . Growing concern: Clothes belonging to Sierra Lamar have been found after the teenager went missing almost a week ago from her home in Morgan Hill, California . Sgt Cardozza told ABC News today that police were treating the girl's disappearance as a missing person’s case. 'There is no information leading us to believe she purposely ran away,' he said. Family and friends held candlelight vigils for the missing high school student this week. The new information came to light as the father of . Sierra Lamar revealed that he is a registered sex . offender. However, Steve Lamar said he loves his daughter and had nothing to do with her disappearance last Friday. Police . frantically searching for the teen have been questioning her . classmates and teachers after an examination of her phone, which was . discovered a mile from her bus stop, gave no new leads. 'I . understand the stigma associated with this in my background, and I . assure everyone it is not connected in any way to my daughter's . disappearance,' Steve Lamar said in a statement to the San Fransisco . Chronicle. Mystery: Sierra Lamar, 15, disappeared on the walk to her school's bus stop last Friday morning in Morgan Hill, California . According to court records, he was charged in March 2009 with 12 felony counts of committing lewd or lascivious acts with three children younger than 14. In September 2009, he pleaded guilty to a single charge of committing lewd or lascivious acts with a child younger than 14 and was sentenced to a year in jail, the Chronicle reported. His daughter was not one of the victims. Police have said they have spoken with Lamar and he has been fully cooperative throughout the investigation. 'Please understand, I am a dad, and I want nothing more than to find my missing daughter,' he told the newspaper. After . conducting a sweep of registered sex offenders in the area, police have . moved on to speaking with Sierra's classmates and searching Sobrato . High School, where she transferred this year, for clues. Sex offender: Here is the California sex offender registry entry for Steve Lamar, the father of Sierra . Clues: Her mother snapped this photo of her the morning she disappeared, appearing playful which followed her parents and friends' perception of nothing out of the ordinary . Deputies had suspended their search of the grounds near her home due to a lack of evidence. 'We have exhausted our search efforts in that area. We have investigators . talking to kids hoping they can lead us in the right direction as far as where . she could be. We are looking for any information period,' Sgt. Jose Cordoza told ABC News. A case of a teenage runaway or an abduction, the investigators say they still are not sure. 'I talked to Sierra on the phone Thursday night,' her father Steve LaMar told ABC News saying there was nothing out of the ordinary. 'She was happy, talking to me . about homework. She was asking me to make an appointment so she could dye her . hair. She was happy,' he said. School: On Monday, sheriffs investigators visited Miss Lamar's school of Sobrato High, suspending their ground search for interviews with her classmates and friends . Miss Lamar's mother, Marlene Lamar, who is divorced from her father but said to be equally cooperating with police, confirmed the same view about her daughter. On Sunday police discovered her cell phone a few miles from her home by its electronic ping. Its charger was found in her bedroom. Her mother had initially called it when her school reported her as not having attended classes but she found that it was turned off, prompting her to notify police that evening. Friends: Agreeing with her parents, her friends said that Miss Lamar showed no clues of running away . Without a trace: While police dogs lost her scene at her mother's driveway her cell phone was recovered Sunday in a field nearby . According to reports from the sheriff's . department her mother is the last one known to have seen her at their . home she moved into last October. She took a photo of her daughter on her cell phone before she left last Friday morning, capturing her smiling with her tongue out at the camera. That photo has been submitted to police in help of finding her. At 6am, Miss Lamar had a half-mile walk to the school bus stop ahead of her, but the bus driver claims to have never seen her, nor fellow students. Police dogs also lost her scent at the driveway of her home. Evidence: With that field close to this road, pictured, police suspect it may have been tossed there from a passing car .

'We're hoping she's alive and that's . the most important thing right now,' her mother told KTVU while saying . she doesn't believe her daughter would have run away. Her cell phone as well as her laptop are currently undergoing a forensic search. As both of her high schools circulate her picture, posting and distributing flyers, they hope her friends will have more clues toward her disappearance. Suspended: The choice to suspend their ground search was decided by a lack of evidence police said . 'I hung out with her last week and . she was happy,' her best friend Channah Foreman told KTVU. 'We . celebrated my birthday. We don't understand what's going on. It . doesn't make sense.' Authorities said there was no indication she planned to run away, unlike in the cases of most fugitive children. Her sister Danielle claimed that Miss Lamar would never abandon her loved ones, saying: 'She's always in contact with family and friends. She wouldn't leave everyone out of the loop.'

"By . Steve Doughty, Social Affairs Correspondent . Created 5:31 PM on 23rd September 2011 . Christian GP Richard Scott outside the GMC hearing in Manchester . A Christian doctor spoke of his disgust last night after he claimed he was being  put on trial for discussing his faith with a patient. Dr Richard Scott vented his fury at the General Medical Council for persisting with a misconduct tribunal even though the patient involved refused to turn up to give evidence. The 24-year-old man was un-named and the GMC even kept details of his faith secret, on the grounds of ‘patient confidentiality’. Speaking after the case was adjourned, Dr Scott, a 51-year-old GP, said: ‘I’m actually not only disappointed, I’m disgusted with my professional body. When I started in medicine, you were led to believe the GMC were there to serve both patients and doctors. That is not the case. I think there is an anti-Christian bias with the GMC.’ The Scott case is the latest in a series of incidents in which hospitals and medical authorities have been perceived as acting to suppress any expression of Christian beliefs. One case, that of a nurse ordered off the wards because she refused to take off her crucifix, is shortly to be heard at the European Court of Human Rights. Dr Scott spoke to the 24-year-old patient, described as suicidal and vulnerable, at the end of a consultation at the Bethesda Medical Centre in Margate in August last year. The practice declares its Christian orientation and informs prospective patients that they may be offered spiritual guidance as well as medical help. The GP is said to have suggested to the patient that they might discuss religion. The patient is believed to have replied ‘go for it’ and Dr Scott told him about the ‘additional help which he might derive from Jesus’ and added that he might feel better if he prayed, as the patient’s own religion did not appear to be giving him comfort. Religious practice: Dr Richard Scott with his wife Heather outside the hearing . The patient, who was seen by the GP at the Bethesda Medical Centre (pictured) in Margate, felt Dr Scott had 'belittled' his own faith . The patient’s mother, who had . recommended Dr Scott to her son, complained ‘weeks later’. The patient . himself did not complain until three months after the consultation, when . he said he had been ‘very upset’ and his own faith had been belittled. The patient did not appear at yesterday’s hearing. He has informed the . GMC it would be a ‘big inconvenience’ and he would not attend ‘for a . million pounds’. The misconduct charge could end in a . warning to Dr Scott from the GMC Investigation Committee. It could also . lead to an instruction to the GP to appear before a future fitness to . practice hearing, which in turn could strip him of his right to work as a . doctor. During the hearing, lawyers for the . professional body said the GP had ‘crossed the line’ when he discussed . his own faith with a patient. Outside, Dr Scott said the misconduct . hearing amounted to religious persecution. He added: ‘I think within . medicine a lot is science based, so secular beliefs have a very strong . voice. Other Christians in medicine and nursing have increasingly been . under attack.’ Dr Scott said he had been angered at . the complaint of the patient’s mother that he had not done anything . medical in the consultation. ‘That was shown to be a fabrication, they . should have thrown it out,’ he said. ‘At the end of it, he didn’t like what . I was saying, he called me an idiot, which is his right, and asked me . to stop. He knew this is a Christian surgery.’ Andrea Williams of the Christian Legal . Centre, which is supporting Dr Scott, said: ‘We think every GP should . be concerned by the way their professional body has acted. First of all . they pursued Dr Scott for 14 months, then they arrived at court without . the principal witness thinking they could prove their case  on hearsay.’ Paul Ozin, for the GMC, said: ‘There . is no possible question of an abusive process. The reason why attempts . were not made to obtain Patient A was because no request was made until . last Friday by those who represent Dr Scott, which was well out of the . notice period.’ The hearing was adjourned until the witness can appear.",GP is alleged to have told a patient faith in Christianity may help him overcome personal problems .

Jumping for joy: Left, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, . who was created in 1926 when Walt Disney was working for Universal; . right, Mickey Mouse, the most popular cartoon character in the World, . created by Disney in 1928 . Oswald's first appearance since his return came in 2010's ""Epic Mickey"" as the ruler of a forgotten realm. Archive director Becky Cline . said: 'We've always known about the character and loved him and wished . that we could do things with him, but he wasn't a character that . belonged to us. 'In 2006, we were over the moon when Bob Iger made (the deal).' Changing faces: Mickey Mouse has evolved a lot over the years, from his humble black and white beginnings he has become a colourful character adored by children around the World . Cline . noted that most of the drawings from Disney's early Oswald cartoons . were destroyed, thought to be due to a lack of storage when his studio . moved to a new facility in Burbank, California, in 1939. Ms Cline . said the image of Oswald comes from a box of drawings that was found in . the 1970s and has been preserved in the Disney archives for the past 40 . years. In the spring of 1928, with a series of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit proving very popular, Walt Disney asked Charles Mintz for an increase in his budget. Mintz, however, instead demanded that Walt take a 20 percent cut. As leverage, he reminded Disney that Universal owned the character, and revealed that he had already signed most of Disney's current employees to his new contract. Angrily, Disney refused the deal and returned to produce the final Oswald cartoons that he was contractually obliged to fulfil for Mintz. Disney was dismayed at the betrayal by his staff, but determined to restart from scratch and Oswald was no more. One lesson Disney learned from the experience was to thereafter always make sure that he owned all rights to the characters produced by his company. Walt Disney got the inspiration for Mickey Mouse from his old pet mouse which he used to have on his farm. In 1925, Hugh Harman drew some sketches of mice around a photograph taken by Walt Disney. These inspired animator Ub Iwerks to create a new mouse character for Disney. 'Mortimer Mouse' had been Disney's original name for the character before his wife, Lillian, convinced him to change it, and ultimately Mickey Mouse came to be. Archivists at Disney dusted off the rough 1928 drawing of Oswald for a new exhibition showcased this month where they unveiled their new video game entitled 'Disney Epic 2: The Power of Two.' The upcoming adventure game for the Wii, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 allows players to control both Mickey and Oswald.

This week’s heavy rain has not put an end to the drought gripping swathes of the country, the Environment Agency said today. While the April showers across England and Wales will have been welcomed by farmers and gardeners, who were hit with a hosepipe ban earlier this month, the rain has to make the soil fully wet before it can start to recharge supplies. The worst of the drought has been centred in the south of the country - but further north, residents in York faced a wet walk to work as the River Ouse burst its banks this morning. Call this a drought? A damp commute to work along York's River Ouse, which has bursts its banks in the centre of the city, after days of torrential rain and more heavy showers forecast over the weekend . Nice weather for ducks: Canada geese paddle along the swollen Ouse, which burst its banks despite parts of Yorkshire being in an official state of drought . In the capital, meanwhile, stormy conditions last night caused chaos after a rush hour lightning strike saw many trains cancelled. Services in and out of Victoria station were the worst affected after the strike at south Wandsworth, near the central London transport hub, caused a fire that badly damaged a substation, leading to a power failure and serious signalling problems. All Southeastern services were suspended last night and some services into London saw minor delays this morning. The wet weather in the past week means that the North East and Anglian regions have already had more than 90 per cent of the average annual rainfall for April, while the South East has had 60 per cent of the rain it would normally expect for the month. The Met Office predicts virtually the whole of the UK will get rain this weekend, setting the scene for a soggy London Marathon on Sunday. Runners have been told the race will start amid sunny intervals, but they can expect to be drenched in the afternoon. Drenched: Murky waters overflow in York as the UK looks ahead to a weekend of yet more wet weather . Downpour: A bus kicks up rainwater from an overflowing gutter in London's Victoria Street yesterday . Welly weather: Despite a torrential downpour in Manchester, fashion came first for some . Even still, groundwater levels are similar to what they were last week, and many river levels remain below normal. There are reports the River Wylye in Wiltshire and a brook at Pixley, in Herefordshire, are drying up. In its latest update on the drought, the Environment Agency said rainfall was only likely to replenish groundwater supplies if there were large amounts of steady rain in the next month or two - the chances of which were 'very slim'. As the UK moves into summer, most rainfall is taken up by growing plants. More areas slid into drought this week, with 17 counties in the Midlands and South West now officially in a state of drought, and the Environment Agency warned the situation could last until Christmas or beyond. Rush hour: Commuters are helped off a train by rail staff in Wandsworth, South London, after a lightning strike caused a power failure at 17.20pm last night . While it lasts: Sisters Isabella and Lola Ward, aged four and two, make the most of a rare break in the April showers as they pick tulips near Kings Lynn, Norfolk . Before the rain: The Ward sisters enjoy a few hours of sunshine in Britain's last remaining bulbfields, near the village of Narborough. Sunny spells will be few and far between this weekend . Last rays: the sun shines over a rapeseed field near Ratcliffe on Soar power station, Nottinghamshire . At long last: Bluebells bloom late in West Wood near Marlborough, Wiltshire, after drought conditions hit across the country . Quenched: Late-blooming bluebells crop up after dry conditions that have seen southern gardeners and farmers frustrated by hosepipe bans . And heavy rain could lead to flash . flooding, as dry soils do not absorb the water easily, so it runs off . and causes floods, the agency has warned. Polly . Chancellor, national drought co-ordinator for the Environment Agency, . said: 'While we’ve had some welcome rain this week, the environmental . drought affecting large parts of England could last until Christmas.

She . added: 'We are working with businesses, farmers and water companies to . plan ahead to meet the challenges of a continued drought.'

The widow of Lt Col Herbert Jones has spoken out on the 30th anniversary of the Argentine Falklands invasion, saying 'I hope we would do it all again.' Sara Jones's husband, known as 'H', died leading a charge against an Argentine machine gun post at Goose Green while commanding 2 Battalion, the Parachute Regiment. Mrs Jones, 70, said: 'We stood up for what we believed in. We didn’t like to see a small country overrun by somebody who had very little claim to it.' She said: 'The islanders have always been fiercely British and want to stay that way. I would like to believe that we would, if we could, do it again.'

'You can believe in fair choice or you believe in coercion,' he said. Meanwhile, . Shadow Defence Secretary Jim Murphy said in a statement: 'This month . the country and all political parties will be united in remembrance.

A Muslim faith school has revealed that less than one per cent of its pupils class English as their main language. Of the 630 youngsters at Iqra Slough Islamic Primary School in Berkshire, just ten are non-Muslim and more than 99 per cent class English as an 'additional' language. The school had faced educational meltdown 18 months ago after a bad Ofsted report, but is now 'making good progress', as bosses have claimed that 'faith has paid off'. Faith school: A massive 99% of pupils at The IQRA Islamic School in Slough, Berkshire, class English as an additional language . The school's board of governors' chairman, Zafar Ali, said he hoped their improving Ofsted results would see more parents of non-Muslim children put their names down to attend. Iqra Slough Islamic Primary is thought to have one of the lowest proportion of English-speaking students in the country. In Bradford, a similar picture is painted at Bradford Moor Community School, where less than one per cent of pupils speak English as their first language. Across the same Yorkshire city, just 26 of 700 students at Byron Primary School in Bradford speak English as their first language. The school faced educational meltdown 18 months ago after Ofsted gave it poor marks following an inspection. In a bid to beat the 'problem school' label, it went into the 'special measures' category in 2010 and the local education authority tried to sack the entire board of governors and replace them with an Interim Executive Board. But Education Secretary Michael Gove refused to let this happen and backed the governors once he had assessed the evidence. Headteacher Gareth Thomas was recruited 18 months ago and some teachers were allowed to leave. Ofsted inspectors visited the school on March 14th and sat in on 30 lessons involving 24 teachers. Pupils celebrate the achievements of IQRA Islamic Primary School, which received an improved Ofsted report recently . In their new report they say 'From children’s low starting point in reception they are now making good progress. The progress accelerates as they move through the school.' However the report warned 'The school is not outstanding as a result of some remaining inconsistencies in teaching and pupils’ attainment, particularly in reading and mathematics.' The school, sponsored by the Loughborough Trust, emerged from special measures in March and is set to become an academy this year. Mr Ali said 'This is a wonderful report. We were confident we would prove to everybody that this is a good school with a sound future. 'Perhaps we can now nail the myth that Muslim schools are subversive religious madrasas in disguise. We are a good school with superb teachers, and parents have put their faith in us.

"By . Rob Waugh . UPDATED: . 06:37 EST, 1 February 2012 . Facebook is expected to begin the process of becoming a public company today, according to reports. The social network is expected to raise $10billion in the most hotly anticipated technology IPO in a decade, a figures that would dwarf Google's $1.9billion initial public offering in 2004. On that amount the company would be valued at $75billion to $100billion vaulting it into the ranks of the largest public companies in the world, on par with the likes of McDonald's, Amazon.com and Visa. While Facebook has refused to confirm the IPO, regular investors and IPO specialists are anticipating some kind of twist - perhaps a . provision for the 800million users of Facebook to get in on the action. Like: Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's net worth is $17.5billion and he owns 24 per cent of the social network, previously worth $5.3billion . Facebook CEO and founder . Mark Zuckerberg, 27, is anything but a conformist. He turns up at . business conventions in a hoodie and famously spurned a $15billion takeover offer from Microsoft. 'Pandemonium is what I expect in . terms of demand for this stock,' said Scott Sweet, senior managing . partner at IPO Boutique, an advisory firm. 'I don't think Wall Street would want to anger Facebook users.' An initial public offering is the launch of a company on the stock market where shares in the company are offered for the first time, resulting in a share price being set and the company being valued. After filing its initial paperwork, a public offering usually takes three to four months. The Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter, said that the social-networking company could raise as much as $10 billion in an offering that would value the company at $75 billion to $100 billion. Either measure would dwarf the $1.9 billion raised in Google's 2004 IPO. That offering gave Google a market value of $23 billion. Google is now worth $184 billion. Zuckerberg is already considered a billionaire because of shares traded on a closed market. Facebook spokesman Larry Wu said the company will not comment on IPO-related speculation.

ROLE: Claimed they invented Facebook which was stolen by Mr Zuckerberg . For the state of California it can't come soon enough. The fiscally challenged state expects a tax windfall after the IPO. In 2006, two years after Google went . public, 16 Google insiders paid the state $380million in taxes after . cashing in 9 million shares - enough to cover the salaries of more than . 3,000 state workers. When a company goes public stockholders can't sell the shares right away, so takes a little while for the tax income to flow in. The main reason for an IPO is to produce a profit . for the company, adding to Mr Zuckerberg’s already estimated net worth . of $17.5 billion with the expected sale of the company's securities. At $100 billion valuation, the company . started by Zuckerberg in a Harvard dorm room would have double the . valuation of Hewlett-Packard, the Journal said. Facebook's IPO would dwarf that of any other dotcom waiting to go public. 'Farmville' creator Zynga has filed for an IPO of up to $1 billion.

Tragic: The corpse of Sian Rees, pictured, was found in the van of her partner John Doyle following a road accident and it is alleged she was strapped into the passenger seat . A property developer murdered his lover and put her in the front seat of his van to take her away to dispose of the body – only to be caught when he crashed into a hedge near their home, a court heard yesterday. John Doyle, 54, is accused of strangling and stabbing Sian Rees the night she came home after surgery for breast cancer. They had rowed over Miss Rees meeting another man on the internet when he turned up late – and drunk – to collect her from the hospital, it was alleged. The court heard that the couple’s 15-year relationship had been under strain and, using the pseudonym Sindy Sox, Miss Rees started communicating with a family lawyer online. This man had invited Miss Rees for a flight in his plane and when Doyle found out a huge row ensued, the jury was told. When he tried to dispose of the body the next morning, his van hit a traffic island and punctured a tyre. Desperate not to stop, he eventually lost control and crashed. Prosecutor Paul Dunkels QC said: ‘It quickly became apparent why the defendant was so keen not to stop and tried to carry on driving on a shredded tyre and metal rim. ‘In the front passenger seat was the body of his partner Sian Rees. She had not been injured in the car crash. Her body was cold and she had been dead for about 12 hours.’ A nurse stopped at the scene of the crash, the court heard, and found that Miss Rees was obviously dead. Doyle asked ‘Is she OK?’ When told she was dead he replied ‘Oh’, which surprised the nurse because of his ‘lack of emotion’. Exeter Crown Court was told that on the day of the murder Doyle had dropped his long-term partner off at hospital before drinking in several pubs while she was operated on under general anaesthetic. After he returned late to pick her up, it was said that despite her post-operative condition, Miss Rees drove the couple home to their converted mill house, but planned to spend the night alone at a hotel. Before she got there however, the . court heard, Doyle strangled her and then loaded her body into the . passenger seat of his Ford Fiesta van. He crashed the next day. Investigation: Police survey the scene in Hatherleigh, Devon where the strangled body of Sian Rees was found dead last year . The court heard the couple had also argued about Miss . Rees’s weight and Doyle’s apparent lack of progress in renovating their . remote property, Merton Mill, near Hatherleigh in Devon. Mr Dunkels said: ‘The defendant was to renovate it while Sian Rees brought in the income.’ But problems arose, Mr Dunkels said, . because she felt he was not getting on with the renovation and he did . not like the fact that she had put on a ‘considerable amount of weight’. Miss Rees, confided to a friend that . the couple were not ‘making each other happy any more’ and that she was . ‘sick of living on a building site’. Two days before she was killed, Miss Rees told her secretary that she wanted to ‘start a new life without him’. At the same time that their relationship hit the rocks, she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. Close-up: Partner John Doyle was driving with one slashed tyre when he crashed his van here. A passing nurse then saw him pulling the body from his car . The court heard that after they . arrived home from the surgery, a row must have flared in the kitchen . where, it is alleged, Doyle stabbed her with a four inch knife and may . have used a leather bra to throttle her before strangling her with ‘his . bare hands’. The next morning Doyle set off with the body, knife and bra in his van. ‘It is not clear where he would end . up or what he was going to do’, Mr Dunkels continued. ‘He knew one . thing, he had to try and get rid of the body of the woman he had . murdered.’ A post mortem examination revealed Miss Rees died from compression of the neck and her voice box had been fractured. Doyle, who denies murder, told police . in a statement that Miss Rees had ‘ranted’ at him on the trip from the . hospital because he was late and drunk. At the mill he said his memory was ‘hazy’ but said his lover said she felt ‘old and unattractive’ and was upset. He claimed she grabbed the kitchen knife and as he took it from her, she was stabbed in the stomach. The trial continues.","Sian Rees had an operation on the day before she was killed .

Painful memories: Punk legend Lydon said the four-year ordeal, which began when he was just seven, was 'tortuous' Former Sex Pistol John Lydon has spoken candidly about how a severe bout of childhood meningitis left him unable to recognise his own parents. The punk rock legend admitted that the four-year ordeal, which began when he was just seven and living in London, was 'cruel and tortuous', as he believed it was all his own fault. Lydon said he was incapable of remembering his own name, let alone the identity of his parents, John Christopher and Eileen, but decided he had to trust them because he had 'no place else to go'. In tonight's revealing interview with Sky Arts: In Confidence, Lydon will discuss his dizzying success with the Pistols and the breakdown of the band, along with new tidbits about his fascinating personal life. 'Not being able to remember your own name . or your mother and father, or anything at all, and for little bits of . that to be coming in over a period of four years, that's pretty close to . torture,' he tells interviewer Laurie Taylor. The 56-year-old added: 'I had to believe these were my mum and . dad. They were kind. They seemed to want me. 'The hospital did not seem . to want me. I had no place else to go. But it was murderously cruel and . tortuous, mostly because I thought inside it must be my fault. I must . have done something wrong.' Lydon, now frontman for band Public Image Ltd, has moved from anarchist figurehead of the seventies to being seen in reality TV show I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here and appearing in butter adverts. The Pistols' 1977 anti-monarchy . anthem God Save the Queen is being re-released this year for the second . time on a major label to coincide with the Queen's . Diamond Jubilee.

Lydon also speaks openly about the . death of his stepdaughter, Arianna Foster - aka Ari Up, a member of the . all-female punk band The Slits. He said of Foster, who died in . 2010 from cancer: 'Arianna didn't need to die and that's a . very, very tough burden on her mother to know that.

'If you want to survive something as curable as breast cancer, do not go . to the far-out loonies. But, ultimately, those are decisions Arianna . made herself and some of us in the family think it was almost suicide.' Lydon formed the Pistols in 1975 and kick-started the punk rock movement in Britain. Despite releasing only one album and four singles, The Sex Pistols are regarded as one of the most influential bands of all time. They disbanded after a shambolic US tour in January 1978 and Lydon went on to form Public Image Ltd (PiL). Lydon says he turned TV butter salesman so PiL could tour again. 'The money that came out [of the butter advert]... not an enormous amount, you know, and certainly not one to complement the 87 per cent increase in their sales – you owe me more – but [it was] enough to get PiL started up again and get some debt off my back.

The Prime Minister’s anti-poverty tsar has accused David Cameron of wasting the first half of his term in government by ignoring a study into how to smash the cycle of deprivation. Frank Field said Mr Cameron had squandered two years by failing to implement any of his suggestions. The former welfare minister said the Prime Minister ‘has yet to show he has even read’ the study he commissioned into bridging the class divide for youngsters. Pleading poverty: Former welfare minister Frank Field (left) said David Cameron (right) had 'missed an opportunity' The maverick Labour MP called for a dedicated Cabinet Minister to take charge of all policy for the under-fives, saying so far the coalition had failed. The government’s dithering had led to a ‘lost opportunity’ to ensure that children from low income families did not go on to fail at school. Mr Field’s ground-breaking study, commissioned by Mr Cameron, warned that children’s life chances were almost entirely determined before they even got to school. His report called for health visitors to measure children’s behaviour and communication skills from the age of two to catch youngsters who were falling behind in their development. The MP for Birkenhead also called for . parenting classes to be offered in schools.So far, however, his . suggestions had only been taken seriously by a few keen civil servants, . he said. Mr Field told the Daily Mail: ‘This . is a missed opportunity. I am puzzled as to why the Prime Minister would . be so anxious for me to do all this work when he has yet to show that . he has read it. Living on the breadline: The government's dithering had led to a 'lost opportunity' to ensure that children from low income families did not go on to fail at school . ‘Time is running out, we are coming up to halfway in this parliament. ‘If the Prime Minister had hit the ground running from day one two years ago, they [the coalition] could have said, ‘we may have made a mess of things in these other areas but at least we are trying really hard on this’. ‘ . He added: ‘This report was about giving the Prime Minister a flagship policy which would have taken politics into a new era. He needs to get on with it. ‘It would have raised voters’ morale, so they could have felt that despite all this mess, we know they are sorting out life chances and they are on the right track.’. Downing Street dismissed the criticism, saying the Prime Minister took tackling poverty very seriously. A source close to Mr Cameron said: ‘Of course the Prime Minister is committed to trying to reduce poverty. This Budget was about taking many of the poorest people out of tax altogether. A lot of the Queen’s Speech will also be focused on the family.’ 'Time is running out, we are coming up to halfway in this parliament' Mr Field’s paper ‘The Foundation Years: preventing poor children becoming poor adults’ revealed that many children begin school without knowing their first name because their parents barely speak to them. One of his most damning findings was that youngsters who were behind when they started school never caught up to their peers. He blamed the situation on the low aspirations of parents trapped in poverty where no one in the family has worked for generations. These parents do not bother to play with, talk to or read to their children. Education experts also blamed the arrival of the internet which they say has contributed to a fall in verbal communication in many households. The government is expected to miss its target, of ensuring that no more than 1.7 million children live in poverty. This is despite successive governments spending £150 billion on tackling poverty since 1997. Child poverty is also measured against median earnings and the recession should have made the problem easier to mask, Mr Field said. The former minister argued for poverty to be measured against other indicators such as parenting and the quality of childcare rather than just income. He said that the Labour policy of ‘income transfers on a massive scale did not work’. When his report was published in December 2010, it was welcomed by the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg as a ‘hugely valuable contribution’ to the coalition Government’s drive to end child poverty by 2020.","Former welfare minister accused David Cameron of squandering two years .

"By . Anthony Bond . UPDATED: . 16:21 EST, 30 March 2012 . The owners of a luxury canine hotel were banned from keeping animals today after a dog died from being neglected and starved while in their care. Collie-cross Izzie died 11 days after checking into Burlington Green Acres in Somerset - described as a 'loving home from home' run by Bernadette and Nicholas Fitzgerald-Roberts. The nine-year-old pet collapsed with convulsions and suffered from an open wound infested with maggots. Neglected: The owners of Burlington Green Acres hotel were banned from keeping animals today following the death of Izzie, pictured here with her owner David Phelps . Tests found the pet had not eaten for at least 24 hours and had been in a poor condition for up to three days before her death. Mrs Fitzgerald-Roberts, 48, and her 47-year-old husband each admitted two charges under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 at Taunton Deane Magistrates Court in Somerset. Mr Fitzgerald-Roberts was banned from looking after or keeping animals for 12 months while his wife was prohibited for six months. Their kennel licence was also suspended for six months. Izzie’s owners, David and Lesley Phelps, of Hemyock, Devon, had specially chosen the hotel in Somerset because of its ‘luxury’ claims. Speaking after an earlier hearing, Mr Phelps said: 'We feel the Fitzgerald-Roberts have let us and Izzie down. 'Nothing will bring Izzie back. She was part of the family and went everywhere with us. Full of life: After 11 days at Burlington Green Acres in Somerset Izzie collapsed with convulsions and was found to be suffering from an open wound infested with maggots . Banned: Bernadette and Nicholas Fitzgerald-Roberts each admitted two charges under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 at Taunton Deane Magistrates Court in Somerset today . 'One of the main reasons we chose Burlington Green Acres was their assurance that they were able to give individual attention to the dogs. 'If anything positive can come of this we hope the authorities introduce frequent checks on kennels and catteries to ensure standards of animal welfare.' The court was previously told how Mr and Mrs Phelps dropped off Izzie at the dog hotel on July 25 last year, expecting to pick her up on August 14 when they returned from a holiday. But Izzie collapsed 11 days later on August 5 was rushed to the vet unconscious, soaking wet and with a weak pulse. Vet Nicola Newman discovered she had an open wound, infested with maggots, on her hindquarters, and had not eaten for 24 hours. Izzie was wrapped in blankets but began appearing to convulse a couple of hours later. She passed away just half an hour later, at 2.30pm. The vet immediately reported the case to the RSPCA, sparking an investigation. Trusted: Mr and Mrs Phelps left their Collie-cross Izzie at Burlington Green Acres, pictured, which promises to be a 'home from home' for pets while their owners are away . In a statement read to an earlier hearing, Nicola Newman said: 'Izzie’s condition should have been noticed in the two or three days before her death. 'She suffered and died unnecessarily.' Neil Scott, prosecuting, said: 'This is a case of neglect, not cruelty. The offenders were in a position of special responsibility.' Mrs Fitzgerald-Roberts, of Upper Cheddon, near Taunton, Somerset, was responsible for overall supervision as the kennels’ owner, the hearing was told. Her husband, of Brixham, Devon, carried out the daily care of animals at the £14 a night dog hotel. On its website, Burlington Green Acres claims to be a 'loving home from home' for dogs, with centrally heated rooms purpose built onto the house. This means the 'dogs get a home not a kennel', according to the site, which also boasts that the centre is set in 'acres of land'. It adds: 'Our staff offer a quality and reliable service you can count on and relax safe in the knowledge your dog is being looked after and is happy.' In mitigation, Ian Denley, for Mr Fitzgerald-Roberts, said Izzie’s long hair made it hard to spot the wound and maggots. Guy Adams, for Mrs Fitzgerald-Roberts added: 'She failed to adequately supervise her husband, who had training and experience looking after dogs.' On top of his animal ban, Mr Fitzgerald-Roberts also received a 12-month community order, with a 150 hours unpaid work requirement, and fined £1,847. Burlington Green Acres will have its licence revoked for six months but Mr Adams asked for 28 days grace for the animals to be removed from the sanctuary.","Collie-cross Izzie died 11 days after checking into Burlington Green Acres .

David Cameron was embroiled in a fresh row over his local hunt yesterday after the RSPCA launched an unprecedented prosecution for unlawful foxhunting. The animal charity is already taking action against one member of the Heythrop hunt, which the Prime Minister has ridden with and which is popular with fellow members of the so-called Chipping Norton Set in the Cotswolds. But now it has laid fresh charges against the hunt and four of its members – provoking accusations that the charity’s actions are ‘politically motivated’. The four accused of unlawfully hunting a fox with dogs in contravention of the Hunting Act 2004 are Vanessa Lambert, 29, who is a Joint Master of  the hunt, Richard Sumner, 67, Duncan Hume, 32, and 48-year-old Julian Barnfield, a professional huntsman. The Mail on Sunday revealed last August that Mr Barnfield was already facing two counts of unlawfully hunting a fox. That case is due to be heard by magistrates later this year. The new charges have shocked the Heythrop’s supporters, who include Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of News International, her racehorse trainer husband Charlie Brooks, and Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson, who has allowed the hunt to ride on his land. Critics have questioned how the charity can afford such a move – pro-hunt campaigners believe the case could cost up to £1 million in legal fees – at  a time when it is planning to make staff redundant. Ms Lambert said last night that all four defendants would deny the allegations when the case comes before magistrates in Banbury, Oxfordshire, on June 1. She said: ‘The rural community is amazed that the RSPCA has the staffing, the money and the time to pursue what is clearly a politically motivated campaign against a hunt which  operates within David Cameron’s community.’ The RSPCA last night confirmed it had laid charges against both the hunt and the four named individuals following a ‘careful examination’ of the evidence. But a spokeswoman declined to comment on claims that its actions had a political agenda. She said: ‘While proceedings are active in this matter, we cannot comment further.’ Hunt supporters: Rebekah Brooks, left, and Jeremy Clarkson, right, are both part of the Chipping Norton set . Allegations: Professional huntsman Julian Barnfield (pictured) is one of four accused of unlawfully hunting a fox with dogs in contravention of the Hunting Act 2004 . Apart from his personal  connections with the hunt,  which he rode with in 2003,  Mr Cameron could find the legal action politically sensitive. The Coalition has promised to hold a free vote in Parliament on the hunting ban introduced by Labour in 2004. Since the law came into force in February 2005, there have been only five successful prosecutions involving more than  300 registered hunts in England and Wales, leading to eight individual convictions. Seven other prosecutions have failed and a verdict is due in one further case involving the Crawley and Horsham hunt in Sussex later this month. According to pro-hunt campaigners, the RSPCA’s decision to step up its offensive suggests that there are internal tensions in the anti-hunting movement. The League Against Cruel Sports had been taking the lead on prosecutions and the RSPCA appears to have been pressurised by its own ruling council to follow suit, following criticism that it was not adopting a sufficiently firm approach. Steeped in tradition: Mr Cameron has spent time with the Heythrop hunt (some members pictured here at Blenheim Palace in 1999) RSPCA council members include Dr Richard Ryder, who was director of the Political Animal Lobby which donated £1 million to the Labour Party before the 1997 General Election. The RSPCA is currently consulting on 130 redundancies because of a serious financial shortfall. A spokesman for the Countryside Alliance said: ‘The RSPCA’s decision to bring such a huge prosecution is a blatant political attack on hunting and an abuse of the court system. ‘It is no accident that the RSPCA, which was a major  part of the campaign to ban hunting, only brings private prosecutions against hunts in the Prime Minister’s constituency. We believe that these allegations, like 99 per cent of those made about hunts, are groundless and we are confident that the prosecution  will fail.’ In a newspaper article in 2003, Mr Cameron recalled a day he spent with the Heythrop hunt. ‘Nothing had prepared me for the sheer terror of a day’s hunting,’ he wrote. ‘I battled in vain to control  my powerful steed and careered through trees and bushes – completely out of control.’","David Cameron embroiled in fresh row over his local hunt .

"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson . PUBLISHED: . 08:23 EST, 21 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:41 EST, 21 March 2012 . The 50p tax rate for high earners will be cut in 2013 to 45p and again, finances permitting, to 40p in 2014 . The controversial 50p tax rate for people earning more than £150,000 will be scrapped, George Osborne announced today. The cut will affect just 328,000 people and is expected to cost the government somewhere in the region of £400million. It means top earners will now pay 45p in tax for each pound they earn over £150,000. When Labour introduced the tax it was expected to raise £3bn for the Treasury but it has in fact raised just one-third of the forecast figure. Outlining the Budget for the next . year, Mr Osborne said the cut would be financed by changes in stamp . duty, the general anti-avoidance tax rule and a 'tycoon tax'. Mr Osborne said: 'No Chancellor can justify a tax rate that damages our economy and raises next to nothing. It is as simple as that. 'And thanks to the other new taxes on the rich I've announced today, we'll be getting five times more money each and every year from the wealthiest in our society. 'So the richest pay more. The economy benefits. Britain is competitive again.' Mr Miliband told Mr Osborne that voters would wonder which planet he and Prime Minister David Cameron are on. The Labour leader also challenged Cabinet ministers to raise their hands if they would personally benefit from cutting the 50p tax rate. Quoting back one of the Government's favourite mantras to promote transparency, he urged them: 'Sunlight is the best disinfectant. 'Just nod if you're going to benefit from it, or shake your head if you're not. Come on, we've got plenty of time.' How much higher rate earners will pay under the 45p rate compared with the 50p rate . He said the Chancellor's 'driving ambitions' for the Budget were 'to deliver a tax cut for people earning over £150,000'. Mr Miliband added: 'How can the priority for our country be an income tax cut for the richest 1 per cent at a time when the squeezed middle are facing rising petrol prices, higher energy bills and tax credits and child benefit being cut? 'Think of what you could have done with the money.' Mr Miliband said Mr Osborne's growth plan had failed, adding: 'Unemployment is rising month upon month upon month. You promised us last year the deficit would be gone by the end of the Parliament, but today you admit you're borrowing over £150billion more than you said you would.' Dominic Swords from Henley Business School said: 'Unwinding that 50p down to 45p will have a bigger cost to total tax than he is expecting. Clearly it's a political decision that he's taken to be seen as the champion of enterprise. 'The net effect of the economics of it is a Robin Hood who is taking from the very wealthy to give to the quite wealthy.' The changes to stamp duty, which is a new 7per cent rate on homes worth more than £2m, will raise something like £500m alone. The . government has insisted that it was essential to slash the top rate in . order to build an enterprising economy, attract foreign investment and . generate growth. Ahead . of today's Budget, insiders said he believes there is a brief ‘window of . opportunity’ to ditch the tax before the election run-in. George Osborne outlined changes to the 50p tax rate today which had met with some resistance from Lib Dem coalition colleagues such as Simon Hughes who said the issue was not one of his party's priorities . The 50p tax, brought in by Labour, raised just a few hundred million pounds rather than the £2.5billion initially estimated. According to an ITV News-ComRes poll before today's Budget, 46 per cent of people were against the cutting of the 50p top tax rate while 31 per cent were in favour. The coalition have in recent days comes to an agreement over slashing to top rate, with the Lib Dems supporting it, as long as it came hand-in-hand with other measures to ensure the rich paid more tax. Simon Hughes, deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, told the BBC on Monday that the issue was not one of the his party's priorities. 'We have our priority to make sure people at the top end of the income scale pay more and our priority is not to take tax rates down from the top,' he said. 'Our manifesto promise with which we went to the country was to lift people out of tax at the bottom by closing loopholes at the top. 'We did not say hang on to the 50p tax rate, or have a top tax rate at anything else.' Tax take: The chart above shows how individuals tax bills rise with their income. The bottom line is on current tax bands, while the top is inflation-adjusted with late 1970s tax bands . The Chancellor had faced continued unease from his . own benches over the cut in the tax rate which they believe is an . inefficient means of generating revenue. Backbencher . Jesse Norman said: 'I do think that the possibility of cutting the top . rate is a concern. I don't think people will understand that this is . being done in order to raise more money. 'The . idea I don't think is going to get across without an enormous amount of . communication,' he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One yesterday. Labour described the cut in the 50p rate as a 'wrong priority' that demonstrated 'just how out of touch this Government is'.","Rate for high earners will fall to 45p in 2013 .

Creaking under the weight of chronic debt and uncertainty, Spain may not conjure visions of carefree fun and all-night parties. But salvation may be on its way... in the shape of a Las Vegas-esque vice city, that developers say will boost its flat-lining economy. Dubbed 'EuroVegas', it will house six casinos, 12 hotels, nine theatres and three golf courses, if America's eighth richest man gets his way. Sheldon Adelson, however, says he will only go ahead if Spain bends its rules on indoor smoking and caps on soaring skyscrapers. Spain's savior? America's eighth richest man, tycoon Sheldon Adelson, is laying plans to pump $22 billion into the complex in either Barcelona or Madrid . Adelson is laying plans to pump $22 billion into the complex, in Barcelona or Madrid. And his money could be just what Spain needs with its shrinking economy and rising unemployment figures. Not everyone is thrilled about the idea of Spain hosting a European Sin City that could attract prostitution and mafia gangs - and add gambling addiction to the woes of already desperate Spaniards. Pedigree: Adelson already owns the Venetian Macao Resort Hotel is shown in Macau . Still, Madrid and Barcelona are both vying to woo Adelson and the $22 billion he wants to invest to erect 'Eurovegas' - an array of six casinos, 12 hotels featuring 36,000 rooms, a convention center, three golf courses, shopping centers, bars and restaurants. The two sites being eyed in Madrid each cover an area equivalent to 1,000 football fields. Adelson and his company, Las Vegas Sands Corp., will decide by the summer which city to build in if they reach a deal with Spanish authorities. The country's jobless rate is around 23 per cent - nearly 50 percent among those under age 25 - and the economy is forecast to shrink by 1.7 per cent this year. First-quarter GDP numbers are expected to show Spain has slipped into its second recession in three years. Not on our doorstep! An anti-Eurovegas association held a rally in Madrid last week in which Adelson was mocked as an economic messiah, his pockets overflowing with dollars . 'At a time like this, with so little to boost the economy, something like this is like manna falling from heaven,' said Gayle Allard, an economist who specializes in labor market issues at IE Business School in Madrid. Allard said that Spain is already a huge tourist draw, with its sunshine and great beaches, and a casino complex would build on those assets. Spain is regularly one of the world's three most visited countries, along with the United States and France. Critics argue Eurovegas will bring more criminality to Spain just as the economy goes into a nose-dive. And they warn that while Spain's young people are in dire need of jobs, positions such as hotel maids, waiters and croupiers are not a recipe for success. Adelson started looking at Spain as a possible site for a European gambling magnet in 2007, but his propsals fell flat with the then-ruling Socialist Party. But since the more business-friendly Popular Party took power, along with the downturn, Adelson's plans are said to be back on track. Gambling is legal in Spain. But its casinos, and others in Europe, are associated with a more snooty clientele and ambiance, not the festive, anything-goes atmosphere of Vegas. 'There is no one place in Europe that is fun to go to and play the slots or play tables or have a good time with an adult couple or family,' Adelson said in a meeting with investors in New York last September. The hotels and casinos and all the rest would be built in three phases over the course of 10 years. Adelson says the project would create 260,000 jobs, 190,000 of them directly. Las Vegas Sands Corp. surpassed Caesars Entertainment Corp. last year as the world's largest gaming corporation, posting profits of $1.27 billion in 2011. Sands operates properties in Las Vegas, Macau and Singapore. Gaming investors have sniffed out Spain before. A few years ago, Harrah's Entertainment Inc. - now known as Caesars - explored the idea of building a casino complex, albeit smaller than the one being considered now, in Ciudad Real, 200 kilometers (130 miles) south of Madrid. But nothing came of it. An anti-Eurovegas association held a rally in Madrid last week in which Adelson was mocked as an economic messiah, his pockets overflowing with dollars. Juan Garcia, a spokesman for the association, said a gambling haven is no answer to Spain's crisis. 'I think a casino would be a waste of brain power and labor, and instead endorses an activity that has little do with research, innovation and development,' Garcia said.","Six casinos, 12 hotels, 9 theatres and 3 golf courses in 'economy-boosting' plan .

A full dress rehearsal for the London 2012 Olympics torch relay got under way today - but only handfuls of people turned out to watch the spectacle and there wasn't even a flame on the torch. Some 122 participants from Leicestershire were acting as torchbearers during the only full operational dummy run of a single day of the relay. Torchbearer Jasmine Vanmali sets off with the torch during a rehearsal from the National Space Centre in Leicester . Whether this woman in the village Wymeswold knew the torch was passing through or if she witnessed it by chance is unknown . It's unlikely that these police bikers would be needed during the Olympic torch relay dummy-run . The actual torch relay will start from Land's End in Cornwall next month after the arrival of the Olympic flame in the UK on May 18. Today's rehearsal, taking place on the Leicester to Peterborough route, is aimed at testing timings, convoy movement, radio communications, traffic management and security. The torch will not be lit during the rehearsal, the organisers said. The actual Olympic flame will pass through 1,018 places in the UK, as well as visiting Dublin, arriving in London for the Olympic Games opening ceremony on July 27. Bearers of the flameless Olympic torch made their way along the route through Leicestershire this afternoon . Today's rehearsal kicked off at the National Space Centre in Leicester just after 7am. Each of the participants, who have been chosen from the local area to take part in today's rehearsal, will carry the torch some 300m. The participants are volunteers from local universities and organisations, but will not be taking part in the actual event. The Olympic Flame is due to pass along the route on day 46 of the torch relay. Speaking ahead of today's rehearsal, David Chaplain, a Loughborough University student, said he was excited to be taking part as one of the acting torchbearers. The 20-year-old, who is in his second year of a sports management degree, said 'I would have liked to have been involved in the real thing but I wasn't sure I was going to be in the country. This is a great opportunity to still be involved. 'It's something you take forward with you for the rest of your life.' Another student, Kayleigh Pettit, 23, who is in her final year of a physics degree at the university, said she had been nervous about dropping the torch. 'I was initially quite worried about it because of how heavy the torch was going to be and anyone I mentioned it to said 'Oh what if you dropped it', but now I've had chance to hold it, it's actually very light and easy to hold.' Sebastian Coe, chairman of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, spoke to some of the participants taking part in today's rehearsal during a handover at Loughborough University. Lord Coe, who represented the university during his time studying economics and social history there, said the day would help to ensure they were 'as close to perfection' as possible for the actual event. The Olympic gold medal-winning athlete said: 'We've got different modes of transport. We've got the torch travelling on a boat, we've got it travelling by train, we've obviously got the torchbearers themselves. Even at Loughborough University there was a lack of people on the side of the route . Lacking spark: Jasmine Vanmali passes the 'flame to Samuel Rowbottom during the test run . Security outrunners gather in Leicester. They will follow the torch in teams around the UK . Caitlin Bloom takes the torch along another empty road - hopefully the real relay will attract larger crowds . 'It was just a good way of testing it. It's like 122 mini dress rehearsals involving 12 different communities and 80 miles. 'We'll collate all the learnings of the course of the day and take them back to HQ and look at it all. This is no different from every other aspect of the Games we're testing. 'We're into 400,000 hours of technology testing, we've got 11 test events still left to do in sport. 'I've sat on the kerbstones of roads at 5.45 in the morning talking to marathon runners about the test event for the marathon. 'We just learn and refine so that we can get as close to perfection as we possibly can.' When asked about security concerns, Lord Coe said he was confident people were looking to celebrate rather than disrupt the relay. Police officers who will guard the Olympic torch as it travels across the country sit on a train at Great Central station in Leicester . Sebastian Coe turned up for part of the relay as it passed to Michael Meyerstein in Loughborough . Another couple of torch relay runners pass the imaginary flame as the torch reaches Loughborough University . Helena Scott carries the torch along a near empty platform in Leicester . He said: 'You can hear the music and the excitement in the background. This is a celebration. I'm just delighted that we've got the opportunity to take the torch to within 10 miles of 57 million people. 'I don't believe that there is any appetite to do anything other than really want to celebrate the torch relay.' From the university, the rehearsal team was due to travel through Melton Mowbray, Langham and Oakham in Rutland. At Rutland Water, a torchbearer will be carried across the water on a rigid inflatable boat (RIB) to hand over the torch to a participant on another boat. From there, the party will travel on to Uppingham and Stamford before torchbearers board another steam train on the Nene Valley Railway to Orton Mere station to end the day in Peterborough.","Real Olympic torch will arrive at Land's End in Cornwall on May 18 .

England needs a rousing national anthem of its own to help restore pride in the country, say campaigners. They have written to the Prime Minister recommending a popular vote to pick a song such as Jerusalem or Land of Hope and Glory to be used at sporting and national events instead of God Save The Queen. MPs and academics claim that treating the anthem as if it belongs to England ‘undermines an equal claim to British identity and the allegiance of other nations within the United Kingdom’. Flying the flag: Football fans show patriotic side at 2010 World Cup . They say: ‘When British athletes win gold for Team GB at the London 2012 Olympics, God Save The Queen will play to celebrate. 'However, when it is England who take to the sporting field to play rugby or football, they should be heralded by an English anthem for an English team, just as Flower Of Scotland and Land Of My Fathers are sung as Scottish and Welsh anthems.’ The campaign is launched today, St George’s Day, after a poll showed the English feel more aligned to the Union Flag than the Cross of St George. Just under a quarter consider the red cross on a white background to be racist because of its association with extreme Right-wing groups. Pride: Think thank says Scotland's civic leaders like Alex Salmond have done more to counter 'exclusive versions of national identity' While 80 per cent of those questioned linked the British flag to patriotic feelings, only 61 per cent associated such emotions with the English flag. The Welsh and Scots, in contrast, were far more likely to feel pride in their flags of Y Ddraig Goch, the Red Dragon, and St Andrew’s Cross. The survey, carried out by YouGov for . the think tank British Future, analysed how 2,600 respondents throughout . the UK viewed their national identity. British Future says the results show more must be done to promote ‘English patriotism’ if the Union of countries is to continue. Flagging behind: Prime Ministers have flown the flag above 10 Downing Street but politicians have been blamed for not doing enough . The think tank report, This Sceptred Isle, blames the ‘extreme street hooligans of the English Defence League’ for ‘toxifying’ the St George’s Cross, although it also criticises politicians for not speaking up ‘for inclusive patriotism of the English majority’. Despite continued pride in the Union Flag, the report concludes that English anxiety over its own flag could damage the Union. It states: ‘England, the land of Shakespeare, seems uncertain how to find its modernity. Historically an understated Englishness has been conflated with being British. It is ignoring England that now presents a greater threat to the Union than anything else.’ British Future director Sunder Katwala said: ‘We’ve done nothing in the era of devolution to give a voice to England as well as Scotland and Wales, which has left English identity too open to an extremist fringe. 'The EDL with their street yobbery are not the only ones to blame for the unusual anxiety that too many people in England feel about their own flag of St George. 'They share the blame with the politicians who haven’t spoken up for a modern patriotism, as well as our British identity. ‘While the devolution debates in Scotland and Wales appear to have modernised the Scots and Welsh associations with their flags, attitudes to the English flag are lagging behind.’ Mr Katwala’s appeal is  being backed by MPs including Conservative Robert Halfon, Liberal Democrat Greg Mulholland and Labour’s David Lammy and Jon Cruddas.

"By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 04:59 EST, 23 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:56 EST, 23 March 2012 . On the eve of her release from jail, lying mother Karen Matthews says ‘several others’ were involved in the abduction of her child four years ago, it was claimed today. Matthews, who pretended daughter Shannon, nine, was missing for a month but drugged and hid her under a bed, alleges she would be murdered if she revealed who was behind the plot in Dewsbury Moor, West Yorkshire. Speaking from Foston Hall Prison in Derbyshire, the 36-year-old says she is too frightened to say who actually did it, claiming ‘they should be here, not me’. In a bizarre rant the mother of seven allegedly confided in a friend that all she wants when she gets out is a lie detector test to prove her claims followed by a Big Mac burger from McDonalds. Claims: Convicted kidnapper Karen Matthews, left, abducted daughter Shannon Matthews, right,  in 2008 but now says that 'several others' did it and have threatened her with death if she speaks out . Matthews is due for release before Easter under a new name, after serving half her eight-year jail sentence for kidnap, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice. Her accomplice Michael Donovan, 44, the uncle of her then boyfriend, is believed to have been released this month after serving half of the same sentence. Friend and former neighbour Julie Bushby has visited Matthews throughout her time in jail - despite being conned by Matthews, like many others, into searching for her child at the time - and has revealed her views in the Daily Mirror. Sham: Karen Matthews caused as national frenzy after Shannon disappeared, but in fact had hidden her under a bed with the help of Michael Donovan . ‘I won’t come clean about what I actually know about what happened because I’ve been threatened,’ Matthews told Ms Bushby. ‘When I get out I want a lie detector test to show I’m innocent – and a Big Mac. ‘There are others who should be here instead of me but I was too scared to open my mouth. They said they would kill me if I did. They should be here, not me.’ She added after that she will go to live by the ‘ocean’ under her new identity. Matthews became a hate figure over the plot to abduct Shannon to claim a £50,000 reward. Shown in tears on television, she said Shannon was gone but knew exactly where she was stashed. She has already undergone a ‘full makeover’ complete with a trendy new hairstyle and is hoping she will not be recognised by the public when she is back in the community. As a prisoner released on licence, Matthews is likely to begin her new life at a probation hostel. She and Donovan caused a £3.2million police hunt when they kidnapped Shannon from her home in February 2008. Matthews appeared before the media pretending to be distraught at her daughter’s disappearance and hundreds of local people helped in the search. But Shannon was found by police 24 days later in Donovan’s flat a mile away, hidden in a compartment under a divan. While in jail Matthews has been badly beaten by other inmates and was fired from her cleaner’s job for snooping at confidential files. Lies: Despite a national campaign to find her, Shannon was found by police hidden and drugged in the base of the divan bed . To avoid trouble from prisoners, which include Baby P’s mother and Vanessa George, the nursery paedophile, she spends her time watching daytime TV, doing art and singing to herself in her en suite cell. Ms Bushby, a former residents association chairman, told the Mirror that she still does not believe Sharon is telling the truth but that the original plot was not about the reward money. But since then she has been banned from going to visit by the West Yorkshire Probation service. ‘You have been a great source of comfort to Karen during these difficult years and I know that she has really appreciated it, and considers you her only real friend,’ the letter says. Jailed: Matthews is about to be released from Foston Hall prison, Derbyshire, pictured, after serving half her sentence . ‘However, you, above all people will appreciate the need to ensure we do our level best to keep Karen... safe, upon her release. ‘Karen will be expected to abide by a number of very strict conditions on her release. Not because we are punishing her, but because of the public who consider her a legitimate target for their own anger. ‘Any restrictions placed on Karen have come about after long-term planning and approval from the highest sources within the Home Office.’","The kidnapper allegedly told a friend she'll be murdered if she says who was behind the sick plot to abduct Shannon, 9 .

If you are reliant on your smartphone for directions, then be prepared to brush up with a map and compass if vacation plans include a trip to Darwin, California. The remote town, sitting high in the desert mountains close to the Death Valley National Park, has an excruciatingly slow Internet connection, scant cellphone signal and the dubious honor of becoming one of last places in America not to be hooked up with broadband. A census from 2010, found the town to have just 43 residents across 28 households - and no one under the age of 18. The town sign claimed 50 people lived in Darwin - but no one can verify this as the plaque has been stolen.

John Rothgeb, 67, who has lived in Darwin since the Seventies, told the Los Angeles Times that he accepted sacrifices must be made when you live somewhere as remote - and with such unspoiled natural beauty -  as Darwin. However he then told the Times: 'I understand that you have to give up certain things to live in a beautiful area like this. 'But I didn't move here to get away from everybody.' The town was established by American explorer Dr Darwin French in 1874 after he discovered silver ore deposits in the mountains, just south of Death Valley.

In many other ghost towns across the U.S., when the industry has died, life in the town has also disappeared. However in Darwin, a small community of artists and those preferring life in the wilderness, has remained. The population is made up of mainly couples and no one under the age of 18 lives in the beauty spot. There are no stores to buy anything and nowhere to stay - the nearest supermarket is 90 miles away. The small community has only a local post office where residents can gather to pass the time of day. And even this is in danger of closing next year. Residents have asked their Internet provider Verizon to install broadband in the town but for now, the cost outweighs the demand for the company.

Double family tragedy: Roger Crouch, left, died 18 months after his son Dominic threw himself from a six-storey building . Mr Crouch was overcome with grief at the suicide of his 15-year-old son . Dominic 18 months earlier. The former director of children's services for Gloucestershire County . Council was also struggling to come to terms with the deaths of his . sister from cancer, his nephew, and that of his mother when he was a . child. Following Dominic's death in May 2010 Mr Crouch had taken an overdose of . tablets and was then stopped from making another attempt as he drove . his son's ashes to the Lake District to scatter them. After psychiatric treatment following those two incidents Mr Crouch . begun his award-winning campaign to highlight the problems of homophobic . bullying of children. He launched the campaign following the death of Dominic, who had jumped . from a six-storey building near his school amid rumours he was gay after . he apparently kissed a boy for a dare. He was named as a 'hero of the year' by Stonewall, the lesbian, gay and bisexual charity, for his work. Campaigner: Mr Crouch, pictured with Dominic in happier times . The anti-bullying campaigner took up the cause after it emerged at his . son's inquest that rumours had started before his death in May 2010 that . Dominic might be gay. The gossip followed a school trip to the Forest of Dean where the Year . 10 pupils had been playing spin the bottle and it was said Dominic . kissed a boy. Despite this, Dominic's inquest also heard the 'carefree' rugby-loving . schoolboy had appeared happy after returning from the trip and never . complained about bullying at the school. The hearing heard that Mr Crouch's body was found in the garage of . his home in Gretton, near Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, by his wife Paola . on the night of November 28 last year. Mrs Crouch, 52, alerted neighbours, who had cut down her husband, and . they attempted to resuscitate him but paramedics declared him dead at . 8.45pm.

On hearing evidence from psychiatrists that her husband had been . 'overcome by grief', Mrs Crouch added: 'I think it's what you might call . in an old fashioned way, a broken heart.' A post mortem examination found that Mr Crouch, who was the town clerk . for Stow-on-the-Wold, had enough alcohol in his body to be nearly twice . the drink drive limit. Tests did not find any trace of drugs. The cause of death was given as aspiration of gastric contents due to hanging. Grief: Dominic's mother Paola with her son.

"Daniel Wacht faces up to life in prison without parole . Investigators found the severed head of 54-year-old Kurt Johnson in Wacht's basement in 2010 . By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 21:41 EST, 24 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 21:41 EST, 24 April 2012 . A North Dakota man was convicted today of shooting and beheading a university researcher in what prosecutors claimed was an attempt to start a white supremacist group. Jurors had the case for less than three hours Tuesday before finding Daniel Wacht, 31, of the eastern North Dakota town of Cooperstown, guilty in the death of 54-year-old Kurt Johnson. Wacht shook his head from side to side as the verdict was read. He faces up to life in prison without parole. Johnson was last seen alive getting into Wacht's van outside a Cooperstown bar on New Year's Eve 2010. His severed head was found in a crawl space in Wacht's basement about a week later. His body has never been found. Guilty: Jurors had the case of Daniel Wacht, 31, less than three hours before delivering their verdict . Though Johnson was white, prosecutors contended Wacht was motivated by his attraction to the Aryan Nation. They said he wanted to start a local white supremacist group and make a statement by blowing something up or killing someone. The defense contended prosecutors didn't have enough evidence to prove Wacht killed Johnson and questioned the alleged motive. Johnson was a North Dakota State University researcher based in Cooperstown, which has fewer than 1,000 residents and is about 75 miles northwest of Fargo. The verdict came on what would have been his 56th birthday - something his brother, Kory Johnson, said was both fitting and painful. Asked if he would implore Wacht to disclose the location of his brother's body, Johnson paused for several seconds. 'To Mr. Wacht, the jury spoke volumes. Justice has been done here,' he said. 'As far as my brother's body, I know his soul is in heaven.' Defense attorney Steven Mottinger said he would consider some pretrial issues for appeal but would not be specific. Victim: Kurt Johnson, 54, was last seen getting into Wacht's van alive before his severed head was found in a crawl space in the killer's basement in 2010 . 'It was a tough case,' Mottinger said. 'We did what we could with the evidence we had to work with.' Marina Spahr, the Griggs County attorney and lead prosecutor, left the courtroom without commenting. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Byers, who helped with the case, said he was pleased with the verdict. 'You would like to hope that it provides a little bit of closure for the family. But it doesn't bring him back,' Byers said. Jurors were given the case around noon, and returned the verdict before 3pm. Mottinger contended in his closing argument Tuesday morning that there were no eyewitnesses and no way to prove his client pulled the trigger. Mottinger also asked the jury why Wacht would 'kill a white man' for recognition from a white supremacist outfit. 'Hint, guess and suspicion are not and can never be enough,' Mottinger told jurors during closing arguments. However, Spahr told jurors there were 'layers of evidence' to prove Wacht was guilty. During his closing, Spahr highlighted evidence that included a love seat cushion found in Wacht's garbage that was soaked with Johnson's blood and boots and gloves with Johnson's blood on the outside and Wacht's DNA inside. 'You don't have to see Daniel Wacht pull the trigger to know that he did,' Spahr said. James Bolstad, who is now in prison on a probation violation, was a key witness in the case. He testified for prosecutors that Wacht had told him he wanted to do something dramatic to start a local Aryan Nation group. Mottinger questioned Bolstad's credibility. 'They base their whole theory on a man who admits to multiple felonies, admits his testimony would help him out of his own legal problems,' the defense attorney told jurors. Bolstad is in prison on a probation violation stemming from his conviction in a theft and drug paraphernalia case in 2004.","Daniel Wacht faces up to life in prison without parole .

And it seems increasing numbers of families are looking for help from the gods, even when it comes to naming their newborns. Nevaeh - or heaven spelt backwards - has become one of the fastest-growing popular names for babies. Another unusual name, Miley, is also pushing up the rankings, thanks to the fame of American actress and pop singer Miley Cyrus. On the rise: The name Miley is growing in popularity, thanks to the fame of actress Miley Cyrus . But some celebrity names - . such as Jordan, inspired by reality TV star Katie Price and U.S. basketball great Michael Jordan - are on the wane. Britons can find out how popular their name is by visiting a website which analyses figures from the Office for National Statistics. The website, England & Wales Baby Names, found that names have become more diverse, with the total number soaring from about 8,700 in 1996 to more than 13,400 in 2010. The names which have increased in popularity the most since 1996 are: . BOYS: . 1. Oliver2. Ethan3. Charlie4. Lucas5. Noah6. Archie7. Oscar8. Riley9. Jayden10. Logan . GIRLS: . 1.  Lily2.  Grace3.  Ava4.  Evie5.  Amelia6.  Ellie7.  Isabella8.  Olivia9.  Mia10. Maisie . The most popular names are Lily for girls and Oliver for boys, but the study of some 27,000 names found Nevaeh had risen to number 163 in the list. There were no Nevaehs in 2000. More than 320 children had the name in 2010. Trend-setter: The name Nevaeh - heaven spelt backwards - became popular after Christian rocker Sonny Sandoval chose it for his daughter . The trend can be linked to Sonny Sandoval, an American singer with Christian rock band POD, who gave the name Nevaeh to one of his daughters. He mentioned it during an interview on MTV and the name became a hot topic on internet chat rooms. In 2001, it was among the 1,000 most popular names for babies in the U.S. Other unusual names which have grown in popularity, as well as Miley, include Macy, Olly and Kenzie. As they have become more common, Jordan has been on a downward trend for boys and girls since 1996. Researchers also found that hyphenated first names had trebled in popularity. The website's creator, Anna Powell-Smith, 31, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said: “Broadly, in recent years, girls’ names have become more flowery and old-fashioned, while Biblical boys’ names are out of favour. “Parents consistently show more variety when naming their daughters than their sons.” The website only includes names that were given to three or more babies. A survey published this week found that more than two in five Britons confessed to having second thoughts after naming their child. Going down: The name Jordan, inspired by reality TV star Katie Price and U.S. basketball great Michael Jordan, is losing popularity . Of those who admitted regret, 19 per cent admitted to 'not liking’ their child’s name and a further two per cent owned up to aggressively disliking it. Twenty-two per cent told the survey that their child’s name ‘grew’ on them. The high figures are believed to be linked to celebrity names which go out of fashion when stars fade from the spotlight.

That, prosecutors contend, is what sent Jennifer Hudson's then brother-in-law into such a jealous rage that he shot dead her mother, brother and seven-year-old nephew in a horrific act of vindictiveness in the home where the Hollywood star grew up. A prosecutor is expected to tell jurors that during opening statements at the trial of William Balfour - charged with three counts of first-degree murder over the October 24, 2008 slayings that generated nationwide headlines because of Hudson's fame. Tragic: Jennifer Hudson holding her Oscar with her mother other Darnell Hudson Donerson, 57, who was found dead at the family's home in Chicago in 2008 . The estranged husband of Hudson's . sister, Balfour believed the balloons he saw at the Hudson home came . from Julia Hudson's new boyfriend; driving away for her job as a school . bus driver, she glimpsed Balfour in her mirror still lingering outside, . prosecutors have said. They say Balfour went back inside the three-story house around 9am and used a .45-caliber handgun to kill Hudson's mother, 57-year-old Darnell Hudson Donerson, in the living room - then shot her 29-year-old brother, Jason Hudson, twice in the head as he lay in bed. Trial: William Balfour is on trial accused of murdering Jennifer Hudson's mother Darnell Donerson, older brother Jason and nephew Julian King . He allegedly drove off in Jason Hudson's SUV with Julia Hudson's son, Julian King, inside. Authorities say he shot the boy nicknamed Juice Box in the head as he lay behind a front seat. His body was found in the abandoned vehicle miles away after a three-day search. There are no known witnesses to the slayings, and it's unclear what physical evidence exists, be it fingerprints or DNA. Prosecutors say gunshot residue was found on the steering wheel of Balfour's car. But the defense says that and other evidence is circumstantial. Close ties: Jennifer Hudson offered $100,000 for the safe return of her nephew Julian King, seven (left) A gun, which Balfour allegedly stole months before from Hudson's brother, was recovered in a lot near where the SUV was found and will be presented as the murder weapon. Establishing motive may pose less of a challenge. A high-school dropout and one-time Gangster Disciple known by the gang name 'Flex', Balfour allegedly threatened to kill the Hudson family at least two dozen times, starting earlier in 2008 when he moved out of the house, lead prosecutor James McKay has said. Murder trial: William Balfour is the estranged husband of Jennifer Hudson's sister Julia. He is accused of killing her mother, brother and nephew four years ago . A day before the killings, on Julia Hudson's birthday, McKay says, Balfour told her, 'If you ever leave me, I'm going to kill you, but I'm going to kill your family first.' She didn't take him seriously, McKay said, because Balfour hadn't acted on the threats before. Court records indicate the now 34-year-old Julia Hudson's divorce from Balfour was finalized last year. If convicted of at least two of the murder counts, the 30-year-old Balfour, on parole at the time of the killings after serving nearly seven years for attempted murder and vehicular hijacking, would face a mandatory life sentence. Harrowing: Jennifer Hudson poses with her Oscar in 2008 and brother-in-law William Balfour. She could testify at his murder trial over the shootings of her mother, brother and nephew . Jennifer Hudson's name is among 300 on a list of potential witnesses, though it's not certain she will testify. The 2004 American Idol finalist and 2007 Oscar winner for her role in Dreamgirls is expected to attend each day of testimony, which could last up to a month. Judge Charles Burns has instructed jurors to set aside any sympathy for Hudson and decide a verdict strictly according to testimony. The panelists include a teacher, a trucker and two people who have had close relatives murdered. Proceedings: William Balfour's murder trial started this week at the Cook County courthouse in Chicago . Prosecutors have said Balfour claimed he wasn't near the Hudson home at the time of the killing, but they are expected to introduce cellphone records that allegedly prove he was in the area when two teenage girls who live nearby heard gunshots. The witnesses didn't immediately report the shots to police because the sound of gunfire isn't uncommon in the impoverished, crime-ridden Englewood neighbourhood, according to court filings. Troubled relationship: Jennifer Hudson's sister Julia with her estranged husband William Balfour who is standing trial for murdering her relatives . At a time when cities across the country have seen the number of homicides fall, sometimes dramatically, Chicago's jumped by a whopping 60 per cent the first three months of the year, and Englewood's violence was a big reason why. Since he took office last May, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has used the word 'Englewood' as almost shorthand for gangs, guns and the dangers facing the city's children. The deteriorating neighborhood has presented him with one of his biggest challenges, becoming a focus for his promise to deploy more police officers to the street while cracking down on Englewood's gangs. Violence: The boarded up former home of Jennifer Hudson and her family in Englewood, Chicago. There are thousands of boarded-up buildings in the city's most notorious neighbourhood . There are a host of reasons for Englewood's downward spiral. But they mostly boil down to an exodus of families from an area that was predominantly single-family homes, resulting in an explosion in the number of abandoned buildings, and an influx of gang members.Home to 100,000 residents in 1960, Englewood's population has dwindled. It had dropped to about 40,000 in 2000 and to 30,000 just 10 years later.Part of the reason is that families moved out to safer places and others lost their homes when they lost jobs during the recession.According to the police department, there are more than 4,100 abandoned buildings in Englewood, nearly 600 of them vacated in just the last 15 months.

While he faces another 28 years behind bars in Peru, the prime suspect in the disappearance of Natalee Holloway may be freed just long enough to face trial in the U.S. Joran van der Sloot is one step closer to being carted to the United States in an extradition that could bring him face-to-face with Ms Holloway's mother, seven years after 18-year-old Natalee vanished in Aruba. But legal hurdles - including van der Sloot’s appeal for his Peru murder conviction - will keep the process from going through immediately. Jailed: Dutch citizen Joran Van der Sloot may face extradition to the U.S. for allegedly trying to extort money from Natalee Holloway's mother Beth . Convicted: Van der Sloot was sentenced to 28 years in prison in the murder of Stephany Flores . Van der Sloot’s lawyer Maximo Altez told CNN: 'I think he will be extradited within the next three months'. Mr Altez added that if van der Sloot is convicted in America, he will be returned to Peru to serve out the remainder of his sentence there, and then shipped back to the U.S. to serve whatever sentence he may receive in the extortion case. In the U.S., he is accused of trying to extort $250,000 from Beth Holloway to tell her where to find the remains of her daughter, who was 18 when she disappeared in Aruba. Prosecutors said $25,000 was paid to van der Sloot, but nothing was disclosed about the Ms Holloway's whereabouts. Tale of two women: Stephany Flores, left, was murdered five years after Natalee Holloway, right, went missing in . Aruba. Van der Sloot was arrested twice in the Holloway case, but never . charged . Authorities said they believe the Dutchman used the money to travel to Peru on May 14, 2010, where he was convicted of killing Stephany Flores, a woman he met in a Lima casino, on May 25. The date is a chilling one to the family of Natalee Holloway, as it was five years to the day after the 18-year-old was last seen. He took cash and credit cards from Ms Flores before fleeing to Chile, where he was caught two days after her decaying body was found. Taken away: Van der Sloot, centre, is seen escorted by police officers in Lima in this photo from June 2010, after his arrest for the murder of Stephany Flores . He confessed to the 'cruel' murder, telling police he became enraged after she found out about his suspected involvement in the Natalee Holloway case. Under Peru's penal system, van der Sloot could become eligible for parole after serving half of the sentence with good behaviour, including work and study. Altez . said his client fears extradition because U.S. prisons have a reputation . for being 'very hard' on inmates. Natalee Holloway disappeared on May 30, 2005, during a high school graduation trip to Aruba, where Van der Sloot grew up. Parents: David Holloway, left, is seen . during a hearing in Alabama, while Beth . Holloway, right, is pursued by reporters after a hearing after which . her daughter was officially declared dead . Her body was never found and repeated searches turned up nothing as intense media coverage brought the case worldwide attention.

That investigation remains open, though there has been no recent activity, according to Solicitor General Taco Stein, an official with the prosecutor's office in Aruba.

The flour bombing incident to which the fake Smith was referring was at the London West Hollywood Hotel last week. Kardashian was plastered with flour while promoting her new fragrance, True Reflection. Though the woman was apparently pulling a dusty prank, she was arrested at the scene; Kardashian said she will be pressing charges.

FOUR firemen died after bosses  ordered them into a blazing warehouse containing just cardboard boxes and old furniture, a court heard yesterday. With an inferno raging at the vegetable packing factory, they were allegedly sent into a smoke-filled storage room even though there was no one inside. All employees at the factory in Atherstone-on-Stour, Warwickshire, had been accounted for when the men were told to go in, the court heard. Fire chiefs Paul Simmons, left, and Timothy Woodward, right, are on trial over the deaths of four firefighters . As three fire service managers faced trial yesterday, prosecutors described the deaths as ‘needless’. The bodies of Ashley Stephens, 20, John Averis, 27, and Darren Yates-Badley, 24, were found in the gutted building. Ian Reid, 44, died in hospital. The tragedy in 2007 is believed to have been the single worst loss of life for the fire service in 35 years. Adrian Ashley is the third member of the fire service to face trial over the four deaths . Prosecutor Richard Matthews QC told Stafford Crown Court the firemen, who were all part-timers, had lost their lives ‘as a result of having been sent into a situation where no one was in peril and no one required rescue’. Mr Matthews told the jury: ‘The four men lost their lives not in a valiant effort to rescue anyone, but having been ordered into a smoke-filled large storage compartment containing mostly cardboard boxes. This is not a case about what some see as the irritating trivialities of health and safety red tape. ‘This is not about stopping the heroic members of our emergency services from risking their lives, and the lives of those who may be under their command, to save others. ‘Rather, it’s only about the needless loss of four lives, four individuals, lost as a result of having been sent into a situation where no one was in peril... sent into what was and should have been recognised as an obviously dangerous situation for no good reason.’ More than 80 firemen and 16 fire engines tackled the blaze for more than five hours on November 2. The court heard how Mr Reid became separated from his colleagues before being found by a rescue team in a storage area in a ‘disorientated and panicked state’. He was ‘seen to rush from his would-be rescuers, attempting to find his way out from the very smoky storage area’. When he was found again he wasn’t breathing. As conditions worsened, rescuers retreated without finding the three remaining members of the team. Mr Matthews said the blaze was not properly assessed by commanders and the defendants had ‘badly failed to fulfil their duties to the firefighters under their command’.

Former neighbourhood watch captain George Zimmerman's attorney says a website created to raise money for his legal defense has raised more than $200,000 in donations. Mark O'Mara said on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 Thursday night that he learned about the money on Wednesday and will inform a judge at a Friday hearing. Zimmerman, who has been charged with second-degree murder in the February 26 shooting of Trayvon Martin, was released from jail this week after paying 10 percent of $150,000 bail. Scroll down for video . Sprung: George Zimmerman is now in hiding after his release from jail in Seminole County, Florida, after he posted bail . Lawyer: Zimmerman's attorney Mark O'Mara told CNN on Thursday night that his client has informed him that a website he set up collected more than $200,000 for his legal defence fund . O'Mara says the bail amount may have been higher if the judge knew Zimmerman had raised $200,000. The website used to raise the money has since been shut down, but O'Mara said he'll likely start a new defense fund for Zimmerman. O'Mara did not immediately return a Thursday evening phone message by The Associated Press. Zimmerman was released from jail shortly after midnight on Sunday. His current whereabouts are being kept secret for his safety and he is very likely outside of Florida. Defence: George Zimmerman has set up this website to raise funds for his legal costs and living expenses. It was later shut down, but not before it collected more than $200,000 . Out: It's not known where Zimmerman will stay . until his trial in the murder of Trayvon Martin . Judge . Lester said at a hearing Friday he cannot have any guns and must . observe a 7pm-to-6am curfew. Zimmerman also surrendered his passport. Zimmerman had to put up 10 per cent, or $15,000, to make bail. His father had indicated he might take out a second mortgage. He worked at a mortgage risk-management company at the time of the shooting and his wife Shellie is in nursing school. Bail is not unheard of in second-degree . murder cases, and legal experts had predicted it would be granted for . Zimmerman because of his ties to the community, because he turned . himself in after he was charged last week, and because he has never been . convicted of a serious crime. Confrontation: Zimmerman, pictured left in his mugshot, was charged with the second-degree murder in the death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin (right) in Sanford, Florida, in February . Walking out: Zimmerman's ultimate destination is being kept secret for his safety and it is very likely outside of Florida . Speaking at his bail hearing last week, Zimmerman, 28, apologised to Trayvon's parents, coming face-to-face . with the victim's family for the first time. He said: 'I am sorry for . the loss of your son… I did not know if he was armed or not.' Addressing Trayvon Martin's family directly Zimmerman said: 'I did not know how old he was. I thought he was a little bit older than I was'. The 28-year-old is charged with second degree murder for the February 26 killing of the 17-year-old Martin. Zimmerman told cops that he spotted Martin while on patrol in his neighbourhood, which had been plagued by burglaries in vandalism in recent months, and called 911 to report a suspicious . person. Court: Zimmerman attended his first court hearing on April 12 after he was officially charged over Trayvon's death . Victim: Zimmerman insists that he was acting in self-defence after Trayvon attacked him . 'This guy looks like he is up to no good. He is on drugs or something,' Zimmerman told the dispatcher from his sport utility vehicle. He added that the teen had his hand in his waistband and was walking around looking at homes. 'These a*******. They always get away,' Zimmerman was heard saying on the 911 call. But Trayvon was not armed. He was returning from a convenience store with an iced tea for himself and a bag of skittles for his little brother. A neighbour said there had been . several break-ins in the community in the past year, including one in . which burglars took a TV and laptops. A . dispatcher told Zimmerman to stay in his sport utility vehicle and that . an officer would be there momentarily, but Zimmerman - for unknown . reasons - got out. March: Thousands have protested over Trayvon's killing, which many see as racially motivated . Zimmerman told police he lost sight of the teenager and was walking back to his vehicle when he was suddenly attacked. He claims he shot the teen in self-defence.

A priest, charged with the attempted rape of a 14-year-old boy, has said that although he let the teenager share his bed and view pornography, he had never touched him. The accuser, who is now 30, testified today that he was 14 when Reverend James Brennan, 48, sexually abused him at his apartment. Reverend James Brennan, 48, was one of several priests involved in the clergy abuse trial which has scandalised the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. Allegations: Reverend James Brennan, 48, has been accused of abusing a 14-year-old boy in 1996 at his home in Westchester, Philadelphia . The alleged victim, who has not been identified, said he was abused at Brennan's home in Westchester in 1996 while the priest was on voluntary leave. Brennan met the accuser in 1990 . when he worked at a parish in Newtown, Bucks County. He worked at . Cardinal O'Hara High School from 1991 until 1996. Brennan has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges, which include attempted rape. He has remained a priest throughout the abuse scandal. Brennan's lawyer raised questions today about his client's accuser. During a 2008 church trial on the sex . assault charges, the accuser dropped an allegation that Brennan had . abused him years later when he was doing court-ordered community . service, according to testimony. Monsignor Kevin Quirk, a canon lawyer . who presided at the church trial, read Brennan's 2008 testimony aloud. Brennan had admitted showing the boy pornography and sharing a bed but denied any . sexual contact. Shamed: Monsignor Lynn, seen outside the Criminal Justice Centre in Philadelphia last month, has been charged with child endangerment . On cross-examination, a defense . lawyer asked why Quirk never questioned Brennan about another accusation . of an assault in a garden shed. Quirk said: 'The accuser ... had withdrawn that portion of the accusation.' Another 47-year-old alleged victim broke down today when he recalled telling his mother in 1998 about being abused by defrocked priest David Sicoli in the late 1970s. Sicoli molested him at his home in Sea Isle, New Jersey, in the priest's sports car and on other occasions, the man testified. The unidentified man told the court: 'It always felt wrong. A man should not touch a child.' Like other accusers who have testified, the boy worked at the rectory, and his mother had hopes of him becoming a priest. A 2005 grand jury report alleged that Sicoli abused at least a dozen boys and said the archdiocese had suspicions about the priest before he was sent to Levittown, Pennsylvania. Landmark case: This courtroom sketch shows the Rev. James J. Brennan, second left, and Monsignor William Lynn, third left at as Assistant District Attorney Jacqueline Coelho, standing right, speaks to the jury earlier this month . Monsignor William Lynn, 61, has been charged with endangering children by keeping accused priests in their roles - after reviewing abuse complaints kept in secret archives when he served as secretary for the clergy from 1992 to 2004. Lynn was the first Roman Catholic church official to be charged in the U.S. for his handling of priest abuse complaints. His lawyers have argued that Lynn took orders from the cardinal. The late Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua noted in a file that Brennan sought leave in 1996 to deal with his own childhood sexual abuse. Brennan later denied having said that.","Reverend James Brennan, 48, charged with attempted rape at clerical abuse trial in Philadelphia .

James Hazell made his comments while hosting a debate about whether women should nurse their babies in public when a guest described it as ‘the most natural thing in the world’. He said: ‘Next time you are out having a meal at a restaurant, on the basis that it [breastfeeding] is the most natural thing in the world, I will come in there with my wife and then make love right in front of you. ‘Breastfeeding is the most natural thing in the world, and that is fine, but there are a lot of natural things we don’t do in public.’ Laura Cardwell, a mother of two from  Ipswich, was interviewed for the BBC Radio Suffolk show which aired this week. She said: ‘I listened to the programme later, only to find what should have been a positive affirmation for breastfeeding mothers was turned into crass and ignorant nonsense. related] . ‘I was appalled.

MPs are fighting to keep 12 fig trees in their offices, even though it costs the taxpayer £32,500 a year. They say removing the trees from an entrance hall in a parliamentary office block would make the place too hot and noisy. More than £400,000 has been spent on the rental and upkeep of the trees since they were installed 11 years ago. Not giving a fig: Politicians say this entrance at Portcullis House in Westminister would become overheated if the trees were removed . Despite this, MPs are suggesting they be kept – claiming that uprooting the trees would make the glass-roofed atrium of Portcullis House, in Westminster, uncomfortably hot in the summer and would decrease the quality of air that MPs breathe. They also claim that removing the trees would result in ‘higher ambient noise levels’, making it harder for parliamentarians to do their job. In February, John Bercow said he was 'horrified' to discover that parliamentary authorities had signed the contract and called for it to be scrapped . The option of keeping the trees will be discussed at a meeting of Commons officials next week. In February, Speaker John Bercow said he was ‘horrified’ to discover that parliamentary authorities had signed the contract, which began in 2001, and called for it to be scrapped to save taxpayers’ money. But it has now emerged that the House of Commons Commission, which runs the parliamentary estate, is suggesting that getting rid of the trees could be more trouble than it is worth. Instead, they will try to reduce the cost to taxpayers by renegotiating with the rental firm Plant Care. The information was revealed by Anne . Main, Tory MP for St Albans, after she tabled a parliamentary question . to the House of Commons Commission. She . asked whether the body had ‘given consideration to the use of the space . previously occupied by the fig trees in Portcullis House in the event . that the trees are removed’. John . Thurso, a Lib Dem MP who sits on the board of the Commission, replied: . ‘No. The Commission agreed on February 27 that the contract for the hire . and upkeep of trees should be renegotiated at the earliest opportunity . with the aim of reducing the cost significantly. ‘Removal of the trees would lead to a . noticeable increase in noise levels and reduced levels of shade . (especially in summer, where the glass roof would probably lead to a . requirement for additional cooling). The trees also improve air . quality.’ The option of keeping the trees inside Portcullis House, pictured, will be discussed at a meeting of Commons officials next week . Mr Thurso added: ‘The removal of the trees would result in higher ambient noise levels.’ A spokesman for the House of Commons Commission said no decision would be taken on what to do with the trees until next week. A spokesman for the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘Despite all the warm words from Westminster, it appears MPs are all talk when it comes to rooting out wasteful spending. ‘Taxpayers are getting a terrible deal from renting this opulent greenery. Parliament should do the right thing and find a more affordable solution. ‘Politicians shouldn’t shy away from ditching wasteful contracts.’ Not giving a fig: Politicians say this entrance would become overheated .","More than £400,000 has been spent on the rental and upkeep of the trees since 2001 .

Mitt Romney's biggest supporter Donald Trump has now turned his attentions to his wife - by creating a one-off birthday cake of her riding a horse. The billionaire real estate tycoon and his wife Melania did the busy Republican presidential candidate's job for him this year by throwing Ann Romney a huge bash at the Trump Tower in New York yesterday. And the centrepiece of her 63rd birthday party was a large cake handmade by celebrity chef Buddy Valastro, topped with a sweet-tasting Romney atop a sugary horse in a field of green icing, according to ABC News. Tasty: The cake with a lifelike Ann Romney on a horse was the centrepiece of a birthday party for her and a $600,000 fundraiser for husband Mitt, thrown by the Trumps . Horse-riding Ann love equestrianism because it helps lessen the impact of her multiple sclerosis. But it was not all about her, as the glamorous bash attended by at least 400 people was expected to raise around $600,000 for her husband's campaign. 'This birthday party and fundraiser will be the highest-grossing and fastest-selling event to date for the Romney campaign,' executive vice president of the Trump Organization, Michael Cohen said. Spot the difference: Ann Romney on a horse - she enjoys the sport and it eases her MS symptoms . 'Melania looks forward to spending more time with Ann and hosting this special occasion in two weeks,' he added. In February Mr Trump threw his considerable influence behind the Romney campaign after months of speculation. 'Mitt is tough, he's smart, he's sharp,' Mr Trump said. 'He's not going to allow bad things to continue to happen in this country we all love. So, Governor Romney, go out and get 'em. You can do it.' Backer: Donald Trump, right, is a big supporter of Mitt Romney, centre, and is shown here in February when he officially threw his support behind him . Since then he has done dozens of interviews and appearances in many states backing him. Accepting his backing Mitt Romney said: 'I've had some success in the private sector. Not quite as successful as this guy, but successful nonetheless. 'There are some things you just can't imagine happening in your life. This is one of them.' And this latest event is the icing on the cake for the Romneys.","The wife of Mitt Romney was thrown a huge 63rd birthday bash at Trump Tower, New York .

A devastated husband has hit out after he was charged £2,300 to cancel his wife's holiday of a lifetime - after she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer. Mum-of-two Caroline Newman, 49, was given the bombshell that she had stage-two breast cancer and needed immediate radiotherapy after taking part in an under-50s screening trial. Ten days earlier, husband Colin, 47, had booked them on a luxury £7,670 holiday in Las Vegas as part of her 50th birthday celebration. The terrible news meant Colin was forced to call off the trip so Caroline could have surgery and start radiotherapy. But Virgin Holidays - despite hearing of Caroline's severe illness - charged the couple, of Sherburn-in-Elmet, North Yorkshire, a 30 per cent cancellation fee of around £2,300. Colin had only booked the holiday ten days before he found out his wife had cancer, after saving up for months in secret. Colin, a fire consultant, said: 'I . couldn't believe it when Virgin Holidays said they couldn't do anything . but charge me 30 per cent. What gets me is their lack of compassion. 'We . have flown with Virgin quite a lot and use them in preference to . everyone else. We got married in 1998 and went to Florida with Virgin . for our honeymoon, then a couple of years back we took the whole family . to Florida again. 'We have been loyal customers for a long time. I asked them to refund the full amount with a view to us rebooking the trip when - hopefully - Caroline has recovered. 'Virgin Holidays said because they really cared they would assist the family in claiming the amount back on our holiday insurance, but they wouldn't be refunding us.' Luxury:  Encore At Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas where Colin had booked a king suite for his wife's birthday . Sunshine trip: Colin saved up for months to be able to treat his wife to the luxury break . Splendour: The couple were destined to have the trip of a lifetime at the Vegas hotel . 'It was her 50th birthday so I had phoned up her work and arranged time off without her knowing.

Cancelled: Virgin Holidays charged a fee of £2,300 to cancel the luxury break . 'But then when I had to break the news, it was a case of 'This is what you could have had, but you have cancer, so we're not going'. It was like that moment on Bullseye when they say 'here's what you could have won'. Colin originally booked upper class . seats on a Virgin Atlantic flight from Manchester to Las Vegas on April . 12 - the day before his wife's 50th birthday. He . had planned to keep it a secret until closer to the time and then . reveal more surprises - such as a Limousine from the airport to the .

Freedom: Phillip Machemedze walked free from court today after a judge ruled his sickening past was in 'another land' A violent former henchman of Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe has escaped jail despite fraudulently earning thousands of pounds working illegally in Britain as a carer. Phillip Machemedze walked free from court today after a judge ruled his sickening past was in 'another land'. The former enforcer, 47, lied about his immigration status to work in the drug and alcohol recovery unit at The Priory for five years without a visa. He was also employed for seven years as a support worker for the Milestones Trust, a charity helping people with learning disabilities. He fraudulently earned £151,000 while working illegally in Britain. Former African enforcer Machemedze only successfully applied for asylum to the UK two years ago - allowing him and his wife to permanently stay in the country. An immigration hearing heard how he broke one victim's jaw with a pair of pliers and shocked another with electric cables while working as one of Mugabe's henchmen. But Machemedze - who claims benefits funded by the UK taxpayer - walked free from court today after admitting two charges of obtaining pecuniary advantage by deception. Judge Julian Lambert, sitting at Bristol Crown Court, gave Machemedze his liberty after receiving a notebook logging work he completed to 'benefit' his local community in the city. The former enforcer, 47, lied about his immigration status to work in the drug and alcohol recovery unit at The Priory, Bristol, pictured, for five years without a visa . The judge said: 'You are 47 years old and you have no previous convictions recorded against you in this country. 'Your past is in another land and that which took place in your past took place beyond our jurisdiction. Shocking: An immigration hearing heard how he broke one victim's jaw with a pair of pliers and shocked another with electric cables while working as one of Robert Mugabe's, pictured, henchmen (file pic) 'When prohibited from working by your immigration status you got two jobs. 'The case is notable because you worked rather than sought state benefits. 'You worked hard and there are no complaints about the quality of your work. 'You are a Zimbabwean national and it has been determined by others that you may stay in this country and not return there. 'But your lies here should not have been told.' Judge Lambert sentenced Machemedze to nine months imprisonment, suspended for two years. He ordered him to be electronically tagged and observe a curfew between 9pm and 6am for six months. Machemedze, who has just acquired a new job working for 42 hours a week, will pay a fine of £1,000 in £10 weekly instalments. Last October the judge told Machemedze he would walk free from court if he volunteered at his local Pentecostal church for just half a day a week for six months. Machemedze, who lives in Redfield, Bristol, with wife Febbie, was a bodyguard to a senior minister as part of Mugabe's feared Central Intelligence Organisation. Richard Posner, prosecuting the case, previously told the court how Machemedze had arrived at London Gatwick from Zimbabwe in July 2000 and was given a six-month visa but prohibited from working. But he stayed in Britain - working illegally as a carer at an adolescent unit with The Priory in Bristol from June 2005 to May 2010. Hearing: Bristol Crown Court heard Machemedze had illegally secured jobs by getting through several checks, including an enhanced criminal record bureau check . He also worked as a support worker for the Milestones Trust from May 2003 to May 2010. Bristol Crown Court heard Machemedze had illegally secured jobs by getting through several checks, including an enhanced criminal record bureau check. To obtain employment the Zimbabwean had also been able to provide the Home Office letter, a National insurance number as well as birth and marriage certificates. In April 2005, the Milestones Trust were tipped off that Machemedze was working illegally - but he provided a letter from the Home Office stating otherwise. During the seven-years of work, Machemedze took home a net income of around £151,000 before eventually applying for asylum. An immigration judge decided Machemedze could face torture if he was returned home in May 2010. He ruled that the African and his wife - who was also granted asylum - could stay in Britain indefinitely and earn a living. Jane Chamberlain, mitigating, confirmed her client could pay £10 each week towards his £1,000 fine, starting from May 1. She said: 'Up until this point he has been receiving benefits.' Machemedze, dressed in a black open necked shirt and black trousers, did not comment as he left the court.","Phillip Machemedze walked free from court today after a judge ruled his sickening past was in 'another land'

Guilty: Michael Saunders, 48, was handed a 12-year prison sentence for brutally stabbing his partner in front of their four-year-old girl . A four-year-old girl was the key witness in a trial that saw her father jailed for an 'atrocious' knife attack on her mother. Michael Saunders, 48, from Swindon, Wiltshire, was handed a 12-year prison sentence at Bristol Crown Court after pleading guilty to attempted murder. Saunders attacked his partner, slashing her across the face in front of their four-year-old daughter, while their two-year-old was asleep in his cot. The woman, who has not been named, suffered a number of knife wounds to her face and arms and was rushed to hospital after the girl pleaded with her father to call an ambulance. The four-year-old was able to give a clear account to the police, telling them: 'Daddy had the knife. It was a big knife. He tipped the knife upside down and went like this (demonstrating a downward stabbing motion). 'Mummy got hit on the head.' The girl told police that she saw her mother bleeding heavily and added: 'Daddy told mummy to die and he told the police that mummy had a knife but she didn't. That was a lie.' The Crown Prosecution Service said the attack was a 'tragic' case of domestic violence. The couple had been living together on and off for approximately six years after they met on a night out in Nottingham, the court heard. Last year they moved their family to Swindon and while Saunders continued working in Nottingham, their relationship started to fall apart and he became abusive. Rachael Marshall, senior Crown Prosecutor for Wessex, said: 'This is a tragic case of extreme domestic violence where the controlling and aggressive behaviour of the defendant led him to stab his partner in front of their daughter who was four-years-old at the time, while their two-year-old boy was sleeping in his cot. 'From the moment they moved to the Swindon area, their relationship deteriorated. 'On Friday 16 December 2011 the victim decided to go on a night out with her brother, leaving the children with Saunders. 'Not long after she returned home and went to bed, Saunders confronted her. He knew that she wanted to leave him and could not bear it. 'She went to the bathroom where he followed her with a large kitchen knife and launched a violent attack. 'The couple's child was woken up by the noise from the fight and witnessed the atrocious scene. No child should ever witness such a distressing scene. It was the child that urged Saunders to call for an ambulance.' Ms Marshall said the girl's evidence along with other available evidence made a strong case against Saunders, of Freshbrook, Swindon, and it was clear that he did not act in self-defence. 'Thanks to his guilty plea, the victim and her daughter will not have to re-live their ordeal,' she added. 'We hope now that they will be able to move on with their lives. Our thoughts are with them at this moment.'",Father jailed for 12 years for slashing partner across face .

Three siblings who sparked a nationwide manhunt after allegedly pulling off a daring bank robbery were today sentenced to decades in prison. Stripper Lee Grace Dougherty and her two brothers were convicted of firing shots at police officers as they were arrested in Colorado, and now face extradition to Georgia to stand trial over the heist which marked the start of their multistate crime spree. Lee Grace admitted she had shown 'poor judgment' in leading her younger siblings on the nine-day rampage. Jailed: Lee Grace Dougherty was sentence to 24 years in prison for leading her brothers on a crime spree . Plea: Dylan Stanley-Dougherty weeps as he argues for a lighter sentence over his role in a shoot-out with police . Ryan Dougherty was given 18 years in prison, Lee Grace received 24 years, and Dylan Stanley-Dougherty got 32 years. Prosecutors say Dylan, 27, was the one who fired at officers pursuing the siblings before their capture on August 10. The hearings effectively end the siblings' six-month stay in Colorado jails as Georgia authorities await their extradition. The three were the focus of a cross-country search last year after authorities said they fired at a police officer in Florida and robbed a Georgia bank. The search ended with a police chase in Colorado, where shots were fired at officers before the siblings' car rolled and crashed into a guard rail. Lee Grace, 29, had faced up to 28 years in prison after pleading guilty to first-degree assault and two counts of menacing in the Colorado case. In court on Monday, the judge told her that as the oldest of the three siblings, she should have shown better judgment. 'I'd like to say it was a lapse in judgment, but 10 days is not a lapse in judgment,' Lee Grace replied. 'It was bad, poor judgment.' Guilty: Ryan, Dylan and Lee Grace led authorities on a nine-day manhunt in August last year . Subdued: Lee Grace is wheeled from hospital to a police vehicle shortly after her arrest in August . All three are expected to soon be transported to Albany, Georgia, where they face a court hearing on May 15. In the robbery case, witnesses say two men and a woman, dressed in black and wearing masks, entered a bank in Valdosta, Georgia on August 2 and fired shots into the ceiling. One carried an assault rifle and an automatic pistol, similar to weapons recovered after the siblings' capture. The trio made off with about $5,200 and had spent about $1,000 of it by the time police caught up with them in Colorado, authorities said. The three also are charged with firing shots at a police officer in Zephyrhills, Florida, some 210 miles south of Valdosta, during a high-speed chase earlier on August 2. In Florida, the siblings are charged with fleeing or eluding and attempted second-degree murder of a law enforcement officer. Convictions could mean life sentences, according to court officials. 22-year-old Ryan also is charged with grand theft auto. Dangerous beauty: Lee Grace was a Florida stripper before joining her brothers on a family crime spree . Exhibitionist: She admitted to 'poor judgment' after helping her brothers commit a string of crimes . Florida authorities said the three had been living together in Lacoochee, Florida, about 45 miles northeast of Tampa, and each had a criminal record. Before the alleged crime spree, Ryan was sentenced to register as a sex offender for sending sexually explicit text messages to an 11-year-old girl. His mother said her son feared the conviction would prohibit him from seeing his newborn son. Lee Grace said in court that her actions were prompted by her desire to protect Ryan. 'My motivation in all of this is I could not lose another sibling,' she said, referring to a sister who died of an illness. 'He's not only my brother. He is my best friend.' Dylan's lawyer, Kobea Becker, also portrayed his client as a loyal family member who was desperate to help his younger brother. But judge Claude Appel said this argument was not a sufficient explanation for the criminal rampage. 'You're saving your brother from a probation sentence, for crying out loud, not a prison sentence,' he said of the siblings' efforts to prevent Ryan from having to register. End of the line: The Dougherty gang was captured after their speeding car went off the highway in Colorado as they were being pursued by police . Path of destruction: Map shows the route of the Dougherty gang to their eventual capture in Colorado . Later, Mr Appel told Ryan that the plan they tried to pull off only works in the movies. 'In reality, this is how the movie ends, serving very lengthy sentences,' the judge said. Bruce Bartlett, chief assistant state attorney for Florida's 6th Judicial District, said authorities there also are seeking extradition. 'We'll be seeking sentences that ensure they spend most of their life in prison, if not all of it, so if and when they were to get out of prison they would no longer pose a threat to everyone,' he said. Ryan told authorities in Colorado that the trio hoped to escape to Mexico. Lee Grace was shot in the knee when she pointed a gun at a police officer after the trio rolled their car on Interstate 25 in Colorado. Prosecutors say Dylan was the one who fired an assault rifle at pursuing officers before the siblings' capture in Colorado, and was also the one who fired at a police officer in Florida and a bank robbery in Georgia. During the hearing, he told the judge he was sorry and didn't want to hurt anyone. 'It is true that I acted out of desperation, and I am sorry for choices that I made,' he said.","Stripper Lee Grace, 29, admits to 'poor judgment' over violent crimes .

Mr Hammond said that although Germany had spent only a little less on . defence in absolute terms than France and Britain, the amount . was much smaller in proportion to its economy. Scroll down for video . Military men: The defence secretary, left, called on Europe's largest economy to increase its military effectiveness, following a meeting with his German counterpart Thomas de Maiziere, right . Speaking after talks in Berlin with German defence minister Thomas de Maiziere, he said he did not expect the country to spend more on the military during the financial crisis, but insisted improvements could be made. He said: 'Due to Germany’s historic reluctance to . deploy and operate overseas, I think it is self-evident that there is . still huge potential in German defence structures to deliver more usable . firepower to the [Nato] alliance,' he said. '[It is about] a willingness to pick up . the burdens that go with having a globally important economy... Germany . recognising that it can’t continue to be the dominant economy in Europe . without also significantly increasing its military capability.' Europe's security and defence needs all the help it can get, with the U.S. focusing increasingly on the Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. has long complained that most . European allies, including Germany, fail to spend the two per cent of . economic output required by NATO on defence. In Europe, only Britain, . France, Greece and Albania meet the target. But with Germany, Britain and much of Europe focused on reducing public debt, that is unlikely to change any time soon. Moving forward: Mr Hammond, second from right, attends a wreath laying ceremony to honour German soldiers killed in action as he meets Mr de Maiziere, right, in Berlin today . 'This is not about the budget but about . turning the forces it is already paying for into a more deployable, more . usable force,' said Mr Hammond. He praised the country’s move to a . professional army from one based on conscription and its involvement in overseas Nato missions in the Balkans and Afghanistan, where the . German contingent is the third largest after U.S. and British forces. Last year, Germany upset its Nato allies by abstaining from a UN Security Council vote authorising military action in Libya. The country also remained firmly on the sidelines during an aerial bombing campaign led by France and Britain. But Mr Hammond called the . Libya issue as a 'minor setback' on the path to what he saw as a more . proactive Germany, which is moving beyond its post-World War . Two inhibitions about sending troops overseas. He said: 'I detect a determination here that .

Pensioners who are comfortably off are being urged to donate their winter fuel payment – worth up to £300 – to those at risk of dying from the cold. All pensioners receive the annual payment from the Government to go towards their heating bills, regardless of their wealth or need. But the fact it is paid to those who can afford to heat their homes – including millionaires and even those who spend winter abroad – has become increasingly controversial. Pensioners who are comfortably off are being urged to donate their winter fuel payment - worth up to £300 - to those at risk of dying from the cold . A recent study suggested as many as 2,700 older Britons die each winter because they cannot afford to heat their homes. Despite sky-high energy prices, the Government has cut winter fuel payments this year from £400 to £300 for the over-80s, and £250 to £200 for all other pensioners. Now, politicians and public figures have joined Saga to support the Surviving Winter Appeal. Supporter: Actor Sir David Jason called on wealthy pensioners to forgo their winter fuel payment . Lib Dem MP Tessa Munt called on David Cameron during Prime Minister’s Questions yesterday to support efforts to make it easier for people to donate by including information on the appeal in letters sent out to advise of payments. Mr Cameron agreed to look at the idea, but warned: ‘I would not want to see any pressure put on people to do something that might not be in their best interests.’ Saga, with the Community Foundation Network, wants the appeal to support local charities and community organisations which can reach those most in need of help. Ros Altmann, Saga’s director general, said: ‘We are particularly concerned about statistics showing that the UK has a higher winter death rate among older people than most other European countries, even those with much colder winters than ours.’ Former Tory MP Ann Widdecombe promised to donate her payment. She said: ‘This small gesture is such an easy and obvious way to support local people in real need and I hope others will follow suit.’ Actor Sir David Jason said: ‘It would be great to think that all those people who are in a position to forgo part or all of their own winter fuel payment could join this great scheme and spread a little warmth.’ Other supporters include Sir Terry Wogan, Sir Michael Parkinson, Jonathan Dimbleby, Rosemary Conley and Dame Cleo Laine.","2,700 older Britons die each winter because they cannot afford to heat their homes ."

Azhar Ahmed, 19, arrives at court today accused of making 'grossly offensive' comments about dead British troops . A teenager today denied posting a grossly offensive message on Facebook about the deaths of six British soldiers in Afghanistan. Azhar Ahmed, 19, appeared at court charged under the Communications Act 2003 with sending a message that was grossly offensive on March 8. A racially-aggravated public order charge was withdrawn at today’s hearing and Ahmed denied the new charge that was put to him. Ahmed, from Ravensthorpe, West Yorkshire, was bailed and will stand trial at Huddersfield Magistrates’ Court on July 3. He has been bailed to an address not given to court. There was a large police presence outside Dewsbury Magistrates’ Court for the hearing today as around 50 far-right protesters staged a noisy demonstration when the defendant arrived and left. A police spokesman said last week that Ahmed, from Ravensthorpe, West Yorkshire, was commenting on the level of attention British soldiers who died in a bomb blast last week received compared to Afghan civilians who have died in the war. The spokesman said: 'He didn’t make his point very well and that is why he has landed himself in bother.' The six soldiers were killed by an improvised explosive device in Lashkar Gah on March 6 in the deadliest single attack on British forces in Afghanistan since 2001. The explosion happened on a routine night patrol on the borders of Helmand and Kandahar provinces. They died in a catastrophic double blast when the huge bomb triggered a second explosion of ammunition inside their Warrior armoured vehicle. It reduced the 40-ton Warrior to a ‘riddled shell’, meaning it was impossible for any of its occupants to survive.Sergeant Nigel Coupe, 33, of 1st .

Britain has dodged a double-dip recession but the crisis in the eurozone is deepening with unemployment at a record high, according to the latest figures. The UK economy grew by 0.3 per cent in the first three months of the year, having shrunk by the same amount at the end of 2011, the British Chambers of Commerce said. The return to growth – which means Britain has avoided a new recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of decline – came as factory output rose at its fastest pace for ten months in March. Soaring: Graph shows unemployment across the European Union as a whole . But the BCC business lobby group said . the recovery was still ‘much too slow’ and called for ‘forceful’ measures to kickstart the economy. It comes after the respected Organisation for Economic Cooperation and . Development last week declared Britain was back in recession. ‘The UK economy is still facing huge challenges and the recovery is much too slow,’ said BCC director general John Longworth. ‘The UK has the potential to recover but to achieve that the Government has to set businesses free to grow.’ Soaring: Unemployment in the 17-nation eurozone today soared to . 17.1million - the highest level since the currency was founded in 1999 . (bottom line). The top line shows unemployment across the 27-nation . European Union where there are 24.5million people out of work . The BCC’s quarterly economic survey, published today, predicts growth of . just 0.6 per cent in Britain this year – compared to the 0.8 per cent . expected by the Treasury. It warned that high oil and food prices are hitting family budgets and . added that ‘the unresolved problems in the eurozone may trigger new . upheavals later this year’. Eurostat, the official statistics agency in Brussels, said unemployment . in the 17 countries that adopted the euro had hit its highest since the . currency was launched in 1999. The jobless rate rose to 10.8 per cent in February, from 10.7 per cent . the previous month, with 17.1million people out of work, nearly . 1.5million more than a year ago. Unemployment is 8.4 per cent in . Britain. In Spain, youth unemployment hit an eye-watering 50.5 per cent – . meaning that more than half of young Spaniards who want a job cannot . find work. It reinforced concerns that the debt-riddled eurozone is back in . recession after gross domestic product fell 0.3 per cent in the final . three months of 2011. Separate figures show a bigger-than-expected manufacturing downturn in . the eurozone. Economic research group Markit said its main index of . factory output – where anything below 50 represents contraction – fell . to a three-month low of 47.7 in March. The slump in the troubled periphery spread to Germany and France, the . region’s powerhouse economies, according to the report. Howard Archer, . chief European and UK economist at think-tank IHS Global Insight, said: . ‘It looks odds-on that eurozone GDP contracted again in the first . quarter of 2012. ‘And the prospects for the second quarter of 2012 currently hardly look rosy.’ But hopes are rising that Britain has avoided recession, despite last week’s gloomy report by the OECD. Chaos: A policeman tries to escape a petrol bomb during rioting in Athens last year as economic troubles worsen in the eurozone . Markit said its index of factory output for the UK rose to a 10-month . high of 52.1 in March, as strong exports to Africa, south-east Asia and . Japan offset weak demand in Europe. Lee Hopley, chief economist at the manufacturing organisation EEF, said: . ‘Despite further evidence of weakness in eurozone markets, UK . manufacturers are looking beyond this and securing orders growth in . non-traditional emerging markets.’ The BCC urged ministers to take . ‘radical’ steps to bolster growth, including a new war on red tape and . creating a state-backed bank to boost lending to small businesses. ‘The results of the quarterly economic survey point to a welcome but . modest improvement in the economic situation,’ said BCC chief economist . David Kern. ‘The UK economy will likely avoid a recession. However, growth is likely . to remain low for some time, and a return to a more normal pace is . unlikely until 2013. ‘Every effort must be made to boost growth and empower the private sector to create jobs.’ Labour shadow Treasury minister Owen Smith MP said: ‘After flatlining . since George Osborne’s spending review in 2010, our economy should be . doing more than just recovering the output lost at the end of last . year.’ Senior MPs have attacked David  Cameron’s handling of the European Union, saying he got nothing in return for letting eurozone countries proceed with a new fiscal union. The European Scrutiny Committee denounced a new treaty of 25 European nations as ‘illegal’ and said Mr Cameron was right to veto British involvement. But the committee has found that the Government failed to use its leverage to extract meaningful concessions. A report published today has found that Mr Cameron and his advisers are acting in a ‘profoundly unwise’ manner by giving the project the green light. The treaty will see 25 EU countries – all EU nations except the UK and the Czechs – submit to tough new spending limits. But the committee found that the  fiscal compact ‘does little towards solving the Eurozone crisis, other perhaps than providing some comfort to international markets’. The UK Government first said it would be wrong for the 25 countries to use EU institutions such as the European Court of Justice to police the agreement, when they are supposed to be controlled by all 27 EU countries. But Mr Cameron gave ground last month, reserving Britain’s right to complain if the institutions are used in a way that would undermine the European single market. The committee said that if the Government believes the new treaty is unlawful if should say so and extract something in return for nodding it through. It concludes: ‘The Government has made clear that it has reservations about the legality of what has been done, but the question of what it intends to do remains unsatisfactorily unresolved.’ The Foreign Office declined to comment.","Spain now has unemployment of 23.7% .

'The experience of memories about their lives has been one of tears,' he told Good Morning America. 'And every time I open up my computer and look at pictures of them, I am moved.' Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Matthew Badger, whose three daughters were killed in a house fire on Christmas Day, has talked about his grief following their deaths - and how he has channelled it for good . Together: Mr Badger with his daughters (left to right) seven-year-old twins Gracie and Sarah and nine-year-old Lily. He recounted how happy they had been during Christmas celebrations before their deaths . But Mr Badger, who was estranged from the girls' mother, added that he has channelled his grief into something positive, setting up a fund for school arts programs in their names. The three girls died with their grandparents, Lomer and Pauline Johnson, as a fire sparked by fireplace embers tore through their mother's home in Stamford, Connecticut on December 25. Matthew Badger said he struggled to come to terms with the news: 'It was very difficult to see. Why did this happen? I mean, it doesn't make any sense. And I'd just seen them the day before.' He recounted the Christmas celebration they had enjoyed in his New York apartment a day earlier.

'It was . dancing. We had our own Christmas tree. We . had opened our presents [and] they were all very happy.' Just hours after the three giggling girls posed for photographs in front of the tree, they left for their mother's home. That night, with the youngsters concerned Santa Claus would not be able to get down the chimney, embers from the fireplace were put outside. Yet they were still hot and sparked the 5 a.m. blaze. The girls and their grandparents attempted to escape but were forced back inside. Later reports suggested the home had fire alarms, but they had been disconnected during renovations.

Mrs Badger, photographed weeping uncontrollably on the day of her daughters' funerals, reportedly attempted to commit suicide after the deaths. She is now in deep isolated mourning. Yet Matthew Badger has sought to come to terms with the deaths by creating something positive in his daughters' memories.

'I need to try and make them have . made a mark on the planet, and not have just died in vain.'

The California dairy cow found to have mad cow disease had been euthanized after it became lame and started lying down, federal officials revealed in their latest update on the discovery. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also said Thursday that the animal was 10 years and seven months old. A spokesman for U.S. Rep. Devin Nunes of California had said Wednesday that the sick cow was 5 years old. It came from a dairy farm in Tulare County, the nation's No. 1 dairy-producing county. Euthanized: A cow was killed after it was found to have mad cow disease . The USDA didn't elaborate on the cow's symptoms other than to say it was 'humanely euthanized after it developed lameness and became recumbent'. Outward signs of the disease can include unsteadiness and incoordination. Routine testing at a transfer facility showed the dead Holstein, which was destined for a rendering plant, had mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Rendering plants deal with 'leftover' parts of cows that aren't suitable for human consumption - such as the hair and hooves. In the recent 'pink slime' scandal a small amount of rendered meat was found to have been used in some foods. The results were announced Tuesday. It was the fourth case of mad cow disease ever discovered in the U.S. Unsteady: The 10-year-old cow was killed after it became lame and started lying down . Animals at greater risk for the disease include those with symptoms of neurological disease, 'downer' animals at slaughterhouses, animals that die at dairies or cattle ranches for unknown reasons, and cows more than 2 1/2 years old, because BSE occurs in older cows. U.S. health officials say there is no risk to the food supply, as the California cow was never destined for the meat market but on Thursday Indonesia became the first country to suspend imports of U.S. beef following the discovery of the infected cow. On Friday government officials in South Korea were carrying out checks on all U.S. imports. The infected cow is believed to have developed 'atypical' BSE from a random mutation, something that scientists know happens occasionally. Suspicious: South Korean government inspectors check the imported U.S. beef at a cold storage on Friday. On Thursday Indonesia became the first country to suspend imports of U.S. beef . Somehow, a protein the body normally harbors folds into an abnormal shape called a prion, setting off a chain reaction of misfolds that eventually kills brain cells. In other countries, BSE's spread through herds was blamed on making cattle feed using recycled meat and bone meal from infected cows, so the U.S. has long banned feed containing such material. The last two cases found in the U.S. were atypical as well.","Cow from top dairy-producing county was 10 years old when it was euthanized .

Rival: Alexis Tsipras, leader of the Radical Left Coalition party, yesterday met with leader of the election-winning New Democracy party, Antonio Samaras . Greece’s radical left-wing Syriza party insisted the country’s commitment to austerity was no longer valid after voters turned their backs on bailout deals, as its leader tried to form a new coalition government on Tuesday. Alexis Tsipras, head of the Radical Left Coalition that came a surprise second in Sunday’s election, appeared determined to act on the punishing message sent by voters fed-up with austerity by defying stern warnings from the European Union and Germany for the country to stick to its agreed bailout deal or risk default. He called on Greece’s two main party leaders, the conservative New Democracy and Socialist Pasok to reverse their support for the multi-billion euro bailout that is keeping Greece from bankruptcy. 'There is no way we will attempt to sneak back what the Greek people threw out in the election,' he said, referring to a slew of recent austerity measures which include drastic pension and salary cuts and tax hikes. 'The public has voted in large masses against the barbaric policies of the EU memorandum,' said Tsipras, who is determined to seek a left-led coalition which will reject the bailout terms. His goal will be to win over the Communist Party of Greece, KKE, but his efforts may prove fruitless, after the communists already rejected any possibility of cooperation with Syriza. The Democractic Left, seen as a more moderate and pro-Europe party already gave Syriza its backing. Voters ended up punishing mainstream parties, New Democracy and the Socialist Pasok, for their handling of the financial crisis which has forced the country in a fifth year of recession and encountered record unemployment. Instead, the electorate directed their support to several smaller parties, ranging from moderate leftists to the extreme right fascist party Golden Dawn accused for attacks against immigrants. A large proportion, disillusioned with the entire political system which they see as being corrupt refused to even vote, with abstention recorded at an all time high at 35 per cent. Tsipras will be given three days to seek coalition partners to clinch a deal before the mandate is passed to former finance minister Evangelos Venizelos, whose Socialist Pasok party came in third. If no agreement can be found new elections will be called, probably for June. Disenchanted: Supporters of the Left Coalition party applaud as they watch exit polls at a party's kiosk in Athens on Sunday, as voters deserted governing parties . Divided citizens: New Democracy party leader Antonis Samaras won the election, but his party was unable to form a government . More than six in ten Greeks voted against austerity measures. Of these, some put their faith in neo-Nazi party Golden Dawn - led by Nikolaos Michaloliakos - which won seven per cent of the vote. Fresh elections would only increase fears the country's deficit-cutting program could be derailed. They could also hinder Europe's painful efforts to resolve the beleaguered country's debt crisis. Shares were hammered by nearly seven per cent on the Athens Stock Exchange yesterday, and were down a further 1.3 per cent by midday trading today. The government, however, managed to raise 1.3billion euros ($1.69bn) in a debt auction today, with Greece's short-term borrowing costs continuing to creep up. It sold six-month treasury bills at an interest rate of 4.69 per cent, compared with a 4.55 per cent rate at an auction last month.

President Obama will apparently forego his annual trip to Martha’s Vineyard this year, making it the first time he hasn’t gone since he began his presidency nearly four years ago. Sources told the Boston Globe that the president and his family will not be coming to the picturesque island off of Cape Cod, as the complex travel plans sent in by White House staffers have been cancelled. It is likely Mr Obama is earnest to be seen as approachable and down-to-earth as he attempts to paint Mitt Romney as wealthy and out-of-touch with the lower and middle classes. Spinning: President Obama and daughter Malia ride bikes in West Tisbury in Martha's Vineyard last August; sources say the president and his family will not go to the vineyard this year . On the green: President Obama, seen last August playing golf at Farm Neck Golf Club in Oak Bluffs, was lambasted by some Republicans for taking the 10-day vacation during hard economic times . And with only four months until what will most certainly be a bitter campaign for the White House, he may find his time is better served off the golf course and in the Oval Office. When he took time off to go to the well-heeled summer colony last year, he was hounded by some Republicans, who said he should have forgone his vacation to spend time fixing the dire economic situation. Sgt. Thomas Medeiros told the Globe: ‘The word I have is that they are not coming this year,’ adding that he heard the news from the Secret Service. Peter Martell, who owns the Wesley Hotel on the picturesque island, told the Cape Cod Times much of the same. ‘We had some (presidential reservations) early on, but they got cancelled,’ he said, noting that his hotel would often be backed by the president’s staffers. Even if the president had followed through with his scheduled vacation, the lodging at which he and his family stayed would no longer be available. The Blue Heron Farm in West Tisbury was purchased by celebrated British architect Baron Foster. See you soon? Mr Obama waves to the crowd in front of the takeout window of Nancy's restaurant last August; without the president and his staffers, the island will undoubtedly be much quieter . Easy times: Quaint houses line a street of Martha's Vineyard, which is located off the coast of Cape Cod in Massachusetts . He and Lady Foster bought the estate last November for $21.9million from Sotheby’s, according to the Globe. Prior to that, the sprawling 30-acre estate could be rented for $50,000 a week. The White House declined to comment on the matter. Conversely, presumptive Republican candidate Mitt Romney started the week vacationing with the entire Romney clan at Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire. The annual sporting event, held at the sprawling $8million estate, involves a triathlon of biking, swimming and running, as well as more unusual activities such as a nail hammering game. Mr Romney bought the estate, now valued at approximately $10million, back in 1997 for $2.5million. Cool runnings: Presumptive Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and wife Ann enjoyed a lark on the lake on Lake Winnipesaukee in earlier this week . Home sweet summer home: Romney's home on Lake Winnipesaukee is valued at more than $10million . The property, spread over 13-acres, boasts a six-bedroom house, a horse stable with guest apartments above it, a $630,000 boat house, tennis and volleyball courts and a 768 feet long shoreline. Presidents and presidential hopefuls have never had an easy time over taking time off.Former president George W. Bush was on the receiving end of harsh criticism for taking extended trips to his ranch in Texas. According to CBS News, he spent 490 days total at the 1,600 acre Crawford property during his two terms as president. His presidency was marred by his belated response to Hurricane Katrina, in which he remained on vacation in Texas for more than a day after the storm struck.","President Obama will not make annual trip to Martha's Vineyard this summer, sources said .

A mother has come face-to-face with the killer of her three-year-old son, and has described the extraordinary moment she took hold of his hands, praying that they would cause no more hurt. Sharletta Evans, from Denver, Colorado, has spent the past 17 years trying to come to terms with the death of her son Casson after he was shot dead in a drive-by shooting while asleep her car in 1995. His killer was Raymond Johnson, who is currently serving life without parole for the murder he committed aged just 16. Brave: Sharletta Evans holds a photograph of her son Casson, killed in a drive-by shooting in 1995 by Raymond Johnson, right, who was 16 at the time. She has met him to discuss the impact his crime has had on her life . But just a few weeks ago Ms Evans decided to meet the now 33-year-old, in a bid to complete her grieving process, becoming the first person to take part in the Colorado Department of Corrections pilot programme in restorative justice. She has now spoken about the heart-wrenching meeting, and how at the end she took hold of Johnson's hands, praying that they 'no longer be hands of destruction'. The mother-of-two spent six months preparing for the visit, alongside her older son Calvin Hurd, now 23, who was six . when the gunshots hit the car where he sat sleeping with his brother. Part of this process was recollecting the day her son was killed, examining emotions she felt about every aspect of the crime. Victim: Casson was sleeping in the car with his brother when he was shot in the head in Denver . Ms Evans had driven to a north east Denver duplex to collect her grandniece as there had been a drive-by shooting the previous night. But while she left her sons in the car and went indoors, a volley of 12 shots were fired at the house and . car and one bullet, fired by Johnson, hit Casson in the head. When Ms Evans was finally ready to visit Johnson, one day in May, she was overcome with emotion just seconds before the . meeting. However, she recalled to the Denver Post, how, at that minute, Johnson saw her in the doorway and rose from . his chair. She told the newspaper: 'He . dropped his head and shook it with such sorrow, as if . to say, 'Look at what I've done to this woman.' That gave me the . courage to start moving.' During the meeting the pair recounted . the crime from their individual points of view and Ms Evans spoke about . her son, what he meant to her and her family, and at times talked with anger. She also revealed that she had forgiven him at his trial, after realising that his crime did not mean he was a completely bad person. He said that he'd become a better man in prison. She added: 'And . he asked me, ''Why do you think God showed you who I really am and . didn't show my mother or grandmother?''' When the pair went to part . company, Johnson stood and extended his arms and Ms Evans asked him to . turn his palms facing up. She took hold of his hands and . prayed, saying it was his hands which caused the harm. She said: 'The fact . that he actually pulled the . trigger, it was something about the hands that kept coming to me.' She added: 'I . prayed that they would cause no more harm, that they'd be . hands of comfort, that they would bring help and serve people and that . they would no longer be hands of destruction but hands that bring life.' Landscaper Mr Hurd, who also went . through six months of preparation for the visit, said he took part in . the process out of concern for his mother and had few memories of his . brother. He said he was skeptical about how remorseful Johnson would be, but said the visit proved his remorse was real. Ms Evans, who has vowed to continue meeting Johnson, she felt the need to meet Casson's . killer after 'reaching a peak in the healing process'. She has received . help and support through counselling and her church for the last 17 years but felt the meeting would offer her complete closure in the grieving process. Remarkably, she thinks he deserves a second chance and said she would not be 'at peace' if he spent the rest of his life in prison. She said she wanted to see him back in society, functioning as a normal adult. The pilot project has no impact on . the defendant's sentence but experts who met with Ms Evans and Johnson . before and after the visit said such meetings can transform offenders . and make them less of a management risk.","Sharletta Evans's three-year-old son was shot dead in a drive-by-shooting .

Arrests: Expert David Anderson QC, pictured, has said that police are acting earlier to 'clear the decks' of potential terrorists before London 2012 . Police are trying to arrest as many suspected terrorists as possible to 'clear the decks' before the Olympics, one of Britain's top QCs said today. David Anderson, the UK's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, says the security services are 'defending further up the field' to avoid any 7/7 or 9/11-style attacks when London hosts the Games later this month. 'What one may be seeing as the Olympics approach is a willingness to try and clear the decks in some respects,' Mr Anderson told BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House programme. 'We're a long way from zero risk, we probably always will be, but the police are getting to hear about things long before they used to and I think that gives them choices which perhaps they didn't have before. 'Do they let things run, just keeping an eye on it, picking up evidence with a view to a criminal prosecution? Or do they move in earlier to disrupt it? 'The Olympics are potentially a major target and you are seeing the police, perhaps in a marginal case what they might do is decide to intervene a little bit earlier.' Some 14 suspected terrorists were arrested last week, but he added: 'We shouldn't lose sight of the big picture, which is that things were a good deal worse six or seven years ago than they are now.' Meanwhile detectives have been granted more time to question a 22-year-old woman over a suspected terror plot in the UK. Officers from Scotland Yard's counter terrorism command now have until Friday to hold and grill the woman, who was arrested in Hackney, east London, on Saturday. Danger: Police and MI5 are vigilantly trying to stop terrorists targeting the Olympic Park and other venues . Five men arrested last week in connection with the same plot, including British Muslim convert Richard Dart, can also be held until Thursday after Westminster magistrates granted a series of warrants of further detention, police said. A seventh person held in the raids, a 30-year-old woman, was released without charge on Saturday. Dart, 29, who changed his name to Salahuddin al-Britani after converting, was one of the six people arrested over the suspected terror plot last Thursday. Allegations: British Muslim convert Richard Dart, now Salahuddin Al Britani, is one of six arrested last week over an alleged terror plot . He is believed to have been one of three people detained in Ealing, west London, and was arrested in the street. He appeared in a BBC Three documentary, My Brother The Islamist, made by his stepbrother Robb Leech last year, which described how Dart, originally from Weymouth, Dorset, had been converted by controversial cleric Anjem Choudary. In the documentary he spoke of his support for jihad and sharia law. The others detained in Ealing were a 21-year-old man and a 30-year-old woman held at separate home addresses. The woman has since been released without charge. Three men living just over a mile from the Olympic site in Stratford, east London, were also arrested. The men, aged 18, 24 and 26, who are believed to be members of the same Bangladeshi family, were detained in a raid on their home. The six, who include a former police community support officer, remain in custody at a south-east London police station on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism. The alleged plan involved Islamist extremists with potential targets in the UK, but was not linked to the Olympics, it is understood.

The suburban mother suspected of running an upscale Manhattan brothel was back in court today to plead for her freedom as her lawyer told the judge his client is so broke she doesn't have 'two nickels to rub together'. Anna Gristina, 44, who was arrested last month on a single prostitution charge after a five-year investigation, was said to have raked in more than $10million in the 15 years she allegedly ran her high-end brothel, charging clients up to $2,000 an hour. But in court today, her lawyer Peter Gleason told the judge that the 44-year-old - who wore the same black-and-white patterned suit she sported at her first court hearing last week - said she is actually on the brink of poverty and cannot even afford to post bail. Hearing: Anna Gristina was back in court this morning with her attorney Peter Gleason so a judge could decide whether or not she is entitled to court-paid defence . Shackled: Her attorney, pictured, will also ask if he can put up his Tribeca loft as collateral so the mother-of-four can be released on bail . In an unusual move with was dubbed 'unethical' by prosecutors, he offered up his own $2.5million loft . apartment as a 'gilded cage' for her to remain under a Dominique Strauss Kahn-type house arrest. A judge will determine at a hearing on Thursday whether she can be freed on bail . With her hands cuffed behind her back, she appeared with three attorneys, looking more like an ordinary suburban mom rather than the owner of a millionaire prostitution empire, as prosecutors allege. Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan was trying to decide whether the 'soccer mom' should be released on bail and adjourned the hearing until Thursday. Questions were also raised today about whether or not Gristina is entitled to a court-paid defence. Judge Merchuan said: 'The allegation is that she made over $10 million, possibly $15 million dollars, and that she has money ""squirreled away"".' He then asked Gleason why he should allow Scottish-born Gristina to pick and choose her lawyers after the attorney made it clear Gristina wanted to replace court-appointed lawyer Richard Siracusa. 'She doesn't have two nickels to rub . together, your honor,' Gleason said, pointing out that prosecutors . have produced no evidence of Gristina's so-called hidden riches and that she is entitled to free legal representation. The judge told Gleason his client would not be getting preferential treatment but would keep the tax-payer funded lawyer until someone presented him with evidence that she was not broke. He also denied her additional request to . interview other prospective lawyers within the program. Later in the hearing there were ugly and farcical scenes between . Gleason and Siracusa as relations . between the two went into meltdown in front of the judge. At one point, Siracusa dubbed Gleason 'a hindrance' whilst Mr . Gleason he called for him to be removed from the case over a . threatening email he allegedly sent. As he postponed the hearing, Judge Marchan ruled that both lawyers should remain on the case for the time being. Gleason, an ex-police officer, is working pro-bono on the case and doesn't have a lot of experience with criminal trials. Racy: Anna Gristina poses seductively with her . third husband Kelvin Gorr, a photo she posted online as she boasted to . her friends back in Scotland that she was 'building an empire' in New . York . In court last week: The mother-of-four attempted to hide from cameras when she appeared in State Supreme Court on March 6 charged with promoting prostitution . Gristina's bail was set at $2million . after prosecutors told the judge she was a high flight risk since she . had property and friends in different countries and has a British . passport. It is extremely unusual, but not unethical, for a lawyer to post bail for his client as Gleason has offered to do. It is also believed he will allow his client, her husband Kevin and four children to stay at his condo in the city if she is ordered not to leave by the judge. Gristina is offering to wear a monitoring ankle bracelet if the judge signs off on the deal. Meanwhile, Gristina's co-defendant, former matchmaking service recruiter Jaynie Baker, remains at large but has hired a veteran defense lawyer, Robert Gottlieb. It is believed she is planning to hand herself in today or tomorrow. Speaking to the New York Post last . week from her cell in Rikers Prison last week, the mother-of-four denied . that she reaped millions from a prostitution ring, claiming it was . often hard to make ends meet and adding: 'I can show you my bills.' She . added that she hated the thought of her children - particularly her . nine-year-old son - knowing she was in prison, saying: 'I just don’t . want my kids to see me in here.' Speaking . from Rikers Island - where she is locked in solitary confinement - she . recounted the hours-long questioning she received from prosecutors . following her arrest on February 22. Accused: Jaynie Mae Baker, allegedly Anna . Gristina's partner, has been on the run from police but she is expected . to hand herself in today . New York: 304 East 78th Street, the alleged Upper East Side brothel where accused Manhattan Madam Anna Gristina reportedly ran a high-class escort service . Gristina, 44, was later charged with a single count of prostitution and believes the meager charge - which came after a five-year probe by investigators - proves they have nothing on her. Gristina told the Post: 'They’re trying to sweat me out. They are clearly trying to break me... I’d bite my tongue off before I’d tell them anything.' Her denial comes after the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office said it recorded her speaking of her close relationships with police officers and federal agents who kept authorities off her back. They allegedly kept her out of the frame even during high profile arrests, such as that of former Governor Eliot Spitzer in 2008, who was this week accused of tipping her off through a contact. She admitted that she does have high-profile friends, but would often exaggerate her relationships with them during discussions to make herself 'sound better'. She recounted the questioning by police as relentless and how her pleas for a lawyer fell on deaf ears. She believes the police were trying to force a case rather than having anything concrete on her, telling the Post: 'If I’m such a big, high-profile madam, making all this money, and they had to investigate me for five years, why did they arrest me on a single promoting-prostitution charge - and only after I refused to talk to them?'","Attorney tells judge Anna Gristina is broke .

Bo Guagua spoke out for the first time since his father lost his job as a top Communist Party boss after his mother was accused of killing a British businessman. The 24-year-old, who had been studying for a master’s degree at the Kennedy School of Government but is now in hiding, declined to comment on the probe. Speaking out: Bo Guagua, Mr Bo and Mrs Gu's, son has publicly commented . for the first time since his parents came under investigation to deny . rumours about a hedonistic lifesyle he is said to have enjoyed at Oxford .

Prestigious: Mr Bo had been studying for a masters degree as Harvard Kennedy School of Government, above . But he hit out at claims that he had cashed in on his parents’ wealth and influence by spending more partying than studying while he was at Oxford University. He became renowned for hosting champagne and shisha parties in his room at Balliol College, where he read Politics, Philosophy and Economics. It was also claimed that his performance fell short of what was expected and he was made to sit ‘penal’ exams. But in an extraordinary twist – and in an astonishing example the influence of his parents before their spectacular fall from grace – Chinese officials tried to intervene to prevent tutors from disciplining him over his lack of work, it is understood. Accused: Gu Kailai is said to have confessed to and Neil Heywood are said to had an affair due to her husband's 'lack of passion' However, Mr Bo – the son of former . Chongqing party boss Bo Xilai and his lawyer wife Gu Kailai – did not . refer to all these allegations. In a statement published by the Harvard Crimson student newspaper, he: . In the statement, he said he felt . compelled to provide ‘an account of the facts’ in response to . speculation about his private life and family. He wrote: ‘Recently, there has been . increasing attention from the press on my private life. As a result of . these speculations, I feel responsible to the public to provide an . account of the facts. ‘I am . deeply concerned about the events surrounding my family, but I have no . comments to make regarding the ongoing investigation. ‘It . is impossible to address all of the rumours and allegations about . myself, but I will state the facts regarding some of the most pertinent . claims.’ Claims: Former Chongqing police chief Wang Lijun, fled the city in February, is said to have revealed to American diplomats that Mrs Gu confessed 'I did it' three times . Questions: Chinese officials are investigating . whether Mr Heywood was poisoned with cyanide after falling out with Mr . Bo (right) and his wife Gu Kailai (left) Allegations last week claimed that Mr Heywood had hidden details of Bo Xilai's financial dealings with his lawyers in Britain . He also sought to . dampen speculation about financial improprieties over his costly . overseas tuition, explaining the fees had been covered by ‘scholarships . earned independently, and my mother's generosity from the savings she . earned from her years as a successful lawyer and writer’. Before . Oxford, Mr Bo attended Harrow, the same the prestigious private school . near London that murder victim Neil Heywood had studied at. Mr . Heywood, 41, a business ‘fixer’ who had known the Bo family for a . decade, was found murdered in a hotel in Chongqing in November. Today, it was claimed that Mrs Gu, who was allegedly his mistress, had confessed ‘I did it’ to a former Chinese police chief. She is said to have told Wang Lijun she was in the hotel room during the ‘gruesome’ poisoning, according to American diplomats. Mr . Wang, who ran the city’s police force fled there in February, . apparently in fear of his life, to the U.S. consulate in nearby Chengdu. He is said to have told diplomats that . Mr Heywood was held down in a Chongqing hotel room in . November and forced to drink cyanide. Afterwards, Mrs Gu – the wife of . former rising star Bo Xilai, who has been has been stripped of all his . roles within the party - allegedly confessed to the crime. Questions remain: It is thought that Mr Heywood . was killed in one of the mountain-top hotel's £600-a-night villas, but . details of his demise are sketchy . Suspicious: The reception area of the Nanshan . Lijing Holiday Hotel in Chongqing, China, where British businessman Neil . Heywood was found dead . ‘Gu said ”I did it” three times to Wang,’ a diplomatic source told The Daily Telegraph. ‘It was a gruesome scene. Heywood spat the cyanide out and they had to give him more.’ Mr Wang reportedly gave an almost . identical account to the Chinese authorities after he left and these . accounts have spread in official circles within and outside China. Mr Heywood had, before his death, been . raising cash to build an £80million shopping centre dedicated to British . goods. Mrs Gu is alleged to have started an . affair with him after she was denied ‘any normal passion’ from her . husband, Wang Kang, a Chongqing scholar with contacts inside Mr Bo's . circle, told The Times last week.

To the cells: Another suspected terrorist is arrested in separate raids in Marseille . It follows the arrests of 19 people last week in the ongoing nationwide crackdown, ordered by Nicolas Sarkozy, that comes two weeks after police sharpshooters gunned down mass murderer Mohamed Merah.

Murderer: The arrests come two weeks after police sharpshooters gunned down Mohamed Merah who killed three Jewish school children, a rabbi and three soldiers in a spate of attacks around Toulouse . Sarkozy, a former interior minister, has been accused by some opponents of capitalising on the Islamist threat for electoral purposes even though only 20 percent of voters consider it their main concern, surveys show.

British soldiers due to fly home to their loved ones grab a last dose of the Afghan sun before returning to bleak old Blighty. As it turns out, however, they need not worry – for Britain is predicted to be one of the hottest places in Europe this weekend. Warm Mediterranean breezes blowing in from the Continent could push temperatures to 21c (70f) in places. At ease: Soldiers from 8th Platoon, C Company 1st Battalion the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment cram in a last 'Operation Bronze' as they panic tan on top of a wall at Patrol Base (PB) Clifton, in Helmand Province, Afghanistan .

By contrast, Malaga and Majorca will manage only 18c (64f). The UK will also be hotter than Corfu, Barcelona and Faro in Portugal, and about the same temperature as Athens and Rome. And as the clocks go forward on Sunday morning, marking the beginning of British Summer Time, the country – particularly in the west – will feel like it is summer already, with temperatures 7c above average. But don’t get too used to the good weather – last year’s warm spring was followed by a washout summer. Met Office forecaster Helen Chivers said: ‘We are set for a lovely weekend, with temperatures reaching 17-18c and even 21c in some places. There will be plenty of sunshine around. ‘This is down to an area of high pressure to the east of us bringing in warm air from France and the Mediterranean. ‘Sunday will start off a bit grey and misty but we’ll find that clearing away and bringing in warm sunshine again.’ Miss .

But although the temperatures are unseasonal, they won’t make the record books. The hottest March day was 25.6c (78f) at Mepal in Cambridgeshire on March 29, 1968. The . dry conditions spell further difficulties for water companies, which . fear a prolonged drought and have already warned of hosepipe bans.

Billionaire Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos has discovered the F-1 rockets that launched Apollo 11's historic 1969 mission to the moon and now plans on digging them up from the bottom of the ocean. Bezos says he's funded a successful mission to track the five F-1 engines and now plans to retrieve one or more so they can be publicly displayed. The Seattle billionaire posted the announcement on his Bezos Expeditions website. Groundbreaking: NASA's mighty Saturn V rocket was used to launch the historic Apollo 11 . 'I'm excited to report that, using state-of-the-art deep sea sonar, the team has found the Apollo 11 engines lying 14,000 feet below the surface, and we're making plans to attempt to raise one or more of them from the ocean floor,' Bezos wrote in the statement. 'We don't know yet what condition these engines might be in - they hit the ocean at high velocity and have been in salt water for more than 40 years,' he added. 'On the other hand, they're made of tough stuff, so we'll see.' Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos says his team has located the rocket engines that launched the Apollo II toward the moon . The F-1 engines on Apollo's Saturn V rocket dropped into the Atlantic Ocean minutes after they launched astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins on their historic voyage to the moon. More than 40 years later, the Saturn V remains the largest and most powerful engine ever built, according to space.com. Each of its five 12-foot F-1 engines is capable of generating about 32 million horsepower, burning 6,000 pounds of rocket fuel every second. Bezos says on his website that as a five-year-old he watched in amazement as Apollo II launched into space, but a short time ago did he begin to wonder about the rockets. 'A year or so ago, I started to wonder, with the right team of undersea pros, could we find and potentially recover the F-1 engines that started mankind's mission to the moon?' Bezos wrote on his website. Bezos acknowledges the engines belong to NASA and hopes that one day they will be displayed at the Smithsonian and perhaps at the Museum of Flight in his native Seattle. His statement concludes: 'NASA is one of the few institutions I know that can inspire 5-year-olds. 'It sure inspired me, and with this endeavor, maybe we can inspire a few . more youth to invent and explore.' The Apollo 11 Saturn V launched Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins on their historic voyage to the moon . Exhibit: A Saturn V like the one used in the launch of Apollo 11 draws crowds to the Kennedy Space Center . The Apollo 11 is Bezos' second space-centred project. Blue Origin, his spaceflight company partially funded by NASA, is developing a commercial spaceship capable of flying people to and from the Earth's orbit. This mission is just the latest in a long line of exploration attempts launched by deep-pocketed adventurers. Last week film director James Cameron dived to the furthest depths of the Pacific, while Virgin founder Richard Branson is hoping to start the world's first commercial 'space airline'.

She is in prison for running away with her boyfriend who her parents had not chosen for marriage. Sleeping on the floor are (front of picture) Sooniya, five, and Zohra, one. The pair are also the children of prisoners . Afghanistan has made little progress in the way it treats women in the past decade, a Human Rights watch report claims. Hundreds languish in jail for so-called 'moral crimes' such as running away from abusive husbands or forced marriages. Those who leave are, in many cases, treated as adulterers and end up in prison. HRW even found one case where a woman . was in prison after being stabbed in the head, chest and arms with a screwdriver by her husband . because she had invited another man to their house. The husband remains at large because the injuries were not life threatening. Some 400 women are in jail for ‘moral crimes’. The statistics are particularly shocking as they come more than ten years after the US-led invasion of Afghanistan. One of stated aims of regime change in the Taliban-controlled country was to improve the desperate plight of women. Under the Taliban, they were forced to wear body-and-face . covering burkas and were not allowed out of the house without a male . family member as an escort. The . HRW's report said police, prosecutors and judges routinely ignore women’s . accusations of abuse, arguing even in the face of physical evidence that . women are either lying about the abuse or making it seem more severe . than it was. 'What’s needed . first is the political will on behalf of the Afghan government to . prosecute violence against women,' Kenneth Roth, executive director of . Human Rights Watch, told reporters in Kabul. 'Police, . with a crime victim sitting in front of them, see a criminal instead,' said Heather Barr, the group’s Afghanistan researcher and author of the . report. The report is based on interviews in October and November with 58 women and girls in Afghanistan. President Hamid Karzai has announced a blanket pardon of woman in recent times but the jails keep filling up. Plight: Zarghona, seen here with her seven-month-old son Balal in Kabul's jail, was imprisoned because she left her first husband who abused her and forced her into prostitution . A spokesman for the Supreme Court said that men and women are treated equally in Afghanistan’s laws and courts. 'The . courts of this country hear equally cases of all Afghan citizens, . without paying attention to whether they are men or women,' spokesman . Abdul Wakhil Omery. He . said the chief justice had seen the Human Rights Watch report, but did . not find specific enough evidence to prove wrongdoing or negligence in . any individual cases. Women's rights activists have said that they are worried President Karzai will abandon promises to protect women's rights as he tries to court the Taliban for peace talks. Neither the Interior Ministry, which controls the police and the . prisons, nor the attorney general's office responded to calls seeking . comment. Life behind bars: Zakiya, 30, who is accused of adultery, sews while she holds her daughter Zohra, one, in Kabul's jail . A spokesman for the Supreme Court said that men and women are treated equally in Afghanistan's laws and courts. Afghanistan is widely regarded as one of the worst places in the world to be a woman. A report on domestic violence compiled in 2008 estimated that 87 per cent of females had been sexually, physically or psychologically abused at some point. Half of these women said they had been physically abused. The UN estimates that 70 to 80 per cent of Afghan marriages are forced with girls frequently married at a very early age. There is also a high maternal mortality rate. HRW says that an Afghan woman dies every two hours from pregnancy-related causes.

The jail will go back to its original name of the Arapahoe County Justice Centre Detention Facility. Sullivan was sentenced only a week ago after he was caught on video in a police sting. The jail was rededicated and renamed in his honour in 2002. Scroll down for video . Sentenced: Former Arapahoe County Sheriff Patrick Sullivan, pictured last month, is serving 30 days in the prison named after him . Overhauled: After former Arapahoe sheriff Patrick Sullivan Jr was caught in a meth-for-sex sting, he was placed in the prison bearing his name; a commission voted unanimously to change it . What's in a name? The jail was named after Sullivan in 2002 . He plead guilty to felony possession of methamphetamine and the misdemeanour of soliciting prostitution earlier last week. Stunning police surveillance video . shows the moment the former sheriff of the year is swarmed by police and . arrested in a sting operation. In . the video, Sullivan is seen entering the room of one confidential . informant, who made a deal to have sex with him in exchange for meth. The informant said Sullivan had done . this ‘time and time again’ – but once the crimes were committed to . video, the arrest was made. The . 69-year-old former sheriff was sentenced to 30 days in jail, with two . years’ probation. He was also fined $1,100. However, the rest of his . charges were dropped in the plea deal. The video was released only two days after he pleaded guilty. It begins with undercover officers doing a check on the equipment and explaining that they’re waiting for Sullivan. Around . the five-minute mark, Sullivan enters the bedroom and asks the . informant to try on a pair of underwear, saying: ‘See if these might fit . you.’ As the informant is . seen looking at the underwear, Sullivan says: ‘The problem with that one . is, it doesn’t have any real elastic. Maybe too big for you. Try it as . we mess around.’ Nobody move: Sullivan, 69, did not resist arrest, but asked that officers be wary of his bad leg . The sting: Sullivan can be seen handing the informant black underwear and a shirt . He then takes out a laptop and lounges on the bed, watching a gay porno on his computer. Shame: He once served on a methamphetamine task force . At one point in the video, the informant asks if Sullivan tried any of the meth he’s giving to him, to which Sullivan responds: ‘No, it’s a social issue, why smoke it yourself?’ Minutes later, several police burst into the bedroom, detonating a flash-bang grenade. Sullivan does not resist arrest, but does ask that the police be mindful of his ‘bad leg’ – and ask them not to break it. According to 7News, the video was shot November 29. Deputy Attorney General Michael Dougherty, who investigated the former sheriff, said the law enforcement officer’s actions ‘disgraces the badge.’ Mr Dougherty told the court that Sullivan used the power associated with his position to garner the trust of gay meth users in the area. He said: ‘(Sullivan) became a manipulator, someone who used his position.’ Sullivan served as the county sheriff from 1984 until he retired in 2002, and took part in the Colorado-wide methamphetamine task force in 2000. After retiring, he became director of safety and security for Cherry Creek Schools before stepping down in 2008. Day in court: Patrick Sullivan, left, seen in court on November 30 of last year . The law won: The former sheriff of the year as seen in court last November, on the other side of the law . The good ol' days: Sullivan retired in 2002 but remained active in the community . According to The Denver Post, there were no public hints to show that Sullivan began using meth. However, the shamed former sheriff promises to make amends. He said: ‘I plan to seek forgiveness from those that I have harmed.’ Reading from a statement before his sentence, he said: ‘I apologise to this court, this country, and my family. There is no excuse for my behaviour.’ Watch video here: .","Former Arapahoe County Sheriff Patrick Sullivan, Jr sentenced to 30 days for meth possession and soliciting prostitution .

Bereft: Devastated husband John Wonfor said his wife Carol could still be alive if her suspicions had been acted on . A widower who claims medics misdiagnosed his wife’s cancer used her funeral to send a poignant message urging medical staff to listen to their patients. Devastated John Wonfor, 66, says his wife Carol repeatedly told her doctors that stomach pains they wrote off as irritable bowel syndrome and thyroid problems were actually cancer. Mrs Wonfor, 62, of Selby, North Yorkshire, was diagnosed with bowel cancer in September 2010 and operated on in October, but doctors couldn’t stop the disease from spreading and she sadly died earlier this month. Her husband, a retired glazier, has now sent a message to medical professionals at his wife’s service, using the flowers in her hearse to spell out the word ‘Listen’. The father-of-two and grandfather-of-five, who cared for his wife for 18 months before her death, said: 'I believe Carol was misdiagnosed severely. 'I don’t want to point the finger at one doctor or one nurse. I just want medical professionals to listen to their patients.' Mr Wonfor thinks that if doctors had listened to his wife, she could still be alive today. 'They could have just humoured her. It might have helped,' he said. 'The bottom line is people should listen. It doesn’t cost a bean to listen.' He explained that his wife first complained of stomach pains three years ago when they lived in Middlesex, where she visited doctors complaining of stomach pains, but was told she had a thyroid problem. But when they moved to Yorkshire two-and-a-half years ago, she visited The Beech Tree surgery to ask for investigations. The hearse carrying the coffin of Carol Wonfor stopped outside the GP's surgery to deliver the message . Mr Wonfor explained: 'My wife went to . the surgery when we moved up here and told them that she was sure there . was something more going on, and asked for a scan. 'But they told her that she didn’t qualify for one. Carol Wonfor, aged 62, died earlier this month after 18 months of chemotherapy . 'My . wife was a medical receptionist for 12 years. She felt like she had . seen people in this situation for years and now she was the one fighting . to be heard. 'She told me that she thought she might have cancer. Beech Tree said it was IBS but we know now it was cancer.' Mrs Wonfor was referred to an oncologist who realised the problem was something more sinister and sent her for a a scan. She was told she had bowel cancer and was started on a course of chemotherapy. Mr Wonfor said: 'Once Carol started receiving treatment, we had no complaints. Everyone who treated her or looked after her couldn’t have done more.' But after 18 months of chemotherapy, doctors told the couple there was nothing more they could do, as the cancer had spread to her liver and lungs. She eventually died of liver failure. Grieving friends and relatives remembered her at Brayton St Wilfred’s Church in Selby, where the hearse carrying her coffin and flowers spelling the word ‘Listen’ were driven to the Beech Tree surgery. Mr Wonfor said his wife never enjoyed her 'Bucket List' activities before her death such as seeing the Northern Lights and the Great Wall of China. The couple also hoped to travel in a renovated camper van that now sits abandoned on the driveway. Beech Tree practice manager Richard Gregory said: 'We have no comment to make.'

Embattled Syrian president Bashar Assad today denied government involvement in the massacre of more than 100 people, nearly half of them children. He claimed his forces had nothing to do with the slaughter in Syria's central Houla region and claimed not even 'monsters' would carry out such an ugly crime. The shootings, many at close range, triggered international outrage and the expulsion of Syrian diplomats from world capitals. Speaking to parliament in a televised . address in Damascus, he warned the country was facing a 'real war' and once again . blamed terrorists for the crisis. The president said Syria was passing through its most critical stage since the end of colonialism. His message came after clashes broke out between . pro and anti-Syrian groups in northern Lebanon. At least eight . people were killed between Friday night and Saturday morning, Lebanese security . officials said. The fighting in Lebanon pits Sunni . Muslims who support Syrian rebels trying to oust Assad . against members of the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam of . which Assad is a member. Smoke billowed from several apartments . near the city's Syria street, the dividing line between the mainly . Sunni Bab Tabbaneh neighborhood and the adjacent, Alawite-majority Jabal . Mohsen. Audience: Syrians watch Assad deliver his speech to Parliament as he denies government involvement in the massacre . Protest: An image released by opposition leaders of a demonstration against Assad in the northeastern city of Deir al-Zor . The area around Syria street was mostly empty except for gunmen . roaming the streets. 'We are being targeted because we . support the Syrian people,' one Sunni gunman said. 'We are with you . (Syrian people) and will not abandon you.' The opposition and the government have . exchanged accusations over the massacre with U.N. investigators claiming there were strong suspicions that pro-regime . gunmen were responsible for at least some of the killings. It was a rare public appearance by . Assad since his crackdown on the 15-month uprising which is estimated by . the U.N. to have costs the lives of 13,000 people. Victim: A grieving Syrian woman touches the face of a relative who was allegedly killed by Syrian forces in Daraa . With the country spiralling to civil war, a six-point ceasefire plan brokered by international envoy Kofi . Annan is violated by both sides every day despite 300-strong U.N. observers on the ground in Syria. Meanwhile, Washington has reached out to Syria's most important ally and protector, urging Russia to join a coordinated effort to resolve the deadly conflict. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton discussed the situation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in a telephone call yesterday, a senior State Department official said. 'They both agreed that we have to work together,' said an official. 'Her message to him was that we have to start working together to help Syrians with a serious political transition strategy.'","Despot claims 'not even 'monsters' would carry out the crime .

"By . Tom Gardner . PUBLISHED: . 08:21 EST, 19 April 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:44 EST, 19 April 2012 . The astonishing power enjoyed by the Chinese politician's wife in the frame for murdering British expat Neil Heywood emerged today. Gu Kailai, the prime suspect in the murky case which has seen Prime Minister David Cameron demand answers, is said to have terrified those around her and behaved like 'an empress'. Her husband Bo Xilai, 60, rose up the ranks of the Communist Party with an incredibly successful anti-corruption, sweeping gangs from the streets and reducing levels of crime. But his wife, 50, was an equally strong figure as details of a confrontation at the Nanshan Lijing Holiday Hotel - where Heywood, 41, was poisoned last November - would appear to confirm. Gu, furious when a waiter's pleas to noisy diners to quieten down went unheeded, called the local police chief, Wang Lijun, a close ally of her husband, and summoned him into action. A source close to Chongqing officials explained how, minutes later, he stormed into the restaurant at the hilltop hotel, brandishing his pistol and threatening the rowdy eaters. Suspicions: Police believe Gu Kailai, left, had businessman Neil Heywood, right, poisoned after he threatened to expose her plan to move millions of dollars abroad . Officers have now begun analysing . hours of CCTV footage taken from the hotel - said to be a favoured . location for Gu to hold secret business meetings - for clues. The new revelations come amid claims Gu is suffering from bone cancer and has only a short time to live, according to the Hong Kong Standard. Sources claim her terminal diagnosis . provoked a transformation of her personality leading to her be accused . of ‘promiscuity’ and flirting around. This is the latest claim to call into question her character. A close friend to Heywood said he . privately confessed that Gu Kailai was ‘mentally unstable’ and behaved . like an unforgiving ‘empress’. In conversations three years before his death, Heywood admitted that her behaviour had grown increasingly erratic. Private: Mr Heywood's body was found at the three-star resort - the same hotel where Mr Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, the prime suspect in his murder is said to have shown her power by getting the local police chief to subdue rowdy diners . Torn apart: Gu Kailai with her husband and former Chongqinq leader bo Xilai with their son Bo Guagua . He told one friend that she was . comporting herself ‘like an old-fashioned Chinese aristocrat or . empress,’ according to the Guardian. She is one of the 39 people have now been arrested in a series of raids over several months on officials linked to . politician Bo – once tipped as a future Communist Party leader. Those arrested are believed to include billionaire Xu Ming, one of China’s richest men. Police believe he was poisoned after he threatened to expose a plan by Gu to move millions of dollars abroad. Of the various unproven claims to have emerged in the case, it has been suggested that Heywood was helping to launder that money - and even that he was having an affair with Gu. Gu and Wang are in custody and Bo has not been seen in public since March, when he was dismissed as boss of Chongqing. Even by the standards of Chinese police, Wang was known as an aggressive officer. He built his reputation in the northeast province of Liaoning, where Bo was governor in the early 2000s. Wang, 52, is an ethnic Mongolian. His father was a railway worker and his mother a textile worker. He boxed as a teen, served in the People's Liberation Army for three years and worked as a forestry official before becoming a policeman in 1984. His crime crackdown in the northeast town of Tieling won him national acclaim. Zhou Lijun, a screenwriter, spent 10 days with Wang in Tieling in 1996 while working on a screenplay for a TV series about his exploits called ‘Iron Blooded Police Spirits’. Questions remain: It is thought that Mr Heywood was killed in one of the mountain-top hotel's £600-a-night villas, but details of his demise are sketchy . According to Zhou's account in a . Chinese newspaper, Wang had a flair for the dramatic. He would drive to . crime scenes in a Mitsubishi jeep modified to carry a double rack of . lights on its roof so the locals would know ‘Chief Wang’ was on the . case. He would leap atop the car, draw his . gun and fire shots in the air after arriving on the scene. On a night . raid of hair salons thought to be fronts for prostitution, Wang rushed . into one and threw a young man with dyed yellow hair to the ground. After a police search for evidence . yielded nothing, he told them to take the youth to the police station, . saying, ‘A man with hair like that can't be any good.’ Bo brought in Wang to lead a crackdown . on organised crime in Chongqing after he became the city's Communist . Party chief in 2007. The two men became close, said a source in . Chongqing with access to city officials. ‘The anti-organised crime campaign was . like a two-man skit,’ said the source. ‘But then they made the . anti-crime campaign so complicated and turned it into a campaign, a . movement, that was politicised and expanded, and then there were so many . erroneous cases and cases of torture,’ the source said. Suspicious: The reception area of the Nanshan Lijing Holiday Hotel in Chongqing, China, where British businessman Neil Heywood was found dead, apparently poisoned after threatening to expose the corrupt dealings of the wife of Communist Party chief Bo Xilai . Since the downfall of Bo and Wang, . several people who were targets of that campaign have come forward with . stories of intimidation, torture and forced confession. Tales of yet more eccentricities emerged. Wang would turn up at police stations . deep in the night to catch officers sleeping, bawl them out and then . storm out, said a Chinese businessman who met Wang several times at city . functions. He also demanded continuous supplies of fresh flowers and . towels, said another source with access to city officials. A former colleague of Wang's in . northeast China said he would sometimes perform the autopsies on . executed convicts himself because he claimed he wanted to see if ‘their . hearts were black or red’. As Wang's crime crackdown grew, the campaign created enemies in the rank and file, as well as in leadership circles. Wang's dragnet led to the city's . former justice chief and deputy police chief, Wen Qiang, being executed . in 2010 for protecting gangs, accepting bribes, rape and property scams. Wang also jailed dozens of policemen and defence lawyers in the name of . cracking down on organised crime. State media said he wore a bullet-proof vest after gangs put out a hit order on him. More threatening was scrutiny from on . high. Central government anti-graft investigators in 2011 began looking . into accusations he accepted bribes from and promoted a subordinate when . he was police chief of Tieling from 2000 to 2003, several sources said. Wang became anxious and sought help. According to accounts previously . reported by Reuters, Wang feared that Bo, keen to preserve his chances . for promotion, would abandon him after authorities began probing Wang's . past. Wang was extensively involved in . bugging and surveillance using sophisticated equipment acquired as part . of Chongqing's campaign against organised crime, and also used those . capabilities to monitor Bo and those around him, said a source in . Beijing with close ties to officials. The official allegations against . Bo, Gu and Wang have not mentioned any bugging . accusations. Late last year, problems with the . Heywood case surfaced. Wang learnt that some of his officers were . refusing to sign off on the police report, which said he had died of . natural causes.","Gu Kailai summoned the police chief who brandished gun to subdue rowdy restaurant diners .

Women may soon be able to forgo the menopause after scientists hailed a major breakthrough in the success of transplanted ovaries. It comes after the cases of three ladies who all conceived naturally and gave birth to seven babies after receiving ovary transplants. Medical experts believe the technology could be as significant as the pill was in giving woman the choice about when to have children. 'Amazing': Stinne Holm Bergholdt, who was left infertile after suffering cancer, has pioneered a groundbreaking ovarian transplant treatment, which enabled her to give birth to three babies and could be used to stop the menopause . One of the women had her tissue frozen and inserted back into her at a later date, while the other two received ovaries extracted from an identical twin to prevent rejection. The results showed that transplanted ovaries could remain effective for at least seven years and raise the possibility of being able to stop the menopause and allow women to delay motherhood. Stinne Holm Bergholt, 35, went on to give birth to three babies after chemotherapy for bone cancer left her infertile. Ending the end of motherhood: Dr Sherman Silber, director of the Infertility Center of St Louis, Missouri, has hailed the breakthrough . Before the chemotherapy, however, she had one of her ovaries taken out and transplanted back in afterwards. Holm Bergholt, a Danish doctor, told The Sunday Times: 'Seven years back, I had just finished chemotherapy and my body was very weak. 'Now I have three children and I am living a normal life. It's amazing.' Sherman Silber, one of the lead scientists and a member of the Infertility Centre of St Louis, Missouri, said: 'It is possible to remove a small piece of ovarian tissue, freeze it, and when the woman reaches menopause around the age of 51, we could transplant that tissue back and she might not ever have to go through menopause.' The findings, to be published in the medical journal Reproductive Biomedicine Online, have led to plans to offer British women the option of freezing parts of their ovaries in the twenties. Gedis Grudzinskas, a consultant gynaecologist in London, said: 'Women will have so much choice about when and how to have children, independent of their age and the so-called biological clocks ticking away at various rates in their ovaries.'","Transplanted ovaries effective for at least seven years .

Heart-wrenching: Jason Lees, who taught at the exclusive Anglican Church Grammar School, rode his bike to Brisbane's 243ft-high Story Bridge at 2.30am on Monday morning . And they said they thought his decision to kill his own son and then take his own life was because his psychologist wife Danielle Sutton no longer lived with him. Lees, who taught at the exclusive Anglican Church Grammar School, rode his bike to Brisbane's 243ft-high Story Bridge at 2.30am on Monday morning. He threw his toddler over the edge, before jumping himself - they both landed in parkland on the banks of the Brisbane River. Marlene Stephens, who lives next door, told the Herald Sun: 'She left him a while back and you could hear and see him crying on the back stairs. Sad: Police remove the bicycle which Jason Lees is believed to have used to reach Brisbane's Story Bridge . Cordon: A witness helps police with their investigations after Jason Lees committed 'murder-suicide' 'I remember the little boy came down and wrapped his arms around him - I'm always going to remember that image. It was always so lovely to hear them laugh. He was a beautiful kid.' Mr Lees met his future wife, who is currently being comforted by family on the Gold Coast, after he moved from Canada about 15 years ago. His brother Bill said he met his baby nephew when his brother and family visited Canada in 2010 so Jason could referee an international rugby sevens match. He said: 'That was the last time I saw them. I'm shocked... Nobody in my family I know saw this coming. There is more to this story.' Former colleagues and students have also paid tribute to the teacher. Talented: Jason Lees was an International Seven's Rugby Union referee . Horrific: Jason Lees, left, threw his two-year . son Brad, right, off the Story Bridge in Brisbane in the early hours of Monday . morning before jumping to his own death . Greg Wain, headmaster of The Southport School where Mr Lees worked until four years ago, said he was saddened by the tragedy. He told the Telegraph: 'Jason left us four years ago and he is remembered fondly as a well-respected teacher and wonderfully caring man.' And Anglican Church Grammar School headmaster Jonathan Hensman described the former teacher as 'enthusiastic, passionate and an honour to the profession'. 'The impact this sudden news has had on our community is significant and as we work through our grief we are concerned for our boys whom he taught in the classroom or coached on the sports field,' he told the Port Stephens Examiner. Tragedy: Brisbane's Story Bridge from which Jason Lees threw his child before jumping himself . The tragedy is similar to an incident in 2009 when 37-year-old Arthur Freeman tossed his four-year-old daughter Darcey from Melbourne's Westgate Bridge - although he did not jump but gave himself up and was subsequently jailed for life. A witness who saw the incident, at around 3.30am, called police who rushed to the scene but there was nothing they could do for Mr Lees or the child. Police said they did not believe the child was the subject of a custody battle, unlike the child in the Melbourne tragedy. Brisbane's Courier Mail newspaper said uniformed police and detectives had set up a screen around the bodies before they were taken away. Forensic scientists began dusting the bridge rails for fingerprints. The police activity caused delays in early morning traffic.","Jason Lees committed 'murder-suicide' from Brisbane's Story Bridge .

A drunk property developer who was 'cheered on' as he swam across the Thames died after he slipped under the water and drowned. Bystanders who 'egged on' Laurence Newman watched as he got three quarters of the way across the river before he slowed down, 'panicked' and disappeared under the water for five minutes. The 45-year-old, who was described as a 'strong swimmer' had been drinking all day in hot weather with his estranged wife on July 30 last year when he decided to swim from one side of the river to the other in Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey. Tragedy: Laurence Newman stripped off and jumped in the Thames near Kingston Bridge (pictured) but slipped under the surface three-quarters of the way across, a coroner heard today . He decided to make the journey from the Kingston side of the river to the Hampton Wick side. Jumping in near the Gazebo pub by Kingston Bridge at around 7.50pm, he was cheered by members of the public on the busy riverside and made it three-quarters of the way across before he got into trouble, West London Coroners Court heard. A huge rescue effort was launched but, despite attempts to resuscitate him, but Mr Newman, from Surbiton, died in hospital in the early hours of the following morning. The court heard he had 269mg of alcohol per 100mls in his system - more than three times the drink drive limit. Inspector Caroline Newman, of Kingston Police, told the court that a passer-by, Phillip Green, was walking along the footpath and saw a figure dressed in a black t-shirt and black shorts attempting to swim to the other side. She said: 'He saw that the swimmer was making a steady passage across the river, but after a time things seemed to slow and when Mr Newman had reached about three-quarters across he appeared to drop forward into the water. 'He re-appeared shortly after and disappeared again. Mr Green realised he was in difficulty. He took off his clothing and swam across the river to help. He swam to the point when he last saw him disappear from view. He couldn’t see him as the water was murky.' Boaters, including a student nurse, also jumped into the water to help and they managed to bring him to the river bank. Coroner Alison Thompson said it was clear he had been submerged for more than five minutes. The court heard a police officer spoke to his wife Gill who was distressed and appeared to be drunk, with slurred speech and red eyes. She said they had been drinking most of the day and 'Laurence had decided to go into the river and before she realised what he was doing he had taken off his clothes and was in the water. He was egged on by watchers who urged him to get to the other side'. Despite the weather, the water was cold, Inspector Newman said, adding: 'It is also the current and the depth and speed. As it approaches the bridge the flow and suction of the water is very strong.' His mother, Pamela Newman, raised concerns about the amount of signs on the river bank warning people against jumping into the water. She said: 'It is clear that it is a dangerous thing to jump into very cold water during very hot weather and people forget this. I think it is very important to show the dangerous nature of the water'. She added that her son 'loved to swim'. Inspector Newman said the police had a ‘River Watch’ scheme which worked to promote safety on the river bank, and that there were now silver railings near to the pub which were put in place after another 'life was lost'. Recording a verdict of misadventure and a cause of death as immersion, Ms Thompson said: 'Whilst a strong swimmer, he succumbed to the combination of alcohol, the water temperature and the strong current.' She also hailed Mr Green a 'hero' and said she would also be contacting River Watch to 'reinforce the situation'.","'Strong swimmer' Laurence Newman had been drinking all day when he decided to swim across the river .

Children fled in terror as armed police opened fired on a gang of robbery suspects and killed a convicted criminal whose drugs trial collapsed after a juror contacted a defendant on Facebook. Youngsters in a playground ran for cover while teenagers cowered in a pizza takeaway shop as police gunned down Anthony Grainger in Culcheth, Cheshire. The 35-year-old father was shot in the chest by officers who wore protective masks and let off CS gas as they moved in on a red . Audi hatchback on Saturday night. The fatal shot was fired through the windscreen and local reports suggested that the killer round may have penetrated his heart. A police source said officers had been tracking the car for some time in the belief that those inside were about to carry out a robbery. When the occupants were seen allegedly putting on balaclavas, armed officers surrounded the car and ordered the three men inside to put their hands up. It is believed Grainger did not do so. Moments later, officers opened fire. Two other men were held after the swoop, which Greater Manchester Police said was a 'pre-planned operation' following a tip-off. They refused to say whether Grainger, from Bolton, was armed and it is not known if any weapons were recovered from the car. He is the first person to be killed by police marksmen since the death of Mark Duggan in Tottenham, north London, which sparked the riots last summer. Saturday's . incident, which came two weeks after a machete-wielding gang robbed a . Co-Op store, is now under investigation by the the Independent Police . Complaints Commission (IPCC). Witnesses described how terror spread across the village as officers from the Specialist Operations branch swooped on the village, which is 15 miles west on Manchester. Jessica . Brown, 15, said she was with friends in the Village Pizza takeaway when . a couple came in and warned them to 'stand back against . the wall'. Father: Grainger with a child, thought to be his, and his girlfriend Gail Hadfield, who today criticised police . Big spender: Grainger behind the wheel of a high-powered Mercedes . 'I later looked out of the window and . saw three people in black clothing with gas masks on and saw other . people chasing them,' she said. 'When we came outside there was gas in the air, you could smell it. 'I then saw a black van with three or . four people inside drive towards the car park. One of them was leaning . outside the window and I later heard shots. 'It all looked like something off a film. It did not feel real at all. It was horrible.' Her father Anthony described his fear over 'mad men running around with guns shooting'. He . said his first thought was to get children inside and added: 'You don't . want the kids outside when there's mad men running round with guns . shooting.' Jessica said a large number of her friends . were also congregated in a playground in Common Lane and many ran for . cover towards the shopping precinct as the scene unfolded. Grainger’s girlfriend Gail Hadfield, . 29, today condemned the ‘dirty b****** police who should never have . fired on a man sat in a car in the corner of a car park’. Shot: A bullet hole in the windscreen of a red Audi that police opened fire at in Culcheth, Cheshire during a swoop on the village that left suspected robber Anthony Grainger dead from a single wound to the chest . Death scene: A forensic tent covers surrounds the two cars - red and grey Audis - used during the incident . In a defiant misspelled message, she . said: ‘You cant help who you fall in love with and they have been the . best days of my life, not one regret, he is the most perfect caring man i . have ever known. ‘God only takes the good ones. ‘He will be my everything forever, . until the day we can be 2gva again, i send my love to your poor . children, who have also lost, and your family. ‘I know you are up there waiting for me babe x and i can only count the days till we are back together.... I LOVE YOU X X X X.’ In 2010 Grainger, had been accused . of being linked to a plot to corrupt a drugs squad officer into selling . secret information in return for a £20,000 BMW and other bribes. Witness: Jessica Brown said she 'looked out of the window and saw three people in black clothing with gas masks on and saw other people chasing them' But the trial collapsed – at a cost of . £6million – after it emerged that juror Joanne Fraill had discussed the . case on Facebook with one of his co-defendants, Jamie Sewart. Fraill, . 40, was jailed for eight months. A fresh jury failed to reach a verdict . on drugs charges against Grainger, but he was jailed for 20 months for . handling stolen goods. Mr Grainger's brother Stuart was jailed in 2001 for the murder of Derek Ianson. He was gunned down at his home in Salford. A spokesman for IPCC said Mr Grainger died of a single . gunshot wound to the chest. He added: 'An inquest will be formally opened this afternoon at Warrington Coroners Court. 'IPCC investigators are continuing with their investigation into the death and have been present at the scene since last night. 'The independent investigation will . consider the actions of all the officers at the scene, as well as the . planning, decision making and implementation of the operation which led . to the death.' It is understood the operation was . part of an investigation led by Greater Manchester Police into a planned . robbery in the vicinity and did not involve other forces or the North . West Regional Organised Crime Unit (Titan) which tackles serious and . organised crime gangs. His body was taken away from the . scene yesterday by private ambulance.

'It's almost as if there was an anticipation of something going to happen last night,' one person wrote. There was also speculation that the shooting may have arisen from an attempted robbery of a village shop. The Co-op store was the scene of a recent robbery in which a machete was used. Three men entered the Co-op on February 18 at 9.05pm with one of them carrying the weapon covered by a bag.

"By . Peter Allen . PUBLISHED: . 09:55 EST, 4 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:31 EST, 4 July 2012 . Nicolas Sarkozy knew police would come ‘looking’ for him, close friends of the ex-president have claimed. As the former French leader and his wife Carla Bruni sought refuge in the home of a Canadian billionaire, it has emerged that the pair fled just hours before his Paris home and office was raided by anti-corruption police. Although the former president has made no public comment, friends of his were quoted in Le Parisien newspaper as saying: “I know they’ll come looking for me. Nothing will come of it all.” The couple pictured after meeting Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, only a few days before they took off to Canada . Mr Sarkozy is currently seeking refuge in the Montreal home of 86-year-old Canadian businessman Paul Desmarais. That is sure to raise eyebrows in France as well because Sarkozy awarded the Legion of Honour, France’s highest civilian award, in 2008. His Paris residence was raided amid allegations that the ex-President accepted thousands of pounds in cash from France’s richest woman. Liliane Bettencourt, the L’Oreal cosmetics heiress, is said to have provided the money in brown envelopes to fund Sarkozy’s political career in return for future tax breaks. Sarkozy’s immunity from prosecution ended last month after he lost his re-election bid, and on Tuesday detectives launched dawn swoops on three addresses connected with him. Heiress: Liliane Bettencourt is the richest woman in Europe. She inherited cosmetics company L'Oreal when her father Eugene Shueller died in 1957 . The night before, Sarkozy and his third wife left their Paris mansion with their baby daughter, Giulia, and flew to Montreal. Officially, Sarkozy would not have been given any warning of the police raids. Commentators are also pointing to the fact that the Sarkozy family only recently returned from a month-long break in Morocco, making claims of a ‘holiday’ in Canada highly suspicious. Paul Desmarais, right,  has been described by Sarkozy, left, as his 'mentor' and he has even credited the 86-year-old business magnate with his presidency . Instead, it appears that Sarkozy has once again relied on his fabulously wealthy contacts to help him during a personal and professional crisis. Desmarais, the CEO of the media and financial services giant Power Corporation of Canada,  is said to be worth well over £20billion. Sarkozy has frequently described Desmarais as a mentor, saying in 2008: ‘If I am president today, it is in part due to Paul Desmarais.’ In February 2008, Sarkozy returned the favour by giving Desmarais the grand-croix (great-cross) of the Legion of Honour. One of Desmarais’s daughters, Sophie, was married to Eric Le Moyne de Serigny, a former closer advisor to Sarkozy who has also been implicated in the so-called Bettencourt Affair. During his presidency, Sarkozy was frequently accused of solely being interested in the super-rich. He infamously celebrated his presidential victory in 2007 with a number of multi-billionaire friends in Fouquet’s, an upmarket Paris restaurant. Desmarais was on the guest list. Judge Jean-Michel Gentil believes that Mrs Bettencourt may have illegally contributed two separate payments of £335,000 to Mr Sarkozy’s 2007 election campaign. Both were traced to Swiss accounts, and one was allegedly received by Sarkozy in person in Paris. Sarkozy is also facing allegations that he profited from illegal arms sales to Pakistan, and that he accepted millions from former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Sarkozy denies all the charges, with his lawyer Thierry Herzog saying the searches of his home and two lawyers offices linked to him would ‘find nothing’. Mr Herzog claimed that the Sarkozy family was merely ‘on holiday’ in Canada, and would return to France in around two weeks.","Sarkozy and wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy travelled to Canada seeking refuge with a Canadian billionaire Paul Desmarais .

Sebastian Bowles, 12, had told his family that he was having a ‘really great’ holiday and could ‘already ski quite well’. Just two days later he was one of 22 children from a Belgian school killed when their coach crashed as they returned home. The two drivers and four teachers on board were also killed. Swiss investigators yesterday said they believed the coach had clipped a kerb before veering into a lay-by which led to a solid brick wall.

They are however examining whether the angle of the tunnel wall contributed to the severity of the crash on Wednesday. Sebastian had moved with his family to Belgium two years ago so they could be closer to the relatives of his mother Ann. He . had been a popular pupil at Our Lady of Muswell Catholic Primary in .

With the joy of a child enjoying his . first taste of freedom, Sebastian tells his parents and his sister . Helena about his adventures ski-ing and eating a barbecue on the slopes. He had written: ‘Dearest Mama, Papa, Helena and Flopsy. I can already ski quite well. It’s really great here.’ The schoolboy adds: ‘After breakfast we had a lovely walk and the teacher told us a story about the area. ‘Then we went ski-ing and ate a . barbecue on the slopes.

They . had returned to Belgium yesterday but the shutters were down at their . detached house on the outskirts of Leuven, near  Brussels. A neighbour . said: ‘He was such a fantastic, polite boy. 'He always said hello. It’s . such a  shocking thing.’ Both Sebastian and his sister  attended St Lambertus School in Heverlee, two miles from their home, where Belgian flags were draped from windows in the neighbourhood as a mark of respect.

'Astonishing' reading: Laura Knowles (above) was five time the drink-drive limit when caught taking her two young daughters homes from the pub . A mother was caught driving her two young daughters while five times the legal alcohol limit after a marathon drinking session. Laura Knowles, who has five children, had been boozing all day in the pub before driving away in her silver Ford Puma. Police were tipped off and watched as Knowles drove out of the car park at 7.25pm with her daughters, aged four and five, inside. Manchester magistrates heard how she drove down the middle of the road without her lights on. When she was stopped yards from her home, she gave a reading of 187 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. The limit is 35mcg. The court heard the officer who stopped her had never seen such a high reading during 20 years in the force. Knowles, 29, of Darwell Avenue, Eccles, Salford, admitted driving with excess alcohol and being drunk in charge of children under seven. She was given a three-month suspended jail sentence and banned from the road for three years. She was also ordered to pay £85 court costs. District Judge Paul Richardson told her: 'You have lived a blemishless life and then you behave like this, and to make it worse, kids were in the car. 'I don't think I have come across a higher reading. There is nothing I can do, but to pass a custodial sentence - but I will suspend it.' Prosecutor Tina Cunnane said: 'The officer was astonished by the reading because she was so lucid and he had never seen one so high in 20 years in the job.' During a previous hearing, it was said that at one stage Knowles had four of her children with her in the Dutton Arms in Eccles, on Easter Sunday. Melanie Winstanley, mitigating, said she was devastated at what she had done and realised her stupidity. She had intended to walk home to check on her other children, but foolishly got into the car. Regret: Knowles says she had intended to walk home after a drinking session in the Dutton Arms (pictured) in Eccles, but foolishly got into the car instead . Miss Winstanley said: 'This was an isolated incident and she is completely devastated. 'She was fully co-operative with the police and honestly believed that she was alright to drive.' At the first hearing, the judge had said: 'With the amount of alcohol in your system, you were a grave danger to yourself and the children and the general public.' The court heard that a social services report showed Knowles had good parenting skills and the children were doing well at school. Miss Winstanley added: 'She seldom drinks, but when she does it is on a binge basis.' Knowles, who has never been in trouble before, said : 'I am sorry I have done it. I am just glad it is over.'","Mum-of-five Laura Knowles, 29, drove down middle of road with no lights on .

The tent was attached to a sports bar where hundreds of people were celebrating the St Louis Cardinals' victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. Scroll down for video . Disaster: One person was dead and 100 injured after a tent collapsed by a sports bar near the Busch stadium in St Louis this afternoon . Injury: Rescue workers take one of the storm victims to hospital after the tent collapse . Aftermath: An official surveys the scene after the accident, which involved 100 celebrating baseball fans . The St Louis Post-Dispatch reports it was not clear if the man who died was struck during the storm or went into cardiac arrest because of the shock. The tent was set up next to Kilroy's . Sports Bar, where St Louis Fire Chief Dennis Jenkerson said a few . hundred people were celebrating the baseball team's win. Kilroy's owner Art Randall said he . thought a train fell off the track when wind gusts picked up the tent . and debris flew across the area. 'We all ducked for cover,' he said. 'Everything was going sideways. I had metal chairs ripping across the beer garden.' Injuries: A woman in a neck brace is treated at the scene after the tent collapsed at Kilroy's Sports Bar . Hazard: Kilroy's bar owner Art Randall said things . were flying through the air sideways and metal chairs were being flung . across the beer garden by the storm . Devestating: Emergency officials said 17 people were taken to hospitals with injuries ranging from minor to very serious . Witnesses said the storm lasted several seconds and estimated the winds were between 60 to 80 mph. After its collapse, patrons were struck with metal poles and electrical wires. Emergency officials said 17 people were taken to hospitals with injuries ranging from minor to very serious, including the man who died. Janece Friederich was in the parking lot at Kilroy's when she saw dark clouds approaching. Before she could get out of the car and go into the bar, she saw the tent fly into the air. 'It looked like it just got ripped out because it ended up 100 feet in the air on top of the railroad tracks,' Ms Friederich said. Mr Randall suggested that the victim had died after being struck by lightning, and said that other patrons had tried to administer CPR but were unsuccessful. 'At some point in that five seconds, we were . getting lightning strikes, and apparently one of our customers got hit . by lightning right in the middle of the dance floor,' he said. Blown away: The tent was left resting against a nearby train trestle . Temporary: The tent had been set up to accommodate fans wanting to celebrate after the Cardinals game . Celebration: But the happy afternoon took a tragic turn thanks to the intervention of high winds . KSDK reported that fire officials said five people were in critical condition and 100 people were treated at the scene. St Louis Fire Chief Dennis Jenkerson blamed the incident on the flimsy construction of the tent. 'We don’t like this type of building, if you will,' he said. 'This gives us nightmares. And as you can see, it caused one.' Several bars and restaurants in the area around Busch Stadium set up tents throughout the baseball season to handle overflow crowds - Cardinals games are typically sellouts, or close to it. In addition to the baseball game, about 20,000 fans were downtown Saturday for a St Louis Blues hockey playoff game. 'Nightmare': Local fire chief Dennis Jenkerson described the destruction . Building Commissioner Frank Oswald said Kilroy's was granted a tent permit on April 11 and it passed inspection a couple of days later. Mr Oswald said the city requires tents to be able to withstand winds up to 90 mph, but he declined to speculate on whether Kilroy's could face discipline. He cautioned that patrons need to understand that a tent is not a safe place to be in bad weather. St Louis had been under thunderstorm watches and warnings for some time prior to the incident at Kilroy's. 'Tents are temporary structures,' Mr Oswald said. 'They are certainly not designed in any stretch of the imagination to handle weather like this.' About two hours after the incident at Kilroy's, tornado sirens blared throughout the city after a funnel cloud sighting. There were several reports of tree damage, power lines down and damage from hail that in some parts of the region reportedly was as big as tennis balls. By late evening, about 2,600 Ameren UE electrical customers were without power in the city. Watch video here .","High winds knocked down structure at bar near Busch Stadium in St Louis .

Former Democratic presidential contender John Edwards was today described as a 'master manipulator' at the start of a trial that could see him handed a lengthy prison sentence. Prosecutors are trying to prove that the ex-Senator knew that $1m in donations to his 2008 presidential campaign was intended to prevent his family finding out about his mistress. He faces six charges including conspiring to solicit funds and taking illegal campaign contributions- each of which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. But his defence argues that the donations handled by his staffer Andrew Young were gifts from friends who wanted to hide the affair. They claim most of most of the money was siphoned of by Mr Young's to renovate his home. Mr Young has struck a plea deal with prosecutors and is due to take the stand against his former boss. 'Master manipulator': John Edwards arrives outside federal court with his daughter Cate in Greensboro . Possible defence witness: Rielle Hunter, the former mistress of John Edwards, enters the federal courthouse in Raleigh, North Carolina, Thursday, August 6, 2009 with the pair's child Frances Quinn Hunter . But the defence today tried to undermine him by revealing that he had a one night stand with another witness in 2007. U.S District Court Judge Catherine C. Eagles said that former Edwards aide Andrew Young slept with a young . campaign employee and also contacted three other witnesses in the past . two weeks to consult with them about their planned testimony. Calling . into question the credibility of the key prosecution witness, Young had . agreed to testify against his former boss in the hope that he will . avoid prosecution himself in the fallout from the trial of almost $1 . million of misappropriated campaign funds by Edwards. The judge ruled that lawyers for Edwards . could mention the improper contact to . jurors in opening arguments Monday, but barred them from using the term . 'witness tampering' or telling the jury that Young had a one-night . stand with one of the other witnesses in 2007. The former aide is . potentially the government's most important witness as prosecutors seek to . prove the then-married Democratic candidate masterminded a scheme to use nearly . $1 million provided by two wealthy campaign donors to help hide his pregnant mistress . as he sought the White House in 2008. Young once falsely claimed paternity of . the child Edwards fathered with his then-mistress Rielle Hunter in 2007. Edwards, 58, has pleaded not guilty to . six criminal counts related to alleged violations of federal campaign finance . laws. Violation of federal law: Andrew Young pictured with his wife Cheri contacted three witnesses in the John Edwards criminal trial to ask about their possible testimony said the judge in the trial today . The former candidate sat silently in the . courtroom Monday morning as the lead federal prosecutor called him a man who . would say or do anything to get elected president, including violating the law . to hide his affair and keep his campaign viable. 'It wasn't just a marriage on the . line,' said prosecutor David Harbach. 'If the affair went public it . would destroy his chance of becoming president, and he knew it. ...He made a . choice to break the law.' The judge seated 12 jurors and four alternates Monday morning. The panel is . made up of nine men and seven women drawn from central North Carolina, the . state that elected Edwards to serve one term in the U.S. Senate. Former U.S. Sen. and presidential candidate John Edwards arrives at federal court. Prosecutors and defense lawyers will begin making their case to jurors on whether the former presidential candidate violated federal campaign finance laws . A defense lawyer for Edwards told the . jury that most of the money at issue in the case went not to support Hunter, . but was siphoned off by Young and his wife to build a $1.5 million 'dream home' near Chapel Hill. Former candidate Edwards' lawyers contend the payments were gifts from friends . intent on keeping the candidate's wife from finding out about the affair. Tragically, Elizabeth Edwards . died in December 2010 after battling cancer. A key issue will be whether Edwards knew about the payments made on his . behalf by his national campaign finance chairman, the late Texas lawyer Fred . Baron, and campaign donor Rachel ""Bunny"" Mellon, a now-101-year-old . heiress and socialite. Andrew Young, former campaign aide to former U.S. Sen. John Edwards enters the Federal Courthouse for opening day of Edwards' criminal trial on April 23, 2012 in Greensboro . Each had already given Edwards' campaign the maximum . $2,300 individual contribution allowed by federal law. Edwards denies having known about the . money, which paid for private jets, luxury hotels and Hunter's medical care. Prosecutors will seek to prove he sought and directed the payments to cover up . his affair, protect his public image as a 'family man' and keep his . presidential hopes viable. It is alleged as part of this, Young and his wife invited the pregnant . Hunter to live in their home near Chapel Hill and later embarked with her on a . cross-country odyssey as they sought to elude tabloid reporters trying to . expose the candidate's extramarital affair. Former aide Young later fell out with Edwards and . wrote an unflattering tell-all book, 'The Politician.' Former U.S. Sen. John Edwards enters the Federal Courthouse for opening day of his criminal trial. The once Democratic presidential candidate, Edwards is expected to plead not guilty to six counts of campaign finance violations . And just recently, Young and Hunter ended a two-year legal battle over ownership of a sex tape the . mistress recorded with Edwards during the campaign, agreeing to a settlement . that dictates that copies of the video will be destroyed. While Young is expected to be a witness for . the prosecution, the defense is likely to call Hunter to testify. Two of . the lawyers who represented Hunter in her civil suit against the former aide . joined Edwards' legal team last month. After years of adamant public denials, . Edwards acknowledged paternity of Hunter's daughter, Frances Quinn Hunter, in 2010. The girl, now 4, . lives with her mother in Charlotte and is visited frequently by Edwards. And despite rumours Edwards and Hunter were looking to get married, a recent sighting reported to the New York Post claims the one-time secret romance is no more.

A conman who stole nearly £250,000 from his frail deaf and blind mother-in-law to fund a luxury lifestyle, was today jailed for three years. David Stanton, 68, used money that should have been paying for Fanny Epps' nursing home bills to prop up his struggling business and buy top-of-the range cars and expensive holidays. Mrs Epps, the mother of Stanton's wife Ruth, died in March 2010 at the age of 94. Stanton, of Budleigh Salterton, Devon, admitting stealing £245,209.25p from Mrs Epps between November 2002 and February 2004. The conman, . who has oxygen tubes to help him breathe, also admitted converting . criminal property by funding the purchase of a £45,000 BMW 7 series car. Stanton got his hands on Mrs Epps money after she had a fall at home and it was decided she needed to move into a care home. He was handed control of her affairs and sold her house. But instead of using the money to pay nursing home bills, he kept it for himself. Defence lawyer Lee Bremridge argued that Stanton had actually been paying for his mother-in-law's care and that the amount stolen was £127,600 and not £245,000. But prosecutor Sean Brunton said money was still owed to the nursing home and that there will be a Proceeds of Crime investigation. Stanton's wife of 29 years revealed she has been left . destitute by his life of lies and compared . her ex-husband to Walter Mitty - a fictional ineffective character with . a vivid fantasy life in James Thurber's short story The Secret Life of . Walter Mitty. She even accused him of deliberately losing weight to back up his false claim that he was dying of cancer. Mrs Stanton said: 'I am now 68 and living in a one . bedroom flat. I am now working 12 hour shifts in a nursing home as a . care assistant to pay my rent.' 'I found out that he wasn’t paying any bills, not even on my car insurance. And of course we still owe thousands in fees for my mother’s care. My mother ended up staying in a tiny little room in a nursing home funded by social services. She died aged 94 and I don’t know if she had any idea about all this. 'I took him to court for some closure for my mother. 'He even auctioned furniture from our home where he had a safe. I ended up with just a few personal effects from my first husband who had died a long time ago. 'He is a Walter Mitty. Who knows if he has any money left, who knows if there was another woman. 'When he said he had cancer he deliberately lost weight. But then he later admitted that was not true. He is the most amazing conman.' Deceived: Fanny Epps at her 90th birthday with her daughters Sandra Locke, centre, and wife of David Stanton, Ruth, right . 'My mother had had a fall when she . lived in London. We had to sell her house to pay for her care down in . Devon. David had the Power of Attorney to sell her house. 'He said he had invested it in the money markets and that would pay for her to stay in the nursing home.' 'That’s how it went on, we all . thought he had done what he said he had done. But when I left him I . discovered there was no money. It had all gone along with our business. 'We had six mobility shops around the Westcountry and he had used some of the money to do this.

A French free-climber known as 'Spiderman' has completed his latest daredevil feat by scaling a 700ft skyscraper in front of stunned onlookers. Alain Robert climbed the 50-storey Bakrie Tower in Jakarta, Indonesia using suction cups and a safety harness, after police banned him from climbing with his bare hands. Two years ago the 49-year-old tried to scale Indonesia's Wisma Mulia Tower bare-handed, but was caught by police and deported from the country. Scroll down for video of the climb . Scaling the heights: Alain Robert continues another daredevil climb, this time up the 700ft Bakrie Tower in Jakarta, Indonesia . Now after agreeing to safety conditions the daredevil was allowed back to Indonesia to reach the top of the 215m Bakrie Tower, one of Jakarta's tallest buildings. Robert, who has made a career out of climbing the world's iconic skyscrapers with no safety support, reached the summit of the Bakrie Tower in just over two-and-a-half hours. After his climb he said: 'This is a specific demand and right away I understood that there would be no possibility for me to use only my fingers.' In the past two decades Robert has climbed more than 85 of the world's tallest buildings, including London's Canary Wharf, the Empire State Building, and the Eiffel Tower. His tallest feat saw him climb to the top of the then world's tallest building, the 508m Taipei 101 in China, in December 2004. On that occasion he wore a safety rope due to inclement weather conditions on his four-hour ascent. Head for heights: Robert, 49, was only allowed to climb the 215m tower if he agreed to use a safety harness . Tall order: The Frenchman completed his latest daring feat in around two-and-a-half hours . He has suffered several falls resulting sometimes in serious fractures, and his high-climbing antics often see him fined or arrested. In 2009 Mr Robert was fined £435 for climbing the 41-storey Royal Bank of Scotland building in Sydney. Robert also climbs buildings in order to raise awareness of climate change.

But while the Cambridgeshire village of Stilton may claim to be the home of the crumbly blue favourite, those who produce the cheese are bizarrely not allowed to use its famous name. A current European Law ruling means Stilton cheese can only be produced by seven dairies in Leicestershire, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. Tradition: Cheese makes in Stilton, Cambridgeshire, have been banned from using the name for the famous cheese produced in their village . Famous: Stilton makes the most of its association with the famous cheese, and villagers are hoping to gain official recognition from Defra soon . The 'ridiculous' decision means that while the famous blue cheese can be made in Stilton, it has to go by the name Bell Blue. Now, after last year finally winning the right to produce Stilton in their village at all, campaigners in Cambridgeshire want the right to call their product by its proper name. The . current dispute over Stilton being able to use the cheese's name in its . own village stems in part from the historic blue's history. Historical evidence suggests a cream cheese was being made and sold in and around Stilton in the late 17th century. A . recipe for Stilton cheese was published in a newsletter by Richard . Bradley in 1723, but no details were given on its size, shape, or how . long it was matured. In . 1724 Daniel Defoe commented in his 'Tour through the villages of . England & Wales' of Stilton being 'famous for cheese' and referred . to the cheese as being the 'English Parmesan'. A . later article by John Lawrence in 1726 suggested that the perfect . Stilton should be... 'about 7 inches in diameter, 8 inches in height and . 18 lbs in weight.' As Stilton became a trading post between London and Edinburgh, the cheese was said to be sold to passing traders. As demand for the cheese grew, its production moved to Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire. It . was at this stage that the cheese's trademark blue veins became a part . of the product, as it also became semi-hard blue cheese. On Monday the village of Stilton applied to Defra for an extension of the protected designation of origin (PDO) for the cheese to cover their parish. The village launched their campaign . two days ago at the start of National Stilton Week 2012, and will boost . their efforts by adding the phrase 'Original Home of Stilton Cheese' to a . sign outside their village. Stilton . cheese is said by some to have got its name after being sold to . travellers passing through the village in the 18th century. Officials . in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, however, say Stilton was only a . trade link and that the recipe was created in their county. Stilton is officially recognised as . coming from Leicestershire, and can only be produced there and in its . two neighbouring counties following the PDO in 1996. Liam McGivern, landlord of the Bell Inn in Stilton, makes a version of the cheese which until now he has had to call Bell Blue. He said that not being able to call . the cheese Stilton is 'embarrassing', especially given the tourist . appeal that comes with the product. He said: 'We get people coming in all the time saying, ""Oh, can you direct me to the cheese factory?"" 'If you asked 99 per cent of the population where the cheese comes from, they would say Stilton.' The . campaign in Stilton has been created by various people and businesses . in the village, and fronted by local historian Richard Landy. He told the Peterborough Evening . Telegraph: 'Since first being announced at last year’s Stilton Cheese . Rolling event, this campaign has continued to gather momentum. 'We . have now fulfilled Defra’s requirements that we must be making the . cheese, which we have been doing since 2011 and that it must be for . commercial sale. 'They are the conditions that need to be satisfied before applying for an amendment to the PDO.' Matthew . O'Callaghan, chairman of the Melton Mowbray Food Partnership, disputes . whether blue Stilton was ever made in the village of the same name. A . spokesperson for Defra said: 'To amend the geographical boundaries of . an existing protected food, an applicant must first prove they are an . interested party by showing they genuinely already make it commercially . on a permanent, regular basis. 'We . would then carefully consider an application and if the claim was . justified we would hold a UK-wide public consultation before making any . decision.' Association: Stilton has long enjoyed a link to the famous blue cheese, and even has an annual Stilton cheese rolling event through the village .

An island offering a secluded beach, promises of great fishing and stunning views of the San Francisco skyline is up for sale — and at a heavily discounted price. Red Rock Island, a 6-acre mass of rock tucked away in a northern part of San Francisco Bay, is now being offered for just under $5 million after being listed for $22 million earlier this year. Its owner Mack Durning is now so desperate to flog the land he has clashed the asking price by $18. Bargain: Red Rock Island is on the marked for $5milllion after the owner slashed the asking price of $22million . Mineral rights for the property, which contains manganese in its rocky outcroppings, are negotiable. The undeveloped island has been on and off the market for years and relator Steven Higbee said he advised Mr Durning that the way to sell was by 'whittling away at the price.' Dishing out a few million dollars for a 5.78-acre property — especially one with no house or other structure — is not for everyone. But Higbee notes that if and when the island is sold, the new owner will have some unique opportunities. Sitting about six miles north of San Francisco, just off the south side of the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, Red Rock Island is not just off the beaten path, it's not on any path — and doesn't even appear on some maps. Accessible only by boat or helicopter, and with no crowds of tourists swarming about, this island offers what may be the ultimate in a secluded getaway. Higbee said: 'You could go out there and have wild parties or retreat away from the wild parties,' He added that the new owner also would have the 'bragging rights' of owning their own private island in San Francisco Bay. Then there's the chance to escape San Francisco's gloomy and damp summer days with a quick trip to his or her island retreat, with a relaxing day of basking in the sun. 'Red Rock Island is out of fog bank,' Higbee said. 'If San Francisco is in the fog, you may be sitting in the sunshine.' If you want to get out of the sunshine, be sure to bring your own umbrella. There are no structures on the island. All that stands is a flagpole and its supporting wires. Tempted? The island has no structures in place but could be a good fishing spot for keen anglers . Over the years, ideas have been floated to remove dirt and rock from part of the island and sell it for use in roadway construction, and to build a hotel on the remaining land, though none of those ideas have been implemented. The only person to ever call Red Rock Island 'home' for any period was a man named Selim Woodworth who built a cabin on the island and lived there from 1851 to 1856. Possible loneliness aside, Higbee points out that the new owner also would enjoy great fishing and a distant view of the America's Cup races when the event comes to San Francisco in 2013. But taking ownership of the island may turn out to be a long-term proposition, with no guarantee of being able to sell it for a quick profit. According to Higbeen Mr Durning, a retired business owner, took possession of property from David Glickman, sometime in the 1970s. Glickman had bought the land in the early 1960s, asking $10 million for the island and another $10 million for mineral rights, with the hopes of cashing in on the then-increased demand for rock and gravel as parts of San Francisco Bay were filled in for development. Glickman never sold the island, but ended up turning it over to Durning in exchange for some debts, Higbee said. Glickman has since died, and Durning rarely visits the island. 'If somebody came up with some money, I would sell it; otherwise, I'll leave it to my sons to get even with them,' he told the San Francisco Chronicle earlier this year.","Red Rock Island in San Francisco is completely undeveloped and is accessible only by boat or helicopter .

Flight Lieutenant Dan Cullen’s Chinook was flying at 115mph just 50ft above the ground when his co-pilot – who had been shot by the Taliban – lost consciousness and slumped forward on to his controls. As the helicopter plummeted to the ground, Flt Lieut Cullen, who is nicknamed 'Dan Dare' by his comrades, pulled his co-pilot upright with one hand while fighting to regain control of the aircraft with the other. Courage: Flight Lieutenant Dan Cullen, who saved the lives of 30 British soldiers by flying his helicopter one-handed, has been honoured by the RAF . For his skill and courage he has been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross – the RAF’s second-highest award. The drama began when Flt Lieut Cullen, a veteran of five tours of Afghanistan, was sent to pick up troops who had been clearing a Taliban bomb factory in Helmand province, southern Afghanistan. As the soldiers sprinted to his Chinook, Taliban insurgents opened fire. Flt Lieut Cullen, 31, of 18(B) Squadron based at RAF Odiham, Hampshire, heard a bang and felt a bullet pass inches behind him. Another shot punched a hole in the cockpit window and wounded his co-pilot. He said: ‘I looked round and saw a hole in the window, then saw my co-pilot had been shot in the foot. The next 30 seconds were the longest of my life as I fought every natural instinct to take off.’ Holding his nerve under enemy fire, Flt Lieut Cullen waited until every soldier was safely on board. But shortly after taking off, his co-pilot lost consciousness. He slumped forward over the dual  controls, causing the Chinook to suddenly plummet towards the ground. Flt Lieut Cullen reacted instantly, forcing his stricken colleague back into his seat with his left hand, while controlling the Chinook with his right. The drama began when Flt Lieut Cullen was sent in a Chinook helicopter to pick up troops who had been clearing a Taliban bomb factory in Helmand province (file picture) Eventually, the injured co-pilot was revived sufficiently to be pulled into the rear where he was treated by other crewmen in the dramatic rescue in April last year. DFC recipients are said to have carried out ‘acts of valour, courage or devotion to duty whilst flying in active operations against the enemy’. The citation for Flt Lieut Cullen, who is married to Emma, 29, states: ‘Throughout this incident Cullen maintained a sublime level of composure that was an inspiration to his crew. His personal courage, strong leadership, exceptional flying skills and rapid intervention were directly responsible for the safe recovery of the troops.’ The award was one of 131 operational honours handed out last week for the period from April 1 to September 31, 2011, for actions during Operation Herrick 14 in Afghanistan. They include the Queen’s Gallantry Medal given to an explosives specialist who spent eight hours in a narrow, pitch-black tunnel defusing a massive  Taliban bomb in Helmand last August. The space was so tight that Captain James Fidell, 28, from York, could not wear body armour as he deactivated the 110lb device by hand in sweltering heat.","Flight Lieutenant Dan Cullen, 31, has received the Distinguished Flying Cross ."

Cuba will celebrate next week’s Good Friday for the first time since the 1959 Cuban revolution, following a request from Pope Benedict during his visit to the island, according to state media. Cuban President Raul Castro agreed to Benedict’s request to recognise the day Christians commemorate Jesus’s crucifixion and has declared the day a public holiday. Benedict requested the holiday as part of Easter celebrations during a meeting with President Raul Castro in Havana on Tuesday, the Vatican said.

Benedict met for about half an hour with Fidel Castro, who is a Jesuit-educated altar boy-turned-revolutionary leader. His 1998 hosting of Pope John Paul II marked a turning point in the church's relations with Cuba. Pope Benedict XVI used his visit to Cuba last week to criticise the 50-year-old trade embargo imposed by the U.S.. The Pope claimed the blockade, introduced after Cuba’s Communist revolution in 1959 and strengthened three years later, was an unfair burden on Cuba's people after the meeting with Fidel Castro. The Pontiff, who has now arrived back in Rome, made the comments at Havana airport alongside current president, Fidel's brother Raul, after celebrating Mass in front of huge crowds in Havana. He said Cubans should be ‘forging a society of wide horizons, renewed and reconciled’. He added: ‘No one should feel excluded from taking up this exciting search by the limitations of their basic freedoms, or excused from this by indolence or a lack of material resources - a situation which is worsened when restrictive economic measures, imposed from outside the country, unfairly burden its people.'","Pope Benedict requested the holiday during his visit to Cuba last week .

As a space enthusiast fascinated by NASA, then 19-year-old Jeffery Ault was looking forward watching the Challenger blast off into space while on a visit to Florida. On the day of the launch – January 28, 1986 – he brought his Super 8 home video to the Kennedy Space Centre site, less than ten miles from the launch site. After the event, the film sat in a box of home movies in Mr Ault’s house for the next quarter century. He unearthed it only last week. In the clip, exclusively obtained by the Huffington Post, excited watchers can be heard buzzing with excitement. It is . clear spectators did not know the gravity of the situation after the . Challenger exploded 73 seconds after lift-off. Scroll down for video . Disaster striking: Jeffery Ault captured the Challenger explosion on Super 8 film from a lookout at Kennedy Space Centre, about ten miles from Cape Canaveral . Explosions in the sky: The recording picks up comments from those around him - one woman initially said how beautiful it was before realizing the shuttle had blown up . All seven crew on the Challenger died in the tragedy. ‘I was hoping to see an event that I would remember for the rest of my life,’ Mr Ault told the Huffington Post. ‘I did,’ he continued, ‘Just not in the way I would have liked to.’ In an era when camera phones didn’t exist and video was expensive and cumbersome, this Super 8 footage is truly remarkable. In the film, people can be heard chattering about their excitement before the launch. After the shuttle fires up, people can be heard commenting on how great the launch is. ‘Excellent, oh, wow! That was cool,’ one man can be heard saying. Fatal blast: When the space shuttle Challenger exploded, the rocket boosters darted off into the sky, leaving the shuttle cabin to plummet to the ocean floor . In memoriam: All seven crew of the Challenger space shuttle died that day. (L-R front row) Astronauts Mike Smith, Dick Scobee, Ron McNair and (L-R, rear row) Ellison Onizuka, school teacher Christa McAuliffe, Greg Jarvis, and Judith Resnik . But when the shuttle exploded 73 seconds into the flight, those on the ground were unaware ‘Oh, that’s beautiful,’ one woman says.. Seconds later, former NASA public affairs officer Steve Nesbitt can be heard announcing from Mission Control: ‘Listen very carefully to the situation. Obviously, a major malfunction.’ Super 8 mm film was and is a popular way of capturing moving pictures. Originally released by Kodak in 1965, it was marketed as an improvement to regular 8 mm film and did not originally include audio. Though it waned in popularity after video was introduced, the medium is still used by some film makers and documentarians to achieve a grainier, dated look. Moments later, he says: ‘The vehicle . has exploded. We are looking at – checking with recovery forces to see . what can be done at this point.’ The . footage captures shock on the ground. ‘The vehicle has exploded!’ a man . repeats. A woman responds: ‘Oh please, don’t say that!’ Recently, . another home video of the explosion was unearthed. Bob Karman was at . the Orlando airport returning from a trip to Disney World with his . family. Until the discovery of Mr Karman’s tape, it was believed that the only home video of the Challenger disaster in existence belonged to Jack Moss, who made a four-minute clip of the tragedy from his home in Winter Haven. The Challenger spacecraft plunged into the Atlantic off the Florida coast at 11.38am; parts were eventually discovered at the bottom of the ocean. The cause of the accident was a faulty seal in one of the shuttle's rockets which compromised the fuel tanks. The shuttle had no escape system for the astronauts but it became known later that several of those on board could have survived the initial explosion. Investigations were ultimately inconclusive. Then president Ronald Regan ordered an investigation into the Challenger catastrophe where poor management and a disregard of safety advice were said to have played a role in the disaster. It resulted in a break of around three years in NASA's shuttle program. Among the seven on board the Challenger shuttle was Christa McAuliffe, the first member of the Teacher In Space Project, after she beat 11,000 candidates to the coveted role. The unique trip, where she planned to teach American students from space, gained the program much publicity particularly because Mrs McAuliffe had an immediate rapport with the U.S. media and public. Part of the excitement over the 'citizen astronaut' was the reason why so many people watched the Challenger disaster first-hand including many schoolchildren. Other media: Many people were watching the launch on live television when it happened; there was no such thing as YouTube or camera phones .

Air passengers face long delays at passport control this Easter because of ‘gridlock’ caused by a shortage of border staff, the UK’s major airlines have warned. Their grim predictions were borne out last night when passengers at Heathrow complained of two and a half hour delays. One Terminal 5 passenger, Erica North, who had flown in from San Francisco, said only three of the 25 immigration desks were manned. Nightmare journeys: The Government was told to expect problems with cuts to staffing at UK airports during the bank holiday weekend . The 29-year-old psychologist said: ‘It’s horrendous. I’ve been waiting two and a half hours. The whole waiting area is full and no one is explaining what’s going on.’ The chaotic scenes follow a broadside at the Government by the UK’s 11 leading airlines including British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, bmi British Midland and easyJet, who said millions of passengers are facing ‘unacceptable’ queues getting back into the country. They told Home Secretary Theresa May that staff shortages at immigration, bottlenecks and inefficiencies mean: ‘At peak travel periods such as the Easter holidays, there is the very real chance of gridlock at UK airports.’ Chaos: In a worse case scenario, scenes like the one pictured of people queuing in Heathrow during the Christmas snow disruption, in 2010, could be repeated . They said the problem has been exacerbated by a return to ‘100 per cent passport checks’ – following a row last year over lax checks – at a time when UK Border Force staff numbers have been cut. The predictions of Easter air chaos were made in leaked letters to Mrs May from the British Air Transport Association representing the 11 major UK airlines, and in a back-up one from Virgin Atlantic which spoke of impending ‘gridlock at peak travel periods, such as the Easter holidays.’ Tight control: Home Secretary Theresa May was warned that the problem had been exacerbated by a return to 100 per cent passport checks . The letter from BATA chief executive Simon Buck said: ‘The UK Border Force will almost certainly struggle to manage the volume of passengers and queue times at major airports will lengthen. ‘The subsequent impact on airline operations, passenger experience and satisfaction could be significant, especially at peak travel times such as Easter or during the Queen’s Jubilee celebrations.’ The aim was to shame the Government into abandoning further cuts in Border Force staff. British Airways is expecting today to be its busiest day over the Easter holiday with up to 86,000 passengers travelling. More than a million passengers are set to arrive at Heathrow alone between now and the end of the Easter school break. Sunday, April 15 is expected to be the busiest day with 123,350 arriving home ahead of the new school term. Airports say ‘unacceptable’ peak time queues can already exceed two hours, but the Immigration Service Union says that at the worst times they can exceed four and half hours leaving thousands crammed into arrivals halls. Lucy Moreton, the union’s deputy general secretary, warned security was at risk from job cuts. ‘Those who would wish us harm only need to be lucky once,’ she said. Unions say ministers will have to draft in ‘contingency’ border staff who have recently retired and with a maximum of two-days’ refresher training because current staffing rosters ‘are not flexible.’ The Home Office said it was putting more Border Force staff on passport control duty over the Easter holiday – but declined to say how many. Backlog: Around 2,500-3,000 passengers were forced to squeeze into the passport checking area of Heathrow's Terminal 5 as they wait to be seen by four UK Border Agency staff during trouble in November, last year . Brian Moore, head of the 7,400-strong UK Border Force, insisted: ‘There’s not a problem. My job is to make sure our borders are secure. This speculation is unhelpful, unnecessary and alarmist.’ A Border Force spokesman said: ‘The Border Force is prepared for the busy Easter period and has ensured extra staff will be working to carry out vital security checks.’ Departures from Liverpool, Luton and Gatwick to Nice were among those cancelled, with other routes to and from the regional French hub airports severely affected. And a looming strike by Spanish pilots has forced British Airways partner Iberia to cancel journeys between Heathrow and Madrid on Easter Monday. Passengers hoping to travel over the Easter weekend - a peak time when 1.5million holiday makers expect to travel overseas - have been warned to check for delays. But it is not all bad news. The threat of a baggage-handlers strike by staff at Stansted this weekend has been lifted while negotiations between the GMB union and Swissport, the ground handling company, continue. But this development is likely to come as little relief for anyone booked on an Iberia flight. Pilots are planning to strike on Mondays and Fridays from April 9 until July 20 due to a dispute over a new low-cost subsidiary, Iberia Express, set to take over loss-making routes.",But there's some relief as industrial action by baggage-handlers in Stansted over Easter weekend is called off .

An enterprising young man who can’t walk has become his village’s favourite gardener after rigging up a lawnmower to his wheelchair. Simon Wakelin, 20, who has a rare genetic condition causing muscle wasting throughout his body - steers his souped-up wheelchair across the grass to create perfectly mowed lawns. Mr Wakelin has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and been wheelchair bound from the age of eight. He said: 'I always enjoyed keeping the lawn in shape and being outdoors. 'When I lost the use of my legs as my muscles weakened, I found myself unable to do many of the things I had done before. 'But if something gets in my way I just find a way around it. It’s hard sometimes but I find a way somehow.' Simon enlisted the help of engineering neighbour Malcolm Seaborne to create a lawn mower wheelchair to revitalise his village lawns. He said: 'I have been driving all my life. As a kid I was cutting grass and driving tractors on my grandfather’s farm. 'As I got older I found I couldn’t do it anymore and a couple of years ago I started thinking about what I could do. 'I thought: ‘Well I can’t drive a tractor any more so I will make my wheelchair into one’. 'I went up to my neighbour Malcolm and asked him if he could help me build a lawn mower. He likes to get his teeth into things. My dream would be to drive a tractor again.' Malcolm welded an attachable frame to lock the lawn mower to the front of his wheelchair. With the quick click of a clip, he can now be cutting grass in minutes. He now charges a small fee from villagers in Rhydargaeau, near Carmarthen, West Wales, to take on their overgrown gardens. He said: 'Putting together the lawnmower and giving my own business a go has been great. 'It has given me a means to earn an income and it is a great way to meet new people. 'Having a disability does not have to stop you from doing the things you want to.' Simon (left) pictured with his brother Adam, who died from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy when he was 14 . Simon loved driving tractors when he was younger and was determined to continue doing something useful . Simon, whose breathing is aided by a ventilator, has even mowed the lawn at Anna Ryder Richardson’s Welsh wildlife park in Tenby. Diagnosed with DMD at 16 months, Simon struggled to stay standing as he grew older - falling over becoming more frequent as the DMD develops. He said: 'I went to school one day walking and then I sat down and went to lift my leg and I just couldn’t. I came home in a wheelchair. 'One moment you can be walking and then you’re in a wheelchair.' Simon’s parents, Roy and Maxine Wakelin, are his full-time carers.Mr Wakelin said it was a miracle that Simon is approaching his 21st birthday party in a few weeks. He said: 'Simon caught pneumonia when he was 14 and only just about survived it. 'He was down to four stone and the doctors gave him a 30 per cent chance of pulling through. Not many of the boys do pull through it. 'Even able bodied people struggle with pneumonia. But he is stubborn - he has a hell of a strong character and personality on him.' Simon was an active child but was wheel-chair bound by the time he was eight due to a genetic muscle-wasting disease . Simon’s older brother, Adam, also suffered from DMD and died from the condition aged 14 in 2003. Mother Mrs Wakelin said: 'He would push his wheelchair to the limit when he got it and they would have to repair it every weekend. He used to do wheelies. 'He now has a £13,000 electric wheelchair quad bike, thanks to the REACT charity, which means he can go on the beach and up in the fields. 'With Simon we don’t try and have any obstacles. There is always some way we can overcome them. 'He wants a hedge trimmer next!'","Simon 'has a hell of a strong character', says his proud father .

A star of the Harry Potter films who . drank stolen champagne as he went on the rampage during the London . riots was jailed for two years yesterday. Jamie Waylett, who played Hogwarts . bully Vincent Crabbe, was part of a gang of at least four people who . took to the streets on August 8 last year, the third night of violence . in the capital. The 22-year-old was captured on CCTV several times during the evening, often with a hood over his head. At one point, the footage shows him accepting a bottle of champagne from a rioter who had just looted a nearby Sainsbury’s. The jury took three-and-a-half hours to find him guilty of violent disorder at Wood Green Crown Court in north London. But they cleared him of having an article with intent to destroy or damage property in respect of a petrol bomb. The actor, of West Hampstead in north London, refused to give evidence . in court, but insisted in a police interview that he had only taken . possession of the Molotov cocktail because he felt intimidated by peer . pressure. He had already admitted handling stolen goods - a bottle of Champagne . was handed to him by his brother moments after it had been looted from a . ransacked Sainsbury's store. After the verdicts were passed. Judge . Simon Carr told the jury of five men and seven women: 'Thank you very . much indeed for the care you have taken on this short but important . case.' Past: Waylett, left, played bully Vincent Crabbe - an ally of Draco Malfoy - in the Harry Potter films . Waylett - believed to be good friends with fellow Harry Potter stars . Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint - admitted he had been an idiot but . said he had been 'caught up in the hype and euphoria of it all'. He met his brother Richard at their grandfather's house and the pair ended up in Camden Town after a drink. He was initially spotted on CCTV dashing across Chalk Farm Road at . 10.45pm after a gang smashed in the front windows of a Sainsbury's . supermarket, said prosecutor Rebekah Hummerstone. 'Moments later, he accepted a bottle of sparkling wine from a friend who is also seen on the footage carrying a number of bottles,' she added. About 90 minutes later, Waylett was again spotted on the CCTV with his hood up and could be seen trying to cover the lower part of his face with a scarf. His companions also had masked faces. 'He and the other members of his group were carrying petrol bombs,' said Ms Hummerstone. Waylett was arrested after a painstaking review of Camden Council CCTV footage. During an interview, he told officers: 'I was there but I wasn't doing nothing bad. 'A lot of people I knew were there so I wouldn't have done anything stupid. I was just being an idiot. 'I saw groups of youths smashing corner shops, I saw everything going off at Sainsbury's, I was standing in that area. 'There was a bottle going round, my brother passed me a bottle, I had a sip out of that. 'I have no clue where that came from, that's the honest truth. I didn't loot nothing, I didn't do anything stupid, but I was there.' Asked about the petrol bomb, he replied: 'A lot of people came up to me and my brother and I recognised one of them. Next thing I know they said ""take that"". 'I get quite a lot of trouble with people in the area so I'm not really confrontational. 'I have been threatened enough times and people know where I live. 'I have had threats in the past but I can't go to the police, there's no action from them. I'm the one that has to live with it.' Co-stars: Waylett appeared in the Harry Potter films alongside Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and Daniel Radcliffe . He admitted holding the petrol bomb, but insisted he had given it back - though the court heard he later claimed he had thrown it in a rubbish bin in nearby Primrose Hill. Emily Dummett, defending Waylett, said there was no evidence of him using or threatening violence and his presence during the riots was not enough to convict. He denied having an article with intent to destroy or damage property and violent disorder. The actor appeared in six Harry Potter films before his character was written out in the final Deathly Hallows instalment. Earlier Ms Dummett, told the court: 'He acknowledges the seriousness of his actions. He struggled in school, achieving three low grade GCSEs. 'He completed a painting and decorating qualification at college but he is not in work at the moment. 'Although he had the good fortune to be one of the actors in the Harry Potter films he didn't handle the publicity well and began using cannabis. 'His usage increased and that led to a conviction in 2009 for possession and later cultivation. 'Inevitably what followed was his character being written out of the films. 'He has a difficult relationship with his mother, and relies on his grandfather for support. 'He knows the sentence of the court must be on that deters other people from partaking in this sort of behaviour in future.'","Jamie Waylett was caught on camera during the .

Paula Stevenson, seen here with a picture of her baby girl Hayley, describe her daughter's treatment at Birmingham Children's Hospital as 'brutal' A coroner has questioned if a baby girl who died in hospital was under the care of ‘work experience’ nurses. He made the remark yesterday after hearing that one-year-old Hayley Fullerton had been looked after by clinical support workers who had made errors on her medical notes. This included ‘incorrect’ entries and one afternoon that saw an eight-hour gap in observation notes on Hayley’s condition. The little girl died of a massive heart attack at Birmingham  Children’s Hospital after medical staff ignored her family’s desperate pleas to help her. At one stage, her despairing mother even offered a £100 ‘bribe’ to a nurse to pay more attention to Hayley. Yesterday, coroner Aidan Cotter heard that, in the days before she died, Hayley was put under the care of clinical support workers. These are NHS workers who are paid less than qualified nurses and recruited for their ‘commitment and enthusiasm’ rather than any academic qualifications. The coroner said: ‘This was more “work experience”, somewhat?’ Senior nurse Jackie Clinton, manager of the ward Hayley was on, denied this, replying: ‘No, not work experience. They go through a period of six to eight months’ training, including observation, monitoring and how to read notes.’ But Mrs Clinton conceded that the clinical support workers looking after Hayley had made ‘incorrect’ entries on her medical notes. Hayley Fullerton was born with a hole in her heart, and had to undergo surgery aged 10-months-old to correct it . It was during the recovery from the surgery when complications arose, ultimately leading to her tragic death . She also accepted that, on one day, they had failed to update the notes all afternoon, leaving an eight-hour gap in observations of Hayley’s condition. Hourly observations were supposed to be done to help doctors correctly assess Hayley, the inquest heard. Mrs Clinton, who agreed nurses had ignored the hospital’s policy of hourly check-ups, said there were not enough nurses to go round. She added that Hayley was being monitored by machines which sounded an alarm if there was any problem – but agreed that these alarms were often ignored. Paula Stevenson told an inquest her one-year-old daughter was overlooked and neglected at the hospital . She said: ‘At that time, we had a high . number of patients who needed high dependency care. Nurses often have . three patients. They can’t put down children and go to the alarm every . time.’ Adam Weitzman, representing Hayley’s . family, put it to Mrs Clinton that Hayley was put under the care of . clinical support workers because nurses regarded her condition as less . serious than other children on the ward. Hayley was born with a blockage which . stopped blood reaching her lungs. She was operated on shortly after her . birth in Northern Ireland, and sent for further surgery in Birmingham in .

Emergency plans for soldiers to drive petrol tankers to stop a threatened strike plunging Britain into chaos have been drawn up by the Government. The contingency plans are aimed at preventing a repeat of the turmoil caused by protesting lorry drivers when Tony Blair was Prime Minister. The results of a strike ballot of Britain’s 2,000 tanker drivers will be announced tomorrow – and both Ministers and well-placed sources in the drivers’ union Unite believe they will vote in favour of a walkout starting on April 3. Blockade buster: An Army tanker pressed into action during the 2000 protests. Emergency plans for soldiers to drive petrol tankers to stop a threatened strike plunging Britain into chaos have been drawn up . Coalition Ministers are determined not to see a repeat of the widespread disruption caused in 2000, when garages, supermarkets, schools, hospitals and airports were badly hit, catching the Labour Government unawares. Ministers are ready to use emergency powers to keep such vital services open. They will use police to stop any threatened blockade by striking drivers, and this week they will start assembling a squad of up to 300 qualified Army lorry drivers to replace the tanker drivers if necessary. Motorists will be urged to keep their tanks topped up, though Ministers stress there is no need to panic. Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude last night issued an 11th-hour plea to the tanker drivers – who earn about £45,000 a year, but are threatening strike action over pay, pensions and working conditions. Mr Maude, who is in charge of the contingency plans, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘We are calling on Unite and the employers involved to work together to reach an agreement that will avert industrial action. ‘Widespread strike action affecting . fuel supply at our supermarkets, garages and airports could cause . disruption across the country. ‘The general public should not and must not suffer from this dispute and strike action is manifestly not the answer. Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude (pictured) last night issued an 11th-hour plea to the tanker drivers - who earn about £45,000 a year, but are threatening strike action over pay, pensions and working conditions . ‘Although we are pushing for an agreement, we have learnt the lessons of the past and stand ready to act to minimise disruption to motorists, to industry and, in particular, to our emergency services, in the event of a strike.' The contingency plans have been drawn . up by Mr Maude, Transport Secretary Justine Greening, Home Secretary . Theresa May, Health Secretary Andrew Lansley and Energy Secretary Ed . Davey. They aim to head off a . rerun of the blockade of oil refineries 12 years ago, which caused . disruption to supplies and dented the popularity of Tony Blair’s . Government. Unite started . its ballot of more than 2,000 drivers, working for seven major fuel . distribution firms and covering 90 per cent of drivers supplying petrol . to UK forecourts, three weeks ago. It closes tomorrow, with the result . expected later in the day. Unite . says on its online ballot form: ‘While the oil industry rakes in . multi-billion-pound profits, the drivers who supply fuel to forecourts . across the country are being squeezed. ‘For . over a year, Unite has been trying to convince the industry to bring . some stability back into the supply of this vital national commodity. 'Yet, . behind the scenes, the major employers have been slashing drivers’ terms and conditions and cutting corners on training and safety in a bid . to win contracts. Enough is enough.’ In response, bosses say drivers are well-rewarded, working just 37 hours a week for their £45,000 annual salary. However, Unite’s militant leader, Len . McCluskey, who is on £100,000 a year, claims that drivers’ working . conditions have deteriorated as supermarkets and oil companies contract . out work to haulage firms which negotiate separate wage and conditions . deals with their drivers. The . union is Labour’s biggest financial backer. If the strike goes ahead, . Labour leader Ed Miliband will come under pressure to say if he backs . it. The planned protest coincides with . growing frustration among Britain’s 36million motorists over the high . cost of fuel, the issue that was the root cause of the action by lorry . drivers and farmers in 2000. In . last week’s Budget, Chancellor George Osborne said a 3p per litre fuel . duty increase will take effect on August 1, as planned. Mr . Blair’s delay in getting to grips with the 2000 protest sent his . ratings plummeting. He later said it was one of his worst moments in No . 10. Militant: Unite leader Len McCluskey claims that drivers' working conditions have deteriorated as supermarkets and oil companies contract out work to haulage firms . It led to many petrol stations running out of fuel. The NHS was placed on red alert, with hospitals cancelling non-essential operations and the National Blood Service reporting difficulties in moving supplies around the UK. Supermarkets began rationing food – panic-buying led to Sainsbury’s warning that it would run out of food within days – and schools began to close. The blockade was broken when the Government started to deploy military tankers. It used emergency powers to supply 2,000 designated petrol stations with fuel for essential services, with the police supplying escorts to ensure that tankers got through. Unite claims tanker drivers ‘work in an increasingly fragmented, pressurised industry’ with ‘corners being cut on safety and training in a bid to squeeze profits and win contracts’ and describe it as ‘a clear case of a predatory industry putting its greed before the wider well-being’. A spokeswoman for the union said yesterday: ‘We have been pushing for over a year for more stability across the industry. The drivers have had enough.’","Will Labour back a crippling strike by union Unite, its biggest donor?

Suicidal: Laura Johnson, 20, leaving court today where she told jurors she has self-harmed since 14 and tried to kill herself six times . The millionaire’s daughter accused of taking part in a looting rampage during last summer’s riots yesterday blamed her descent into lawlessness on a double rape. Laura Johnson, 20, told a court she was depressed after her ordeal and had repeatedly tried to take her own life. This vulnerability led her to trust a convicted robber and drug dealer who later forced her to drive a getaway car during the looting spree, she said. But the prosecution at Inner London Crown Court asked her if the rape allegation, which went unreported, was something she had made up to help her defence. The former grammar school pupil denied this. She said Emmanuel Okubote, who goes by the street names Sylar or T-Man, terrified her into chauffeuring him and his friends with talk of guns and knives. She also claims he grabbed her by the throat and showed her a video of a kidnap victim being tortured with bleach. Giving evidence yesterday, Johnson wept as she told how she had been self-harming since the age of 14 and had made six suicide attempts after her boyfriend ended their relationship last year. She had also spent time as an in-patient at a psychiatric hospital. The final devastating blow, she said, was when she was raped by two men on July 14. Since the alleged attack, the University of Exeter student said T-Man had become a ‘pillar of strength’, although she denied they had a sexual relationship. She said: ‘I was growing more affectionate towards him. I fancied him a little bit. He was very kind and very supportive. I basically broke down in front of him and the stuff in my past came out. ‘I told him about being suicidal, my ex-boyfriend and being raped. He listened to all that, which suggests an affection. ‘He encouraged me to go back to university, go to the library and do essays. He was trying to be a positive influence.’ Johnson said she had been introduced to T-Man, 20, through Charlie Fryett, a friend she met in a psychiatric hospital. On . the day of the riots, she said her mental state was ‘very bad’ and in . the weeks before she had regularly wanted to kill herself by ‘taking as . many tablets as I could find…so I would not wake up in the morning’. Family home: Johnson has been bailed to her parents' large, detached house in Orpington . She said: ‘I was raped by two males. I didn’t talk to anyone at first. ‘My mental health was worse than ever before. I hated life and myself so much.’ Sandy Canavan, prosecuting, asked Johnson if the rape allegation was something she had ‘created to add substance to her defence’. Frenzy: Johnson's trial heard how hundreds of rioters scurried 'like wild rats' around Stone Lake Retail Park in Charlton (above) Johnson said that she had gone to meet . T-Man, who she knew had been in prison, to drop off a phone charger in . Catford, South-East London, at 6.30pm on August 8 – the worst night of . the riots – but was taken by surprise when three other men wearing . balaclavas and hoodies jumped into the back of her Smart car. Because they were ‘not the sort of people you say no to’, she then drove her passengers for eight hours as they robbed other looters and pillaged televisions, cigarettes and alcohol from branches of Currys, Comet and a BP petrol station. She added: ‘The first thing T-Man said to me was “drive”. It was short, sharp, abrupt. ‘He had never spoken to me like that before. I felt scared, shocked. They had a knife. I feared being stabbed.’ Johnson says looters threatened her and made her drive them around as they robbed people and shops during the summer riots . The prosecution says she was a willing participant. Johnson said she felt relieved when police finally arrested her. Johnson, of Orpington, Kent, denies three counts of burglary and three alternative charges of handling stolen goods. Her co-defendant, a 17-year-old from Lewisham who cannot be named for legal reasons, has admitted burgling a petrol station but denies the other charges. A third man, 18-year-old Alexander Elliott-Joahill has pleaded guilty to burglary and handling stolen goods. The case continues.","Laura Johnson, 20, said she has self-harmed since she was 14 and had mental health treatment .

As any football fan knows, ‘mind games’ and intimidation are all too familiar in professional sport. Yet such behaviour is already rearing its ugly head at primary school. Children as young as eight say they are the victims of psychological warfare and bullying on the playing field. They are teased, taunted and sworn at during sports and PE lessons, while some pupils are physically attacked by opponents who kick, punch, headbutt and trip them. 'Warfare': Young pupils have told of being bullied, teased and taunted during sports and PE lessons at school. (Posed by models) Some are so dismayed that they give up the sport rather than risk further abuse. A survey of 1,250 children aged eight to 16 found that 51.1 per cent admitted to being a victim of ‘mental intimidation’ on the sports field. Among the 54 eight-year-olds questioned, almost half said an opposition player or team mate had targeted them with teasing, taunting, swearing, threats or had deliberately put them off when they were trying to concentrate. Some 15.4 per cent said they cried and 11.5 per cent admitted being scared as a result of their treatment on the pitch. Across all ages, 67.4 per cent said they had witnessed some form of verbal abuse and 55 per cent had seen physical violence such as a player being tripped up, pushed over or kicked, or being struck with equipment such as a bat or racquet. Among the eight-year-olds, the proportion witnessing violence while playing sport at school was 42.6 per cent. Bad example: The survey found footballer Wayne Rooney was rated as the worst role model for children by parents polled . Twenty-two per cent had seen a player being pushed over by an opponent or team mate. The . survey was published by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the Chance to . Shine campaign, which plans to bring competitive cricket – and its . educational benefits – to at least two million state school children by . 2015. To help teach young . people how to play matches in a sporting manner, MCC and Chance to Shine . are delivering a nationwide scheme to encourage ‘fair play’ in schools. From today, coaches will address assemblies and give lessons in sportsmanship to around half a million children in 4,000 state schools. Families have backed the move as more than two-thirds of parents of eight- to 16-year-olds (66.4 per cent) said they have witnessed different forms of ‘mental intimidation’ while watching their children play. More than two-fifths of parents said their child lost confidence after being bullied on the playing field and a fifth felt they were reluctant to take part in sport because of the ‘mind games’. Almost 7 per cent reported that their child gave up at least one sport as a result, according to the survey. Mothers were more likely to take up their concerns with a teacher, coach or referee. However, a third of fathers confronted the bully themselves. The survey also found that footballer Wayne Rooney was rated as the worst role model for children by parents polled (17.8 per cent), followed by John Terry (17 per cent). Wasim Khan, chief executive of Chance to Shine, said: ‘We are teaching children from a young age to play competitively but to respect the opposition as well as their team mates. We need to stamp out this bullying in school sport.’","Children give up sport rather than risk more abuse, survey finds .

Instead Sir David said consumers would opt to watch ‘big events’ in 3D such as World Cup football matches, the forthcoming Royal Wedding, or ground-breaking new nature or history shows. In cinema, it seems Britain’s 3D boom may be over before it really even began. Film fans fed up with inflated prices and disillusioned by the lack of added value from watching many movies in the format,  opted to stick with traditional 2D showings instead. Little over a fifth of box office sales were for 3D films in 2011, compared to 27.5 per cent in 2010, according to figures from global industry analysts Rentrak EDI.

Scientists analysing the surface of a giant asteroid are puzzling over bright spots that represent some of the purest materials seen so far by a Nasa spacecraft. Nasa released new images of the asteroid Vesta taken by the orbiting Dawn spacecraft that show some places on the surface twice as bright as others. Vesta is one of the brightest objects in the solar system and the only asteroid in the so-called main belt between Mars and Jupiter visible to the naked eye from Earth. Sparkling: Bright material extends up to 19 miles out from the crater Canuleia on Vesta, which measures six miles across . This shows a perspective view of a layered young crater in the Rheasilvia basin at Vesta created from laying images from the mission's low-altitude mapping orbit - an average of 130 miles above the surface - atop a digital terrain model . The bright material, found mostly around craters, appeared as a result of rocks slamming into the surface and exposing it. Researchers are still trying to determine what it is made of but believe it is pristine and unchanged from the asteroid's formation some four billion years ago. ‘Our analysis finds this bright material originates from Vesta and has undergone little change since the formation of Vesta over four billion years ago,’ said Jian-Yang Li, a Dawn participating scientist at the University of Maryland, College Park. ‘We're eager to learn more about what minerals make up this material and how the present Vesta surface came to be.’ The bright areas vary from several hundred feet to around 10 miles across. The interplay of bright and dark material at the rim of Marcia crater on Vesta is visible in this image mosaic . Rock on: A young crater on Vesta that is nine miles in diameter with layering visible in the crater walls, along with large boulders that were thrown out in the material ejected from the impact . There are also a wide variety of distinct dark deposits across its surface. The dark materials on Vesta can appear dark grey, brown and red. They sometimes appear as small, well-defined deposits around impact craters. They also can appear as larger regional deposits, like those surrounding the impact craters scientists have nicknamed the ‘snowman.’ ‘One of the surprises was the dark material is not randomly distributed,’ said David Williams, a Dawn participating scientist at Arizona State University. ‘This suggests underlying geology determines where it occurs.’ The dark materials seem to be related to impacts and their aftermath. Scientists theorise carbon-rich asteroids could have hit Vesta at speeds low enough to produce some of the smaller deposits without blasting away the surface. Dawn has been studying Vesta since it entered orbit last year. The spacecraft is set to depart Vesta this summer and cruise to another asteroid, Ceres, arriving in 2015.

"Sat nav failed to mention the 15 kilometres of water and mud between the tourists and their destination . Car had to be abandoned as the tide came in . By . Rachel Rickard Straus . PUBLISHED: . 05:52 EST, 16 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:33 EST, 16 March 2012 . Three Japanese tourists holidaying in Australia came unstuck when their satnav told them they could drive from the mainland to an island – failing to mention the 15 kilometres of water and mud in between. As they drove their hired car from Moreton Bay in Queensland to nearby North Stradbroke Island they started to notice the firm gravel surface they were driving on giving way to the renowned bay mangrove mud. However, confident their satnav would direct them to a road soon, they decided to plough on, managing to travel around 500 metres before their Hyundai Getz was up to its axles in mud. Oops!: As the tied started to come in, the Japanese tourists had to abandon their hired car, retrieving some of their valuables first . To make matters worse the tide started to come in and soon forced them to seek help and abandon the vehicle. Just four hours later the car was stranded in two metres of water – to the great amusement of onlookers on the shore and passengers on passing boats and ferries. Yuzu Noda, 21, said she was listening to the GPS and ‘it told us we could drive down there. ‘It kept saying it would navigate us to a road. We got stuck…there’s lots of mud.’ Difficult driving conditions: The tide comes up so high that soon ferries start to pass by the abandoned car . Sight for sore eyes: Passengers on passing boats and ferries were amused when they saw a little stranded Hyundai in the ocean . She and her travel companions Tomonari Saeki, 22, and Keita Osada, 21, instead had to ditch their plans for a day trip to the island and headed back to the Gold Coast courtesy of a lift from the RACQ tow truck driver who was called to the stranded car. No such luck for the hired car though – after assessing the situation no attempt was made to recover it. A four wheel drive owner who saw the incident had considered winching out the car, but abandoned any attempt due to the speed of the oncoming tide. Plan B: The tourists had to abandon their car and day trip plans when their vehicle became bogged down in mangrove mud . The students from Tokyo who are due to return home tomorrow, said the experience would not put them off returning to Australia for another visit. 'We want to come back to Australia again. Everyone is very nice, even today,' Ms Yuzu said. Remaining upbeat, Mr Tomonari joked that the car may have got stuck because it was built in Korea. ‘Maybe if it was Japanese it would be okay,’ he said. Scuppered: The three tourists had to rethink their day trip plans, but are keen to return to Australia for another visit . He added: ‘It has rained every day on our six day holiday. Hopefully next time we come back it will be sunny.’ The car was covered by insurance, but the tourists will have to pay up about $1500 in excess charges.","Sat nav failed to mention the 15 kilometres of water and mud between the tourists and their destination .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:41 EST, 23 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:18 EST, 23 March 2012 . Three white men involved in the beating and fatal rundown of a black Mississippi man pleaded guilty Thursday to federal hate crimes and admitted to a months-long pattern of brutal harassment against blacks. Dylan Butler, 20; Deryl Dedmon, 19; and John Aaron Rice, 19; entered the pleas in federal court to conspiracy to commit a hate crime and to committing a hate crime while a day earlier Dedmon pleaded guilty in state court to a murder charge. Authorities said there . could be more arrests as their investigation continues. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Deryl Dedmon, 19, (left), John Aaron Rice, 19, (center) and Dylan . Butler, 20, (right) entered guilty pleas to conspiracy to commit . a hate crime and committing a hate crime . U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves set sentencing for June 8 and ordered all three to be held in custody. The three are from the town of Brandon, a Jackson suburb, and were accused of going to the majority-black capital city on numerous occasions to harass or assault black people. Prosecutor Sheldon Beer read the allegations against the three, saying they harassed or assaulted black people who they thought were homeless or intoxicated. Victims were chosen because they thought they would not tell police, authorities said. Victim: James Craig Anderson, 47, was beaten and run over to death after Dedmon, Rice and Butler found him outside a hotel last June . The harassment began in April 2011, culminating in the death of James Craig Anderson, a 47-year-old car plant worker, on June 26. Each was charged with the same two crimes. They face up to five years in prison on the conspiracy charge and up to life on the hate crime charge. Butler and Rice were accused of driving around Jackson and throwing beer bottles at people before meeting up with Dedmon the night Mr Anderson was run over. Family's pain: On Wednesday Dedmon pleaded guilty to the murder charge as family of Mr Anderson wept in the courtroom during a statement read by the victim's sister . Planned attacks: Prosecutors stated the men's harassment against blacks began on April 2011, leading to the death of Mr Anderson, the brother of Barbara Anderson Young, who delivered her statement before the court . Sheldon said there were other occasions when one or all of the defendants threw beer bottles and used a slingshot to shoot marbles at black people. In addition, Dedmon and Rice were accused of beating at least two other black men on different occasions. Several people wept in court during the hearing. Mr Anderson who was gay with a partner of 17 years, was not believed to have been attacked because of his sexuality according to Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which could have posed a separate hate crime. Night of fun: Pictured in July, Rice was accused of driving around Jackson with Butler and throwing beer bottles at people before meeting up with Dedmon the night Mr Anderson was run over . His long-time partner James Bradfield . was not permitted to file as a plaintiff with the victim's family, . however. According to Mr Dees, 'under Mississippi law, same-sex partners have no claim . in civil actions like this,' he told Your Black World. None of the defendants made statements during the hearing, speaking only briefly to answer questions from Reeves. The victim's family had no comment. Motive: Dedmon admitted he and a group of white teens were partying outside Jackson when he suggested they find a black man to harass leading to their find of Mr Anderson . Building: The group of men drove around Jackson on several occasions prior looking for African Americans to assault by throwing objects or becoming physical with them . Thomas E. Perez, the assistant attorney general for the U.S. Justice Department's civil rights division, said: 'This is really a case about a group of racist thugs who made a sport of targeting vulnerable African Americans in Jackson and attacking them without provocation simply because of the color of their skin.' 'On a number of occasions they drove around Jackson looking for African Americans to assault,' Mr Perez said during a news conference after the hearing. 'Jackson is a wonderful community, however, for these defendants they referred to Jackson as 'Jafrica.' African Americans in Jackson were subhuman to them,' he said. Reaction: Dedmon's family, pictured in court, cried during his sentencing while they heard the night's recounts of the 19-year-old beating and driving his vehicle over the group's victim . Ongoing: Police and FBI say their investigation in the killing and hate crime is ongoing and there could be more arrests . In entering his guilty plea to the state charges on Wednesday, Dedmon admitted he and a group of white teens were partying in Puckett, a small town outside Jackson, when he suggested they find a black man to harass. They found Mr Anderson before dawn outside a hotel. Dedmon, 19, received two life sentences on those charges. On the night of the killing, Rice and Butler and others stalled Mr Anderson until Dedmon arrived, according to allegations read in court. When Dedmon arrived, Rice punched Mr Anderson and knocked him down. Dedmon straddled the man and beat him. According to a motel security guard, one of the teens went back to their vehicle after beating Mr Anderson while throwing his fist in the air shouting: 'white power!' Sentences: Rice, seen at his high school graduation, faces up to five years in prison on the conspiracy charge and up to life on the hate crime charge . The case received widespread attention after a video of Mr Anderson's death was obtained by news organizations. The video, taken by a hotel surveillance camera, shows Rice and Butler and others in a white Jeep Cherokee leaving a hotel parking lot at 5:05 a.m. Less than 20 seconds later, Dedmon's green Ford F-250 backs up and then lunges forward. Mr Anderson's shirt is illuminated in the headlights before he disappears under the vehicle next to the curb. Police said Dedmon was driving the truck that also held two teenage girls, reconvening with the rest of the group after at a local McDonald's. There Dedmon bragged to the others: 'I ran that n***** over!' according to a witness. Forgiveness: Reading a letter before Mr Anderson's family, Dedmon asked them for forgiveness saying he is a changed man . 'The actions of these defendants who have pled guilty today in this court do not represent the values of Mississippi in 2012. This is an absolute tragedy, and what this family has had to go through as a result of the actions of these young men is inexcusable,' U.S. Attorney John Dowdy said. Dan McMullen, special FBI agent in charge of Mississippi, said the agency is still investigating, but he declined to give details because the investigation is ongoing. Dedmon was initially indicted on state charges for capital murder, which in Mississippi carries a sentence of death or life in prison without parole, but District Attorney Robert Shuler Smith said prosecutors couldn't have gotten a conviction. Life sentences: With Dedmon's guilty plea to murder and committing a hate crime, he received two concurrent life sentences . For capital murder, there must be an underlying offense, which had been robbery. Mr Smith said the investigation revealed that the group did not take Mr Anderson's wallet, as investigators first believed. The family of Mr Anderson previously wrote to prosecutors asking the death penalty not be used against his attackers writing that it goes against their religion. 'We also oppose the death penalty because it historically has been used in Mississippi and the South primarily against people of color for killing whites,' the letter obtained by CNN to prosecutors read. 'Executing James’ killers will not help to balance the scales. But sparing them may help to spark a dialogue that one day will lead to the elimination of capital punishment.' During the state court hearing Wednesday, Dedmon asked the victim's family for forgiveness.' 'As I stand before you today, I am a changed man. I am a godly man. God has showed me to see no colors. God showed me that we are all made in the image of God so we are all based on the same thing,' he said. 'I do not ask y'all to forget, but I do ask y'all to forgive.' Rice is charged by the state with simple assault in the case. Rice has pleaded not guilty in that case.

"By . Martin Robinson . UPDATED: . 05:22 EST, 20 March 2012 . Court: Lavinia Desuze's son Darrell killed Richard Mannington Bowes during the London riots and she, pictured, is accused of perverting the course of justice by hampering the police investigation into his death . The mother of a teenage thug who killed a pensioner in last summer’s riots tried to cover it up by destroying his clothes, a court heard yesterday. Lavinia Desuze is alleged to have shredded the distinctive T-shirt her 16-year-old son Darrell was wearing when he attacked 68-year-old Richard Mannington Bowes. Mr Bowes was trying to put out a fire near his home in Ealing, West London, when he was punched by looter Darrell Desuze and fractured his skull on the pavement. He died in hospital three days later. Yesterday, Inner London Crown Court heard that Desuze, 31, cut up the T-shirt after spotting her son wearing it during a TV appeal for help in finding the killer. It is claimed she later told police she had dumped it  in bins behind a shop and near a motorway, but when officers searched them they had already been emptied.Darrell, now 17, pleaded guilty to manslaughter, violent disorder and burglary last week. Prosecutor Brian Altman QC said: ‘She knew he had been involved in killing Mr Bowes. Unlike others who turned in their own children, horrified at what they had seen them do, this defendant sought to prevent him from facing the justice he deserved.’ Desuze, from Hounslow, West London, denies perverting the course of justice. A ‘deliberate and deadly’ blow was landed . by Desuze on . the 68-year-old retired accountant, who was trying to quell a fire . started by a rampaging mob near his home. Left with brain damage he never awoke and died three days later. The photograph of Mr Mannington Bowes' unconscious body lying on the pavement became one of the most shocking images of last summer's riots. Prosecutor Brian Altman QC said Darrell, who went on to loot several shops after attacking him, was wearing a ‘Robbers and Villains’ top, white patterned T-shirt and Adidas bag that night. 'After his arrival home but before the police came knocking on their door, almost a week later on Sunday August 14 this defendant, we suggest, knowing what her son had been involved, took the distinctive items of clothing he had been wearing that night and having cut them up disposed of them,' he told the jury. 'The prosecution say there was only one reason why she did what she did. She realised the distinctive articles of clothing would lead to not only to her son’s identification but also to him facing justice for what he had done.' Son: Darrell Desuze, seen aiming an imaginary gun in a picture on Facebook and in a . police mugshot, punched Richard . Mannington Bowes . to the ground, killing him with a single blow . Inner London Crown Court heard prior to her and her son’s arrest a 22-year-old man had been detained by police on suspicion of Mr Bowe’s murder after being wrongly identified on the CCTV. When the Met arrived at her home in Hounslow, west London, she is alleged to have said: 'You’ve got the bloke that did it. Why are you here for my son?' Ms Desuze admitted her son had been in Ealing that night but claimed he had tried to help Mr Bowes, allegedly saying: 'He was there when he was punched. My son helped that man. He put him in the recovery position.' Help: Lying headfirst on the ground Richard Mannington Bowes, left, is assisted by Peter Firstbrook and a police officer during the riots in Ealing . But Mr Altman said she later told police she had cut the clothes her son had been wearing up and put them in two bins, one round the back of a shop and another near the A4. Tragic: Richard Mannington Bowes, pictured, hit his head on the ground and never woke up . She even agreed to take officers there to show them but when they arrived the bins had been already been emptied, the court heard. The prosecutor told jurors: 'You can conclude this defendant was deliberately lying to cover up for her son.' In a later outburst in a police car following her arrest Mr Altman said Lavinia blamed police for Mr Bowes death by sparking off the riots with the shooting of Mark Duggan, saying: 'Police can kill someone and get away with it. But a man died after being attacked in the riots, not murder, and the whole force is out.' Her son Darrell was originally charged with murder but this was dropped to manslaughter after the Crown Prosecution Service accepted his plea on that basis. He also pleaded guilty to violent disorder and burglary. Desuze had already been on a looting spree when he encountered Mr . Mannington Bowes who was trying to quell the flames being set by . rioters. Together: Darrell and Lavinia Desuze sketched at Inner London Crown Court as they sit in the dock last week . There was a stand-off between police and . rioters on Spring Bridge Road in Ealing at the time of the tragedy and . around 70 youths were lobbing missiles at officers. As Mr Mannington Bowes remonstrated with . the group and tried to stamp out a fire in a bin Desuze punched . him in the face and he fell smashing his head on the pavement. Mr Altman added: 'Because of her actions this defendant is charged with perverting the course of justice by concealing or destroying her son’s clothing, the Robbers and Villains top, the patterned white T-shirt and the distinctive Adidas bag, items which, say the prosecution, she knew would rightly point the finger of guilt at her son. 'She knew he had been in Ealing. She knew he had been involved in killing Mr Bowes so in order to prevent any link with this crime she got rid of it all for one reason and one reason only, to obstruct the course of justice.'

A pensioner spoke today of how he thought his family were going to die after their car plunged into a canal and began to sink. Bob Seddon, 68, his wife Patricia, son Nic and grandson Daniel, 16, were trapped in the car under water after it hit a brick and careered from the road into the Bridgewater Canal, Greater Manchester. As the BMW hire car quickly filled with water, Nic, who had been at the wheel, smashed his window and escaped. A salvage crew recover a black BMW car from the Bridgewater Canal after it crashed into the water leading to a dramatic rescue attempt of Bob Seddon and his family . The 45-year-old father-of-three then faced a race against time to rescue his parents and nephew Daniel. He climbed on the car’s roof and kicked in the glass with his bare feet before trying to pull the 6ft 3in teenager from the car. Bob, who was sitting in the back with Patricia, 65, unhooked the teenager’s seatbelt and pushed him forward. Nic then swam to the far bank with Daniel, who cannot swim, and was helped by two schoolboys to get him onto the bank. Without a thought for his own safety, Nic then swam back to the car in a bid to rescue his mum and dad, who were still in the back seat of the vehicle as it started to sink to the bottom. He managed to get his dad out even though he suffers from severe arthritis. A crane was needed to lift the BMW out of the canal after the car was submerged . Fire crews quickly arrived on the scene and jumped into the water. They pulled Nic and Bob to safety and used an axe to smash the car’s rear window. But they were unable to get Patricia past the rear seat headrests and had to smash a side window to pull her free as the car went underwater. She was taken unconscious to the side of the canal, where paramedics and firefighters worked to resuscitate her. She began to breathe again and was rushed to Wythenshawe Hospital, where she is still recovering. The crash happened in darkness at Canal Road, Timperley, at about 8pm on Tuesday. Bob, from Sale, a retired airport worker, who has been married to Patricia for 46 years, said: 'I thought we were going to die. I think the car hit a brick. Bob Seddon . 'It just lurched sideways and the next thing it was in the canal. I didn’t want to leave my wife. I felt terrible. The car was filling with water very quickly. I had to get out, but I knew she was in there. Thankfully the firefighters managed to get her out. 'Nic was absolutely exhausted. I don’t know how he did it. At one point, I had to hold him up because I was worried that he was going to go under the water. The fire crews were amazing. I can’t thank them enough.' Nic, who is married and lives in Sunderland, had travelled to Sale to visit his parents when the crash happened. He said: 'I’m still in shock. I’m just glad we all survived. I did what I could. I got Daniel out and then my dad, but I couldn’t get my mum out. 'There was no way I was leaving her. I kept close to the car while the firemen came to get her out. It’s your family at the end of the day. It’s everything. I thought ""it’s not going to end like this"". The nurse at the hospital said I was a hero, but the firemen were the real heroes. They saved mum’s life. She was gone and they brought her back.' Patricia Seddon needed to have her heart restarted after the accident before being rushed to Wythenshawe Hospital . Fire crews from Sale and Altrincham . stations were called to the canal bank and decided they had no option . but to go into the water. Firefighter Mark Pendlebury, 29, from Didsbury, helped Nic to the canal bank then used an axe to smash the car’s rear window. He . suffered a severe cut to his left hand and later had to have four . stitches as he tried to free Patricia as the car went underwater. Firefighter Colin Latham, 31, smashed a side window on the car and pulled Mrs Seddon back to the surface with the help of firefighter Mike Wilson, 31. All three then took her to the bank, where she was given CPR by firefighter Gary Lovatt, 39. Mr Pendlebury said: 'There was a man in the water saying his mum was still inside the car. 'I helped the gentleman to get out of the water as he was shaking with cold and struggling to stay afloat. As I went back over to the car it was starting to submerge quicker and quicker. 'I turned back to the bank to get an axe to break a window. As the car tilted up, I smashed the rear windscreen and tried to pull the woman out of the back. 'At that point, the car completely submerged. We weren’t able to pull her over the back headrests so Colin smashed the side window and we got her out and took her to the bank.' Mr Wilson, also from Sale, said: 'It was a great relief when we got her out. Thankfully she’s okay.' Two schoolboys have also been praised for their part in the dramatic rescue. Ryan Cummins and Stephen Hoyland, both 15, were walking home along the canal towpath when they heard screams and saw the black BMW’s brake lights shining out from the water. The 15-year-olds ran to help and were first on the scene. They helped drag 16-year-old Daniel out of the water onto the canal bank. Stephen, of Timperley, said: 'We just saw a man treading water with a younger boy. We ran down to the edge and grabbed one of his arms each and pulled him up to the side. 'The man he was with swam back to the car. We were then just watching by the side as there was nothing that we could do. We were shouting for help and someone came out of a nearby garden and raised the alarm. The lad was coughing up water and he couldn’t speak. 'We just did what we felt we had to do. Anyone would.' Ryan, also from Timperley, added: 'We didn’t think, we just reacted. The woman wasn’t moving or breathing when she was rescued. They were pumping her chest and it was going on for a good five minutes until she started to breathe again.' Ryan’s mum Jayne Cummins, 38, said both boys were heroes. She added: 'I am very proud of them and it is nice to see a positive story involving teenagers.'","BMW hit a brick and careered from the road into a canal .

Prosecutors are investigating seven more people over the disaster . including employees of the ship's operator, Costa Crociere, Italian . media reported. The ship's captain Francesco Schettino has been blamed for the accident, which occurred when he took the ship close to the shore of the island of Giglio to perform a display manoeuvre known as a 'salute'. He faces charges of multiple manslaughter, causing an accident and abandoning ship before the evacuation of all of those on board was complete. A pretrial hearing is due to begin on March 3. The new suspects are said to be four of the Concordia's other officers and three employees of Costa Crociere. Salvage crews are still working on pumping almost 2,400 tonnes of diesel fuel from the vast hulk, which lies partially submerged just metres from the shore of Giglio, a popular holiday island in a maritime reserve off the Tuscan coast. Earlier this week it emerged that traces of cocaine have been found on a hair sample from the captain of the stricken Costa Concordia. But experts say the discovery does  not prove that Francesco Schettino, charged with abandoning his post  when the cruise ship ran aground  last month, had used the drug. The cocaine was not found within  the actual fabric of Schettino’s hair  or in his urine – the usual signs that someone ingested the drug. Stefano Zerbi, representing some of the survivors, described the results as ‘very strange’, saying he believed the samples ‘more than anything else, had been badly preserved and contamination might have resulted’.","Officials say 32 people drowned in the disaster but only 17 bodies had been retrieved before the new announcement .

"By . Chris Hanlon . PUBLISHED: . 11:56 EST, 29 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:32 EST, 29 March 2012 . Court: Adlene Hicheur . A nuclear scientist has gone on trial for allegedly plotting terror attacks with the North Africa wing of al Qaeda. Magistrates investigating the case . said the emails Adlene Hicheur exchanged with suspected Islamists 'crossed the line of simple debate of political or . religious ideas to enter the sphere of terrorist violence'. However his lawyers told the court that while their client had sent angry emails he never took any steps towards committing an attack. They said there is no proof of any terrorist intentions. Hicheur is accused of plotting an explosion that would have destroyed 'a city the size of London' and has gone on trial in Paris today. He is also alleged to have compiled a 'hit list' of VIP targets including French president Nicolas Sarkozy and his former interior minister Brice Hortefeux. The 35-year-old French-Algerian was arrested in a joint MI5 and French intelligence sting three years ago while researching the Big Bang theory at the CERN nuclear laboratory near Geneva. He denies the accusations and told the court that the investigation had been dishonest and imprecise. In one email to suspected Islamic terror chief Mustapha Debchi, Hicheur said he would 'propose possible objectives in Europe and particularly in France'. He wrote in March 2009: 'Concerning the matter of objectives, they differ depending on the different results sought after the hits. 'For example: if it's about punishing the state because of its military activities in Muslim countries - Afghanistan - then it should be a purely military objective. For example: the air base at Karan Jefrier near Annecy in France. This base trains troops and sends them to Afghanistan.' In June 2009, Debchi asked Hicheur: 'Don't beat around the bush: are you prepared to work in a unit becoming active in France?' Hicheur replied: 'Concerning your proposal, the answer is of course yes but there are a few observations. If your proposal relates to a precise strategy - such as working in the heart of the main enemy's house and emptying its blood of strength - then I should revise the plan that I've prepared.' Press: Hicheur's brother Halim at court . At CERN - the European Organisation for Nuclear Research - Hicheur worked on the Large Hadron Collider, a device designed to recreate the conditions of the Big Bang. In 2001 he worked at Stanford University in California and by 2005 had moved to the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire. Hicheur's lawyer now fears his trial for 'criminal association as part of a terrorist enterprise' could be jeopardised by the seven murders committed by Toulouse terrorist Mohamed Merah this month. Place of work: Hicheur worked at powerful LHC machine in Switzerland . Patrick Baudouin said: 'There is not the least proof against Mr Hicheur of any terrrorist intention. 'He has since the beginning been painted as the ideal guilty party. When the justice system gets going it finds it difficult to admit its mistakes. 'And with the murders in Toulouse this month committed by a suspected Islamic terrorist, this is not the ideal time to be holding his trial.' Hicheur, who denies the charge, faces ten years in prison if convicted.","Allegedly plotted to kill French president .

Subscribers to DirecTV will lose Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central and 14 other Viacom channels after the two companies failed to reach a new contract after wrangling over the cost of programming. They had been in talks over . a new contract - the previous one had been in place for the last seven . years - but could not agree on terms before the Tuesday midnight contract deadline. Both DirecTV Chief Executive Mike White and Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman addressed the standoff with reporters at Allen & Co's media and technology conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, yesterday. Jersey Shore: Cast who star on the hit MTV reality show - the channel is just one of more than a dozen which has been pulled . They offered vastly different views of why negotiations broke down. 'In the last seven years since we did the last DirecTV deal, we have successfully and peacefully concluded affiliate agreements with every major distributor in the U.S. We are prepared to move forward. It's unfortunate consumers for the first time are not able to enjoy our channels,' said Dauman, adding, 'I don't want to negotiate in public.' White, too, expressed sympathy for DirecTV's 20 million subscribers, but he laid the blame for the blackout at Viacom's feet. 'All we are trying to get is a fair deal for our customers and I'm sorry our customers are being forced into the middle of this,' White said. Pulled: Spongebob Square Pants will also no longer be on the list of shows subscribers can receive . 'We just think we pay a half a billion dollars a year and a billion dollar increase over five years, over 30 percent, is not justified by the marketplace or fair relative to our largest competitors or by their ratings.' White added that he spoke with Dauman at the conference on Wednesday. For its part, Viacom has said that its stable of networks account for about 20 percent of all viewing on DirecTV but currently less than 5 percent of its programming costs. The dispute sent shares of both companies lower on Wednesday. DirecTV shares ended down 1.1 percent, or 54 cents, at $48.15. Viacom's stock fell 0.3 percent, or 13 cents, to $46.73. A complete list of channels no longer available on DirecTV.    Nickelodeon (HD)    Comedy Central (HD)    MTV (HD)    BET (HD)    VH1 (HD)    CMT (HD)    Spike (HD)    Logo    TV Land    MTV2    VH1 Classic    Palladia    Nick Jr.    Nicktoons    TeenNick    Nickelodeon West    Tr3s    Centric    MTV India . The standoff is the latest between media companies and cable and satellite TV providers over the cost of content. These providers pay a fee to media companies that allows them to carry channels such as MTV. On July 1, AMC Networks, the company behind shows such as ""Breaking Bad,"" ""The Walking Dead"" and ""Mad Men,"" was removed from the Dish Network after the two companies failed to reach a new contract. Similar blackouts have taken place in recent years between Cablevision and Walt Disney Co's ABC; News Corp and Cablevision; and News Corp and Dish. In those cases and most others, a new contract was reached and the networks were restored within days. The purchase of television programs is the single biggest cost for distributors, who have fought back in recent years against what they consider unreasonable 'carriage fee' increases by content producers like Viacom. Companies such as Viacom tend to bundle their networks together, forcing distributors to carry lower-rated networks, such as Nick Jr., along with more popular channels such as MTV. This practice has triggered a debate in the industry about unbundling networks, which would allow customers to choose only the channels that they want to watch, a practice known in industry parlance as ""a la carte.' 'We've made it clear we would be happy to do an a la carte deal; I don't think that's likely, that decision is in the hands of Viacom,' White said. 'A lot of customers ask for a la carte absolutely, a lot of customers would really prefer to buy the channels they watch and not the others, but the contracts we are subject to by the media companies typically tie content together.' The possibility of DirecTV dropping Viacom's networks was raised in a mid-June note by Bernstein Research analyst Todd Juenger. Citing falling ratings at Nickelodeon and other Viacom networks, Juenger wrote, ""We believe it is no longer inconceivable that a distributor would drop Viacom, or at least engage in a public battle with them over price increases."" Despite declining ratings, Nickelodeon still ranks as the top-rated cable network in the country, based on total day viewers. Viacom took several aggressive steps to put pressure on DirecTV to reach a new deal. The company blocked access to its programming online so that DirecTV subscribers would not be able to view its programming on alternate platforms. It also created two videos that mocked DirecTV's position and its recent marketing campaign. This is not the first time a distributor has blacked out Viacom's channels due to a contract dispute. In 2004, Dish dropped some Viacom networks after the two sides failed to reach agreement on a new distribution deal. That blackout was short-lived, lasting less than 48 hours.","Shows such as SpongeBob and Jersey Shore will no longer be available to DirecTV subscribers .

Criminal cop: Jose Ramos, who was implicated as the mastermind behind the ticket-fixing scandal, allegedly tried to have the lead witness against him killed . The police officer who was the mastermind behind the New York City ticket-fixing scandal now faces charges of trying to hire a hit man so that he could have the lead witness against him killed. Jose Ramos was already in Rikers Jail- because of his two dozen prior charges- when the district attorney's office filed charges alleging that he helped his wife plan the hit while he was behind bars from September to May. At the indictment on Thursday, his wife Wanda Abreu began crying when she said she was not guilty of the three counts of conspiracy and lone count of criminal solicitation. Her husband also entered a not guilty plea for the same charges, but the prosecution feels that they have a strong case as they have been recording the couples' interactions. The murder-for-hire accusations can be added to his long list of alleged crimes including robbery, transporting heroin, and selling counterfeit DVDS, which all took place while he was in uniform. According to The New York Times, Ramos and Abreu would use up to five different codenames for the lead witness while plotting the hit during her visits to see Ramos in jail. At one point, he made it clear how vital the witness was to the ticket-fixing scandal by saying 'Without him there is no case. They need him.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Charged: Jose Ramos (left) was already in jail when he was charged with plotting, in conjunction with his wife Wanda Abreu (center right), t hire a hit man to kill a witness . The witness has not been publicly identified, nor has the hit man that Abreu planned to hire. 'They were willing to pay a fee, but it was crucial to them they not be involve in the murder,' assistant district attorney Omer Wiczyk said at the indictment. 'Ramos and Abreu have no problems having an individual murdered, they just did not want to get their hands dirty,' The Wall Street Journal reports Mr Wiczyk as saying. MSNBC News reports that Abreu suspected that their calls were being recorded and suggested that they stop the plan before she delivered the money. Making arrangements: Abreu (left) spoke to her husband using code names while they were planning the hit because she feared- correctly- that their phone calls were being recorded . Disgraced: Ramos was a 17-year veteran of the NYPD with a vast criminal rap sheet including drug transportation, robbery and insurance fraud . Ramos, 43, told her to stay the course, saying 'Go ahead, do it. But do it right away.' Abreu, 39, withdrew an undisclosed amount from Ramos' New York City Police Department pension. This is far from the beginning of the couples' criminal history, as Abreu was accused of insurance fraud in October at the same time that her husband was charged with 24 other crimes. At the time of the ticket-fixing scandal last fall, when he and 15 other officers were indicted for 'taking care of' parking tickets for their family and friends, he had already accrued quite a rapsheet. The New York Daily News . reports that in 2009 he took $10,000 to deliver what he believed to be . heroin to an undercover cop who was pretending to be a drug dealer. At . another point in his 17-year police career, he took $30,000 from a . different undercover cop who pretended to be interested in buying stolen . electronics. Arraigned: Bronx police officer Jose Ramos, left, seen in court in October during the ticket-fixing scandal . He stole a further $20,000 from a person buying drugs in a hotel room. And the final straw was when he was charged with buying heroin while on duty, in his uniform, driving his patrol car. Ramos is not ready to add conspiracy and criminal solicitation to the list, however, and his lawyer said they plan to fight the charges.Their second-degree conspiracy charges carry a standard sentence of 25-years in prison.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 08:17 EST, 16 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:17 EST, 16 July 2012 . A year after NASA ended the three-decade-long U.S. space shuttle program, thousands of formerly well-paid engineers and other workers around the Kennedy Space Center are still struggling to find jobs to replace the careers that flourished when shuttles blasted off from the Florida 'Space Coast'. Some have headed to South Carolina to build airplanes in that state's growing industry, and others have moved as far as Afghanistan to work as government contractors. Some found lower-paying jobs beneath their technical skills that allowed them to stay. Many are still looking for work and cutting back on things like driving and utilities to save money. Unemployed: Former space shuttle worker Terry White poses in front of a mock space shuttle at the Astronaut Hall of Fame in Titusville, Florida . 'Nobody wants to hire the old guy,' said Terry White, a 62-year-old former project manager who worked 33 years for the shuttle program until he was laid off after Atlantis landed last July 21. 'There just isn't a lot of work around here. Or if so, the wages are really small.' White earned more than $100,000 a year at the end of his career at the space center. The prospects of finding a job that pay anywhere near that along the Space Coast are slim. 'I could take an $11-an-hour job that is 40 miles away,' he said 'But with gas prices and all that, it's not really worthwhile.' More than 7,400 people, who once had labored on one of history's most complicated engineering achievements, lost their jobs when the shuttle program ended last July. While other shuttle workers in Houston, New Orleans and Huntsville, Alaska lost jobs, those areas had bigger economies to absorb the workers. In less economically diverse Brevard County, the mainly contractor positions cut by NASA accounted for just under 5 per cent of the county's private sectors jobs. Dead-end: Thousands of formerly well-paid engineers and other workers around the Kennedy Space Center (pictured) are still struggling to find jobs . The Kennedy Space Center's current . workforce of 8,500 workers is the smallest in more in than 35 years. In . the middle of the last decade, the space center employed around 15,000 . workers. James Peek, a . 48-year-old quality inspector for the shuttles, has applied for 50 . positions with no success since he was laid off in October 2010. He . has taken odd jobs glazing windows for a luxury hotel in Orlando and . working as a security guard. He has no health insurance and incurred a . $13,000 bill when he was hospitalized for three days last May. 'With most companies, it's like your application goes into a black hole,' Peek said. 'We're struggling to stay afloat.' Jobless . space workers have signed up for Brevard Workforce's job placement and . training services. Slightly more than half of the 5,700 workers the . agency has been able to track have found jobs, but more than a quarter . of those positions were outside Florida. Those jobs have been in the . fields of engineering, mechanics and security, according to the agency. Borrowed: NASA is relying on the Soviet-made Soyuz capsules to send U.S. astronauts to the international space station . Brevard County's unemployment rate spiked in the months that the shuttle program wound down, going from 10.6 per cent in April 2011 to 11.7 per cent in August 2011. It has since declined to 9 per cent, a result of a smaller workforce as many former shuttle workers either moved away or retired earlier than planned. Brevard County has added 2,700 jobs since the beginning of the year, but many are in the southern part of the 72-mile-long county where information technology giant Harris Corp. and airplane-maker Embraer are located. Jobless space workers in the northern part of the county jokingly refer to those high-tech workers as 'their rich cousins'. Some local employers are finding that the former space workers' salary demands are sometimes too high. 'STOP . sending former Space Center employees,' one employer wrote to Brevard . Workforce, the local job agency, in a comment included in its monthly . committee report. 'They have an unrealistic salary expectation.' Taxpayer . money allocated for job training programs for displaced space shuttle . workers also is dwindling a year after the program ended. Adding . to the difficulties of finding a new job is the age of many of the . former shuttle workers. Many spent their entire careers working on the . space shuttles and are now in their 50s and 60s. New roles: Many of the space workers are volunteering at Kennedy Space Center, giving tours to dignitaries and providing oral histories to tourists who stop by the Vehicle Assembly Building . In between sending out resumes and meeting at networking events, many of the space workers are volunteering at Kennedy Space Center, giving tours to dignitaries and providing oral histories to tourists who stop by the Vehicle Assembly Building. Even though many of the older space workers like White had years to plan for the end of the shuttle program, they stuck around, hoping to prepare the orbiters for displays in museums in Florida, Los Angeles and Washington after the program ended. They expected younger shuttle workers . to move over to the successor Constellation program whose goal was to . send astronauts to the moon and then Mars. But the cancellation of the . Constellation program in 2010 increased the competition for those few . jobs left prepping the shuttles. Some . shuttle workers, such as Kevin Harrington, had been holding out hope . that the program announced after Constellation's demise — a heavy-lift . rocket system that would launch astronauts in an Orion space capsule — . would offer immediate widespread job opportunities. But . the plans announced last year won't have unmanned test launches of the . Space Launch System for another five years, and the first manned mission . won't be for about another decade. Private-sector . companies, such as Paypal founder Elon Musk's Space X, are starting . unmanned launches from Kennedy Space Center, but their need for workers . doesn't come close to what was required for the shuttle program. Last time: The shuttle Endeavour is prepared for its 25th and final spaceflight after 19 years of service . 'We expected a little more action from our government, at least in figuring out what direction we're going to go in,' said Harrington, 55, who worked on the shuttles' thermal protection system earning about $80,000 a year. 'Ultimately, that would inform which direction we would go in. A lot of us thought, since we have such deep roots in the community, we could wait it out. It was hopeful at first. Now it isn't so hopeful. Things aren't moving fast.' Many of the former space workers find camaraderie and job tips each Friday at the weekly breakfast of the Spacecoast Technical Network, a group created by former Kennedy Space Center workers. Just hours before 70 members dined on eggs, biscuits and coffee at a recent meeting, three Chinese astronauts parachuted back to Earth in a capsule halfway around the world. For the space workers, it was yet another sign of the growing competition facing the United States as a leader of space exploration. At the moment, the United States has no way of sending astronauts to space in its own vehicles, and NASA is relying on the Soviet-made Soyuz capsules to send U.S. astronauts to the international space station. One of the network's founders, Bill Bender, recently joined more than two dozen other colleagues working on a reconnaissance project for a contractor in Afghanistan where they are earning six-figure annual incomes. Bender had been out of work for about a year from his job on the cancelled Constellation program when he took the one-year contract to work halfway around the world. New home: The Explorer, a full-size shuttle mockup that was on display at the Kennedy Space Center Visitors Complex for nearly two decades, stands ready for transport by barge to Houston, Texas . 'As the months passed, I began to realize the hard reality that things I had known and taken for granted no longer existed. Stable work, good pay, benefits, etc. were no longer a reasonable expectation,' Bender wrote in a recent email from Afghanistan. 'As time went by and it was getting closer to a year without a job ... the (Afghan) opportunity looked better and better. The money was very good due to compensation for hardship and danger.' Those who have remained on the Space Coast without jobs are cutting back on small luxuries. Harrington has trimmed back on eating out and vacations. Al Schmidt, who worked 27 years at the space center, has cut back on using his car and utilities at home to save money. The 60-year-old's unemployment benefits are running out soon, and without a new U.S. space program offering ready-to-go jobs, he is contemplating retirement, something he doesn't want to do. 'I live day to day. I can't afford new cars or lots of groceries,' Schmidt said. 'From where I sit, there is nothing coming online soon enough to resolve my problem.'","Kennedy Space Center's workforce of 8,500 is the smallest in more in than 35 years .

George Osborne is poised to scrap Labour’s controversial 50p tax  rate next week – despite Coalition infighting over the Budget that is set to go to the wire. David Cameron, Nick Clegg, the Chancellor and his Lib Dem deputy Danny Alexander again failed to settle the row yesterday over how to cut the tax on those earning more than £150,000 without appearing to favour the rich. A final meeting on Monday will be held  to thrash out a deal, just 48 hours before the Budget is delivered. 'Determined': George Osborne (right) wants to eliminate the 50p tax rate on those with incomes over £150,000 a year and will meet with Danny Alexander (left) on Monday . They have already missed last night’s deadline for handing over their plans for assessment by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, although sources insisted a way could be found round this. Labour yesterday branded the Budget preparations a ‘shambles’ and said the focus on the 50p rate suggested ministers were ‘completely out of touch’. But Mr Osborne is pressing to scrap the tax as a signal of his commitment to building an enterprise economy. He is expected to set out a timetable for reducing it before the next election, possibly to a rate of 45p. Insiders say he believes there is a brief ‘window of opportunity’ to ditch the tax before the election run-in. A Treasury-ordered review is expected to show the tax has raised just a few hundred million pounds in its first year, rather than the £2.5billion initially estimated. Quad: The budget discussions are being carried out by (from left to right) Danny Alexander, David Cameron, George Osborne and Nick Clegg . Tax take: The chart above shows how individuals tax bills rise with their income. The bottom line is on current tax bands, while the top is inflation-adjusted with late 1970s tax bands . Some Tories are furious with the Lib Dems over leaked reports claiming that the 50p rate would be slashed to 40p next week. The Chancellor is said to have ‘hit the roof’ over the leaks. Although Lib Dem sources seem resigned to an end to the 50p rate, they are demanding in return ‘concrete’ action to tax wealthy individuals. Proposals include a mansion tax on homes worth over £2million or a ‘tycoon tax’. David Ruffley, a Tory member of the Commons Treasury committee, said: ‘The Lib Dems’ megaphone diplomacy is deeply counter-productive. The 50p tax rate will ultimately cost this country dearly and should be scrapped immediately. ‘But there is little point cutting it if the Lib Dems are going to be allowed to slip in a brand new wealth tax.’ The Chancellor is also looking to underline his pro-business credentials by slashing the corporation tax rate. He announced plans last year to reduce it from 28p to 23p by 2014, and could lower it further to 20p. And he is considering a tax break to help develop Britain’s video game industry. The Liberal Democrats are demanding new taxes on the wealthy as 'compensation' for agreeing to axe the 50p tax band. Nick Clegg and Danny Alexander are anxious not to be seen to go soft on the rich and are demanding concessions from the Tories. An annual mansion tax could be imposed on properties worth more than £2million or there could be a new 'super' council tax band to hit the owners of the biggest properties. Alternatively, they could opt to cut pension relief for the wealthiest. Mansion tax - The idea to hit properties worth more than £2million with a new tax was first mooted in the 2010 Liberal Democrat manifesto. Under the proposals, mansion owners will face a new annual tax bill equal to 1 per cent of the value of their property. However, it is unlikely to be brought in because the proposals have met fierce opposition from the Tories. Such a tax would also be very expensive to administer as all property values would have to be assessed. New council tax band - The owners of the largest homes could be forced to pay a new 'super' council tax rate. The value of properties in England was last assessed for council tax purposes in 1993. It is hard to see how a new band could be imposed without re-assessing the value of all homes. The Tories ruled out carrying out such an exercise in September 2010 - and if they performed a U-turn the cost would likely run into billions of pounds. Clamp down on pension tax relief - Billions could be saved by scrapping tax relief currently given on pension contributions by people who pay income tax at the higher rates of 40 per cent and 50 per cent. Currently, staff paying into an occupational pension have amounts taken by their employers before tax is deducted, enabling them to get full relief straight away, depending on what income tax band they are in. Those making contributions into a private pension get immediate tax relief from the Government at 20 per cent, the basic level of income tax. Higher-rate taxpayers can then claim the difference through their tax returns or by contacting HMRC. Lib Dems have proposed halving the tax relief for those paying 40 per cent income tax, a move that would hit millions of middle earners including higher-paid teachers and nurses. Mr Osborne is unlikely to agree to go that far, but reducing the tax relief for those earning more than £150,000 a year, and therefore enjoying 50 per cent relief, would be more palatable to Tories. That would affect the 320,000 top earners in the country.","Chancellor 'determined' to slash top rate next week .

Tragic: War hero William Davis, 92, who was believed to have served in the Navy, was found dead at a house in Willenhall, West Midlands . A woman who used to take meals round to a decorated war veteran found battered to death at his home has been arrested on suspicion of his murder. Mother-of-three Charlotte  Doody, 35, who lived opposite 92-year-old William Davis, was last night being questioned over the killing of the ‘fiercely independent’ pensioner. Neighbours said the builder’s wife was among several residents of Hobley Street who used to keep an eye out for the widower. Mr Davis, who was known as Bill and had a collection of medals from serving with the Royal Navy in the Second World War, was found in his heavily bloodstained terraced house in  Willenhall, West Midlands, on Sunday. Detectives have revealed the great grandfather was seen alive at around 3pm when a neighbour took him round some dinner. Some time over the next three hours he was viciously beaten about the head with a blunt instrument before his killer fled. Mrs Doody and her husband Michael, who runs a building firm, have three children. On Tuesday, one of them wrote on Facebook: ‘OMG poor poor bill I will always miss u and I love  you xxx you was like a granddad to me.’ When asked by a friend ‘have u got questoined (sic) yet?’, she replied: ‘Nah mum as (sic).’ Neighbours said Mrs Doody was among several in the community always willing to help Mr Davis. The woman, named locally as Charlotte Doody, was arrested at her home, just yards from where the frail widower was found collapsed in a pool of blood. He died as a result of severe head injuries, West Midlands Police said. Mrs Doody was being questioned by police, as forensic teams scoured her property. She would regularly deliver meals to the pensioner who walked with the aid of a zimmer frame, according to neighbours. Neighbour Jaga Sehmbi, 56, said of Mr Davis: ‘Everyone knew him. I would see him walking down the road taking small steps. ‘I would stop and talk to him for half an hour. He had so much knowledge, especially about the local area. ‘The community is devastated, it’s shocking. You could never think anyone would harm such a lovely old bloke.’ At a press conference held by the force yesterday, Detective Superintendent Richard Baker described Mr Davis as a fiercely independent decorated war veteran who was father to two, grandfather to four and a great-grandfather to one.

'We know he was seen at 9am on Sunday April 1 in his front garden, where he stopped and chatted to passers-by. 'At around 3.15pm a neighbour took . some lunch round to his house. At 6pm concerned neighbours who were . unable to rouse Bill gained access to his property and found him.' Step by step: Police search Hobley Street, Willenhall, West Midlands, following the suspected murder of William Davis . The house remains sealed off and forensic searches are continuing. Mr Baker appealed for anyone who might have been in the Fisher Street and Hobley Street area on Sunday to come forward. Mr Davis, who worked as a locksmith . after leaving the Navy and was known as Bill, lost his wife Clara in . 2006, three years after they marked their diamond wedding anniversary. The couple had a son and a daughter as . well as several grandchildren and one great-grandchild, who neighbours . said visited regularly. Paramedics were called to the house . where he had lived alone early on Sunday evening after the alarm was . raised, but Mr Davis was pronounced dead at the scene. Mr Baker on Sunday described the scene . where Mr Davis was killed as 'heavily bloodstained.' He said: 'There's . an item that was found at the scene next to Mr Davis' body. 'It has been submitted for forensic examination. It's my belief that another item was used in the attack on Mr Davis. 'The type of item used could have been taken from the home address or could have been brought to the address. 'He died from multiple head injuries, . some of which we believe were caused by a blunt instrument. It appears . that when paramedics first arrived there was a light pulse but he died . shortly afterwards.' Police confirmed there was no sign of a . forced break in at Mr Davis' home and nothing was stolen. Mr Baker . added: 'It appears to be a very violent attack. Officers were called to the scene at around 6.30pm on Sunday evening . 'The motive is still unexplained but . there doesn't appear to be any sign of forced entry or any sign of a . search within the address. There's also no indication of anything being . stolen. 'It's highly likely that the person or persons responsible for this may have left the address heavily blood stained.' He also pointed out that anyone responsible would have left the address heavily blood-stained. Neighbours spoke of their shock at the savage killing. An employee at the local newsagent . said Mr Davis had been going there to buy his paper every day for 60 . years until difficulty walking meant he couldn’t manage it any more. ‘He would say hello to everybody in . the street, he was a really kind bloke,’ he said. ‘You would look at him . and think “He’s not 90, he’s about 70”. ‘The amount of stories he’s told me and the medals he has shown me – it was unreal. ‘What happened yesterday was a proper shock. It’s absolutely tragic. ‘We heard that somebody had broken in . and stabbed him after he tried to challenge them but the police are not . telling us anything.’ Pamela Griffin, 72, who lived opposite . Mr Davis for more than 20 years, said: ‘William was a lovely man, very . kind and generous and would talk to anyone. He would always talk about . his time in the Navy. He was very proud of his war medals. ‘I last saw him on Saturday afternoon. He was pottering in his front garden and looked happy and cheerful.’ Police have refused to say how Mr Davis died or whether there were any . signs of a break-in at his home. They described him as a ‘very . well-regarded, nice elderly gentleman’. Mr Davis is believed to have served during World War Two and been awarded several medals. Today Mr Baker appealed for anyone who . knows a friend, neighbour or associate who had blood-stained clothing . and was either trying to conceal them or wash them to come forward.","Married 35-year-old arrested at her home just yards from the brutal scene of war hero's death .

Passengers face travel chaos at Stansted Airport over the Easter bank holiday as baggage handlers prepare to strike over pay, the GMB union announced today. The move follows an overwhelming vote in favour of industrial action by 150 union members employed by Swissport. The union has claimed that shift changes would lead to wage cuts of up to £1,000. Taking action: Stansted Airport is likely to be left in chaos over a hugely busy period as workers plan to walk out . The GMB said strikes will be held on Good Friday, Easter Saturday and Easter Monday, threatening disruption to passengers flying on holiday for the holiday break. GMB official Gary Pearce said: 'GMB members have voted overwhelmingly for strike action and for action short of a strike. 'Up to now the company has been intent on imposing these changes without agreement and this is completely unacceptable, as this vote shows. 'GMB has offered several alternative shift patterns and working arrangements but the company refuses to listen so far. 'I have notified Swissport of the ballot result and I have asked them for more talks to try to avert action over these pay cuts. 'GMB members consider that Swissport is attempting to make savings at their expense and they are not willing to agree to this. Logistics: A spokesman for the airport said Swissport predominately handle baggage for Ryanair . 'Unless there is urgent talks and a settlement, this vote for action this will result in disruption over the Easter Bank Holiday weekend. 'The travelling public need to be aware that it has been this aggressive move by Swissport to cut our members pay at a time of high inflation that has led to this strike vote. 'If the strike goes ahead, Swissport is entirely to blame for the disruption.' Stansted normally has more than 200,000 people travelling in and out of the airport to European destinations over the Easter weekend. A spokesman for the airport said Swissport predominately handle Ryanair, who encourage passengers to bring carry-on luggage, so the company does not anticipate a major problem.

Victim: WPC Yvonne Fletcher was gunned down while on duty outside the Libyan Embassy in London in 1984 . A new suspect has been named in the killing of WPC Yvonne Fletcher who was gunned down outside the Libyan Embassy in London 28 years ago. Pro-Gaddafi student Salah Eddin Khalifa was the man behind the fatal shot, according to a senior aide to Libya's prime minister. He is living in a North African city where he fled as Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's regime crumbled and could now be questioned about the shooting. WPC Fletcher, who was 25, was killed by a . single bullet that hit her in the abdomen which was fired from the embassy during a demonstration in St James's Square in April 1984. Ten dissidents were injured . as automatic gunfire was sprayed from a first-floor window of the . building. An 11-day . armed police siege followed which ended with 30 Libyan nationals being deported. Ashur Shamis -  a London-based . opposition leader at the time - was at the demonstration when WPC Fletcher was . shot and claimed Mr Khalifa has been named as the suspect by several . sources in the former regime. He alleged Mr Khalifa left the embassy by a back door just minutes later and before the building was surrounded by police. Mr Khalifa was a part of a student  'revolutionary committee' loyal to Gaddafi  and did not have diplomatic status. On his return to Libya he was promoted to a lucrative post as head of the country's High Institute for Electronics. Mr Shamis told the Sunday Telegraph it was 'mind boggling' that Britain had done so little to pursue the case almost a year after the overthrow of . Colonel Gaddafi. He added: 'It is time to do something about this. It is mind-boggling that the British . authorities have done nothing. If they had taken it seriously, they . could have solved it by now. Tribute: A guard of honour of police officers as Yvonne Fletcher's body travels to Salisbury Cathedral for a funeral service . 'People involved with the regime have confirmed the name to me. People in [regime] security who are now part of the revolution have confirmed the name. I keep hearing this name again and again.' The transitional government has access to a number of regime prisoners and defectors with knowledge of the incident. British diplomats denied dragging its feet over the investigation. Last month Metropolitan Police officers visited Libya for preliminary discussions about pursuing the case. A spokesman for the British embassy in Tripoli said: 'The embassy is in close contact with the Libyan authorities to follow up on this visit.' And a Foreign Office source told the Telegraph: 'Nobody should decry the energy and assiduousness with which the British government and the Metropolitan Police are seeking a solution to the murder of one of their police officers.' In memory: Libyan Prime Minister Abdelrahim al-Kib lays a wreath at the memorial to WPC Fletcher outside the Libyan Embassy last May . According to sources, the Libyan Government were reported to be ready to announce significant developments as early as this week. Mr Shamis said his contacts within the Gaddafi regime had given him the name of the alleged killer before last year’s revolution and he had since been able to confirm it in government. He said he had given Mr Khalifa’s name to British police but had 'heard nothing' from them. Abdulmajid Biuk, a member of a commission responsible for removing Gaddafi officials from state institutions, separately named Mr Khalifa to the newspaper. Mohammed al-Alaghi, who served as justice minister for the first four months after the overthrow of Gaddafi, said Mr Khalifa was in the 'operation room' of the regime. In April, Ali Hamiada Ashour, the current . justice minister, criticised Britain’s 'delay' in sending officers, . adding that they were 'ready to give any help necessary' and 'this could . start now as far as we are concerned.' At the family’s home town of Sabratha, west of Tripoli, Mr Khalifa’s brother, Abdulrazzak, confirmed that he was alive and out of the country, but refused to answer further questions. A previous suspect named was Abdulmagid Salah Ameri, a junior Libyan diplomat, now thought to be dead. A Scotland Yard spokesman refused to comment on whether Mr Khalifa’s name had been passed to them.","He names suspect and accuses Britain of dragging its feet over probe .

England and Ireland football supporters have been warned to ‘watch their tackle’ in this summer’s Euros because of a deadly biting insect that attacks the groin. The tournament is being held in the Ukraine and Poland where there is a particular danger of the potentially fatal viral disease Tick Borne Encephalitis (TBE) experts warn. Warning: Ticks infected with encephalitis target the warmest parts of the body . One of the worst affected regions is Silesia, which contains Krakow - the base for the England team. Fans most at risk are those who will be camping in the countryside as thousands are intending to do in order to avoid paying the spiralling hotel charges in cities. Ticks infected with the disease thrive in such areas and they often bite the warmest parts of the body which doctors say are the groin or the armpit. This means nipping behind a tree in the countryside for a call of nature could be exposing themselves to the risk of a bite. The warning comes from UK charity Tick Alert which has set up a special page on its website Tickalert.org dedicated to football supporters heading to the event. It lists the level of risk in the regions where many of the games are being played and shows that part of Europe is described as ‘highly endemic’. Up to 13,000 people a year in Europe . need hospital treatment for an infected tick bite, a third of whom go on . to contract meningitis. This, in turn, leads to encephalitis, a swelling of the brain and spinal cord. Only . two per cent of cases end fatally yet those who recover can suffer for . years from symptoms such as exhaustion and loss of memory, said Tick . Alert. Fans: Football fans who will be camping ahead of the England matches in Poland have been told to take particular care . A spokesman said: 'Our message to travelling fans is ""watch your tackle"". 'Ticks lie in wait and crawl unnoticed to a nice warm spot on your body, usually the groin although the armpit is another favourite feeding place. 'Underwear offers little protection against these blood-sucking pests. 'People spending time in the countryside, especially if they are sleeping or walking a lot in grassy areas and undergrowth, need to regularly check their body for ticks. 'Remove any immediately as the moment the tick bites there is the risk you will contract TBE.' The Foreign Office has warned travellers going to TBE-endemic countries seek medical advice from the local clinic before they go. Among countries affected are almost all in central and eastern Europe but also those in Scandanavia and as far south as Greece. Infected ticks are found in rural and forest areas from late spring and throughout the summer.",Tick-Borne Encephalitis is a viral infectious disease that causes swelling of the brain and spinal cord .

Warning: French President Nicolas Sarkozy has threatened to bring back passports checks for all EU citizens unless other countries take tougher measures against illegal immigrants . Nicolas Sarkozy has threatened to bring back passport checks for all EU citizens entering France if member countries fail to seal their borders against illegal immigrants. The French president named Greece as a key culprit allowing asylum seekers to flood across its ‘unguarded frontier’ with Turkey. He set a one-year deadline for EU nations to tighten security before France pulls out of the Schengen Agreement that allows free travel between 25 countries. He said yesterday: ‘There are 120km between Greece and Turkey which are not guarded. ‘I am within my rights to demand what the sanctions should be. I give one year for this practice to change, otherwise we suspend our membership of the Schengen Agreement. ‘As it is France which has the most generous welfare benefits, we are the ones most affected by putting these measures into place properly.’ Mr Sarkozy’s increasingly tough stance on immigration is seen as an attempt to win over voters of the extremist National Front party as he falls behind socialist rival Francois Hollande in the polls for this month’s presidential election. His remarks come a month after he said tightening border security was the only way to avoid ‘the implosion of Europe’. Mr Sarkozy told an election rally in March: ‘Unchecked immigration thwarts Europe’s ability to take in and integrate new entrants and puts strains on social safety nets for the most disadvantaged across the continent.’ Right of passage: German police officers wave EU flags after the border station with the Czech Republic is closed in 2007 following the Schengen agreement, which allows free travel between 25 countries . The UK did not sign up to the Schengen Agreement and Britons still need a passport to visit France.

Hazel Lebby, 37, says she was shocked to discover her daughter Hannah had twice been denied a lunch and has now threatened to take her child out of the school. St Thomas’s School in Mitcham, Wimbledon, said it needed to take drastic action after parents racked up £1,730 in unpaid dinner meals last year. Furious: Hazel Lebby, 37, was shocked to discover her daughter Hannah, 6, was given bread and jam instead of a hot school dinner for two days . Mrs Lebby said: 'I was supposed to pay it on Monday but my car broke down so I totally forgot about having to sort it out. 'Then the next morning I woke up with a leak. My carpet was soaking wet. I managed to get her to school on time but had to come back home and sort out the leak. 'I would never in a million years think they would refuse a child dinner because I’m a couple of days late. No one had made an attempt to phone me and tell me my daughter had not been having a dinner. 'The only reason I found out was because my daughter let it out.' Mrs Lebby, from Mitcham, works for the catering company that provides the school’s dinners at another school. She received a text from the school to say that because she was in arrears by £4 there 'may not' be a school lunch for her child today. Big bill: St Thomas's School in Mitcham, Wimbledon, said it needed to take drastic action after parents racked up £1,730 in unpaid dinner meals last year . Her daughter was given a substitute of two slices of bread and jam for two days. She has since made an official complaint to Merton Council and has said she does not want her daughter to return to the school. She said: 'I personally feel if they can make a child feel like that then I really don’t want her to go there at all. 'You don’t take it out on a child. All they had to do was pick up the phone and say we have noticed you are in arrears and your child will not be getting a dinner. I would have picked her up or brought down some lunch.' But the school has defended the decision and the need to take drastic action following the large bill which was racked up on unpaid dinner meals last year. Headteacher David Feasey said: 'We are liable for those arrears and if parents don’t pay we have to foot the bill and it’s taking money away from resources we could be spending on the children. 'Sometimes people experience difficulties and we can work around that.' However, he did say he would 'look into' the wording of the text message to make it clear to parents whether their child would be refused a school lunch. He added: 'It’s a parent’s responsibility to make sure their child is fed, not the schools.

A father has been jailed for beating his mentally ill wife to death with a flashlight after she strangled their son and tried to kill their daughter. Christopher Smeltzer, 39, of New Hampshire, was jailed for up to 30 years after pleading guilty to killing Mara Pappalardo in November 2010. She was paranoid, obsessed with death and convinced her husband and mother-in-law were plotting to take her children away, a court heard. Sentenced: Christopher Smeltzer, 39, has been jailed for beating his mentally ill wife Mara Pappalardo to death after she killed Mason and tried to kill Mercey . Pappalardo was hospitalised for mental illness before she strangled their four-year-old son with a ribbon and tried to kill their seven-year-old girl. Smeltzer’s charge was changed from second-degree manslaughter to manslaughter by provocation because of a horrific scene he encountered. He found his son strangled, his daughter dangling off a bed with a scarf around her neck and his wife trying to commit suicide, prosecutors said. ‘As soon as I saw my son I knew something was very wrong,’ Smeltzer said. ‘I knew he was dead and I lost all control. Enraged, I struck my wife. ‘I did something that was not going to bring my son back,’ adding that he wished he had a ‘rewind button’ to go back and change what he did. Smeltzer believed his daughter was dead as well and toxicology tests confirmed he took a large quantity of pills in an effort to take his own life. Deaths: Smeltzer's charge was changed from second-degree manslaughter to manslaughter by provocation because of a horrific scene he encountered . His daughter Mercey awakened him the next morning and asked if her mother and brother were still breathing, prosecutors said. 'As soon as I saw my son I knew something was very wrong.

There was tension between members of . Smeltzer's family and his wife's.

Pappalardo’s cousin Adam Roz faulted Smeltzer for leaving his wife alone with the children and said he failed as a father, husband and human being. 'Mercey is an innocent victim of Chris's actions as well as Mara's' John Newman . ‘In my heart, I feel anyone sitting here today should have, could have, but just plain didn't act,’ Mr Roz said. ‘For that, we're all guilty of this tragedy.’ Pappaladro's sisters spoke of her passion for nature and reading and dreams of writing children's books. ‘She believed in God, the saints, the power of prayer and love and even in magic,’ her sister, Mona Harris, said. Judge Tina Nadeau questioned whether the outcome would have been the same had Smeltzer not used drugs that night. 'In my heart, I feel anyone sitting here today should have, could have, but just plain didn't act. For that, we're all guilty of this tragedy' Adam Roz . But she acknowledged that he must have had an extreme emotional reaction to what greeted him when he came home. She said nothing she could do or say would lessen the grief for the families and imposed the sentence the state requested. It included a provision that five years will be suspended if he earns his college degree and takes anger management classes. With the suspension and credit for time served since his arrest, he could be free in nine years. Mercey now lives with one of her mother's sisters.","Christopher Smeltzer returned home to horrific scene .

The NHS could save £85million each year by using a cheaper drug to treat a common form of blindness in the elderly, researchers claim. They have found that Avastin, a drug used to treat cancer, is just as effective against age-related macular degeneration as Lucentis, which is 12 times more expensive. Effective: New cost effective use of Avastin has been found, but is far cheaper . Around 23,000 patients a year develop the more serious ‘wet’ form of AMD, and nearly three quarters go on to suffer severe sight problems. At present they are normally prescribed Lucentis injections, which cost £750 and are given every six weeks. But a number of doctors have started using Avastin, which costs £60 a time and is administered as frequently. As a result a team of researchers from universities including Oxford, Belfast, Southampton and Bristol carried out a trial on 610 patients to investigate whether it really was as effective. The study’s initial results showed that both drugs produced almost equal benefit. Finding: The £60 treatment could replace the £750 treatment to tackle AMD which robs sufferers of their central vision . But the researchers calculated that switching patients to the cheaper Avastin could save the NHS £84.5million a year, based on 17,295 eyes being treated. AMD is caused by the deterioration and death of the cells in the macula, the part of the retina used to see straight ahead, and so robs sufferers of their central vision. The more common ‘dry’ form affects the eyes gradually. But one in seven of these will develop the more serious ‘wet’ form and lose their central vision almost immediately. Avastin, made by Roche, is not currently licensed to treat wet AMD but last year several NHS trusts began using it, as  long as it had been recommended by specialist doctors. Novartis is the drugs giant behind Lucentis . Last month it emerged that Novartis, the drugs giant behind Lucentis, was taking these four trusts to court, claiming they were putting patients at risk. Experts accused the firm of trying to maximise its profits by blocking the cheaper drug. Professor Usha Chakravarthy of Queen’s University Belfast, who led the latest research, said: ‘The results at the end of the first year show that Lucentis and Avastin have similar effectiveness.’ She said both groups of patients  were able to read one or more lines of letters lower down – which are smaller and harder to see – on a standard  sight test. Novartis argues that Avastin is not as safe as Lucentis and claims that patients are at higher risk of stomach and gut disorders. But overall, researchers say both drugs are extremely safe. The study noted, however, that patients on Lucentis were at a slightly higher risk  of heart attack and stroke, while those on Avastin were marginally more likely  to need hospital treatment for  other problems. A spokesman for the Macular Disease Society said: ‘The trials cannot provide definitive safety information and the overall question of the safety of Avastin is, unfortunately, not answered to everyone’s satisfaction by these trials. ‘The use of Avastin will remain a matter of judgment for clinicians, with some satisfied with the evidence and others not.’","Current drug costs £750 per treatment, but doctors are increasingly using a £60 alternative .

Teachers who make excuses and complain about their jobs 'do not know what stress is', the controversial chief inspector of Ofsted claimed today. Tough-talking Sir Michael Wilshaw, who this week demanded a crackdown on classroom ill-discipline, said England does not need school leaders whose first instinct is to blame others for failure, but those that are willing to tackle under-performance. Sir Michael said that as heads have more power, pay and freedom than ever before, they should recognise the 'privileged' position they are in. Scathing attack: Sir Michael, the chief inspector of Ofsted, has promised to launch a crackdown on classroom ill-discipline . The Ofsted chief inspector also vowed to press ahead with his proposals to raise school standards in the face of widespread criticism from headteachers. He told a conference at Brighton College this morning that in the past, headteachers who were not prepared to tackle poor teaching were not challenged. Sir Michael said: 'We need to learn from this and challenge those who have power invested in them to make the difference, but too often make excuses for poor performance - it’s just too hard, the children are too difficult, the families are too unsupportive, this job is far too stressful,' Sir Michael said. 'Let me tell you what stress is. 'Stress is what my father felt, who struggled to find a job in the 1950s and 1960s and who often had to work long hours in three different jobs and at weekends to support a growing family. 'Stress is, I’m sure, what many of the million and a half unemployed young people today feel - unable to get a job because they’ve had a poor experience of school and lack the necessary skills and qualifications to find employment. 'Stress is what I was under when I started as a head in 1985, in the context of widespread industrial action - teachers walking out of class at a moment’s notice - doing lunch duty on my own every day for three years because of colleagues who worked to rule - covering five classes in the sports hall when there was no-one to teach them. Criticism: Sir Michael said most teachers do not know what real stress really is . 'Stress was, in the days before local management of schools, writing letters in triplicate to the local authority asking for a brick wall to be built in the playground or for a bit of extra money to keep an excellent maths teacher - and not receiving a reply for weeks. 'I still bear the scars of those days.' The Ofsted chief's no-nonsense comments came just days after he told the Daily Mail that mobile phones should be banned in schools, and teachers marked down if they don't enforced the ban. His tough new inspection regime also promises to tackle back-chatting and calling out in classrooms. Sir Michael said that times have changed, and that heads are now in charge, with better pay and more independence, power and resources than before. 'We need heads who know what a privileged position they are in now and who can use their new-found independence well - people who roll up their sleeves and get on with improving their schools, even in the most difficult circumstances. 'What we don’t need are leaders in our schools whose first recourse is to blame someone else - whether it’s Ofsted, the local education authority, the government or a whole host of other people.' Defence: Michael Gove has described criticism aimed at Sir Michael Wilshaw as 'misdirected' Sir Michael told the conference that the bar on school standards must be raised. 'We must hold our nerve,' he said. 'I am determined to do so as chief inspector, and not panic at the first whiff of grapeshot, some of which has whistled past my ears over the last few days.' Earlier this week Sir Michael was accused of using 'bully-boy tactics' by heads at the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) annual conference. The union passed an emergency motion which said they were 'saddened and dismayed' by his approach. The move represented a further deterioration of relations between the union and Ofsted, and came just days after the NAHT raised concerns over the variable quality of inspections and the watchdog’s planned changes to the inspection system. Proposing the motion, Mike Curtis, an Oxfordshire headteacher, had told the NAHT’s conference: 'Fear reigns and confidence wanes as Ofsted waves its stick!' It is time to stand up to 'bully-boy tactics', he added. Education Secretary Michael Gove backed the Ofsted chief in his speech to Brighton College today, telling delegates: 'There’s been some criticism recently of the new inspections framework and the new chief inspector. 'I’ve listened to that criticism - I’ve considered carefully the arguments made - and I have to say on reflection - it’s misdirected at best, mischievous at worst. 'Sir Michael Wilshaw is a visionary school leader who has spent his career in the state sector and has achieved amazing results for children from the poorest homes - when his critics achieve results like him, then I’ll believe their arguments carry the same weight as his experience. 'He is determined to improve inspection, drive up standards, encourage great teaching and celebrate good leadership - he deserves the backing of everyone who wants children to succeed - and I shall do everything to ensure that whatever he wants - he gets.'","Sir Michael Wilshaw hits out at teachers who complain about their work .

Behind bars: Adam Khan Ahmadzai was at the very heart of the looting and rioting in Croydon last August, according to the Attorney General . A riot ringleader who was at the heart of last year’s Croydon disorder had his sentence of four years detention nearly doubled today because it was too lenient. Adam Khan Ahmadzai, 20, attacked police, robbed, pillaged and looted during a shocking orgy of ‘mayhem and carnage’ during last August’s mass disorder. He was given 48 months in a young offender institution when he appeared at Inner London Crown Court in January. But Attorney General Dominic Grieve . referred the case to the Court of Appeal on the basis that the total . sentence imposed for offences of violent disorder, robbery, burglary and . criminal damage on the evening of August 8, 2011 was unduly lenient. Today, . the Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge, sitting with Mr Justice Openshaw and . Mr Justice Irwin, agreed and said it should be increased to seven . years. Lord Judge said: ‘These were offences of great seriousness.’ The . Attorney General, who presented the case to the court, said later: . ‘Adam Khan Ahmadzai was at the very heart of the looting and rioting in . Croydon last August. ‘Consider . the extraordinary list of crimes that he committed: he led an attack on . a police line; robbed a bus driver who he had forced to halt; armed . himself and ransacked a shop, forcing the petrified owners to flee, only . to rob them moments later in a hijack of their van; repeatedly attacked . and mugged a terrified man at a cash machine, acting as if pushing a . gun into his neck; led a gang into a supermarket, looting and . vandalising; and finally directed his group into a betting shop, . destroying a fruit machine and looting the office behind the counter. Lives at risk: Images from the rioting in Croydon became iconic of the mass violence and crime committed across London . 'Mayhem and carnage': Adam Khan Ahmadzai, 20, led an attack on a police line; robbed a bus driver who he had forced to halt; armed himself and ransacked a shop during an orgy of criminality which left Croydon devastated . ‘For this catalogue of mayhem and . carnage he received a four-year sentence. I’m very pleased that the . Court of Appeal has today quashed that sentence and replaced it with one . of seven years.’ CPS London . chief crown prosecutor Alison Saunders said: ‘We referred this case to . the Attorney General as one that had attracted a sentence which was . unduly lenient. 'Unduly lenient': Attorney General Dominic Grieve QC took action to increase Ahmadzai's sentence because it was too lenient . ‘I welcome the strong message that the Court of Appeal has now sent out as a result of this ruling. ‘Adam . Khan Ahmadzai was a ringleader during the riots in Croydon and his . conviction for 10 offences committed that night shows the extent of his . criminality. ‘His offences . were amongst the most serious which CPS London has prosecuted in . relation to the summer riots and this increased sentence reflects that.’ Ahmadzai, . of Feltham, west London, buried his head in his hands as he sat in the . dock of the court while Lord Judge recounted the ordeal of a convenience . shop owner, who was beaten up in front of his wife and and saw his . business ransacked. When the couple tried to escape in their van, they were both pulled out of the vehicle and a knife was held to his stomach. Lord . Judge said the man had moved into Croydon to make a fresh start and . build a new life in the community, and that was beginning to happen . before the riots. But what . had happened had affected him more than he ever thought possible, so he . had pulled out of the business and was now unemployed and in great . financial difficulty. This offence on its own was of the ‘greatest possible seriousness’, he added. Ahmadzai, who used a brick, a wooden and a . metal pole, a hammer and a waste bin as weapons, had pleaded guilty in . the context of his identification on CCTV footage and from blood found . on the cash machine. Wrecked: Croydon saw some of the fiercest violence and disorder during the London riots, with an entire row of shops and buildings on London Road, Croydon, gutted after widespread looting and arson . The judges went on to dismiss an . appeal against a five-and-a- half-year prison sentence imposed on . 23-year-old Zac Challinor for offences of arson, burglary and violent . disorder in the riots in Manchester on August 9 last year.

Suing: Romilda Aparecida Ferreira says she needs money to cover the her medical expenses and make up for the time at work she missed . A Brazilian prostitute who says she was thrown out of a US Embassy car by three Marines and run over is suing the American government, it emerged Thursday. The US State Department is fighting back now, saying Romilda Aparecida Ferreira was not pushed, but was instead hit when she tried to get inside the vehicle and the driver sped away. The lawsuit Miss Ferreira, 31, is promising is just the latest South American sex worker scandal to embarrass government employees working overseas. Earlier this month, 24 Secret Service . agents and military servicemen were suspended after they allegedly . partied with Colombian prostitutes ahead of President Barack Obama's . visit to the country. It . was also revealed Secret Service agents in El Salvador allegedly . partied with strippers and took hookers back to their hotel before . Obama's visit there in 2011. Miss . Ferreira was left with a broken collar bone, two broken ribs and a . punctured lung after the incident in Brazil's capital Brasilia in . November. The three Marines . on a US Embassy security team, and an Embassy staff member, were pulled . out of the country before police were able to press charges, according . to Brazil's Jornal Nacional programme. The US government says it tracked Miss Ferreira down and paid her medical expenses. However, she says she was offered just $2,100 -- never nearly enough to cover the cost of surgeries and 12 days in the hospital. It cost more than $9,500 for just the operation to fix her collarbone, which was botched. In her lawsuit, she is seeking money for her injuries, medical expenses, lost income, and psychological trauma. According to a Brazilian police . investigation, the four US Embassy officials had visited a nightclub . in the centre of Brasilia where they had hired a group of prostitutes. One of the Americans and at least one . woman left the club by taxi, but Miss Ferreira and another women got into . an official US Embassy van with the other three men. As . they pulled away there was a discussion about how much the women were . to be paid, and one of the Marines pushed Miss Ferreira out of the car, . where she ended up being run over by the vehicle. Scarred: Miss Ferreira shows the cut she received after she was allegedly pushed out of a US Embassy van and run over in the parking lot of a nightclub . Pittance: Miss Ferreira says US officials offered her just $2,100 for her injuries, but her 12-day hospital stay and surgery cost much more . Speaking to the Jornal Nacional news programme, Romilda said she tried to hold on to the door but was dragged under the wheels. She said: 'I tried to get up and . grabbed the doorknob. That was when they told the driver to go. Then I . felt my leg burning. I let go and fell underneath the van. I hit my head . and passed out.' The Americans then allegedly drove away without offering assistance. But a State Department account of the events contradicts key parts of Miss Ferreira's story. The department said Miss Ferreira tried to open a door and climb into the moving car. Spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the woman fell and was injured. She said no charges were filed against the four Americans but all have left Brazil. Wanted: Brazilian police wanted to charge the American personnel involved in hitting Miss Ferreira, but they were removed to the country and sent back to the US . The incident came to light after US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta was questioned about it by a Brazilian reporter during a press conference . A defense official said Tuesday there were two women with the Marines outside of the club and that it appeared one of women started a fight inside the car. She was removed from the vehicle and fell when she tried to get back in, according to the official. A second official said the woman broke her collarbone when she was pushed from the car. This incident came to light after US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, in Brazil during a Latin American tour, was questioned about it by a Brazilian reporter during a press conference. Police . investigating the incident requested the arrest of the driver of the . van and one of the Marines for bodily injury and failure to rescue. But US authorities removed the four men from the country before they could be charged with the crimes. Centre of scandal: Sex worker Dania Suarez, 24, claimed she made a scene when a Secret Service agent in Colombia did not give her enough money . Embarrassment: U.S. President Barack Obama, pictured walking across the South Lawn of the White House, is now facing two scandals over the conduct of his staff abroad . Speaking to reporters in Brasilia, Mr Panetta said the men were pulled from the country, two of the Marines had their ranks reduced and the embassy staff member was removed from his post. He added that the embassy had tracked Miss Ferreira down and paid for her medical expenses. He added: 'This incident was fully investigated and all those involved were punished. They are no longer in this country. This type of behaviour is unacceptable.' He said he had 'no tolerance for that kind of conduct. Where it takes place you can be sure that we will act to make sure that they are punished.' Miss Ferreira, who is still recovering from her injuries, said she now intends to sue the American embassy.","Probe found four Obama officials hired prostitutes in Brasilia nightclub .

John Edwards continued to ask his elderly heiress-turned benefactor for millions long after his failed bid for the presidency ended, even asking for $3million just months before he was indicted for corruption. Another witness, Edwards' former friend Tim Toben, recounted a conversation that he had with him in 2008, where he said that it would be as easy as a 'chip shot' for Rachel 'Bunny' Mellon, a rich heiress, to fund a foundation for $50million. A year later, after news of his affair with Rielle Hunter became public and his onetime aide Andrew Young was planning on releasing a memoir that told of their false paternity plot, Edwards saw Mr Toben again and turned the tables on Mr Young. Edwards said that Mr Young, who is now one of the lead witnesses for the prosecution, 'crossed a line'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Carrying on: Edwards' (right) court case is likely going to continue for another month or so, seen walking into the Greensboro courthouse on Monday with his 30-year-old daughter Cate . ABC News tells of how Mr Toben recounted: 'And then . (Edwards) said something frustrating to me: That Andrew had tried to . bilk Ms. Mellon out of $50million... I don't think he remembered a year . earlier he told me it would be a 'chip shot' for her to fund the . foundation, And it was the exact same number.' The money given by 101-heiress Ms . Mellon is at the heart of the Edwards corruption trial, as it has to be . determined whether or not the former Senator himself knew that the money . was used for his campaign or whether it was understood to be a ‘gift’ that could be put towards the cover-up of his pregnant mistress. If found guilty of breaking campaign finance laws, Edwards faces up to 30 years in prison. Two . of Monday’s witnesses focused their testimony on the heiress’ funds, . and one is thought to have given a slight advantage to Edwards’ defense . by saying she viewed her payments as gifts from one friend to another . rather than political contributions. 'I think her primary interest was in John as a person,’ Ms Mellon’s money manager Alex D. Forger told the court. ‘She in her later years has had few . close friends. Her husband had died, her daughter was ill. She took a . liking to Senator Edwards. Whatever was of interest to him, she would . support.’ Benefactor: Paul and Bunny Mellon seen circa 1987. Bunny is now blind and a recluse . 'Good morning for the home team': Edwards thought that the testimony put forth by Mellon-friend Alex Forger was good for his case, saying Mellon gave the money as a friend and not as a political contributor . Tallying up her . donations is the complicated crux of the trial, as she gave $2,300 to . the campaign- the amount legally allowed- along with $6.4million to . political action committees and organizations related to Edwards,  and . then a further $725,000 to former Edwards aide Andrew Young. Mr . Forger testified that Ms Mellon was asked for the $725,000 by Mr Young, . and she gave it even though he simply said it was for a ‘personal need’ of Edwards’ and did not specify further. It is now clear that personal need was the effort used to hide his mistress Rielle Hunter and her ever-growing baby bump. Edwards . maintains that he did not know of Mr Young’s requests, and that Mr . Young pocketed much of the money to build a mansion for his family. ‘She felt very strongly for John Edwards,’ Mr Forger told the court, explaining that her intentions were personal and ‘she wasn’t interested in becoming secretary of state’. In light of Mr Forger’s testimony, Edwards was overheard whispering ‘It was a good morning for the home team’ to his 30-year-old daughter Cate, who has been present throughout the trial. The tougher moment for Edwards’ team today, however, came when Ms Mellon’s librarian Tony Willis, who works in the heiress’ botanical library, began speaking about the letter he helped her draft when she decided to decline the former Senator’s request for $3million to help start the next phase of his life in 2011. Confidant: Bryan Huffman (right), an interior decorator, told the court about how Ms Mellon 'thought Edwards should pay for his girlfriend himself'. Edwards' mistress Rielle Hunter (seen with their daughter Frances Quinn in 2009) has been a frequent topic of the trial . Though the heiress got Mr Willis to help her draft the letter, her lawyers later stopped her from sending it because, at the time, it was well-documented that Edwards was the subject of a grand jury investigation. Edwards’ lawyers pushed- and were successful in their bid- to have this evidence removed from the trial, arguing that it would taint the juror’s impression of the man. They said that the $725,000 given by Ms Mellon during the actual campaign is the money in question, and not later amounts. Other personal friends of Ms Mellon have spoken at the trial, including the most entertaining testimony of interior designer Bryan Huffman. Family support: Edwards (right) has been accompanied to court by his daughter Cate (center), his father Wallace (foreground) and mother Bobbie (not pictured) Appearing in the Greensboro court last week, Mr Huffman said that Ms Mellon was not necesarily upset about the fact that Edwards had a pregnant mistress. Instead she was more bothered that it was her money being used to pay for it. 'She thought maybe you should probably pay for your girlfriend yourself,' he said in court, prompting an outburst of laughter- even from Edwards himself. Mr Huffman was involved in the case directly, as he helped write the checks that totalled $725,000 and helped cover their tracks by calling them part of a fledgling (faux) furniture business. The monetary requests and transfers between the Edwards camp and Ms Mellon have been occupying much of the trial, and one previous session revealed that the elderly heiress was 'apoplectic' when asked to donate $50million for a Edwards-intiated poverty foundation at one point.

Traces of pollen could hold the key to identifying a woman whose body was found in 1979 on an upstate New York farm. A type of pollen only found in the American Southwest was discovered on the murder victim's trousers using new technology, according to the Livingston County Sheriff's Office in Geneseo, New York. Authorities have since enlisted Albuquerque police in trying to identify the woman who also wore replica American Indian jewelry typically sold in New Mexico, Utah, Colorado and Arizona. Putting a name to the face: New forensics techniques have discovered traces of pollen for the southwest of the United States on the pants of an unidentified girl found murdered on a farm in upstate New York . Investigator . Tom Dougherty, whose rural department rarely has to investigate even one . homicide a year, said: 'We're not any closer to solving this . crime than we were when it happened years ago, but we think this new . information might help. 'We'd love to just identify the girl then maybe find . her killer.' Palynologists, or pollen experts, now have the ability to compare microscopic pollen samples to determine where the material originated. Among other things, they have identified pollen grains trapped in illegal drug shipments to help federal authorities against drug traffickers. The victim found in New York was believed to be 13 to 19 years old when she was shot, pulled into a cornfield, shot again, and stripped of any identification. Who are you: Computer generated images of the girl who was shot twice and dumped in a cornfield. She has never been identified . A farmer discovered her body in November 1979 while checking his fields off Route 20 in Caledonia, about 20 miles south of Rochester. The woman was described as 5 feet 3 inches tall, weighing about 120 pounds with brown eyes and brown frosted hair. She also had a bikini tan line and was wearing a red nylon-lined wind breaker made by Auto Sports Inc. Authorities have received hundreds of tips and tracked more than 10,000 leads across the U.S., Europe, Mexico and elsewhere. But no arrests have ever been made. John York, the first investigator on the scene in 1979 who is now the Livingston County sheriff, reopened the case and believes the new discovery might yield clues to help solve the case. Miles from home? The girl's body was found off the highway in the town of Caledonia, New York . Dougherty said the body was recently . exhumed to pull DNA evidence and send the information to a new national . database. That's when the pollen was discovered during a forensic study . by Texas A&M University, he said. Soon after the pollen discovery, authorities contacted Rich Lewis, a detective with the cold case unit of the Albuquerque Police Department. Lewis visited American Indian jewelers who told him that, according to photos, the jewelry found on the woman was likely replicas of Native American turquoise and silver jewelry. Detective Lewis said: 'So this stuff could have been purchased anywhere, even made from a kit. 'Or it could have been made by hippies in northern New Mexico, which was very common at the time. We just don't know.' Raking for clues: The girl was dressed in a red sports jacket made by Auto Sports Inc (left) and pants which forensics have now revealed contained pollen specific to the U.S. Identity: The teenager was wearing replica American Indian jewelry typically sold in New Mexico, Utah, Colorado and Arizona . Still, Lewis said investigators have an obligation to re-examine the case, especially because of the new evidence that points to the Southwest. Lewis said he doesn't believe the woman was homeless or forgotten based on the new evidence. 'She was somebody who had a life,' he said. 'And someone is missing her.'","New forensics revealed girl found in a New York field had pollen in her pants from southwest region .

Rapped: Madeline Grant (pictured) has been find £120 for bringing Oxford University's Union into disrepute after sparking a sexism row by boasting about her breasts during her election campaign for the post of librarian . An Oxford University student who boasted about her 'great' breasts in a bid to win votes in an election has been fined £120 for bringing its prestigious Union into 'disrepute'. Former model Madeline Grant was campaigning for the post of Union Librarian when she sparked a sexism row by making references to her cleavage in her manifesto. The 19-year-old, who is reading English literature and languages at St Hilda's College, declared in her campaign posters: 'I don't hack, I just have a great rack.' Her comments triggered howls of protest about her ‘sexist’ attempt to sway votes. Isabel Ernst, President of the Union, said Miss Grant had been fined £120 for bringing the Union into 'disrepute' by speaking out in the national press. Miss Grant defended her election campaign in the Daily Mail in March by claiming that the offending remark had been a satirical joke to liven up the historic debating society's notoriously ruthless elections. She said she altered her manifesto the next day to remove it, but the draft version was formally displayed in the Union for a day and was picked up and published by the student newspaper Cherwell. A spokeswoman for the Union said: 'Miss Grant spoke to the national press while on the committee without permission from the president, which is against Union rules.' She said Miss Grant had been a member of the standing committee, but lost her seat after what turned out to be an unsuccessful bid for the higher position of Union Librarian. The spokeswoman confirmed Miss Grant has since resigned from the Union. The Oxford Union was founded in 1823 and is one of the oldest debating societies in the world, with membership costing £200 for life. Past presidents include William Gladstone, William Hague, Boris Johnson and Michael Heseltine — and everyone from Albert Einstein to Michael Jackson has appeared there. Breached protocol: According to the Union, the 19-year-old former model (pictured) broke the rules by speaking to the national press while a member of the committee without seeking prior permission from the president . Backing: Her mother, BBC presenter and former world champion in real tennis, Sally Jones, has been supportive of her daughter's plight, saying she was 'very much a feminist' Miss Grant, the daughter of a . property developer, won a place at Oxford while attending £10,000-a-year . King Edward VI High School for Girls in Birmingham. She . is in her second year studying at St Hilda’s College, founded in 1893 . as a hall for women, although it has also admitted men since 2008. In her manifesto, rather than dwelling on weighty suggestions for running the library, her policies included being committed to helping members ‘pull’, or find a sexual partner, as well as the claim that she once had ‘a hug’n’kiss from Johnny Depp’ and had dated ‘a shady Japanese businessman’ to gain sponsorship for a ball held at the Union. A Union member said at the time: 'While this manifesto is clearly meant to be humorous, it shows a distinct lack of judgment. 'It is deeply saddening to see women objectifying themselves in manifestos.' Prestigious: The Oxford Union (above) was founded in 1823 and is one of the oldest debating societies in the world. Past presidents include William Gladstone, William Hague and Boris Johnson . Speaking to the Daily Mail in March, . she said: 'I thought my statement was really funny when I wrote it. I . wanted to do something provocative. 'I . wrote it in a hurry, I did it last-minute in a couple of days. But as . soon as I handed it in, I realised it might be offensive to some people, . so I rewrote it. The idea that I’m an anti-feminist is rubbish.' She said her manifesto was changed by replacing the ‘rack’ comment with: ‘I’m just here for the craic’, as in the Irish expression for fun. Miss Grant’s parents, who live in a £460,000 sprawling detached farmhouse in Ashorne, Warwickshire, have been supportive of their daughter. Her father, John Grant, 71, is a retired civil engineer who has sat on the boards of numerous construction firms and property companies in Warwickshire. Her mother, Sally Jones, 57, is a BBC journalist and former world champion in real tennis, the forerunner of lawn tennis. She said Madeline was 'very much a feminist'. Two years ago, her mother wrote an article for the Daily Mail about Madeline’s experience as a would-be fashion model. Aged 16, she modelled for a couple of designers at London Fashion Week. But a year later, after her concerned mother had encouraged her to eat more, she was told her 9st frame was too large for modelling — despite being 5ft 11in tall.","Ex-model Madeline Grant sparked sexism row with reference to cleavage .

The young boy is now receiving help for his addiction, but his small body has already been seriously damaged from the effects of his destructive habit. It's not the first time a shocking photo of a child smoking in Indonesia has emerged - a few years ago a series of photos were released showing two-year-old,Ardi Rizal, whose health has been so ruined by his 40-a-day habit that he now struggled to move by himself. Philanthropist: New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, is committing $220 million to go towards reducing tobacco use in countries with a high number of smokers . Indonesia, the fourth most populous country on earth, appears to be in the clutches of an uncontrolled tobacco habit. In Indonesia, it is perfectly legal for a child of any age to buy and smoke cigarettes. The release of Aldi Ilham's shocking photo, coincides with the news that New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, is committing $220 million to go towards reducing tobacco use in countries with a high number of smokers. The billionaire who made reducing smoking one of his signature causes as mayor and is expected to announce his four-year commitment to Bloomberg Philanthropies at the 15th World Conference on Tobacco or Health in Singapore today. The new commitment will bring the total amount he has directed to his eponymous charity to over $600 million since 2007. 'Tobacco kills every day, so we need to keep the fight moving forward and keep the momentum going,' Bloomberg said in a statement. Bloomberg, who made his fortune in the financial services industry, was ranked fifth on the Chronicle of Philanthropy's list of 50 of the 'most generous donors' for 2011. His new commitment will go toward . evidence-based initiatives including smoke-free laws, graphic pack . warnings and raising taxes, charity officials said. The . focus will be on country-level change, particularly in China, India, . Indonesia, Russia and Bangladesh, which officials say account for the . largest share of tobacco use in the world.

They were hired at a cost of more than £140,000 by a cash-strapped police force to reassure a concerned public that laying-off 500 officers as part of swingeing £50million cuts would not harm the fight against crime. But Sussex Police's controversial decision to recruit five spin doctors while simultaneously slashing the number of frontline officers has provoked new outrage after their communications manager used her official Twitter account to Tweet pictures of cakes. Sarah Gillespie wrote: ‘A typical Friday in Corporate Comms!’ alongside a picture of office desks loaded with sweet treats. Priorities: Communication manager Sarah Gillespie has provoked anger after using her official Sussex Police twitter account to discuss cakes rather than crime prevention . In March Sussex Police claimed they were advertising for new posts to maintain their ‘popular website’, ‘teach officers to use Twitter’ and sell the idea of cuts to its workforce. She is one of three divisional managers in a team of 20 communications staff. The force has come under fire after it emerged the rest of the force was in the middle of a £50 million cost-cutting programme involving the loss of 500 officers and 550 other staff. Spin: Sarah Gillespie is part of a 20 strong team in Sussex Police's communications department . All the jobs advertised had salaries of between £25,449 and £28,107. Robert Oxley from the Taxpayers Alliance said: ‘Taxpayers will think they are better off served by police officers rather than press officers. ‘With Police forces under pressure to find necessary savings, it’s incredible that Sussex has the money to expand its cake-tweeting comms department but has cut the number of front line officers. ‘Police chiefs need to get their priorities straight, that means bobbies on the beat not spin doctors who tweet.’ The force’s corporate communications . and public engagement department has a £1.1 million annual budget - a . reduction of £16,000 since the cuts began last year. The . force said it was not recruiting any extra staff but replacing five . posts because of departures, maternity leave and role changes. A spokesman for Sussex Police said when the recruitment drive was first publicised, said: ‘Keeping the public well informed and using communications to enhance operational policing are ongoing priorities for us. ‘The corporate communications and public engagements and public engagement department carries out a wide range of tasks from witness appeals about murders and updates during large policing events to maintaining our popular website and advising on the best ways to communicate in local areas. Time for cake?: Sussex Police are in the middle of £50million worth of swinging cuts, including the loss of more than 1,000 frontline officers and staff . ‘A small team of specialists provides these services in the most effective way, rather than others in the force being abstracted from their own work.’ He said the department is not growing and the recruitment was caused by departures and maternity leave. Three of the posts are temporary. A Sussex Police spokesman said today: 'The . photo was posted by one of our staff, via her own phone and on to what . was then her own Twitter account, during her lunch break. 'The contents of that account have since been automatically added to what is now her official force Twitter account. 'It . is not unknown for staff in all walks of life to bring cakes into the . office. This particular occasion marked the departure of two staff from . the Department. 'There has been no increase in the size of the Department, the budget for which has decreased in the past year.' The controverail recruitment last year was greeting with mixed opinion by some of those hoping to stand for election as the country’s first police and crime commissioner in November. Conservative Peter Jones, leader of East Sussex County Council, said: ‘Police, like everybody else, need to communicate effectively with the public. ‘However in those terms, when frontline police officer posts are under pressure I think we need to take a careful look at the level of press establishment.’ Labour Paul Richards said: ‘You need people to be able to tell the public how their money is being spent.’ Ian Chisnall, who intends to stand as an independent candidate said: ‘I would err on the side that more communications are better than less communications but obviously there has to be a sense of proportion with it all. ‘If one department was growing fat while everyone else was on rations that then becomes a risk that the people you want to do the communications become the story.’","Sussex Police hired the spin doctors while faced with making £50million worth of cuts .

Love triangle: Brandi Glanville, pictured here at her son's sports game earlier this month, has revealed she almost turned physical on Eddie Cibrian's new love LeAnn Rimes . Rage: The reality star, pictured far right, wanted to 'kill' LeAnn when she first saw the country singer sitting with her husband and children. She says relations have now thawed a little . 'I remember walking up to soccer practice and there she was with my baby in her lap,' Brandi tells Australia's NW magazine (an excerpt appears on RadarOnline). 'My blood was boiling, and I thought I was going to kill her. I really thought I was going to physically hurt her. Happier days: Brandi and Eddie in 2005 . 'That was the first time I saw her that way - she was sitting in my soccer chair, under my tent, she's got my kid on her lap and she's with my husband, and that was that little moment of total irrational fury.' RadarOnline claims that LeAnn Rimes has even considered taking out a restraining order on Brandi because she was so 'haunted' by the chilling interview. Eddie dumped Brandi in 2009 following almost a decade of marriage after beginning an affair with LeAnn on the set of their film Northern Lights. They have two children together; Mason, 8, and Jake, 5. The reality star says relations with LeAnn have now improved. 'We're never going to be best friends, but she's good to my kids, they love her and that's all I could ask for,' Brandi said. 'If they didn't like her, I'd be in court right now, fighting. It's not about me - it's about them.' But Brandi admits she is irritated that the couple, who renewed their vows on their one-year wedding anniversary last month, are preventing her children from appearing on the Real Housewives.

Growing up in Tennessee, where her mother worked as a university professor, Satara Stratton had dreamed of escaping to Hollywood to become a movie star. But just eight months after the 24-year-old made the leap to pursue that dream, she has been reported missing and is believed to have become swept up in the city's seedy underworld. Her mother Sharon Stratton, who has not heard from her daughter since November, believes she is addicted to heroin and under the influence of a registered sex offender. Fall: Police are searching for actress Satara Stratton, pictured. She is believed to be addicted to heroin and under the influence of a sex offender. Recent mug shots show a stark contrast with earlier photos . Satara, whose stage name is Satara Silver, left home in June 2011 for the West Coast, where she enjoyed early success in a handful of films, including a horror flick called Cult Movie. Determined to make a success of her new life, the petite blonde also began taking classes and started a job at the Disney Store on Santa Monica Boulevard. But it was short lived, as she was robbed outside a bank and hospitalised, causing her to miss a semester of school, her mother told the Los Angeles Times. She added that her daughter's troubles worsened when a fellow employee began extorting money from her and harassing her. While making a film, Satara met 46-year-old registered sex offender Paul Constantinescu, who runs a rubber stamp company on Santa Monica Boulevard, according to the LA Times. Search: Police are looking for Stratton, left, . and Paul Constatinescu, right, a registered sex offender, who has been . spotted with the missing girl and reportedly led her to suicidal . thoughts in the past . Hometown: Before moving to Los Angeles, Satara lived in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where her mother is a professor of anthropology at the University of Tennessee, pictured . Police . have arrested her on several occasions, with her mugshots documenting . how her life appears to be spiralling out of control. Arrests have . included possession of narcotics . in a hospital. Los Angeles police are now looking for Stratton, as well as Constantinescu, with whom she is friends on Facebook. Investigators have visited Constantinescu's address, but he was not there. On the state's Megan's Law website, Constantinescu's offenses are listed as attempted lewd and lascivious conduct with a child under 14 and attempted forced oral copulation with a minor under 14. Detective Carmine Sasso of the LAPD's Missing Persons Unit told the Culver City Patch that Constantinescu . is not accused of any wrongdoing. Career: Satara (right) has appeared in several films, including the 2010 movie Fairer Blood, pictured . But he added that authorities have released his photo as . Stratton has 'been seen with him, and if he pops up, maybe he can say, . ""Oh, she's over there"".' 'We're . doing all we can to generate feedback,' he told the Patch. 'The mother is very concerned because [Stratton] is looking worse and . worse in the photos we have.' He said she has been spotted at the . 6500 block of Santa Monica Boulevard in the heart of Hollywood and . appealed to the public for further information. He added that her . situation is not unique. 'These . young people come out from another state, some small town, to a . multimillion population, trying to hit it big and they get caught up,' he said. 'You have these predators who prey on these individuals.' Sightings: Stratton, who appeared in a handful of films, has been seen 6500 block of Santa Monica Boulevard . Job: Satara was working at a Hollywood Disney Store when she was robbed outside a bank and hospitalised, missing a term of school. Her mother said that is where her problems began . Police are considering her 'voluntarily missing' - but her mother refuses to believe it, saying that Satara was always in touch regularly. The last time Sharon spoke to her daughter was in November to arrange for Satara to see her grandmother before she died. Satara’s grandmother, with whom she was close, died in January and 'she would never have missed that', Sharon told the LA Times. 'She had never, ever done anything until these men came into her life. She wasn’t into drugs,' she added. Sharon wrote a blog post for the . Examiner.com in which she claimed her daughter was in the custody of . 'stalker turned abductor Paul Constantinesco - he and his group place . Satara into life threatening situations via use of drugs, and coercion . through violence', according to the Patch. Downfall: Police mug shots from drug charges show Stratton looking increasingly disheveled and ill . She later posted a message calling for help on Facebook, writing that her daughter 'has health issues risk to life, and previous torture by this man lead to suicidal ideas, and he forced drugs'. Authorities would not divulge the nature of her health issues. On her Facebook page, the concerned mother wrote: 'Satara is not voluntarily missing; she has had no contact with not only family but friends throughout this occurrence.' Sasso added: 'On the surface, she’s an adult and can do whatever she wants. 'But you start digging below the surface and you find these connections and you can’t ignore these connections.

Under fire: Mayor Boris Johnson has been accused of 'public health fraud' over his use of dust suppresants . Boris Johnson has been accused of 'public health fraud' for ordering the use of dust suppressants to cut readings at pollution monitoring stations in London. The London Mayor could be avoiding hundreds of millions in EU fines by ordering the use of sprays to cut the amount of dust in the air near pollution monitoring stations. But the tactic could also be putting the public at risk by masking the true extent of pollution levels in the city and preventing smog warnings when pollution is severe. Simon Birkett, director of Clean Air in London told MailOnline: 'This is deadly serious. We’re talking about dangerous particles, some of which are toxic or carcinogenic, not inert house dust. 'It’s public health fraud on an industrial scale to use pollution suppressants in front of the air quality monitors most relied on to warn the public of smog episodes and report legal breaches. 'The Mayor needs to reduce pollution at source not hide it from monitors.' The tactic was revealed in a report by the Mayor's office recocomending the use of the sticky salt spray along busy streets, particularly during the Olympic Games. Saline solution sprayed by trucks usually used for salting roads in winter makes fine dust particles stick to the ground rather than hover in the air. Pollution hot-spots like Upper Thames Street, Marylebone Road and Neasden Lane are among the 15 sites were the so-called 'dust suppressants' are alreay being used. All of the sites are close to official air quality monitoring stations which measure the level of pollution in the city, Mr Birkett pointed out. He said Upper Thames Street, in the . City. was the first to record a breach in air quality levels, while . Marylebone Road, in Westminster, is the location of the government's own . pollution monitoring station. Pollution levels are measured in tiny particles of soot and dirt from traffic emissions. When inhaled, the particulate matter, known as PM10s, can cause heart and lung problems. The daily limit of PM10 in the UK must not be higher than 50 micrograms per metre squared more than 35 times in a calendar year to meet European Commission targets. Olympic route: The first sighting of the dust suppressor truck on the streets of London . Even with the use of dust . suppressants, on Neasden Lane this level has already been exceeded 32 . times since the beginning of 2012, while in Upper Thames Street it has . been exceeded 28 times, Clean Air in London claims. On Marylebone Road the level has been breached 25 times, according to figures provided by the campaign group. If . and when the EC quota is breached the UK could find itself facing the . European Court of Justice, which enforces European law. The country . faces a fine of £300million if it fails to clean up its act. The . Department for the Environment issued its first summer smog alert the . weekend before last after high ozone levels were recorded. This kind of . pollution, the most dangerous for athletes, occurs when sunlight reacts . with pollutants. Mr Birkett said: 'Marylebone Road and Upper Thames Street are at the absolute heart of the Olympic road network. 'TFL's plan for dealing with pollution during the Olympics is to use the suppressor truck. Unbelievable.' The Mayor's own pollution strategy recommends the use of the suppressants to achieve 'compliance' with European standards. The document reads: 'There are other days where a location only just exceeds the EU limit value. 'In . these circumstances a reduction in local emissions or concentrations . (for example, by preventing re-suspension) will help achieve . compliance.' Heart of the City: The daily limit of PM10 pollution on Upper Thames Street has been exceeded 28 times so far this year . Dirty: The limit has been breached in Neasden Lane 32 times . West End: And in Westminster's Marylebone Road the limit has been exceeded 25 times. Clean Air in London believes this picture shows residue from saline spray . Mr Johnson's office has said the suppressants are part of a short term strategy to cut pollution alongside long term measures to improve air quality like bringing in more low emission zones and planting more trees. His office told the Daily Telegraph that having monitors at the busiest traffic spots made sense as it forces the UK to clean up its dirtiest air, and that these were also the most important areas to use dust suppressants. But Mr Birkett claimed the suppressants were simply being used to avoid taking firm action on pollution. 'What this is about is that actually we need to be focusing on the solutions,' he said. 'This is mainly a diesel problem and we need to be focusing on diesel emissions. 'Our low emission zone is two years and two steps behind the one in Berlin and that's the real test of whether we are getting to grips with pollution levels.'","Trucks spraying saline solution to clear the air of fine dust particles from traffic exhausts .
