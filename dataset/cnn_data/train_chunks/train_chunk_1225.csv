"In the last few years, the beard has had a renaissance. No longer just the preserve of tramps and lumberjacks, it is now seen on lawyers, bar staff and artists across the western world who have wanted to add a bit of edge to their look. The move has not gone unnoticed by the fairer sex, many of whom are delighted at the new facial hair trend. So it can only be good news that a new dating website has emerged, specifically linking up beard lovers with men who have beards. Scroll down for video . New dating website Bristlr matches beard lovers to men with beards. The site launched six weeks ago and it already has tens of thousands of users . John Kershaw from Manchester launched Bristlr six weeks ago and already tens of thousands of people have signed up. He started the project as a bit of a joke after suggesting the idea on Facebook and seeing a positive response from his friends. The (bearded) 28-year-old software developer said: 'When I posted the question on my Facebook page, my friends said they thought it was a really good idea. 'So  I made this fake landing site where people could sign up to this app that didn't really exist, just because I was curious to see how far people would go with it.' In the last week alone, more than 10,000 new people signed up to the site . He continued: 'I wanted to see who was willing to go through the hassle of signing up, giving their email address, etc. 'After 100 people signed up in four days, I thought there must be some scope, so I made a proper website and launched  it four weeks ago. 'It has kind of got a little bit out of hand at this moment, so I'm just kind of going with it, which is great fun.' John Kershaw from Manchester launched Bristlr six weeks ago . In the last week alone, more than 10,000 new people signed up to the site and when the IOS and Android apps are launched in a couple of weeks, those numbers are likely to grow even faster. John admits he can't believe how successful it has been so far, especially as it started out as a bit of a joke. He said: 'We are comfortably in the five figures now. It does surprise me because I'm very cynical and I think it is such a stupid idea that no one is going to want to do it. 'But it turns out that actually, people think it's kind of cool. I've started to talk to the people using it, and some say that it is the best dating site they've ever used. 'I think it's the fact that instead of it being this serious business like “Hey, if you click this button we're going to do this serious thing,” it's more like “Hey, I like your beard.” 'It’s light-hearted - you can't take it too seriously, which I think is really appealing to people. I did build a block button just in case though, because inevitably there are going to be creepy dudes. 'I’m sure there will also be guys who go on there without beards to try and pick up women, but they're not going to have much luck.' The site uses a minimal amount of information from users, so as not to be too invasive. But it does keep a tally of people with beards and people who love beards - the ratio is almost 50:50. John said: 'I've been quite surprised by the ratio of beards to people looking for beards.' The site keeps a tally of people with beards and people who love beards - the ratio is almost 50:50 . 'We don't track whether people are male or female, just whether or not they have a beard or they are looking for someone with a beard - we track the import stuff. 'It's just under half of people who have beards on Bristlr. 'I think I was expecting it to be 90 per cent people with beards.' That isn't the only surprise, John is also amazed by the different countries around the world where the site has already become a hit. He said: 'It's only international by chance - because I was too lazy to limit it when I was building the site.' The site is already in the UK, Holland, Canada and the US . He continued: ''It's really big in Holland and I had someone from Montreal today tell me it is now getting quite big over there, which is ridiculous. 'San Francisco was one of the first cities to embrace it. 'It's catching on slowly in New York, but I feel like they're slightly more cynical about it.' John admits that it may just be a craze while the beard trend lasts, but he is enjoying it while it does. He said: 'I know beards are definitely in, people have realised they are kind of lovely. Keep it neat. Invest in some nice beard oil, get a good pair of trimmers and just experiment. If you feel good in your beard then that comes across as confidence. A good beard doesn’t replace your personality but it does compliment it. 'I get that it is personal preference, just like some people like short hair and some like it long. 'I know some people who are repulsed by beards and some people just love them. 'You can tell a lot about a man by his beard, not that they just have one, because they may have just forgotten to shave. 'But just like seeing someone with a really nice suit or haircut, a nice well-kept beard shows some pride in appearance.'","Site launched six weeks ago and it already has tens of thousands of users .

"Judge Howard Crowson showed no sympathy when he was told Anthony Hall (pictured) had been injured when he attempted to commit a burglary . A burglar who was beaten up after breaking into a former rugby player's flat got what he deserved, a judge told him. Anthony Hall was left bloodied and bruised when he tried to attack the homeowner who caught him attempting to steal his television in the middle of the night. Jailing him, Judge Howard Crowson told the 22-year-old it was 'inevitable' he would be beaten up, adding: 'That's the risk you take.' Hall, a serial criminal, broke into Stephen Waterfield's home in Redcar, near Middlesbrough, in September. Mr Waterfield, 48, woke at 12.30am to find Hall in his living room and confronted him. Hall tried to claim he was in the wrong house, saying he believed the property was his friend's. He then lunged at Mr Waterfield, who is 6ft, 13½ stone and used to play at flanker for Redcar's rugby union team. He instinctively defended himself as Hall bombarded him with kicks and punches, prosecutor David Crook told Teesside Crown Court. Mr Waterfield overpowered Hall and turned to find his phone to call police. But the burglar kicked him in the face and tried to flee. 'Mr Waterfield managed to strike him from behind to try to detain him,' Mr Crook said. Hall, who fled empty-handed but was subsequently arrested, was left with two gashes to his head, a blackened left eye and a swollen cheek. But Judge Crowson said he could not use his injuries in mitigation after he admitted burglary. Jailing Hall, of Newcastle upon Tyne, for three years and four months, he added: 'The police are never able to encourage members of the public to act in this way. But I'm afraid it is inevitable if someone like Mr Waterfield finds someone like you in his home, that something like this might happen. 'Having challenged you, he was effectively attacked by you. As it happens, he seems to have managed to inflict more injury on you, than you did him.' Scroll down for video . Steve Waterfield, 48, the burly rugby player  fought back against burglar Anthony Hall when he found him in his home . Hall had attack the householder at his Jameson Ave, Redcar, flat but was overpowered and fled into the night empty handed . Structural engineer Mr Waterfield, who suffered a swollen arm and wrist as well as facial bruising, described Hall's sentence as a 'good deterrent'. 'I was glad that the judge took the point of view that he got what he deserved,' he said. 'An Englishman's home is his castle and he made a big mistake when he decided to come into mine. I think it's any homeowner's right to defend themselves and their property in the best way they can.' Mr Waterfield said of his own injuries: 'I've had injuries on the rugby field that were a lot worse than anything he could have inflicted.' Tony Martin was convicted of manslaughter for killing burglar Fred Barras after he broke into his home . The most famous case of a homeowner defending himself against a burglar is that of Tony Martin. In 1999, the Norfolk farmer  shot two burglars in the back after allegedly having his property raided on ten previous occasions. Martin killed 16-year-old Fred Barras and seriously injured Brendan Fearon, then 28, with a shotgun after the pair broke into his farmhouse . He was first convicted of murder and later manslaughter following an appeal. He was released from jail for good behaviour in 2003. Public outrage over the case was such that it finally prompted a change in the law to allow homeowners the power to use reasonable force' to defend themselves.","Anthony Hall, 24, of Newcastle, attacked the man whose home he invaded .

"An award-winning financial adviser has admitted masterminding a £2.6 million fraud by convincing clients that he was investing their money in property in India. Alok Dhanda, 53, conned 37 investors including one woman who lost £258,000 when his scheme collapsed. Newcastle Crown Court heard that Dhanda, of Gosforth, Newcastle admitted 24 charges of fraud, having previously admitted similar charges at an earlier hearing.

The father-of-two appeared in court via video-link, where he had been previously remanded in custody. Dhanda, who won the title of independent financial adviser of the year in 2006 and was runner up twice, will be sentenced on December 19. Mr Recorder Nicholas Lumley QC gave no indication what the likely sentence would be at the next hearing and remanded Dhanda in custody in the meantime. The judge said: 'The fact is, fraudulently he obtained £2.6m. 'To sustain the fraud he gave a small portion of that back to other people.' Proscutor James Adkin told the court: 'There are some 37 victims on two indictments. 'This is a serious case. It is a case which will have public interest in Tyneside.' Sailesh Mehta, defending, said Dhanda did not pocket the entire £2.6m as some of the cash was on a 'merry go round' from one victim to another, to keep the scam going. Several of Dhanda's victims packed the public gallery during the short hearing.

"A secret government program called Hemisphere gives federal agents nearly instantaneous access to billions of AT&T phone records dating as far back as 1987, all without a court order or the oversight of a judge, it was revealed today. It's a spying database that dwarfs anything built by the National Security Agency to date - and federal agents have routine access to it to conduct criminal investigations. The AT&T database contains the location, time, phone number and other metadata from every phone call that crosses the AT&T relay switches - an estimated 4billion calls a day. Because the database captures any call that travels across the company's lines, calls made by users of other carriers are also included. Since 2007, federal agents have been able to access the trove of information in minutes - simply by issuing a subpoena. It appears little or no judicial oversight governs the access to this information. Hemisphere is not classified - but it was secret for nearly five years. It is run by the Drug Enforcement Administration . Hemisphere is not related to any of the . National Security Agency spying programs that were revealed by . whistle-blower Edward Snowden. Rather, it is run by law enforcement - . primarily the Drug Enforcement Administration. Its stated purpose . is help investigate drug traffickers and other complex criminal . enterprises. However, it has also been used to arrest jewelry store . robbers, a murder suspect and even a woman who was making nuisance bomb . threats. Since the program began six years . ago, the government has retrieved information 4,400 times from the . database - obtaining data on 11,200 phone numbers. That's at least twice . a day, on average. The government pays AT&T employees . to . work alongside federal agents. They have direct access . to the database and it is their job to retrieve the information from the company files and hand it over to federal investigators. The company will hand over the data with only an 'administrative subpoena' issued by . the law enforcement agency. It often does not require a court . order. The program is not classified - just 'law enforcement sensitive.' However, the New York Times reports that there have been no Congressional hearings, nor news reports about Hemisphere since it was adopted six years ago. The program is meant to help track drug organizations that use disposable 'burner' phones and frequently change numbers . Drew Hendricks, an anti-war activist from Port Hadlock, Washington, received a PowerPoint presntation detailing the program as part of a Freedom of Information Act request. The program is designed to give the . federal government fast and direct access to a detailed, expansive . AT&T call database - though it uses AT&T employees as an . intermediary. An employee of the communications giant is always the one . to access the company logs - not a federal agent. Names . are not attached to the call information stored in the database. However, last year AT&T began cross-referencing other databases to . hand over the names of any of its subscribers who match the numbers . being targeted. Records go back more than two and a half decades to 1987. The Times reports that in many cases, . no court order or grand jury subpoena is needed to receive these . records - meaning that checks and balances on the process are limited or . even non-existent. Hemisphere operates out of three offices - Los Angeles, Houston and Atlanta. It is based in Los Angeles. Hemisphere is meant to help . law enforcement agencies track suspects and criminal enterprises who . frequently change phones - using disposable 'burners' phones to acquire . new numbers every few days or weeks. Call activity logs also allow federal agents pinpoint which numbers a suspect is calling to help them outline the various parts of a criminal enterprise. In 2011, the program helped with a bust that seized 136 kilograms of cocaine, one ton of marijuana and 'really pissed off the Hells Angels in Canada.' It's also been used to crack smaller-scale crimes, including the 2012 bust of a robbery ring that targeted jewelry stores, the arrest of a man on charges he murdered a bar bouncer in Rondo Beach, California. This February, the program was used to help arrest a South Carolina woman who called in 30 bomb threats to schools, hospitals, banks and government offices in South Carolina.","Hemisphere program allows federal agents to access details on rolling database of 4billion calls a day that are process through AT&T switches .

"The last time I saw this sort of media hullabaloo in honour of a new baby, I was standing outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington. Today, we are actually here to glimpse four new arrivals — three little boys and a girl. But they are all related, since they all share the same father. And as far as the world of racing is concerned, they have a pedigree every bit as regal as young Prince George. For this lot represent the first crop of progeny from arguably the greatest racehorse in history — Frankel, the stallion who never lost a race. And they're off: The first Frankel foal to be sold, this colt by Crystal Gaze, changed hands for £1.15million at a sale at Kensington Palace in June. It was bought by Ireland's Coolmore Stud . And this week, the racing industry has been enjoying a good gawp as four of his ‘Frankelfoals’ have been the star attractions at the Newmarket stables of Tattersalls, the famous equestrian auctioneers. It is now two years since the British-born bay superhorse thundered across the finish at Ascot to claim a record-breaking 14th victory (out of 14 races) in front of his terminally-ill trainer, the late Sir Henry Cecil. It was as emotional a day as most racing veterans can remember. Since then, Frankel has settled in to a new life at Banstead Manor stud farm outside Newmarket, where breeders and their mares are queuing up for his procreational services at £125,000-a-time. And now the first results have been on display. Newly-weaned and accompanied by a personal groom and 24-hour security, these foals are on their first trip away from mother and home. It’s already a test of character. Even to an untrained eye like mine, there is something rather majestic about the lively and surprisingly furry son-of-Frankel being led around in circles in front of a couple of propsective buyers. I hardly know my fetlock from my withers, but even I can still discern that this particular creature has a certain confidence and poise — almost haughtiness — which many of the gawky young things on sale here do not possess. Girl power: The as yet unnamed chestnut filly from Norelands Stud in Ireland is pictured in Newmarket . No doubt this vivacious creature is a ghastly show-off in the thoroughbred playground — ‘My Dad’s won more races than all your Mums and Dads, so ner-ner-nee-ner-ner . . .’ — but that is precisely the sort of quality owners are looking for. Tattersalls draws a big crowd every year for its foal sale, when over 1,000 untested thoroughbred infants change hands for astonishing sums of money. As Tatersalls director Jimmy George explains, the average price paid for a foal at last year’s four-day sale was just under £45,000. Today, the chief talking point in the bars and stable blocks has been Frankel’s offspring. Will they turn out to be a chip off the old block — or just genetic hype? Since his first foal was born in January, he has sired more than 100 colts and fillies. Most of these will remain under lock and key until they make their debut on a racecourse in 2016 (horses cannot race until they are two). But there are always a few breeders who want to see a return on their investment sooner rather than later. So they want to sell now. It might be a wise move. These creatures carry no guarantee of racing prowess. One of the greatest racehorses of the last century, Brigadier Gerard, spent years on stud duty and sired one disappointment after another. Winning team: Henry Cecil with Frankel at Ascot after winning The Queen Anne Stakes Royal in 2012 . Nature has a similar policy with the human race. Pele might have been the greatest international footballer of his age. But the Brazilian maestro’s son, Edinho, had an undistinguished career in domestic football before things really went downhill. Six months ago, he received a 33-year prison sentence for laundering drug money. So, until the first crop of Frankel’s offspring have run a few races, his talent as a stud remains unproven. But many people have still come to Tattersalls trying to look for tell-tale signs in the four foals which are here. The first one I see is a perky chestnut filly being led around under the watchful eye of Matt Gilsenan, farm manager for Norelands Stud in Ireland. The farm has two of Frankel’s offspring up for sale here, this filly and a bay colt. Neither has a name because you don’t name a horse until it enters training. A potential buyer in a flat cap appears and whispers that he’d like to have a peek at the colt. The stable door opens and out comes a feisty bay (dark brown) specimen, a dead ringer for Dad. The would-be buyer nods enigmatically and leaves. These auctions are a very congenial affair — Newmarket’s hotels and bars have been full for days — but the jargon, like the thumping great catalogue, is impenetrable. To compound the confusion, every transaction is conducted in guineas. Newmarket folk still regard the pound as a rather vulgar denomination. Don’t get them started on the euro. Mishap: The Cheveley Park colt had to leave the sale . Matt Gilsenan has lost count of the number of people asking to see his ‘Frankels’. ‘I think the colt alone has done 90 shows today,’ he says. Surely, I suggest, a lot of people are just time-wasters? ‘Maybe,’ he says with a smile. ‘But you never know who they are or who they might be buying for.’ You can make no assumptions about anyone here. It’s raining, it’s muddy and most people are in wet-weather gear. A lady in a green anorak and old boots turns out to be Kirsten Rausing, expert breeder, scion of the Tetrapak family, and one of the wealthiest women in the world. Seeking out another mini-Frankel, I meet top agent, Tom Goff of Blandford Bloodstock. It’s like going wine-tasting with a claret guru. ‘Fantastic mover,’ mutters Tom as Lot Number 1103 — a bay Frankel colt by the American dam, Swiss Lake — is led out of his box for our perusal. ‘That’s a horse that covers plenty of ground . . . good reach in front . . . great bone . . . very correct . . . a kind eye . . . great demeanour . . . an honest head . . . ’ This particular colt is being sold (or, in racing jargon, ‘consigned’) by the New England Stud. ‘He’s a stand-out horse with a great presence,’ says manager, Peter Stanley, himself from illustrious racing stock. His elder brother, Teddy Stanley, is the Earl of Derby and it was their ancestor who lent his name to the most famous race in the world. In another yard, I find the fourth Frankel foal, a chestnut colt out of the British dam, Red Bloom, herself a winner of six races and £436,000. ‘He’s got a good attitude,’ explains Chris Richardson, managing director of Cheveley Park Stud, ‘and he’s got a long ear. I do like a long ear.’ Stud hand Matthew Crick, whose job is to look after this colt day and night, adds: ‘He’s the boss in his paddock.’ What’s it like nannying such a valuable bit of horseflesh? ‘Quite nerve-racking,’ Matthew admits. It’s always a tricky business with hyperactive toddlers like this. And so it proves soon afterwards when this colt bangs a leg on the side of his box. It’s not serious or even unusual, but he still has to be withdrawn from the sale. The market is still all over the place when it comes to valuing these creatures. This summer, the first Frankel foal to go on sale, a colt owned by a branch of the Qatari royal family, fetched a cool £1.15 million. ‘I’d rather we hadn’t sold him but we have another 11 Frankel foals at home,’ says their racing adviser, David Redvers of Tweenhills Stud. ‘And there are two of those that I wouldn’t swap for any other horse alive.’ Frankel ridden by Tom Queally after winning the Qipco Champion Stakes during QIPCO British Champions Day at Ascot . Only last week, another Frankel foal, a filly, broke the Irish record when she was sold at auction for £1.4 million. Yet, two others were withdrawn from the same sale when they failed to reach their reserve prices. In their case, the market simply wasn’t convinced that the price was right. Last night, the remaining Tattersalls three finally came under the hammer, but all failed to reach their reserve prices (which were not disclosed). The highest bid was £367,500 for Peter Stanley’s ‘stand-out’ colt. Despite the anti-climax, the general view is that most of these foals will return to the auction ring in 2015 as yearlings (which tend to attract higher prices anyway). As for future foals, prices will soar if this first crop does well in competition — as will Frankel’s own worth. And he’s already valued at more than £100 million. But here in Newmarket, I can’t help feeling a little sorry for the Frankel brood. They may be more pampered than the only child of an oligarch, but the attention is remorseless, the pressure is already on and they are only eight months old. There will, surely, come a moment when they look out across their manicured paddock and think: ‘I wish was a Shetland pony.’","Four horses will be auctioned at Tattersall Sales in Newmarket this week .

"The bullet which lodged in a police officer’s radio in the gunfight which led to Mark Duggan being shot dead was police issue ammunition, it was reported last night. The revelation will fuel the fury in Tottenham about the killing of the father of four by armed officers. The bullet which was found lodged in the radio of one of the officers at the scene is still undergoing forensic tests. It was initially suggested by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) that Met officers returned fire after someone in the minicab opened fire. But sources have said the first ballistics examinations suggested it was police issue. Shot dead: The death of father-of-four Mark Duggan sparked the initial riots in Tottenham and rumours spreading 'like wildfire' on the internet are thought to have fuelled further unrest in other parts of the capital . What a waste: An historic department store that survived the blitz is ravaged by flames during the riots as firefighters can only look on and watch . These are very distinct as the Metropolitan Police uses hollowed-out bullets designed not to pass through an object. The news has undermined suggestions that there was an exchange of fire between Mr Duggan and the police before he died. Yesterday the IPCC was forced to deny reports that Mr Duggan was ‘assassinated’ as rumours spread like wildfire on the internet that he was unarmed, having put his gun down on the ground when he was shot. Mr Duggan’s brother’s Shaun Hall said he would never have shot at police, saying it was ‘utter rubbish’. ‘My brother’s not that sort of person,’ he said. ‘He’s not stupid to shoot at the police, that’s ridiculous.’ Should David Cameron cut short his holiday to deal with the riots and economy? Should David Cameron cut short his holiday to deal with the riots and economy? Now share your opinion . Mr Hall said he did not condone the rioting. ‘I know people are frustrated, they’re angry out there at the moment, but I would say please try and hold it down. Please don’t make this about my brother’s life, he was a good man. ‘We’re all devastated about the mishap, we don’t actually know what has actually happened. ‘Nobody’s actually come forward and told us, “This is what has taken place”. Whether we believe what they’re saying or whether we don’t, there should be somebody here putting my parents’ minds at rest about whatever’s going on.’ His grieving mother Pamela  was still wearing her dressing gown at midday when she came to the door of her semi in Tottenham and said: ‘I can’t sleep, I can’t think. We are all in too much of a state to say anything.’ Looted: This electronics shop in Tottenham was entirely stripped out as looting was encouraged via Twitter . Shattered: Every pane of glass is broken in a Wood Green mobile phone shop - and all the phones inside taken . Wrecked: This shop looks as if a bomb had hit it, as rioters took anything they could . Mr Duggan’s fiancee Semone Wilson said: ‘The rioting wasn’t planned. It’s a reaction of angry people that just wanted justice for Mark. ‘It’s sad what happened but all we wanted were answers and we didn’t get any. ‘Because we didn’t get any answers, this is the result. ‘There is no way the family wanted this trouble, innocent people being hurt. It is silly and it just got so out of control.’ Yesterday Twitter was flooded with posts speculating about a police ‘execution’, while others said Mr Duggan was targeted because he was known to be a crack dealer and linked to the area’s many gangs, including the ‘N17 Farm’ based around the Broadwater Farm estate. Confrontation: Masked vandals were met by police in riot gear throughout the night . Shells: Buildings in the area stood destroyed yesterday morning as a result of the riots . These pictures capture the brutal aftermath of the riots, with windows smashed and debris strewn around the streets . Burnt-out: Whole blocks of houses have been destroyed, and continued smouldering throughout Sunday . One tweet compared his death to that of Jean Charles de Menezes and the singer Smiley Culture, who is said to have stabbed himself to death when officers arrived to question him over drugs offences.

She said: ‘The investigation into the circumstances of Mark Duggan’s death must remain my priority. ‘It is important however that I address some of the misinformation circling around – much of which is unhelpful, and some of which is inflammatory. 'Speculation that Mark Duggan was “assassinated” in an execution style involving a number of shots to the head are categorically untrue. ‘Following the formal identification of the body Mr Duggan’s family know that this is not the case and I would ask anyone reporting this to be aware of its inaccuracy and its inflammatory nature. ‘The IPCC is investigating not only the actions of the officer firing the shots but also the planning, decision making and implementation of the police operation. ‘Our lines of inquiry include the bullets fired and any firearms used and recovered.’ She added: ‘I know there are concerns that we have not provided enough support to the family in the first days – and I am very sorry if anyone should feel that.’","Bullet lodged in officer's radio was 'police issue ammunition'

"Campaigners have warned that shoppers are being hoodwinked by organic beauty products laced with chemicals found in antifreeze, floor cleaners and engine oil . Shoppers are being hoodwinked by organic beauty products laced with chemicals found in antifreeze, floor cleaners and engine oil, campaigners warned last night. It said Boots, Nivea and other manufacturers misled the public. The Soil Association surveyed shampoos, creams and other toiletries labelled as being organic, natural or inspired by nature. Nivea was criticised for using an unofficial logo to proclaim its Pure And Natural hand cream as ’95 per cent natural’. However, the ingredients show it . contains methylisothiazolinone, a preservative found in window and floor . cleaners and air fresheners. The association said the chemical could cause cancer and is suspected of causing nerve damage. Boots Botanics – a skin care range which draws on the ‘power of plants’ – was also put under the microscope. Items . singled out included the facial oil, costing £9.99, which is labelled . as 100 per cent organic but was found to contain at least four . non-organic ingredients. US . firm Organix – a beauty company unconnected to the British baby food . manufacturer of the same name – was accused of ‘misleading marketing’. Although the brand name suggests products will be organic, its coconut shampoo does not contain any organic ingredients, and there were concerns that at least one component may cause cancer. Unlike organic food, the labelling of organic beauty products is not covered by law. However, there are voluntary certification schemes run by organisations, including the Soil Association. To qualify, certain chemicals are banned from products and all plant-based ingredients must have been grown organically. Peter Melchett, the Soil Association’s policy director, said the many companies that strive to meet the standards are being undermined by those that take shortcuts and make misleading claims. He added: ‘It is wrong that people are putting chemicals found in antifreeze, paint, oven cleaner and floor cleaner on their skin, when they thought they were buying a product made from only natural or organic ingredients. This must stop.’ The Soil Association surveyed shampoos, creams and other toiletries labelled as being organic, natural or inspired by nature . Nivea and Organix did not comment on the claims. Boots said any problems with its Botanics range were related to labelling and not the products themselves. A spokesman added: ‘The Botanics range uses the power of plants extracts with scientific formulations to create effective skin care products. We would like to reassure our customers that the ingredients in the Botanics Organic Facial Oil support a 100 per cent organic claim and Trading Standards approve our process. ‘The ingredient list on the packaging may not make this clear. We will look to rectify this immediately.’","Soil Association surveyed shampoos and creams labelled as organic .

"An 18-year-old freshman with a history of mental health problems plunged to her death last night from the 14th-floor window of a Columbia University dormitory. Martha Corey-Ochoa, a former high school valedictorian from Dobbs Ferry, New York, fell from the university residence John Jay Hall in an apparent suicide, police said. She died at nearby St Luke’s Hospital after falling from the dorm window at 11pm on the day most freshmen at the New York residence moved in. Columbia student Martha Corey-Ochoa, 18, fell to her death from a dorm window late Monday night . 'Everyone was out here seconds after it happened,' said witness Efraim Ramos, 54. 'Everyone was in the street, it was packed.' Two freshmen were the first to find the woman lying in the road and were said to be in shock after the discovery, the New York Post reported. She lived on the 14th floor of the building in a single room, police told DNAinfo.com. The gifted student claimed she enjoyed reading 'Twlight' and Dostoevsky's 'Crime and Punishment and she listed English literature and calculus as some of her interests. 'People were getting ready to go to a party but then I found out the building was sealed off and nobody was being allowed out or in,' said fellow John Jay Hall resident 19-year-old Lucas Zeppetello. 'I was in my room and nobody bothered me. I didn't even poke my head out.' She left no note and there were no witnesses, according to the Journal News. An autopsy has not been scheduled, the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner said. Miss Corey-Ochoa planned to double major in English and mathematics, she had told the Rivertowns Daily Voice in June. 'I’m not sure if I’m ready to say anything at all about my daughter,' said her father, George Ochoa, himself a graduate of Columbia . Cheryl Beer, 54, a neighbour of the family’s for 14 years who used to direct musicals at the high school, said the 'talented' and 'dedicated' girl played violin in the pit band. Her parents are writers and her mother, Melinda, has taught at Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, neighbours said. Jennifer Dawber, 52, said she recently congratulated Miss Corey-Ochoa's parents after they dropped her off at Columbia. She described the 18-year-old as kind, polite and extremely intelligent and said it seemed as though Miss Corey-Ochoa was always in the newspaper for receiving academic awards.

'Talented': The former high school valedictorian . from Dobbs Ferry, New York, fell from university residence John Jay . Hall (pictured) the day most freshmen moved in, police said . It has been reported that the high achiever had been treated for mental health issues in the past and was taking undisclosed medications. 'We are terribly saddened to tell you of the untimely death of one of our Class of 2012 graduates, Martha Corey-Ochoa,' said Dobbs Ferry schools superintendent Lisa Brady to the New York Post. 'A brilliant student and last year’s valedictorian, Martha had just begin her freshman year at Columbia University.' The brilliant student excelled at music, Spanish language, math and writing and was described as 'completely devoted' to her parents. 'She was a quiet girl, a very studious girl,' said Roberta Reynolds, a neighbour of the family. 'Whatever happened, she was not used to being away from the family. 'If she did do this, it's because she didn't want to disappoint her family. 'I don't know how the family will cope without her.' Other devastated neighbours spoke of a 'driven' student, who would have been successful in any field she had chosen. 'There was no question she was going to be successful,' said neighbour Cheryl Beer. 'Everything she did she was driven to do. 'We used to hear her playing violin when most kids were out playing.' One mother whose daughter attended the same class as Corey-Ochoa said that death of the Columbia student was 'a tragedy for the community.' 'She never said a bad word about anybody,' said Julie Lowery. 'She didn't gossip. 'She liked to go out to dinner, to go out for ice cream.' Shocking death: The woman fell from a dorm window at Columbia University (bottom), at 11pm on the day most freshmen moved in to the hall of residence . 'I'm in shock,' Ms Dawber said after learning of the death from a reporter. Selfless: The teenager would give cards to neighbours at Christmas and bake them cookies . 'I feel like she had such a great future. I hope her family can get some peace. I still can't believe it'. Roberta Reynolds, 58, a neighbour of the family's for 13 years, said their daughter, an only child, was quiet, respectful and devoted to her parents. 'Martha was their life.' The teenager baked cookies for Ms Reynolds at Christmas and gave her a card. When she was young, Ms Reynolds gave her little toys including stuffed animals and bracelets and said she often saw Martha helping her mother in the garden. 'She was a very intelligent girl, a wonderful musician, and she was very devoted to her parents. She was a very caring daughter. She was looking forward to excelling at school.' A university security officer said a paramedic and a nurse had been seen by a student running out of the hospital. 'We were walking down and we just saw her there,' the student told the officer. Dean of Student Affairs Kevin Shollenberger informed students of the death in an email sent around 2:15am, calling the death a tragedy. 'It's a time that our community needs to pull together and support one another,' Mr Shollenberger said. Tragedy: Miss Corey-Ochoa was taken to nearby St Luke's hospital and pronounced dead there . 'Our returning students should keep in mind our first-year students have just gotten here, and they are developing contacts and relationships and should be sensitive and reach out to one another.' He said religious advisers and counsellors would be on hand today to talk to students and staff. At 5.20am he sent another email revealing her name and writing: 'Martha was passionate about mathematics and literature, and recognized as a very talented writer. 'We extend our deepest condolences to the family of this student. As we continue to cope with the loss of one of our valued community members, we remain committed to ensuring the health and well being of our Columbia family.'","Two freshmen were first to find her lying in the road .

"The dead body of a 12 stone porpoise was found dumped in an alleyway - more than a mile from the coast. Mystery surrounds how the 4ft long mammal got to Tarring, just outside Worthing in Sussex, as they are banned from being kept as pets and rarely in captivity because they have difficulty adapting. The animal was found lying in its own blood on Saturday evening by passersby and experts believe its appearance in the alleyway was probably the result of a 'strange Halloween prank.' The porpoise is believed to have died after being washed up on the beach and had been dead for around two days. A porpoise was found in an alleyway in Tarring in West Sussex, more than a mile from the shore, on Saturday . The porpoise, weighing 12 stone, had to be covered with biohazard bags before it could be collected for testing . Tim Allen, 31, was told the animal had been found on Saturday evening. He said: 'It was all so surreal. How on earth did a dead dolphin end up in our alley? 'It looked like it had been dragged, but even so, that would require a lot of effort. 'We're all floundering as to who, or what, would do such a thing. It's mad.' The animal is a male harbour porpoise, which usually travel round in small groups and are traditionally hard to spot as they rarely come out of the water. From a distance they look similar to dolphins and are often found in the North Pacific, North Atlantic and Black Sea. Tarring, in West Sussex, lies around 1.2 miles from the seafront. The RSPCA has since received reports from people saying they saw the porpoise washed up on the beach. Mr Allen added: 'Nobody has a clue how it got here. We were all stood round, all bemused. One old lady reckons it was dumped there as part of a revenge attack straight out of the Godfather. 'I'm not so sure - unless you live on our estate, you wouldn't have any reason to even know that that alley exists. 'There was a little girl who saw it and looked really upset. If it was put there as a joke, it wasn't a funny joke. 'It's not a through path to anywhere but our homes. It's all so strange - if it was a cow, at least it could have got there and died on its own.' Mr Allen rang the RSPCA who sent an inspector round to examine the porpoise. They then covered the animal in yellow biohazard bags until it could be picked up on Sunday. A spokeswoman from the British Divers Marine Life Rescue programme, which helped remove the animal, said it had probably died after becoming stranded on the shore. Porpoises are banned from being kept as pets in the UK and there are no known cases of them being kept illegally, as they are very difficult to house and would need huge facilities like dolphins. The porpoise was found in Tarring in West Sussex on Saturday night - which is more than 1 mile from the sea . The dead porpoise was found dumped in the Sussex alleyway on Saturday by passerby in Tarring, Sussex . She said: 'It had been dead for a day or two, and we are putting this down to some kind of prank. It was Halloween. 'You have to bear in mind it was a 4ft animal, so probably a couple of people carried it, realised they couldn't do anything with it and dumped it. The animal had been dead two days and was decomposing badly. It was not going to be particularly pleasant and would have been pretty smelly. 'Generally most people would never have picked it up, and someone out there is likely to have some very smelly clothes.' The corpse has been taken to the Zoological Society of London, where a post-mortem will be conducted by the Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme - experts in all large marine animals who are found washed up on our shores. A spokesman from the RSPCA said: 'It is at present unclear how the animal died but it is hoped tests will provide answers to this. 'He may have died from natural causes and washed up on the beach, and then later transported inland. 'At present, we are not aware of any animal welfare issues, but are helping with ongoing enquiries as much as we can.'","Porpoise found in Tarring alleyway in Sussex, more than a mile from the sea .

"Dozens of flights have been cancelled across southern Japan after a volcano erupted for the first time in 22 years. Mount Aso, located about 625 miles southwest of Tokyo, on Kyushu island, has been blasting out chunks of magma since Friday morning, causing flight cancellations from Kumamoto, the nearest city, and prompting warnings to stay away from its crater. The volcano has been spewing out lava debris and smoke, shooting plumes of ash a kilometer (3,280 feet) into the sky, The Japan Meteorological Agency said. Scroll down for video . Eruption: Volcanic smoke billows from Mount Aso, located about 625 miles southwest of Tokyo, on the southern Kyushu island, following an eruption on Friday . Mount Aso is one of the world's largest volcanos, but the observatory do not expect the eruption to increase in scale. Eruptions by another volcano, Mount Ontake, on the central Japanese island of Honshu, in September left at least 57 dead, and a further six people remain unaccounted for. Experts say hikers near the summit might have been hit by rocks flying as fast as 190 miles per hour. Most of the ash fell in the first hour of the explosion, according to the University of Tokyo's Earthquake Research Institute. Survivors said they fled for their lives as rocks and debris rained down on them while they struggled with hot air and ash hitting their face. Seismologists have said that increased seismic activity had been detected at Ontake, one of 47 active volcanoes in Japan that are under 24-hour monitoring, but that nothing signaled such a big eruption. The death toll is the highest from a volcanic eruption in Japan's postwar history, exceeding the 43 people killed in the 1991 eruption of Mount Unzen in southern Japan. Danger: The volcano is blasting out chunks of magma in the first such eruption in 22 years, causing flight cancellations and prompting warnings to stay away from its crater . Sky high: Mount Aso had spewed out lava debris and smoke, shooting plumes of ash a kilometer (3,280 feet) into the sky .

"A team of Finnish fashion designers have created a new range of swimwear for women with one breast. A series of women who have had a mastectomy after breast cancer modelled the costumes for these stunning pictures, which are being exhibited in Finland, Sweden and Norway. The project, titled Monokini 2.0, aims to re-examine the public’s view of what women, beauty and physical appearance. Body beautiful: The Monokini 2.0 project was inspired by Elina Halttunen, pictured here, a breast cancer sufferer who had a mastectomy . Gorgeous: Virve models a Monokini swimming costume.

Whilst . a large number of women chose to opt for reconstructive surgery after a . mastectomy, many, like Elina, chose to have just one breast and embrace . their new body. Elina went shopping, but could not find suitable . swimwear for her shape. Inspiring: 'Cancer has drilled holes to my bones and taken away my breast,' says Marjaana, posing here in a velvet dress.

"Firemen were called to a house fire that broke out after a mechanical cleaning gadget somehow switched itself on and destroyed itself by moving onto a kitchen hotplate. Local media in Austria have referred to the incident as 'robot suicide' and even suggested it was fed up with the constant cleaning it had to do. Fireman Helmut Kniewasser was one of those called to tackle the blaze at Hinterstoder in Kirchdorf, Austria. Did he blow a fuse? The remains of the cleaning robot that destroyed itself on a cooking hob . He said: 'The home-owner had put the small robot on the work surface to clean up some spilled cereal. Once the robot had done its job it was switched off but left on the kitchen sideboard. 'The 44-year-old house owner, together with his wife and son, then left the house and were not home when the robot set off. 'Somehow it seems to have reactivated itself and made its way along the work surface where it pushed a cooking pot out of the way and basically that was the end of it. 'It pretty quickly started to melt underneath and then stuck to the kitchen hotplate. It then caught fire. By the time we arrived, it was just a pile of ash.

'The entire building had to be evacuated and there was severe smoke damage particularly in the flat where the robot had been in use. 'I don't know about the allegations of a robot suicide but the homeowner is insistent that the device was switched off - it's a mystery how it came to be activated and ended up making its way to the hotplate.' It took an hour to clean and make the building safe. But the family at least for the moment is homeless as their apartment is no longer habitable thanks to the smoke damage. The homeowner said: 'The company that makes the robots is selling dangerous devices, I intend to sue to get compensation. It has ruined my home as everything is smoke damaged.'","Local media in Austria speculated it was a 'suicide bid' from the robot .

"They are already at risk from oil spills, hunting and habitat destruction. Now scientists say that decompression sickness, also known as the bends, can be a killer for endangered sea turtles. The sickness has been diagnosed for the first time in loggerhead sea turtles and creatures that are accidentally caught in fishing nets are most likely to suffer, experts say. Decompresion sickness, or 'the bends' has been diagnosed for the first time in loggerhead sea turtles (stock picture) and creatures caught in fishing nets by accident, are most likely to suffer, experts say . The bends is caused by the formation of nitrogen bubbles in the blood and tissues following a sudden drop in surrounding pressure, such as when a diver rapidly ascends from a deep dive, or a turtle is pulled quickly from the depths. In humans, it can produce many symptoms from joint pain to paralysis and death, but it is not known what animals feel. A team of international scientists including experts from the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) diagnosed the sickness, which was previously thought to only occur in humans and some whale and dolphin species that have ascended too quickly from diving. Sea turtles are often caught accidentally in commercial fishing nets and those that appear to be active are usually released immediately back to sea. Sea turtles are often caught accidentally in commercial fishing nets and those that appear to be active are usually released immediately back to sea. But some live turtles may die from the beds upon release. A stock image of a green turtles tangled in a net is pictured . Loggerhead turtles are the most abundant of all marine species. But their population is declining due to pollution, shrimp trawling and the development of their nesting areas. The species has been on the threatened species list since 1978. They can be found in colder waters around the world but prefer costal habitats. Loggerheads has large heads, strong jaws and a reddish-brown shell. Adults can reach three feet long (one metre) and weigh 250lbs (113kg) They feed on jellyfish, crabs and fish as well as seaweed. Adult females swim thousands of miles to the beach where they were born to lay their eggs. They have an average lifespan of 50 years and have a top speed of 15mp (24kph). This study, published in the journal Diseases of Aquatic Organisms, suggests that some live turtles, while appearing initially active, possibly have the bends and may die following release. ‘This is the first time that the bends has been confirmed in a marine reptile,’ Dr Paul Jepson, co-author of the study and marine vet at ZSL said. ‘It also shows that endangered sea turtles accidentally caught in fishing nets are at risk of dying, even if they initially appear to be still alive when brought up to the sea surface. ‘Ideally we want to avoid sea turtles being caught in commercial fishing activities but, if they are, I hope that this research will make fisheries more vigilant about unintentionally catching sea turtles and the risks of decompression sickness from rapid ascent.’ In the study, 29 sea turtles accidentally caught in commercial fishing nets off the coast of Spain were found to suffer from the bends. Two of the creatures were treated with human recompression protocols carried out at Oceanographic in Valencia, and responded well. They were subsequently released back into the Mediterranean Sea. The findings have direct implications for the conservation of sea turtles, because many more may die as a result of commercial fishing activities than previously thought. Marine turtle populations are declining in the Mediterranean Sea, and six out of seven sea turtle species are endangered worldwide. Divers can avoid the bends by making safety stops and ascending gradually at a pace of less than 10 metres a minute (stock image) Decompression sickness, or the bends, is caused by the formation of nitrogen bubbles in the blood and tissues following a sudden drop in the surrounding pressure, such as when a diver rapidly ascends from a deep dive. Nitrogen makes up 70 per cent of the air we breathe and during a dive, large amounts of the gas are taken into the body’s tissues, because the diver - or animal - is breathing at a higher pressure than if they were at the surface. The quantities of dissolved nitrogen depend on the depth and length of the dive, NetDoctor reported. The deeper and longer the dive, the more nitrogen is taken up by the body. As a diver begins the journey to the water’s surface, the surrounding pressure falls and nitrogen is exhaled. But if they ascend too quickly, the gas forms bubbles in the blood and tissue. This can be avoided by making safety stops and ascending gradually at a pace of less than 32ft (10metres) a minute. In humans, the bends can produce symptoms including severe pains in the joints and chest, skin irritation, cramps, and paralysis, which can lead to death. It is not known what animals feel. It is treated with pure oxygen and fluid at the site of the accident. Later, a diver may have to sit in a decompression chamber - a steel tank that's pressurised. Lasting for around six hours, the pressure inside the chamber is increased to correspond to the pressure found some 59 ft (18metres) or more, under water and then gradually reduced again until the diver reaches surface pressure. The bends is caused by the formation of nitrogen bubbles in the blood and tissues following a sudden drop in the surrounding pressure, such as when a diver rapidly ascends from a deep dive, or a turtle is pulled quickly from the depths. Humans are treated in decompression chambers (pictured)","A team of international scientists including experts from the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) made the discovery .

The correct answer to the question should be the tail of a langoustine — also known as the Dublin Bay prawn. It’s the tasty, smaller crustacean cousin of the lobster, which is caught by trawlers in the North Sea, the Irish Sea and off Scotland’s west coast. Not once in a Google search on the contents of scampi should the response ‘pangasius catfish’ appear. But that, shockingly, is what a lot of ‘scampi’ actually is. The Mail can reveal that DNA tests carried out earlier this year on a number of scampi products found that more than one in five contained flesh from this cheap, imported fish. Bred in sprawling aquatic farms in Vietnam and Thailand, these metre-long, 40-kilogram beasts are largely devoid of taste but are used to bulk out the langoustine tails. The two are mixed together with water and a cocktail of other ingredients, and the resulting greyish lumps of matter entombed in a breadcrumb coating — before being packaged and sold as ‘scampi bites’. The amount of langoustine in these products can be as little as seven per cent, while the fish used to bulk it out — pangasius, hake, pollock or some other white fish — will often be more than five times that. While the companies behind these products say they give consumers the chance to experience a ‘scampi taste’ at a budget price, most who buy and eat them are totally oblivious to what they actually contain. Even those who stick to the more expensive ‘wholetail scampi’ products — each made from an individual langoustine tail — are unlikely to be getting much bang for their buck, since each individual piece of breaded scampi contains little more than 40 per cent langoustine. The rest is made up of the outside coating and of water. Indeed, tests have shown that some of them contain more water than actual langoustine. Served in the basket with a stack of chips, scampi become a popular pub dish in the 1970s . ‘Scampi can be one of the very worst examples of how the food industry cons us,’ says Joanna Blythman, an investigative journalist and author of six books which have lifted the lid on the realities of our food chain. ‘Manufacturers use the name scampi, with all its connotations of up-market deluxe langoustines, to sell a mulch of lowest-grade fish and additives bound in a greasy, thick, breaded jacket. ‘I never eat scampi, and would advise people to avoid it. It’s the worst sort of processed food, and rotten value for money.’ Introduced by Young’s Seafood, the UK’s leading frozen food manufacturer, after World War II as a way to use the langoustines caught by trawlermen in search of white fish, by the 1970s scampi and chips had become a favourite pub meal, served ‘in the basket’. Scampi nowdays, however, is far from simple. As part of a code of practice drawn up by the food industries in 1998, three pages of A4 are dedicated to how scampi sold in shops should be described. The code stipulates a single, coated langoustine tail should be described as ‘single wholetail scampi’. If it is made from a number of smaller pieces of scampi stuck together, it should be described as ‘formed pieces of scampi’. ‘Extended’ means it has been made from minced scampi, or with the addition of ‘prawns, white fish or textured vegetable proteins’. These food labelling regulations apply only to food packaged and sold to consumers and catering outlets. Pubs and restaurants can use any description they like. In the supermarket, a packet of Young’s Jumbo Whole Scampi can be bought for £6 for 220 g (£27.28 a kilo). Described as ‘clusters of whole scampi in breadcrumbs with added water’, the ingredients list a scampi content of 41 per cent. While this is typical of a premium product, it still means that when the water is taken into account, the actual langoustine content is well under half of the whole. Real thing: Scampi is traditionally made from the tails of langoustines, also known as Dublin Bay Prawns . For those wanting to spend less, there are much cheaper options. A 450g pack of Yorkshire Scampi Bites costs £2.65 — but a close look at the ingredients reveals that this product contains just seven per cent scampi. The main ingredient, at 30 per cent, is minced hake. A similar scampi content is found in Whitby Sea Foods Breaded Scampi Bites, available via online retailer Ocado, at £1.50 for 250g, and both Sainsbury’s and Tesco sell versions of scampi bites, both at £1.49 for 235g. The Tesco Everyday Value Scampi Bites contain 16 per cent scampi, alongside 15 per cent Alaskan pollock, as well as water and a list of ingredients so long it bears repeating in full:Scampi and white fish blend with added water (43 per cent), vegetable oil, wheat flour, water, maize flour, dextrose [a type of sugar], yeast, xylose [another type of sugar], wheat gluten, fish powder, wheat starch, sugar, raising agent (sodium carbonate), white pepper, ascorbic acid, anti caking agent silicon dioxide (this encourages ingredients to mix together well). The ‘scampi and white fish blend with added water’ is detailed as follows: scampi (16 per cent), Alaskan pollock (15 per cent), water, salt, pea fibre, pea starch, disodium diphosphate [an agent that helps food retain colour], potassium carbonate. Slim Dinsdale, an independent consultant to the food industry, describes how a product such as this might be put together. ‘The fish mixture would typically be put into a blender and mixed to a point where you would end up with a product which would retain a bit of texture but would have a basically paste-like consistency,’ he says. ‘It would then be extruded into whatever size and shape you want: it might be a ribbon that you could chop up into pieces, or just blobs. These would then be breaded and probably flash-fried. History: Scampi was introduced by Young¿s Seafood, the UK¿s leading frozen food manufacturer, after World War II as a way to use the langoustines caught by trawlermen in search of white fish . ‘It contains some scampi and fish, and the rest of the stuff is there to assist the structure, presentation and bulking-out. ‘The water is essential to keep it succulent, and a lot of the other ingredients, such as the fish powder and the disodium diphosphate, are there to hang on to the added water and stop the product disintegrating when it is cooked.’ Given the small amount of scampi in the product, is it even fair to describe it as scampi? Fiona Wright specialises in regulation at Seafish, a body set up to support the seafood industry and the interests of consumers. She says the term ‘scampi bites’ is not covered by the industry’s code of practice, and that there is no minimum limit set as to how little scampi they can contain. ‘Scampi Bites is a common marketing name for scampi and white fish coated in breadcrumbs,’ Fiona says. ‘This is the marketing name, not the legal name. ‘Legal names must be sufficiently descriptive to be able to distinguish the product from others with which it may be confused. This can be a lengthy and not very consumer friendly description, so it is often found above the ingredients panel.’ Sure enough, the Tesco packaging states: ‘Scampi fish bites formed from pieces of scampi and white fish coated in a crispy breadcrumb.’ Fiona Wright adds: ‘I have been asked to look at scampi bite labelling in the past, and in my opinion it is not misleading. The packaging does reflect its lower quality, and the pictures and descriptions were accurate.’ When I asked Tesco why their scampi bites had so many ingredients and so little scampi, a spokesman replied: ‘Our Scampi Bites are a mixture of scampi and white fish, as is made clear on the packaging. ‘To ensure our customers have a wide range to choose from, we have a selection of other scampi products which contain only scampi. All our food is clearly labelled, so our customers can make informed choices about what they eat.’ It is clear that many scampi bites sold are a long way from a fresh langoustine tail dipped in breadcrumbs and lightly fried — and nowhere is that better illustrated than in the distance travelled by some of the fish used to bulk them out. Earlier this year, Professor Mariani Stefano, a biologist at the University of Salford, tested the DNA of samples of frozen scampi bites. Of the nine tested, two were found to contain pangasius. ‘Pangasius is cheap,’ he says. ‘Often sold under the name river cobbler, it is currently on sale at Asda for £8.33 per kilo, compared with £13.92 for cod.’ There is another reason why pangasius works well in scampi bites. Professor Stefano is a keen chef and recently bought some to try. He explains: ‘It is actually incredibly bland, with almost no flavour at all. But it is like white rice: you put a sauce on it and make it taste of whatever you want.’ The presence of Vietnamese fish in that most British of foodstuffs will doubtless seem incongruous to many — but then so will many of the other ingredients, too.","More than 1 in 5 scampi products were found to contain pangasius catfish .

"Two dresses worn by Diana, Princess of Wales which were bought for nearly £130,000 yesterday will be displayed to the public for years to come. The gowns, part of an auction of 10 of the princess's dresses yesterday, were bought by the charity Historic Royal Palaces, which runs Kensington Palace, Diana's former residence. And the palace is hoping to display at least one of the new dresses in an exhibition this summer alongside other items from their Royal Ceremonial Dress Collection. Two dresses worn by Diana, Princess of Wales will be displayed to the public after being purchased by the Historic Royal Palaces charity yesterday.  The charity paid £78,000 for this Catherine Walker gown . To avoid damage, the garments will not go on permanent display but will periodically be shown to the public in exhibitions, a spokeswoman said. The charity spent £50,400 on a Bruce Oldfield black velvet evening gown, worn for an official portrait by Lord Snowdon and at the gala opening of Les Miserables at the Barbican Centre in 1985. They also purchased a pink sequinned crepe dress by Catherine Walker, worn on a state visit to Brazil in 1991, for £78,000. The garments were originally sold, with a number of others, by Diana herself following her divorce from the Prince of Wales to raise money for charity at the suggestion of Prince William. While the star lot of the sale at Kerry Taylor Auctions in London sold for £240,000, the auctioneer said she was particularly pleased about the sales to the palace. The Bruce Oldfield black velvet evening gown that Princess Diana wore at the gala opening of Les Miserables at the Barbican centre in 1985 sold for £50,400 at the Kerry Taylor auction . Kerry Taylor said: It's important for the generations to come. 'Diana was the people's princess, so the people should be able to see these dresses. This is our heritage, our history.' A Historic Royal Palaces spokeswoman said: ""We are delighted to confirm independent charity Historic Royal Palaces purchased two dresses from the sale of dresses worn by Diana, Princess of Wales at Kerry Taylor Auctions yesterday. 'The dresses will remain in the UK to become part of our permanent Royal Ceremonial Dress Collection, conserving them for future generations and ensuring that visitors to Kensington Palace will be able to see these unique items for years to come. An employee poses for photographers with the Victor Edelstein evening gown at the Kerry Taylor auction house in London . 'The dresses are important examples of the work of two designers the princess chose on many occasions. 'The princess wore the black velvet Bruce Oldfield evening gown in a well-known formal portrait by Lord Snowdon. 'She wore the ivory silk crepe evening gown decorated with pink sequins by Catherine Walker during a state visit to Brazil. 'The two dresses mark the evolution of the princess's style from the romanticism of the mid-1980s to the sleek and sophisticated silhouettes of the early 1990s.' She added that the charity hoped at least one of the new dresses would go on display in an exhibition at Kensington Palace this summer. The show will feature dresses worn by the Queen, Princess Margaret and Diana. Under the hammer: Bidding begins at Kerry Taylor Auctions in London this afternoon .

"The father of a young man who lost both his legs after Monday's bomb blasts only discovered his son was hurt when he saw his picture on the TV news. Jeff Bauman Sr had been desperately trying to contact his son, Jeff Bauman Jr, when he took a call from his anguished step-daughter asking: 'Did you see the picture?' Mr Bauman, 52, then turned on the TV news to see the ashen face of his son, who was being wheeled away from the site of the blast with a horrifically injured lower leg. Horrified, he then rang around local hospitals in a desperate bid to find 27-year-old Jeff, who had been at the Boston marathon to cheer on his girlfriend. Scroll down for videos . Help: The speed of first responders and volunteers on the scene helped save lives, like that of Jeff Bauman who was seriously injured in one of the blasts . The picture he saw that confirmed that his son was dead has become an iconic image of Monday's atrocities which left three dead and more than 180 injured. It shows his burnt, bloodied and maimed son being pushed by first responders in a wheelchair while another man in a cowboy hat - who it later transpired had saved his life - helped stem the blood loss. Mr Bauman spoke of his family's shock as doctors treating the injured said they hoped there would be no further deaths as a result of the bombs. Medics at hospitals across Boston who are treating the casualties said they had seen head injuries, broken bones, and limb amputations. Jeffrey Bauman Sr spent an hour calling his son's cellphone before seeing his picture on the news and learning that he was hurt . They also had to deal with children with nails sticking out of their bodies as a result of the explosives hidden in bags near the race finish line. Injured Mr Bauman Jr, who works at Costco and is planning to go back to school when he has paid off his student loans, was at the race to cheer on his girlfriend Erin Hurley, who was running her first Boston Marathon. His father said he rang his son's cellphone the minute he heard about the bombs, but despite repeated calls over an hour, he got no answer. Then his step-daughter Erika rang him and asked: 'Did you see the picture?' Mr Bauman Sr shouted: 'Are you sure?  Are you sure?', the New York Times reports.  His step-daughter said she was sure as she had seen his picture on the news. Mr Bauman Sr turned on his TV and internet to be confronted with the graphic evidence that confirmed his son was seriously injured. The picture he found was not the whole picture, which showed in horrifying detail how the younger Mr Bauman had had one leg torn off at the knee, but a cropped version as shown above. Later he posted the picture on his Facebook account, with the simple comment: 'Here is the photo that I saw on the news'. Runners continue to race towards the finishing line at Boston Marathon as an explosion erupts on the sidewalk . His horrified father than rang around local hospitals in a desperate bid to find the son who was obviously badly wounded.  When he found his son was at Boston Medical Center he and his wife Csilla left their home in Conchord, N.H. and reached the hospital at 8pm. Mr Bauman Sr was told his son had already had both legs amputated at the knee, and had to be resuscitated and given blood several times during surgery because he had lost so much blood. His father learnt he had been the first casualty to arrive at the center, and discovered that the young man probably owed his surviving the attacks to the man in the cowboy hat in the photograph with him. Carlos Arredondo, who was handing out American flags to spectators when the bombs went off, has been credited with saving Jeff Bauman Jr's life . Costa Rican immigrant Carlos Arredondo, 52, leapt into action when he saw Mr Bauman Jr lying horrifically injured by the blasts. He jumped over a fence, ran towards Mr Bauman Jr and hauled him into a wheelchair before tying a shirt around one leg to act as a tourniquet and pinching his femoral artery to stem blood-loss while two emergency responders wheeled the injured young man to an ambulance. Mr Bauman Sr was told the man, who lost his Marine son Alexander in Iraq in 2004, had saved his son's life. Jeff Bauman Jr, pictured right, is being treated at Boston Medical Center after having both legs amputated at the knee . Jeff Bauman Jr was watching his girlfriend run her first Boston Marathon when he was badly injured by the explosions at the finishing line . That night, as he waited for his son to have further surgery to drain a fluid build-up caused by the trauma, he wrote on his Facebook page: 'Can everyone pray for my Son Jeff jr who was at the finish line today in Boston. He is in surgery right now with injuries to his legs. I just can't explain whats wrong with people today to do this to people. I'm really starting to lose faith in our country.' Meanwhile, doctors treating the injured at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) said they were confident no further lives would be lost as a result of Monday's bombs. Trauma surgeon Dr George Velmahos told a press conference: 'I am confident that no further lives will be lost.  Overall (it’s) an optimistic message at this point.' He said the hospital has a total of six or seven patients who are still in critical condition, but added that some of them were awake and their conditions had significantly improved since yesterday morning. He said doctors there had performed four amputations so far, with two further patients at risk of needing amputations. Fox News reported that most of the bombing victims suffered from traumatic injuries to their lower extremities, according to trauma surgeons at Massachusetts General Hospital, where 31 victims were treated. Doctors said they removed sharp, metal objects from children and adults injured by the explosions. More than 170 people were hurt by the blasts, with injuries including broken bones, amputated limbs and head injuries. Dr David Mooney, director of the trauma center at Boston Children's Hospital, said: 'We've removed BBs and we've removed nails from kids. On-duty: Emergency responders comfort a woman on a stretcher who was injured in the Boston explosions . 'One of the sickest things for me was just to see nails sticking out of a little girl's body.' Two children remain in critical condition at the hospital with serious leg injuries. Dr Mooney said that tourniquets applied by emergency responders at the race saved the children's lives. Doctors at MGH said they removed metal fragments from victims of the two bombs. Stephen Epstein of the emergency medicine department at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre said he saw an X-ray of one victim's leg that had 'what appears to be small, uniform, round objects throughout it - similar in the appearance to BBs.'","Jeff Bauman Sr spent an hour calling son's cell when he heard bomb news .

"Tips on how to make tea or coffee and fry bacon are among the recipes in a cookbook for WWI soldiers that has been published for the first time in 100 years. Hundreds of thousands of young men who had never been near an oven or kettle in their lives were given the guide when they headed off to war in 1914. But the British Army Cook Book didn't just show how to cook simpler items, it also provided tips on how to stretch the meagre wartime rations into meals like beef curry and toad-in-the-hole for an entire platoon. Young soldiers were armed with the British Army Cook Book on their way to war. Recipes showed how to stretch meagre wartime rations into proper meals. Many men had never cooked before in their lives. In the left picture, a group of WW1 soldiers are given a desert cookery lesson. In the right picture, a WW1 soldier cooks his evening meal . Each soldier was allowed 10 ounces of meat and eight ounces of vegetables a day and frontline 'chefs' were expected to provide tasty and nutritious meal with these small amounts. Recipe suggestions in the book include  roast meat and Yorkshire puddings, Irish stew, meat pie, Turkish pilau and various soups. There is even a section dedicated to deserts with entries like jam rolls, bread and butter pudding and treacle tarts. The dishes might sound tempting but in reality those on the frontlines would have had to rely more on powdered foods because fresh produce often took too long to reach them. The cookbook was first launched in 1910, four years before war against Germany broke out . Like an idiots' guide to cooking, the book instructed soldiers how to make coffee and tea in war zones and explains the various ways of cooking food, from roasting to frying . The cookbook included a guide to the various vegetables sent to troops, with instructions on how to prepare them and what to serve them with. It notes 'carrots should always be sent up to table with boiled beef' and suggests boiling onions so that they are 'deprived of much of their pungent, volatile oil'.

The dishes in the recipe book might sound tempting but in reality those on the frontlines would have had to rely more on powdered foods because fresh produce often took too long to reach them . The 1914 British Army Cook Book has been printed by Amberley Publishing for the first time since it was first issued 100 years ago. It is on sale now for £9.99. Hazel Cochrane, from Amberley, said: 'The original manuscript dates from 1910 and was published by the British War Office prior to the war, following the establishment of the Army School of Cookery in Aldershot in 1885. 'This may have been as a consequence of changing attitudes to soldiers' diets nearing the end of the nineteenth century. 'There was an increasing recognition that a well-fed solider was a long-term investment that produced better results on the battlefield.' The 1914 British Army Cook Book has been printed by Amberley Publishing for the first time since it was first issued 100 years ago. It was produced by the Army School of Cookery, which had been set up in Aldershot, Hants, in 1885 . She continued: 'Changes to soldiers' diets included an increase in the allowance of fresh meat and bread that was allocated to soldiers at the beginning of the century . 'It was an attitude reflected in the meat stew recipes and tips on producing fresh bread. 'The cookery school was represented by soldiers taken from around the country, who were trained to make the best of the uncompromising conditions of the battlefield. Biscuit Pudding: . Ingredients for 60 men: 10lbs biscuit crumbs, 4lbs flour, 3lbs sugar, 3lbs suet, 41 tablespoons lemon or lime juice, pinch of salt . Method: Thoroughly dry the biscuits, then crush with a rolling pin. Soak in cold water for about 15 minutes. Remove all skin from the suet, then chop very fine. Add the flour, sugar, salt and lime juice to the soaked biscuits. Stir well together with sufficient water to make a stiff paste. Grease some basins and boil or bake until done. Time allowed for cooking depends on the size of the pudding. Fried bacon: . Cut the bacon into thin slices, trim away the rusty part and cut off the rind. Put into a cold frying pan, that is to say, do not place the pan on the fire before the bacon is in it. Turn it two or three times and dish it on a very hot dish, poach some eggs and slip them on to the bacon without breaking the yolk and serve quickly. 'This included how best to keep fires alight through the incessant wind and rain of war as making tea and coffee in adverse weather conditions was not an easy feat. 'There was a heavy reliance on meat and bread in the British Army and meals were not varied, with vegetables often consisting of just potatoes. 'Despite the promise of fresh meat and bread that the changes proposed, a soldier's diet may have varied depending on where they were stationed.' Each soldier was allowed 10 ounces of meat and eight ounces of vegetables a day and frontline 'chefs' were expected to provide tasty and nutritious meal with these small amounts . The cookbook included a guide to the various vegetables sent to troops, with instructions on how to prepare them and what to serve them with . She continued: 'It is certainly true that a better diet was possible away from the front line, where foraging through the French countryside was possible, but those on the front line did receive the most amount of food. 'Those stationed on the Front Line received an allowance of 4,193 calories daily, while those further back in the lines of communication were allocated 3,472 calories per day. 'The recipes in the book focus on making the most of what soldiers had, something relevant to modern-day families feeling the pinch of the recent recession. 'Something can be learnt though from recipes with a heavy reliance on cheap cuts of meat and easy to grow vegetables that had to last through harsh winters. 'An interesting feature of army cooking highlighted in the book is that the meat from fat was extracted to make dripping, which was used as an aid for frying and in the absence of butter, an example of how important it was to use every aspect of the meagre supplies provided.'

"He's back! Disgraced ex-Congressman Anthony Weiner is once again trolling around on Twitter — the same social media platform where he destroyed his political career. This time, the married father chose as a 'favorite' pic a shot of a scantily-clad woman who goes by the name of Joslyn Stevens , of 'SugarFuzz' on Twitter, Gawker reported. On the microblogging site, Stevens' bio reads: 'Filling in for your wife since 2001. Indulge your sexual fantasies by having an affair.' Scroll down for video . Oops: Anthony Weiner didn't learn much from the sexting scandal that cost his political career. He's once again perusing attractive young women's Twitter accounts and publicly marking their pictures as 'favorites' Target: Joslyn Stevens is the woman whose picture Weiner favorited on Twitter . The married Weiner in 2011 was caught in a sexting scandal that forced him to resign from Congress. Then he went on to launch a failed bid for mayor of New York City last year — while he was still sexting with women. His most notable sexting partner, Sydney Leathers, has gone on to become a porn actress and once bragged about exchanging dates and sexual acts with sugar daddies for money, MailOnline reported exclusively. Last week, Weiner told Politico his 'political career is probably over' but wouldn't say if he still exchanges saucy messages with women. His wife, Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin, has stood by his side. This is not the first this happens. Weiner once favorited a a tweet declaring 'Tinder will now be the ultimate sext machine.' And he once favorited sexy photos of a California woman who went by the name of 'ParisDylan550' on Twitter. Weiner's wife, Huma Abedin, has stood by his side despite his inability to keep it in his pants . Weiner's sexting partner, Sydney Leathers, sits at Connolly's Pub in New York waiting for the disgraced politician to give his concession speech after having lost the mayoral primaries . Back then, Weiner said: 'There were a bunch of favorites there that I either didn't recognize or mean to favorite. 'I'm not clear on how they got marked in the first place but I assume I hit the little star thing accidentally as I scrolled through stuff.' The favorite has since been removed from Weiner's Twitter account. Stevens seems to be enjoying her five minutes of fame. 'I’m not upset but I do love weiners,' she tweeted about being dragged into the media spotlight.","The disgraced politician is back to the social media website that cost him his congressional career .

"They may not be able to talk, but babies as young as seven months are able to subconsciously recognise fear in someone’s eyes, new research claims. Infants can read human expressions by looking at the whites of the eyes - or sclerae - in split seconds. And they seem to react more in response to fear, than happiness, according to the study. Infants can read human expressions by looking at the whites of the eyes - or sclerae –in split seconds, according to a new study. And they seem to react more (stock image) in response to fear, than happiness . Scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig conducted EEG (electroencephalography) tests, which involved babies wearing a skull cap fitted with electrodes. In the first experiment, 24 babies undergoing the tests were shown images of eyes without any other facial features, either reacting fearfully or showing happiness. The activity in the babies’ brains changed more in response to fear than happiness. A pair of fearful or surprised eyes (stock image) has larger whites than eyes showing other emotions, such as happiness, when they tend to show the smallest amount of white. The study claims that babies read this cue in just 50 milliseconds and react to fear stronger than happiness . Sclerae are the whites of human eyes. Experts believe they evolved as a communication aid to allow humans to see where other people were looking, because direction is linked to emotional states. Women’s brains have more hardwiring than men’s to read emotions and one consequence is that women have more white in their eyes than men. The study reveals that babies subconsciously recognise fear in someone's eyes by looking at the sclerae for under 50 milliseconds. A pair of fearful or surprised eyes has larger whites than eyes showing other emotions, such as happiness, when they tend to show the smallest amount of white. We are the only primates to have sclerae. For example, apes' are completely dark. Apes' lack of sclerae mean that their prey doesn’t know where they are looking or whether they have been spotted - giving the creatures a greater chance of hunting success. The same result was seen in a second experiment when 22 babies were shown sclerae when the gaze was direct rather than averted. In each experiment, the images were presented for just 50 milliseconds, which is beyond the threshold of conscious perception, according to the study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. A pair of fearful or surprised eyes has larger whites than eyes showing other emotions, such as happiness, when they tend to show the smallest amount of white. It is thought that the human eye’s prominent white sclera is important in social interactions. While scientists have previously found evidence for brain mechanisms that allow for the unconscious detection of eye cues in adults, they didn’t know how early in development this ability emerges - until now. ‘The current study provides neural evidence for the unconscious detection of emotion and gaze cues from the sclera in seven month-old infants,’ said Dr Sarah Jessen, of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences. ‘Our findings demonstrate the existence of fast, efficient and reliable social cue detection mechanisms in the human infant brain that likely provide a vital foundation for the development of social interactive skills.’ Scientists from of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig conducted EEG (electroencephalography) tests, which involved babies wearing a skull cap fitted with electrodes. This stock image shows a four-year-old girl having an EEG test, with her brain activity shown on the screen . Humans are the only primates that have sclerae. For example, apes’ are completely dark. Experts believe that the white of the eye evolved as a communication aid to allow humans to see where other people were looking, because direction is linked to emotional states. Women’s brains have more hardwiring than men’s to read emotions and one consequence of this is that women have more white in their eyes than men. While apes may miss out on this extra communication tool, their lack of sclerae mean that their prey doesn’t know where they are looking or whether they have been spotted - giving the creatures a greater chance of hunting success.

"A routine stand-up paddleboard session unexpectedly turned into a giant turtle rescue mission on Friday morning. Lifeguard Kasey Andrews was instructing the class at Wild Cattle Creek, near Gladstone - north of Brisbane, when she noticed what looked like a fin in the distance. Once she established the fin wasn't a shark and was in fact a green turtle, Ms Andrews was determined to bring it to safety. But it was her remarkable quick-thinking and improvised rescue technique - where she dove in after the struggling turtle and dragged it onto her board before paddling to shore - which saved the injured sea creature's life. Kasey Andrews (pictured) was instructing a stand-up paddleboard class when she saw the turtle in Wild Cattle Creek, near Gladstone, north of Brisbane . Ms Andrews and friend Gina Murphy (right) rescued the turtle, named Earl, by dragging it onto a board and paddling to shore . Ms Andrews - who runs Beach Paddles Tannum Sands - says she spotted the poor turtle, named Earl, tangled in a crab pot near a popular local fishing spot. 'All of a sudden I seen a float bobbing up and down near the creek mouth then what looked like a fin,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I was a little cautious to get closer, in case it was a shark then it came up for a gasp of breath and showed it was a turtle.' Ms Andrews called her nearby friend Gina Murphy over for help. 'Quick Gina, quick Gina - we have to rescue this!' Ms Andrews recalled yelling. 'Gina and I both decided the only way we were going to save this fella was to launch ourselves at him. But the ordeal took half an hour, as the turtle was a fast swimmer - albeit injured. 'Gina and I weren't going anywhere, we were determined to get him as he was struggling more and more for air,' Ms Andrews said. 'Then he came up for another breath and I dove straight in after him. Diving very deep, I pulled the attached rope down until I had hold of his huge shell and he continued deeper. 'All I can remember is looking up and seeing the sun shining on the water above thinking, I've got to come up for air, then all of a sudden the turtle flew back up to surface for another breath.' The two friends will be visiting Earl next week, at the Quoin Island Turtle Rehabilitation Centre, which is when he is due to be released . Friends Ms Andrews and Ms Murphy in the midst of the turtle rescue mission on Friday morning . Ms Andrews then yelled for her friend to bring the board over as they struggled to hoist the turtle onto the flotation device. 'We both had a fin each and tried tirelessly to pull him onto board but no go,' she said. 'Then I decided to jump on board behind him, Gina stayed beside the turtle and we waited for a wave. As the wave hit us we both tried to haul turtle on bit by bit and centre him. We were exhausted, us and the poor turtle. It took 15 minutes to try and free Earl from the crab pot line he was entangled in. 'Gina and I both looked at each other nearly crying with excitement and both agreed that we couldn't let him go, as his fin was damaged pretty bad,' Ms Andrews said. The crab pot (pictured) in the local fishing spot that trapped the giant injured turtle . So they persisted until they were able to untie him from the line. 'It was a mission and a half,' Ms Andrews said. 'I think everything that I have learnt from board rescue in lifesaving helped me for this, we wiggled the turtle up the board a little and I lay behind our dear friend while Gina swam beside the board helping me hold him on.' Once they hit the shore, the pair covered Earl in wet towels and called the Quoin Island Turtle Rehabilitation Centre straight away. With the help of several bystanders, they were able to lift the giant turtle onto the back of a ute and drove him to meet rehab staff at the centre in Gladstone. Ms Andrews says she plans on visiting her turtle friend at the rehabilitation centre next week, which is when he's due to be released. 'I guess its something you don't do every day - but it was very rewarding to be part of something so special,' she said.","Kasey Andrews was instructing a paddleboard class when she saw the turtle in Wild Cattle Creek, near Gladstone, north of Brisbane .

"It may not be the first material that springs to mind when thinking about batteries, but experts have created a highly-conductive film using clay. Called ‘conductive MXene clay’, the scientists found that not only does it have the same conductivity as many metals, it can also be easily moulded into a variety of shapes and sizes. This makes it ideal for being fitted inside curved smartwatches, tiny sensors and other unusually-shaped devices. Scroll down for video . Called 'conductive MXene clay’, the scientists found that not only does it have the same conductivity as many metals, it can also be easily moulded. This makes it ideal for being fitted inside curved smartwatches, tiny sensors and other unusually-shaped devices. The material is pictured completing a circuit to power a fan . Experts from Drexel University’s College of Engineering, who designed the clay, said the breakthrough represents a turn away from the complicated and expensive processing of current lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors. ‘Both the physical properties of the clay, as well as its performance, seem to make it an exceptionally viable candidate for use in energy storage devices,’ said lead researcher Professor Yury Gogotsi. ‘The procedure to make the clay also uses much safer, readily available ingredients than the ones we used to produce MXene electrodes in the past.’ The discovery was made when Michael Ghidiu, a doctoral student in the Department of Materials Science Engineering at Drexel, was testing a new method for making MXenes. MXenes are two-dimensional materials, invented at Drexel, designed to be used in next-generation batteries and supercapacitors. MXenes are two-dimensional materials designed to be used in next-generation batteries. The original process uses toxic hydrofluoric acid, but the chemists instead used a fluoride salt and hydrochloric acid to take aluminum out of a titanium-based, layered ceramic material called a MAX phase (process pictured) The original process uses toxic hydrofluoric acid, but Mr Ghidiu instead used a fluoride salt and hydrochloric acid to take aluminum out of a titanium-based, layered ceramic material called a MAX phase. These two ingredients are much safer to handle than hydrofluoric acid, and turned the MAX phase to a pile of black particles. To stop the reaction and remove any residual chemicals, Mr Ghidiu washed the material in water. But, rather than finding the layered MXene particles, he discovered that the sediment absorbed the water to form a clay-like material. An electron microscopic study of the clay particles in water revealed it is made up of single layers of MXene about a nanometre - just a few atoms - thick. This thin structure indicates that researchers are likely to find the clay has many electronic and optical properties as they continue to learn more about it . An electron microscopic study of the clay particles in water revealed that the clay is made up of single layers of MXene about one nanometre - just a few atoms - thick. This atomically thin structure indicates that researchers are likely to find the clay has many electronic and optical properties as they continue to learn more about it. Investigations of the clay’s performance found the clay’s ability to store an electrical charge is three times that reported for MXenes produced by hydrofluoric acid. This means it could find uses in the batteries that power phones and start cars, or even in a supercapacitor that could one day help renewable energy sources fit into a regional power grid. Despite it being a ‘very first generation’ material, the experts said the clay is already showing a higher charge storage, per unit of volume, than most other materials. It also doesn’t lose any of this so-called capacitance even after more than 10,000 charge and discharge cycles. Elsewhere, the clay could also be watered down into a conductive paint that hardens within a few minutes, while still retaining its conductive properties. ‘As anybody who has played with mud can attest, clay is water-loving,’ fellow author Professor Michel Barsoum said. ‘Clay is also layered, and when hydrated, the water molecules slide between the layers and render it plastic that in turn can be readily shaped into complex shapes. ‘The same happens here; when we add water to MXene, water penetrates between the layers and endows the resulting material with plasticity and moldability.’ The salt and acid are much safer to handle than toxic chemicals used previously, and created a pile of black particles. To stop the reaction and remove any residual chemicals, the researchers washed the material in water. The sediment absorbed the water to form a clay-like material that could be rolled (illustrated) One of the first tests the team performed on the clay was to see if it could be pressed into a thin layer (pictured) while retaining its conductive properties. The clay was found to store an electrical charge three times that reported for other MXenes and didn't lose this ability even after 10,000 charge and discharge cycles . ‘What we discovered is a conductive two-dimensional layered material that also loves water. ‘The fact that we can now roll our electrodes rapidly and efficiently, and not have to use binders and conductive additives renders this material quite attractive from a mass production point of view.’ Mr Ghidu admitted he was just hoping for a safer, less expensive way to make MXenes, and didn’t expect anything like this. The clay has been compared to Play-doh (pictured) as well as chocolate chip cookie dough . Now the researchers can simply wash the resulting material and roll the resultant clay into films of various thicknesses. One of the first tests the team performed on the clay was to see if it could be pressed into a thin layer while retaining its conductive properties. The clay was found to store an electrical charge three times that reported for other MXenes and didn't lose this ability even after 10,000 charge and discharge cycles. ‘Being able to roll clay into a film is quite a contrast in production time, safety and cost when compared to the two most common practices for making electrode materials,’ Mr Ghidiu continued. ‘I would say the most important benefit to the new method - besides its increased capacitance - is that we can now make an electrode ready-to-go in about 15 minutes, whereas the total process before from the same starting point would be on the order of a day.’ Plus, being able to make conductive clay using common chemistry class items is the ‘materials equivalent of making a chocolate chip cookie - everybody has these ingredients in the pantry’, explained Professor Barsoum. This work was supported by the Ceramics Program of the National Science Foundation and by the U.S. Department of Energy’s FIRST Energy Frontier Research Centre. The findings are published in the journal Nature.","The clay is a type of material made by Drexel University known as MXenes .

"The City of New York approved a proposal by one of the largest real estate developers in the city to build in a 'poor door', or a separate door for residents living in affordable housing to enter their building. According to a Saturday report from the New York Post, the city approved the application of Extell, one of the most prominent developers in New York, to install this separate set of doors into a high-rise located on 40 Riverside Boulevard, a location situated next to the Hudson River. Extell's proposal allows them to force affordable housing tenants to walk through an entrance located in a back alley behind the building to enter, leaving the more prominent front entrance for tenants paying for nicer apartments. A view of the high-rises lining Riverside Boulevard, in New York. The city approved an application by prominent developer Extell to install a 'poor door', or a separate door for tenants living in affordable housing to enter the building through . Under the Inclusionary Housing Program, for which the city approved Nextell's application, larger properties are allowed to be built as long as they include a portion of affordable housing units. For the 40 Riverside Boulevard location, 55 units will be designated as affordable housing, all units facing the street. Another 219 units will face the river. A spokesman for the NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development confirmed that the agency had approved Extell’s application for the Inclusionary Housing Program. Despite the approval of this application, the New York Post reports that Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer vowed to reject future developments with separate entrances. Extell applied to the Inclusionary Housing program in August 2013, which drew the ire of many critics, including Christine Quinn, who was running for Mayor at the time. Quinn called for a change of laws to force developers to provide common entrances for all occupants. However, some developers dismiss the outcry over the 'poor door' concept. 'No one ever said that the goal was full integration of these populations,' David Von Spreckelsen, senior vice president at Toll Brothers, another developer specializing in luxury residencies, told The Real Deal in 2013. 'So now you have politicians talking about that, saying how horrible those back doors are. I think it’s unfair to expect very high-income homeowners who paid a fortune to live in their building to have to be in the same boat as low-income renters, who are very fortunate to live in a new building in a great neighborhood.' Toll Brothers developed the high-rise at 1 Northshore Pier, a luxury building in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. This building purpotedly includes a 'poor door.'","The City approved a proposal from Extell, a prominent NYC developer, to install a separate door for tenants living in affordable housing units to enter the building .

"Mr Webb said the older generation could face 'boredom, loneliness and poverty' as he encourages more elderly to return to the workforce . Britons who haven't planned for their future will be left with nothing but boredom, loneliness and poverty in old age, Pensions Minister Steve Webb has said. Rather than working for longer, or enjoying the fruits of their labour in their final years, the minister issued a bleak assessment of old age if the elderly did not take steps to secure their futures. His comments come as he launches the 'Fuller Working Lives' programme which aims to extend flexible working to all employees straight away so older workers can combine employment with caring for relatives. As the state pension age can start as early as 61, Mr Webb, 48, is 13 years away from reaching it himself. The warning came in a foreword, written by Mr Webb and employment minister Esther McVey for the government paper. The foreword states: 'For some, retirement is something to look forward to, something they've worked hard to achieve, a time to spend more time doing more of the things they love: taking up new hobbies, volunteering in the community or simply taking it easy. 'For others, without adequate financial planning, it can become a time of boredom, loneliness and poverty.' The impact of an aging population and . falling birth rate means over the next decade there will be 700,000 . fewer people aged 16 to 49 -  but another 3.7milllion people between 50 . and pension age. Millions of over-50s must be encouraged to stay in the job market with offers of flexible hours and careers advice, ministers say. Mr Webb said the older generation of workers are a ‘vast untapped talent’ and must be encouraged to stay in employment for longer, or lured back if they have retired early. He will appoint an older workers’ champion to ‘challenge misconceptions’ about giving jobs to older staff who ministers say could provide a huge boost to the economy. The ‘Fuller Working Lives’ programme announced will extend flexible working to all employees straight away so older workers can combine employment with caring for relatives. The government drive to get older people back into the workforce is focusing on women in their 50s who have taken time out of work to help with caring responsibilities, and men in their 50s who have taken sick leave or incapacity benefit from work, who may no longer be able to do their previous job for health reasons . In addition, job centres will pilot courses aimed at retraining older workers, and employers given advice on how to accommodate staff with certain health problems. A recent survey of 400 McDonald’s restaurants across Britain showed customer satisfaction was on average 20 percent higher when they employed staff aged 60 and over. Academics found older staff at the chain were more likely to empathise with customers, go the extra mile in serving them, and could use their life experience to help mentor younger staff. Around 60 percent of people in the UK aged 55 to 64 are in work and the number is growing. Older workers saw far fewer job losses during the recession in Britain than younger workers did, which experts say is a vote of confidence in their skills and hard work. But Mr Webb said in some other countries the employment rate for this age group is around 70pc or higher, and believes Britain should aim to raise its game. ‘Older workers have a huge amount to bring to any workforce and are a vast untapped talent’, he said. ‘We . are living longer and can expect many more years of healthy life. It’s . great news – but it’s something that as a society and as an economy we . need to respond to. ‘I am . determined that we boost our support for older workers and help . employers challenge outdated perceptions to see the real strengths of . this important section of the workforce.’ Mr . Webb is the minister behind the decision in this year’s budget to allow . people to cash in their pension pot from the age of 55. Currently they can take a small lump sum when they retire but the rest must be invested in an annuity -  a product which gives pensioners a guaranteed annual income for the rest of their life. He said having the flexibility to cash in part of their pension while continuing to earn money would also help people have a ‘gradual retirement’. Two groups of pensioners are at the heart of the government’s drive to get older people back to work. One is women in their 50s who have taken time out of work to help with caring responsibilities, for their elderly parents or grandchildren, and have found it difficult to return. Mr Webb said they could benefit from more flexible hours. The second is men in their 50s who have taken sick leave or incapacity benefit from work, who can no longer do their previous job for health reasons but could be retrained to do something else. Caroline Abrahams of the charity Age UK said the measures were ‘essential’ to stop an older generation, who are living longer, being excluded from work and struggling for money. She said: ‘Too many older people still find themselves locked out of the workplace despite overwhelming evidence showing they are at least as productive as their younger counterparts and make an invaluable  contribution in terms of their experience, knowledge and skill. ‘Nearly half of all unemployed people aged 50 and over have been out of work for more than a year, with many in this age group finding it incredibly hard to get another job.’ It is already illegal to sack a person for turning 65. The state pension age will rise to 66 from 2018 and to 67 from 2026.","Pensions Minister Steve Webb issues bleak assessment of life in old age .

"Many chaps would assert that map-reading is not really a female forte. Now scientists have come up with a way for women to alter that perception. Apparently, they should start playing video games. Research suggests that using a games console for just half an hour a day makes brain regions associated with navigation grow, and regular game-players have a greater ability to build a mental map of their surroundings. Bored? Don't be: A study on women in Germany found playing games improved map-reading (file photo) Previous studies suggested regular game-players had more grey matter in the area of the brain used for this purpose, but it wasn't clear if there was a direct link. The study, at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, used volunteers with no experience of gaming, most of whom were women. Half were told to play Super Mario 64, a game with a strong navigation component, for 30 minutes a day for two months. The rest did not play any games. Scans of the gamers’ brains revealed new grey matter in areas associated with map-reading and memory, and tests of their navigation skills showed they were better at creating mental maps. Writing in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, lead researcher Dr Simone Kühn said: ‘I’m fairly convinced that what we were training here was basic spatial orienting. ‘This study is the first to show changes in the brain’s structure over the course of being trained to play a video game.’ The results echo previous findings in . London taxi drivers, which showed a growth in the brain’s memory hub the . more time they spent on the job. Uncertain: The women were playing Super Mario, but it is uncertain if the rules apply to all console games . In order to qualify, drivers of black cabs must spend years creating a detailed mental map of London’s streets to pass The Knowledge. Dr Kühn added: ‘We showed that the bigger the change in the hippocampus was, the more the volunteers navigated using this more male navigation strategy.' Dr Kühn hopes her work will ultimately yield new ways of helping to combat some of the memory loss and orientation problems experienced by people with dementia. She said: ‘One of the first signs of dementia is that people tend to lose their sense of orientation. ‘Video game playing could maybe prevent some of the decreases in structure and function seen in these degenerative diseases.’ Dr Hugo Spiers, a spatial cognition expert from University College London, described the research as interesting but warned: ‘The big question is whether this actually translates into real-world improvements in map reading or in helping people with memory problems.’ It is also unclear whether all video games are equally beneficial – although some studies suggest that Tetris and other logic puzzle games also boost the brain.","Study carried out at Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin .

"Visitors flock to Iceland to see its impressive geysers, Blue Lagoon and meandering glaciers. And soon there will be a new way of taking in the country’s second largest ice cap near Reykjavik – from an underground tunnel dug deep beneath the dense ice.

Icecave Iceland is due to open in the spring of next year and will enable tourists to take in blue ice at the heart of the Langjökull glacier and understand how it formed. But for now, there's a video enabling people to take a virtual tour so they have an idea of what to expect. A screen shot is pictured . A CGI video has been released to let people take a tour from the comfort of their sofa. It gives potential visitors an idea of what to expect, including tunnels, underground rooms and lit caverns. Engineers are currently carving the 1,640 foot (500 metre) long tunnel beneath the glacier and are installing lights to best show off the layers of ice. Engineers are currently carving the 1,640 foot (500 metre) long tunnel (pictured) beneath the glacier and are installing lights to best show off the layers of ice. A geologist is on hand to advise on the operation . Langjökull glacier (marked with a a red flag) is located north east of Iceland's capital, Reykjavik. It's the is the second largest ice cap in Iceland with an area of 953 square kilometres . The glacier (pictured) is roughly parallel to the direction of the country's active volcanic zone, running north-east to south-west. It is about 31 miles (50 km) long and nine to 12 miles (15-20km) wide . If you stare into deep crevasses in glaciers - or take a tour beneath one - you will notice that the ice is blue. Snow, and ice near the surface, is white because the full spectrum of light is scattered and reflected. The ice looks blue because it is so dense, with no bubbles to scatter visible light. In ice, the absorption of light at the red end of the spectrum is six times greater than at the blue end. So as light travels into the glacier, red light is gradually lost. A lack of reflected red wavelengths mean that we see the ice as blue. Glacial ice is made up of compacted snow that has fallen over thousands of years. Visitors to the attraction will see stripes of subtly different coloured layers of ice that represent different periods of snowfall. The layers can be analysed to tell experts about the weather conditions at the time the snow fell. Whiter layers formed when the weather was particularly cold, because air was trapped within the ice crystals, which is reflective. Layers that are darker or bluer in colour were created by snowfall in warmer or wet conditions when little air was trapped in the snow. The weight of the snow build-up compressed the layers and the air trapped within them, causing ice at the heart of a glacier to appear a brilliant blue. Icecave Iceland says the attraction will offer a ‘once in a lifetime adventure, to explore around, on and within the mighty Langjökull glacier, where they will be able to see, the beautiful blue ice that lies at the heart of the glacier,’ when it opens. Tourists visiting the attraction will see large caves beneath the glacier (pictured) and will also be able to sit inside man-made rooms with ice furniture, according to the video tour . People embarking on the tour will travel up the glacier to the ice cave, on eight-wheel drive super trucks. ‘Exclusive groups, will experience the thrill of descending beneath the ice cap glacier, learning interesting facts about glaciers, and eventually reaching the beautiful and stunning blue ice, that lies at the heart of the glacier,’ it says. Tours will run between March and October depending on the weather. While there are other natural caves in Icelandic glaciers, they are seasonal, forming in warmer months and lasting in winter.

Ms Tu told 7.30 she didn't believe the strengthening rules would have an effect on her cashed-up clients. 'There are a lot of rules, and first of all they have to have a visa, they have to be a resident here and they will be able to buy,' she said. 'The majority have a significant investor visa... I think you have to invest a certain amount of money like, probably, $5 million into a business or management funds, and that is how they qualify for the visa.'","Monika Tu raked in $120 million this year through her Sydney-based real estate firm Black Diamondz .

"An 18-year-old high school student who was seen in an iconic image being aided by a stranger at the Boston Marathon terror attacks had her limbs shredded by shrapnel and her mother lost both her legs. Sydney Corcoran was severely injured by debris in Monday's tragedy and her mother, Celeste Corcoran, needed to have both her legs amputated below the knee. Sydney, whose femoral artery was ruptured, awoke from surgery to ask relatives to locate the men who saved her life. 'Find Matt,' she said, according to her aunt, Carmen Acabbo. 'We would all like to thank him,' Acabbo said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Comfort: A man aids Sydney Corcoran after her legs were shredded by shrapnel. This touching image led some to speculate, incorrectly, that he was proposing to his dying girlfriend . Horror: Another good Samaritan and emergency workers come to Sydney's aid. Syndey cheated death before after surviving a serious car accident in 2011 . Tragedy: Sydney Corcoran is seen here with her mother Celeste, who lost both her legs in Monday's terror attacks. Celeste works as a hair dresser and is 'such an active person' It was another horrifying incident for . the family as Sydney cheated death in 2011 when she survived a car . accident which left her with a fractured skull. 'I thought we were done with traumatic events,' said Sydney's older brother, Tyler. Sydney, a Lowell High School who is set to attend community college this fall, suffered deep arterial injuries, according to Tyler. 'Her legs were hit pretty bad,' the brother said. The picture of the man in a red t-shirt was so touching that it sparked a false rumor on Twitter that he was proposing to his dying girlfriend. A picture telling the tragic, but incorrect, story was retweeted 1,600 times and received 448,000 likes on Facebook. It spread around the internet before being debunked. Rumor: A Twitter posting of the picture received 1,600 likes saying the man proposed to his dying girlfriend, which was untrue . The attack, which left three dead and 183 injured, occurred as two bombs were detonated just seconds apart near the finish line. 'My father said everyone seemed in a . daze. He looked down and saw my mom and her eyes were open. 'Once he . realized she was alive, he noticed both her legs hanging on by skin. He . asked a guy for a belt,' Tyler said. The family was at the race to watch Accabo, Celeste's sister, compete. A third man rushed to Sydney's aid after shrapnel tore into her legs. A relative said the family 'owes' the good Samaritans 'unspeakable gratitude' 'I thought we were done with traumatic events': Tyler, here with his mother Celeste, was supposed to attend the race with his family but cancelled at the last minute . Tyler, a college student, was supposed . to attend the event but cancelled at the last minute because he had to . meet with a study group. 'I . was supposed to be there,"" said Tyler, fighting back tears. 'I didn't . even think this whole thing was real until my phone started ringing like . crazy later in the afternoon.' Kevin, a delivery truck driver, received minor injuries but is having a difficult time coming to terms with the wounds suffered by his wife and daughter. 'My brother is just heartbroken, just devastated,' his brother, Tim Corcoran, told the Lowell Sun. Celeste works as a hairdresser in Boston. Sydney's and Tyler's great uncle Paul Corcoran said Celeste has always been 'such an active person,' and that 'it’s going to seriously impact her career.' 'It’s just been a devastating experience,' he said. 'I don’t know how we’re going to cope with this.' A website to raise funds for the injured mother and daughter has been created, with the goal of raising $300,000 to aid in their recovery. By Wednesday morning, it was already more than halfway to its goal. The website, organized by relative Alyssa Carter, included updates on their conditions. Carter said they were headed into additional surgery Wednesday afternoon to remove further debris and make additional repairs. 'The . nurses were able to get them in the same room and their beds are pushed . together so they can hold hands,' Carter, Tyler and Sidney's second cousin, said. Carter told MailOnline that both are in good spirits despite their circumstances. 'Celeste is a firecracker. She's just upset she didn't see her sister cross the finish line,' Carter said. 'Celeste is the glue of the family.' Sydney has been more reserved since Monday but 'has cracked a few smiles. They're hanging in there. We have a large family,' Carter said. When asked about Sydney already overcoming her 2011 accident, Carter said she feels horribly for her cousin. 'She's just a kid. It's depressing to think of Sydney's struggles.' The Corcoran family has been touched by trauma again. Dad Kevin, right, is 'heartbroken' over the devastating injuries suffered by his wife and daughter . Carter said the fund would help cover expenses in light of Celeste not being able to immediately return to work as a hairdresser as well as do modifications on their home to accommodate their injuries. 'So much will be needed.' Paul Corcoran said that he had been in contact with the family via Facebook and saw the picture of Sydney lying on the street all over the internet on Monday but didn't immediately realize it was her. It wasn't until he looked at the front page of the New York Times on Tuesday that he saw it was Sydney. 'I've seen the picture online with all the articles and with the smaller ones I couldn't quite tell,' he told the Los Angeles Times in a phone interview. 'But you're looking at the front page of the New York Times. I mean, that's her.'","Picture of a wounded Sydney Corcoran being aided by strangers was seen around the world .

"Katie Littlewood looked the wrong way down the railway tracks as a train was approaching at up to 60mph, an inquest has heard . A schoolgirl killed by a train at a rail crossing may not have heard it because she was using headphones and texting friends, an inquest heard yesterday. The train driver said lecturer’s daughter Katherine Littlewood, known as Katie, stepped on to the crossing without looking. The 15-year-old was on her way to a British Heart Foundation charity shop where she was a volunteer when she was hit. A set of headphones, an iPod and a phone were found near the GCSE student’s body. Katie, who was described as ‘lovely and happy’, had sent her sister a message about getting her ears pierced shortly before walking on to the crossing in Bishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire. Train driver Steven Trumm repeatedly asked in the aftermath of the accident: ‘Why didn’t she look?’ He told an off-duty police officer who was travelling on the train that Katie turned around at the last minute when it was too late. She died instantly. Mr Trumm said: ‘She just walked out without looking. She’s a young girl about my daughter’s age. It’s the second time it’s happened to me.’ The train, travelling from London Liverpool Street to Cambridge, had been accelerating after leaving Bishop’s Stortford station and was travelling at 60mph when it hit Katie in January last year. Mr Trumm was the only witness to Katie’s death and was clear she was not trying to take her own life. He told police: ‘I saw the female stride forward purposely as if she had made the decision it was safe to do so. ‘As I sounded my horn, the female looked towards my approaching train. She looked shocked and then the train almost instantaneously hit her.’ Katie had been on her way to her job at the British Heart Foundation just before midday when she died . Katie Littlewood (pictured, right, with her sisters Sarah, left, and Stephanie, centre) may have been listening to her headphones at the time of the incident . Signs at the crossing in Bishop Stortford warned it was safe to cross only when there was a green light . Katie’s father, Simon Littlewood, who . attended the hearing with her 18-year-old sister Sarah, expressed . sympathy for the driver, who was not present. The lecturer said: ‘The family have great sympathy for the driver for what he had to go through.’ Detective Inspector Andrew Rose, of . the British Transport Police, said: ‘We found a set of earphones, an . iPod nano and a BlackBerry phone by her body. 'There were three uses of . her mobile phone before the accident. The messages were normal “chit . chat” – typical text messages of a teenager.’ Signs at the crossing, near Stansted Airport, warned pedestrians that it was safe to cross only when there was a green light. Police lay flowers at the scene where Katie was hit by the train . Katie's father Simon Littlewood, pictured with his daughter Sarah Littlewood, told the inquest he wanted the death 'to act as a warning to everybody' The system had been installed after a woman walking her dog died at the same spot in 2002. There was also what the coroner Edward . Thomas described as ‘an audible warning’. The coroner added: ‘Of . course, if people have earphones they won’t hear it.’ Despite the safety improvements . another woman, Andrea Evans, 24, was killed on the crossing in 2006. A . report into Katie’s death by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch . concluded that it was impossible to say for certain if she had been . using her headphones as they were found next to rather than on her body. All warning systems were working properly at the time of her death. The report detailed five years of . inaction and error by Network Rail before the accident. A feasibility . study into building a bridge at the crossing had been approved but not . carried out. It added: ‘Network Rail did not follow . up a proposal in 2007 to install a footbridge after analysis has shown . that the benefits of so doing would exceed the costs.’ A £2million bridge was built over the . crossing nine months ago. A Network Rail spokesman said the company . would carefully consider the recommendations in the report and take any . necessary action. Katie’s mother Ruth White, a family . doctor, died from cancer in 2009 aged 49. The teenager and her sisters . Sarah and Stephanie, 12, moved from Morpeth in Northumberland to live . with their uncle and his partner in Hertfordshire. The jury at Hertfordshire Coroners . Court in Hatfield returned a verdict of accidental death after more than . an hour of deliberation. A pair of headphones, an iPod Nano and her Blackberry phone were found next to Katie's body at the crossing.

"Tory Newark by-election candidate Robert Jenrick rejects claims that he has covered up his and his wife’s £5 million property portfolio and £500,000-a-year joint earnings to try to win  the Newark seat. Mr Jenrick presents himself as a ‘father, local man, son  of a secretary and small businessman and state primary school-educated’ candidate. But that is not quite the whole story. Opponent: Robert Jenrick (left) and his Marylebone flat (right), one of two £2million London homes he owns . In fact, he and American wife Michal . own not one, but two, £2 million homes in London and a £1 million . country pile built by an 18th Century slave-trader. Their Newark ‘home’ is a  rented house obtained when he was picked as a candidate six months ago. And his Party CV omits to say he went to a £13,000-a-year private secondary school. Together . with his director’s  job at Christie’s auction house, it is just the . type of posh Tory boy image Cameron and co can’t shrug off. Mr Jenrick, who looks even younger than his 32 years, sticks rigidly to his Tory HQ autocue when asked about national issues. During our interview at a cafeteria in Tuxford, near Newark, he is finally stirred when I ask whether, in his keenness to come across as a regular guy, he has misled voters. To win the candidacy, he promised he would move his family lock, stock and barrel to Newark. A 250-mile round-trip  to Westminster if he becomes  MP – quite a commute for a  self-proclaimed family man  with two young daughters. Wealthy: The Westminster home owned by Robert Jenrick . How many nights has the family actually spent in their Newark ‘home?’ ‘Er, it has grown over time.’  He won’t say. His election leaflets are also silent about the couple’s £2 million flat in Marylebone, London. It went up in value by £300,000 last year, more than twice the average price of a home in Newark. Last October, the couple splashed out an extra £2.5 million on a house in fashionable Vincent Square, Westminster, less than a mile from Parliament, which  they plan to move into soon. On top of that they bought Grade I listed Eye Manor in Herefordshire for £1.1 million  in 2009. Mr Jenrick says he is ‘almost sure’ they will sell it and move to Newark if he becomes MP. It is to be hoped this interview is not the first Mrs Jenrick, a top commercial lawyer whose professional name is Michal Berkner, eight years Mr Jenrick’s senior, has heard of that. Despite appearances, he says  he was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth, and cites  his education at 500-year-old independent school Wolverhampton Grammar  as proof. ‘There was no way my parents could afford to send me to private school. My grandma Dorothy paid the fees.’ Then why no mention of any of it in his  Tory CV? What does he know about life on the breadline? ‘That’s not fair. None of it was inherited or handed on a plate to us. My wife and I have both worked jolly hard,’ he insists. ‘I don’t need to have a disabled daughter to know what it’s like. Pile: Mr Jenrick's third home is a Grade I listed country manor in Hertfordshire, pictured . ‘I don’t need to have lost a child in Afghanistan to meet somebody who has and have empathy and support them.’ He could easily have carried  on enjoying ‘earning money and having nice homes’ but sacrificed it all in a bid to  become an MP. Come off it, he can afford to because his wife earns approaching half-a-million a year with US law firm Skadden and can pay all the bills. ‘I’m not going to apologise for that. I’m proud of her,’ Mr Jenrick says.","Jenrick presents himself as a 'father, local man and small businessman'

"The energy firm in a £25million pay row was accused of blackmail by shareholders yesterday. BG Group has warned that Helge Lund may turn down the post of chief executive if investors do not approve his £25million pay offer. But ShareSoc, which represents individual shareholders in the group, said there was no excuse for the huge sum, which includes a £12million ‘golden welcome’. BG Group warned that Helge Lund, pictured left and right, may turn down the  chief executive post if investors do not approve the salary, but shareholders say no excuse for fat payout and are prepared to lose him . Mark Bentley, ShareSoc’s director, said: ‘We cannot succumb to the blackmail implicit in the statement. I would be happy for Mr Lund to be appointed as chief executive, but see no reason why they needed to offer such a vast package to him.’ Shareholders are supposed to decide on the pay offer at an emergency meeting on December 15 but there are calls for the vote to be scrapped. Royal London Asset Management, a major shareholder that had backed Mr Lund, said it would vote against the measure even if it meant losing him. The investment firm’s Ashley Hamilton Claxton said: ‘The responsible thing to do is to call a halt to the vote and enter into meaningful discussions with shareholders in order to reach an acceptable outcome which motivates the chief executive and clearly aligns his interests to shareholders.’ ‘Barring that, we plan to vote against the pay package.’ Shareholders of BG Group, whose natural gas tanker is pictured at an Egyptian site (file), are supposed to decide on the pay offer at an emergency meeting on December 15 but there are calls for it to be scrapped . Four of the company’s 15 biggest shareholders have publicly criticised the pay deal and many other significant investors have said privately they cannot support it. One of the biggest names to oppose the arrangement so far is Glass Lewis, the US-based group that advises pension funds on how to vote on pay issues. It was behind the removal of James Murdoch from the board of Sky two years ago. Other corporate governance giants to have come out against the deal include Institutional Shareholder Services and Pensions & Investment Research Consultants. The UK Corporate Governance code warns companies against ‘ratcheting up remuneration levels’ and tells them to be sensitive when setting executive pay. It says firms should avoid paying more than is necessary. But there is growing evidence that BG Group has ignored the concerns of investors in the latest row. Mr Bentley has met Sir John Hood, the company’s pay chief, to express worries over its salary policies. ‘He has completely ignored these concerns and just gone ahead with this,’ Mr Bentley said. ‘This is very much a case of vested interests’. Sir John, who is on £153,000 a year, is chairman of the remuneration committee at BG Group, the body of five directors who are paid £1million a year and who proposed Mr Lund’s deal. He is also the remuneration chief at the advertising giant WPP – which has experienced significant investor revolts over the past two years over its pay awards for Sir Martin Sorrell. A BG spokesman said: ‘We believe Helge Lund is the right person to lead BG Group. ‘His proposed remuneration is competitive in the international oil and gas industry.’ BG Group was part of British Gas when privatised, but became a separate company in 1997.","BG Group say that Helge Lund may turn down role if salary not approved .

"Thousands of children in a crime-ridden Mexican province are handing in their toy weapons in exchange for less violent alternatives, including footballs and Lego. The campaign is aimed to prevent children growing up to use real guns and curb the violent culture of the area. Pretend guns, swords and rifles - and even real knives - were handed in by children in Nuevo León as part of a government campaign to promote a culture of peace amongst youngsters. Thousands of children took part in a toy gun amnesty in a bid to curb gun violence and promote peace. Pictured, a Mexican girl pictured with a pretend gun . Children were given footballs, baseballs and basketballs to encourage participation in sports as well as yo-yos and building blocks. Patricia Salazar Marroquin, a local official, said the programme would promote peace and remove the incentive for violence in the playground. She told The News: 'These actions remove the incentive for the use of violent games and promote family time in the community.' She added the exchange will generate awareness among children about the negative aspect of the symbolism of violent toys in their daily lives of children and held them find ways to peacefully resolve conflicts. It's not the first time a campaign like this has taken place in Mexico. In Ciudad Juarez in 2011, children were asked to hand in pretend pistols as part of the Children's Festival for Peace.

Nuevo León's capital Monterrey, one of the country's wealthiest cities and formerly one of the safest, has seen a spike in cartel violence. In October last year, a 20-year-old cartel assassin admitted killing 45 people, and was linked to 34 other murders. He was caught in Monterrey where he was allegedly selling drugs. The drug war has escalated over the past few years as cartels battle each other for control of smuggling routes in the US. Around 1,000 people a month die in gangland killings in Mexico and about 80,000 people have died since 2007 in drug-related violence.","Campaign aimed to curb violence in crime-ravaged province of Nuevo León .

"The ocean floor is home to many weird and terrifying predators, many of which could discourage anyone from ever setting foot into the sea again. This creature is Eunice aphroditois - also known as the Bobbit worm, apparently after an underwater photographer decided two decades ago that its hunting methods were similar to the Bobbitt family incident of 1993. That incident involved Lorena Bobbitt slicing nearly half her husband's member off. E. aphroditois is similar, according to a 2011 paper in Revista de Biologia Tropical, 'because either the widely open jaw pieces resemble scissors, or because the exposed portion resembles an erect penis.' Can literally slice its prey in two: The iridescent Eunice aphroditois - nicknamed the 'bobbit worm' - that snares prey between two sharp mandibles which snap shut like scissors . The nickname is inaccurate - Mrs Bobbitt inflicted the grievous injury on her husband using a knife rather than scissors - but it has stuck nevertheless. And it is perhaps a close enough comparison to dissuade any man from skinny dipping in warm waters near the sea floor at depths of 30 to 130ft, where the long-living nocturnal worm is generally found. The creature, which spends its life mostly buried beneath the sand of the sea-floor, sticks just a portion of its body up into the water where it has five antennae to sense its prey, usually smaller worms and fish. Mammoth: A scientists poses with the 10ft-long E. aphroditois discovered in Japan's Seto Fishing Harbour in 2009 . It snares its prey using a complex feeding apparatus called a pharynx which can turn inside-out, like the fingers of a glove, and has sharp mandibles on the end which snap shut like scissors. Unlucky creatures are sometimes sliced in two because of the speed and strength of the worm's attacks, and it can dish out nasty bites to any humans who stray too close. One the prey is caught, the worm shoots back into its burrow to feed. When prey is scarce it also feeds seaweed and other sea plants, and will scavenge for morsels around the surface of its burrow. Noted for its unusually large body size and length, E. aphroditois is found in warm waters all over the world. Since the 19th century, marine biologists have recognised it has having one of the longest bodies among polychaetes - a class of segmented, mostly marine worms. They average a length of about one metre, but specimens measuring as long as three metres have been discovered. A white whale which learnt to imitate the voices of humans may have been trying to make contact, scientists believe. The male named Noc had a distinctly human-like voice, much to the surprise of scientists who previously thought whales typically produce sounds in a manner that is wholly different from humans. Noc died five years ago after 30 years of living amongst dolphins and other white whales and being in contact with humans at the National Marine Mammal Foundation based in San Diego in California. However, the incredible recordings of the whale were revealed for the first time as the team published their findings. Sam Ridgway, who led the study, said: 'Our observations suggest that the whale had to modify its vocal mechanics in order to make the speech-like sounds. Such obvious effort suggests motivation for contact.' A report by Hiro'omi Uchida, assistant director of the Kushimoto Marine Park Centre in Japan, describes one such mammoth worm found hiding in one of the floats of a mooring raft in Japan's Seto Fishing Habour in 2009. '[I]it is uncertain when the individual first entered the mooring raft and fish corral during the 13 years the structure sat in the harbour,' he writes. 'It is also uncertain whether the worm arrived by larval settlement or at a semi-adult stage of development. Nonetheless, the individual surely had been living in its comfortable floating home for a quite a long time.' At 9ft 10in long, about a pound in weight and with 673 segments, the worm they discovered was one of the largest specimens of E. aphroditois ever found. That same year, a report in MailOnline Science detailed how a 4ft-long specimen was unearthed in a Newquay, Cornwall aquarium that was attacking coral and prize fish. Workers at the attraction had been left scratching their heads as to why the coral had been left devastated and - in some cases - cut in half. After staking out the display for several weeks, the last resort was to completely dismantle it, rock by rock. Matt Slater, the aquarium's curator, said: 'Something was guzzling our reef but we had no idea what, we also found an injured Tang Fish so we laid traps but they got ripped apart in the night. 'That worm must have obliterated the traps. The bait was full of hooks which he must have just digested.' Staff believe the beast - which they nicknamed Barry - arrived by hitching a ride into the aquarium hiding inside a piece of coral when it was young and grew enormous over a number of years. Mr Slater added: 'It really does look like something out of a horror movie.'","Eunice aphroditois apparently given the nickname by an underwater photographer two decades ago .

"Missing: Agnese Klavina, the girlfriend of a British businessman, is pictured partying at the Aqwa Mist nightclub in the Spanish resort of Puerto Banus shortly before she went missing in September . Two British men have been arrested over the mystery disappearance of a London businessman's girlfriend last seen three months ago at a Spanish nightclub popular with celebrities. Agnese Klavina, 30, vanished after a night out at glitzy Puerto Banus nightclub Aqwa Mist, a Premiership footballers' favourite and the venue for a packed Chris Brown concert this summer. Her anguished family, friends and boyfriend Michael Millis, a former owner of west London club Westbourne Studios, are planning to travel to Spain soon to make a new appeal for information on her whereabouts. An investigating magistrate probing Miss Klavina's disappearance has placed a secrecy order on the case, preventing public officials including police from making any official comment. But MailOnline has been told that three men, two of whom are understood to be British, have been arrested on suspicion of the waitress's illegal detention - indicating the authorities believe her disappearance was not voluntary - and their homes and cars have been searched. The three men, whose names and ages have not been made public, were released on bail after appearing before the investigating magistrate around a fortnight ago in a closed court hearing while the probe continues. Two of the men are believed to have been arrested after they were identified on CCTV footage leaving the club with Latvian-born Miss Klavina, who had been living on and off in London for the past five years. She was spending the summer in Marbella after flying to the resort in May to start work as a receptionist at luxury Marbella beach club the Ocean Club. She was last seen leaving Aqwa Mist, part-owned by football agent Rob Segal, at around 6am on September 6, with the two men filmed on CCTV. The 5ft 7in blonde, spotted shortly before she left talking to a woman of Russian appearance, was wearing a multi-coloured halter neck dress and carrying a large white Louis Vuitton handbag. Friends reported her missing later the same week along with her mother and sister after they flew to Spain when she failed to respond to calls and messages. They discovered her clothes and bank cards were still at a nearby flat where she was staying. Miss Klavina was last seen on CCTV leaving Aqwa Mist  at around 6am on September 6 with two men . Happy: The Latvian-born waitress was spending the summer in Marbella after flying to the resort in May to start work as a receptionist at luxury Marbella beach club the Ocean Club . Her friends and relatives have put up missing posters around Marbella and the neighbouring resort of Puerto Banus. They have also set up a 'Find Agnese Klavina' Facebook page linked to a GoFundMe page to help raise funds for legal fees linked to the search. London-based Mr Millis, 38, admitted last night: 'We are very, very concerned. I'm 100 per cent sure Agnese would not have disappeared voluntarily. 'She updated her Facebook page constantly with every little detail of what she was doing and we would be in contact most days. 'There's been complete silence since the day she went missing. 'There are days when I fear the worst. And the secrecy order that's been placed on the case means we're not receiving any information on the police investigation. 'It's frustrating, but we understand it's the way things work in Spain and it's something we have to accept. 'We have hired a criminal lawyer to liaise with the police and the courts. 'What we do know is that nobody has been found and that gives us hope Agnese is still alive and can be reunited with her loved ones. 'We urge anyone with any information that can help to contact us or the Spanish police.' Aqwa Mist is one of four Marbella venues owned by international restaurant brand La Sala, whose shareholders include ex-Tottenham footballer David Bentley and defender Dean Austin. Footballer Ashley Cole is said to have spent £12,000 on champagne which he then sprayed over his friends during a night out at Aqwa Mist in July last year. Miss Klavina's fmaily found her clothes and bank cards were still at a nearby flat where she was staying . Her friends and relatives have put up missing posters around Marbella and the nearby resort of Puerto Banus . Hollywood star Eva Longoria, American actor and singer Terence Howard, and boxer Amir Khan have also partied there since its opening in June 2012. The stars of BAFTA award-winning reality TV soap opera TOWIE are also summer regulars at the club, which bills itself as Marbella's number one party venue. Mr Millis said: 'Agnese was really enjoying herself out in Marbella. 'She'd left the Ocean Club but had just started a new job waitressing and seemed really happy. 'I know from visiting Puerto Banus that beneath all the glitz and glamour there's a dark underbelly populated by all sorts of shady characters. 'I very much doubt Agnese would have gone off with two men she had just met in a club voluntarily. 'I'm just praying everything's going to turn out okay and the next phone call I get will be good news.' Agnese's sister Gunta, currently in her home city, Latvia's capital Riga, added: 'We have passed a very distressing 12 weeks since the disappearance of Agi and unfortunately we still have no news.

"It's well known that dolphins have complex social lives and can express their emotions through sound and movement, but since the 1960s scientists have tried  to prove whether or not they have a language. Now, a dolphin expert has used a specially-made underwater translator to understand the whistles of the intelligent underwater mammals. Dr Denise Herzing claims she heard one of the creatures 'say' the word sargassum, a type of seaweed, when she was swimming in the Caribbean last August. Scroll down for video... A dolphin expert has used an underwater translator to understand the whistles of the intelligent animals (stock image) and heard one whistle 'sargassum' - which means seaweed, when she was swimming in the Caribbean last August . The Cetacean Hearing and Telemetry (Chat) is an underwater keyboard that has four symbols which each corresponded to a specific sound and a toy. Currently only a prototype, Chat is fitted to the arm of a diver who activates a sound using the device. The sound goes out through an underwater speaker, letting the dolphin know which toy to pick up. If a dolphin mimics the whistle or a human plays the whistle, the sounds come in and are localised by two hydrophones. The technology can detect the dolphins' natural sounds, letting the human diver who is wearing the device know which call is being made and what it means. It was the first time that a prototype dolphin translator called Cetacean Hearing and Telemetry (Chat) has managed to translate a dolphin whistle. ‘I was like whoa! We have a match. I was stunned,’ the founder of the Wild Dolphin Project, based in Florida, told New Scientist. The machine detected a whistling sound for sargassum which Dr Herzing had invented when she was playing with the dolphin pod that she has studied for the last 25 years. Her team hoped the animals would continue to use the whistles, which are quite different to the noises they naturally make. When the dolphin 'said' sargassum, Dr Herzing heard her own voice because the machine translated the unique whistle as 'sargassum'. It is not known whether the dolphin said the word because it saw some of the seaweed and was trying to communicate with another a dolphin. So far the sargassum whistle has been heard just once. The Chat system was built for Denise Herzing by Thad Starner at the Georgia Institute of Technology, who also engineered Google Glass and uses pattern-discovery algorithms designed to analyse the invented whistles. The team hopes that the system will also reveal what the dolphin’s natural communication means. Dr Herzing and Dr Starner will present their findings on dolphin communication May at the speech and signal processing conference in Florence, Italy. They have managed to pinpoint eight different characteristics in 73 different whistles, matching them with mother-calf interactions and hope to confirm two-way communication between humans and dolphins this summer. The Chat prototype can be seen here fitted to the arm of a diver who activates a sound using the device. The sound goes out through an underwater speaker, letting the dolphin know which toy to pick up and can also be used to decode the dolphins' responses .

"Mark Langridge, pictured, is being forced to pay child support payments after donating his sperm . Mark Langridge didn’t want children, but his lesbian friends did – so he agreed to donate his sperm. Now his ‘act of kindness’ has come back to haunt him 13 years later, after he received a letter demanding child support payments. Mr Langridge has not spoken to the family he helped create since 2004. He was not named on the birth certificates of the two children, and played no role in their upbringing – but the Child Support Agency insists he has to pay £26 a week to support them. He says he cannot afford the payments, which will add up to £8,000 before both children reach adulthood. The 47-year-old book-keeper from Essex has been in a relationship with his partner Shaun Keeble, 37, for 17 years. ‘Me and Shaun were not interested in having children of our own,’ he said. ‘When the idea [of donating sperm] was suggested, we thought it sounded like a lovely thing to do. But the last few months have been a complete nightmare. ‘I feel as if I am the victim of a state-sponsored blackmail plot ... It was purely an act of kindness on my part and now I am being made to pay.’ Mr Langridge and Mr Keeble met the women in a gay nightclub in Southend in 1997, and became good friends. When one of the women revealed she was desperate to have children Mr Langridge agreed to help, as long as there were no strings attached. ‘I did not ask for anything to be documented legally and with hindsight perhaps I should have done,’ he said. After the birth of a baby girl in late 1998, Mr Langridge was asked to donate again – and a second girl was born in 2000. When the children were young, Mr Langridge remained in touch with the mother, and saw the girls at social events. He said he was surprised when introduced as their father and later advised the children to ask their mother to explain the facts of their birth. The two couples eventually drifted apart, and apart from occasional letters from the girls Mr Langridge has had no contact with the family since 2004. The 47-year-old book-keeper from Essex has had no contact with the family since 2004 . In the intervening years the lesbian couple separated, leaving the biological mother with both children. She has since started claiming benefits from the State. Mr Langridge received his letter from the CSA in June. He said the biological mother’s former partner continues to live near the former family home and sees the girls at weekends – but is not being chased for child support. He stressed that he made sure the couple had the funds to bring up children before he donated his sperm. The CSA said that if Mr Langridge had used an official sperm donation centre he would not have to pay child support – but informal arrangements are not covered by the law. Mr Langridge argues that the rules should be changed. The only way he can protest against the CSA’s ruling is by taking his case to a judicial review, which could cost in the region of £60,000. Last night the mother of the children said: ‘It’s all being dealt with at the moment and I don’t want to comment.’","Mark Langridge, 47, has not seen the family he helped create since 2004 .

"Tony Poole, famously cleared of murder after serving 13 years in prison, has been convicted of killing another man . A man famously cleared of murder after serving 13 years in prison has been found guilty of killing another man. Tony Poole, 52, was released in June 2003 when Appeal Court judges quashed his conviction for murdering Hensley Wiltshire in January 1989. But a jury at Bristol Crown Court today acquitted him of murdering his friend Martin Stokes, 30, at a flat in Gloucester in January this year. Many members of the jury wept as they convicted Poole of Mr Stokes' manslaughter and unlawfully wounding another friend, Ben Clark, 47. Poole claimed self-defence, stating he only armed himself with two knives and lashed out kung-fu style - stabbing Mr Stokes in the eye - after fearing he would be attacked himself. During the three-week trial, the cocaine user told jurors: 'In the world I live in you can stab people if they are going to stab you.' As Mr Stokes attempted to evade Poole, he fell from the window of the ground floor flat and plummeted into the basement stairwell below. Poole then stabbed Mr Clark once in the chest before fleeing the property in  Gloucester, taking the weapons with him. Witnesses described seeing a bare-chested man with his fists clenched and arms stretched out 'like a gorilla' leaving the scene shouting: 'If I go down for it, I go down for it'. Members of the public who rushed to Mr Stokes' aid saw he was heavily blood-stained and had suffered a serious eye injury. By the time Mr Stokes arrived at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital he was already unconscious and unresponsive. He died eight days later on January 21. Poole, of Gloucester, denied charges of murdering Mr Stokes and wounding Mr Clark with intent. He refused to attend court to hear the jury's majority verdict of manslaughter and unlawful wounding, delivered after nine hours and 43 minutes of deliberations. 'It was three against one. I picked up two knives from the kitchen side to arm myself against these three,' Poole told the court. CCTV footage showed a bare chested Poole leaving the scene of the crime on January 13 . Pictured is the lounge and kitchen where Martin Stokes was killed during the confrontation with Poole . Martin Stokes (pictured) died in hospital eight days after Poole attacked him . Speaking after the case, Detective Chief Inspector Ruth Mather, who led the investigation, said Poole had shown 'no remorse' for his actions. 'He has shown absolutely no remorse since and has only ever seemed concerned about himself,' Mrs Mather said. 'While in custody for this offence he wanted to control things and, despite telling us that Martin Stokes was his best friend, he showed no remorse for killing him. 'As an individual he is somebody, who even among his friends, there is a danger.' Mr Stokes’ mother, Tania Simmonds, said his children would miss his 'love and affection'. 'The only way I can cope with the dreadful way in which he died is to block the images of his horrific injuries and suffering out of my head,' she said. Mr Stokes’ stepmother, Annie Stokes, paid tribute to him, adding: 'Our lives will never be the same'. 'Martin was good company and fun to be with,' she said. 'He found it difficult to be still, and would be animated, entertaining us with his antics. 'The impact of losing Martin on me and the family has been huge. My mental health and that of his sisters has been adversely affected.' Poole said: 'They mocked me, Ben primarily: ""What are you going to do with that?"" Martin was saying: ""Go on then, stab me"". That's when he said he had been stabbed before. 'He was moving around saying ""Go on, f****** kill me"" and he took a step towards me with the knife and I lashed out and obviously stabbed him with what I call a hammer fist blow. 'As soon as I delivered the blow Mr Clark stepped up towards me so I stabbed him in the shoulder. I remember him saying ""You're proper f***** now"". 'It happened so fast. I said to Ben ""Come at me again and I'll stab you again"". I was very frightened. I looked into Martin's eyes and (what) I could see was fear, he was frightened.' Police footage shows Poole in police custody re-enacting how he stabbed Martin Stokes . During the trial, he claimed he stabbed Mr Stokes with what he called a 'hammer fist' blow . Despite admitting his actions, Poole said he never intended injury or death and claimed the two were his friends . Asked how he felt about the double stabbing, Poole replied: 'Devastated that this had happened. They were my friends. It just got out of hand, I just couldn't believe it that they would really start on me. 'I reacted how I knew I had to. I never intended any injury or death.' The court heard that Poole's compensation money was running out and he was looking to sell his house, having spent it indulging his lifestyle, including 'sex parties' involving cocaine and women. CCTV shows Poole walking through Gloucester city centre bare chested and he later repeatedly demonstrated to police how he lashed out at Mr Stokes. Poole was originally jailed with co-defendant Gary Mills for the murder of Mr Wiltshire during a fight at a flat in  Tredworth, Gloucester. Mr Mills, who died in 2012 aged 53, maintained he had always acted in self-defence after being attacked by Mr Wiltshire while Poole said he never took part in the fight. They always protested their innocence but refused the chance to be released on licence after serving their minimum 10-year tariffs until their case was re-examined by the courts. Family and friends launched the Set up For Life campaign to fight for the men’s release and were successful in June 2003 when the Court of Appeal ruled the convictions were unsafe. Their case had been referred to the Appeal Court by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates possible miscarriages of justice. Lord Justice Auld, Mr Justice Keith and Mr Justice Simon allowed their appeals on two grounds relating to non-disclosure of material and a document wrongly put before the jury which was 'unfairly prejudicial' to the defence of both men. Although there had been 'misconduct' by a senior officer in the case, the judges ruled that there was no evidence of any 'systemic' dishonesty in the investigation 'such as to undermine the integrity of the prosecution as a whole'. After being released, Poole said: 'From what I can see, the judgment doesn’t really go nearly in depth as it should in damning the police. 'There is some criticism there but it falls short. I’m not overly happy - it’s not enough.'","Tony Poole was famously cleared of murder after serving 13 years in jail .

"A decommissioned bus has been transformed into a mobile bathing facility for San Francisco's homeless community giving them a well-deserved place to bathe. Doniece Sandoval, 52, a former marketing executive came up with the concept after she noticed how few places allowed homeless people living on the street to have a wash. She was spurred into action  after she saw a young woman on the street, crying that she would never be clean. Scroll down for video . Bus: Doniece Sandoval, 52, a former marketing executive came up with the concept and found the bus . Help: Ms Sandoval says she wanted to help homeless people with the bus and its facilities . Cleaning station: Thanks to a $75,000 refit, the bus now has two complete bathrooms with a shower, sink, toilet and changing room . The state of the art vehicle will help those in need of a wash during the Thanksgiving holiday as it has two complete bathrooms with a shower, sink, toilet and changing room thanks to a $75,000 refit. There are more than 3,500 homeless residents in San Francisco, yet the city only has eight public showers to accommodate the homeless. Her non-profit, Lava Mae, launched in 2013 and the first bus is now running. It is hoped a full service will launch in spring 2015, with it spreading cross-country. It caters to male, female and disabled passengers. In a video promoting the free service, Ms Sandoval explains to viewers that it offers '20 minutes of compete privacy and respite to hopefully recharge yourself . in a lot of ways.' She continues: 'Lava . Mae's not about ending homelessness. After seeing the rise of gourmet food on wheels, she decided apply the same idea to washing. Novel idea: A decommissioned bus has been transformed into mobile bathing facility for San Francisco's homeless community in a bid to 'restore dignity one shower at a time' All welcome: It caters to male, female and disabled passengers and is free of charge . The bus, however, has been operating since the summer. 'What we are about is providing hygiene, because we believe hygiene brings dignity and dignity opens up opportunity,' she said. Her bus visits the worst affected areas including Mission district as well as the downtown 'Tenderloin' area. The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency has donated one bus for the cause and is willing to provide three more if the Lava Mae project succeeds. Meanwhile the city's Public Utilities Commission has also agreed to let the mobile bathrooms plug into fire hydrants if the water is paid for. Planning process: It took several months to see how the passenger bus could be turned into a bathing facility . The scheme comes at a time of heightened tension in the city, as a tech boom is blamed for taking the soul out of the area  over the past two years. Silicon Valley companies Google, Facebook and Twitter, many of whose workers commute to work from San Francisco, have been accused of ignoring the homeless problem. Today, the city once known for hippies and a laid back culture has some of the most expensive apartments for rent in America and is undergoing gentrification. The average one bedroom place in San Francisco costs $3,100 - $105 more than New York City.","Doniece Sandoval, 52, a former marketing executive came up with the idea .

"Phillip Schofield confessed he had bought alcohol-filled advent calendars, but Christian groups failed to find his choice of gifts  amusing . It was for Phillip Schofield a fun festive gesture. Confessing he had recently purchased three advent calendars filled with miniature bottles of alcohol, he jokily added: 'I have some friends who appreciate the wonders and diversity of alcohol.' Unfortunately for the popular TV presenter, 52, Christian groups yesterday failed to find his choice of gifts quite as amusing. To them the calendars, which feature a tipple behind every window, are silly gimmicks, which distract from the meaning of Christmas. The advent period, which begins on December 1 and is seen as the countdown to Christmas, is marked with candles or calendars which relate to the Christmas story. Sometimes there are chocolates behind each daily window. Now shoppers can pick up advent calendars with a range of treats hidden away, including alcohol. Stocked in high-end department stores and online, the calendars feature 24 miniature bottles of spirits. Harvey Nichols, Selfridges and Fortnum and Mason all sell 'Drinks By The Dram' advent calendars made by the alcohol company Masters of Malt. There is also a whisky one, a gin one – nicknamed 'ginvent' – and also rum or cognac-based calendars, with prices ranging from £132.50 to £175. The company also offers a tequila calendar, which is available online for around £150. A premium whisky calendar costs £279.95 on the brand's website. Schofield, who has two daughters with his wife Stephanie Lowe and is co-host of ITV show This Morning, revealed his choice of gifts in an interview with Waitrose Weekend in which he said: 'Three little advent calendars. In one, behind every window there's a little bottle of tequila – all different kinds. For two other friends, I've got calendars with miniatures of different gins. I have some friends who appreciate the wonders and diversity of alcohol.' Harvey Nichols, Selfridges and Fortnum and Mason all sell 'Drinks By The Dram' advent calendars made by the alcohol company Masters of Malt . Reacting to his comments, David Marshall, whose company The Meaningful Chocolate Company claims to sell the UK's only Fairtrade, charitable and Christmas story-telling advent calendar, said: 'We all like a tipple at Christmas but a bottle of booze everyday seems to be far away from the spirit and the meaning of Christmas. 'Advent is a time of preparation for Christmas and to replace that preparation with mini bottles of booze seems to be taking a step away from what most people would call the true meaning of Christmas.' Stephen Green, a spokesman for the organisation Christian Voice, said: 'Advent is not a time for feasting, it's a time for reflection and waiting. The time for feasting is Christmas Day. 'People need to think, is Christmas really all about drinking and living it up, or is it about reflecting on the fact that God became man in Jesus Christ, who was born as a baby in a manger. 'That's really what it is, that God became one of us in Jesus Christ, we can do without the silliness of alcohol in advent calendars.' The Methodist Church, which only serves non-alcoholic wine at Holy Communion – the ceremony where churchgoers traditionally take a sip of wine – agreed. A spokesman said: 'Christmas is about celebrating the birth of Christ. It's when people come together to worship, praise and remember the birth of Jesus.'","Phillip Schofield confessed he had bought alcohol-filled advent calendars .

Officer Noah Pruitt said: ‘One of the club employees informed me that a white male, black male and a white female, later identified as defendant Mary Lang Gorman, were possibly having sex in the men’s restrooms. 'As we entered the men’s restroom, I noticed the stall was locked. Once the stall door opened, the white male was watching defendant Gorman performing a sex act on the black male.

"Dolphins are known for their intelligence, but it appears this one has even learned how to dance - creating its own hula hoop with the waves of the sea. Amateur photographer Steve O'Toole was watching a pod of bottlenose dolphins off the coast of southern California when he spotted a lone dolphin appearing to dance in the waves. Mr O'Toole, who was volunteering on a whale-watching boat when he spotted the pod, took a series of pictures of the dancing dolphin. When he looked back at the images, taken at eight frames a second, he noticed the dolphin appeared to have formed a hula hoop around its body out of the sea water. Let's do the twist: The Bottlenose dolphin was pictured by Steve O'Toole twisting through the sea off the southern Californian coast, creating its own water hula hoop . Mr O'Toole, from Aliso Viejo, told the Huffington Post: 'As it leapt out of the water, it started to twist its body along its longitudinal axis, like a ballerina. 'I briefly looked at my camera when I was there, and I knew I had something special in it. It just shows that that Mother Nature constantly surprises us with awe and wonder.' The picture of the 'Hula Hoop Dolphin' was later posted on the Facebook page of Dana Wharf Whale Watch - the company Mr O'Toole volunteers for - and was soon being spread over the internet. 'The first thought that came to my mind was [it looked like] a tutu. But through popular demand and social media, it became the ""hula hoop"" dolphin.' PhD candidate at the Hawai'i Institute of Marine Biology, Alexis Rudd, told the website that spinning is a normal behaviour of a dolphin. He said: 'Sometimes spinning and leaping behaviors can be associated with trying to knock off animals like remoras that are catching a free ride on the dolphin, but sometimes not. The most likely scenario is that this photographer just got incredibly lucky with the combination of leaping behavior, wave action and photo timing.'

In media interviews she claimed that when she first started to feel unwell, she relayed the fact that she had been part of the team treating the priest to her doctor, adding that she had had a temperature as high as 38.7C (100 F). But hitting back through her lawyer, the furious medic said in a statement that Romero did not 'in any way' communicate that she has been working with Ebola patients and that the 'clinical record bears witness to this.'

She had also presented a 'mediation demand' prior to suing for defamation, according to The Local. No stranger to legal action herself, earlier this month lawyers acting on behalf of Romero have demanded £120,000 compensation from the government for putting down her dog Excalibur. They claimed the decision to kill her beloved pet 'improvised and taken against medical advice.' However, in a separate case brought by an animal rights group, a Spanish judge ruled yesterday that health authorities did not commit a crime when they euthanised the dog. As well as demanding compensation for her dog through the courts, the nurse is also planning to sue Madrid health chief Javier Rodriguez for defamation. While Teresa was battling to save her life he accused her of hiding information from the doctors who treated her before she was admitted to hospital. He also claimed she could have contracted the Ebola virus by not following protocol. Amid controversy over the training given to health professionals treating the two Spanish missionaries with the disease he claimed on TV: 'You don't need a Masters degree to explain to someone how to put on or take off a suit.' He went on to apologise after Teresa and her husband demanded his resignation.","Teresa Romero, 44, was put in isolation for a month after contracting Ebola .

"There has been nearly one near-miss collision a day on US runways in the past 10 years - a 66 per cent jump,  research has revealed. Last year, 314 incidents - called 'runway incursions' were reported, involving at least one foreign or commercial flight. However, only six of these warranted being deemed at risk of serious crash. Los Angeles International Airport has seen a rise in the number of 'runway incursions' On October 22, two Delta Air Lines planes clipped wings while taxiing to depart from Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport. On October 5, a Delta jet with 44 passengers was clipped by a Royal Jordanian Airlines Airbus A330 carrying 159 passengers at JFK Airport in New York. In May 2013, a United Express flight and a Scandinavian Airlines Airbus A330 collided on a taxiway at Newark Liberty International Airport. In April 2011, an Air France A380 jet taxiing to the runway at JFK Airport hit the tail of a regional jet, spinning the smaller aircraft 90 degrees. The three airports with the most runway incursions since 2003 are also the nation's busiest: Chicago's O'Hare International, Los Angeles International Airport and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International. Experts say the sheer number of reported potential collisions remains a concern, despite there being no fatal crash involving a US domestic airline since 2009. On February 12 that year, Colgan Air Flight 3407, a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400, flying from Newark Liberty International in New Jersey to Buffalo Niagara International Airport in New York crashed into a house in Clarence, New York, killing all 49 aboard the plane and one on the ground. Mark Rosenker, former chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, told USA Today: 'Runway incursions are always at the top of the list when it comes to aviation safety issues.' While many of the 'incursions' pose no real threat to passengers, sometimes it is only a matter of distance that keeps planes out of danger. A traffic jam of airplanes on the tarmac at Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport in January this year left a passenger jet unable to taxi off an active runway. However, other aircraft continued to take off, and the nervous pilot was forced to watch on, helpless. A collision was missed by only some 80-100feet. Chicago's O'Hare International has the highest percentage of near-miss collisions . Writing in a federal report, the pilot described the fact that no collision occurred as 'extremely lucky,' and that if heavier aircraft had been involved, the situation could have been much worse. Last month, two aircraft 'clipped wings' at Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport that saw the flight bound for Los Angeles and Louisville delayed for hours. Passenger Christina Theodoroff, who was travelling to visit family in Los Angeles, told USA Today: 'We were just on the runway, taxiing, and then all of the sudden, there was a big bump that we all felt. 'They wouldn't tell us right away what happened, but everyone around me knew.' As technology has developed over the years with regard to managing airport runways, the chances of serious collisions has fallen dramatically. Estimates in the US are that there was an 84 per cent drop from 2000-2013 in the number of incidents that were regarded as posing a 'severe threat'.","There has been a 66% jump in near-misses reported in the last 10 years .

"The surge in popularity of unmanned, commercial drones has sparked serious air-safety fears in the U.S. after an official report exposed 25 'near misses' with passenger planes in just the past five months. The Federal Aviation Administration says commercial drones are filling the skies at an unprecedented rate and believes there could be as many as 7,500 such machines in American airspace within five years. But with regulation still in its infancy, drones are posing a new threat to aviation safety amid growing reports of 'close calls' with passenger planes over some of the country's busiest airports. In the way: The government is receiving reports nearly every day - and sometimes two or three times a day - of drones flying near airplanes and helicopters or close to airports without permission . Danger: In one case last week, an unmanned drone flew 'under the nose of' a  flight landing at LaGuardia airport in New York (pictured) In one case last week, an unmanned drone flew 'under the nose of' a Jet Blue flight landing at LaGuardia airport while the pilot of a Delta Airlines flight arriving in JFK airport two days earlier told the FAA he saw one hover within ten feet of his wing. On November 13, an Air Canada  Airbus 319, arriving in Phoenix from Toronto, reported a 'disk-like' drone passing within 20 to 40 feet of the aircraft while at 3,000 feet. On October 12, Oklahoma City's air traffic control tower reported an unspecified aircraft 'taking evasive action' to avoid a small drone at 4,800 feet. The pilot said it had a camera attached to the bottom. And on September 30, air traffic controllers reported that a red, black and yellow drone 'almost hit' a Republic Airlines plane as it landed at New York's LaGuardia airport. Surge: While there have been 25 'near misses' in the past year, overall sightings of drones by pilots and air traffic controllers stand at more than 150 and have sharply risen in the past few months . Close call: Two days earlier that the LaGuardia incident, the pilot of another passenger plane told the FAA he saw one hover within ten feet off his wing over JFK airport in New York . On September 17, a pilot of a Cessna 172 reported a drone with two red lights passing 200 feet overhead while at an altitude of 1,800 feet. 'It came out of seemingly nowhere,' he said in an interview, according to the Washington Post. 'If one of those things hits us, we're coming down,' he added. Such close calls have also been reported in major airports in cities including Charlotte, Cleveland, Scottsdale, Arizona, and Norfolk, Virginia, among others . And with online retailers such as Amazon revealing plans to use unmanned drones to deliver packages the  industry is set to boom. Already drones are employed by film studios to film scenes from above and hunters to track their prey. It's a sharp increase from just two years ago when such reports were still unusual. Many of the reports are filed with the FAA by airline pilots. But other pilots, airport officials and local authorities often file reports as well, said the officials, who agreed to discuss the matter only on the condition that they not be named because they weren't authorized to speak publicly. Growing trend: Brian Wilson launches a small drone equipped with a video camera to fly over the scene of an explosion that leveled two apartment buildings in the East Harlem neighborhood of New York . Michael Toscano, president of a drone industry trade group, said FAA officials also have verified the increase to him. While many of the reports are unconfirmed, raising the possibility that pilots may have mistaken a bird or another plane in the distance for a drone, the officials said other reports appear to be credible. The FAA tightly restricts the use of drones, which could cause a crash if one collided with a plane or was sucked into an engine. Small drones usually aren't visible on radar to air traffic controllers, particularly if they're made of plastic or other composites. 'It should not be a matter of luck that keeps an airplane and a drone apart,' said Rory Kay, a training captain at a major airline and a former Air Line Pilots Association safety committee chairman. Bird's-eye view: A remote controlled model aircraft flies over the Washington Nationals spring training baseball workout in Viera, Florida . 'So far we've been lucky because if these things are operating in the sky unregulated, unmonitored and uncontrolled, the possibility of a close proximity event or even a collision has to be of huge concern.' The FAA requires that all drone operators receive permission from the agency, called a certificate of authorization, before they can fly their unmanned aircraft. Most certificates limit drones to 400 feet in altitude and require that they remain within sight of the operator and at least five miles away from an airport. Exceptions are made for some government drones. The military flies drones in great swaths of airspace in remote areas designated for military use. Customs and Border Protection flies high-altitude drones along the U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada. In some cases the FAA has 'identified unsafe and unauthorized (drone) operations and contacted the individual operators to educate them about how they can operate safely under current regulations and laws,' the agency said in a statement late Tuesday. The FAA also said rogue operators have been threatened with fines. Aviation safety expert John Goglia, a former National Transportation Safety Board member, said he's skeptical of some of the reports because most of the small drones currently being sold can't reach the altitudes cited by pilots. Still, 'it needs to be run to ground. That means a real investigation, real work done to determine just what these reports mean,' he said. More than one million small drones have been sold worldwide in the past few years, said Toscano, the official with the drone industry group. It is inevitable that some will misuse them because they don't understand the safety risks or simply don't care, he said. 'This technology has a phenomenal upside that people are still just trying to understand,' he said. 'As unfortunate as it would be that we have an incident, it's not going to shut down the industry.' The FAA is expected to propose regulations before the end of the year that would allow broader commercial use of drones weighing less than 55 pounds. The FAA prohibits nearly all commercial use of drones, although that ban is being challenged. So far, the only commercial permits the agency has granted have been to two oil companies operating in Alaska and seven aerial photography companies associated with movie and television production. But the ban has been ignored by many other drone operators, from real estate agents to urban planners to farmers who use them to monitor crops.","The government is getting near-daily reports of drones flying near planes .

"Teenagers down the years have typically rebelled by drinking, smoking and taking drugs – earning themselves a less than favourable reputation. Today they’re more likely to be found in their bedrooms surfing the web and playing video games on their computers, before sitting down to supper with their parents. Meet the ‘laptop generation’ – the new, more sensible breed of adolescent. Scroll down for video . Teenagers today are more likely to be found in their bedrooms surfing the web and playing video games . A portrait of 13-year-olds today shows they are more ‘sober and responsible’ than youngsters ten years ago. However, they enjoy fewer friendships, spend less time socialising after school, and are more likely to be at home for a family evening meal. The research suggests the rise of social media sites such as Facebook is behind the change, explaining why teens today are more like to say they ‘mainly spend time by themselves’. The Department for Education study, which compared 13-year-olds in 2004 and 2013, found a marked decline in ‘risky behaviour’ among youngsters, such as drinking and taking drugs. Just 32 per cent had tried alcohol compared with 52 per cent in 2004. Meanwhile, the proportion saying they mainly spent their spare time going out with friends fell from 50 per cent to 42 per cent, while the numbers saying they went round to a friend’s house dropped from 20 per cent to 13 per cent. At the same time, 22 per cent reported ‘mainly spending time by themselves’, compared with 9 per cent in 2004. And the proportion who ‘never went out’ doubled, from 5 to 10 per cent. Nearly half of girls – 47 per cent – and 30 per cent of boys reported using social networking or instant messaging sites ‘throughout the day’. 13-year-olds today shows they are more ‘sober and responsible’ than youngsters ten years ago and are being labelled the 'laptop generation' Research by the Department for Education suggests the rise of social media sites such as Facebook is behind the change, explaining why teens today are more like to say they ‘mainly spend time by themselves’ And more than a third of youngsters play computer games most days compared with 23 per cent in 2004. However, the study also found evidence that teens are enjoying closer and stronger relationships with their parents. The traditional family meal appeared to be making a comeback, with 52 per cent of children saying they shared a meal with their parents six times in the last week compared with 42 per cent in 2004. Overall youngsters were generally found to be more ‘positive about their school, home and personal lives’ than a decade earlier. The study concluded: ‘Young people were socialising less in person and spending more time on their own, although spending time with friends remained the most common leisure time activity. It also found a marked decline in 'risky behaviour' among youngsters, such as drinking and taking drugs, and revealed just 32 per cent had tried alcohol compared with 52 per cent in 2004 . ‘There was a parallel increase in the proportion of young people playing computer games. There was also a reasonably widespread use of social networking sites.’ ‘They appear more likely to make responsible choices than ten years ago. ‘The findings in this report are in line with other research suggesting this is a more sober, responsible generation of young people.’ Earlier this year, a Government-backed study showed that the number of schoolchildren who have tried cannabis or other illegal drugs has almost halved over the past ten years. Smoking, meanwhile, had dwindled to a 30-year low, with just 3 per cent of pupils reporting smoking a weekly cigarette. Drinking habits showed similar a pattern. However, experts have warned that a decline in personal contact – driven by increasing use of tablets, smartphones and laptops – is affecting the social skills of a generation.","'Laptop generation' of teenagers more likely to surf web and play games .

"Las Vegas visitors lined up early Thursday at the city's mega-buffets to pile their plates high for an unconventional holiday meal on the Strip. For many, turkey wasn't even at the top of their list. Crab legs were king. That was the case for Josh Wells of Oklahoma City, who brought family and friends to Caesars' Bacchanal Buffet. Unconventional: Josh Wells, 32, of Oklahoma City, seen dining with family and friends on Thanksgiving day yesterday at the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas . 'I don't even think I'm going to touch the turkey,' Wells, 32, said as he waited in line at the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace. With backdrops depicting ancient Greece, Parisian streets and a Rio Carnival, the buffets cost as much as $52.99 and offered a wide variety of favorites, including a traditional Thanksgiving feast of turkey, honey-mustard glazed ham, sage and sausage stuffing, spiked pumpkin soup and apple cobbler. The eateries are much more expensive than the cheap buffets of early Las Vegas, and they aren't as common as the high-end restaurants run by celebrity chefs along the foodie-friendly Strip. But the buffets are still the go-to spot for feasting. Jessica Parks of San Diego and her ten-year-old twin boys stood in line with her brother and his family before 10:30am at Carnival World Buffet at the Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino. They all looked forward to one thing: crab legs. The sweet stuff: Desserts at the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas on Thursday, where visitors lined up before noon for a chance to pile plates high for an unconventional holiday on the Strip . 'I know, we're supposed to say turkey, right?' Parks said. Back at Bacchanal, Wells said he usually treks home to Kansas City on Thanksgiving to visit his parents and friends, but with his parents traveling, he took a trip, too, with his wife, brother and friends. He ticked off the advantages of feasting in Sin City instead of sitting on a couch all day: It wasn't cold outside; he didn't have to smoke a turkey; and he could bet on football games. 'It's been awesome,' he said. It was a busy day for the people who stage the buffet, but Friday would be even busier as people fast-fueled before shopping, said Gabrielle Perez, assistant director of food and beverage for Caesars Palace. She said as many as 4,200 people a day line up at the  Bacchanal's carving stations, belly up to its oyster bar and cruise the dessert counter during the four-day weekend.

Cavazos of Victoria, Texas, listed the items she would have made if she and her family had been home Thursday to celebrate the 70th birthday of her husband John Cavazos. 'Don't forget the ham and the tamales,' he chimed in at Le Village Buffet in the Paris Las Vegas hotel-casino. He was also eager for pumpkin pie rather than cake. Charlie Miller of New Mexico and his two grown children were in search of a no-turkey, non-traditional holiday meal. To make sure they didn't leave hungry, each bought a pass that gave them 24-hour access to five buffets.","Caesar's Palace is expecting around 4,200 diners at its $52.99-a-head Bacchanal Buffet over the Thanksgiving long weekend .

"The devastated Bollywood actress sentenced to 26 years in prison for blasphemy in Pakistan has said she has been left reeling by 'the treatment from my own people'. Pakistani movie star Veena Malik, 28, said she was left shocked and speechless after hearing the verdict and feared she might have a miscarriage when the controversy first erupted. Ms Malik and her businessman husband Asad Bashir Khattak, 30, who have a two-month-old son called Abram, were given lengthy prison terms for taking part in a mock televised wedding celebrating their recent nuptials. Scroll down for video . Shocked and angry: Veena and her husband Asad Bashir Khattak were given long prison terms. The stress from the ordeal made Veena fear she would lose baby Abram, now two-months-old . Fears: Veena said: 'I was four months pregnant when this entire controversy happened. I decided to leave the country because of my baby, not because of myself, as I did want to have a miscarriage' They were accused of acting blasphemously while a religious recital, or munqabat, was performed by musicians as part of the breakfast TV skit. In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, she said: 'As a person who has served humanity for 14 years,  this is not the treatment I was expecting from my own people. It is very shocking. 'I am still in disbelief that Muslim woman, a daughter, a mother, a sister and a wife can be treated like that. Being Muslim, I know what blasphemy is.' 'I was four months pregnant when this entire controversy happened. I decided to leave the country because of my baby, not because of myself, as I did want to have a miscarriage.' But she said she and her husband planned to fight to clear their names and believed justice would be done. And Ms Malik added she was among a number of strong female role models in Pakistan who were winning praise for taking a stance. She said: 'I believe women are empowered in Pakistan. You see a lot of women in media and in politics. Malala [Yousafzai] is an example. 'I have always been a strong personality and get a lot of support from Pakistan. What I see in my country in the future is strong women getting a lot of support and being applauded by my people. 'I do not think they should be taken as a threat. It is an asset and a beautiful thing. I am sure there are people who appreciate strong women in Pakistan and I see a lot of women emerging in different fields.' 'Blasphemy': Veena during the staged wedding with Asad on the morning show. Veena said that she was still in disbelief at the judgement and denied that they were laughing and joking during the devotional son . Controversy: Mrs Malik's husband, Asad Bashir Khan, and the chief of the country's biggest media group, Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman, were also handed 26-year jail terms for their role in the mock wedding in May (above) Real thing: The couple married in Dubai on Christmas Day last year, then followed their nuptials with a second white wedding on a boat in Washington DC in February . Soured: They planned to have a third celebration near Quetta, Pakistan, where Mr Khattak's family live, after the TV show but were forced to abandon their plans and leave the country . The scandal erupted in May when Islamabad-born Ms Malik, who was then four months pregnant, appeared with her husband in a short sketch for Geo TV. On the programme Utho Jago Pakistan [Get Up, Wake Up Pakistan] the pair dressed in wedding garb and sat like newlyweds while wedding songs, or qawwalis, were performed. The controversy surrounds a few seconds when the pair are seen laughing and joking together, apparently when a munqabat, or religious verse, about the Prophet Muhammad's daughter is being performed. Ms Malik's accusers filed 150 first information reports [FIRs] - court documents complaining about criminal offences - against her at police stations around the country. But the actress, who made her name in Bollywood, insisted she did nothing wrong. 'While on the show, I was sitting in a very respectful manner,' she said at her home in Dubai. 'Some publications were writing that we danced to the qawwali but that is not true. If you see the footage, while they played the munqabat my husband and I were sitting in a very respectful manner and did not say a single word which was disrespectful or blasphemous. 'No such thing happened. It was a live show and the control of what is shown on any particular song is in the hands of the cameraman. 'The very next day, the controversy came up and my husband and I were completely shocked because we represented ourselves in a very respectful manner. 'I thought it was just something that would die down. By the time I left, FIRs were registering in each and every corner of the world.' The couple married in Dubai on Christmas Day last year, then followed their nuptials with a second white wedding on a boat in Washington DC in February this year. Controversy: Veena is no stranger to controversy. She caused a firestorm three years ago with a series of raunchy poses for the cover of FHM India . Empowered: Veena said women should not be taken as a 'threat', adding: 'It is an asset and a beautiful thing. I am sure there are people who appreciate strong women in Pakistan' Freedom: Veena told MailOnline that before this ordeal she 'thought it was my basic right to live my life the way I want to live' but now she is 'shocked and saddened' They planned to have a third celebration near Quetta, Pakistan, where Mr Khattak's family live, after the TV show but were forced to abandon their plans and leave the country. They returned to their apartment in Dubai Marina and Ms Malik later flew to the US to have a caesarean birth. The couple were convicted on Tuesday by an anti-terrorism court in Gilgit. Judges said in a court order they had 'ignited the sentiments of all the Muslims of the country and hurt the feelings, which cannot be taken lightly.' The pair had hoped to return to Pakistan, where their parents still live, but fear being jailed if they do not clear their names first. Their lawyers are mounting an appeal in Gilgit and have managed to quash FIRs in a number of states. Ms Malik said: 'I thought it was my basic right to live my life the way I want to live but after this whole thing has come up, I am shocked and saddened.' Ms Malik thinks she is being used as a pawn in a media war being waged in Pakistan. Geo TV has frequently come in the firing line and a month after her appearance, Geo News was ordered off air and fined £60,000 for criticising the head of Pakistan's spy service, the ISI. Ms Malik said: 'I will fight. There are higher courts and I strongly believe everything will be rolled back because there is no substance in this. I still feel Pakistan is my country.' Fight: Veena said that she believes Pakistan courts will roll back the sentence because there is 'no substance'to the case. She added she believed the whole episode has been politically motivated . Disbelief: Veena concluded that 'as a Muslim woman, a daughter, a mother, a sister and a wife can be treated like that. Being Muslim, I know what blasphemy is' She added she had no regrets about the decisions she had made in her career, including causing a storm by appearing on a raunchy cover of FHM India three years ago. 'At the particular given time, I made the best decisions in my life and I don't regret a thing,' she said. 'Whatever I have done, I have done with dignity. I know I have been brutally criticised but I have faced everything gracefully.'","Veena Malik, 28, distraught after being sentenced over wedding on Pakistan TV breakfast show where a religious recital was performed .

"Angry online shoppers branded Black Friday a ‘con’ last night, claiming retailers had increased their prices while advertising big sales. Others claimed stores had pushed up prices before the event to make special offers appear better value for money. Internet fashion retailer Asos admitted it had cut back some of its discounts prior to Black Friday to ‘make way’ for its ‘20 per cent off everything’ deal yesterday. Scroll down for video . Online shoppers claim Black Friday is a con after retailers increased their prices while advertising big sales . The website – which offers high street brands and its own designs, worn by everyone from Samantha Cameron and Michelle Obama to singer Rihanna – left shoppers bemused when they returned to their online ‘basket’ to find some goods had increased in price overnight. Consumer group Which? warned retailers last night to ‘play fair’ and ‘make special offers special’. Common complaints were that sites had dropped the price of some goods but increased the cost of others to capitalise on the rush of buyers. One Twitter user accused an Amazon seller of putting the price up on its iPadAir tablet computer yesterday. He wrote: ‘Please investigate #BlackFriday deals – retailers selling old stock at discount – #Amazon even increased prices on iPadAir.’ Nick Robertson's company Asos has been accused of pushing up its prices ahead of Black Friday discounts . Shoppers were left bemused after they found items in their shopping basket had gone up in price overnight . The businessman claimed to have selected the device, which was sold through a third party, for his online basket two weeks ago at £342. But when he returned to the webpage to buy the item yesterday, it had risen to £372. He told the Mail: ‘Retailers want to get on to the bandwagon of the American Black Friday sale but I feel saddened that not all deals are what they seem.’ Amazon has also been accused of being a 'con' after a third-party seller reduced the price of an iPad . Amazon said the iPad deal was offered by third-party sellers in Amazon Marketplace and was not included in Amazon.co.uk’s Black Friday deals. Several others accused Asos of increasing prices. Writing online, shopper Katie Lea accused the brand of putting ‘loads’ of their sale items ‘back to the original prices for Black Friday’. Another customer asked Asos why a pair of denim hot pants cost £25 yesterday despite being only £20 the day before. She said: ‘Any reason why you’ve put prices up on #BlackFriday? No savings?’ Asos said: ‘We haven’t increased any prices – promise!’ But the retailer added that ‘some promos that we had been running before have now ended’. Kirby Throop, from Leicestershire, tweeted: ‘It’s not really a Black Friday offer when you put your discounted items back up to full price and THEN offer 20 per cent off, Asos, sorry.’ One shopper summed up the frustration, writing on Twitter: ‘#BlackFriday in the #UK is a con, folks! All they do is change the promotional displays.’ An Asos spokesman said some prices had risen as ‘there is one promotion of 20 per cent across everything globally’.","Customers attempting to purchase from Asos website were left bemused .

"Sentenced: Ryan Sheppard, 18, has been jailed for life after he beat an engineer to death in a cocaine-fulled unprovoked attack, which his friend filmed on her iPhone . A girl of 15 used her iPhone to film her friend beating a man to death in a drunken attack. Ryan Sheppard, 17, punched Mark Roberts to the ground in a horrific display of unprovoked violence while high on drink and cocaine. As Mr Roberts – who was due to be married this year – lay helpless, Sheppard hit and kicked him and repeatedly lifted his victim’s head and smashed it down. The girl who was filming was also drunk, as was another girl, also 15, who was with them. Yesterday, as Sheppard was jailed after admitting murder, a judge made a scathing attack on parents who allow teenagers to drink underage. Judge Neil Ford, QC, said Sheppard and the girls had earlier drunk ‘a large quantity of quite strong alcohol’ at one of the girls’ houses. Despite the girl’s mother being present, the group had been allowed to get drunk on Malibu, Peach Schnapps and Cactus Jack. Sentencing Sheppard to a minimum of 12 years and three months, Judge Ford said: ‘This is yet another case where those with parental responsibility fail to appreciate or care about the dis-inhibiting effects of alcohol, effects which in this case have been truly devastating. ‘I appreciate that it is not easy for parents to control the behaviour of teenagers. But this case yet again demonstrates the tragic consequences which can result from heavy consumption of alcohol by young people.’ He told Sheppard, now 18: ‘I have no doubt that your use of alcohol and or drugs contributed deeply to your behaviour on that night.’ Bristol Crown Court heard that Mr Roberts, a 35-year-old engineer, was attacked last October as he walked home alone through a park after a night out in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset. Victim: Mark Roberts, 35, was punched, kicked, stamped on, and had his head slammed into the pavement before being left in a pool of blood. He died 36 hours later . Sheppard approached Mr Roberts and asked him for a cigarette and to take him to a pub. He refused, telling the group to ‘go home’. The teenager then savagely attacked Mr Roberts, repeatedly punching him – while one of the girls used her iPhone to record 90 seconds of footage. Mr Roberts suffered a cardiac arrest and was left unconscious in a pool of blood, but the gang simply walked away. It was left to local residents to call for an ambulance, and Mr Roberts was taken to Weston General Hospital. At the same time that doctors were trying to save him, the court heard that Sheppard was showing the video of his fatal attack to friends. Adam Vaitilingam, QC, prosecuting, said: ‘There was an element of triumph of what he had done. This was a souvenir that could be shown to others about what Ryan Sheppard had done to Mr Roberts.’ Mr Roberts was declared dead 36 hours after the attack. Grief: In a statement read to Bristol Crown Court, Mr Roberts's fiancee described him as her 'whole life' Yesterday members of his family wept in the public gallery as Sheppard was jailed for what the judge called the ‘cowardly, unprovoked, sustained and brutal’ assault. In a victim impact statement, Mr Roberts’ parents Lesley and Andrew said: ‘We have been left broken-hearted knowing the last Mark saw on this Earth was his attacker, the face and voice of evil. One of us should have been that person.’ The statement, which was read to the court by Mr Roberts’ aunt Theresa Sheldon, continued: ‘Until the day we die, Mark will be 35. We will never see him age or get married. Mark died when he was at his happiest. His life and future have been taken away from him.’ At the end of the statement, Mrs Sheldon turned to Sheppard in the dock and told him: ‘You showed Mark no mercy, you should be shown none.’ In her own victim impact statement Mr Roberts’ fiancee, mother-of-two Zara Powell, said his murder had left her suicidal. She added: ‘He will always be my one and only. As well as my children, Mark was my whole life. In the short time we had together we achieved a lot. He made me so happy.’ Sheppard was on licence at the time of the offence, having robbed three boys of their mobile phones in March 2013. He has previous convictions for possessing an offensive weapon and handling stolen goods. The girl who was filming was acquitted of murder and manslaughter following a trial at Bristol Crown Court in June.","Ryan Sheppard, 18, admitted the murder of Mark Roberts, 35 .

"A Florida man has been jailed for five years for letting his two children live in the same house as decaying human remains for weeks. Todd Christopher LaDuke has been found guilty of two counts of child neglect, a misdemeanor count of failing to report a dead body to a medical examiner and possession of a controlled substance. Upon release the 39-year-old will be on probation for a further five years. Todd Christopher LaDuke, left, has been jailed for five years for letting his two children live in the same house as decaying human remains for weeks and his girlfriend, Nicole Scalise, right, was  earlier jailed for three years; LaDuke's children were taken into the custody of The Department of Children and Families . According to Wfmynews2.com on Halloween last year LaDuke and his girlfriend Nicole Scalise were arrested after a well-being check for Tiffany Kain, 33, revealed her remains had been decaying inside their Holly Hill, Volusia County, home for up to three weeks. Kain suffered from spina bifida and multiple sclerosis. Prosecutors said the couple had been living across the hall from Kain's body along with two children, aged six and 11, in 'deplorable conditions'. Court documents revealed the house 'was in total disarray, piles of animal feces and hoards of garbage were everywhere'. According to reports the couple had clear knowledge of the obvious odour and were living without water and illegally obtaining electricity by bypassing their meter. Scalise was convicted of similar charges earlier this year and was sentenced to three years in prison followed by probation. Scalise and LaDuke had admitted to being drug users, reportedly using narcotic painkillers without prescriptions. They also allegedly confessed to using Kain's Social Security card to buy things. The Department of Children and Families took custody of the children.","Todd Christopher LaDuke has been jailed for five years over the crime .

"These are some of the world's largest trees, rising majestically out of the snowy slopes along the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Photographer Michael Nichols spent two weeks capturing images of the 'President' - the world's second-biggest tree which is at least 3,200 years old in Sequoia National Park, deep in the southern region. Sequoias only grow on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, a mountain range which runs 400 miles through Nevada and California. Giant sequoias can reach 247-feet - the height of a 20-storey building. Scroll down for video . Taking on the president: The world's second largest tree, a sequoia dubbed the president, on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada mountain range . Tree of life: Sequoias are particular to the region and can grow as tall as 20-story buildings . Taming a titan: Photographer Michael Nichols spent two weeks capturing breathtaking images of the majestic tree . Writer David Quammen's article accompanies the photographer's series. The following is an excerpt from the December issue of National Geographic magazine: 'It’s not quite the largest tree on Earth. It’s the second largest. Stunning: The December issue of National Geographic Magazine . 'Recent research by scientist Steve Sillett of Humboldt State University and his colleagues has confirmed that the President ranks number two among all big trees that have ever been measured—and Sillett’s team has measured quite a few. It doesn’t stand so tall as the tallest of coast redwoods or of Eucalyptus regnans in Australia, but height isn’t everything; it’s far more massive than any coast redwood or eucalypt. 'Its . dead spire, blasted by lightning, rises to 247 feet. Its four great . limbs, each as big as a sizable tree, elbow outward from the trunk . around halfway up, billowing into a thick crown like a mushroom cloud . flattening against the sky. 'Although . its trunk isn’t quite so bulky as that of the largest giant, the . General Sherman, its crown is fuller than the Sherman’s. The President . holds nearly two billion leaves. 'Trees . grow tall and wide-crowned as a measure of competition with other . trees, racing upward, reaching outward for sunlight and water. And a . tree doesn’t stop getting larger—as a terrestrial mammal does, or a . bird, their size constrained by gravity—once it’s sexually mature. A . tree too is constrained by gravity, but not in the same way as a condor . or a giraffe. 'It . doesn’t need to locomote, and it fortifies its structure by continually . adding more wood. Given the constant imperative of seeking resources . from the sky and the soil, and with sufficient time, a tree can become . huge and then keep growing. Giant sequoias are gigantic because they are . very, very old.' See below for additional images . Iconic: The President is one of the major tourist draws at the Giant Sequoia National Monument which covers much of the Sierra Nevada . Immense: The tallest sequoias are so large that it is impossible to look at them in one go . Intrepid: A researcher climbs a sequoia as part of an effort to measure and map the giant trees . Survivors: Many of the most impressive trees were destroyed soon after they were discovered by settlers in the 19th century . Gorgeous: The majestic plants are considered one of the greatest natural wonders in the U.S. The 'rusty red' tree has a footprint . as large as a room in an average home, and is so huge that it is almost . impossible to look at. Their giant size allows them to . survive disasters which would wipe out many of their woodland . competitors - they are unaffected by storms, resistant to forest fire . and can live even after being struck by lightning. And the trees never stop growing even . when they are hundreds of feet tall - in fact, their rate of growth has . been found to increase the older they are. The trunk is constantly widening, while the upper limbs grow stronger even as the trees age. Steve Sillett and his helpers proved . this unexpected finding by climbing up the biggest trees and measuring . them more thoroughly than had ever been done before. Discovery: The trees were a source of huge fascination when they were found by settlers . Destruction: The early settlers were not afraid to cut down the giant trees for timber . Innovation: A settler in 1890 shows off the path he has cut through the giant sequoia Wawona . The . giant sequoia - Sequoiadendron giganteum - tends to live for many . centuries, enabling it to grow larger than any other species of plant. The . trees are naturally found only in a small area of the Sierra Nevada in . California, nearly all of which is covered by the Giant Sequoia National . Monument. While they . have been successfully grown in other areas of North America and around . the world, nowhere have they been standing long enough to challenge the . size records set by the Sierra Nevada giants. They can live for up to 3,500 years, reaching heights comparable to skyscrapers. The . tallest trees currently standing include the President, the General . Sherman and the General Grant, all above 240ft - but they are far from . the tallest known in history. Soon . after the sequoia was discovered by American settlers in the early 19th . century, many of the most impressive specimens were cut down and . exhibited to gawking crowds. One . of the biggest of them all was known as the Mother of the Forest, which . stood in the area from 668 BC and was discovered by George Gale in . 1852. He stripped the bark of the tree, leading to its swift demise, while a forest fire in 1908 destroyed what was left.

"After his tirade against a taxi driver, getting home from a night out must be a headache for David Mellor. So as midnight approached and looking worse for wear after dinner with friends in central London, the Tory grandee turned to his partner Lady Cobham for a lift instead. But the man once nicknamed the Minister of Fun did not look like he was enjoying his ride one bit as, ruddy-faced and with his tie askew, he sat slumped in the front seat of the snug red Peugeot 206. Lady Cobham and David Mellor pictured after she picked him up following his dinner with friends . Mr Mellor, pictured as he is being driven home, did not appear to be enjoying his ride . Mr Mellor was this week accused of calling a taxi driver a 'sweaty, stupid little git' when he became angry about the route taken by the driver . One can only hope he approved of the route Lady Cobham, who is the chairman of VisitEngland, took back to their £8million riverside home on Thursday night. Mr Mellor, 65, was this week accused of a disgraceful outburst against a taxi driver after he was caught on tape calling him a ‘sweaty, stupid little git’ when he became furious at the route taken by the driver. The former minister listed his achievements, yelling ‘I’ve been in the Cabinet, I’m an award-winning broadcaster, I’m a Queen’s Counsel’, before demanding: ‘Who are you to question me?’ Cabbies vowed to refuse to pick up Mr Mellor as a result. These photographs of him were taken 48 hours after news of his outburst broke. Yesterday an onlooker said: ‘He’d been having dinner for at least two hours in St James’s, then he came out and was on his mobile for a while. We wondered if he was calling for a cab, but I don’t think a cab would pick him up now. Then his missus arrived.’ An onlooker claimed Mr Mellor (pictured) was seen having dinner in St James's for at least two hours before Lady Cobham arrived to pick him up . Mr Mellor’s outburst was secretly recorded last Friday after a visit to Buckingham Palace, where Lady Cobham was presented with a CBE for services to tourism. Mr Mellor also accused the taxi driver of ruining his ‘wife’s’ day – referring to Lady Cobham. As these pictures show, she did not look particularly delighted to be behind the wheel as she drove him home either.","Photographs taken after outburst show Mr Mellor driven home by partner .

"The train carriage which carried Sir Winston Churchill on his final journey after his funeral almost half a century ago has been restored to its former glory ahead of the 50th anniversary his death. Millions of people around the world watched the former prime minister's state funeral on January 30, 1965, in which his coffin was placed into the South Railway parcel van S2464S. Following his death, the train carriage – which once carried basic goods such as vegetables and newspapers - ended up in Los Angeles before being brought back to the UK in 2007. Scroll down for video . The train carriage which carried Sir Winston Churchill on his final journey nearly 50 years ago has been restored to its former glory (pictured) to help mark the 50th anniversary of the former Prime Minister's death . Millions of people around the world watched the state funeral of Sir Winston Churchill on January 30, 1965 . It is now owned by the Swanage Railway Trust and has been restored at the National Railway Museum's site in Shildon, County Durham. From there it will be taken to the museum's site in York where it will be displayed with the Shildon locomotive No 34051, called Winston Churchill, which pulled the funeral train and which has also been restored. Both have been carefully refurbished to their former glory to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the wartime Prime Minister's funeral. At the time, thousands of mourners and well-wishers lined the rail route as Sir Winston's body was taken by the train to its final resting place in Oxfordshire following a state funeral at St Paul's Cathedral in London. The Shildon locomotive No 34051, called Winston Churchill, which pulled the funeral train has also been restored. It will go on display with the famous train carriage at the National Railway Museum in York next year . Restoration work on the Shildon locomotive  (pictured) has been ongoing to return it to its original state . Both the carriage and the funeral train will go on display next year, from January 30 to May 3, as part of the Churchill Final Journey display at the National Railway Museum. Richard Pearson, workshop and rail operations manager at the Shildon site, said: 'We've reached an important point in the project to get the vehicle back to its best, ready to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Sir Winston Churchill's state funeral. 'All that remains is the painting back to its original shade of umber and cream by our dedicated team of staff, volunteers and trainees. 'We anticipate it will be back to its former glory by mid-January.' Restorer Geoff Cale pictured adding the final touches to the newly renovated carriage . The project marks the half-centenary of the train being used at Churchill's funeral . Mr Cale next to a pile of machinery parts used in the restoration process at the National Railway Museum . Anthony Coulls, senior curator of rail vehicles at the National Railway Museum, said: 'Until the 1960s, the carriage was a fairly normal goods van. It carried things like vegetables and newspapers, goods that needed to go from place to place as soon as possible. 'The carriage shows how the everyday can become something quote important, and it is assured of its place on the national stage because of the part it played in Churchill's last journey. 'It is not a glamorous steam engine but it is something that is of great importance to the nation. 'A lot of people still feel strongly about Churchill so it is good to commemorate that.' Sir Winston's funeral was watched by 300 million people on television and attended by representatives from 112 nations. The former PM's funeral (left) was watched by 300 million people on television and attended by thousands . Sir Winston's body was carried in the cream and brown carriage to his final resting place in Oxfordshire . The Shildon locomotive No 34051, called the Winston Churchill, passing through Staines almost 50 years ago . The day saw thousands line the streets of London, where they paid their respects to one of Britain's most historical figures. His body lay in state at Westminster and his coffin was borne down the River Thames with the dockers dipping their cranes in salute. The procession travelled through London to St Paul's Cathedral for the funeral service, before he was laid to rest in the Oxfordshire Parish Churchyard of Bladon, situated close to Blenheim Palace, where he was born 90 years earlier. The carriage, which was built in 1931, was initially used as part of two evacuation trains during World War II, before later being transformed into the original umber and cream Pullman colours in the 1960s. In 1966, it was moved to Los Angeles to be preserved, but it was returned to the UK in 2007 and became a part of the Swanage Railway Trust collection. Now on loan to the National Railway Museum from the trust, the carriage will be exhibited in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Churchill's State Funeral from January 30 next year. Restorer Trevor Addisor, 70, helped to carry out much of the restoration work in Shildon, County Durham . The carriage, which was built in 1931, was initially used as part of two evacuation trains during World War II . It was later used as a cargo train, carrying vegetable and newspapers, before being used for the state funeral . Winston Churchill was born in 1874 at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, to aristocratic parents Lord and Lady Randolph Churchill. He was said to be a poor pupil at school and did not have a close relationship with his mother or father - who died aged 45 when Churchill was 20. He married Clementine Hozier in 1908 and had five children, Diana, Randolph, Sara, Marigold and Mary. Churchill first joined the army in 1893 and had an illustrious military career which saw him sent to Cuba, India and Sudan. Alongside his military life, he also worked as a war reporter and was taken prisoner in South Africa while reporting on the Second Boer War in 1899. Winston Churchill first became Prime Minister in May 1940, following the resignation of Neville Chamberlain . Also pursuing political ambitions, Churchill won the seat for Oldham in 1900, later serving as Chancellor of the Exchequer and Lord of the Admiralty twice. He first became Prime Minister in May 1940, following the resignation of Neville Chamberlain during World War II. During the conflict, he was seen as a pillar of strength and gave several memorable speeches that inspired the British public including a famous 1940 address to Parliament in which he bellowed 'we shall fight on the beaches...we shall fight in the hills....we shall never surrender'. After losing the 1945 election, Churchill served as Leader of the Opposition for 6 years before becoming Prime Minster again in 1951. He suffered a series of strokes during the 1950s and resigned as Prime Minister in 1955 due to his failing health. He finally left Parliament, standing down at the 1964 General Election, and died on January 24 1965 at the age of 90 - exactly 70 years after his father.","Carriage took Sir Winston Churchill's body from funeral to Oxfordshire .

"Next is hiring thousands of cheap Eastern European workers to staff its warehouse, it has been claimed (file picture) A major British retailer is hiring thousands of cheap Eastern European workers to staff its warehouse in an area where more than 200,000 are on the dole, it has been claimed. A former member of staff at Next has revealed how 'busloads' of Polish workers started arriving at the company's warehouse in South Elmsall in West Yorkshire earlier this month. It comes as it was revealed more than 218,000 are out of work in the Humber and Yorkshire area with unemployment higher than average. An agency based in Warsaw has claimed Next, run by Conservative peer Lord Wolfson, has already taken on 7,000 staff from Poland. Former worker Paul Crowcroft, 63, a retired cleaner, is reported as saying: 'They would suddenly turn up in busloads, seven coaches at a time. 'They were bringing them in every day by minibus from places like Wakefield and Doncaster. They were happy on the money because they got so little working back home in Poland. 'They were on the minimum wage.' The Eastern European work force was reported to be arriving to fill 'minimum wage' jobs weeks before the posts were advertised in the UK. Next has said it is currently using about 250 Polish staff but that it takes on about 500 a year and that it advertises in Poland first because it is more time consuming to take on workers from abroad. It advertised the jobs in Britain on November 19 and says 100 jobs are still up for grabs at South Elmsall. A spokesman told Mailonline today: 'We simply can't recruit enough people locally.' Polish jobs agency Flamejobs was said to be fielding a hundred calls a day looking for employment at Next. The firm's operations director Arseniusz Wolinski told the Mirror that 350 people were going to work at Next but that it had already sent 7,000. Polish workers started arriving at the company's warehouse in South Elmsall in West Yorkshire earlier this month, it has been claimed. The plant is pictured from above . He said wages on offer were up to four times the amount Polish workers would earn for the same role in their homeland. Buses started arriving at the warehouse earlier this month with Flame arranging trips from Warsaw at £100 a head, the Mirror reports. Its workers are offered places to stay for a weekly rent of up to £65 a week, the newspaper says. It comes just weeks after it was revealed that food manufacturer Greencore Group was reportedly looking to recruit staff from Hungary for a new £35 million factory due to open in Northampton - as few people living in the area have applied for jobs. A Next spokesman today told Mailonline that it needed to boost its recruitment on a temporary basis twice a year - for the Christmas period and for late spring sales. An agency based in Warsaw has claimed Next, run by Conservative peer Lord Wolfson (pictured), has already taken on 7,000 staff from Poland . He said: 'The local area cannot support that level of demand for these short spikes.' He added that Polish and British workers get paid the same, which was minimum wage and which is topped up with a bonus scheme and that recruitment started earlier in Poland as the process for hiring foreign workers took longer. When asked what measures were taken to secure British workers, he said all available jobs were posted on the firm's own website. 'The bottom line is there are still 100 jobs available which have to be filled. 'Next does recruit from Poland and has for years - it cannot fill its vacancies otherwise,' the spokesman said. He added that Flamejobs' estimation of 7,000 staff having been sent over may well have been over the period of a number of years. Nobody was available for comment when Mailonline contacted Flamejobs this morning. David Cameron has signalled he is ready to lead Britain out of the European Union if other EU states set their faces against tough new proposals to cut immigration. In a much-anticipated speech setting out plans to bar EU migrants from claiming welfare for the first four years after arriving in the UK and deport those who do not find jobs within six months, Mr Cameron warned that he will 'rule nothing out' if other European states turn a deaf ear to British concerns. The Prime Minister insisted that he still hopes to be able to recommend an In vote in the referendum on EU membership he has promised for 2017, and said he was 'confident' of success in the renegotiation of the terms of that membership he plans if Conservatives win next year's general election. David Cameron (pictured) has signalled he is ready to lead Britain out of the European Union if other EU states set their faces against tough new proposals to cut immigration . But he left no doubt that he has not ruled out recommending British exit if other EU nations refuse to compromise on the principle of free movement and accept reforms that he said were 'radical' but 'reasonable and fair'. Welfare changes to cut migration from within the EU 'significantly' will be an 'absolute requirement' in the renegotiation, he said. Under his plans, EU jobseekers without an offer of employment will not be allowed to claim the new Universal Credit when they arrive in the UK and will be required to leave if they do not find work within six months. Migrants will be able to claim tax credits and child benefit and to apply for social housing only after four years in the country, and will receive no child benefit or child tax credit for offspring living abroad . 'If you elect me as Prime Minister in May, I will negotiate to reform the European Union, and Britain's relationship with it,' said Mr Cameron. 'This issue of free movement will be a key part of that negotiation. 'If I succeed, I will, as I have said, campaign to keep this country in a reformed EU. 'If our concerns fall on deaf ears and we cannot put our relationship with the EU on a better footing, then of course I rule nothing out. 'But I am confident that, with goodwill and understanding, we can and will succeed.' David Cameron took a swipe at the Ukip, under Nigel Farage (pictured) warning voters to 'distrust those who sell the snake oil of simple solutions' Speaking in Staffordshire a day after official statistics showed net migration rising to 260,000 over the past year - 16,000 higher than when the coalition Government came to office - Mr Cameron conceded that his policies had 'not been enough' to meet the Conservative target of cutting overall numbers to the tens of thousands by 2015. But he insisted that his reforms had made 'a real difference', cutting numbers of migrants from outside the EU by as much as 50,000. He promised to 'go further' if he wins next year's election, by revoking the licences of colleges whose students overstay visas, extending 'deport first, appeal later' rules and requiring landlords to check tenants' immigration status. 'The ambition remains the right one. But it's clear: it's going to take more time, more work and more difficult long-term decisions to get there,' said Mr Cameron. In a clear swipe at the UK Independence Party, which has built support by highlighting public concerns over immigration, the Prime Minister warned voters to 'distrust those who sell the snake oil of simple solutions'. Denouncing as 'appalling' any suggestion of repatriating legal migrants, Mr Cameron said Britain was great 'because of immigration, not in spite of it', and insisted he was proud of the UK's openness to incomers and its creation of 'a successful multi-racial democracy'. The isolationism of those who want to 'pull up the drawbridge' and shut off immigration altogether is 'actually deeply unpatriotic', he said. 'For the sake of British jobs, British livelihoods and British opportunities we must fight this dangerous and misguided view that our nation can withdraw from the world and somehow all will be well,' said Mr Cameron. But he also warned against the 'dangerous' idea that immigration is not a problem and that it is racist to voice anxiety about it. 'We should be clear,' said the Prime Minister. 'It is not wrong to express concern about the scale of people coming into the country. 'People have understandably become frustrated. It boils down to one word: control. People want Government to have control over the numbers of people coming here and the circumstances in which they come, both from around the world and from within the European Union. 'They want control over who has the right to receive benefits and what is expected of them in return. They want to know that foreign criminals can be excluded - or if already here, removed. And they want us to manage carefully the pressures on our schools, our hospitals and our housing. 'If we are to maintain this successful open meritocratic democracy we treasure, we have to maintain faith in Government's ability to control the rate at which people come to this country. 'And yet in recent years, it has become clear that successive governments have lacked control. 'People want grip. I get that. And I completely agree.' Mr Cameron's speech in the JCB factory in Rocester was briefly interrupted by an alarm bell, which he joked must have been triggered by a direct link to the European Commission in Brussels.

"Mystery: This old photograph of an unknown military man was tucked into the collar of a stray pit bull found in North Carolina . Animal rescuers have been left baffled after finding a stray dog wandering the streets of South Carolina with a black and white photograph of a soldier tucked into its collar. Staff at Greenville County Animal Care found the tan pit bull, thought to be around two-years-old, had no microchip or other identification when it was brought to the centre earlier this month. However when they checked his collar, they discovered an old picture of a man wearing military uniform sitting on a railing. Susan Bufano from the shelter, said there are no further clues as to who the man is or why the photograph was placed into the collar of the dog, which staff have named 'Soldier'. She said: 'It's so bizarre. Anything is possible.' Explaining that the collar had an unusual design, Bufano told ABC news: . 'It’s a really wide collar, canvas, and . it’s got an opening. I can’t imagine this photo . made it in there on accident.' In a bid to find clues, Animal Care posed the old photograph and a picture of the dog on their Facebook page. Some have speculated that Soldier, who Belfano described as being 'really friendly with people and just a really nice dog', may belong to a homeless veteran. Other comments on the Facebook page suggest the man may be holding a knife in his right hand, while others have speculated it is a shadow or wrinkle on his uniform. Despite the media attention the story has so far attracted, Greenville County Animal Care is yet to find out more about the puppy's mysterious past. The shelter hopes that the young dog, who is in a healthy condition, can be reunited or find a new home soon.

"Thousands of children are starting secondary school unable to run, jump, throw a ball or catch, the head of UK Sport has said. Susan Campbell has claimed 'physically illiterate' children 'hardly move' by the time they are ready to make the transition from primary school. And she said the legacy of the Olympics in the summer could be lost if teachers in primary schools did not receive specialist PE training. Baroness Campbell (left) has said thousands of children are starting secondary school unable to run, jump, throw a ball or catch, and has called for extra training in PE for primary school teachers . The head of UK Sport said some children 'hardly move' by the time they leave primary school . She warned some 11-year-olds aren't able to take part in the most basic of sports by the time they go to secondary school. Baroness Campbell, chairwoman of UK Sport and the Youth Sport Trust, said sport should be taken as seriously as literacy and numeracy in primary schools. And she has called for primary school teachers to receive extra training in PE. She told the London Evening Standard while there was enthusiasm among youngsters to get involved in sport after the Olympics, they may miss out because of a lack of training among primary school teachers. Baroness Campbell said about 20 per cent of pupils aged five are overweight when they start school, and the statistics only get worse as they make their way through school. She said: 'Some secondary school teachers have 11-year-old pupils who hardly move, let alone catch or run. Baroness Campbell has said sport should be taken as seriously as literacy and numeracy at primary levels . 'If a teacher has ten children out of 30 like that in the class, it is a job to give them the focus they need. 'They can’t catch, throw, jump or run — the fundamental basic movements of every sport.' Speaking before the North of England Education Conference, in Sheffield, Baroness Campbell said primary school teachers receive minimal training in PE, with most saying they do not feel confident in giving lessons in the subject. The Department for Education has said competitive sport is being placed at the centre of its reforms of schools, according to The Telegraph. It said it was looking to raise the status of sport in primary schools and was staging an Olympic-style school games.

"The way you use Facebook and Twitter could mirror how narcissistic you are, according to a new university study. Research by the University of Michigan examined how social media websites reflect a growing culture of narcissism in the US. Scientists found that middle-aged narcissists are more likely to frequently update their Facebook status, while their younger counterparts take to Twitter to satisfy their vanity. So vain: Adult narcissists are more likely to use Facebook to gain the approval of their peers to boost their ego, according to new research . According to Elliot Panek, who was one of three scientists behind the research, middle-aged people use Facebook as a way of gaining approval of their image from their peers, while college students prefer Twitter because they over-value their own opinions. He said of middle-aged Facebook users: 'It's about curating your own image, how you are seen and also checking on how others respond to this image. 'Middle-aged adults usually have already formed their social selves, and they use social media to gain approval from those who are already in their social circles.' According to the study, Twitter acts as a megaphone for younger web users. Ego boost: Younger social media users are more likely to take to Twitter because they overvalue their own opinions . Mr Panek said: 'Through Twitter they're trying to broaden their social circles and broadcast their views about a wide range of topics and issues.' For part of the study, which looked at whether narcissism was related to how long we spend on Facebook and twitter each day, researchers looked at the social media activity of 486 college undergraduates. Participants, with an average age of 19, took a personality assessment measuring types of narcissism including exhibitionism, self-sufficiency and authority as well as charting their social media use. Online mirror: The study was unable to decipher whether social media makes users more narcissistic or the other way around . According to Science Daily, a second group of 93 adults with an average age of 35 also had to complete an online survey. The results showed that college students and their adult counterparts use social media in different ways to boost their self-esteem. The researchers however, could not tell whether narcissism leads to an increase in social media use or vice versa.","New research examines link between social media and narcissism .

"A Tennessee woman has been charged with murder for allegedly luring a young mother from Georgia to her death in a twisted plot to kidnap her two children and claim them as her own. Law enforcement officials in Catoosa County held a press conference Wednesday morning unveiling the charges against Catherine Goins, 37, who is accused of shooting dead Natalia Roberts, 30, last week. Goins, of Hixson, Tennessee, had pretended she was pregnant and called police last Friday claiming she had shot an intruder inside her ex-boyfriend’s home. Twisted plot: Catherine Goins, 37 (left), is facing murder charges after police say she shot dead mother-of-two Natalia Roberts (right), 30, so she could claim her two children as her own . Lured to her death: Officials say Goins brought Roberts to her ex-boyfriend's house in La Fayette, Georgia, under the pretense of wanting to give her some baby clothes . But an investigation has revealed that Goins’ home invasion story was nothing but a lie concocted to cover up a disturbing abduction plan, Catoosa County Sherif Gary Sisk told reporters, according to the station WRCB . Investigators say Goins met Natalia Roberts, a mother of two, last Friday morning and lured her to the La Fayette home of her former paramour, Tony Richards, claiming she had some baby clothes for her. When Roberts showed up at 227 Smoketree Circle sometime between 11am and 1pm, Goins allegedly shot her in the back of the head from a .380 caliber handgun as they were walking down a flight of stairs. Before fleeing the crime scene with the victim's two young children in tow, Goins allegedly tried to cover up her tracks and called her ex-boyfriend, Tony Richards, telling him she had shot someone inside his residence. 'We're calling it murder because that's what it is,' Sheriff Sisks told reporters. 'She flat-out murdered her.' Young mom: Roberts (far right) was a mother to a three-week-old baby and a three-year-old toddler . In cold blood: Sheriff's officials say Goins shot the woman (pictured) in the back of the head and then took off in her car with the victim's two children . The sheriff added that Catherine Goins’ most recent boyfriend broke up with her after discovering that she had been lying to him about being pregnant, so she decided to present Roberts’ three-week-old baby as her own. When Tony Richards returned home, he discovered a woman’s lifeless body on his property and called 911. He then contacted Goins, who was fleeing with Roberts’ two children, and convinced to return. By the time police officers responded to the crime scene, the 37-year-old suspect made her way back to the La Fayette home. Gruesome sight: When the owner of the house returned home, he found Roberts' lifeless body . When interviewed by police, Goins reportedly said she was at Richards’ house when she heard a noise. She ran to the bedroom, grabbed a gun and shot at a ‘darkened shadow’ in the hallway, according to Northwest Georgia News. Catherine Goins was arrested Tuesday in Tennessee on charges of malice murder; felony murder; tampering with evidence, and possessions of a firearm during the commission of a crime. Natalia Roberts' two children, a 3-year-old and a 3-week old, are currently staying with family members.","Catherine Goins, 37, is facing murder charges in the shooting death of Natalia Roberts, 30, a mother of two from Georgia .

"Multi-millionaire Reade Griffith has been ordered to pay more than £800,000 to build two-storey basement . A hedge fund manager has been ordered to pay a fee of more than £800,000 to create a huge two-storey underground basement below his mansion. The unprecedented levy on a basement excavation has shocked property experts and appears to mark the beginning of a council fightback against the creation of ‘iceberg homes’ in exclusive areas. Multi-millionaire Reade Griffith, 48, and his wife Elizabeth, 42, plan to build a vast subterranean extension underneath two adjoining Kensington townhouses at an estimated cost of £4million. Housing a swimming pool, spa and ‘treatment ‘area’ it is likely to add £10million to the value of the property. At about 900 square metres, the basement would be the equivalent to eight average-sized new-build family homes. But due to the sheer scale of the extension, Kensington and Chelsea Council asked for a one-off fee of £825,000 when it granted planning permission earlier this month. According to planning documents seen by the Daily Mail, the fee will go towards affordable housing elsewhere in the borough. Such payments – known as ‘Section 106 agreements’ – are normally confined to large-scale commercial developments of housing estates. It is highly unusual for them to be applied to single private planning applications. Their extension to domestic homes could be seen as a new tax on wealthy homeowners, who already pay 7 per cent stamp duty on property purchases over £2million, and could enrage well-heeled residents looking to expand their properties in exclusive parts of  London. Kensington and Chelsea Council ordered the Section 106 payment to grant permission for the build that will add up to £10million to Griffith's mansion (pictured) The . project has been applied for in the name of Mrs Griffith, who owns one . of the properties. Her husband, founder of Polygon Investment Partners, . once one of London’s most high-profile funds, owns the neighbouring . house through a company. The two properties have 13 bedrooms between . them. The proposed . development will see the build of a ‘double level basement extension . under both buildings and extending under the small front and rear . gardens whilst respecting the tree protection areas’, according to . planning documents. Architects’ drawings show how the vast . house will include a plunge pool, spa pool, a cinema room, games room, . bar and even a wine store. Both of the houses are listed as . ‘buildings of local interest’ in an area that has ‘become highly . desirable as a residential location’. The . proposal reads: ‘Our clients wish to create two dwellings suitable for . contemporary living, and to enhance the appearance of the buildings by . reinstating lost architectural detailing and adding an appropriately . designed first floor extension’. Stuart . Robinson, head of planning at the CBRE, the global property agents, . said the move by the council to ask for a fee to build the extension was . unusual. Plan that shows how the vast extension would look when it is completed . He said: ‘This is completely off the scale. You don’t normally get these agreements with residential applications.’ Gary Sector, legal director for law firm Addleshaw Goddard, said the sum appeared to be ‘unprecedented’ for a domestic renovation. The planning application reflects the trend for London’s most wealthy homeowners to extend downwards after being faced with the high cost of moving house and the perception among many overseas buyers that London houses lack sufficient space. Planning requests for ‘dig-downs’ have soared in Kensington and Chelsea in the last decade, rising from 13 in 2001 to 307 in 2012. Some boroughs are now starting to fight back against giant basements amid fears about the noise and disruption caused. Alan Waxman, founder of Landmass London, a residential designer and developer, said owners were unlikely to be put off by the council’s levy. He said: ‘If they are building around 1,000 square metres that could be worth some £10million, so even if it cost £4million to do and the fee is £800,000 the owner could still double their money.’","Reade Griffith ordered to pay fee to install two-storey basement .

"This wreck may give vintage car enthusiasts a sinking feeling. Trapped beneath the waves is a trove of classic British vehicles which were lost when the cargo vessel carrying them was sunk in the Second World War. The SS Thistlegorm, a British Merchant Navy ship, sank after it was bombed by two German planes in 1941. The rusting 128-metre-long vessel has lain 30 metres beneath the surface of the Red Sea for 73 years. Scroll down for video . Motorbikes inside the hold of the SS Thistlegorm, a British Merchant Navy ship that sank after it was bombed by two German planes in 1941 . Loaded on the ship were a wide range of military vehicles which were being transported by the ship from Glasgow to Alexandria, Egypt . The vessel has lain 30 metres beneath the surface of the Red Sea for 73 years . Still contained within the rusting cargo hold are a wide range of military vehicles which were being transported by the ship from Glasgow to Alexandria, Egypt. British diver Mark Harris, 53, explored the popular site. He said: 'This dive was a quiet one, so it gave me some time for contemplation. 'Shipwrecks like this, even though they are physically decaying in one sense, also preserve a moment in time - an act of war. 'You rarely see this on land. Buildings damaged during wars are rebuilt and holes made by bombs are filled in. 'Down here, the twisted wreckage and torn decks are still a good representation of how the vessel was as she slipped beneath the waves.' British Merchant Navy ship the SS Thistlegorm sank after it was bombed in 1941 . The wreck was lost to the depths of the sea until it was discovered in 1956 by legendary aquatic explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau . Aquatic explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau wrote about diving the wreck in part of his book, The Living Sea . Swathes of tropical fish swim around the remains of the well-preserved wreck which still contains historic vehicles such as Bedford trucks, armoured vehicles, Norton 16H and BSA motorcycles, Bren guns and cases of ammunition. Also amongst the relics lying on the sea bed are aircraft parts, radio equipment, wellington boots and even two steam locomotives intended for use on the Egyptian railways. Mr Harris, of Esher, Surrey, said: 'As divers, we feel the ship’s wounds. Most of us respect the site. That is why that Wellington boot was still there after all this time, and not looted. Here was something easily removable, that had been left to rest in peace.' The Thistlegorm was travelling as a part of a convoy, which offered protection against Italian and German warships . The SS Thistlegorm, built in 1940 in Sunderland, set sail for the last time from Glasgow on June 2, 1941 . There were 41 crew members aboard in total when the ship went down during the Second World War . The ship sank following an explosion in the main hold which was triggered when ammunition on board ignited . The SS Thistlegorm, built in 1940 in Sunderland, set sail for the last time from Glasgow on June 2, 1941. The crew of the ship, captained by William Ellis, was accompanied by nine Royal Navy personnel who manned the ship’s defensive guns. There were 41 crew members aboard in total. The Thistlegorm was travelling as a part of a convoy, which offered protection against Italian and German warships which were hunting cargo vessels in the Mediterranean at the time. Two bombed were dropped on the Thistlegorm, which was the largest ship in the convoy . After the ship refuelled in Cape Town, the convoy was supposed to continue on to Egypt via the Suez Canal. However, the ship could not pass through the canal as there was a collision further ahead. The SS Thistlegorm moved to Safe Anchorage F, near Ras Muhammad in Egypt, in September. The ship remained there until October 6 when it was bombed while still at anchor. At the time German intelligence believed that a ship carrying extra allied troops was approaching Egypt. Two Heinkel HE-111 aircraft were dispatched by the Germans from Crete with the mission to find and destroy the troop carrier. The search failed but on the way back the planes targeted the vessels anchored at Safe Anchorage F, dropping two bombs on the Thistlegorm, which was the largest ship in the convoy. The ship sank following an explosion in the main hold which was triggered when ammunition on board ignited. In total four members of the merchant crew perished, along with five members of the supplementary Navy crew serving on the ship. Captain Ellis was awarded an OBE for his actions and another crew member, Angus McLeary, was awarded the George Medal and the Lloyd’s War Medal for Bravery at Sea after he saved another man’s life. The wreck was lost to the depths of the sea until it was discovered in 1956 by aquatic explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau who wrote about diving the wreck in part of his book, The Living Sea.

"When a gentle spot of fishing is interrupted by a five-metre crocodile, the first thing most people would do is run for the safety of dry land. But when 18-year-old Dylan Case came face to face with this maneater, he was cool-headed enough to take a picture - showing the beast with a barramundi in its jaws. He took the amazing snap two years ago but it went viral last week after he posted it to Instagram accounts fishtildeath and Fishing FNQ, immediately attracting hundreds of likes. The 5m crocodile devours the barramundi, stealing the catch from Dylan Case . And rather than be scared off by his close encounter, Dylan, from Newell Beach, northern Queensland, is still annoyed he lost out on his prize catch. ‘We were fishing off a bank on a lagoon near Kalpower (in the Lakefield National Park) and we saw these bubbles coming up,’ Dylan told the Gold Coast Bulletin. ‘Suspecting it was a smaller croc, we kept casting and I hooked that fish right next to the bubbles. ‘I fought the fish to the bank but couldn’t drag it up. We usually hook them with a long-handed gaff but we decided to wait and see what the bubbles did just in case.’ Newell's Beach, north Queensland, where the crocodile struck . ‘The croc just lunged out of the water at us, coming within one metre or so from me, before sliding backwards into the water. It saw the barra floundering on the edge and picked it up and sat right there crushing it. You could hear the fish’s bones cracking.’ It was at this point that the cool-headed teen took the picture. After the croc had finished his meal he snapped the line as it swam away. ‘I was pretty shaken up by it,’ Dylan said.","Dylan Case, 18, confronted by crocodile while fishing in north Queensland .

"Arsene Wenger is not intending to sign a replacement for injured striker Olivier Giroud - with Besiktas match-winner Alexis Sanchez proving he is more than capable of leading the line for the Gunners. Giroud underwent ankle surgery on Wednesday afternoon and could be sidelined until the new year, with Arsenal already linked to a number of targets to come in and take over from the 27-year-old. But it was summer recruit Sanchez who scored the only goal of a tense Champions League play-off as Wenger sealed a 17th consecutive season in the group stages of the competition despite having Mathieu Debuchy sent off in the second half.

'He was mobile and dangerous and showed he has great fighting spirit - qualities which will be important in the Premier League.'

"Mobile operator EE has switched on the world's fastest 4G network in East London today, capable of reaching speeds of up to 300Mbps. The technology is being trialled in East . London before being rolled out further next year and is ten times faster than basic 4G speeds . currently being offered. The company has faced stiff competition recently from O2 and Vodafone after the rival operators switched on their respective 4G services - a stronghold EE held for almost a year. EE's new network has launched in London and can reach speeds of 300Mbps - its basic 4G speeds currently range from 24 to 30Mbps. Further expansion plans have not been announced but EE said the technology is due to become 'commercially available when compatible devices launch from mid-2014' The new speeds, in theory, mean Blu-ray and high-definition videos can be downloaded in seconds and won’t buffer during playback. Webpages should also load instantly. The technology will make streaming content online, such as on the BBC iPlayer, up to four times faster than current speeds and users will be able to share higher-resolution, larger pictures and videos quicker. EE was the first operator to launch a 4G network in the UK in October 2012, followed by O2 and Vodafone earlier this year. EE’s basic 4G speeds range between 24 and 30Mpbs. Following the 4G announcements from O2 and Vodafone, EE said it would be offering double speeds to its customers in certain areas - raising its top speed to 60Mbps. The latest network peaks at 300Mbps and runs on LTE-Advanced technology through the world’s first CAT 6 Huawei router. The router can offer superfast speeds to up to twenty phones, tablets and other devices. EE, which was formed from the merger of Orange and T-Mobile, was the first company to offer a 4G network in the UK. EE . held the monopoly on the network because regulator Ofcom gave it . permission to use existing spectrum (1800MHz) that it already owned. Ofcom . then held an auction for companies to bid to use other parts of the . spectrum from 800MhZ to 2.6GHz. O2 purchased 800MHz lots and Vodafone . won both 800MHz and 2.6GHz lots. For . the typical user, download speeds of initial 4G networks should be at . least five to seven times faster than those of existing 3G networks. In . July, EE announced it was doubling its 4G speeds for people in . Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Derby, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, . Liverpool, London, Manchester, Nottingham and Sheffield. The speed boost makes the network twice as fast as current average 4G speeds and 10 times as fast as 3G. Vodafone and O2 both switched on their respective networks at the end of August. Mobile . network Three has kicked off a price war earlier this week over the new . 4G service by announcing it will offer the super high-speed internet at . no extra cost. The firm’s . 1.5million customers will get 4G at the same price they pay for the . current 3G network, with packages of calls, texts and unlimited internet . from £15 a month. The Three deal will start mid-December, cashing in on Christmas handset sales. As with all mobile and broadband contracts, these speeds are called ‘optimal’ and come with the caveat of ‘up to’. The speeds shown are the greatest possible speeds available on that network, but realistically customers won't be able to reach these. What it does mean is that even if customers are getting a proportional speed boost on a network such as the one launched by EE today, the boost will still be higher than on other networks. The EE 300Mbps 4G network covers Tech City from launch, but EE said it will be rolled out across London throughout 2014. Further . expansion plans have not been announced but EE said the technology is . due to become ‘commercially available when compatible devices launch . from mid-2014.’ The latest EE network peaks at 300Mbps and runs on LTE-Advanced technology through the world's first CAT 6 Huawei router. EE recently celebrated it first birthday. The network has over 1.2million 4G customers and covers 131 towns and cities - approximately 60 per cent of the population . It is expected the first Huwaei mobile Wi-Fi units will launch by the summer 2014, for example, with handsets featuring the technology due by the fourth quarter. EE CEO Olaf Swantee said: 'Our existing 4G network delivers incredible mobile data speeds and covers millions of people across the country, but we never stand still. 'Our analysts predict that data usage will grow significantly over the next three years. In fact, our trend-mapping shows that data usage is set to rise by 750 per cent in that period, as consumers and companies conduct more of their business and lives on-line. 'The network we’re switching on in Tech City uses the spectrum we acquired in the Ofcom spectrum auction earlier this year, and is the first part of an infrastructure that can meet the future demands of an increasingly data-hungry nation, enabling us to stay one-step ahead of the demand.'

"Chilly winter weather is finally on its way as temperatures are set to drop next week - and we could even see the first snow of the winter. Forecasters are predicting that the higher grounds in Scotland could get a dusting of snow on Monday night, as temperatures plummet to those typical for December. It follows a balmy November and a year of unusual weather, with this autumn on track to be the third warmest since records began. Temperatures dipped to as low as -1C in parts of the country overnight, with frost and fog due to set in next week. Scroll down for video . Winter is on its way as temperatures are set to drop on Monday, following a balmy November. Pictured is a frosty start in the Peak District . Highland cows in the Peak District bear the brunt of the frost, which swept in this week, and it's only set to get colder as December approaches . The coldest temperatures were recorded in Scotland where it was -1.3C in Aviemore. Much of England and Wales enjoyed a milder night, with minimum temperatures of 7 and 8C across large parts of the country. Bournemouth and Southampton were warmer still at around 11C at 6am today. However a large, frosty front will sweep over the country next week after dumping the first of the winter snow in Scotland. 'While all the cloud maintains itself in northern parts, there are outbreaks of showery rain in the north and subsequently the temperatures are more suppressed as it pushes its way south eastwards (over England and Wales), weakening all the while,' said Met Office forecaster Calum MacColl. 'We'll see some mist and fog developing across central and south eastern England where it'll be a dull, dull start tomorrow. 'Some fog may linger while further north it brightens up later. The colder weather won't show its hand until Monday, pushing south eastwards increasing the risk of frost.' The weekend will be warmer than average for the time of year but temperatures will start to drop towards the December average of 6C from Monday. Met Office meteorologist, Greg Dewhurst, added: 'We could possibly see a little bit of snow on the highest ground of the Highlands on Monday night from incoming showers. 'Elsewhere, most places will be cold and dry and there will be some mist and fog about too.' Forecaster Nicola Maxey said: 'On Saturday we are looking at highs of 13C or 14C during the day, which we will see in the south of England. We may possibly even see 15C. 'In Northern Ireland we are looking at highs between 11C and 12C, 9C and 11C in the North East, and similar temperatures in Scotland. A cyclist heads to work in Nottinghamshire as temperatures tumble. Forecasters say this weekend will be warm before average December temperatures of around 6C creep in on Monday - the first day of December . The average temperature for November is 9C, but this weekend will see temperatures reach a milder 11C to 12C on Saturday across the UK . The cold front will start off in Scotland in early hours and move slowly down, passing South West around midnight, according to forecasters . The mist rises around Malmesbury Abbey in Wiltshire, which basks in a red light from the rising sun, as colder winter weather creeps in . A misty start for deer in Richmond, south-west London, as they embrace the colder temperatures while the country heads towards winter . 'The average temperature for the UK in November is 9C, so we are still looking at above average temperatures. 'On Sunday we will see a slight drop in temperatures, for example London and the South will be looking at highs of 11C or 12C, and between 10C and 11C in Scotland. 'On Monday we will start to see temperatures drop throughout the UK. The average temperature for December throughout the UK is 6C, so we are still looking at above average temperatures throughout the week, so for instance we are looking at temperatures between 8C and 9C in London on Monday. 'But temperatures will drop slightly throughout the week, moving closer towards the average temperature for the month. 'However, we have an area of high pressure over the UK and we are likely to see nice weather throughout the week. We are looking at periods of sunshine in between the clouds, and we are looking at nice, dry winter days.' Some parts of the country could see snow on Monday night as temperatures drop to December average. Pictured, a foggy start in Cambridge . Cyclists in Cambridge on a foggy November morning, where temperatures were milder than average, making it likely that this month could be one of the warmest November's on record . A couple walk their dog in the park in Cambridge as the fog hangs low. The first half of November also saw slightly higher than usual rainfall . 'We do have a weak front that comes over the UK on Monday. It will start off in Scotland in the early hours and move slowly down through the country throughout the day, passing through to the Midlands and then it will reach the South West around midnight. 'But it is only a weak front, so its likely to be light rain we are looking at more than anything else. Other than periods of light rain, it should be fairly clear otherwise.' 'We expect to see 121mm of rain throughout the UK in the whole of November.. But, up until November 16th, we had seen 93mm of rain, which is 77 per cent of the average monthly total.' The Environment Agency has two flood alerts in place in the south east. While early statistics from the Met Office have revealed that this autumn is on track to be the third warmest on record for the UK, but rainfall is close to average. The mean temperature between September 1 and November 25 was 10.8C, which is 1.4C above average, meaning it currently ranks behind 2006 (11.4C) and 2011 (11.3C) in the digital UK records dating back to 1910. The mild conditions through autumn follow on from a generally warm year overall, with all months except August having seen above average temperatures.

"An exhausted kestrel which found itself 25 miles out to sea hitched a ride back to shore on the shoulder of a yachtswoman. Carol Raffe, 57, was sailing to the Suffolk coast from the Netherlands with husband Max Raffe, 55, when she felt a tapping on her neck. She turned to her left and saw the large bird of prey - normally only found on dry land - staring back at her. Hitching a ride: A wayward kestrel landed on a Suffolk couple's yacht in the middle of the North Sea . 'Like a seasoned sailor': Having tried and failed to take flight again, the bird settled down in the cockpit . The kestrel, which they've since nicknamed Lucky, then hopped onto the deck of the  30ft Cornish pilot cutter before becoming spooked and taking off again. But the battered bird could only circle the mast once before flopping into the water. Fortunately it mustered enough energy to flap back on board, and sat with its new shipmates for the next four hours. It eventually left Carol and Max as they sailed into the mouth of the river Deben, Suffolk. It is believed the wayward animal had been blown off course by strong easterly winds. Carol, an occupational therapist of Crowfield, Suffolk, said: 'There was nothing in sight except a nearby wind farm. Exhausted: The bird eventually left the yacht four hours later, when it reached the river Deben . 'So I was completely stunned when the bird landed my shoulder. We just could not work out how a land bird was so far out at sea. 'My shock must have made it decide to move off and it then settled among the coiled mainsheet by my side. 'We tried to give her food as she looked absolutely famished but it seemed to spook her and she took flight - weirdly landing on the water. 'As she is a land bird we became terrified that she might drown as she would have no natural swimming skills. 'But she managed to regain herself before landing on my husband’s shoulder and then settled down on the boat and stayed with us for four-and-a-half hours. 'She was like a seasoned sailor and just pottered about the boat and did seem to care about us at all. 'She must have realised we posed no threat and were her only chance of survival. The kestrel eventually left us when we reached the River Deben. 'She then flew top Ramsholt Church which overlooks the river, perhaps for a quick prayer of thanksgiving or more likely a hunt for a long awaited meal of Church mouse.' Max, a local Scout leader and technical designer for BT, was astonished when the bird landed on his wife’s shoulder. He said: 'I could not believe it. It is odd to see a bird of prey so far out to see but for it to land on my wife’s shoulder completely out of the blue is just incredible. 'There was a strong easterly wind at the time so we think it must have been blown out to sea from the Suffolk coat. 'It would have died if our boat was not there. You hear about these stories out at sea but you never think they will happen to you - it was really fascinating.' Kestrels are usually found in open farm land or near uncultivated grassland. They are a a bird of prey and tend to eat field voles, mice, shrews, moles, rats, frogs, and lizards. The species is in decline in the UK due to the loss of food and farmland habitat.","Max and Carol Raffe sailing 30-ft yacht from Netherlands to Britain .

"Ander Herrera was given a tour of Manchester United's Carrington training ground along with his entourage on Wednesday. The 24-year-old midfielder also had his photographs taken for the club website ahead of the official announcement of his £28.7million transfer from Athletic Bilbao. The Spaniard stepped off a train at Stockport just after 1.30pm to be met by United security staff before being whisked away with his representatives and friends to Manchester. Wanted man: Manchester United have made a second move to sign Athletic Bilbao midfielder Ander Herrera . Bright future: Herrera (right), pictured in action against Barcelona, becomes Louis van Gaal's first signing . Race against time: Herrera's buyout clause at Athletic Bilbao was set to increase on June 30 . VIDEO Ander Herrera set to sign for Manchester United . Herrera has become Louis van Gaal’s first signing as Manchester United manager. United moved to pay the buy-out clause . fee for the 24-year-old Athletic Bilbao midfielder on Tuesday, with the . player signing a four-year contract. Former club Real Zaragoza are due £1million sell-on fee as part of the deal. Herrera, an intelligent and stylish midfielder, was the subject of a £24m offer from David Moyes’s United last summer. At that time they did not believe it was worth paying the best part of £5m more to make the deal happen. United denied problems trying to sign Herrera last year — namely when three lawyers turned up at La Liga headquarters in an attempt to push through the transfer without knowledge of either club. They know the buy-out figure is due to rise to £32m from July 1 and Ed Woodward, the club’s executive vice-chairman, did not want another saga to drag on this summer. Herrera has been watched by United for more than three years, with Sir Alex Ferguson’s brother Martin among the first to bring him to the club’s attention. VIDEO Van Gaal set for German shopping spree . Forward planning: Incoming United boss Louis van Gaal is aiming to strengthen his squad this summer . Despite shelving the signing last August, Moyes had promised Herrera he would monitor his progress. A dip in form followed but he recovered to help propel Bilbao to fourth place in La Liga. Herrera, part of Spain’s Olympic squad at London 2012, was also a team-mate of United’s Juan Mata and David de Gea with Spain Under 21s. Van Gaal is already starting to put his mark on the squad, with Antonio Valencia and Patrice Evra both signing contract extensions. Fresh bid: United have made an improved offer for Southampton and England defender Luke Shaw . United have improved their original offer for Southampton and England left back Luke Shaw with a bid understood to be around £30m.

"A government investigation criticized a bizarre Secret Service assignment that pulled armed agents away from guarding the President and his family flying in Marine One and sent them to guard the home of a senior agent arguing with her neighbor instead. Indeed, according to Ronald Kessler's book, The First Family detail were diverted from watching Marine One at a time when intelligence reports had been received that a missile attack on the helicopter was being planned. The conduct amounted to a 'serious lapse in judgment,' the inspector general of the Homeland Security Department, John Roth, said in a statement, . 'These agents, who were there to protect the president and the White House, were improperly diverted for an impermissible purpose.' Agency officials have strenuously denied Barack Obama's safety was ever compromised. Scroll down for video . Family guard: Secret Service agents occupy cars outside the White House and are meant to guard for any outside attacks on Marine One as it lifts off from the lawn. In 2011 their posts were allegedly not manned . However, the report says that the president was at the White House on at least two days that the agents were 'a 50-minute drive (without traffic) from the White House and found no legal justification for using Secret Service agents for such a purpose. Compared to that failure and other incidents, including a prostitution scandal in Colombia, 'Operation Moonlight' stands as a strange side note. It happened three years ago but came to light this past May in a report in The Washington Post. A Secret Service employee who worked as the assistant to then-director Mark Sullivan was involved in a dispute with her neighbor, who was harassing her and assaulted her father. This 'resulted in the loss of several of her father's teeth,' the report says. Local police arrested the neighbor, and the employee, Lisa Chopey, sought out a protective order. But it didn't stop there. She told investigators that Keith Prewitt, then the deputy director of the Secret Service, was a family friend. And when he heard her story, Prewitt told A.T. Smith, then the assistant director for investigations, that the Secret Service should do something to help her out. Smith directed one of his managers to have agents drive out to Chopey's home in La Plata, Maryland to check on her. The report says that Sullivan, the agency director who's since retired, was made aware of that decision, but Sullivan disputed that in a statement Wednesday, saying that he'd only learned of the checks being made on Chopey after they'd already stopped. The agents assigned to the task were from the agency's so-called 'Prowler' unit, a rotating team of two special agents who are supposed to respond to suspicious people and situations in and around the White House and national capital area. Prowler teams are not part of the presidential protective division, and agency personnel interviewed for the report insisted their protective function was not compromised. The mission was over before long — five days of visits are documented, with the longest lasting eight hours. But the report notes that during those times, 'the Prowler team would have been unable to respond to exigencies at the White House.' And on at least two of those occasions, Obama was in the residence. A government investigation uncovered an operation that had Secret Service agents tasked with guarding the White House travelling an hour outside the city to help a coworker with a dispute with a neighbor, something agency deputy director A.T. Smith (above) was aware of . No one's watching: Two of the times that agents from the Prowler unit were away, President Obama (above) was in residence . The agents sent out were part of the Prowler unit, tasked with responding to suspicious people and situations in and around the White House and national capital area. The report by the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security is another embarrassment for the Secret Service, which is responsible for guarding the president and his family. Julia Pierson resigned as director of the agency this month after a series of scandals. The report said top Secret Service officials diverted agents on its plainclothes ""Prowler"" team, which patrols around the White House, on five days in July 2011 to monitor a fellow employee's personal dispute with a neighbor. President Barack Obama was in the White House on two of those days. ""These agents, who were there to protect the president and the White House, were improperly diverted for an impermissible purpose. This constituted a serious lapse in judgment,"" Inspector General John Roth said in a statement. The incident began when an unnamed employee in the director's office told her supervisor that an altercation with a neighbor had led to her father being assaulted, ""which resulted in the loss of several of her father's teeth,"" the seven-page report said. Keith Prewitt, the now-retired Secret Service deputy director, thought the agency should help the employee. A.T. Smith, then the assistant director for investigations and now deputy director, ordered security checks on the worker's home in rural Maryland, a 50-minute drive from the White House without traffic. This is all happening just a few weeks after Julia Pierson stepped down as head of the agency over numerous lapses in security . Roth's report found no legal or procedural justification for the checks and said the Secret Service should have stayed out of a dispute best handled by local police. The incident was reported by the Washington Post in May. Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary said the agency had received Roth's report to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and was reviewing it for findings. The inspector general's report comes a month after a U.S. veteran armed with a knife got inside the White House. That breach was followed by the revelation that an armed security contractor with a criminal record rode on an elevator with Obama last month, along with new details about a 2011 incident in which shots were fired at the White House. The agency's reputation also was tarnished in 2012 when it was reported that members had hired prostitutes in Colombia ahead of an Obama visit. Utah's Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who is leading investigations of the Secret Service as chairman of an oversight subcommittee, said that Smith should be fired .","A government investigation criticized a bizarre Secret Service assignment that pulled armed agents away from guarding the President .

"Constance Briscoe (pictured) was arrested after telling police she had not been in contact with the media about the story . A judge has been arrested over claims that she lied about her involvement in leaking information on Chris Huhne to the Press, it was revealed yesterday. Constance Briscoe, 55, was questioned over allegations that she lied to police during the investigation into whether former Cabinet minister Huhne asked his then wife Vicky Pryce to take his speeding points. Miss Briscoe, a neighbour and friend of Pryce, told police she had not been in contact with newspapers about the story. But emails revealed the barrister and part-time crown court judge was in contact with a freelance journalist, Andrew Alderson, who was working for the Mail on Sunday. Mr Alderson told the newspaper that Miss Briscoe was ‘determined to go for the kill’ against Huhne, who was then Energy Secretary in the Coalition Government. In an email, the freelance journalist  said Huhne would be forced to resign over the speeding points allegations and suggested he and a news editor on the paper should take the judge out for a ‘farewell to Huhne drink’. The revelation about Miss Briscoe – one of Britain’s most prominent black judges – came on the second day of the retrial of Huhne’s ex-wife for perverting the course of justice. The jury at Southwark Crown Court heard that Miss Briscoe was dropped as a witness because doubt had been cast on her ability to act as a ‘witness of truth’. Andrew Edis QC, prosecuting, said Pryce and Miss Briscoe ‘cooked up a plan’ to leak the speeding points story to the Press in 2010 in  revenge after Huhne left Pryce for his PR adviser Carina Trimingham. Miss Briscoe was a neighbour of the . couple in Clapham, south-west London, and became a close friend of Pryce . after the acrimonious break-up, as she had also been abandoned by her . partner. She acted as Pryce’s intermediary with the Mail on Sunday and . arranged a meeting between Pryce and a news editor in her legal . chambers. The jury heard Huhne, 58, angrily . denounced the judge as ‘batty’ as Pryce tried to catch him on tape . confessing to forcing her to take the points on her licence. The court heard Pryce (left), helped by Briscoe, told journalists about the story to get revenge on Huhne (right) after he left her for PR adviser Carina Trimingham in June 2010 . Mr Edis read a statement from . Detective Inspector Martin Passmore from Essex Police, explaining why . Miss Briscoe was not called as a witness in the first Pryce trial. He said: ‘Miss Briscoe has provided . statements to the police in this case but during the investigation it . became apparent that she may have lied about her involvement with the . Press, in that she denied having any contact with the Mail on Sunday or . any other media organisation in relation to this story. ‘Miss Briscoe has been arrested and is . currently under investigation by the police. Miss Briscoe could . therefore no longer be relied upon as a witness of truth.’ Detective Inspector Passmore said Mr . Alderson and his news editor Dave Dillon were not called as witnesses . because they had declined to give statements. The court heard they were entitled to . do so because ‘journalistic material’ was protected by law. There was no . suggestion of any wrongdoing by the Mail on Sunday. Pryce, 60, said she told the newspaper . that Huhne had forced his constituency aide Jo White to take the three . points so he would not lose his driving licence. She now admits she took the penalty . points herself in 2003 but denies perverting the course of justice as . she claims she was forced to do so because of ‘marital coercion’. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Jo White. Huhne is facing jail after he pleaded . guilty to perverting the course of justice. He has resigned as MP for . Eastleigh and will be sentenced later. The jury in Pryce’s first trial was discharged after it failed to reach a verdict. The retrial continues.

"Plenty of us enjoyed pinging rubber bands at unsuspecting school friends as children, but now one man has taken inspiration from his youth to create what he believes to be the ultimate office weapon. The Rubber Band Machine Gun is able to fire 672 rubber bands up to 26 feet (eight metres) at a rate of 14 shots a second from its 16 barrels. While such a weapon could no doubt inflict pain on a human target, the design student behind the toy is trying to raise money so that he can sell his wooden contraption to the public later this year. Scroll down for video . The rubber band machine gun (pictured) is able to fire 672 rubber bands up to 26 feet (eight metres) at a rate of 14 shots a second from its 16 barrels . The gun is powered by five AA batteries and can be reloaded with more ammunition in minutes. Design student Alex Shpetniy, 18, based his contraption on the Gatling gun - one of the world's first rapid-fire weapons. Originally invented by Richard Gatling, the forerunner to the modern machine gun is known for its use by the Union forces during the American Civil War in the 1860s, which was the first time it was employed in combat. Mr Shpetniy spent a year developing the toy - which he believes is the world’s most advanced rubber band gun - using skills he honed building model airplanes. The Ukrainian student is raising funds on Kickstarter and has attracted $70,000 of pledges more than the $5,000 he set out to gather, demonstrating the demand for such a DIY weapon. The gun is expected to go on sale this year for $140 (around £80). The rubber band machine gun, invented by design student Alex Shpetniy, is powered by five AA batteries and can be reloaded with more ammunition in minutes . String is wound onto the drum of the gun, passing through cuts in the barrels . Then up to 672 rubber bands are stretched over the string and the 16 barrels. An electric motor powered by five AA batteries reels off the string. This pulls off the rubber bands one by one, releasing them into flight with a range of up to 26 feet or eight metres. 'Everyone loved having rubber band fights as kids and now children of all ages can enjoy practising their shooting skills with a Rubber Band Machine Gun,’ Mr Shpetniy said. He explained that the automatic machine gun is made from birch plywood and cut out using a CNC (computer numerical control) machine, which allows a user to enter a design using a computer that is then cut out using a router. The gun comes in three colours: original birch, burnt wood and black.

"The bi-racial parents of a six-year-old who starred in a Cheerios advert have hit back against racists, saying they need to accept: 'We are part of the face of America'. Cheerios was forced to restrict online comments after posting the commercial on YouTube earlier this month, after a barrage of negative and racist comments. Christopher Colbert has reacted to the abuse aimed at his daughter Grace after she appeared in the national advert, saying: 'America needs to see this is just a way of life.' Scroll down for video: . Debate: Christopher and Janet Colbert talk about the reaction to Grace appearing in a Cheerios advert . Two weeks after the advert was aired - sparking a nationwide debate about mixed-race families - the Colberts talked to MSNBC about their experiences. Mr Colbert said: 'I wasn't upset or anything. I was pretty much really excited about having this type of reaction so we could see where we still stand in America.' He added that the first few comments on the online version of the advert had been good, before negative comments started to appear. The advert has been viewed more than 3.4 million times on YouTube. Before the comments were removed, 1,900 viewers had given the advert the thumbs down and, according to AdWeek, the site contained numerous references to Nazis, 'troglodytes' and 'racial genocide'. The commercial features a mixed-race girl asking her white mother if Cheerios are good for the heart before running out of the kitchen when she is told that they are. The shot then cuts to her black father waking from a nap to find a pile of Cheerios on his chest. The racist response to the advert has led to a debate about attitudes to mixed-race families. Abuse: The Cheerios advert starring Grace attracted racist abuse because it shows a mixed-race family . Reality: Cheerios chose to portray a mixed-race family to reflect the changing look of families in the U.S . A blogger on Jezebel wrote: '[It] is a huge step for interracial families like mine who want to be seen in public together and maybe eat some heart healthy snacks but it validates the existence of biracial and multiracial people.' And, in an opinion piece in Time magazine, the debate was described as being a sign of progress, MSNBC said. Mr Colbert said: 'There's many other things that we could talk about in America, but this still being an issue, people having a problem with whom I choose to love or whom you choose to love, it shouldn't be an issue any more.' He added that the debate around Grace's advert was exciting 'so we know what to look at and how to move forward and become a better America'. After stopping comments on the advert, the cereal company defended it decision to show a bi-racial family. 'At Cheerios, we know there are many kinds of families and we celebrate them all,' Camille Gibson, the vice-president of marketing at General Mills said. 'We were trying to portray an American family  and there are lots of multi-cultural families in America today.' Unfazed: Christopher Colbert with Grace, who believes the attention was caused by her smile . Data from federal surveys backs this up. Figures show there were 650,000 inter-racial married couples in 1980 but by 2009 that had risen to 2.5 million. For all the debate however, six-year-old Grace seems unfazed by the attention. She said filming the commercial had been fun, and that her school friends had seen it. When she asked her daughter about the attention her advert was receiving, Mrs Colbert said: '[Grace] actually just thought the attention was because she had a great smile. So she really had no idea.'

"Protecting moored ships from terrorists has proved a heavy load on the mind of naval commanders over the last decade. Now scientists may have found the answer - a robotic jet ski that can see underwater and travel at speeds of up to 40mph. The Blackfish craft is 10ft-long and can either be remote-controlled from a distance of up to one kilometre away or travel on pre-programmed routes. Scroll down for video . Blackfish: Scientists hope a robotic jet ski that can see underwater and travel at speeds of up to 40mph will protect moored ships from terrorist attacks . It is designed to prevent a suicide attack similar to Al-Qaeda's 2000 offensive on the U.S.S. Cole while it was docked in Yemen, an assault that claimed 17 lives. Navy ships are particularly vulnerable to small boats and swimmers and it is this Achilles' Heel that scientists at British defence contractor QinetiQ  hope the Blackfish will protect. Mark Hewitt, a spokesman for QinetiQ North America, told Discovery: 'In both domestic and foreign ports, there’s great concern about swimmers approaching the boats underwater. 'The Navy has been working on the problem for some time.' Engineers constructed the Blackfish by sawing the top half off a jet ski and equipping it with a video camera, underwater sonar and a surface radar - and possibly weapons sometime soon. The Blackfish is designed to prevent a suicide attack similar to Al-Qaeda's 2000 offensive on the U.S.S. Cole while it was docked in Yemen, an assault that claimed 17 lives . More problematic was redesigning the jet ski so that it can travel at a slow speed. Mr Hewitt said: 'It’s a jet ski, it goes fast. Human swimmers only go two knots. 'We solved the problem by adding bow thrusters, so you can turn off the main propulsion and track at low speeds.' The . Blackfish is also powered by a hydro-jet and not a propeller, so in the . unlikely event of a collision with an innocent swimmer, injuries should . be kept to a minimum. Perhaps . the greatest innovation is the pre-programmed patrol routes the . Blackfish can be sent on based on a GPS navigation system.

"Should scientists make the dreams of a million Star Trek fans come true by designing a spacecraft capable of travelling faster than the speed of light, it would be pretty frustrating to discover such a ship would obliterate any planet it landed on. But that is exactly what NASA researchers suspect could happen after new analysis revealed a flaw in designs for a so-called 'warp drive' - the theoretical technology that would propel spaceships to speeds faster than light - could cause catastrophic explosions the moment intrepid space explorers reached their destination. Rocket scientists at the Space Agency have been researching the possibility of a spaceship that could achieve warp speed travel via a real-life warp drive, the fantasy version of which is familiar to fans of Star Trek and other sci-fi shows. World of possibility: A so-called warp drive system could propel spacecraft like the Starship Enterprise to speeds faster than light . Equations based on the laws of relativity have allowed warp speed in theory; but the energy required to make it happen would require the energy-mass of a planet the size of Jupiter. Recently scientists studying the . model for a warp drive proposed by the Mexican physicist Miguel . Alcubierre concluded its power requirements were not as impossible as . once believed. But new research from the University . of Sydney has suggested that, while the warp drive could work, . disengaging the system at the end of a journey could prove extremely problematic. Bad news Scotty: Warp drive technology featured in the Star Trek series and other science fiction shows . Alcubierre's design features a ship made of a central pod surrounded by a large, flat ring - scientists are yet to establish what matter this ring would be made of, as it would need to be capable of bending the very fabric of the universe. Nonetheless they claim that, with enough energy, space and time can be bent to allow the spacecraft to travel through 'loops' in space. Warp drive: This design for a warp drive system features a central pod surrounded by a large flat ring . When activated, space behind the . drive would expand while that in front of the drive would contract. In . the meantime the ship would travel in a stable 'pocket', or 'bubble in . space', according to extremetech.com. Potential Death Star: A real-life warp drive could vaporise entire planets upon arrival, scientists say . But the Australian research indicates . that the high-energy particles that are constantly shooting around . space could get swept up in the ship's warp field and become trapped in . the 'bubble', with more and more of the particles filling the stable . pocket the longer the journey lasts. While this would no affect the . drive's ability to achieve warp speed, the instant it is disengaged that . space-time gradient allowing it to move faster than light - and . creating the bubble that holds the dangerous build-up of trapped . particles - is gone. Researchers now believe those particles would be blasted out in front of the ship, destroying anything around it. In theory, a long trip powered by a warp drive could see entire planets vaporised upon arrival. A lack of ability to reach light speed travel places limitations on fantasies of exploring the stars. While nothing can break the speed of light, scientists have long been fascinated by theories surrounding warp-speed travel.","Real-life version of the technology featured in Star Trek could cause a spacecraft to explode after propelling it through space to a distant planet .

"Only one child of an American Civil War veteran is alive today and receiving pensions for their parents' service, a Veteran's Affairs spokesperson exclusively told MailOnline. Though it was widely reported this week that two children of the veterans were getting an annual $876 pension from the Department, spokesman Randy Noller said that one of the two, a 93-year-old man living in Tennessee, died last August. The American Civil War ended on April 12, 1865 with the surrender of the Confederate Army, putting an end to the bloodiest battles ever fought on U.S. soil. Historic: Two children of Civil War soldiers still receive pensions from the government in the sum of $876 per year; here, casualties from 1862's Battle of Antietam are pictured . Mystery: The two children wish to remain anonymous; one lives in Tennessee and the other in North Carolina; they were likely born in the 1920s or 1930s . While the names of the two children have not been disclosed for privacy reasons, the male who passed away lived in Tennessee and was born around 1920. The other, a woman, was born around 1930 and lives in a nursing home in North Carolina. Speaking to MailOnline by phone from the VA's Washington headquarters, Mr Randy Noller said: 'The Department of Veterans Affairs provided benefits to two children of the Civil War veterans for the last several years. 'One unfortunately passed away last summer at the age of 93.' The story of the veterans came to light this after a larger report was published about the lingering costs of war and veterans' pensions on the 10th anniversary of the start of the war in Iraq. Famous last: Gertrude Janeway, the last Union Civil War widow, Gertrude Janeway, passed away in 2003, aged 93; she married husband at age 18 when he was 81 . Gail Crosby of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, which represents women whose fathers fought for the South during the conflict, told MailOnline that the surviving child qualified for benefits because she was disabled before she turned 18. ‘She is mentally challenged and has a bad limp but I don’t know if she was born that way or if something happened,’ Ms Crosby said. Veteran: Albert Woolson was the last surviving Union Civil War soldier and died in 1956 at the age of 109 . 'She is unable to communicate enough to even care for herself and her mother put her in a home before the mother passed away. She's been in this care home for the rest of her life with her little Civil War pension from her dad. ‘If she never married then she would have received this benefit for her entire lifetime, which it seems she has'. Ms Crosby added that she did not know which home the woman was in, or where exactly in North Carolina it was, as the historian who had kept her up to date died last year. The pension-holders' fathers would have had to have . been in their 70s or 80s if they served in the Civil War, meaning that . it is likely they re-married at an older age. The . last verified Civil War veteran, Albert Woolson, was 109 when he died . in 1956, while the last Civil War widow, Gertrude Janeway, passed away . in 2003, aged 93, though some dispute that she was the last living widow. Mrs Janeway had married her husband, John Janeway, when he was 81 and she was 18 and received a $70 pension check monthly. In earlier times, it was not unusual for much older men to marry much younger women, especially those who were widowed and needed support, or even those who were hoping to secure property and assets. Marrying age for women was also much lower – sometimes even in the teens. National Archives reference chief Trevor Plante told U.S. News last year that those in the Civil War era requiring pensions had to prove their relationship to the soldier in question. Surviving: According to the benefits roster of 2011, there are only two children left from Civil War soldiers, and 63 from the Spanish-American War of 1898 . ‘Civil War pensions are especially fascinating because of the wide array of things people submitted as evidence,’ he said, adding that there could be anything like marriage certificates, diaries, or photographs to prove that the women and children were related to the soldier in question. Circumstances similar to the two pensioners allow for the grandchildren of President John Tyler, who was born in 1790, to be alive today. His grandsons, Harrison Ruffin Tyler . and Lyon Gardiner Tyler Jr were born nearly 140 years after their . grandfather, the 10th president of the U.S. More . than $40billion each year is spent on compensation for veterans of the . Spanish-American War of 1898, World Wars I and II, the Korean War, the . Vietnam War, the two Iraq campaigns, and the war in Afghanistan. During . the Civil War, 617,000 Americans were killed – approximately the same . number as those who died in all of the wars up to that point, including . the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. Cost of war: The Department of Veterans Affairs continues to spend more and more on its war veterans, especially from the Vietnam era as well as the modern wars .","Two children of Civil War veterans received pensions from V.A. of $876 annually .

"Leeds have been served with a winding-up petition for unpaid fees dating back to when the club was owned by Ken Bates. Leeds-based law firm Ford & Warren has filed the petition for unpaid fees - reported to be around £150,000 - on behalf of former club director Melvyn Levi. The case is scheduled to be heard at Leeds Combined Court on January 13. Bates, 82, sold Leeds to Bahrain-based investment firm Gulf Finance House Capital in December 2012 and the club changed ownership again in April this year when Italian businessman Massimo Cellino completed his takeover. Leeds owner Massimo Cellino faces a winding-up petition of £150,000 from law firm Ford & Warren Solicitors . The petition has been served in relation to unpaid court fees. A case involving Levi was struck out in 2012 with the judge in the case ordering that Levi's fees be paid by the club. Nick Collins, a senior partner at Ford & Warren, told BBC Radio Leeds: 'This is not a dispute with Mr Cellino. 'This is something he has inherited from the previous ownership of the club. 'We bear no ill-will towards Mr Cellino and we wish him well. 'I genuinely hope we can resolve this amicably, but we must do what is necessary to protect our client's position.' The law firm are claiming for £150,000 in unpaid fees that date back to when Ken Bates (right) owned Leeds . Leeds refused to comment on the petition, but it is sure to add to current owner Cellino's problems. The Italian businessman faces an uncertain future after a judge in Sardinia was reported to have confirmed he acted dishonestly when failing to pay tax on his yacht earlier this year. Cellino was found guilty of tax evasion, but won an appeal against the Football League's decision to block his takeover at Elland Road under its owners' and directors' test. The appeal judge overruled the Football League but said in his report that if the judge in Sardinia confirmed the tax evasion had been a dishonest act in her written report, Cellino would fall foul of the fit and proper person's test. Leeds (right) are currently 17th in the Championship with no wins in their last eight matches . The league's board is understood to have discussed Cellino's case at a meeting on Thursday and will come under increasing pressure to apply its rules over the club's ownership. Cellino, who has been reported to have appealed against the Sardinian judge's findings, faces another court case in Italy for tax evasion on a second yacht. Leeds, currently 17th in the Sky Bet Championship, will bid for their first win in nine matches and their first under new head coach Neil Redfearn when they play Blackpool at home on Saturday.","The High Court have served the Elland Road club a winding-up petition .

"Researchers have found evidence of what could be the first carpenters at work. Archaeologists in Germany found the 7,000 year old wooden water wells near Leipzeg, . They are the oldest known wooden constructions in the world, and contradict the common belief that metal was necessary for complex timber constructions. The four constructions found near Leizeg, which are believed to be the earliest wooden constructions ever found . The farmers cleaved the trunks into boards, assembling them to make chest-like well linings with complex corner joints. Using . state-of-the-art laser scanning technology, the scientists collected . data on the timbers and tool marks and documented the highly developed . woodworking skills of the early Neolithic settlers. The very well-preserved tool marks and timber joints testify to unexpectedly sophisticated timber construction techniques. They were built by the Linear Pottery culture, which existed from roughly 5600 to 4900 BC. A research team led by Willy Tegel and Dr. Dietrich Hakelberg from the Institute of Forest Growth of the University of Freiburg has succeeded in precisely dating four water wells built by the first Central European agricultural civilization with the help of dendrochronology or growth ring dating. The team's findings, which have been . published in the international scientific journal PLoS ONE, give new . insight into prehistoric technology. The wells were excavated at settlements in the Greater Leipzig region and are the oldest known timber constructions in the world. The researchers were able to piece together exactly how the world's oldest carpenters made their water wells . 'A total of 151 oak timbers preserved in a waterlogged environment . were dated between 5469 and 5098 BC and reveal unexpectedly refined . carpentry skills,' the team said. 'The recently discovered water wells enable for the first time a . detailed insight into the earliest wood architecture and display the . technological capabilities of humans ~7000 years ago.' The study was conducted by archaeologists and dendrochronologists from the Institute of Forest Growth in Freiburg, the Archaeological Heritage Office of Saxony in Dresden, and the Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL in Birmensdorf, Switzerland. The four early Neolithic wells were constructed from oak wood. In addition to the timber, many other waterlogged organic materials, such as plant remains, wooden artifacts, bark vessels, and bast fiber cords, as well as an array of richly decorated ceramic vessels, have survived for millennia hermetically sealed below groundwater level. With the help of dendrochronology, the scientists were able to determine the exact felling years of the trees and thus also the approximate time at which the wells were constructed. The tests revealed that the wood comes from massive old oak trees felled by early Neolithic farmers with stone adzes between the years of 5206 and 5098 BC. Charred end grain surfaces at terminal ends of oak timbers from well A show the timbers were cut to length using fire . Researchers found a selection of preserved pots and even an ear of corn on the first of the four wells . The farmers cleaved the trunks into boards, assembling them to make chest-like well linings with complex corner joints, and using fire to cur them to size. Using state-of-the-art laser scanning technology, the scientists collected data on the timbers and tool marks and documented the highly developed woodworking skills of the early Neolithic settlers. The very well-preserved tool marks and timber joints testify to unexpectedly sophisticated timber construction techniques. In the course of the sixth millennium BC, the nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle gave way to a sedentary lifestyle with agriculture and stock breeding in Central Europe. This break in the history of . humankind has been termed the 'Neolithic Revolution.' A sedentary . lifestyle required permanent housing, and houses are inconceivable . without a developed woodworking technology. 'in other words, the first farmers were also the first carpenters,' the researchers wrote. 'Permanent settlement structures and agricultural production systems . required fundamental innovations in technology, subsistence, and . resource utilization.' Until now, however, archaeologists have only succeeded in unearthing the soil marks left by their houses. The . precisely dated wells will enable scientists to conduct more detailed . studies on the important role of timber construction techniques for . humankind's adoption of a sedentary lifestyle. 'Our results question the principle of continuous evolutionary . development in prehistoric technology, and contradict the common belief . that metal was necessary for complex timber constructions,' the researchers claimed.

"Loss: Audrie Pott, 15, killed herself last year after she was allegedly sexually assaulted at a party . A teenager who hanged herself after three classmates allegedly sexually assaulted her and circulated photos of the sickening attack desperately pleaded with the boys to delete the images in the days before her death, it has emerged. Audrie Pott, a 15-year-old from Saratoga, California, took her life in September 2012 after sending Facebook messages to the boys who allegedly assaulted her at an alcohol-fueled party. 'I swear to god if u still have those pictures illl killl u [sic],' she wrote to one of her alleged attackers in the days after the party. 'It's gonna get out.' Another male classmate responded: 'lol that s*** gets around haha everyone knows mostly everything hahaah.' Potts was found hanging in the bathroom of her mother's home on September 12, 2012 after the explicit photographs had allegedly led to bullying at school. Her devastated parents blame her death on the horrific sexual attack a week earlier at the hands of three teenage boys who then allegedly tried to cover up their involvement. On the night of the attack, a group of teenagers were at a friend's house drinking heavily. The girl who lived at the house threw the party when her parents left town. Three male classmates allegedly . helped an inebriated Audrie to a bedroom before stripping her naked, drawing over her . body and sexually assaulting her. Scroll down for video . Cruel: Pott, right, was aassaulted after a night of drinking  and boys spread photos of the attack . In police interviews, the teenagers admitted . to coloring half of her face black with marker, then . pulling down her bra, taking off her shorts and drawing on her breasts and near her genitals. They allegedly photographed themselves sexually assaulting her and, by the time she started her sophomore year at Saratoga High School two days later, scores of students had seen the images. Rolling Stone magazine has revealed the torment Audrie suffered in the days before her death and has detailed the messages she exchanged with her alleged attackers, whom she had known since middle school. She messaged one boy, vowing to kill him if he still had the images. 'They are deleted and I didn't take them,' he wrote. 'I promise it wasn't me.' Heartbroken: Lawrence Pott and Audrie's stepmother and his second wife Lisa have allegedly sent Facebook messages accepting that Lazarin is Audrie's biological fatehr . Grieving: Audrie's mother, Sheila Pott, found her daughter hanging in the bathroom in September 2012 . Audrie Pott wrote a series of desperate Facebook messages before her death that have been excerpted in Rolling Stone. In one exchange, she speaks to one of her alleged attackers: . AUDRIE: i need to talk to u. BOY: What . AUDRIE: one word... marker . BOY: What about marker . AUDRIE: u know what im talking about... i dont remeber anything about that... [A friend] had to tell me everything... i swear to god if u still have those pictures illl killl u . BOY: They are deleted and I didn't take them I promise it wasn't me... And I'm sorry about the marker . AUDRIE: You have no idea what it's like to be a girl . An exchange with another classmate: . CLASSMATE: lol that shit gets around haha everyone knows mostly everything hahaah . AUDRIE: oh my god... i f***ing hate people... Do you know how people view me now?... I now have a reputation I can never get rid of. AUDRIE: My life is over... I ruined my life and I don't even remember how. Source: Rolling Stone magazine . 'I'm sorry about the marker,' he added of the drawings that covered her body. She also messaged another boy who had been at the party to ask if one of the teenagers had photographs of her. 'ur fine,' he responded. 'ill make sure nothing goes around.' She replied: 'It's gonna get out. S*** always does. Especially with the people who were there.' And in an even more concerning exchange, one of her classmates sent her a message reading: 'lol that s*** gets around haha everyone knows mostly everything hahaah.' 'My life is over... I ruined my life and I don't even remember how,' one of her final messages read. 'You have no idea what it's like to be a girl.' When she returned to school, she missed classes to avoid people and had an argument with one of her closest friends, Kathy Atabakhsh, who accused her of becoming a different person. 'She had been, literally, the best person . you could meet – always honest and trustworthy,' Kathy told Rolling Stone. 'And I was so upset that she had . changed. It was hard for her to hear that from a close friend.' Another girl loudly pointed out in class that Audrie had been cutting herself, and the teenager burst out crying. She told friends she had cut herself on a vase. On September 12, 2012, Audrie had texted her mother, Sheila Pott, and pleaded for her to collect her from school - but was silent on the drive home. When they arrived back at the house, Audrie went to her bedroom and her mother went to check on her after about 20 minutes. She saw the bathroom door closed and knocked - to no answer. Desperate: Her parents have claimed that the school failed to help with bullying after they told staff . Becoming increasingly concerned, Mrs Pott frantically worked the lock from the outside and eventually opened the door. But it was too late - she saw her daughter hanging inside the room. She wracked her memory for what could have happened to her daughter. She said she remembered seeing marker on her daughter's chest - which the girl quickly dismissed - after the party, and that her daughter had called her unusually early the night after the party to come and collect her. After the death, Saratoga police agreed with the school to wait until a week later to start an investigation to allow the students time to grieve. But just days later, Audrie's friend Kathy went to talk to school administrators to explain what she knew about the party and the pictures of her friend. When police arrived to interview students, there had already been rumors of an investigation and some students were heard urging others to shut down their Facebook accounts, Rolling Stone reported. Left behind: Audrie is pictured left with her father, step mother and half brother and sisters . Remembered: Photographs show Audrie and her family and an essay she wrote about her happy home life . The Pott family learned of the police investigation when a relatives heard of it from a student and called Audrie's father to urge him not to cremate his daughter's body. When police investigated the three boys, they found that one boy had apparently lost his phone and another claimed his was broken. Due to these setbacks, it took seven months before the boys were charged. But on April 11, they were arrested on charges of misdemeanor sexual battery, felony possession of child pornography and felony sexual penetration. When they were seized, police allegedly found new images of naked teens on their phones and added charges. One boy was even trying to sell the pictures for money, the Rolling Stone reported. Two of the teenagers could receive community service or time in a juvenile detention center, and the third boy may be upgraded to an adult court, where he can expect to face a harsher punishment. Loved: School friends have remembered Audrie by wearing teal - her favorite color - to class . Scene: Saratoga High School, where the teens attended class. Two of the 'attackers' still go to the school . The Pott family has filed a civil suit against the boys and their families and an administrative claim against the school district, alleging that administrators did not respond to bullying against Audrie. The school has said these bullying claims were never discussed. Only one parent of the accused boys returned a call to Rolling Stone and said that the case had been misreported. He passed on their condolences to the Pott family. But he added: 'It was a prank by a few kids, and it's blown out of proportion. Audrie had a lot of other problems in her life, and everybody in Saratoga knows that.'","Audrie Pott, 15, hanged herself in September 2012 'after images were passed around school showing her naked and being sexually assaulted'

"Mexican artist Frida Kahlo's native garden and studio will be reimagined at the New York Botanical Garden in the spring. The garden will use flowers and plants native to Mexico in the exhibition 'Frida Kahlo: Art, Garden, Life,' which will open May 16 and run through November 1. The exhibition in New York City will reflect the bright colors and textures of Kahlo's portraits and still lifes. Famed for her colourful but disturbing self-portraits, that unabashed mono-brow, a turbulent marital relationship with fellow artist Diego Rivera and a raft of severe health problems, Kahlo, who was born in 1907, has fascinated art lovers for decades. The exhibit will feature about a dozen original paintings and drawings highlighting her use of botanical imagery. Photos of Kahlo and her husband, muralist Diego Rivera, also will be shown. The Enid A. Haupt Conservatory will be transformed into Kahlo's Blue House (Casa Azul) studio and garden outside Mexico City. It was decorated in traditional Mexican folk-art objects, Colonial-era art, native plants and religious ex-voto paintings that depict a tragedy or someone with a grave illness or injury. Among the features at the botanical garden will be a lava rock path lined with flowers. There also will be a scale version of a pyramid at Casa Azul that was created to display pre-Columbian art collected by her husband, muralist Diego Rivera. It will be filled with traditional Mexican terra cotta pots. The exhibition also will have a dozen of her original paintings and drawings on view at the nearby LuEsther T. Mertz Library's art gallery. The exhibition 'will provide an in-depth look at Kahlo's work and artistic environment and also celebrate the energy and sophistication of Mexican culture,' said Gregory Long, president and CEO of the garden. It will be curated by art historian and Mexican art specialist Adriana Zavala. The garden did a similar recreation in 2012 of Claude Monet's flower and water gardens and home at Giverny in the north of France. The same year an exhibition of her clothes, orthopaedic paraphernalia and even prosthetic limbs were displayed inside one of the Mexico City homes she shared with her husband. Mexican artist Frida Kahlo's native garden and studio will be reimagined at the New York Botanical Garden in the spring. This painting  (pictured) will join more than a dozen works by the artist at an exhibition at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx borough of New York . Smoke and Mirrors: Frida Kahlo's Dresses displays 300 accessories, corsets, clothes and health contraptions worn by Kahlo that have been locked away for over 50 years since her death in 1954, aged 47. The exhibit explored Kahlo's unique wardrobe which was chiefly inspired by Mexico's indigenous women who were famous for their richly embroidered frocks, flowery headpieces and ornate silver jewellery. But beneath her long dresses, Kahlo hid a body that had been contorted by childhood polio and then only just survived a horrific bus crash. Kahlo contracted polio when she was young, and the disease stunted the growth of her right leg. When she was 18, a metal tube pierced through her abdomen during a bus crash, subjecting her to painful operations and long periods of bed rest throughout her life. She had her right leg amputated in 1953, a year before her death.

"A grandmother from Kent has completed a gruelling 1,460 mile run across South Africa for charity. During the ultra run, Mimi Anderson, 52, had to pull on her trainers every morning for 32 consecutive days and run through challenging terrain. Her journey followed the Freedom Trail, an off-road route starting in Pietermaritzburg and finishing in Paarl, just outside Cape Town. Mimi was joined on the epic journey by Australian ultra runner Samantha Gash, 29, and their route took them over mountains, across rivers and through private game reserves full of wild animals including leopards, rhinos and wildebeests. Two generations united in one cause: Mimi Anderson, 52, left, and Samantha Gash, 29, ran 56 marathons back to back for charity . Epic journey on foot: Aided by a support crew including Steve Young, centre, the pair had to navigate their own route along the Freedom Trail in South Africa . Along with a support crew, the pair had to navigate their own way to complete the challenge that involved running a total of 56 marathons back-to-back. Speaking after completing the 32-day run, Mimi told MailOnline how difficult it had been thanks to the conditions. She said: 'There are sections along the route where tracks simply don't exist, so we would find ourselves going through thorn bushes, crawling in the undergrowth and at one point even walking down a river as it was easier than trying to trudge through seven feet high thick reeds. 'During the first week we climbed to the highest point along the route of 2,700m above sea level, the wind was so strong that we nearly got blown off our feet, but the views from the top were worth the long tough 8k climb up, it was like standing on top of the world. 'At one point we got to the top of a very high hill and it looked as though the only way down was to fly. Thankfully we discovered an extremely rocky, very steep decent down to the valley floor, in places we were on our bottoms in order to continue down.' She added: 'On the last day it took us six hours to do 10k, the terrain was nothing but rocks, very steep ascents and decents, climbing down waterfalls to get back down to the river, fighting our way through dense undergrowth and finishing with a very steep climb out of the valley, again at points having to use our hands for help.' Gruelling: The challenge involved scaling mountains and running on uneven terrain. Pictured with Mimi, centre, and Samantha, right, is another of their support crew, Callum Stowell, left . Mimi is no stranger to distance running having completed ultra races including the Marathon Des Sables, Badwater Ultra and Comrades Marathon (she did 'the double' at the latter two by turning around and running the route back as soon as she finished). She also holds the World Record for the fastest crossing of Ireland on foot and fastest time run by a female from Land's End to John O'Groats. But despite her many accomplishments, Mimi said her latest challenge was 'one of the hardest things she has ever done.' Speaking about why she wanted to do it, she said: 'Running an average of 80km per day for 32 days isn't something to be taken lightly and technical running isn't my forte. 'But I believe that in order to grow as a person we all need to do things that take us way out of our comfort zone, each time pushing just that little bit further – this project will push me further than I have ever pushed myself before, in many ways.' Super gran: Mimi has previously run the double Badwater in soaring temperatures in America's Death Valley among her other achievements . Pushing limits of endurance: Mimi, pictured taking part in the Badwater Ultra, said the 1,460 mile run across South Africa was her toughest challenge yet . Mimi and Samantha put themselves though the long-distance run with the support of NGO Save The Children Australia in order to raise money for girls and women in South Africa. So far they have raised 40,494 Australian dollars (£22,000). 'Both of us felt that if we were to take on a challenge as big as this we wanted to raise money to help South African girls and women. Samantha is 29 and I'm 52, two women, two generations and two pairs of legs supporting others,' Mimi said. They are aiming to raise awareness and funds to set up of a social enterprise business in the Free State of South Africa that will employ a dozen South African women to make re-usable sanitary pads in order to keep girls in education. The pair were shocked at how many girls are missing out on school because of a lack of adequate sanitary products. Mimi explained: 'Once they reach puberty, one in three South African girls miss out on four or five days of school per month because they cannot afford to buy sanitary pads. Instead they stay at home and use anything from old rags and rolled up newspapers - anything they can get their hands on. Eventually they drop out of school altogether.' The grandmother-of-three said thinking of the charity kept her pushing on when the going got tough during the run. Despite the gruelling nature of the event, she was delighted to finish without sustaining any injuries. She said: 'Luckily for me I had no real issues apart from a small blister on my left foot, my 52 year old body held up really well!'

"Britain's most famous locomotive is celebrating its 80th anniversary since becoming the first ever train to travel at over 100mph. A stunning set of pictures of the Flying Scotsman have now been released to mark its world record breaking journey on November 30,  1934, as it travelled between Edinburgh and London. The London North and Eastern Railway, LNER, locomotive's speed hit triple digits on the downwards slope of Stoke Bank near Grantham, when it officially became the fastest train in the world. Scroll down for video . On November 30, the 1934, the LNER locomotive hit the magic 100pmh speed on the downwards slope of Stoke Bank near Grantham (pictured) becoming the world's fastest train . Driver William Sparshatt, aged 61 at the time, on the day the landmark journey took place as he guided the train between London and Leeds . Photographs show the A3 Gresley Pacific, a class of locomotive built by LNER, in all its glory and feature driver William Sparshatt, aged 61 at the time, on the day the landmark journey took place as he guided the train between London and Edinburgh. Sir Nigel Gresley had designed the steam train after the LNER asked him to help them find a new way to take passengers from the capital to Newcastle in four hours instead of buying a German diesel-powered 'Flying Hamburger'. Built in Doncaster in 1923, the locomotive was named the 'Flying Scotsman' after the London to Edinburgh rail service which had been running since 1862, and was the first train to complete the 392-mile route non-stop on May 1, 1928. Built in Doncaster in 1923, the locomotive was named the 'Flying Scotsman' after the London to Edinburgh rail service which had been running since 1862 . The locomotive was the first train to reach 100mph and also the first to complete the 392-mile London to Edinburgh route non-stop on May 1, 1928 . Arguably the world's most famous train, the Flying Scotsman has been restored and studied extensively, as can be seen here where scientific research is carried out onboard in 1931 . Since then it has had various owners including record producer Pete Waterman, and has toured the United States and Australia where it set its second world record, for the longest non-stop run by a steam locomotive. The Flying Scotsman made a special charter journey in 2005 also captured in the pictures before being moved to the National Railway Museum in York for complete restoration. Paul Kirkman, Director of the National Railway Museum, said: 'We are now progressing full steam ahead towards completing the restoration. 'We are showcasing British engineering genius, with our Mallard 75 Great Goodbye celebration at Locomotion; the National Railway Museum at Shildon next month so it's great that we can announce good news regarding another Gresley-designed icon. It served for 39 years before being decommissioned from scheduled service in 1963 after it had clocked up more than two million miles. The National Railway Museum have released the incredible collection of photographs to mark 80 years since its record breaking journey . In a daring feat, a plane flies perilously close as plane passengers talk to railway passengers on the Flying Scotsman, while both travel 90mph in March 1932 . The locomotive, pictured here in 2005, has changed hands on a number of occasions since being decommissioned by British Railways, including record producer Pete Waterman . The flagship locomotive had its first taste of fame at the British Empire Exhibition in 1924 before it was selected for the prestigious London to Edinburgh service. When British Railways decided to scrap the train in in 1963, a campaign group called 'Save Our Scotsman' attempted to raise the money to buy the Flying Scotsman. The group failed and it was instead bought by railway preservationist Alan Pegler who restored it to 1930s condition, before he famously took it on a tour of the United States, supported by Prime Minister Harold Wilson, for which it was fitted with a bell, headlamp and cowcatcher. When Pegler was hit by financial issues, British businessman William McAlpine bought the Flying Scotsman and toured Australia between 1988-9 it, where the train broke its second world record, for the longest ever non-stop run by a steam locomotive,  when it ran 422 miles (679 km) on 8 August 1989. The locomotive was to change hands several times again but in 2004, following a successful campaign, Flying Scotsman was returned to public ownership when it was purchased by the National Railways Museum. As part of ongoing restorations, it was moved to Bury last year and engineers working on the locomotive hope it will be ready for action on modern British train tracks in summer 2015.

"We all get a bit grumpy on an empty stomach - but there's no need to get angry and violent about it. But try telling that to these two herons, who were literally at each other's throats after fighting over a fish. The pair were fishing for their supper in the Camargue area of southern France and it seems that one may have snatched the tasty catch right out of the other's mouth. And as these pictures, by Italian photographer Pino Magliani show, his friend didn't take to kindly to it. That was mine! This hungry heron gets ready to give its friend a few choice words and well-aimed pecks after missing out on a tasty fish supper . Angry birds: Squaring up eye-to-eye and beak-to-beak, the heron lets rip at the fish thief . Flying feathers: A third heron nearby (bottom left) looks on in astonishment as the other two start fighting . Magliani, 45, was delighted to capture the hilarious exchange. He said: 'I spent a couple of hours photographing the herons, and these two had been standing together looking for fish for a long time. 'They were obviously getting very hungry, and probably a bit grumpy. Suddenly, another heron in the group caught a fish, and there was a squabble for it. 'One of the herons didn't end up getting any of the fish, and was obviously a bit put out. 'The flock got really angry and quite aggressive, and they stood in silence for a while. 'Then, one of them suddenly approached the other, and went right up into his face. 'It made me chuckle because he looked so angry - and his friend was taken completely by surprise. Back off! The heron looks quite horrified that his friend should take losing a fish so personally . And another thing! The pictures were taken by photographer Pino Magliani in the Camargue area of southern France . Calm down! The attacker finally backs off, as the other heron looks on haughtily . 'I love photographing the birds, but they are very shy creatures. 'I have to use a hide when I'm taking pictures. I use a very light hide that is similar to a poncho - it covers just me and the tripod with the camera. It is very portable and light. 'There are so many birds and they're all different.

"Hot Stuff singer Donna Summer died this morning aged 63 after a battle with cancer, her family has confirmed. The Boston-born star, known as the Queen of Disco, passed away in Florida. The Seventies icon was battling lung cancer, TMZ is reporting, with sources telling the website Donna believed she contracted the illness by inhaling toxic particles after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York. Her family released a statement, saying Summer died on Thursday morning and that they 'are at peace celebrating her extraordinary life and her continued legacy'. Scroll to see video of iconic songs and one of Donna's last performances... Queen of Disco: Donna Summer, pictured in 1979, has passed away aged 63 . It went on: 'Words truly can't express how much we appreciate your prayers and love for our family at this sensitive time.' She had been living in Englewood, Florida, with her husband Bruce Sudano. The singer will be remembered at a public memorial in Nashville, Tennessee next Wednesday. Sources told TMZ she had attempted to keep the extent of her illness from fans and was recently trying to finish up her latest album. According to Entertainment Tonight, she was diagnosed with cancer 10 months ago and only told her husband and three children. Secret battle: This is the last picture taken of Summer in public, pictured in October last year just seven months before her death performing in Las Vegas . Hit maker: Summer is know for her popular 70s tracks including Hot Stuff and Bad Girls . ET also reports she will be laid to rest in Nashville on Monday following her funeral. Summers, real name LaDonna Gaines, is best know for her string of 70s hits, including I Feel Love, Last Dance and Bad Girls. She was a five-time Grammy Award winner and the first artist to have three consecutive double albums reach number one on the US Billboard chart. Diva: Summer seen on stage during performances from her heyday in the Seventies . Seventies crew: Donna takes the stage with Tom Jones, left, and Dolly Parton in 1977 on the Mac Davis: Sounds Like Home  show . She was also the first female artist with four No. 1 singles in a 13-month period, according to the Rock Hall of Fame, where she was a nominee this year. Dionne Warwick: 'My heart goes out to her husband and her children. Prayers will be said to keep them strong.' Billy Ray Cyrus: ""R I P #Donna Summer LEGEND!!! Your music will live forever.' Gloria Estefan: 'Few singers have impacted music & the world like Donna Summer! It's the end of an era... Peace & prayers 2 all who loved her. I will miss her!' La Toya Jackson: 'My condolence to #Donna Summer's family & love ones. She will be terribly missed. She was truly the #Disco Queen!' Timbaland (music producer): 'This cant be tru. i cant believe this RIP Donna Summer. at a lost 4words.' Russell Simmons: 'RIP Donna Summer' Ellen DeGeneres: 'I'm so sad about the news that Donna Summer died this morning. I was a big fan. I even used one of her songs in my show that airs today.' Quincy Jones: 'Rest in Peace dead Donna Summer. Your voice was the heartbeat and soundtrack of a decade.' Ricky Martin: 'RIP Donna Summer :0(' Summer came to prominence just as disco was burgeoning, and came to define the era with a string of No. 1 hits and her beauty queen looks. Disco became as much defined by her sultry, sexual vocals - her bedroom moans and sighs - as the relentless, pulsing rhythms of the music itself. Summers married actor Helmuth Sommer in 1973 before giving birth to the couple's daughter Mimi later that year. Although the marriage crumbled in 1975, she kept an altered version of her ex's surname to use as her stage name. She married Brooklyn Dreams musician Bruce Sudano in 1980 and the couple went on to have two daughters, Brooklyn, born in 1981 and Amanda the following year. In 1994, the family moved from Los Angeles to Nashville where Donna took time out from showbusiness to focus on painting but had recently returned to the recording studio. As well has staggering career highs, Summer also endured personal lows. She suffered serious depression in the wake of September 11 terrorist attacks in New York. 'I was really freaked out by the horrific experiences of that day,' Summer, who was at her Manhattan apartment during the 2001 attacks, once said. 'I couldn't go out, I didn't want to talk to anybody. I had to keep the blinds down and stay in my bedroom.' Friends eventually intervened and the born-again Christian also found strength in her faith. Paying their respects: Fans lays flowers on Donna Summer's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame . Remembered: Candles and a record by the late singer surround her star . 'I went to church, and light came back into my soul,' she said in 2008. 'That heaviness was gone.' Love to Love You Baby, with its erotic moans, was her first hit and one of the most scandalous songs of the polyester-and-platform-heel era. Unlike some other stars of disco who faded as the music became less popular, Summer was able to grow beyond it and later segued to a pop-rock sound. Family: Summer with her husband Bruce Sudano and their daughter Brooklyn in 2003. The couple also had another daughter together, Amanda. She had a daughter, Mimi, from a previous marriage . Legacy: Brooklyn with sister Amanda Sudanao in 2010 and, right, Donna in the early 70s with her then-husband Helmut Sommer, from whom she took a version of her later name Summer, and their daughter Mimi . She had one of her biggest hits in the 1980s with She Works Hard For The Money, which became another anthem, this time for women's rights. Dancing Queen: Shaking some moves at the famous Studio 54 nightclub in New York in the Seventies . Soon after, Summer became a born-again Christian and faced controversy when she was accused of making anti-gay comments in relation to the AIDS epidemic. Summer denied making the comments, but was the target of a boycott. Still, even as disco went out of fashion she remained a fixture in dance clubs, endlessly sampled and remixed into contemporary dance hits. Summer, real name LaDonna Adrian Gaines, was born in 1948 in Boston. She was raised on gospel music and became the soloist in her church choir by age 10. Love to Love You Baby was her U.S. chart debut and the first of 19 No. 1 dance hits between 1975 and 2008 - second only to Madonna. During the disco era she burned up the charts: She was the only artist to have three consecutive double-LPs hit No. 1, Live and More, `Bad Girls and On the Radio. She was never comfortable with the 'Disco Queen' label. Musically, she began to change in 1979 with Hot Stuff, which had a tough, rock `n' roll beat. Her diverse sound helped her earn Grammy Awards in the dance, rock, R&B and inspirational categories. Dionne Warwick said in a statement that she was sad to lose a great performer and 'dear friend'. 'My heart goes out to her husband and her children,' Warwick said. 'Prayers will be said to keep them strong.' Summer released her last album, Crayons, in 2008. It was her first full studio album in 17 years. She also performed on American Idol that year with its top female contestants. Accolade: Posing in 1979 with the three awards she bagged at the Amerian Music Awards in Los Angeles and, right, performing later that year at the Universal Amphitheatre, also in LA .

"Sony announced on Friday that it will miss its stock market deadline for publishing its third-quarter earnings as a result of the Sony hack. The company will still brief analysts on February 4, as previously scheduled, but will only be able to provide estimated information from its movie division Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. The Wall Street Journal reports that the financial and electronics division will be finalized numbers but because of the scandal affecting the movie division it will not be able to provide those same amounts. Stocks table: This is an image of Sony's year to year stock table but the company is delaying the release of its final quarterly earning due to the destructive cyber-attack . 'The third-quarter figures for Sony as a whole won’t be final, because the movie segment can’t report them by the original deadline,' a Sony spokesman said. The movie company said that it would need to submit all final company earnings on March 31 when the original final deadline was February 16. Bloomberg reports that when the FBI told Sony that North Korea was behind the attack, they took their entire network offline including accounting and finances. The hack: North Korea is thought to have been behind the Sony Hack in response to the movie The Interview . The hack was in response to Sony's comedy about North Korea called, 'The Interview' starring Seth Rogan and James Franco. As a result of that hack, financial and accounting applications at Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. are not expected to be functional until early next month. The cost related to the hack may cost as much as $169 million Amir Anvarzadeh, a manager of Japanese equity sales at BGC Partners Inc. in Singapore, said. Anvarzadeh recommends buying shares of Sony. Sony Chief Executive Officer Kazuo Hirai  said that financial damage to Sony from the hacking campaign would likely be limited. In a statement on Friday he said the impact would be 'light.'

"It looks like a giant tornado is causing mayhem in the sky - but this image is simply the reflection of a river running through a mine. To create this spectacular moment, photographer Tomas Bogonez went to the Rio Tinto's mining zone along the Rio Tinto river in Huelva, Spain. A site along the river has been used for mining for centuries and that is why the colours in the photographs are so bright and vivid. Twisted weather: Although the image appears to show a flame-red twister, it is actually the deep red hue of Spain's Rio Tinto river . Firestorm: Centuries of mining have created the incredibly rich colours in the water . Other images of the bright red river bed show what appears to be a sky cracked with fiery lightning and orange-hued clouds. It was mined for copper, silver and gold, and now the water is very acidic - resulting in a deep reddish hue because of the dissolved iron. Tomas, from Guadalajara in Spain, admits this wasn't the first time he visited the special place. The 59-year-old said: 'I have been to this beautiful place several times to take photographs, but this is my most memorable set of pictures. Electric: This vibrant image looks like an ethereal flame-coloured lightning storm, complete with clouds . Heat: This is not lava, pouring out from a fissure beneath the sea, but a vein of dissolved iron ore beneath a river . 'The photographs show the bright colours of the bed - I have never seen it so vibrant before. 'The texture of the river was mind-blowing, the bright colours and the reflection of the river was amazing to see."" He added: 'The colour of the river depends on the time, hour of the day, month of the year and even the level of water. River of time: The area has been mined for more than 5,000 years by a variety of different civilizations . 'If the level of water is high, the bottom is not seen and therefore the colour is dimmer and the photographs aren't great.' The area around the Rio Tinto has been mined since ancient times. In approximately 3,000 BCE, Iberians and Tartessians began mining the site, followed by the Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Visigoths, and Moors. After a period of abandonment, the mines were rediscovered in 1556 and the Spanish government began operating them once again in 1724.

"The last thing you would see  in final terrifying moments before the crocodile's jaw snaps shut are its deadly teeth followed by darkness. Crocodiles strike fear in a way not many other animals can, infamous for their ferocious ambush tactics, deadly speed and moves including the death roll. A 50-second video of a five-metre saltwater crocodile named Elvis taken at the Australian Reptile Park north of Sydney is all it takes to prove how vicious the aquatic reptile can be. Filmed on a GoPro during feeding time, three men can be seen inside the 48-year old crocodile's enclosure, with the camera stategically placed to capture everything. Scroll down to see the crocodile in action . Help! The angry crocodile's sharp teeth can been seen as it clenches on to a GoPro camera . One man approaches the water area where the crocodile, the longest in NSW, is submerged. After disturbing the animal by using a stick to splash the water in its purpose-built lagoon, the angered animal lunges out head first towards the man. The same man then dangles a stick with a piece of meat attached to it above the crocodile's head. After two attempts the crocodile gets the piece of meet and easily gulps it down. But the reptile is not finished there - it then turns its attention to the nearby camera, which it violently attacks, moving with speed and ease as it clenches the camera in its jaws. The camera remains in the crocodile's mouth for about seven seconds, before the massive animal tosses it across the enclosure, sending it airborne and crashing into water. While inside the reptile's mouth, several sharp teeth and its white tongue can been seen as the camera faces directly into its jaws. Australian Reptile Park general manager Tim Faulkner was in the enclosure at the time and said while there was always an element of risk when working with crocodiles, the handlers were methodical in their approach. Fearless: Two men can be seen in the background as they watch on as the crocodile attacks the camera . Lunch: As saltwater crocodiles grow, their prey gets bigger, with adult male able to take prey as big as a one-tonne water buffalo . 'If you make a mistake he's (Elvis) going to have you . . . It's always a calculated risk,' he said. 'Crocodiles are not known for being intelligent, but what they lack they make up for in instinct. 'We were filming for archival footage but he (Elvis) must have sensed something different - he was curious.' Despite the animals attack on the camera, Mr Faulkner said he was not in danger and found the incident comical to watch. 'As big as they are they are still inquisitive,' he said. But this footage is not the first time Elvis' bad behaviour was caught on camera. The angry crocodile is renown for his aggressive nature, having previously attacked a lawn mower while in use at the reptile park in 2011 (see video below). He was relocated to the park from Darwin Harbour for being a rouge crocodile with a history of climbing on board fishing boats. Dangerous: Elvis (pictured) is renown for his aggressive nature and was relocated to the park from Darwin Harbour for climbing on board fishing boats . The camera remains in the crocodile's mouth for a few seconds, before it is fired across the enclosure into the lagoon . He was them moved to farm but was deemed not suitable after attacking other crocodiles. In 2008 he moved into the park. The saltwater crocodile is the world's largest reptile and can be found on Australia's northern coast and inland for more than 100 kilometres. They can also be found in south east Asia and eastern coast of India. Growing to an average length of about four metres, they can exceed this, growing up to seven metres long and with a lifespan of about 70 years. As the animals grow their prey also gets bigger, with adult male saltwater crocodiles able to demolish prey as big as a one-tonne water buffalo. However, their diet is mostly made up of small prey including fish, turtles, small mammals and birds. The crocodiles prefer living in deep and dark murky waters and they favour estuary areas.","A 50-second video shows five-metre saltwater crocodile attack a camera .

"A six-year-old girl has launched a petition to clear Times Square of characters that charge New Yorkers for cuddles. According to Kamila Filshtinskiy: 'Hugs should not cost money!'. To combat the crisis, she plans to raise funds to buy costumes so she and her friends can swarm the tourist hot spot hugging people for free. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Hugs should NOT cost money!' Kamily Filshtinskiy, six, wants to give New Yorkers cuddles for free . Change: The Brooklyn-based schoolgirl wants a change of attitude in Times Square this Christmas . Her mission comes after numerous failed bids by the local government and police force to crack down on reported cases of aggression in the tourist hot spot. On the crowdfunding site Indiegogo, the Brooklyn-based elementary school pupil writes: 'When children see Elmo, Minnie and Princesses, they want to hug them, tell them that they love 'em, and take pictures with them. 'But they (characters) tell parents to give them a lot of money, and if children or their parents don't, they (Elmo & others) become mean and don't want to take pictures. 'It makes me sad, and it makes other children sad. Princesses and superheroes should not make children feel sad!' She said she wants a change of attitude in Midtown by Christmas. Her father Mikhail told the New York Post she said: 'Daddy can you please change the world? Can you make it so Elmo doesn't charge kids to take pictures with him?' Since November 22, she has raised more than $330. Raising money: Kamila's campaign aims to raise money for costumes so she can replace the current Elmos . 'Makes children sad': She said panhandlers harassing parents for money makes their children upset . Gaining momentum: Since November 22, the elementary school pupil has raised more than $330 . The bid comes amid an ongoing crackdown dubbed Operation Sesame Street targeting costumed panhandlers. In September, an Elmo character looking for tourists to pose for pictures with in Times Square  ended up in handcuffs. Rosa Sanchez, 36, from Clifton, New Jersey, was taken into custody for allegedly demanding tips in an aggressive manner from passersby while dressed in an Elmo costume. Arresting officers who were part of an undercover sting operation restrained the woman's hands behind her back and took a picture of her fuzzy red costume with the caption: 'Iust another day in Midtown south. Elmo arrested in Times Square.' Sesame Street bust: Rosa Sanchez, 36, pictured here dressed as Elmo, was arrested in Midtown Manhattan Tuesday for aggressive panhandling . Ms Sanchez was then taken to Midtown South Police Precinct to be charged for aggressive solicitation. The New York Post reported that the 36-year-old was arrested after 10 police officers posing as tourists took pictures with her. Sanchez allegedly became irate when one of the plainclothes cops gave her a small tip. Most famously, a man named Daniel Sandler was arrested in 2012 for spewing anti-Semitic slurs while dressed as Elmo in Midtown Manhattan. As recently as July, a man dressed as Spider-Man was charged with punching a police officer who intervened in a tipping dispute with a tourist.

Last month, police spent hours handing out bright red fliers in Times Square warning tourists that photos with costumed characters are free, and tipping is optional. Some of the mostly Spanish-speaking immigrants who wear the giant costumes lamented that the police crackdown has left them with far less to feed their families.

"The hope or fear, depending on one's outlook, that Red Bull are imploding just as Ferrari did to some degree at the close of the Michael Schumacher era seem far-fetched. Ferrari lost all their star men in quick succession: Jean Todt, the team principal, Ross Brawn, the technical director, Rory Byrne, the chief designer, and Schumacher himself. The Germanic, English and, to an extent, French pragmatism vanished. The dangers inherent in this were summed up colourfully by Niki Lauda when he said: 'The English were the bridge between the Germans, with their rigid, inflexible style, and the Italians, who only understand spaghetti and romance.' Second fiddle: Red Bull have won the last four drivers' and constructors' titles but have fallen behind Mercedes . Red Bull are not in Ferrari's position despite the news that Adrian Newey, the star designer of his age, is taking on extra responsibilities with Red Bull Technology projects and will have only 'a small say' in next year's car and act as an adviser thereafter. Although Newey has been granted the new challenges he sought to revitalise himself at 55, he will remain on hand. 'Adrian can switch the dial up when he wants,' said Christian Horner, Red Bull's team principal. For now at least, Sebastian Vettel, their outstanding driver, is staying (though the rumour mill continues to link him with Ferrari). Horner, the shrewd architect of eight championships in four years, also remains. His skills as a tap dancer were again to the fore in the latest Newey deal: with Ferrari sniffing around, he gave his leading technician what he wanted, thereby ensuring that even if Red Bull were not going to get Newey's undivided attention, nor was anyone else in the paddock. The broadening of Red Bull's involvement also handily answers the accusation that they are nothing more than a drinks company, an advertisement for a brand of liquid sugar and caffeine. They are putting down roots in the engineering world. The exact nature of their plans for Red Bull Technology will only be revealed later this year, but Newey's involvement in America's Cup yachting is something that he and Sir Ben Ainslie, the country's finest sailor, both welcome. This season's Mercedes dominance shows that sport is partly cyclical. But this shift of power, and Newey's redefined role, need not betoken a permanent end to Red Bull as we know them. On track: Mercedes won the opening six races before Daniel Ricciardo's win for Red Bull at the Canadian GP . 'Cybernats' was not a word I had heard before reading the coverage of JK Rowling's £1million donation to help save the United Kingdom from Scottish independence. These 'cybernats' – the supporters of nationalism who direct abuse online at those who question their cause – made menacing threats against the author for daring to hold a view different from theirs. The Mail deemed some of the Twitter vitriol to be unprintable in a family newspaper. But we did record how one intellectual contributor to the debate boasted that he would 'do time for this'. Another constitutional expert vouchsafed the following: 'JK Rowling can f*** off! Money should have been donated to FoodBanks!! #VoteYes' Under attack: Threats were made towards JK Rowling after her £1m donation to help save the UK from Scottish independence . This is not the place to discuss the merits of keeping the UK together, but the episode provides a parallel with how issues in modern sport are discussed online. I make a point of not reading comments below stories I write, so not to be swayed by the positive or negative responses, and trust they are all sweetness and light, rhyme and reason. But I have heard of a death threat – however serious the intent – being issued to at least one colleague. Readers viciously insult each other, too. Reason is trampled over. This coarsening of sporting discourse, often along tribal lines, especially in football, is a disease. Formula One is not immune. Here is an exchange I found within seconds of looking on the F1 pages of another newspaper website. Jake Harods, challenged about his achievements in life, left this comment: 'I am not telling you nothing:) I suspect better than yours.....and my gf is prettier than your wife ....and Lewis is still faster than Jenslow :).' Someone who exquisitely calls himself Adolf Galland weighed in with his pearls: 'You are truly pathetic. Even a brainless, spineless, ignorant 10 year old troll could come up better comments than you.' Such epigrams. Perhaps we should remind the trolls that sport is all about opinions, which should be given and taken with a degree of proportion. It is not a matter of life and death (threats). Raring to go: McLaren posted this picture of 1976 World Champion James Hunt earlier this week . In black and white: Hunt playing squash . An addendum to the suggestive picture McLaren issued this week of James Hunt in training. His second favourite means of keeping fit was playing squash. He would frequently arrive late for a fixture at his club, the Royal Automobile. 'Often I would be in the changing room fretting until I heard the clip, clip, clip of his shoes as he came down the staircase,' recalled John Hopkins, a journalist and fellow RAC member. 'The next moment he would burst in full of apologies. ""Some silly sod tried to carve me up going round Clapham Common. I had to sort him out. I took him on the next bend. He didn't know whether he was coming or going. Served him right.""' Hopkins, who wrote A Celebration of 100 Years of Squash at Pall Mall, added: 'His technique was individual, based on fast darting steps around the court accompanied by the odd expletive. With his hair flying he chased every shot, ricocheting off the side walls, gasping for breath. Living his squash to the full as he did his life. 'He was not stylish but that did not matter because he never knew when he was beaten. An added bonus was that over dinner he would recount tales of fast cars and beautiful women. Or was it the other way round?' Hunt died 21 years ago this weekend. Reports: There were some suggestions in the Italian media that Lewis Hamilton visited Maranello this week . The most curious story of the week was a report in the Italian press that Lewis Hamilton secretly visited Ferrari's factory in Maranello. So far as I can tell, it was erroneous. His management insist he was still in Canada at the time. But I can reveal that Hamilton has been a regular customer of Ferrari, going back to his McLaren days. He likes their road cars, not unreasonably. Congratulations to Daniel Ricciardo on winning the Canadian Grand Prix. He was a popular victor. But how does his form impact on the reputation of Sebastian Vettel, the four-time world champion? I suggest we wait a little longer before re-opening the debate over whether the German has been flattered by his cars and is really little better than average. Winner: Australian Daniel Ricciardo celebrated his first grand prix victory at the last race in Montreal . He drove brilliantly for long periods of his championship-winning seasons and those achievements dwarf a mere seven poor-to-mediocre races. One further thought if were to downgrade Vettel, where would it leave his team-mate of those four years, Mark Webber? The FIA this week announced it has signed the Brighton Declaration on Women and Sport, committing itself to 'increase the involvement of women in sport at all levels and in all functions and roles'. Laudable, but I've yet to hear a response from the Grid Girls Union.","Ferrari lost all their star men in quick succession; Michael Schumacher, Jean Todt and Ross Brawn .

"With its walls left to crumble, and ivy winding its way through grandiose halls and staircases, it's easy to imagine how Overstone Hall might have fallen into disrepair because of a lack of funds for its upkeep. However, the Northamptonshire stately home's troubles run far deeper than that. Right from its first owner - Lord Overstone - it has been a resolutely unloved place and, since a fire ravaged the upper floors a decade ago, it has been up for sale for a mere £1million but without any interest. Scroll down for video . Overstone Hall in Northamptonshire was hated by Lord Overstone whose wife commissioned the vast property in 1860 and has never been wanted by any of its owners . The stately home boasts  114 rooms, occupying 20,000sq ft and sits on 50 acres of country parkland in Overstone, Northamptonshire . The 19th century stately home boasts 114 rooms in 50 acres of  country parkland in Overstone, Northamptonshire. Lady Overstone commissioned the  Elizabethan and Renaissance  style building in 1860, but didn't live to see it finished. Unfortunately her husband Lord Overstone hated the design, built by architect William Milford Teulon, and even declared his contempt in a letter to friends. 'The new house, I regret to say, is a cause of unmitigated and disappointment and vexation,' wrote Lord Overstone. 'It is an utter failure, although very large and full of pretension - it has neither taste, comfort nor convenience. I am utterly ashamed of it.' Lord Overstone despised it so much that he refused to live in it for the remainder of his life, leaving it to his daughter Lady Wantage on his death in 1883. The lounge inside Overstone Hall in the 1920s when it was owned by Sir Philip Stott who used it as a training base for Conservative party members . Sir Philip Stott who wanted to turn it into a training base for the Conservative Party disliked the imposing building and condemned his scheme as an 'abject failure' in 1928, before it was sold to the Charlotte Mason Schools Company . Lord Overstone (left) declared that he did not like the mansion his wife had designed and gave it to his daughter Lady Wantage (right) on his death in 1883 . Lady Overstone commissioned the Victorian hodgepodge of Elizabethan and Renaissance architectural style in 1860, but didn't live to see it finished . The mansion has now fallen into disrepair and has been reclaimed by nature with ivy and foliage growing through all the rooms in the house . A fire ripped through the top floor destroying 60 per cent of the property in April 2001, including all of the principal rooms and the impressive carved staircase . Lady Wantage also spent minimal time at the property, only occasionally using it for winter hunting parties, so it was sold in 1920 . In 1979 the school closed and was sold privately for £701,000 and used by the New Testament Church of God as its UK headquarters . Lady Wantage also spent minimal time at the property, only occasionally using it for winter hunting parties. After she died in 1920, the property was sold to Sir Philip Stott who intended to use it as a training base for Conservative party members. However he condemned the scheme as an 'abject failure' in 1928. It was privately sold to Charlotte Mason Schools Company in 1929 where part of the massive building was run as a girls' boarding school. Lord Overstone hated the house so much that he refused to live there, saying: 'It is a cause of unmitigated and disappointment and vexation' The property was listed in 2010 for £1million but the property didn't sell and is still owned by the New Testament Church of God, which is asking for the same price . Lord Overstone's daughter, Harriet, inherited the house after his death . Overstone Park was acquired by Lewis Loyd, father of Samuel Jones-Loyd, 1st Baron Overstone, for £117,500 in 1832. On the death of Lewis Loyd in 1858, the house and 10,000 acres of land became Lord Overstone’s property. The banker and politician had married Harriet, daughter of Conservative politician Ichabod Wright, in 1829. Together they had one son, who died as an infant, and a daughter The Honourable Harriet Sarah Jones Loyd in 1829. In 1860 Lady Overstone decided to engage the architect William Milford Teulon to replace the existing house with something more in keeping with their taste. She was keen to have a property fitting with their status and so her husband decided to rebuild on a grand scale. But she commissioned a design with a mixture of Elizabethan and Renaissance features which led to one of the most derided houses created in the Victorian era. Lady Overstone died before the house was completed in November 1864 and left her husband a widower. He hated the house and remarked in a letter to a friend: 'The New House, I regret to say, is a cause of unmitigated disappointment and vexation. It is an utter failure although very large and full of pretension, it has neither taste, comfort, nor convenience.' He refused to live there in his later years and left the house and extensive fortune to his daughter Harriet on his death in 1883, . One of the most revered heiresses of her time, she was a noted philanthropist, and greatly interested in hospital and nursing work. In November 1858 she married Robert James Lindsay, who assumed the name of Loyd-Lindsay by deed poll. Early on, they became the owners of two fine country places - Overstone Park, Northampton, and Lockinge House, Wantage, where the couple chiefly resided. She only used the Overstone estate occasionally for winter hunting parties, as her main home was in Oxfordshire. With her husband, a former distinguished soldier and Victoria Cross hero, she was instrumental in establishing the National Aid Society, which was really the forerunner of the British Red Cross Society. Photographer Mathew Growcoot, 25, who entered the property described his experience as surreal and haunting, saying it has been reclaimed by nature . Lord Overstone despised the house so much that he refused to live in it for the remainder of his life, leaving it to his daughter Lady Wantage on his death in 1883 . In 1979 the school closed and was sold privately for £701,000 and used by the New Testament Church of God as its UK headquarters. A fire ripped through the top floor in April 2001, destroying 60 per cent of the property including all of the principal rooms and the impressive carved staircase. Photographer Mathew Growcoot, 25, who entered the property described his experience as surreal and haunting. He said: 'I've never been to anywhere like it, it is such an enormous, imposing house that has been reclaimed by nature. 'I can understand why it was never wanted by any of its owners, the main tower looks distinctly unfriendly. It's hard to judge the interior because there's so little of it left but the few rooms that did remain were far too big and drafty. 'It was totally surreal being there and I did feel on edge because of the constants noises and flutterings, I actually had to remind myself that I don't believe in ghosts.' The property was listed in 2010 for £1million but the property didn't sell and is still owned by the New Testament Church of God. A buyer is presently being sought. It was privately sold to Charlotte Mason Schools Company in 1929 where part of the massive building was ran as a girls' boarding school . The property is still owned by the New Testament Church of God and the organisation is hoping it will sell for more than £1million . Ivy and creepers have started growing through the windows and up the walls of the stately home in Northamptonshire since the fire in 2001 .","Overstone Hall in Northamptonshire has been reclaimed by nature after a devastating fire in 2001 .

"At least one person saw the mortally wounded Eastern Michigan University football player Demarius Reed lying in an apartment building stairwell last Friday but thought he'd just passed out from a party and didn’t call for help. Interim Ypsilanti Police Chief Tony DeGiusti also announced Tuesday that at least six people heard gunshots in the moments before the player and others saw a fight in a parking lot. Those six didn’t call police either. Shocking: After 20-year-old Demarius Reed was murdered in his apartment complex hallway, at least one person walked by his body and ignored it, believing he was passed out drunk . Senseless: Demarius Reed was a promising wide receiver who hoped to make it to the NFL after he finished his degree, which was just two years away . Police say it wasn't until Reed's roommate happened upon the body that the death was reported, around 7:15am. Police have released these new details after a resident of a building near where Reed was murdered reported being pistol whipped by an attacker who knocked on his door a few days after Reed’s death. There have a total of four attacks near campus in recent days, including two sexual assaults. ‘This has been an extremely bizarre and unusual series of events these past few days with senseless, random acts of violence,’ said university President Sue Martin. Epidemic? Eastern Michigan University Police Chief Bob Hayes speaks with students and community members during a safety forum Tuesday. Police released the new information after it came to light that another man was attacked days after Reed . Why? Ypsilanti's Interim Police Chief Tony DeGiust, center, also said that 6 people heard gunshots the night of Reed's murder but, like the student who passed by his body, did not call police . Tragic: The former Chicago high school football star was studying communications . Police are offering $5,000 for clues to the killer's identity and say they're looking for anyone who attended a party at the off-campus University Green apartments where he was found dead. The 20-year-old communications junior major from Chicago was shot multiple times Friday in what police say may have been a robbery. So far, about 30 people have been interviewed by police, multiple pieces of evidence have been collected and several homes have been searched, MLive.com reported. 'Police can’t be everywhere,' Eastern Michigan Police Chief Robert Heighes told the forum. 'It’s a collaborative effort. We need the support of our community.' The authorities say the investigation is bearing fruit. ‘We are actively working some solid leads,’ DeGiusti said. ‘We are diligently working on this case.’ Teammates plan to attend Reed's funeral Saturday in Harvey, Ill. A visitation is scheduled for Friday. A moment of silence was held for Reed before Saturday's home game against Ohio, and team captains led the team out of the locker room holding his No. 2 jersey aloft. Players wore helmet decals and jersey patches with Reed's number on them.

Searching: An Ypsilanti police officer uses a flashlight while searching shrubbery lining the sidewalk of a building at University Green Apartments. At least four other attacks have occurred in the area since Reed's murder . The 5-foot-10-inch, 161-pound wide receiver played in six games this season, catching 15 passes for 181 yards and a touchdown. He made 18 receptions for 171 yards in nine games last season. He scored one touchdown. Investigators spent around five hours . at the scene this morning and could be seen through a window in the . stairwell of the hallway where police said the body was found.

She said they were preparing to leave for a party elsewhere. She was questioned by police Friday morning. 'The police asked us questions like was it a party last night, did you hear gunshots or was there anyone lingering around.' A woman who was brought to the scene . by Ypsilanti police detectives cried out in the parking lot just before . the body was brought out. The woman is believed to be one of Reed's family members.

"Manchester City defender Vincent Kompany provided a decent reply when Arsenal supporter Piers Morgan offered him a sports cars and money to swap the north-west for north London this week. 'These days I play for glory,' said the Belgian. As quick witted as it was acerbic, Kompany’s Tweet made his point. The landscape has shifted in English football over the last five years. You no longer sign for Arsenal if you want to win the Barclays Premier League any time soon. Even the ever optimistic Kompany will find little glory in his own team’s predicament at the moment, however, as the City captain does his best to steady a defence currently looking as vulnerable as at any time since Arab money eased his club on to an upwards trajectory six years ago. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany failed to deal with the threat of two-goal hero Seydou Doumbia . Belgium international Kompany, pictured with CSKA Moscow's Alan Dzagoev, struggled against the Russians . Manuel Pellegrini's side have not been at their best during this season's Champions League campaign . Kompany reflected on his side's performance shortly after the final whistle . Football is cyclical, of course. Few things at the really top clubs last forever and City have too many good players in their squad for their current struggles to last. Having said that, they are currently showing few signs of digging themselves out of a defensive slump that threatens to undermine their whole season. Manchester City have tried to pair Vincent Kompany with a number of centre backs during his time at the club but have had little success. The likes of Kolo Toure, Joleon Lescott and Stefan Savic have all been given a chance to hold down a starting berth alongside Kompany - but have all since moved on to pastures new. Eliaquim Mangala, who sealed a £32million move to the Etihad during the summer transfer window, had expected to bolster City's defensive options but is yet to impress. There are other issues currently afflicting this City team. Too many of their marquee players are lacking form. They miss a reliable third striker after the departure of Alvaro Negredo on the back of his wife’s homesickness in the summer. Nevertheless, the sickness that currently drags them down is undoubtedly their work without the ball, their defending. Even the best attacking teams need a platform on which to work and at the moment City just don’t have one. City were as poor as they have been for many years on Wednesday night in that area of the field and there would appear to be a self-belief issue. Confidence – that intangible sporting elixir – can hide a multitude of sins. Equally, when it leaves you it can turn very good players in to shadows of themselves. Look, for example, at the two first half goals conceded by Pellgrini’s team here. Kompany looked dejected after his side loss 2-1 against Champions League opponents CSKA Moscow . The Manchester City defender was not happy with the performance of referee Tasos Sidiropoulos . Martin Demichelis, pictured, and Eliaquim Mangala have taken it in turns to partner Kompany . The first – a free header from a free-kick – was the type of goal Sunday League defenders would go to the pub and fret about. The second, meanwhile, began with a botched clearance from Gael Clichy and ended with a run from CSKA forward Seydou Doumbia that was just too well-timed for the City left-back’s malfunctioning colleagues to do anything about. There were other horror moments, too. Between his two goals, Doumbia raced clear on Joe Hart with far too much ease. On that occasion he was let down by a poor first touch and a shot pulled across goal and wide. Then, shortly after CSKA’s second goal the talented CSKA midfielder Bebras Natcho turned away from Yaya Toure so effortlessly that it was embarrassing. Luckily for City, he couldn’t supplement that act with a pass of similar quality. Let’s not be too hard on Toure. The City midfielder has had a tough week and scored a sublime free-kick equaliser early in the piece. His subsequent sending off – as deserved as it was – was simply born of frustration. Former Porto defender Mangala has failed to live up to his £32million price tag . Piers Morgan took to Twitter on Tuesday to ask Kompany if he would join his beloved Arsenal . Morgan then joked he had withdrawn his offer after the Manchester City star's performance against CSKA . City lost their discipline here. Despite their numerical disadvantage, they could have chased this game down. They had enough quality left on the field. There is a distinct lack of joy about this team at the moment, though, and, it must be said, their manager is showing few signs of finding answers. We have all watched this group of players often enough over the recent months and years to know what they are really capable of. They can be a pretty fearsome, destructive force. At the moment, though, they look vulnerable and fretful and it is surprising. Certainly across the back it would help if Pellegrini could field a settled back four and in particular a regular central partnership. Injuries to summer signing Eliaquim Mangala – back on the bench against CSKA Moscow – and Aleksandar Kolarov have deprived him of that option, though, and for now he must muddle on. The Champions League looks beyond City already. If things don’t improve soon, the Premier League will follow suit by the time the Christmas trees go up.

"Almost 90 new suburbs have made it into Australian property's 'millionaires club' this year, with several unexpected suburbs making the cut along with long-established real estate royalty. The 89 suburbs that made the list varied in location, but they all had one thing in common- an average property price of $1million or more. Among Sydney and Melbourne, strong real estate prices meant that suburbs even a fair way from the CBD were included, surprising real estate agents with price jumps of up to 10% from last year. Scroll down for video . 13 Church Street in South Melbourne is just one of the surprise properties pushing its suburb into the millionaires club . With the recent property boom in Sydney, it is no surprise that NSW boasted more entrants than any other state, becoming the wealthiest property state with 20 new suburbs making the cut. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 25% of all Sydney suburbs are listed for prices of $1 million or more. Suburbs on the list in NSW included Epping, Glenhaven, Ryde, Windsor Downs, Lewisham and Chifley among others. Ashburton, Ripponlea, Fairfield and Caulfield East were surprises in Victoria, all jumping between 17% and 33% in average house price in a year. 47 Underwood Road is situated in Homebush, the suburb which recorded the largest jump in price to $1.184 mil . 76 Seventh Avenue is located in the Adelaide suburb of St Peters, in the North East of the city's outskirts. Bordered by other expensive suburbs, its proximity to luxury may be a factor in the selling price of the house . 67 Nanson Street in Wembley joined the ranks, with Western Australia recording eight additions to the club . In Sydney, Homebush was an unlikely inclusion to the 'millionaires club', with RP Data indicating that the average price for houses in the suburb is now $1.184 million. The suburb, which was once known as a heavy industrial area, broke into the $1million average house price range with the biggest recorded jump of 38.6% in the past year, reported The Australian. 'We know Sydney real estate is really strong, but in some of these areas where you are seeing million dollar price tags, like West Pennant Hills and Frenchs Forest, you are a long way from the CBD and a long way from the water,' said RP Data senior researcher Cameron Kusher. Family-friendly suburb Chifley drew potential buyers to the suburb, with the absence of high-rise buildings being a potential attraction for those looking to invest in a first time home and looking long term, reported The Courier Mail. 14 McHenry Street in St Kilda East may not look like much, but for many millionaire club suburbs, it's all about location, location, location...which this property has in spades . 38 Vineyard Street in Mona Vale is a tidy weatherboard house with only three bedrooms, another surprising property expected to fetch in excess of $1 million when it goes under the hammer this weekend . Suburbs which border other exclusive areas proved to be no surprise, with Adelaide suburbs Malvern, Walkerville, Saint Peters and Leabrook in the North and North East of the city making the cut. 'It is interesting that there are some (other, unlikely) suburbs in the nation's million-dollar median,' said Adelaide agent Rick Harcourt. 'In Adelaide you still get a lot of houses for a million dollars,' he said. Agents were left shocked when an inner-city residence in Camperdown, Sydney, sold for excess of $1 million a few years ago, with the suburb now boasting an average price of $1.017 million. 'Now you are flat out getting a decent two-bedroom house in the inner west for under $1 million,' said agent Prue Holcombe of Belle Property Newtown. In Queensland, Bulimba, Surfers Paradise and Tennyson made the cut, and in Western Australia the biggest jumpers included on the list were Coolbinia, North Freemantle, West Leederville and Bicton.","89 suburbs were new additions to the 'millionaire's club', with houses in the area selling for $1 million or more .

"Offer: The former Newsnight host said he was approached about standing as the Conservative candidate for the mayor of London in the 2016 race . Former Newsnight host Jeremy Paxman has admitted he was approached about standing as Tory candidate for the mayor of London but said he would not do the job for 'all the eclairs in Paris'. Paxman, who has described himself as 'a one-nation Tory', was reportedly asked to enter the field to replace Boris Johnson, who is standing down in 2016. Mr Johnson hopes to return to Parliament next year after being adopted as the Tory candidate for Uxbridge and South Ruislip and the party is yet to find a potential successor. Paxman said the story 'began life as a Boris Johnson joke', adding: 'I was indeed approached about the gig and invited to see David Cameron to discuss the idea. 'I decided a week ago that I wouldn't take it on for all the eclairs in Paris.' Paxman, who recently signed up to work with Channel 4 on its election coverage, bowed out of Newsnight this year after a quarter of a century with the flagship current affairs show. Only one potential Tory candidate has so far come forward to say they want to try for the mayoralty. Earlier this week the businessman and prominent Tory Ivan Massow said that he wanted to represent the party in the 2016 race. As well as Sadiq Khan - who is yet to confirm he is a candidate - several other Labour figures are likely to throw their hats into the ring. David Lammy, the Tottenham MP has put himself forward and, last week, the popular former minister Tessa Jowell, who played a crucial role in the 2012 Olympics, also announced she will also seek the nomination. Labour MP Diane Abbott is expected to announce her bid for the candidacy tomorrow. In 2006 David Cameron suggested that if he were to join the Conservative party and put himself forward, Nick Ferrari, the LBC broadcaster, could win the ballot to be the party's candidate for mayor of London. But Mr Ferrari, who presents the breakfast show, said at the time he 'did not want to leave the listeners' and joked that he 'couldn't take the pay cut'. Party favourite: Mr Paxman (pictured) said that the proposal 'began life as a Boris Johnson joke' and that he was invited to discuss it with David Cameron . Replacement: Only one Tory candidate has come forward to say they want to try for the mayoralty, currently held by Boris Johnson (pictured). Mr Johnson hopes to return to Parliament next year . Mr Paxman spent 25 years on Newsnight but quit this summer this after 25 years. The 64, later told a literary festival: 'I have to be frank — I suppose I am a one-nation Tory, yes.' He said at the time of his reasons for quitting: 'Look,Newsnight is made by 13-year-olds. It's perfectly normal when you're young that you want to change the world. The older you get, the more you realise what a fool's errand much of that is.' His career includes a stint covering the troubles in Northern Ireland and working as a presenter on radio, breakfast TV and the Six O'Clock News before finding the show he made his own. The Leeds-born broadcaster, who studied at Cambridge University, is the author of a string of books including studies of Victorian Britain, politics and fishing, and continues to host quiz show University Challenge.

"From rows over a washing line to eating dodgy food, some of the more unusual ways the Victorians died have been uncovered in a series of notebooks found in a coroners' files. A series of handwritten manuscripts, compiled by Thomas Taylor, County Coroner for Yorkshire from 1852 to 1900, spill the details on the ways more than 17,000 people met their demise. Among the more curious cases is the wealthy Eliza Coulson, whose cause of death was recorded as being from eating bad beef and dubious dumplings in 1868.

"DNA testing has been used to identify the eye and hair colour of human remains up to 800 years old. The new genetic technique is expected to provide intriguing detail about what historical figures looked like. It has already been shown to be a potentially valuable tool for police and forensics experts trying to identify modern remains but has now been shown to be effective for teeth and bones hundreds of years old. Tests on the remains of Polish war hero General W¿adys¿aw Sikorski revealed he had blue eyes. Among the remains tested was a tooth from a woman found, to the astonishment of archaeologists, alongside those of abbots in a monastery near Kraków in Poland. Analysis of a sample taken from the woman, who was buried in in the crypt of the St. Peter and Paul Church in the Benedictine Abbey some time in the 12th to 14th centuries, revealed that she most likely had blue eyes and dark blonde hair. Quite why she and another woman were buried with the monks, however, remains a mystery. The results of analysis of 24 bone and tooth samples was said to show that the system offers a valuable new tool to archaeologists. 'Overall, we demonstrate that the HIrisPlex system is suitable, sufficiently sensitive androbust to successfully predict eye and hair colour from ancient and contemporary skeletalremains,' the research team concluded. 'Our findings, therefore, highlight the HIrisPlex system as a promising tool in futureroutine forensic casework involving skeletal remains, including ancient DNA studies, for theprediction of eye and hair colour of deceased individuals.' Researchers were able to use the technique to confirm Polish World War Two hero General Władysław Sikorski had light blonde hair and blue eyes. A skull from a woman found buried alongside monks in a crypt in Poland. Contemporary accounts described him as having blonde hair and blue eyes but there are no colour photographs of him, while a colour portrait was painted after his death. Sikorski was Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Armed Forces and was Prime Minister of the Polish government in exile until he was killed in an airplane crash at Gibraltar in 1943. After being exhumed in 1993 from a cemetery in Newark his remains were placed in athe crypt of the cathedral of the Royal Castle on Wawel Hill in Kraków. However, in 2008 he was exhumed once again amid doubts the aircraft crash that killed him was an accident. DNA testing confirmed the body in the crypt was his and researchers also took the opportunity to test for eye and hair colour using HIrisPlex. The tests were 99 per cent certain that the General had blue eyes and 69.5 per cent certain that his hair was a light blonde. Dr Wojciech Branicki, from the Institute of Forensic Research and Jagielonian University, Kraków, led the study and said: ‘This system can be used to solve historical controversies where colour photographs or other records are missing. ‘HIrisPlex was able to confirm that General Wladyslaw Sikorski, who died in a plane crash in 1943, had the blue eyes and blond hair present in portraits painted years after his death. ‘Some of our samples were from unknown inmates of a World War II prison. 'In these cases HIrisPlex helped to put physical features to the other DNA evidence.'","Scientists carry out tests on mysterious woman buried with monks .

"For 12 months after police officers from the Democratic Republic of Congo 'summarily executed' at least nine people, including a child, Britain continued to fund them. But just two weeks after the police brutality scandal the first public reports on it were already available. That was on November 15. During the police offensive, named 'Operation Punch', a further 32 men and boys disappeared in the capital, Kinshasa. Two 16-year-olds are amongst 29 of this group who are still unaccounted for. For 12 months after police officers from the Democratic Republic of Congo 'summarily executed' at least nine people, including a child, Britain continued to fund them . And on November 27 the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) and the UN peacekeeping mission in Congo issued a joint statement further highlighting the issue, sighting 'reports of disappearance and assassination of young men and children in some communes of Kinshasa'. According to The Telegraph, at that time, the UN agencies said that about 20 people, including 12 children, had been killed. They urged 'immediate steps' to 'put an end to such acts'. Despite these declarations of concern, the Department for International Development (Dfid) continued to fund Congo's police for almost another year. And it wasn't until this month that they finally suspended their payments to its 'Security Sector Accountability and Police Reform Programme'. It did so following a UN report in October which confirmed nine deaths and numerous other violations during Operation Punch. Between 2008 and 2014 Difid had promised £67million to improve the 'capability and accountability' of the Congolese National Police. By the time it pulled the pin on the programme Difid had already spent £55million. Justifying the continued payments a Difid spokesperson told the newspaper: 'We were aware of reports of human rights violations and raised them regularly at the highest level of the Congolese Government while the UN conducted their investigations. We wanted to make sure that any action followed the outcome of the UN investigation.' The Department for International Development only stopped their payments to the police this month after the UN released their final report in October which confirmed they were responsible for nine deaths . The spokesperson added that they made a 'swift decision' to end the payments following the UN's final report. That report found that nine people were executed during Operation Punch and 32 'forcibly disappeared'. The operation was meant to be targeting organised crime. The report went on to say they believe the number of victims could be 'much higher'. And said the operation involved masked and hooded policemen travelling in unmarked vehicles after dark, before waiting outside the homes of their victims. On November 19, a shopkeeper, 30, was shot dead outside his home by hooded men in police uniforms. On November 23, a 18-year-old was picked up while trying to earn money cleaning cars. After being driven around for a number of hours the teenager was shot three times in the back. The youngest victim was a 17-year-old who was shot in the back outside his home on November 27. Of the 32 who disappeared, there were able to buy their freedom from police custody. One of which is a 16-year-old who was tied up and taken from his home to a nearby police station. Dfid's budget rose by 32 per cent between 2012 and 2013 – the biggest annual jump by a Whitehall department in peacetime history. Critics say the pressure to spend its budget makes it harder for the organisation to cut payments.","In November last year police in the Congo killed nine people .

"An Irish teenager has been charged after threatening to assassinate the president of Guyana in what his lawyer said was an alcohol-fuelled row with two of the leader's bodyguards. Cillian Crosson, a 17-year-old volunteer with an aid group in the South American country, allegedly told the men he would shoot and kill president Donald Ramotar. His defence lawyer, Glenn Hanoman, said the youth made the threat because he didn't really believe the pair were actually bodyguards.

"A mother whose two daughters were trapped inside a submerged car in suburban Minneapolis on Thursday morning went into premature labor after hearing that one of her children had drowned, while the other remains fighting for life. Shaniece Thompson, 25, said the horrifying news of the tragic incident led her to give birth on to a 3lb baby - also a daughter - on the same day that five-year-old Zenavia Rennie died in the accident. Thompson, who was only 32 weeks pregnant at the time, has named the newborn child Dream and she is currently in neo-natal intensive care. Scroll down for video . Shaniece Thompson, 25, said the horrifying news of the tragic incident lead her to give birth on to a 3lb baby - Dream - on the same day that her five-year-old daughter Zenavia Rennie died in the accident . Her other daughter, 6-year-old Zarihana Rennie, continues to battle for life and is listed in extremely critical condition following Thursay morning's incident. Thompson’s daughters were amongst a group of five children trapped in the submerged car that was driven into an icy lake by unlicensed driver Marion Guerrido, 23. She is the mother of the other three children in the car and is also the girlfriend of Julius Rennie, the father of Thompson’s children. Her son Alarious Coleman-Guerrido, seven, died in the crash from complications of drowning. Meanwhile her other children Amani Coleman-Guerrido and baby Aliyana Rennie (whose father is Julius . Rennie) are in a critical condition, but continuing to make strides in their recovery. Their eyes are open and they are most responsive to verbal commands. Thompson told CBS Minnesota that she has a lot of questions about the incident that she wants to ask Guerrido. Marion Guerrido, right, was the unlicensed driver of the car which ended up in a pond in Minneapolis killing two young children, including Zarihana Rennie, left . The officers and firefighters who jumped into the water have revealed that they had to use their feet to pull the kids out of the car . 'I’m angry about the fact she was driving without a license. I’m angry at the fact she put all those kids in a small car,' Thompson said. Rescuers . worked frantically to try and free the children after their vehicle . veered off a highway ramp and into the frigid pond shortly after 6am on . Thursday. The car was underwater for up to 45 minutes after the crash. St. Louis Park city spokesman Jamie Zwilling said the children were unconscious and unresponsive when pulled from the vehicle. Zenavia Rennie of Brooklyn Center, was pronounced dead at around 7.30pm Thursday. An attorney acting as the family spokesman told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that Alarious Coleman-Guerrido passed away before 10pm at Hennepin County Medical Center. The driver, Marion Guerrido, 23, of Brooklyn Center, escaped from the four-door 1998 Pontiac Grand Am sedan and was unhurt. One witness described seeing her in the pond, screaming for help. ‘The car was under water, and she must have been standing on top,' Jeff Robertson told the St. Paul Pioneer Press. ‘That pond is 8 or 9 feet deep, and the water was at her knees.’ Tragic loss: Alarious Coleman-Guerrido, 7 (both photos), died from complications from drowning after being rescued from the freezing pond . Shaniece Thompson, center, has said she has a lot of questions for Marion Guerrido who was driving the vehicle which included her two daughters, one of whom is now dead and other remains in an extremely critical condition . The officers and firefighters who jumped into the water have revealed that they had to use their feet to pull the kids out of the car. 'I've been doing this a long time - 35 years and I've been involved in a lot of rescues. Never seen anything like that before,' paramedic Randy Elledge told MyFox9. Firefighters in special suits that make them float first had to bring the driver, Guerrido, and a Good Samaritan to shore before Tim Smith with the St. Louis Park Fire Department started sweeping the inside of the car with his feet. ‘It was frustrating not being able to access the inside of the compartment and not being able to get in there and do what we could do with our hands,’ Smith said. They pulled out three of the children through an open driver's side window and two more through back windows that Smith broke, then they carried the children to shore where paramedics were waiting to perform CPR. Cause: A police officer investigates the scene where a car carrying six people careered into a holding pond just after 6am on Thursday November 21 . Authorities say the five children were . trapped underwater in the car for about 20 minutes in freezing water on Thursday morning . Four of the five children, including . the two deceased, attended the Odyssey Academy, where little Zenavia had . recently been named a star student. The crash happened about 6:15 am at the . junction of Highways 7 and 100 in St Louis Park, a western Minneapolis . suburb. It is not yet known how fast the car - a green Pontiac Grand Am - . was going. Lt Eric Roeske said the car veered . left off a ramp and plunged down a slope into the pond about 40 to 50 . yards from the roadway. There is no guardrail between the road and the . pond. He told the Star Tribune the car landed in water that was 'quite deep', an estimated eight to nine feet, and was 'incredibly cold'. 'A passerby who jumped in the water was standing on the roof of the vehicle and the water was up to his neck,' Roeske said. All victims were taken to Hennepin County Medical Center and the University of Minnesota Amplatz Children’s Hospital. Asked to comment on whether the crash could have been intentional, Roeske said they were planning to fully investigate the incident, but there was no immediate information that would indicate the crash had happened on purpose. Police say they are still looking into how the kids could ll fit in the four-door sedan and if any of them were wearing seat belts. Video: Mother of drowning victim goes into premature labor .

"When you settle down to the cheese board this Christmas, try not to feel too guilty. It turns out some of the wedges we’ll be spreading over the crackers could actually be good for us. Scientists have found the blue cheese Roquefort – known for its mould and blue-green veins – has anti-inflammatory properties which could help guard against cardiovascular disease. Miracle food?: A report that Roquefort cheese could have massive health benefits have been disputed by a top nutritionist . The cheese, which is aged in caves in the South of France, could be among the reasons why the French enjoy good health despite a diet high in saturated fat – a situation dubbed The French Paradox. A process that occurs as the cheese ripens is good for a healthy gut, helps slow arthritis, and can slow the signs of ageing, such as cellulite, according to Cambridge-based biotech  company Lycotec. Researchers found that the properties of the blue cheese worked best in acidic environments, such as the lining of the stomach. The research, entitled ‘Could cheese be the missing piece in the French paradox puzzle?’, was led by Dr Ivan Petyaev and Dr Yuriy Bashmakov. Zoe Harcombe is a leading nutritionist and disputed Lycotec's claims about Roquefort . It suggested regular consumption by . the French of Roquefort, Camembert and other moulded fermented cheeses . could be one of the reasons the nation has the lowest rate of . cardiovascular mortality in the developed world. The experts said Roquefort’s properties could be extracted and used in pharmaceutical and anti-ageing products. The . report stated: ‘Observations indicate that consumption of red wine . alone cannot explain the paradox and perhaps some other constituents of . the typical French diet could be responsible for reduced cardiovascular . mortality. ‘We hypothesise that cheese . consumption, especially of moulded varieties, may contribute to the . occurrence of the “French paradox”.’ Leading nutritionist Zoe Harcombe, however, was sceptical about the findings. ‘We should not automatically think of inflammation as a bad thing,’ she said. ‘Inflammation is the sign that the . body is healing something (we sprain our ankle, it inflames – that is . the body sending fluids, blood and lipoproteins to the area to repair . the damage).","Biotechnologists say Roquefort may be a 'miracle food' behind French diners' famous good health .

"The Clintons are 'downsizing' their summer home to a simple, $18million house in the pretty Hamptons hamlet of Amagansett. Former President Bill Clinton, 67, and ex-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, 66, are expected this week at the sprawling five-bedroom property, owned by Andre and Lois Nasser, which they have rented for the remainder of the month. Their summer jaunt comes just weeks after Mrs Clinton controversially declared the power couple were 'dead broke' after leaving the White House in 2000. Sources tell MailOnline they are paying $100,000 for their three-week stay - saving $100,000 from last year's luxury rental in Sagaponack. Home for the summer: The Clintons are renting a house belonging to Andre and Lois Nasser in Amagansett, NY . Stunning: This aerial  shot shows just how close the Clintons will be to the water. Their rental property is ringed in red . Vacation: Former President Bill Clinton an ex-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton - seen here on June 12 at the Wildlife Conservation Society's 2014 Gala in New York are renting a $18million house in Amagansett, NY, for the rest of the month . Home owners: Wealthy art collector Andre Nasser and his wife Lois, a real estate advisor to the stars, have rented out their home to the Clintons . Mr Nasser, 67, a collector of primitive art, owned a gallery in New York, and is believed to have made his money with a number of clothing manufacturing plants. He is now said to be 'semi retired'. Public records show that he is a Republican donor-  handing over $2,500 to Mitt Romney's Presidential campaign in 2012. His wife, Lois, is a Senior Global Real Estate Advisor with Sothebys, and her clients are said to include 'celebrities and business leaders'. The property - address 44 Broadview Road - is next door to movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who is a noted Democrat supporter and longtime close friend of the Clintons. It is situated on the top of a bluff, 200 feet up, overlooking Gardiners Bay and Gardiners Island in what's known as the Bell Estate. Writer Blake Fleetwood, who lives nearby in Amagansett, told MailOnline today he had been told the news of the Clinton's impending arrival by neighbors. However, when he asked Mr Nasser to comment, he could only say: 'I can't confirm or deny.' Writing a blog for the Huffington Post, Mr Fleetwood noted: 'The owners of the home the Clintons are renting, like many other chic Hamptons veterans, are getting out of town for August and decamping to Tuscany for the month to escape the usual summer frenzy.' Records show Mr Nasser bought the property in July 2002 for $2,750,000 - but of course, it is now worth significantly more, as Mr Fleetwood wrote it would sell 'for a lowly $18-or-so-million'. He added: 'It's north of the highway and the railroad tracks  - the cheap side of town - which means it's on the bay instead of the ocean.' What is clear is that Mr Nasser has been readying the property for visitors. A source revealed: 'Andre was tearing his hair out as the internet went out a day ago, quickly followed by the thump pump - which takes the s**t to the sewer! He was rushing to get everything done in time.' The Clintons busy schedule may not mean they can spend all their time grilling and embarking on Breaking Bad marathons. As the New York Times reported, they plan to attend a fundraiser on Saturday to raise money for the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, with tickets starting at $5,000 a person - and soaring up to $50,000 a couple for a seat at the head table and an invitation to the Clinton Foundation’s annual spring briefing in 2015. The event will be held at the 6,100-square-foot shingled home in Water Mill, New York, owned by Joan and George Hornig. Mrs Clinton, who has just finished an international book tour to promote her tome, Hard Choices, will also be at the bookshop Bookhampton on August . 16 to sign copies of the new memoir (fans will have to buy copies before being allowed in).

'We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to piece . together the resources for mortgages for houses, for Chelsea's . education. It was not easy. Bill has worked really hard. And it's been . amazing to me. He's worked very hard.' According . to financial disclosure forms, the Clintons had between $2.28 million . to $10.6 million in debt in 2001, but Mrs Clinton went on to clarify her . comments, saying: 'We have a life experience that is clearly different . in very dramatic ways from many Americans, But we also have gone through . some of the same challenges many people have.' Sprawling: Bill and Hillary Clinton last year rented this $11million home in Sagaponack owned by Republican donor Michael Saperstein . Expensive: The Clintons shelled out $200,000 for their summer home last year . She went on to say she regretted the comments, saying: 'It was in-artful'. She told Fusion's Jorge Ramos; 'It was accurate but we are so successful and we're so blessed by the success we've had and my husband has worked incredibly hard.' Today, President Clinton is in Kentucky to campaign for Alison Lundergan Grimes in the tight Kentucky U.S. Senate race. While Mrs Clinton last night appeared on Stephen Colbert's Comedy Central show, where the pair enjoyed an unexpected name-dropping contest. Last year, MailOnline told how the Clintons rented an $11 million Hamptons mansion owned by wealthy Republican donor Michael Saperstein for the month of August. It a was a departure from the eight-bedroom house on Lily Pond Lane in  East Hampton owned by multi-millionaire Elie Hirshfeld, that they had rented for the two years beforehand.. As Clinton appeared on set for her surprise drop in, a 'shocked' Colbert excitedly said, 'Hillary Clinton!' 'Now who's a name-dropper, Stephen?' Clinton said . 'Don't you dare!': 'You were chanting my name four minutes ago, you two-timers,' Colbert said as the audience ecstatically clapped for Clinton and cheered her name . It . was claimed they did not return to the house - which was last year up . for sale for $19.95million -  after receiving a small portion of their . security deposit back because of higher than expected utility costs. The summer break will allow the Clintons some much needed time for introspection. Mrs Clinton is expected to decide whether she will run for President in 2016 by the end of the year . Today, the Mrs Clinton's spokesman . confirmed she had moved her personal office to a Midtown Manhattan . high-rise building - but denied it was the NOT a campaign office ahead . of her potential Presidential run. It is not yet known whether the Clintons daughter Chelsea, who is expecting her first child with husband Marc Mezvinsky, in the fall, will join them in Amagansett.

"A turtle survived a 15 minute fight with an alligator that failed to break its protective shell. An alligator bites down with a force of up to 2,900 pounds of pressure but despite its strength, this reptile was still unable to crack the turtle's shell. Amazing photographs captured the tussle in the wild as the six foot South American alligator attempted to prise the shell open. The South American alligator spent 15 minutes trying to break the turtle's shell but failed . The Eastern River Cooter's shell managed to protect it from thousands of pounds of pressure in the alligator's bite . The Eastern River Cooter's shell managed to protect as it lay helpless in the alligator's jaws. Many academic studies have been carried out into the forces a turtle's shell can withstand. Researchers have been continually interested in the evolution and design of the shell and applying it to human armour. Although the shell protects turtle's from most predators, larger animals such as crocodiles, alligators and even jaguars are normally able to crush the carapace in order to get to the reptile's body. Although expets say the exact strength of a shell depends on the size of the animal, researhers say the animals evolved the shell to avoid being eaten - and as these pictures show, it works. Tiger sharks can also bite through turtles of all sizes and other predators nibble around the softer edges of the armour to pull the turtle out. The protective shell is made from bone covered by a horny shield. Plates of bone are fused with ribs, vertebrae and parts of the shoulder and hip. The shape of the shell also gives it extra strength. The turtle was powerless as it was clamped in the alligator's jaws but survived because of its shell . The fight was captured by American wildlife photographer Patrick Castleberry . The images were taken by American wildlife photographer Patrick Castleberry, 51, who said he was astounded to find the turtle still alive after the alligator had abandoned it. Mr Castleberry, who was studying herons in the Okefenokee Swamp, Georgia, said: 'It was definitely turtle one, alligator nil. 'I was taking shots of a great heron and saw out the corner of my eye what looked like a ball bouncing beside the water. 'I quickly realised what it was and thought the alligator was going to win in the end at cracking the shell. 'When he finally gave up I walked over to the turtle expecting it to be dead and was amazed to find it quite alive and on its back. I flipped it over and it scrambled into the water.' The photographer regularly spends hours on end dressed in full camouflage gear to get up close and personal with nature to capture it at its wildest.","The alligator in Georgia gave up after 15 minutes of trying to break the shell .

But how on Earth — or on Mars — could you look forward to leaving your family and friends behind to go live on the Red Planet? ‘I was up all night waiting for the news,’ said one of the 100 chosen ones, Ryan MacDonald, a 21-year-old student from Derby, doing an MA in physics at Oxford. ‘I got the email from the selection committee at 6am. ‘I felt completely awed and shocked. The fact I now have a chance of going into astronaut training is incredible.’ There are still several hoops to leap through for Ryan and the other four British, aspiring astronauts: Hannah Earnshaw, 23, a PhD student in astronomy at Durham; Alison Rigby, 35, a laboratory technician, from Kent; Clare Weedon, 27, a systems integration manager for Virgin Media, from Surrey; and Maggie Lieu, 24, a PhD student in astrophysics at the University of Birmingham. Ready to leave: Fellow hopeful Ryan MacDonald, a physics student at Oxford University, says that as he knows when he'll leave Earth, he can live life to the fullest . They will be tested on their responses to stressful situations before they find out if they’ve made it at the end of this year. ‘My family, particularly my grandparents, are very pleased,’ insists Ryan, who has wanted to be an astronaut since he was a little boy. ‘Although my grandfather said: “Don’t forget to focus on your studies.” My younger sister isn’t quite so keen.’ Ryan speaks as if he is planning a long-haul holiday: ‘You know a precise date when you’re leaving. So you get ten years to live your life to the fullest, to experience all the wonders the world has. That makes your quality of life much better than if you just live the day-to-day drudge for the next 50 or 60 years.’ Ryan’s plan is to travel as much of the world as possible over the next decade. In the meantime, he will do a doctorate in astrophysics. And if he fails to be selected, he hopes he might get a late call-up if someone else drops out: ‘People change their minds.’ As an astrophysics expert designing a thermal camera for Martian missions, Ryan knows a bit about the tricky living conditions on Mars — certainly a little different from life in his home-town of Derby. It is known as the Red Planet because it’s covered in rust-coloured iron oxide. There’s no liquid water on its surface because of the low atmospheric pressure — 100 times lower than Earth’s. Any water is simply vapour — there’s no pressure to hold it down. L ike Earth, Mars has plenty of ice at its polar caps. During Martian winters, those poles are in complete darkness. When sunlight returns, the poles are hit by 250mph winds — a little brisker than Derby on a blowy day. Temperatures hit −143°C lows at the polar caps, and more reasonable 35°C highs at the equator. Fingers crossed: Clare Weedon, 27, a systems integration manager for Virgin Media, from Surrey, also wants to go to Mars . ‘They have four seasons, like us,’ Ryan says, as if he was talking about a holiday in the Sahara. ‘The dust storm season lasts from summer to late autumn. You can get global dust storms, engulfing the entire planet for 60 Martian days [40 minutes longer than days on Earth]. That will affect our solar panels [which supply power] — we’ll have to ration supplies then.’ Cynics will not be surprised the Mars One operation is being filmed by Endemol, the Dutch company that created the reality TV series Big Brother, which brought out the very worst in human nature. The selected Brits have dismissed suggestions that the training process is more of a publicity stunt for the TV show than a genuine attempt to get humans to Mars. But, if the astronauts do actually reach their destination, many scientists are convinced the trip is not only foolhardy but could be fatal. Experts from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the U.S. have concluded: ‘The first crew fatality would occur approximately 68 days into the mission.’ Low air pressure, a shortage of spare parts for ventilation machinery and the risk of explosion all put human life at risk. Any breakdown in the machinery that would produce food and oxygen would bring starvation and suffocation. The oxygen would be produced by splitting water vapour into its constituent parts, hydrogen and oxygen. Other researchers have said the high levels of radiation would increase the risk of cancer, and reduce the chances of reproduction. It certainly is no picnic. So why is Ryan keen to go? ‘It’s not about running away; it’s about running towards Mars,’ he says. ‘Back in the past — when people emigrated to Australia — that was a one-way trip, too. They couldn’t pay for their way back. They had to wait six months for a letter. I can’t have a live conversation, but I can send friends and family video messages. It’ll take about 40 minutes to get a reply. ‘It’s about starting a new chapter in our life. I’m not going to Mars to die; I want to live there.’ The difference is there’s quite a lot more oxygen in Australia. When the wind drops on Mars, it’s hard to catch your breath — the air is 96 per cent carbon dioxide. Ryan would also face terrifying health problems. Scientists predict that if any human spent more than ten years on Mars, their bone density would decrease and their muscles would waste away. On Mars, the gravitational forces on astronaut’s bodies would be much lower, meaning bones are put under less stress, have to work less hard, and so decrease in mass and density. If people do decide to return home — a seven-month journey which there is no guarantee they could begin because there is not enough power on the planet to launch a rocket — their bones might be so thin that, the moment they took a step on Earth, they might snap. The Mars One boffins’ idea is that, before any humans land on Mars, a communications satellite and robotic lander will go there, followed by an intelligent rover — a small car that will navigate the Martian landscape. Starting life: Maggie is hoping to be able to give birth to the first 'Martian' as part of the permanent colony . These devices would track down a suitable landing site for habitation modules — caravan-like pods — and “plant production units”, where they will grow vegetables and oxygen-producing plants. When the first people arrive, all this will be waiting for them. Still, it’s hardly the Ritz. ‘It will be confined and it will be very difficult for the first crews, but they are the pioneers,’ says Ryan. ‘You have to start somewhere.’ O n Mars, Ryan would have the chance to continue his astrophysics studies and indulge his passion for writing science fiction. It will be harder, though, to indulge his other hobbies — long-distance cycle rides, runs and climbing in the Peak District. ‘Because of the high radiation levels you can only go outside three hours every couple of years,’ he says. Ryan does admit to being scared of take-off and landing — the most risky things on Space Shuttle missions. ‘There’s a three per cent chance of dying on take-off,’ he says, ‘Slightly greater than the risk of climbing Everest.’ Another British hopeful, astrophysics student Maggie Lieu, from Coventry, is keen to be among the first to give birth on Mars. ‘I think that raising a child on Mars is no different than on Earth,’ Maggie writes on her blog. ‘Yes, giving birth on Mars could be dangerous but there is no research to say for certain. ‘Yes, the children of Mars will be in a confined space; however they won’t know any better. What’s more, they will be growing up with some of the most intelligent people of Earth. They will be eating healthy foods, grown on Mars, as opposed to all the junk food we have access to on Earth. ‘They will have an unexplored terrain as their back garden. I couldn’t think of anything better.’ The question of the first little Martians has been considered, too, by Mars One’s chief medical officer, Dr Norbert Kraft,52, a former NASA crew selector. ‘They aren’t encouraged to reproduce,’ he says. ‘You don’t want a little toddler running round — that’s not very wise. ‘We will train them in giving birth, pregnancy and sonography [diagnostic medical procedures that use high frequency ultrasound] just in case an accident happens.’ It would seem inevitable, though, that relationships will be formed on Mars. And dating in space has its pitfalls. According to Dr Kraft, people pairing off into couples would be a complication. He says that such a closed environment would lead to people striking up a relationship very quickly. How the group would deal with such pairings — and any subsequent break-ups — is a key area the scientists are looking at. Dr Kraft says: ‘People need eight to ten years of training to see how they cope.’ Squabbling couples? Affairs and accidental pregnancies? Life on won’t be so different from Earth, after all.","Maggie Lieu, 24, is hoping she will be sent to Mars in 2024 .

"A group campaigning for justice for honeymoon murder victim Anni Dewani (see here with her husband Shrien who is accused of her murder) is calling for the judge presiding over the British businessman's trial to be dismissed over claims she has shown 'bias' in her handling of the case . The judge presiding over the Shrien Dewani murder trial has been accused by an international criminal lawyer of demonstrating 'bias' and legal 'failures' in her handling of the case. The allegations are said to form part of a dossier prepared by a group campaigning on behalf of Dewani's dead wife Anni that is being delivered to South Africa's Minister of Justice, MailOnline can reveal. The group, called Justice4Anni, has compiled a growing petition calling for Judge Jeanette Traverso - one of the country's most senior jurists - to be dismissed and Dewani re-tried fairly. The urgent intervention was announced amid predictions the judge appeared increasingly likely to clear the wealthy care home owner of all five charges relating to the  murder of his new bride on their honeymoon four years ago. Campaigners for the group, which is acting independently from Mrs Dewani's family, said they were 'in it for the long haul'. A spokesman, who did not wish to be identified as he attends court to report anonymously on behalf of the group, told MailOnline: 'We will continue the campaign and explore all possibilities - further criminal and civil routes are being explored. 'We have secured the services of an international criminal lawyer. It is the judge's entire demeanour that we believe to show bias – her inappropriate interjections, her disrespectful attitude towards the prosecution and no regard to the victim or her family.' The judge, who sits without a jury but with two assessors who have no influence over whether the case should be thrown out at this stage, has also been criticised by the lawyer working for the campaign, who has not been named, for her 'failures and bias', the group said. The Hindocha family, who relocated to Cape Town to attend the trial, have also indicated that they will brief the media next week ahead of the judge's ruling on December 8 despite previously saying they would not comment until proceedings had concluded. They fear that if the case is dismissed they would never hear Dewani’s evidence tested in court. But by the end of a highly-charged court session on Tuesday, during which the prosecution argued against Dewani's application to have the case against him thrown out, the grief-stricken family of his dead wife appeared extremely downcast. Ashok Hindocha (above), Mrs Dewani's uncle, said the family were now 'exploring every option' available to them as it dawned on them that Dewani could likely be leaving South Africa a free man within days . Anni Dewani's father Vinod Hindocha arrives at the Western Cape High Court in Cape Town where Shrien Dewani's lawyers have appealed to the judge to dismiss the murder charges against him . In stark contrast, Dewani, his brother, Preyen and sister Preyal, appeared more relaxed than at any point since the trial began last month. Mrs Dewani was found dead after the taxi she was travelling in with her husband of two weeks was carjacked in a township on the outskirts of Cape Town. Dewani and the driver, Zola Tongo, were freed unharmed, while the 28-year-old bride was found the following morning with a single gunshot wound to her neck. Tongo later confessed to organising hitmen to kill the Swedish engineer, but claimed Dewani offered him money to do so. Ashok Hindocha, Mrs Dewani's uncle, said the family were now 'exploring every option' available to them as it dawned on them that Dewani was likely to be leaving South Africa a free man within days. If the judge does dismiss charges against Dewani, the state have no leave to appeal the decision. According to legal experts, the only viable avenue left to the family would be to consider  a civil action so they could hear him give his evidence. Dewani's brother, Preyen (above), appeared more relaxed than at any point since the trial began when the judge earlier this week said she would consider an application to dismiss the case against the businessman . 'The moment we have been waiting for was to hear from Shrien himself,' Mr Hindocha told MailOnline in a phone call from his home in Sweden. 'We are still hoping that he will honour that promise – to tell us what happened, to speak the truth, under oath. 'That's what all of us who loved Anni have been waiting for over the last four years. And now it may not happen.' It seems increasingly likely that Judge Traverso will grant the defence's application to have the case against Dewani dismissed. Legal experts have suggested that if the judge was going to rule against Dewani, and continue with the trial, she would have done so within hours or days. The fact that she requested almost two weeks indicates that she requires time to write a lengthy ruling to justify her decision. Although applications to have charges dismissed – under section 174 of South Africa's Criminal Procedures Act - are not unusual, they are rarely granted. And since the pursuit of Dewani by South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority has been long, expensive and controversial, the judge will need to show that she has thought long and hard about discharging the charges out even before Dewani had to launch a defence of them. The campaign, which was launched on social media in the weeks after Mrs Dewani's death, has attracted 23,000 followers. It has published regular updates of the case against Dewani, who emerged as a suspect in his wife's murder soon after he had returned to Britain with her remains. The self-funded campaign, staffed by anonymous volunteers, has posted legal documents, medical records, CCTV stills, photographs and key questions about Dewani's alleged suspicious comments and behaviour which, they say, he needs to answer before he can ever be free from suspicion. Since the trial began, the judge's demeanour towards the state prosecutors and rulings which have dealt major blows to the case against Dewani, particularly in relation to his sexuality, have attracted widespread comment in the South African media.","Allegations form part of dossier prepared by Justice4Anni campaign group .

"A fossil of the largest known platypus has been discovered in Australia. The remains, which are likely to be between 15 and five million years old, indicate that the ancient creature, which is related to the modern platypus, measured almost a metre in length. Until recently, the fossil record indicated that the platypus lineage was unique, with only one species inhabiting the Earth at any one time. Obdurodon tharalkooschild (reconstruction illustrated) was a giant toothed platypus from the the World Heritage fossil deposits of Riversleigh, Australia. At about one metre in length and with powerful teeth (inset: the holotype, a first lower molar), it would have been capable of killing much larger prey, such as lungfish . However, the discovery of the fossil casts doubt on the theory as the new, giant species of extinct playtypus was a side-branch of the platypus family tree, scientists said. The new platypus species, named Obdurodon . tharalkooschild, is based on a single tooth from the famous Riversleigh . World Heritage Area of northwest Queensland. While many of Riversleigh's fossil . deposits are now being radiometrically dated, the precise age of the . particular deposit that produced the tooth of the giant platypus is in doubt. However, it is . likely to be between 15 and 5 million years old, according to the study in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. 'Monotremes (platypuses and echidnas) are the last remnant of an ancient radiation of mammals unique to the southern continents,' said PhD candidate Rebecca Pian, lead author of the study, which was conducted at the University of New South Wales. 'A new platypus species, even one that is . highly incomplete, is a very important aid in developing understanding . about these fascinating mammals,' she said. Based on the size of fossilised tooth, it is estimated that this extinct species . would have been nearly a metre long, which is approximately twice the . size of the modern platypus. The fossilised tooth was discovered in the richly fossiliferous freshwater limestones in the Riversleigh World Heritage Area (pictured) in northwest Queensland . No living mammal is more peculiar . than the platypus. When it was discovered by Western explorers in 1798, many believed sketches of the animal were a hoax because it seemed to share characteristics of totally unrelated animals. It has a broad, duck-like bill, thick, otter-like . fur, and webbed, beaver-like feet. A platypus' snout is also covered with electroreceptors . that help it detect underwater prey. Modern platypus do not have teeth like their newly discovered ancestor, and resort to using gravel to 'chew' their crustaceans, larvae and worms. Unlike other mammals, the platypus lays eggs instead of giving birth to live young. Male platypus have a venomous spur on . their hind foot. Researchers said the bumps and ridges on the animal's teeth also provide clues about what the species ate. Dr Suzanne Hand, a co-author of the study also at the university, said: 'Like other platypuses, it was probably a . mostly aquatic mammal, and would have lived in and around the freshwater . pools in the forests that covered the Riversleigh area millions of . years ago.' 'Obdurodon tharalkooschild was a very . large platypus with well-developed teeth and we think it probably fed . not only on crayfish and other freshwater crustaceans, but also on small . vertebrates including the lungfish, frogs, and small turtles that are . preserved with it in the Two Tree Site fossil deposit.' The oldest platypus fossils come from 61 million-year-old rocks in southern South America. Younger platypus fossils are known from Australia in what is now the Simpson Desert, but before the discovery of Obdurodon tharalkooschild, these fossils suggested that platypuses became smaller and reduced the size of their teeth through time. The modern platypus completely lacks teeth as an adult and instead has pads with tiny horns on, in its mouth. The name Obdurodon comes from the Greek for 'lasting tooth' and was coined to distinguish extinct toothed platypuses from the essentially toothless modern species. The modern platypus (pictured) is approximatley twice as small as its ancient relative. The living mammal has a broad, duck-like bill, thick, otter-like fur, and webbed, beaver-like feet . Dr Michael Archer, another co-author of the study by the University of New South Wales, said: 'Discovery of this new species was a shock to us because prior to this, the fossil record suggested that the evolutionary tree of platypuses was relatively linear one. 'Now we realise that there were unanticipated side branches on this tree, some of which became gigantic.' The specific epithet of the new species, tharalkooschild, honours an Indigenous Australian creation story about the origin of the platypus. In the Dreamtime, Tharalkoo was a head-strong girl duck inclined to disobey her parents. Her parents warned her not to swim downriver because Bigoon the Water-rat would have his wicked way with her. Scoffing, she disobeyed her parents and was ravished by Bigoon. By the time Tharalkoo escaped and returned to her family, the other girl ducks were laying eggs, so she did the same. But instead of a fluffy little duckling emerging from her egg, her child was an amazing chimera that had the bill, webbed hind feet, and egg-laying habit of a duck, along with the fur and front feet of a rodent - the first Platypus.","The fossilised tooth was discovered in the Riversleigh World Heritage Area of Queensland and is thought to be between five and 15 million years old .

"A six-month old Quokka born in Sydney’s Taronga Zoo has captured the hearts of zookeepers. The female joey, which has been named ‘Meeuk Mia’ or ‘Mia’ for short is the youngest of three Quokkas born at the zoo this breeding season. Keepers say the Quokka will have an important role to play at Toronga’s Eduction Centre, where he will be meeting children and helping them learn about the importance of looking after native wildlife. A six-month old Quokka born in Sydney’s Taronga Zoo has captured the hearts of zookeepers . Quokkas are one of the smallest wallaby species in Australia. They are found in high number on Rottnest Island in Western Australia and in small populations in the south-west of WA. The species have been classified as vulnerable due to their geographical range being limited. The female joey, which has been named ‘Meeuk Mia’ or ‘Mia’ for short is the youngest of three Quokkas born at the zoo this breeding season . Keepers say the Quokka will have an important role to play at Toronga’s Eduction Centre, where he will be meeting children and helping them learn about the importance of looking after native wildlife . Quokkas were once abundant throughout Australia but declined rapidly due to the arrival of the dingo in Australia about 3,500 years ago. Thankfully today they are showing signs of recovery due to the Department of Parks and Wildlife’s operations. Experts say that Quokkas appear to live in territories with the areas defended by dominant males on Rottnest Island. Quokkas are one of the smallest wallaby species in Australia . They are found in high number on Rottnest Island in Western Australia and in small populations in the south-west of WA . According to Tonga Zookeeper Bec Russell- Cook, it is imperative that Quokkas are kept in zoos to stop them from dying out. “If a natural disaster or disease were to hit Rottnest Island it would be devasting for Quokkas, which is why an insurance population is so important,” said Bec. Bec has been caring for Mia since she was born. According to Tonga Zookeeper Bec Russell- Cook, it is imperative that Quokkas are kept in zoos to stop them from dying out .

She loves climbing on the other keepers’ shoulders and heads during morning tea and I even woke up one night to find her looking at me from atop a mountain of pillows next to my bed,” said Bec. Quokkas have thick, coarse, grey-brown fur and short, rounded fluffy ears. Their tails measure 24–31 cm long and they have shorter hind legs than other macropod species. Quokkas are very unusual as they are able to survive in an environment virtually devoid of freshwater and they can climb trees.

For now, Toronga Zoo's resident Quokka Mia’s diet consists of a special milk mixture and the occasional nibble of native grass and flowers. However she will be introduced to solids in the coming weeks. “The 2am bottle feeds are certainly the toughest, as Mia gets tired and falls asleep while she’s drinking,” said Bec. Mia will continue to be nursed by Bec until the joey is old enough to join Taronga’s trio of hand-raised Quokkas, Poppy Lou, Autumn and Jarrah, at the Education Centre.

"The Iranian musician who killed three fellow-rock-and-rollers from the Islamic nation was retaliating for being kicked out of their band, police have revealed. Authorities say Ali Akbar Mahammadi Rafie opened fire before dawn Monday in the Brooklyn, New York, apartment where the members of the group Yellow Dogs lived. He shot two men in their bedrooms and a third in the living room before fleeing to the roof and turning the gun on himself. He used a .308-caliber Century Arms semi-automatic rifle, which police believe he carried to the murder scene in a guatar case. Scroll Down for Video . Accused: Sources identified the gunman in the early Monday killing spree in Brooklyn as Raefe Ahkbar - who turned the gun on himself after shooting three dead . Investigation: Crime scene personnel work at the Brooklyn home where four people were shot and killed last night in a triple murder suicide . Group: Neighbors said the men were part of a Iranian band called 'Yellow Dogs' who were formed in Tehran in 2006 but called Brooklyn home . He shot the band’s . 27-year-old guitarist, Soroush Farazmand, in a second-floor bedroom and . then climbed to the third floor where he killed singer Ali Eskandarian, . 35, and drummer Arash Farazmand - who were brothers. He also shot Sasan Sadeghpourosko, 22, twice in the arm outside the building. He was not believed to be in the band. Rafie was kicked out of the band after stealing 'money and equipment, and he didn’t live up to his end of the bargain,' a police source told the New York Post. Band manger Ali . Salehezadeh said the shooter knew the victims but hadn't spoken to them in months because of a 'petty . conflict.' According to the Post, Sadeghpourosko fought the gunman for his rifle after he was shot twice in the arm. During the struggle, the shooter told the fellow-Iranian, 'Why did you bring me over here [from Iran] and then throw me out,' according to the Post. According to the band's Facebook page, in this photo are: Arash Farazmand, bottom left, Siavash Karampour, top left, Koory Mirz, bottom center, Soroush Farazmand top right, and Ali Eskandarian bottom right .

Commissioner Raymond Kelly said . it appeared to be a dispute over money, but police were investigating . the motive as well as the relationships between the victims and the . shooter. The four victims lived in a row house in East Williamsburg, an . industrial neighborhood home to mostly warehouses where artists can rent . cheaper space than in trendier parts of the city.

"Ever dream of living in a castle? If you’re looking for investment potential, you might be better off saving up for a parking space. This 16th century Scottish castle, complete with turrets and a one-acre garden, is on the market for £375,000. Which is £25,000 less than you’ll pay  for a parking space in some of the posher parts of West London, as witnessed by our example. Kilmartin castle, just north of Lochgilphead in Scotland, has gone on sale for £375,000 . At £400,000 the castle comes in at £25,000 cheaper than this parking space in Kensington, West London . A two-vehicle spot in the underground car park pictured far right will set you back £400,000, showing just how dramatic the real estate divide has become across the country. Knight Frank, the estate agency which is selling the castle, said Scottish castles can fetch between £5million and £6million, but this three-bedroom version is the cheapest on its books. The same money would buy you ‘the cupboard space of a flat in Knightsbridge or the downstairs of a small terraced house in Guildford, Surrey’, according to its research department. The beautiful countryside surrounding the castle offers trout fishing, deer stalking, shooting, sailing and golf . From the basement of this car park the owner of the parking space might catch sight of a fox or pigeon . In fact, the same money plus a little bit more could make you the proud owner of a two-car parking space in a private garage in Kensington, West London, where the ‘average’ price of a home is £1.1million. The castle, called Kilmartin, was bought by its current owners, an elderly couple who use it as a second home, in the 1980s. It was a ruin and they carried out extensive rebuilding and restoration. The owners are such castle enthusiasts that at one point they owned three – two in Scotland and one in Cumbria. The castle was bought as a ruin but the previous owners have brought the interior back to life . As well as an impressive interior, the castle comes with a one-acre garden and its own turrets . They sold off one of their Scottish castles last year and have decided that Kilmartin, which is north of Lochgilphead, Argyll, should also have a new owner. The property offers easy access to salmon and trout fishing, deer stalking, game shooting, sailing and golf. In Kensington, the closest you’ll get to sighting wildlife would be the glimpse of a hungry fox by night. Michael Jones, a partner at Knight Frank, said many people had a romantic dream to live in a castle. It could even appeal to a family looking for a new home. The local village of Kilmartin has a school, post office, a church and a hotel. Other interest has been shown by people looking for a second home or renting it out as a holiday let.","Knight Frank are offering a three-bed Scottish castle for £375,000 .

"The 13-year-old girl who was charged in relation to the bullying and ultimate suicide of a classmate spoke out today after charges were dropped to say she did nothing wrong. Katelyn Roman and Guadalupe Shaw, 14, from Florida, were initially charged with aggravated stalking in the death of Rebecca Sedwick, 12, and were controversially named and shamed by Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd. Florida prosecutors announced last night the charges would be dropped and today Katelyn and her family appeared on the Today show with their attorney Jose Baez to insist the teen did no wrong. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Speaking out: Katelyn Roman, second from left, and her family appeared on the Today show with their attorney Jose Baez to insist the teen did no wrong in the bullying of Rebecca Sedwick . Lesson: When asked if she has learned anything from the experience, the teen said its not OK to bully and people should stand up to bullies before saying . Her father said: 'They had a fight at school and it was all . over with but to then turn around and say [Katelyn] bullied Rebecca was uncalled for . and was it was uncalled for of Grady Judd to put her picture up there. 'Then I had people coming to my house and phoning my house and threatening me and my family. It was crazy.' He also claimed his daughter did not write any of the messages she was alleged to have on Facebook, including telling Rebecca to 'drink bleach and die'. 'Katelyn never said any of that stuff.' When asked if she has learned anything from the experience, the teen told the Today show she knows it's not OK to bully and that people should stand up to bullies before saying: 'I do not feel I did anything wrong.' Baez, the lawyer who was behind Casey Anthony's acquittal, also said today the family are thinking of suing the sheriff for his actions. 'The family are extremely disturbed and we are . looking into every possible remedy at their disposal. His conduct was . reprehensible,' Baez said. Too young: 12-year-old Rebecca Sedwick (pictured above) committed suicide Sept 10 by jumping off an abandoned concrete factory . Suspended: Katelyn Roman, 12, left, and Guadalupe Shaw, 14, right, were booted from school after being arrested for reportedly stalking 12-year-old Rebecca Sedwick until she committed suicide . Baez praised the decision to clear his client of any wrongdoing at a press conference last night. ‘We . are very pleased that the State Attorney's Office, through hard work . and through extreme professionalism, has decided to do the right thing,’ Baez told the Sun-Sentinel. Baez's . juvenile client allegedly told the lawyer that she was sorry for what . happened and referred to herself as a victim after her mugshot was splashed . across newspapers and shown on TV, the New York Daily News reported. Sheriff Judd said that both girls are now receiving counseling to ensure they 'never bully anyone again'. Baez . called the sheriff’s decision to name the two underage girls . 'unconscionable' and ‘reckless', and warned that Judd 'should get a . lawyer and a damn good one'. The girls are no longer in custody and will . have have no further criminal implications related to the suicide of Rebecca. It is not clear if the girl's grieving family will pursue a civil case against the formerly accused. Mr Baez spoke of the unlikelihood his client would be found guilty in a court of law during a previous interview with CBS news. Devastated: Rebecca Ann Sedwick, 12, pictured with her mother Tricia Norman, is said to have had a disturbing upbringing . 'I represent people accused of crimes as . well as victims of crimes. She falls under both categories,' he told CBS. 'My client has been the victim of bullying in . the past and she is currently being bullied by the system.' Both Ms Shaw and Roman were . suspended from school for one year in relation to the incident, it is . not clear how the state dropping all charges will impact that . punishment. A Polk County Schools spokesperson reached by MailOnline declined to comment on whether the formerly accused cyberstalker would be allowed to return to class. A source close to the family previously said the girl's family are worried . about their honor-student's chances of getting back into the public . school system. 'There is no . guarantee that after a year you are allowed back into the public school . system and that is if you are acquitted of all charges even,' the source . said. All charges dropped: Defense attorney Jose Baez will soon announce that all charges against accused cyber bully Katelyn Roman are to be dropped . According to the . source, Katelyn Roman had the third highest state testing score in Polk County . a few years ago but now won't even be able to continue her education . electronically. The two girls were part of a group of 15 girls who were accused of tormenting Rebecca Sedwick at Crystal Lake Middle School in Lakeland, Florida. Polk . County Sheriff Grady Judd said Ms Guadalupe was singled out for arrest . after she posted an insensitive tweet about Rebecca's death. 'Yes IK [I know] I bullied REBECCA nd [sic] she killed her self but IDGAF [I don't give a f***],' Guadalupe allegedly posted. 'We decided that we can't leave her out there. Who else is she going to torment, who else is she going to harass?' he said. But . Sheriff Judd also announced last week that the bullying may have only . been one part of Rebecca's decision to commit suicide. John Borgen, the 13-year-old boy at the center of this tragedy, told MailOnline that he feels partly responsible for the Ms Sedwick's death. Mr Borgen had dated Ms Sedwick before dating Ms Shaw, causing a rift between the trio. 'Guadalupe did not like the fact that I still liked Rebecca,' said the teen boy, 'that I still liked Rebecca and that I'd talk about her.' The teen lamented that the extent of the torture Ms Sedwick was put through has devastated him, and that he wished Ms Sedwick had spoken up about Ms Shaw's tormenting. 'She never said anything to me, not a word. The only person she told was her mother.' 'If I'd have known I could have said something,' he added. 'I miss Rebecca.' Roman was once Rebecca's best friend, but officials said Shaw turned her against Rebecca. Other girls also stopped being friends with her in fear of being . bullied, the sheriff said. 'Several . students corroborated stories of both girls bullying Sedwick on . different occasions, through name-calling, intimidation, threats to beat . her up, and at least one actual physical fight,' the sheriff said. It is believed the bullying started when Guadalupe started dating Rebecca's ex-boyfriend. Witnesses . told investigators she sent messages to Rebecca, calling her ugly, . telling her to 'drink bleach and die', and encouraging her to kill . herself. Rebecca's computer . searches revealed she had searched for ways to commit suicide and asked . questions like, 'What is overweight for a 13-year-old girl' . One of the Florida girl's screensavers also showed Rebecca with her head resting on a railroad track. Tragic loss: Rebecca with her sister Amy . She changed one of her online screen names to 'That Dead Girl.' She messaged a boy: 'I'm jumping.' Polk County Sheriff Judd said Rebecca had been 'absolutely terrorized' by the other girls. 'We can see from what we've been investigating so far that Rebecca wasn't attacking back,' Judd said. 'She . appeared to be beat down. She appeared to have a defeatist attitude. And quite frankly, the entire investigation is exceptionally . disturbing.' Even when her mother took Rebecca out of school, the bullying was carried out online. The . bullying started over a boy last year at Crystal Lake Middle School and . at one point she was suspended for fighting with another student - . believed to be Katelyn. Last . December, Rebecca was hospitalized for three days after cutting her . wrists because of what she said was bullying, according to the sheriff. 'When . she was being bullied at Crystal Lake Middle, she used to come home . every day and tell me how she wasn’t worth anything, that she was ugly, . how she was stupid,' her mother Tricia Norman said after her death. 'And . I said, ''Baby what on earth would make you think that? You’re the most . beautiful person I know and the smartest person I know.' 'The apple doesn't fall far from the tree': Vivian Vosburg, Guadalupe Shaw's step-mother, was arrested for punching young boys . Bullied: Rebecca was withdrawn from her . elementary school after being bullied and was home schooled by her . mother Tricia (right) who says her daughter's death should be a warning . to all parents to be vigilant . 'She put on a perfect, happy face. She never told me,' Tricia Norman told the Lakeland Ledger. 'I never had a clue. I mean, she told me last year when she was being bullied, but not this year, and I have no idea why.' Once . police checked her cell phone they discovered that the bullying had not . stopped, especially on Kik Messenger, Instagram and Ask.fm. 'They would tell her she's ugly, stupid, nobody liked her go kill herself,' Ms Norman said. She has started a Facebook page to try to fight back against online bullies, called Rebecca Sedwick Against Bullying. Ms Norman told 10 News she was inspired to start it after reading her daughter's journal. In . it, Rebecca had written: 'Every day more and more kids kill themselves . because of bullying. How many lives have to be lost until people realize . words do matter?' Ms Norman . wants online bullies to face harsher consequences, and begged other . young victims to stay strong and seek help, adding: 'Don't ever give up, . like Becca did.'","Katelyn Roman and Guadalupe Shaw, 14, were cleared of aggravated stalking charges last night .

"Imran Khawaja, from Southall, west London, allegedly received firearms training at the base run by associates of ISIS, the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (flag of the group pictured) A British Muslim reported to have been killed in Syria ‘came back from the dead’ yesterday when he appeared in a London court charged with training to be a terrorist with an extremist Islamic group. Just days after he supposedly died in the war-torn country, Imran Khawaja, 26, was appearing before magistrates accused of spending up to six months training with a group of British Jihadis affiliated to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), whose fighters are currently sweeping through Iraq. Only last week, keen body-builder Khawaja, of Southall, west London, was reported to have been killed when the terrorist group Rayat al-Tawheed falsely announced his death. But yesterday he appeared in the dock at Westminster Magistrates Court alongside his cousin Tahir Bhatti who is accused of helping Khawaja to buy an AK47 assault rifle and then driving him back from Bulgaria. The pair were arrested by counter terrorism officers at Dover on Tuesday. According to their charge sheets Khawaja is alleged to have ‘engaged in physical training’, bought flight tickets to Kurdistan and released cash from his bank account all with the intention of committing acts of terrorism. The preparation is said to have taken place in January this year. The second charge Khawaja faces is of receiving ‘instruction or training’ in how to use firearms between January and June this year. He is also charged with spending the six-month period at a terrorist training camp. Father-of-seven Bhatti, 44, of Watford, Herts, is accused of driving to Bulgaria to collect Khawaja, among a string of other offences relating to aiding and abetting the alleged terrorist. According to the charge sheet, he allegedly helped Khawaja raise enough money to buy a ‘klash’ - thought to mean a Kalashnikov Ak-47 - and agreed to provide a replacement phone for him. He is also accused of agreeing to help arrange delivery of the phone to Khawaja and helped him to return to the UK by communicating in coded messages. Bhatti, the owner of a taxi firm, is alleged to have bought a P&O ferry ticket from Dover to Calais before hiring a car to collect Khawaja from the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, taking with him a change of clothes and a mobile phone. ISIS fighters, one group pictured, preach an extreme form of Islam and want to create an Islamic utopia. Khawaja is accused of attending a training camp with associated group Rayat Al Taweed . London-born Khawaja appeared in the dock wearing a white t-shirt and sporting a goatee beard and a neck tattoo, while bald and bespectacled Bhatti also wore a white t-shirt. Flanked by four heavily built security men in suits, both defendants spoke only to confirm their names, dates of birth and addresses. Both men were remanded in custody until a hearing at the Old Bailey on June 27. In February this year this year senior security officials warned that around 250 British jihadis have returned from fighting in Syria, and are now suspected of wanting to carry out attacks here. The figure is five times higher than previously thought and includes several ‘veterans’ who have fought in Afghanistan and Pakistan. MI5 and police have already intercepted an alleged serious plot by jihadis returning from the war torn region last Autumn. They were said to be planning a Mumbai-style gun attack on civilians in a crowded place, possibly London. Around 2,000 Europeans are thought to be fighting in Syria, including at least 200 known to the British security services. The man, who was thought to have been killed in Syria, appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court today along with accomplice Tahir Bhatti, 44. Khawaja is charged with two counts of preparing terrorists acts and Bhatti is accused of helping his cousin and agreeing to fund a rifle . It is feared that fighters returning to the UK will seek to radicalise young men in particular to launch terror attacks at home and abroad. Last week the Government announced that Britons fighting in Syria face being charged with terrorist offences when they return home under new laws to limit the threat of attack in the UK. David Cameron and Nick Clegg said they wanted to ensure ‘peace of mind for all that live here’ as they unveiled a raft of new laws in the Queen’s Speech aimed at criminal gangs, people traffickers and child abusers. The new laws would allow people suspected of committing terror offences overseas to be prosecuted in the UK as if the offences occurred on British soil. The government warned Syria is now a ‘breeding ground for terrorists’ after senior Whitehall officials said jihadists returning from fighting in the bloody civil war pose the biggest risk to UK security since 9/11. Tackling the problem has become a top priority for MI5, MI6 and counter-terror police.

"Brenda Gorst, pictured, endured a seven-year 'nightmare' after a botched hip operation and has won £250,000 in damages . A grandmother who was left with her foot pointing 90 degrees in the wrong direction after a surgeon botched her hip operation has won £250,000 in damages. Brenda Gorst developed a life-threatening infection and her leg was left shorter following blunders by a consultant at Abergele Hospital in North Wales. Since her surgery in October 2007, the 73-year-old has endured six major operations to try to correct the problem and faces further procedures to rebuild her femur, hip and pelvis. Mrs Gorst began suffering aches and pains in her hips in her 60s, and was recommended for hip replacement surgery. She said: 'When I woke up from the operation, my leg was black and I was in agony. It took some time to realise something had gone badly wrong.' The pain and swelling in her leg did not subside, and a revision operation was proposed. She said: 'After the second operation, it became obvious that my right foot had started to point east. They tried to put my foot straight using sandbags.' During one of the operations, Mrs Gorst, who now lives in Newton-le-Willows in Merseyside but used to live in Rhos-on-Sea in Wales, contracted an infection. She claims that when she was sent for a second opinion and an X-ray, the new consultant was visibly shocked at what he saw. Mrs Gorst said: 'I was in acute pain, the bruising and swelling was terrible and my leg was twisted in entirely the wrong direction. 'At that point they thought I had a flesh-eating disease. They told me I could be dead in three days. It wasn’t a flesh-eating disease, but it was still a vicious infection. 'My leg is virtually useless. I’ve gone from someone who was active to someone who is unable to do many of the things I used to take for granted.' The hip replacement has since been removed but her leg bone is now fused to the pelvis, shortening Mrs Gorst’s leg by four inches. She won damages following a legal battle with the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board. An X-ray reveals the extent of Brenda Gorst's condition after her hip operation. She has endured six major procedures to try to correct the problem and still faces operations to rebuild her femur, hip and pelvis . Brenda Gorst, right, was left with one leg shorter than the other and turning outwards at 90 degrees, left, following the botched operation . Her lawyer Daniel Lee, of Slater & Gordon, said: 'Her mobility and activity are dramatically reduced as a result of the operation which was meant to give her a new lease of life.' Professor Matthew Makin, executive medical director at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, apologised for the distress caused to Mrs Gorst. He said: 'On behalf of the health board, I am sorry that the care Mrs Gorst received at the time fell short of the standards she deserved. 'We aim to provide excellent care and have looked carefully at this case to make sure mistakes are learned from and cannot be repeated.'","Brenda Gorst's leg was left shorter than the other after blunder by surgeon .

"Ginseng: New research from South Korea claims the herbal remedy, a traditional aphrodisiac, can indeed help men combat erectile dysfunction . It's long been used by the Chinese as an aphrodisiac, but new research claims tablets made from ginseng really can perk up a man's love life. A South Korean study found men with erectile dysfunction improved their performance in the bedroom after taking the tablets for just a few weeks. Although some previous studies have suggested ginseng can help tackle impotence, many have been conducted in mice. The latest research involved more than 100 men who had been diagnosed with erection problems. Impotence affects one in ten men in the UK at some point in their lives. Although drugs such as Viagra, Cialis and Levitra have revolutionised treatment in the last ten years, around 30 per cent of men who take them see no improvement. For these men, the only other options are to inject drugs straight into the penis, or use a pump that manually increases blood supply to the organ. Neither is very popular. While herbal remedies like ginseng have been touted as alternative treatments, the evidence to support their use has been lacking. Ginseng is a plant that has been used for thousands of years to bolster overall health. Impotence, also known as erectile dysfunction, is where a man is unable to get a proper erection. The condition affects one in ten men in the UK at some point in their lives. Most cases are due to narrowing of the arteries that take blood to the penis due to a build of the same kind of plaque that causes heart disease. Erectile dysfunction can occur at any time of life, but it becomes more common with age. As much as half of men over 40 suffer from it, rising to about 70 per cent of over-70s. As with heart disease, smoking and heavy drinking can significantly increase the risk. The root contains several active . substances, called either ginsenosides or panaxosides, that are thought . to be responsible for the medicinal effects of the herb. Scientists at the Yonsei University . College of Medicine in Seoul, South Korea, recruited 119 men with mild . to moderate erectile dysfunction. The group was split into two and while half took four tablets a day containing extracts of Korean ginseng berry, the rest took identical dummy pills. After eight weeks, researchers measured improvements by using a recognised scale called the International Index of Erectile Dysfunction. The results, published in the International Journal of Impotence Research, showed a small but significant improvement in sexual function in the ginseng group compared to those on the dummy tablets. In a report on their findings the researchers said: 'Korean ginseng berry extract improved all domains of sexual function. 'It can be used as an alternative to medicine to improve sexual life in men.'","Ginsend has been used in Chinese herbal medicine for thousands of years .

"A 29-year-old Florida teacher accused of sleeping with a 17-year-old student was hit with yet more charges Wednesday after a second pupil came forward with new allegations. The second student, now 20, was also 17 in September 2011 when English teacher Jennifer Fichter started inviting him over to her apartment where they would cuddle on the couch and watch TV. He says the relationship turned sexual the next month and they went on to have intercourse about 20 times for seven months - sometimes in the boy's bedroom while his mother was away, according to the arrest report. Fichter was initially arrested last week . after the mother of one of Central Florida Aerospace Academy's juniors . found intimate text messages from the teacher on her son's phone. More charges: English teacher Jennifer Fichter is facing 20 more counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor after a second student came forward alleging he had a relationship with her. Pictured above in court last week . Fichter was charged with six counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor last week, and was charged with 20 more counts on Wednesday after the second student's revelations. Neither teen has been identified. Allegations: The second student says he had a relationship with Fichter in 2011, when he was just 17 years old, and that they had sex 20 or so times. The unnamed former student is now 20 . The new charges come just one day after the Polk County School Board voted unanimously to fire Fichter after an investigation into the affair she had with the current student. According to The Tampa Tribune, police said the abuse with the current student began in November when the pair had sex in the early morning hours in Fichter's Toyota pickup truck. The teen told detectives he and Fichter met for sex three times in the parking lot of a Lakeland apartment complex and three times near New Tampa Highway. He also said they had sex four times outside the city in Polk and Hillsborough. Lakeland police said those counties are investigating those incidents. The illegal meetings were discovered by the teen's suspicious mother on January 27. When she noticed her son was not home at 5am and lied about his whereabouts, she looked through his cell phone and found texts from two names. One discussed an 'age difference'. Police said the mom confronted her son, who admitted both names were used by Fichter. The mother reported Fichter to police, however it is not clear why she waited so long. The mother also agreed to speak to Fichter and record the conversation for investigators. During the call, Fichter allegedly admitted she became pregnant with the teen's child and had an abortion. Fichter also said she was in love with the student and wanted to continue seeing him. Scene: Both students attended Central Florida Aerospace Academy where Fichter taught English. On Tuesday, the school board voted unanimously to fire her after an investigation into the relationship she admitted to having with a current junior . 'The victim's mother discovered this relationship after reviewing text messages from her son and she asked that Fichter respond to her residence to talk,' a Lakeland police statement said, according to Orlando Sentinel. 'According to the victim's mother, Fichter admitted to the sexual encounters and professed her love for him.' Fichter was arrested at her Davenport home soon after the conversation, and booked at the Polk County Jail. And the two students at the space academy aren't the only boys Fichter is accused of abusing. The 29-year-old resigned from her job at Robinswood Middle School in Orange County in 2008 after it was reported she had feelings for an eighth-grade student. Fichter is now in jail after being accused of having sex with a minor as many as 30 times in the backseat of her truck . A 40 page report on the English teacher revealed that she told another teacher she had feelings for the boy, and hinted to another student that she wanted to have sex with him. She reportedly said ‘he makes me melt into a puddle with those eyes.’ Her co-worker told investigators that she told her she even dreamed about the boy one night. When asked what it was about, she said, ‘Oh my goodness, it was a goooood dream!’ The report said Fichte and her colleague joked that the remark could get her jailed if ever revealed. An investigation was launched into her feelings for the 14 year old boy. No charges were ever filed against the 29 year old in the 2008 case.

"It is one of the great mysteries: who was the couple kissing outside the Hotel de Ville? The image captured by revered photographer Robert Doisneau at the close of the Second World War became a postcard for an era. Now, around 70 years later, a French-American man has unveiled himself as one half of the passionate duo in 1940s Paris, claiming it was a spontaneous embrace. Mystery solved? An 87-year-old man in Los Angeles claims to be the man in Robert Doisneau's photograph Le baiser de l'hotel de ville (Kiss by the Hotel de Ville) shot in Paris at the close of the Second World War . However, his declaration comes two decades after the photographer told a court the image was set up in response to a French actress who unsuccessfully sued for a share of the royalties. Marc de Mauregne, who now resides in Los Angeles, insists he is right. 'I recognized myself, my hair,' the 87-year-old told Coleman-Rayner news agency, according to the New York Post. 'I think we were going to the movies. The lady was a friend who used to live in my street in Paris. Her name was Rolande Dupuis. Marc de Mauregne, who now lives in Los Angeles, insists he is right and says: 'I was amazed to see the photo everywhere around the world' Marc, pictured in his Los Angeles home his wife, Carol De Mauregne, says he has taken his family back to Paris to see the spot that made him famous . Unveiled? Marc de Mauregne, who moved to the U.S. in 1950, claims he spontaneously kissed his girlfriend on their way to the cinema. He insists he recognizes his hair in the shot although Doisneau said it was a model . 'Memories': Mr de Mauregne (pictured with his wife Carol) said he has not heard from his then-girlfriend since . 'She was a very good friend of my sister. They worked together and we were seeing each other for a couple of years. 'I was amazed to see the photo everywhere around the world.' He said he was heading to the movies with his girlfriend of two years in 1945 when he turned to plant the world famous kiss. 'You can see it is not posed,' he said. Dispute: French actress Francoise Bornet unsuccessfully sued Doisneau for $18,000 and royalties in the early 1990s - prompting the photographer to reveal the shot was staged . 'We were just walking and kissing and somebody took the picture. It's so popular in Paris. 'Everybody just kisses on the street. It's a common thing over there. 'It was taken in probably '45 or '46 right after the war, in Paris, near the opera. It was a very popular corner and place.' The shot was used by Life magazine in 1950 before sweeping the world in 1986 when Doisneau gave permission for it to be turned into a poster. Two years later, de Mauregne - who is now married with children - moved to the United States and has not heard from his former lover since. 'We had a wonderful time. It brings back great memories.' Doisneau was taken to court shortly before his death in 1994 by a couple - including actress Francoise Bornet - who claimed they were the ones photographed in the shot. However, once the case was underway Doisneau dramatically revealed that he had staged the shot with two models. The court dismissed the case. Doisneau's specialty was street photographer. But when he started out as a teenager he was so shy that he would only take pictures of street cobbles. However, by the time Doisneau was 20 he was already a professional photographer. Many of his best images were taken after returning from service in the French Army from 1940 - 1945 in the Second World War. He won a string of accolades before dying aged 81 on April 1, 1994, in Montrouge, Paris.","Marc de Mauregne claims he kissed his girlfriend en route to the movies .

"Underwater military sonar could be killing blue whales, according to scientists. American researchers have found that baleen whale species, which include the world’s largest animal, the blue whale, react to the mid frequency noises by changing behaviour. This includes altering foraging so they . miss out on high-quality prey, which could make them weak and decimate . numbers through starvation. The study, from the Cascadia Research Collective based in Washington, adds weight to environmentalists' claims that the use of sonar disrupts marine animals' feeding habits and can lead to them getting lost. American researchers have found that baleen whale species, which include the blue whale (pictured), react to sonar by changing behaviour. This includes altering foraging so they miss out on high-quality prey, which could make them weak and decimate numbers through starvation . The soundwaves, developed by the military to track enemies beneath the waves, are between 1 and 10 kHz, which is within the human hearing band. They have been blamed for lethal mass stranding of deep diving toothed whales. Sonar is thought to disrupt the animals’ diving behaviour so much  that they suffer a condition rather like ‘the bends’ which human divers can contract if they surface too quickly. The effects on endangered blue whales were virtually unknown. This research claims that sonar can significantly disrupt their foraging and dramatically decrease feeding efficiency. The Navy claims that military sonar is needed to defeat recent technological advances such as quiet propellers being added to modern submarines that make sound detection more difficult. However, it has proven to be one of the most troubling acoustical assaults on marine life, particularly associated with catastrophic strandings of marine mammals. The most common victims have been toothed whales and dolphins, but minke whales have also washed up on the shore after the use of these sonars. Undersea noise blocks animals’ communication. Baleen whales produce low frequency calls that can travel thousands of kilometres through water. Dolphins and toothed whales generate higher frequency clicks used to locate prey. Noise generated by ships’ engines and propellers and by seismic airguns used in oil and gas exploration, produce a range of frequencies that can interfere with both these groups of species.

However, it has proven to be one of the most troubling acoustical assaults on marine life, particularly associated with catastrophic strandings of marine mammals . Dr Jeremy Goldbogen used suction caps to electronically tag 17 blue whales off the coast of Southern California and monitor their response to simulated sonar sound waves from a nearby research vessel. He said: 'Despite using source levels orders of magnitude below some operational military systems, our results demonstrate that mid-frequency sound can significantly affect blue whale behaviour, especially during deep feeding modes. 'When a response occurred, behavioural changes varied widely from cessation of deep feeding to increased swimming speed and directed travel away from the sound source.' Blue whales dive continuously throughout the day to feed on large numbers of dense krill that sustain their huge bodies size. Dr Goldbogen said: “This type of behavioural response that involves cessation of feeding clearly results in reduced foraging efficiency.' Could images like this become a thing of the past? Undersea noise emitted by sonar systems blocks animals' communication, according to scientists. Baleen whales, which include the Humpback (pictured) produce low frequency calls that can travel thousands of kilometres through water . His team of researchers calculated . that a blue whale has a feeding rate of 19 kg of krill a minute before . exposure to sonar sound. When the whale heard the simulated sonar, it stopped foraging for 62 minutes, resulting in a loss of more than a ton of krill. His findings are published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Dr Goldbogen warned the results suggest sonar sound may pose significant risks to the endangered blue whale which, unlike other baleens including the humpback, grey and fin, have not shown signs of recovery off the west coast of North America in the last twenty years. He said: 'Our results provide the first experimental demonstration that individual baleen whales, specifically blue whales, respond to simulated mid frequency sonar.

He said: 'Our results provide the first experimental demonstration that individual baleen whales, specifically blue whales, respond to simulated mid frequency sonar.' 'Management decisions regarding baleen whales and military sonar should consider the likely contexts of exposure and the foraging ecology of animals in predicting responses and planning operations in order to minimise adverse effects.' Nature magazine recently reported that prompt political action may have resulted in a remarkable conservation success for whales and dolphins. The Canary Islands, which used to be a hotspot for mass standings of beaked whales, has had no beachings since the Spanish government imposed a moratorium on naval exercises using sonar in 2004. In 2002, a group of 14 beaked whales fell foul of mid-frequency Navy sonar activity and were beached.","American researchers found that sonar can significantly disrupt blue whales' foraging and dramatically decrease feeding efficiency .

"A teenage girl has sold her brand new dream Jeep so she could buy her friend a vehicle in an astonishing act of generosity and kindness. Chandler Lacefield, 17, gave up her red car, which had been a graduation gift, to buy two smaller cars, so both she and her best friend MacKenzie Sterner, also 17, could have freedom. The girls met at Weatherford High School, Texas in March and bonded over a love of running, cheer-leading and fishing - but Sterner soon became reliant on her friends as her mother could not afford to buy her a car. Act of kindness: Chandler Lacefield, left, has sold her car so she could buy one for her friend, MacKenzie Sterner, right, after the girl struggled to get to and from work and practise . Night out: Sterner, right, can be seen in her new car with her mother, left, and Lacefield, center . After school finished for the year, Miss Sterner got a summer job but struggled with transport to and from her work at The Pizza Place, relying on her mother who also needed to drive to work. She told NBCDFW.com she never knew how she was going to get home. Coming to the rescue, her best friend Miss Lacefield came up with a plan. After spending time in Bali in June, on a mission trip, Miss Lacefield said the idea came to her. She told the news agency God told her to do something big. Keeping it a surprise, Miss Lacefield first asked her mother if she could sell her new Jeep to buy two smaller cars. Then, once approved, she texted Miss Sterner's mother Angel Martin for her consent, and got an enthusiastic reply. 'I AM ABOUT TO EXPLODE,' Martin texted back. Switch: She sold her red Jeep so she could buy a smaller car for herself (bottom) and a car for Sterner . 'We finally talked on the phone, and I was still shocked,' she added to NBCDFW. 'She goes, ""It's something I feel strongly about."" She was so sweet and selfless.' The kind teen began shopping around for somewhere to exchange her Jeep for two smaller cars. At first, few car dealers would help her because of her age, reported NBCDFW.com, but eventually she was able to purchase a 2002 Acura MDX for her friend and a 2011 BMW 328 for herself. Her parents had to take an additional loan to cover her own car. The cars bought, Miss Lacefield finally unveiled her big surprise to her friend on Saturday. She told her friend she had a surprise, before taking her, eyes closed, to the bow-wrapped vehicle. Friends: She bought the car for Sterner, pictured, after being inspired while carrying out mission work . 'Everyone had cameras in my face and finally someone was like, ""That's yours"". And I started crying. It was awesome,' she told NBCDFW.com . Miss Lacefield said thinking back to that moment fills her with joy. 'I was just glad she loved it. I'm glad I did it. I don't regret it at all. I know it's the right choice I made,' she told the news service. The girls have now returned to education - Miss Sterner is back at Weatherford High School, studying and cheer-leading, and Miss Lacefield has started at Weatherford College.

"Hospital waiting room magazines, surfaces and toilets are known to harbour germs. But a new study has revealed a little-known germ hotspot: the hospital elevator button. Research, conducted by physicians in Toronto, compared the amounts of bacteria living on 120 elevator buttons and 96 toilet surfaces at three hospitals. The objective of the study was to estimate the prevalence of bacterial . colonisation on lift buttons in large urban teaching hospitals. Results: The presence of bacteria was 24 per cent higher around lift buttons than on toilet surfaces . To find out just how the dirty hospital surfaces were, researchers took samples from two interior buttons and two exterior buttons. For the toilet surfaces, swabs were taken from the exterior and interior handles of the entry door, the privacy latch, and the toilet flusher. They found that the prevalence of colonisation of elevator buttons was 61 per cent, while in and around toilet surfaces it was just 43 per cent. Scientists said the kinds of bacteria most commonly found - Coagulase-negative staphylococci - had 'low pathogenicity,' so are unlikely to make people unwell. But, patients may still be at risk from disease, they warned. 'Patients . remain at potential risk of cross-contamination because of the frequent . use of these buttons by diverse individuals,' the study authors wrote. 'In addition, a visitor is more likely to come into contact with an . elevator button or a toilet than with inanimate hospital equipment and . may transmit organisms if interacting with inpatients.' Killer bugs: The study found superbugs, like MRSA, pictured, and C-difficile were among the infections lurking on the button panels . The researchers suggested placing more alcohol-based hand sanitisers in hospitals, specifically outside lifts, as they are effective for removing surface bacteria. They also put forward the idea of enlarging elevator buttons to allow for elbow activation or installing touchless proximity sensors. Increased public education about hand hygiene was also suggested.","Physicians in Toronto compared bacteria found on toilet surfaces with those extracted from the button panels in lifts .

"Helen Jones was told there is a 'high likelihood' she will face jail when sentenced next month for obtaining the CCTV footage . A 'practised and persistent' liar policewoman who stole CCTV footage allegedly showing former England captain Steven Gerrard fighting in the street so that it could later be used to blackmail him is facing jail. Helen Jones obtained the footage taken in Formby, Merseyside, on August 4, after 'flashing her badge' at the manager of a bank which captured the scuffle on CCTV. The 33-year-old, who tried to claim she was helping out a friend, was not working for Merseyside Police at the time after taking a sabbatical months earlier. The footballer then received 'demands and threats' from a man claiming to have been assaulted by him and his friend and contacted police. After refusing to tell the court who she gave the tape to, Jones admitted misconduct in public office at Preston Crown Court. Previously lawyers acting on behalf of the footballer denied he had been fighting, claiming he was acting as a peacemaker between friends. Jones was today released on bail but warned there is a 'high likelihood' she will face jail when sentenced in the new year. Local businessman Paul Lloyd claimed Mr Gerrard 'threw the first punch' in the alleged scuffle in August. He would not reveal whether he had received the footage from Jones, nor did she tell the judge who she gave the video to. Her account that she pursued the footage for 'philanthropic' reasons was discounted by the judge as 'wholly implausible'. 'I regret to say that I found her to be a witness with no credibility,' said Judge Stuart Baker. 'I am satisfied so that I am sure that the defendant obtained the copy of the CCTV footage so as to enable someone else, whether it was to be Paul Lloyd or another person, to use it in any way that person chose to use it, possibly as a lever to cause Mr Gerrard to pay money to suppress it or, at the very least, to use it in a way which would potentially cause embarrassment as has in fact occurred.'

"The BBC was accused of more ‘leftie bias’ in its coverage of Baroness Thatcher’s death yesterday after its main news website was filled with negative articles about the former Prime Minister. At one point, the corporation’s online home page contained seven stories emphasising the controversies of Lady Thatcher’s time in office and repeating accusations made by her critics, including the suggestion she was ‘racist’. Readers reacted angrily in a second day of fury at the BBC’s coverage, accusing it of being ‘out of touch’ and ‘terrifically biased’. The BBC has faced criticism for its 'biased' coverage which focuses on the former prime ministers controversies . Margaret Thatcher's legacy and controversies has been scrutinised  by the broadcaster - and subsequently slammed by readers . So far, the corporation has received 766 complaints over its coverage of Lady Thatcher’s death. Instead of focusing on the tributes flooding in from around the globe, for much of the morning editorial chiefs chose to give top prominence to an article about left-wing anger over the prospective cost of her funeral. The BBC says it has not yet decided whether to play a Wizard of Oz song driven onto the charts by a virulent anti-Thatcher hate campaign. The track – Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead – has risen to No 10 in the midweek charts on the back of a Facebook and Twitter campaign by those revelling in Baroness Thatcher’s death. If it is still in the official charts at the weekend, the BBC will be forced to decide whether to give it airtime during its weekly top-40 countdown on Radio 1. A spokesman said: ‘We will make a decision when the final chart positions are clear.’ Beneath it, prominence was given to an . article reporting Australian foreign minister Bob Carr, who had . described Baroness Thatcher as ‘unabashedly racist’ in a television . interview. There was no corresponding article reporting her many fans. Another piece, entitled ‘She never really understood sport’, accused Lady Thatcher’s Conservative government of presiding over a series of ‘devastating sporting disasters’. A fourth article focused on her celebrated ‘Right to Buy’ scheme, which allowed council house tenants to buy their properties, extending home-ownership to millions across the country. But instead of celebrating the policy’s achievements, the article, entitled ‘Right to Buy: A Tainted Gift?’ gave prominence to critics who said it led to a shortage of social housing. Writing on political blog Guido Fawkes, one reader said: ‘Even the Biased-BBC’s headline “Hague justifies cost of funeral” – is terrifically biased. No other paper is even questioning the cost. ‘They are as out of touch and as doomed as the Guardian.’ Another said: ‘The BBC has become a case for privatisation. 'Then these lefty fat cats feeding greedily off the public will see whether we want to pay for their propaganda, or their endless interviews with yesterday’s loony left. And we’d get the proceeds of the sale towards debt.’ A third added: ‘The only mistake the Lady made was not to sell the BBC to the highest bidder.’ Richard Christopher tweeted: ‘Still the Anti Brit BBC gets away with leftie bias.’ Yesterday, a BBC spokesman said the news website displayed a selection of ‘recent stories’ chosen by an editor and the ‘controversy’ over the cost of the funeral was ‘the top story at the time’. He added: ‘A variety of news stories about  Baroness Thatcher, exploring a number of angles and featuring a range of voices and opinions, have been displayed on the home page throughout the day.’","Readers reacted angrily to BBC's coverage, branding it 'terrifically biased'

"Philip Hughes’ death was possibly the saddest day in Australian cricket history, but despite the millions of tears shed by the game’s fans the world over, the spirit of the man still remained among those who knew him best. The fact is that Hughes will live on forever in the hearts of those he left behind. Over the last few days many of those had gathered in Sydney from all over the country to show support for his family and friends. On Thursday night the same people met at the Sydney Cricket Ground to reflect on Philip’s life and the impact that he had on theirs. It was a sad and quiet occasion, but also a memorable one. Scroll down for video . Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland looks at a floral tribute after speaking to the media at the Sydney Cricket Ground . Everything that happened in the past few days was tragic but this was the chance to tell some great stories about Hughes the fun-loving joker. Described as 'the cheeky little boy that came down from Macksville' by Cricket Australia CEO, James Sutherland, laughter was never far away when he was around, and it was no different on this occasion. But life must go on, no matter how torturous it may seem. No one knows this better than the Australia squad who were all at the SCG on Friday discussing if they were up to playing the first Test against India at the Gabba in Brisbane on Thursday after Hughes' tragic death. For many his sudden passing is still too raw. Playing cricket at any level is the last thing on their minds with close friends, captain Michael Clarke and David Warner still devastated.

After the team session, Clarke left the SCG with Australia's team doctor, Peter Brukner, who knows better than anyone what his team captain has gone through these last few days. Choking back tears, Brukner made a special tribute to Clarke in Thursday's hugely emotional press conference, saying that 'Philip's always been like a little brother to Michael.' It all means that next week's first Test in Brisbane is still very much up in the air. Tributes to Australian batsman Phillp Hughes gather at the entrance of the Sydney Cricket Ground . However, the 25-year-old maybe be gone, but he's not forgotten. Around 200 people attended the event at the SCG on Thursday night that went on until the early hours of Friday morning. The whole front bar area was full and people spilled into the players’ dressing rooms where some had quiet moments of reflection. Others were walking out on the pitch thinking of their favourite memories of Hughes. Current and former Australian players have paid tribute to Philip Hughes who died on Thursday . Players past and present were everywhere. Ricky Ponting, Glenn McGrath, Craig McDermott, Stuart Clarke, Simon Katich, Phil Jaques, and Mitchell Johnson - who had just got in from Perth on Thursday afternoon - were just a few of those present. Andrew Jones CEO of Cricket New South Wales (NSW) added that the event was arranged at only hours’ notice, and meant a huge amount to everyone at NSW and to players and officials from all over Australia. David Warner (left) and Australian captain Michael Clarke (right) arrive at NSW Cricket headquarters at the Sydney Cricket Ground for a team meeting on Friday . ‘It was wonderful to see the Australian cricket community come together last night in what was a special and moving few hours at the SCG involving players from all over Australia,’ he said. “It was wonderful, albeit horrendously sad, to have them here. Everyone came together in a difficult time.” The outpouring of grief for tragic Philip Hughes (right) - playing for Australia against Pakistan in a T20 match in Dubai last month - has united a country . But Hughes’ loss was not only felt in his homeland. One of the most poignant messages on Thursday night came from Middlesex county cricket club in England where he played for a short while. A young boy writes a tribute to Australian batsman Phillp Hughes on a cricket bat at the Sydney Cricket Ground . ‘He is, and always will be, fondly remembered here at Middlesex even in the short time he played for us. His average of 136.5 alone gives you the impression he left on us,’ the message read. ‘But most of all we remember a laidback, fun-filled, young man who was kind to everyone. What a great talent he was.’ Floral tributes were mounting at NSW cricket headquarters at the Sydney Cricket Ground following the death of Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes . Cricket Australia doctor Peter Brukner (left) and Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke (right) look to have a lot on their minds as they leave Sydney Cricket ground on Friday .

Flower bouquets and remembrance cards were also already sitting outside the NSW cricket offices on Friday morning. Philip Hughes' sudden death has generated tributes across Australia including this one at the Sydney Cricket Ground . ‘All over the country people were putting bats in their back yards and front windows in his memory. We thank all the people for those tributes,’ Sutherland said.

"A Boston man has been indicted in the brutal killing of a 24-year-old woman and in three unrelated non-fatal attacks. Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley and Acting Police Commissioner Bill Evans announced the indictments Friday against 29-year-old Edwin Alemany. Alemany has pleaded not guilty in the death Amy Lord, a Wilbraham native living in South Boston. He is held at a state psychiatric hospital for evaluation. Scroll down for video . 'Serial attacker': Edwin Alemany, 29, pictured here in August, was indicted in the July murder of 24-year-old Amy Lord and attacks on three other women, one of which took place in September 2012 . Much-loved: The 24-year-old was a high school cheerleader and Bentley University graduate . The indictment also charges him in two . attacks on women the same week Lord was killed, and in a 2012 attack in . which the alleged victim grabbed his wallet and told police, according to Boston.com. Police officials have demoted a detective they said failed to pursue the 2012 case, and reprimanded three supervisors. Lord's body was found in July in a wooded area of Hyde Park in Boston . after the woman was kidnapped, viciously beaten, forced to withdraw . money from several ATMs, and ultimately stabbed to death. She . was one of the three young women attacked in the same area in a 24-hour . period. Alemany is suspected of carrying out all three. During a press conference Friday announcing the indictment against Alemany, District Attorney Conley insisted that the 29-year-old man was of a sound mind when he savagely murdered Lord. ‘The level of violence visited on her shocked the entire city of Boston, including hardened police and prosecutors with decades of experience,’ he said. ‘But it was not the beginning or the end of Alemany’s violent sprees.’ After Alemany was identified as the prime suspect in the killing, it was revealed that Boston police may have had the chance to arrest him a year earlier after he allegedly attacked another woman. The incident happened September 28 at around 2.30am in the Mission Hill section of Boston, where Alemany allegedly assaulted a 20-year-old woman from behind and tried to choke her, according to the station NECN. However, the victim put up a fight and managed to snatch her attacker's wallet containing his ID card and knocked off his baseball hat before he fled. The attack was reported to police, but Alemany was never questioned. Today, Conley said that the DNA evidence collected from the cap was 'strongly consistent' with Alemany's DNA. In the aftermath of the revelation that Boston police had failed to do their due diligence while investigating the 2012 attack, a detective was demoted and three other law enforcement officials were punished. Alemany has been suffering from mental health issues since he was a teenager and has had multiple run-ins with the law, mostly for minor property crimes like trespassing and theft. Conley said it is unclear at this time what triggered Alemany to turn violent and launch random attacks on young women walking alone in the afterhours. Alemany is being held on $3million bail. He will be formally arraigned on all the charges in December. Suspect: Edwin Alemany is led from district court in Boston after he was arrested on July 25. He was put on suicide watch in jail .

Amy Lord, a digital marketer, left her Dorchester home at 5.30am . to take a bus downtown to go to the gym with a friend, The Boston Globe reported. But she never made it to the gym.

Video surveillance shows someone - . purportedly Alemany - pacing back and forth in front of Amy's building . and then forcing her back inside when she came out. After the murder, officials said Alemany spent $400 in cash on a cellphone and paid some . cellphone bills. His defense attorney Jeffrey Denner . told the judge today that his client had tried to kill himself by tearing open . arteries with his bare hands, leaving him with self-inflicted scratches . to his neck and arms. Not guilty pleas to the murder and . kidnapping charges were entered on Alemany’s behalf and he was ordered to be . held without bail. Friends: Amy Lord, center, was abducted by two men at knife point and stabbed repeatedly before her body was dumped in a wood . Police released this picture of Amy Lord, taken by one of the ATM surveillance cameras as she stepped out of her black Jeep the day she was killed . Last respects: Friends and residents of Wilbraham gather at Gazebo Park for a candlelight vigil for Amy Lord after she died . In the other incidents, a 22-year-old woman was attacked at Andrew Square at . 5am on the same day. Conley said Alemany knocked her to the ground and dragged her by the legs to a parking lot. 'He allegedly told her he wasn’t going to rob her – he was going to kill her,' the district attorney said. Just after midnight the following day - about 18 hours after . Amy Lord was killed - the 29-year-old suspect allegedly attacked a 21-year-old . woman outside her home and began stabbing her. The woman cried for help, . prompting her attacker to flee. She was rushed to Tufts Medical Center with wounds to her . neck, face and torso. Once there, the victim gave a detailed description of her . assailant. In an ironic twist, Alemany badly cut his hand on the knife . used in the attack, Conley said, and went to the same hospital as his victim.

We as a town think the kids have gone through enough.' Frein faces charges of ambushing state police barracks September 12, killing one trooper and wounding another.

As Friday neared and Frein hadn't been caught, trick-or-treating and what would have been the 50th anniversary celebration of their Halloween parade were canceled. Kids still managed to celebrate by 'trunk-or-treating' at a tailgate party held Sunday at a school parking lot, and organizers said that was a success. Children turned out for activities including face painting and a costume contest, and to see dozens of car trunks decorated for the spooky holiday. Oh, and to get lots of candy. 'Great day': Pike County District Attorney Raymond Tonkin, with Pennsylvania Governor Tom Corbett (R), addressed the media after Eric Frein was captured on Thursday after a massive seven-week manhunt . 'It really was a great day,' said Cheryl Jones, a member of the township's Halloween parade committee. The committee had originally planned to hold the 50th anniversary of the town's Halloween parade on Sunday, but authorities said the logistics would have presented problems during the manhunt. The event draws participants from all over the region, and includes marching bands, floats, costumed revelers throwing candy and thousands of spectators gathered along a main road, committee chairwoman Betty Oppelt said Thursday. 'The Halloween parade is a big, big, big deal,' Oppelt said. 'This is not a rinky-dink parade.' They planned to celebrate the 50th in 2015.","Treak or treating is going ahead in eastern Pennsylvania after suspected cop killer Eric Frein was captured .

"Every small child knows the panic of losing sight of its mother in the supermarket, and as these delightful pictures show, small whales obviously feel the same way. Taken by a British diver who was following the sperm whale calf, they show the minute the baby - who had lost track of its mum - found her again in the sea off the Azores. Soaring 30ft across the waves, the euphoric newborn slammed its body onto the water with joy after becoming separated from its family group in the chilly waters. The newborn sperm whale calf leapt out of the water and slammed its 12ft-long body onto the sea to tell its mother it had found her again . But the adorable whale calf was doing more than just jumping for joy. British biologist and dive guide Justin Hart, 44, who took the pictures, says that young whales communicate with older ones in the ocean by creating a slamming sound which travels through the water to the ears of the adults deep below. By leaping out of the water and slamming its 12ft long body onto the surface of the sea up to 30 times, the baby whale is telling its relatives where it is so they can regroup. He said: 'We had been following the sperm whale calf for most of the day. 'Sperm whales, of all the whales and dolphins, are the species that dive the deepest and for the longest time. 'The calves have to follow what's going on below them from the surface as best they can - probably listening to the echo location clicks of the adults. The newborn whale had become separated from its family group when they swam deeper to hunt squid . Breath-taking sight: Despite being only a few months old, the whale calf measures 12ft long . 'However sometimes the adults re-surface far out of sight of the calf - and in this situation the whales often breach or leap out of the water causing a large bang as their bodies hit the surface. Mr Hart, who is originally from London but now lives on Pico Island in the Azores, said in this way, the whale family could regroup and the calf could suckle if it needed to. He added: 'When I took the photo two adults females had just resurfaced and the calf quite literally began jumping for joy.' Mr Hart captured the rare image four miles from the port of Lajes do Pico while he was working as a crewman on an underwater documentary with special licence to film sperm whales in the area. The baby whale slams its body onto the water to tell the adults where it is so that they can regroup . The sperm whale pod was photographed four miles off the island of Pico in the middle of the Atlantic . Diver Justin Hart, who is originally from London, is living in the Azores and working on a whale documentary . Sperm whales live in nearly all the world's oceans in pods of about 15 to 20 animals and they practise communal childcare. When the baby is fully grown adult it will weigh up to 45 tonnes and be nearly 60ft long - around the same as two double decker buses end-to-end. Mr Hart said the sperm whales dived deep to hunt squid in what is called the mesopelagic zone, around 600 metres under. He said: 'This is a problem for the calves as they do not have the capacity to follow their mothers there when they leave the surface to forage. 'The calves do not have to follow their mother too closely as sperm whales have a system of surrogacy whereby the calf can take milk from any milk-producing female in its social group.'","Newborn whale calf had temporarily lost its mother in sea off the Azores .

"The Ohio teacher whose skull was crushed by a five-pound rock dropped through her car windscreen from a Pennsylvania overpass is recovering from her sixth surgery - and celebrated with a birthday party. Sharon Budd turned 53 at home on Thanksgiving Day after what doctors branded a 'miracle' recovery. Incredibly, the mother-of-four was walking, talking and in good spirits despite enduring a sixth operation just a week earlier to remove contaminated parts of her plastic skull reconstruction. Incredible: Sharon Budd, pictured with her daughter last month, is in good spirits after a sixth operation . Celebration: Sharon Budd rings a ceremonial victory bell outside Geisinger HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital in Danville, Pennsylvania on Tuesday - signaling that she is ready to return home after three months . Her husband told The Repository in Canton she was out of her hospital bed within days. Mrs Budd, a middle school teacher and breast cancer survivor, had five surgical procedures in three months to after four teenage boys allegedly threw a rock at her family car during a road trip to New York. Doctors were forced to remove a portion of her facial bones to ease the brain swelling. But despite suffering brain damage, a crushed skull and losing an eye, Geisinger HealthSouth Rehabilitation Hospital in Danville, Pennsylvania, gushed about Mrs Budd's upbeat survivor's spirit left a huge impression on caregivers. 'She’s just improved by leaps and bounds. She’s walking all over the facility. She walks in and lights up every room. She has such a great personality and is such a pleasure to work with,' Sharon’s physical therapist Chelsea Matukaitis told WNEP. For her part, though, Sharon remained modest even as medical staff and relatives gushed about her recovery outside the health center, where the 52-year-old mother rang a ceremonial bell, as is tradition for patients who've fought long battles there. 'Just unbelievable that that many people know who I am and know the story and things,' but, she said, she's 'very excited about going home.' Her husband, too, marveled at Sharon's recovery. On the road to recovery: Mrs Budd has been recovering for three months after a rock was thrown from an Interstate 80 overpass in Pennsylvania and shattered her skull. She lost her right eye in the incident . 'She’s so strong and I don’t know how she did it. To be able to walk out there and answer these questions out here in front of everyone is a miracle,' Randy Budd said. Helped by two staff members, she grinned as she rang the ceremonial victory bell. The couple planned to return home to Uniontown, Ohio on Wednesday. When previously asked what was the first thing she wanted when she got home, she told PennLive: 'A loaf of bread and an entire package of English muffins. I'll stand by the toaster for an hour and a half.' She was the front-seat passenger of her family's car as it drove through Danville on July 10 with her husband and daughter, when the rock crashed through the front window and struck her head. Budd, who had just finished speaking to her son before he was deployed to Afghanistan, suffered a crushed skull and brain damage. She also lost her right eye. She has  - but has suffered setbacks with seizures. Support: She is pictured with her husband Randy ahead of her departure from the rehab center . Excitement: Randy Budd speaks to his wife on Tuesday as she prepares to head back home to Ohio . Strength-to-strength: Mrs Budd suffered brain damage but is able to manage simple math, her husband said . Her husband said on Tuesday that her sense of humor has returned, she is able to walk and she has regained limited vision in her left eye. Her long-term prognosis remains uncertain. 'They told us to look at this a year from now to give a measurement of how Sharon's going to be, who is Sharon going to be,' Randy Budd said. She can perform simple math and knows who the president is and that it's 2014, Randy Budd said. But she can be confused about how many children she has or how she got hurt, he said. 'Some basics, she doesn't have,' Randy Budd said. 'That's to be expected. The brain has to reconnect itself.' But there are encouraging signs so far, he said: 'She could have come back bitter, violent, aggressive, but she came back as kind of her sweet self.' Life-changing: Sharon is pictured left with her husband Randy and right before the July 10 crash in Danville . Injuries: A scan shows how Mrs Budd's skull was shattered after she was hit by the massive rock . By her side: An image shared by family shows the Budds dancing in Sharon's hospital room in September . 'This word gets thrown around a lot, but I really believe the angels came down to help her,' he said. Four young men face charges in the attack. One of them testified at a preliminary hearing in August that they set out to do damage that day, starting with shoplifting and driving through a corn field and ending up on the Interstate 80 overpass shortly before midnight. Keefer McGee, 18, testified under a deal with prosecutors that they laughed as they drove away from the scene after hearing the noise of the rock hitting the Budd family's vehicle. Proud: Sharon Budd, left, was struck by a rock thrown from an overpass as her family drove on I-80. Moments before, she had spoken with her son Lucas (right), who has been deployed to Afghanistan . Fighter: Mrs Budd, pictured with her husband, three sons and a daughter, will return to Ohio on Wednesday . 'They weren't looking for a car to hit in particular,' said McGee, who told the judge he had been involved in unspecified earlier rock-throwing incidents. 'Like, they weren't waiting for one. They hit one as they saw it.' He drove them back to the Lahr home, where they began to watch a movie before deciding to return to the scene to see what happened — twice. During one of those trips, an alert police officer noted their license plate, leading investigators to the four. Budd's husband Randy recalled the horror of that evening during the hearing. 'It felt like an explosion,' he testified, calling his wife's injuries the 'most gruesome thing that I've ever seen.' 'I'm pretty sure I was looking at brains and skull and she, remarkably, kind of came to but wasn't saying anything,' he said. 'She was just jerking, grabbing her head, so we were holding her hands down.' Accused: Brett Lahr, 18, left, and his brother, 17-year-old Dylan Lahr, and two others have been charged with aggravated assault and conspiracy charges in the shocking incident three months ago . One of the four told police that the oblong-shaped rock was dropped by Dylan Lahr, 17. The lawyer for the only defendant who did not waive his preliminary hearing, Brett Lahr, 19, said this week he was glad to hear Sharon Budd was being released but maintains criminal charges should not have been filed against him. 'Just because you're riding along with people who do some stuff, and even alleged to have laughed if it happened, which we dispute, does not mean you should be even tried for a crime,' said the defense attorney, Brian Manchester. 'You have to have some active involvement.'","Sharon Budd turned 53 on Thanksgiving Day a week after 6th operation .

"Liverpool defender Alberto Moreno says he is relishing playing in their new 3-4-3 formation - citing the tactical change as beneficiary to the players capabilities in the squad. Reds boss Brendan Rodgers has tinkered with their shape throughout the season, which has seen 4-3-3, 4-2-3-1 and 4-1-2-1-2 systems all deployed with varying results. However, the Anfield outfit seem to have settled on a back three as their base with left-back Moreno now playing more offensive as a midfielder.

'I played as a winger when I was younger. I really like this formation as I can attack more, which is one of the things I like to do the most on the pitch,' he told the club's official website. 'Of course, we also have defensive duties but this system gives me more freedom to attack. I like this formation as I think it suits the type of players we have very well - and things are unfolding well as a result. We'll continue to improve as a team if we keep doing things as we have.

"A 'psychotic' boyfriend strangled and stabbed his partner because he believed she had been possessed by the devil, a court heard. In the weeks before he killed Gemma Finnigan, 24, her live-in boyfriend Daniel Johnson, 32, had developed a bizarre interest in conspiracy theories and aliens and even his own sister described him having a look of 'pure evil'. Miss Finnigan’s body was found in the bedroom at their home in Boldon Colliery, Tyne and Wear, on September 13 last year after Johnson had been found wandering around his old school in Kenton, Newcastle, shirtless and acting strange. Daniel Johnson, 32, killed Gemma Finnegan (pictured), 24, after becoming convinced she was possessed by the devil, the court heard. She was found in her bedroom in Boldon Colliery, Tyne and Wear . Police had forced their way into the address after Miss Finnigan, who was originally from Jarrow and worked in a café at Frederick Street, South Shields, could not be contacted. At the police station after his arrest, Johnson switched between acting like a dog on the floor of his cell to threatening to cut someone’s throat. Prosecutor Jamie Hill QC told Newcastle Crown Court: 'He actually killed Gemma Finnigan believing that she had been possessed either by the devil or an evil spirit, that appears to be the conclusion. 'Against that background, I anticipate doctors will say if that is the case, he did not know what he was doing was wrong, he thought he was killing the devil, protecting her and himself at the time. 'In those circumstances that would mean he was in a delusional state and insane in law.' Police and Forensic teams secure off a house and surrounding area of the house where Gemma Finnigan was murdered . Johnson, who is currently being held at Rampton secure hospital in Nottinghamshire and has waived his right to attend his trial, denies murder. Mr Hill told jurors Johnson admits he carried out the killing but pleads that he is not guilty but insane. Mr Hill said three experts have concluded Johnson was suffering paranoid schizophrenia and was psychotic at the time of the killing. The court heard prosecutors do no invite a verdict of guilty to murder in the case and jurors have been advised they will be asked to consider the alternatives of guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and not guilty but insane. Police and Forensic teams the property in September last year . Mr Hill told jurors Miss Finnigan had met Johnson in 2008 while he was on day release from an open prison following a 'substantial' sentence. The couple had lived together at the flat in Boldon for three years when Miss Finnigan was killed. Mr Hill said Johnson had a minor psychiatric background and had been treated for mild depression in 2010 and 2011 but there was nothing to hint at the 'calamitous deterioration' which took place. The court heard it was about two weeks before the killing, Miss Finnigan had grown concerned about Johnson’s behaviour and had even booked him in to see a doctor the day before her death but he had refused to go. Mr Hill said: 'Gemma started reporting to family members that Daniel Johnson had become interested firstly in American conspiracy theories then had started staying up at night, he bought a telescope and was looking at the stars. 'There was suggestions he was concerned about extra terrestrial aliens. 'She would find him sometimes, in the very early hours of the morning, kneeling by the bed, praying. 'He had started to say strange things, suggesting he was in possession of special knowledge. 'His behaviour became increasingly bizarre. 'His own sister, who saw him two days before he killed Gemma, described him having a look of pure evil on his face.' The court heard on the morning of September 13 a neighbour heard what must have been the fatal attack, where Miss Finnigan was strangled and then stabbed, between 3.30am and 4 am. At 7.30 that morning he was found inside Kenton school, where he was a former pupil, and was arrested. After family and friends heard of his arrest, concern for Miss Flannigan grew until the police forced entry to the flat and found her body. The trial continues.

"Kendall Jones' Facebook shots of herself smiling alongside her rare safari trophy kills may have been taken down, but she's now replaced them with shots of herself alongside living animals as she struggles to repair her public image. Despite the thousands of people who've lashed out over Kendall's photos, the teen scored a victory Thursday when another account was removed for threatening her with violence. The move came after the 19-year-old Texas Tech cheerleader's dad Cody Jones demanded the removal of the page 'Kill Kendall Jones' that featured posts condemning the huntress as well as a picture of a lion smiling atop a dead hunter. Public relations? Kendall, who's said she's gunning to get her own hunting TV show, has posted more sympathetic photos since the public outcry over her hunting shots . But the victory may be short-lived. A second Kill . Kendall page had already cropped up Thursday afternoon as online . petitions to stop the self-proclaimed hunting conservationist continued . to draw global animal lovers' signatures. Facebook . has deleted trophy photos showing rhinos, elephants, lions and leopards . killed or tranquilized by the Texas Tech cheerleader. Jones . has sparked outrage across the social media site for sharing images of . herself with the big game she has hunted through Africa. Fair game? A mock Facebook page called 'Kill Kendall Jones' cropped up in the wake of the controversy over a Texas teen college cheerleader's Facebook pictures featuring her rare African trophy kills . 'Credible threat': Facebook removed this page by Thursday despite initial claims from Kendall's supporters that their calls to have it taken down had been rebuffed . In . a statement, Facebook said it removes 'reported content that promotes . poaching of endangered species, the sale of animals for organized fight . or content that includes extreme acts of animal abuse'. The decision sparked outrage from Jones' father, who sent to TMZ the response he got from Facebook saying the anti-Kendall page could stay. Facebook has since removed the page for representing a 'credible threat of violence' toward the teen. Following the removal of Kendall's images, she shared a Fox News Channel montage of . the deleted photos but by Friday, there was no sign of the montage. Removed: Facebook had taken down this photo of Kendall Jones, 19, with a lion that she hunted in Africa. The social networking site said that the image - and others - violate their standards . It came after more than a quarter of a million animal lovers signed a petition urging . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to take down the photos in which Jones smiles . proudly over the corpses of her prey she claims to be saving from . extinction. 'For the sake of all animals,' the petition against Jones reads as it implores . animal lovers to sign, 'especially the animals in the African region... where hunters are going for fun just to kill an animal!' After starting the social media firestorm, the cheerleader hit back at her attackers by saying she is actually protecting wildlife. In a typo-laden defense that invokes . the safari-loving 26th U.S. president Teddy Roosevelt, she claimed . killing rare rhinos and elephants helps to save them. 'This . is a conservation effort to assure [sic] that they never do become . extinct,' the teen from Cleburne, Texas posted to Facebook. Gone: Facebook has also removed this image of her with an elephant. It said it removes 'content that promotes poaching of endangered species... or content that includes extreme acts of animal abuse' '[Roosevelt] . was a hunter too, right? He killed the same species that hunters now . chase today under a mound of anti-hunting pressure. 'Yet, . how can it be possible that someone can love the earth, and take from . the Earth in the name of conservation? For some folks, they'll never . understand. For the rest of us...we were born that way. God Bless . Teddy,' wrote Jones. Jones, whose Facebook indicates . she 'is looking to host a TV show in January 2015,' said here isn't . always space for threatened species like elephants or lions. 'Controlling the male lion population . is important within large fenced areas like these,' Jones writes. 'Funds . from a hunt like this goes partially to the government for permits but . also to the farm owner as an incentive to keep and raise lions on their . property.' 'This is a conservation effort!': The Texas Tech cheerleader said she is helping the animals by killing them . Big 5: Jones says her first kill was a rare African white rhino, part of her quest to bag the Big 5 African game animals (rhino, elephant, Cape buffalo, leopard and lion) Legal: The young hunter has many critics but also a lot of supporters who say what she's doing is fine, since she pays the governments of African countries to kill the animals . Jones' photos showed her posing with bagged zebras, hugging a dead leopard, and smiling beside elephants she had killed. One . particular photo, in which she posed alongside an extremely . endangered rhinoceros, had her critics especially steaming, but the . Texas Tech cheerleader says it was alive and well. 'The . vet drew blood, took DNA samples, took body and head measurements, . treated a leg injury and administered antibiotics. I felt very lucky to . be part of such a great program and procedure that helps the White Rhino . population through conservation,' she wrote. However, . Jones has in her quest to bag the Big 5 African game animals (lion, . elephant, Cape buffalo, leopard, and White/Black rhinoceros) shot a . white rhino, which number around 20,000. Because . of her enthusiasm for killing rare game and what they say is her . dubious standing as a conservationist, some critics say Jones should be . banned from hunting in Africa completely. Pride: Jones learned how to hunt after she went with her father to Africa for his own hunts at age 9 . 'Cruelty': Critics say she is not . a conservationist and is simply trying to get a television deal with the pictures . Boasts: 'This time I got my leopard,' she wrote a safari when she was 14.  'And also took down a hippo' A second petition, this one on change.org and originating from South Africa, is hoping to do just that. 'Kendall . Jones is an American born hunter who has entered the continent and has . been hunting African wildlife under the facade of conservation,' reads . the petition. It . continues: 'She has publicly stated that she hopes to have a television . hunting show and she is using endangered and helpless African animals as . a stepping to further her popularity on social media platforms.' But she also has her supporters. A Facebook account, Support Kendall Jones, has also started. 'Support this teenage girl who was attacked for posting pictures of her game that she legally harvested while in Africa,' reads the page.

"People should be allowed to use cannabis to help treat their medical conditions, Nick Clegg said today. The Deputy Prime Minister said cannabis should be available in a 'straightforward legal way' to help people alleviate their symptoms. Mr Clegg's remarks came after new academic research revealed users of super-strength cannabis, known as 'skunk, are three times more likely to suffer psychotic mental illness than people who don't take the drug. Scroll down for video . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said cannabis should be available in a 'straightforward legal way' to help people alleviate medical symptoms . Overall, a quarter of new cases of psychosis can be blamed on the super-strength strain of cannabis, according to research published in the Lancet medical journal. Mr Clegg this morning insisted he did not want to legalise 'skunk' and other dangerous drugs and insisted it was 'bone-headed' to lump all substances together. Speaking on his weekly call-in on LBC, the Lib Dem leader said it 'strongly' agreed that cannabis for medicinal use should be given the go-ahead. The Home Office has consistently rejected calls for cannabis to be legalised for medical use – pointing to 'clear evidence cannabis can damage people's mental and physical health'. Opponents of allowing cannabis for medical purposes insist it could be used as a back door to decriminalising the drug more widely. Campaigners say cannabis can be used to help conditions such as MS and glaucoma, as well as the side-effects of treatment for cancer, Aids and Crohn's disease. People should be allowed to use cannabis to help treat their medical conditions, Nick Clegg said today . Super-strength cannabis is associated with one in four new cases of psychotic illness, new research has revealed. Scientists at King's College London found the potent form of the Class B drug - known as 'skunk' - led to a three-times higher risk of psychosis in casual users, rising to a five-fold risk in those who used it every day. The findings of the six-year study, published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal, suggest strong forms of cannabis can lead to serious mental illness, the researchers said, as they called for greater public awareness. But it comes as a US neuroscientist suggested long-term recreational cannabis use has no significant association with long-term mental decline. Sir Robin Murray, professor of psychiatric research at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience IoPPN at King's and senior researcher on the study, said: ' It is now well known that use of cannabis increases the risk of psychosis. However, sceptics still claim that this is not an important cause of schizophrenia-like psychosis. 'This paper suggests that we could prevent almost one quarter of cases of psychosis if no-one smoked high potency cannabis. This could save young patients a lot of suffering and the NHS a lot of money.' While skunk was associated with psychotic episodes, the milder form of cannabis known as hash had no such link, the scientists said. Dr Marta Di Forti, lead author on the research, said: 'The results show that psychosis risk in cannabis users depends on both the frequency of use and cannabis potency. The use of hash was not associated with increased risk of psychosis. 'As with smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol you need a clear public message. 'When a GP or psychiatrist asks if a patient uses cannabis it's not helpful; it's like asking whether someone drinks. As with alcohol, the relevant questions are how often and what type of cannabis. This gives more information about whether the user is at risk of mental health problems; awareness needs to increase for this to happen.' It came after a caller to his weekly phone-in on LBC said cannabis helped alleviate his MS. The caller said cannabis was a 'medicine' which helped thousands of people. He asked Mr Clegg: 'Why are you not doing more about it? I would like to get your word – I would like to get an agreement from you – live on LBC that you are going to do more to make this a big issue because this really does affect people's lives. We need access to legal medical cannabis.' Mr Clegg replied: 'Basically agree with you. I strongly agree with you that where there is a proven medicinal use for cannabis for instance we should make that easier for those to have access to it in a straightforward legal way in order to alleviate the symptoms that you clearly have that you know as a user are alleviated by the use of cannabis.' He said Skunk was very different, because it had a link to psychosis. Mr Clegg: 'If you are anti the harm drugs do you should be pro-reform.' 'This slightly bone-headed approach which says you treat all drugs in exactly the same way, you treat everyone who's ever had access to drugs in exactly the same way – you chuck them in jail. 'We chuck 500 people a year for using cannabis for personal use into jail. Yet, we allow the Mr Biggs who paddle the really nasty drugs, we let them walk scot free? 'Let's take a more intelligent approach – where there is a clear medicinal use, make sure you have access to that in a regulated way. 'Come down much, much more heavily on the people who paddle the really harmful drugs – bring drugs out from the shadows.' Mr Clegg's remarks come just days after bombshell academic research revealed the true damage caused by cannabis abuse. According to research carried out by King's College London the potent form of the drug – known as 'skunk' – is so powerful that users are three times more likely to have a psychotic episode than those who have never tried it. Skunk is thought to account for around for 80 per cent of the UK drug market and is believed to be more addictive than normal herbal cannabis or its solid form, hash. According to Crime Survey figures for England and Wales, more than a million youngsters aged 16 to 24 smoke cannabis. Regular users are most at risk of a psychotic episode, prompting experts to warn that youngsters need to be aware of the dangers of skunk, which has been cultivated to be four times as strong as cannabis smoked by previous generations. The researchers, led by a team at the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London, conclude there is an 'urgent need… to inform young people about the risks of high-potency cannabis', despite a worldwide trend towards relaxing drug laws. They will reveal there is a key difference between potent skunk strains and ordinary 'hash'. Those who used these 'weaker' forms did not seem to suffer the same increase in risks. Home Secretary Theresa May has rejected calls for cannabis to be legally available for medicinal use . Psychosis is defined as a form of mental illness where people experience delusions, hallucinations, or both at the same time. Associated with conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, some victims are so badly affected that they end up committing suicide or seriously harming others because they believe they are being ordered to do so by voices in their heads. The findings will add substance to a 2012 report by the Schizophrenia Commission, which recommended the need for 'warnings about the risks of cannabis' to mental health. Last year Mr Clegg pledged to abolish prison terms for users caught with any drugs, including class A substances such as cocaine and heroin. It was 'utterly senseless' to lock up the 1,000 people a year convicted of possession, he said. The law currently allows drugs firms to develop medicines based on cannabis under a licence granted by the Home Office. One such medicine, Sativex, is already authorised for use in the UK for the treatment of MS. However, a Home Office spokesman said: 'This Government has no plans to legalise cannabis or to soften our approach to its use as a medicine. 'There is clear scientific and medical evidence that cannabis is a harmful drug which can damage people's mental and physical health. Our cross-government strategy remains clear. 'We must prevent drug use in our communities, support users through treatment and recovery, and tackle the organised criminals behind the drugs trade. 'There has been a long-term downward trend in drug use over the last decade. 'Drug-related deaths in England and Wales have continued to fall during the past three years and people going into treatment today are more likely to free themselves from dependency than ever before.'","Nick Clegg said cannabis should be available in 'straightforward legal way'

"A 12-year-old girl who is accused of trying to kill her friend to honour Slender Man still believes in the fictional character six months on, her attorney says. Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier have been charged with attempted murder and face up to 65 years in prison for allegedly stabbing their friend 19 times after a sleepover in Waukesha, Wisconsin, on May 31. The girls reportedly planned the crime to demonstrate dedication to Slenderman, a character who appears in stories on the website Creepypasta. Beliefs: Morgan Geyser, pictured in court in June. She is accused of trying to kill her friend to honour Slender Man still believes in the fictional character six months on, her attorney says . Accused: Geyser, left, and her friend Anissa Weier, right, allegedly planned the stabbing for five months . Morgan's attorney said Tuesday that her mental state has not improved and he will challenge a state doctor's determination that she is fit to stand trial. Wisconsin Judge Michael Bohren ordered the girl to receive mental health treatment in August after a state psychologist testified the child claimed to see and hear things that others could not, including Slender Man, unicorns and characters from the Harry Potter and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series. A different doctor filed the latest report on her condition, which was sealed by the court. Co-defendent: Weier, also pictured in court over the summer, has a competency hearing next month . Victim: Payton Leutner, pictured on ABC in September, had stayed at a sleepover with her two friends the night before and was lured to a wooded area the next morning. She managed to crawl for help after the attack . Defense attorney Anthony Cotton said Geyser still believes fictional characters are real, and he would have a doctor he hired testify about that during a December 18 hearing. 'We don't think anything has changed in terms of her functioning,' Cotton said. The case cannot proceed unless Bohren is confident the girl can understand and help with her defense. The Slender Man is a fictional character prevalent on the internet after originating as a meme in 2009. The mythical creature is often depicted as an unnaturally tall, thin figure with a blank, featureless face, wearing a black suit. The character is said to have long, tentacle-like arms, which can be extended to capture prey. It is said to stalk, abduct and traumatize children and, depending on interpretations of the myth, can cause memory loss, insomnia and paranoia. It is also said to be able to create distortions in photographs and teleport. It is understood to have originated in a photoshop contest on the Something Awful Forums in 2009. It then went viral with numerous works of fan art and short scary stories published online known as 'creepypasta'. Cotton said the treatment Geyser has received at a mental health institution is 'markedly better' than the care she had before August, when she was held in jail. 'Right now, she has one-on-one care, she has social workers, she has doctors, she has therapists,' he said. 'There's professionals who can look at her and monitor her and be involved in the sort of day-to-day treatment. 'Jails aren't equipped to do those types of activities, and they're certainly not equipped to do those things for children in most cases.' Geyser would likely be sent back to jail if Bohren found her fit for trial, Cotton said. According to court documents, the pair plotted for months before attacking Payton Leutner during a walk in a wooded park following a May 30 sleepover in Waukesha, about a half-hour west of Milwaukee. The victim, who was stabbed 19 times, survived by waiting until her attackers left and then crawling to a path where a bicyclist found her. All three children were 12 at the time. The two girls were found walking toward a national forest where they believed the specter lived in a mansion. The second girl charged in the attack also has a December 18 hearing scheduled on her mental state. Wisconsin law requires suspects in severe crimes to be charged as adults if they are at least 10.","Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier have been charged with attempted murder .

"Embattled CBS News war reporter Lara Logan alienated her colleagues with her insatiable appetite for risk, and got her security firm in Iraq fired after her ex walked in on her with another man. In a fascinating expose, New York Magazine has shed light on the South African journalist's spectacular rise to the top spot of chief foreign correspondent at the CBS evening news and 60 Minutes and how her equally stellar fall from grace thanks to a Benghazi report that turned out to be fabricated means question marks remain about her return. Logan cut her teeth in London before convincing her employer - morning show GMTV - to send her to Kabul, Afghanistan, following the 9/11 attacks, knowing immediately that the fallout in the Middle East was the story of her career. Scroll down for video . Future remains in question: Journalist Lara Logan of CBS News, pictured in Camp Victory in Baghdad, Iraq November 17, 2006, has still not returned to 60 Minutes since she broadcast a story on the Benghazi attack that turned out to be fabricated . In November 2001, the bold move paid off. With no reporters on the ground, CBS enlisted Logan to cover the fall of Kabul for the evening news. She found a satellite and dispatched a report. The coverage was immediately noticed, not just at the top of CBS News but competing networks. She soon had negotiated, with the help of an agent, a $1million full-time contract at CBS including work on a 60 Minutes spin-off. 'She's got t*ts and balls,' is how the late 60 Minutes correspondent Ed Bradley summed up Logan's appeal, according to New York. But her brazen attitude rubbed some people up the wrong way. New York revealed that some producers considered her difficult and many colleagues found her 'almost insatiable stomach for risk' hard to deal with. Sources told the magazine that one of her security detail was shot during a trip to Pakistan to see an al Qaeda training camp and, after a time, cameramen in the London bureau of CBS News 'revolted' against her, fearing for their safety. 'They thought she was dangerous and she was going to get somebody killed,' a CBS executive told New York. She also flouted traditional Islamic dress codes, which inevitably put herself and her entourage in precarious positions. However, CBS chairman and CEO Les Moonves loved her and she knew it. '[Logan] was very fond of saying, ""I could end your career with a phone call,""' a . former CBS producer told New York of the reporter. The . in-depth article also reveals how Logan had CBS's security team fired . after her ex caught her in a compromising position with another man - . now her husband Joe Burkett. In a fascinating expose, New York Magazine has shed light on the bombshell South African journalist's spectacular rise to the top spot of chief foreign correspondent at the CBS evening news and 60 Minutes and her equally stellar fall from grace thanks to the October 27, 2013, Benghazi report, pictured . Big scoop: Finally, after months with no leads, 60 Minutes producer Max McClellan was offered an exclusive: the first look at a book by a man claiming to have witnessed the attack, pictured . Logan was protected by a team of former British special forces soldiers employed by Pilgrims Group who guarded the CBS bureau in Baghdad and transported her to the various dangerous locations she needed to be for stories. But her patience with the company was wearing thin, New York reported. By late 2007, Logan has been seeing renowned Australian correspondent Michael Ware, who worked for Time and CNN, for some time but had Burkett in the wings. Burkett was a government contractor in Baghdad whose company did public relations for the military, trying to get positive war stories into print. He began paying regular visits to the CBS compound and on one such amorous visit, Ware sprung the pair after security let him up to her quarters on the second floor. According to New York, Ware and Logan began to argue. With tensions high, Logan blamed Pilgrims for letting Ware up when they knew she was with Burkett, and she pulled the contract, giving it instead to their rival company Blue Hackle. This showed her clout at the network. 'A lot of people were p*ssed,' a former CBS News employee told New York, adding that the Pilgrims security team had befriended many. But CBS News boss, Jeff Fager, wasn't fazed. In fact, he seemed somewhat . proud when news broke of Logan's Baghdad affairs, hanging a framed copy . of a New York Post story headlined 'Sexty Minutes' in his office. Not long after, Logan . returned to Washington, D.C. with Burkett, and they had their first . child. However, she'd been promoted to chief foreign correspondent so . was always jetting to war zones for stories. She . was on the front line at the uprisings in Egypt during the Arab Spring, . still her brazen self despite having a family back home. 'She was told 15 different ways: ""Do not leave the hotel after curfew,"" and she did,' a source told New York. Lovers: Lara Logan and her husband Joseph Burkett are pictured at the 2013 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner (left) while reporter Michael Ware is seen right . Early career: Lara Logan is pictured here as a reporter for British GMTA in 2002. From there she moved to Kabul where she was noticed by CBS . On February 3, Logan was detained by Egyptian security forces and her local driver was badly beaten. She flew out the next day, but within a week she was back, unable to keep away from the brewing chaos in Cairo. However, this time things got even more ugly. In Tahrir Square, Logan said that she and her crew began getting verbal threats from the increasingly violent crowd. Logan described being separated from her security team and then a mob of men ripped off her clothes and assaulted her. When she returned to the U.S. she had immense support from her colleagues, however she struggled to return to the field, New York reported. She was handed soft stories and quickly grew restless. President Obama winding down American military involvement in the Middle East also made for fewer war stories in general. But then came the attack on the Benghazi, Libya, consulate in 2012. This offered a return to form, and, according to the magazine, Logan pounced on the opportunity. She was determined to get the scoop on what happened, and no other 60 Minutes correspondent was allowed to pursue stories on Benghazi. 'This was her story, and nobody could do anything on it,' a 60 Minutes staffer told New York. Finally, after months with no leads, 60 Minutes producer Max McClellan was offered an exclusive: the first look at a book by a man claiming to have witnessed the attack. Assault: In this February 11, 2011 photo released by CBS, 60 Minutes correspondent Lara Logan is shown covering the reaction in in Cairo's Tahrir Square the day Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak stepped down. CBS News says Logan was attacked, and suffered a brutal beating and sexual assault before being saved by a group of women and an estimated 20 Egyptian soldiers . On leave: Logan and producer Max McClellan were both put on an indefinite leave of absence last year, as CBS scrambled to salvage the long-running 60 Minutes reputation . The Embassy House, was written under the pseudonym Morgan Jones, by former military contractor named Dylan Davies, and was published by Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon & Schuster. Davies claimed he saw it all and that he even witnessed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens's dead body lying in a hospital bed. For a number of reasons, including the fact the book was being published by CBS's sister company, the program skipped its usual fact-checking procedures. According to New York, Logan nor anyone else called the State Department or the FBI to check Davies' claims before they went to air and the senior vice-president of standards and practices, Linda Mason, who would have scrutinised the authenticity of the report, left in early 2013 and hadn't been replaced. After much hype, the show was broadcast October 27, and former State Department officials under Hillary Clinton were immediately suspicious of Davies's account. 'I think he's lying his head off about where he was and what he did,' a former official wrote in an email to a colleague while watching. 'I mean, 14 months later we're hearing about this guy for the first time?' Soon after, the Washington Post revealed Davies had told his own firm, Blue Mountain, a contrary story. From there, it escalated. Simon & Schuster pulled the book from the shelves early November. After defending the report, finally the evidence was overwhelming and Logan was forced to admit 'we were wrong' on CBS This Morning. Logan and McClellan were both put on an indefinite leave of absence, as CBS scrambled to salvage the long-running program's reputation. Fager reportedly refused to fire Logan and said at the time that she would return to the programme sometime this year. But New York reports that the atmosphere is toxic within the network at the moment, and, as the months roll by, the date of Logan's return remains uncertain. CBS News declined to comment to MailOnline.","New York magazine shed light on South African journalist's spectacular rise to top spot as chief foreign correspondent on CBS evening news and 60 Minutes .

"A deluxe hotel resembling two half moons on the horizon will be built a mile off the coast of Doha in Qatar at a cost of £1.02billion. The Silver Pearl Hotel, designed by New York-based firm M. Castedo Architects, is set to have more than 1000 rooms and an adjoining expo centre, has been scheduled for completion ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup to be host by Qatar. Although it's still awaiting final approval, the remarkable-looking design featuring two 30-storey semi-circle towers will be built and operated by Qatari developer Katara Hospitality. Scroll down for video . The Silver Pearl Hotel features two half moon towers, each 30 storeys high, and will be built a mile off the coast of Doha . The £1.02billion development, pictured right, will be connected to the Qatari capital by a four-lane causeway . Between the structures will be a climate-controlled atrium over gardens with a view out to the surrounding ocean. Other buildings will include a conference and a roof deck above a multi-storey parking facility. A statement from the designer said the rooms and suites will showcase the country's 'rich cultural heritage and visual traditions' and include a number of restaurants and high-end retail commercial spaces. The stainless steel and glass exterior will be illuminated at night with LEDs to 'create an illusion of a shimmering pearl glowing in the sea,' the statement continued. The 1000-plus room hotel will have a stainless steel and glass exterior and light up like a pearl on the ocean at night . The estimated £1.02b cost doesn't include the interior construction or the building of dining areas and commercial outlets. A four-lane elevated causeway will be constructed for cars while private yacht and helicopters will also have easy access to the hotel. The designer said the complex will be positions above the seabed to have as little impact as possible on the marine environment. 'A major environmental consultant with extensive marine experience in the area will be responsible for making sure that lessons learned on existing projects such as The Palm and The World in nearby Dubai are incorporated in the development of this particular site,' the statement said. Doha is set to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup and is looking to dramatically expand its capacity for incoming tourism . The interiors will include a garden atrium (pictured) along with conference centres, restaurants and high-end retailers . The Silver Pearl is perhaps the most ambitious of a number of projects commissioned ahead of the 2022 World Cup by which the country is aiming to have increased its hotel capacity from about 15,000 to 95,000. A report by Samba Financial Group fears following the tournament, which has been shrouded in controversy with widespread accusations of corruption throughout the bidding process, the country's tourism intake will struggle to support so many hotel facilities. 'Although the recent growth of the tourism industry in Qatar has been robust, it will be difficult for the country to achieve the level of visitor growth which will garner enough demand to support a 400 per cent expansion in the number of hotel rooms in eight years,' the report stated.","The Silver Pearl Hotel has been designed by New York-based firm M.

"The brother of the Labour frontbencher forced to quit for sneering a white van van is today revealed to be a truck-driving builder. Islington MP Emily Thornberry was ousted by Ed Miliband after tweeting a photo of a white van outside a Rochester house draped in St George's flags, telling MailOnline that she had 'never seen anything like it'. Other Labour MPs accused her of being out of touch with Britain's working class, but it has now emerged her brother Ben, 50, has recently returned to England from America, where he worked in construction and drove two 'red trucks with tools in them'. Defence: Ben Thornberry (pictured), who works in the construction industry, said that his sister wasn't 'looking down her nose' at others when she posted the tweet of a family home draped in England flags . Ms Thornberry sparked a huge row last week while on the campaign trail in the Rochester by-election, and within hours was forced to resign as shadow attorney general. She posted the image of the house, belonging to Dan Ware, a cage-fighting car dealer who branded her a 'snob'. Critics noted that as a resident in upmarket North London, she had little idea about life outside her metropolitan bubble. Ms Thornberry told MailOnline: 'I was brought up in a council house and I've never seen anything like it.' But her brother Ben has spoken of how the property was like the one they grew up in as children. Speaking to the Islington Tribune, Mr Thornberry defended his sister, saying that there was no way she would be 'looking down her nose' at others. He insisted he did not think she was sneering at the property, and it was a refection of the way other people viewed white van drivers. Wearing a hi-vis jacket and drinking tea in a cafe, he revealed how he was a van driver himself. 'In America, I had two trucks with tools in. They were red, not white. From someone who is in the construction industry, and has been for many years in a foreign country, I cannot believe this wild reaction and how all these people are jumping on construed ideas.' Mr Miliband, the Labour leader, was mocked last week for claiming that when he saw a van all he thought was: 'Respect.' Resignation: Ms Thornberry, 54, (pictured) a close Ed Miliband ally and one of the first to back him as leader in his battle against brother David, stepped down from her post as Shadow Attorney General on November 20 . Ms Thornberry was one of the first to back Ed Miliband as leader in his battle against brother David. But Mr Miliband was said to have never been so angry when he saw Ms Thornberry's tweet, and her subsequent explanation that she had never seen anything like the house in Rochester. But Mr Thornberry brother said that the house she photographed 'looks like the one they grew up in' on a council estate outside Guildford, Surrey. He added: 'It says more about their own perception, and their real feelings, rather than the person who took a pic of a house that looks like the one they grew up in with their younger brother who works in the construction industry.' Mr Thornberry and his sister were raised by their mother, a teacher, on the Bellfields estate in Guildford, after their parents divorced and his father moved to New York to work for the United Nations. Mr Thornberry, who has recently returned to England after 26 years in America, works for a charity that gives disadvantaged young people a way into the construction industry. While in New York he worked as a builder and a freelance photojournalist. He argued that their background meant that it was 'in their genes' to help the 'poorest in society'. Controversial: Ms Thornberry posted this picture of a home in Rochester on Twitter. The MP for Islington South and Finsbury was  attacked for her subsequent comments  that she had 'never seen anything like it' Mocking: White van man Dan Ware owns the home that was photographed by Ms Thornberry. Mr Ware turned up at the MP's home in north London, England flag in hand (pictured, to demand an apology . Ms Thornberry, who lives in £3million Victorian townhouse, protested that she had become a victim of anti-Islington prejudice - an area that has become a by-word for champagne socialism. But Mr Miliband said he was ‘angry’ with Ms Thornberry because it gave the ‘that somehow Labour had the wrong view of that family’. He said: ‘It's not the view we have of that family. Labour's never had that view of disrespect and I'm afraid her tweet conveyed a sense of disrespect - that's not my view, that's not Labour's view, it's wrong, it never will be our view and that's why I think it was right she resigned.’ Asked what went through his mind when he saw a white van outside a house with England flags, Mr Miliband replied: ‘What goes through my mind is respect - respect is a basic rule of politics and I'm afraid her tweet conveyed a sense of disrespect.’ Humble beginnings: Mrs Thornberry, who lives with her husband in a Victorian townhouse in Islington, north London (pictured), grew up with her brother on a council estate outside Guildford, Surrey . The Islington South MP faced a barrage of criticism including from outraged Labour colleagues who accused her of being 'derogatory'. One senior Labour insider said it was 'worse than the Gillian Duffy moment' when Gordon Brown was recorded calling a voter a 'bigoted woman'. Labour MPs and senior frontbenchers began privately calling for Ms Thornberry to be ousted from the shadow Cabinet last night before Mr Miliband decided she had to go. Tory think tank chief David Skelton said it was an example of the 'outrageous snobbery of modern Labour. Sneering at working people.' Mr Ware, the owner of the house said Ms Thornberry 'should have asked me first' before taking the picture of his three-bedroom home, which he bought with wife Maria for £119,000 in 2002. The father of four said he had simply put up the three St George flags to celebrate the World Cup, and that it was 'not political'. Referring to Miss Thornberry, he said: 'She's a snob. What's she got, a three-storey townhouse in Islington? These flags can be found anywhere you look.' He works in the motor trade and does property maintenance. Born in 1960, Ms Thornberry, 54, is the daughter of the late Cedric Thornberry, who worked for 17 years as Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations and his wife Sallie, a teacher. Her parents divorced when Ms Thornberry was seven, and she and her brother, Ben, were raised by their mother, a former Labour Councillor and Mayor, on a council estate outside Guildford, Surrey. Having failed the 11-plus exam, Miss Thornberry attended a secondary-modern school and then the University of Kent in Canterbury. She joined the Labour party at 17, motivated, she said later, by her 'hard' and 'unfair' upbringing. She then joined the chambers of Michael Mansfield QC, the celebrity left wing barrister. The 54-year-old shadow attorney general was a human rights barrister before she was elected the MP for Islington South and Finsbury in 2005. Miss Thornberry and her High Court judge husband moved into the street, where homes are valued at up to £4.7milllion, in the same week as Tony and Cherie Blair, who lived there before moving to Downing Street. Shortly before winning her seat, it emerged the mother-of-three had sent her daughter to a selective school more than miles from her home and far outside her constituency. She refused to defend her decision describing it as a 'private' matter. And in 2007 it was revealed that, despite Ms Thornberry’s campaign for more social housing, her husband had bought a three-storey former housing association property for £500,000 and was renting it out to private tenants, some of them Labour activists. Once in Parliament, she allied herself with the Brownites against Tony Blair and also found time to be chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Cycling Group. When Gordon Brown entered Downing Street, she put her first foot on the ministerial ladder as an aide in the Climate Change department, where she worked under Ed Miliband. She was the first MP to nominate Mr Miliband to be Labour leader when he stood against his brother in 2010. Her loyalty was rewarded with a shadow ministerial post and in April 2011 she was appointed Shadow Attorney General.","Emily Thornberry posted a sneering tweet of family home draped in flags .

"Scientists have recreated a beer found on a ship that sank in 1842. The bottles had been 165ft (50 metres) underwater but were recovered in 2010. Now a Finnish brewery is planning to bring the replicated beer to market so punters can get a taste of the 19th century brew. Brewer Mats Ekholm from Finnish brewery Stallhagen samples beer during a press conference in Espoo, Finland. A Finnish brewery has reproduced a replica of a beer discovered on a shipwreck from 1842 in the Aland archipelago between Finland and Sweden . The beer was found on a shipwreck in the Aland archipelago between Finland and Sweden. Divers found 145 bottles of champagne and five beer bottles on the ship four years ago. Sailors enjoyed a tipple of gin 200 years ago, archaeologists have found. A stoneware bottle recovered from the wreckage of a sailing ship near Gdansk contains a sealed flask - and experts in August said it contains booze. Researchers found the vessel contains 14% alcohol, and it could be a type of gin. Details will be known after further studies. The bottle has been recovered from the wreck, which rests on the bottom of the Gulf, at a depth of 40ft (12 meters), approximately 2.5 miles (4km) east of Gdynia Orłowo. The remains of the ship were discovered last year, during a routine survey of the bottom, by the staff of the Maritime Office in Gdynia. University of Leuven's Brewing Technology Research Group were then asked to study and reconstruct the beer. Led by Professor Guido Aerts and Master Brewer Gert De Rouck, the team worked for a year to reconstruct the centuries-old brew. ‘Based on the micro-organisms in the bottles, we were able to figure out which type of yeast and bacteria were used by the beer’s nineteenth-century brewers,’ said De Rouck. ‘This information allowed us to trace the beer back to Belgium.’ The team says the beer is as close to the original as possible. One difference, though, is that malt was produced differently in the 19th century. This would have meant the beer back then was sweeter. The more recent version has a low bitterness and an alcohol content of 4.7 per cent.

In total the laboratory produced 1,500 litres of the beer, creating 1,700 bottles made of hand-blown glass, just like the original. Transporting beer in glass back in the day was unusual as most were transported in barrels, which makes the find somewhat exceptional. The beer will now be mass-produced and sold by Finnish brewery Stallhagen.

"A kayaker held his nerve to capture the moment a 20ft minke whale came within arm's reach beneath the water. Andrew Peacock, a doctor, was working on a three-week expedition on a yacht in the Antarctic Peninsula when he spotted the magnificent mammal gliding through the water below. Later, while kayaking, Dr Peacock got a closer look when the creature swam up to inspect the red-bottomed hull of his vessel. A 20ft minke whale glided under the kayak of doctor Andrew Peacock during an Antarctic expedition . Andrew Peacock captured the exact moment a 20ft minke whale passed underneath his kayak in Neko Harbour in the Antarctic Peninsula . Dr Peacock, seen in Paradise Harbour in the Antarctic Peninsula, had spotted the whale earlier from his expedition's yacht . The quick-thinking medic grabbed his Canon DSLR camera from a bag on his chest harness to preserve the memory on film. 'I was awestruck to be in such close proximity to such a beautiful, elegant ocean mammal,' Dr Peacock said. 'Being in a kayak made the encounter seem that much more personal. 'Initially I didn't trust that the whale could detect the exact boundaries of my kayak. 'I was certainly feeling vulnerable and quite nervous that I could end up in the freezing water.' The shots joined his collection of the icy scenery and wildlife from the Antarctic tour. Antarctic minke whales are not known for being particularly social, keeping to small groups of about two to four. The whale came close to the kayaks to inspect the colourful hulls, which was unusual behaviour for the breed . The doctor had a bag strapped to his chest harness with his camera equipment, allowing him to record sights from the view of his kayak . Despite weighing up to nine tonnes, . they are considered small by whale standards. They use their beaks poke . holes in the pack ice of the Antarctic. 'I took a simple but risky approach,' Dr Peacock said. 'With no waterproof protection for this expensive equipment I was as careful as possible.' The 45-year-old said he often combines his love for rock climbing, mountaineering and kayaking with his medical skills as a tour guide. The kayakers on the Henry Cookson Adventures expedition explored the peninsula on the freezing water . The whale pictures joined stunning shots from the kayak of Neko Harbour and Paradise Harbour, pictured, in the Antarctic Peninsula . The doctor, from Queensland, Australia, has practised medicine in ten countries and previously led kayak tours off the coast of San Francisco. He said: 'One has to accept that you're only really useful in case of an emergency. 'I enjoy expedition medical trips best when I can play another role.'","Andrew Peacock was working on an expedition in the Antarctic Peninsula .

"Its hull astonishingly intact, a First World War German U-boat lies embedded in remote mudflats up an English creek.While more than 40 of the deadly submarines met their fate in our waters during the conflict, this is the only one that can be seen. The wreckage of the others lies hidden deep beneath the sea. The existence of this one has long been known, but its eerie presence has gained fresh interest after tidal changes and the recent storms made it more visible. A World War One U-boat, believed UB-122, on mudflats near Humblebee Creek near the Isle of Grain . The U-boats of the Imperial German Navy very nearly won World War One for Germany . All that is left of the once deadly weapon is a crumbling rusted wreck of the submarine . The wreckage can still be seen beached in a remote area of mudflats on the banks of the River Medway in Hoo . New research by naval historians for . English Heritage has shed fresh light on how the undersea war machine . came to be marooned on the banks of the Medway in Hoo, Kent, and the . mystery of why it has lain there untouched for more than nine decades. Their investigations also led them to conclude that, after many years of . uncertainty about its identity, it is almost certainly a submarine . called UB-122. Yesterday . marine archaeologist Mark Dunkley, the maritime designation adviser for . English Heritage, said: ‘It has been there since 1921. It was one of . more than 100 U-boats which surrendered at the end of the war and were . taken to Harwich. ‘Some were sent to the French navy but most were cut up and used as scrap metal. ‘Records . show that the diesel engines were cut out of UB-122 and reused in a . cement works at Halling in Kent – the U-boat’s power plants thus . serviced Britain’s post-war industrial development. ‘What . we still don’t know is exactly why or how UB-122 ended where it is. It’s likely it was being taken up the Medway estuary to be broken up for . scrap. Perhaps in a storm it parted from its tow, the cable snapped, . and the prevailing winds blew it to Hoo. ‘As . to why it was left there, we can only speculate. It could have been too . much of an effort to get to it, or perhaps it was a problem of . navigation in how to get to it. ‘Its interest is that it is the only known complete U-boat that can be seen in British tidal waters.’ UB-122 . was a ‘coastal’ U-boat equipped with ten torpedoes and designed to . attack Allied shipping. The other main use of U-boats was for laying . mines. There are no current . plans to conserve it, but English Heritage is ‘looking to identify its . historic place in more detail’ after the end of next year’s . commemorations associated with the centenary of the start of the 1914 to . 1918 war. Mr Dunkley said: ‘It still serves as a poignant reminder of those who gave their lives at sea during the First World War.’ The submarine is thought to be a UB-I22 submarine and would have carried 10 torpedoes and were usually armed with a deck gun . They carried a crew of 34 and had a cruising range of 7,200-9,000 miles. Between 1916 and 1918, 96 were built . The U-boats of the Imperial German Navy very nearly won the Great War for Germany after the country heavily invested in the vessels . The U-boat skippers would target British vessels . On 5th September 1914, the U-boat SM U 21, which was considered unpromising initially, sank the British light cruiser HMS Pathfinder. In February 1915 the sea around the British isles were declared a war zone by Germany and the battle of the U-boats began. A neutral flag offered no protection against the ruthless U-boat captains, who were ordered to be absolutely sure a ship was neutral before sparing it. Submarines did not have a hopeful start in their history. The first submarine built in Germany was called the Brandtaucher, which sank during its first test dive. But bigger and more successful submarines were developed, and equipped with deadly weapons which made them a crucial addition to Germany's arsenal of weapons. At the start of World War I, Germany had twenty-nine U-boats; in the first ten weeks, five British cruisers had been lost to them. On 5 September 1914, HMS Pathfinder was sunk by SM U-21, the first ship to have been sunk by a submarine using a self-propelled torpedo. U-boats caused so much destruction that at one point during World War Two the British government thought that Britain would have to contemplate surrendering. Following the end of World War One, Germany was technically not allowed to have submarines or submarine crews - but continued to invest money, time and man power into building more as they prepared for World War Two.","It is the only German submarine visible in UK waters today and is a visible reminder of the Great War .

"ABC news correspondent Amy Robach has revealed that her cancer has spread to her lymph nodes. In a letter to fans published today, the 40-year-old journalist says that when receiving a double mastectomy earlier this month, doctors discovered a second, undetected malignant tumor. However, Ms Robach remains optimistic  saying that the cancer did not spread beyond her second sentinel node, and that while she 'will have more treatments ahead...' none of them will take her out of work. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Support: Amy Robach, her husband Andrew Shue and her daughters, Ava McIntosh and Annie McIntosh were seen heading to Madison Square Park after she announced live on air she has breast cancer - which has now spread to her second sentinel lymph node . Ms Robach's letter, which was posted to ABC's website, made her appear incredibly positive. 'It may be cold and gloomy outside today but it is warm and sunny in my world,' she said about her surgery's aftermath. Ms Robach says that 'physically and emotionally I have been through the ringer, but I am emerging on the other side so much stronger. I have a greater appreciation for life, for health and for how such simple acts of kindness can be so incredibly powerful.' Her cancer diagnosis, which she received two weeks ago after receiving an on-the-air mammogram to raise awareness for breast cancer, has given her a different outlook on life. 'I am looking through a different lens now…and I am thankful for that as well,' she wrote in the letter.  'There was my life before October 30th and now my life after.' Good Morning America anchor and fellow breast cancer survivor Robin Roberts has been in contact with Ms Robach. 'Amy is doing well, thank you for asking,' Ms Roberts told Closer at the Reeve Foundation Gala on Thursday night. She . continued, saying: 'Just how it all happened has us still reeling. But . she's home from the hospital, we've been talking with her, she's eager . to continue working as much as she can through the long process, but . she's in great spirits and the surgery went well and we can't wait to . have her back.' Breast cancer: Amy received an on-air mammogram on October 1 (pictured above), after realizing she is the age when she should be getting tested regularly but had been putting it off because she was busy with work and her family . Robach noted in her letter that she expects to return back to work on December 2 - a date that will not be altered by her ongoing treatments. Research by the Susan G. Komen Foundation says that women with 1-3 cancerous lymph nodes like Ms Roback show a five-year relative 87% survival rate . 'I couldn’t be more excited to get back to work,' she wrote. Robach, a mother of two, was given her shocking diagnosis after being asked by a GMA producer in September if she would take a mammogram live on air to raise awareness for breast cancer for their 'GMA Goes Pink' day. She reluctantly agreed - and it was a decision that saved her life. On October 1, in front of millions of people, Robach took her mammogram, breathing a sigh of relief when it was over. A few weeks later, she was asked to come back to the doctors and was so unconcerned, she didn't even bring anyone with her. 'I thought I was going back in for a . few follow-up images, only to find out in a matter of hours that I had . breast cancer,' Amy wrote on her ABC blog. Ms Robach wrote today that she 'got very lucky finding the cancer through our ABC sponsored mammogram and I got lucky choosing an aggressive approach.' Sad news: Amy Robach, 40, announced on GMA that she has breast cancer and needed to undergo a double mastectomy . That same mommogram not only detected Ms Robach's breast cancer, but the second undetected tumor that 'no MRI, no mammogram, no sonogram had found…it was only through the mastectomy that [my doctor] discovered it,' she wrote. She spoke on GMA last week about . the experience and how it has affected her and her family. 'Robin Roberts and ABC saved my life by telling me to go into that van for a mammogram' 'Robin Roberts and ABC saved my life by telling me to go into that van for a mammogram,' she said. 'I'm 40 and I had been putting it off for a number of years - between flying all over the world for work and running around with my kids to school, ballet and gymnastics.

"A list of the worst mobile phone apps for extracting personal information such as location and contacts has been compiled by academics. Among the worst for taking details from users who have little or no idea it is happening include Angry Birds and Brightest Flashlight. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh in the US, looked at the most popular programs in Google's Android app store to compile their list. Researchers found that users often have little idea their apps take details such as location. Some of the apps, such as Google Maps, were at least half expected by mobile users to be taking location details but others were more of a surprise. When told that the Angry Birds mobile app took location details, 80 per cent of users questioned were surprised. Dr Jason Hong, of the university’s Human-Computer Interaction Institute, wrote on a blog: ""A vast majority of people (95%) were surprised that Brightest Flashlight used location data, but no one (0%) was surprised that Google Maps did so. 'Here, we can use level of surprise as one form of privacy. If people aren't surprised, then from our perspective it's less of a privacy issue, since people have some level of informed consent. 'On the other hand, if lots of people are surprised, then we have a potential privacy issue at hand.' The list, which was not ranked in any order, was released after Dr Hong and colleague including Professor Norman Sadeh analysed the 100 most popular Android apps. The other eight apps were Toss It game, Talking Tom virtual pet, Backgrounds HD Wallpapers, Dictionary.com, Mouse Trap game, Horoscope, Shazam music, and Pandora Internet Radio. One or more of three types of information - location, device identifying details, and contact lists - were collected, the researchers found. Users were often in the dark as to why the information was collected by the app, such as 58 per cent being unaware device IDs could be used for marketing. Dr Hong said users would be far less suspicious if they were to be told why the information is being extracted as there can be good reasons for it. The mobile Angry Birds app was among those named by researchers. Backgrounds HD Wallpapers takes contact details because because it has a facility to change the appearance of the screen when one of the contacts rings or texts. He said it is important that the apps are transparent about what they take and why. He added: 'Some of these uses, while rated unusual, were actually perceived as legitimate once it was explained how the data was used. 'For example, the Dictionary.com app uses location for finding words that others near you are searching for, rather than for ads or other purposes. 'In our work, we also found that people were generally ok with this usage once it was made clear to them. 'In the short-term, the main thrust of our research is to help people understand these kinds of unusual behaviors of apps, as well as increase transparency. 'It's worth pointing out too that a lot of this information seems to be used for advertising rather than malicious purposes (though it obviously depends on your definition of malicious). 'In the long-term, we need better policies and best practices around this kind of data collection, as well as better ways of helping developers create sustainable business models that also respect privacy. Professor Sadeh was quoted by NBCNEWS.com as saying: ‘When you look at the fundamental issue, it's about informing users and giving them an option. ‘You need to say more to users than, “I need permission to collect this.” You need to tell them what you will do with what you collect. When you communicate, you put people at ease.’ But he added: ‘The platforms invite developers to collect more information than you would like. ‘And the developers can hide behind what the app store offers (for disclosure options). 'They can say, “Hey, there's no way for me to offer more.” It's up to these marketplaces to make an effort to convey more information.’","Astonishment at realisation a flashlight app extracts location information .

"Not content with journeying to remote lands, Google Street View has now decided to go underwater. Using scooters with specially-designed cameras, divers are currently documenting sea life from the bottom of Sydney Harbour as well as the waters of Bondi and Manly beaches. The images, created with the help of Catlin Seaview Survey, could provide scientists with information about how the harbour is changing and reveal the incredible marine life beneath the surface to its one billion viewers. Scroll down for video . Over the next eight months, Google will collect images for a launch at the World Parks Congress being held in Sydney this November . To create the amazing underwater images, Google and the Caitlin survey developed the first ever . tablet-operated underwater cameras. Complete with their own propulsion system, the images are captured through a spherical camera housing that allows continuous high-resolution, 360-degree  imagery to be collected as divers steer through the reefs. On a typical run it will capture over 1000 panoramas, which are then stitched together to produce a virtual dive experience. So far ship wrecks, pink boulders, bull sharks, bright green kelp beds and discarded bathtubs have all been uncovered as part of Google’s adventures in Sydney. ‘We tend to think of the harbour as a monolithic and flat surface, but people will be blown away by what is happening underneath,’ Professor Emma Johnston, from the Sydney Institute of Marine Science told IBT Times. ‘The amazing kelp forests, underwater gardens of sea tulips and sponges and fish that they have never seen.

"Retailer John Lewis has refused to help a campaign to save orphaned penguins, despite their successful Christmas TV advert being based on the animals. Earlier this month, Bristol Zoological Society launched an appeal to raise £20,000 for their centre in South Africa to help care for the chicks, which had been abandoned by their parents. The centre had come under increasing financial pressure due to the number of young penguins having to be cared for and the rise in fish prices. Scroll down for video . The zoo decided to ask the retailer for help in light of their highly successful Christmas ad, which tells the story of a young boy who finds a companion for his lonely penguin, Monty . The charity has come under increasing financial pressure due to the number of chicks having to be cared for and the rise in fish prices . As part of the appeal, the zoo decided to ask the retailer for a donation in light of their highly successful Christmas commercial. It tells the story of a young boy who realises his lonely Adelie penguin, Monty, is longing for a penguin companion. And so on Christmas morning, the boy surprises Monty with the gift of a new penguin friend named Mabel. But despite John Lewis wishing them luck, they said they were unable to help with their campaign as they had already partnered with wildlife conservation charity WWF to support and help protect the habitat of the Adelie penguin. A spokeswoman for the zoo said: 'As a wildlife conservation charity, we decided to launch a public appeal for starving penguin chicks in South Africa. 'In view of the enormous impact of their Christmas penguin advert, we approached John Lewis to ask them to support our project in the wild; either through helping us to spread the word via their online channels or through financial support. 'We were disappointed to learn that they felt they couldn't contribute neither to help save these endangered creatures.

Two of the orphaned penguins, who were abandoned and then rescued by a project led by Bristol Zoological Society. The charity is hoping to raise £20,000 to help care for them . Bristol Zoological Society say they were disappointed that John Lewis felt they couldn't help their appeal for the penguins . 'However, we are delighted that many members of the public are supporting this appeal, and remain hopeful that the generosity of the human spirit ensures that the chicks don't go hungry this Christmas.' A spokeswoman for John Lewis explained that they receive many enquiries asking them to support charitable causes and it is unfortunate they cannot fulfil every request. She said: 'We receive a high number of charitable requests throughout the year and we are unfortunately unable to support all of these. 'This year for our Christmas advertising campaign we have partnered with WWF and all profit from the CD sales of the Christmas advert single, Real Love, is going towards their Adopt a Penguin programme. 'Since the campaign launched on November 6, along with WWF’s own penguin adoption Christmas activity, WWF has sent out over 2,000 adoptions for Adélie penguins, an increase of over 600 per cent from this time last year. 'We passed our apologies to Bristol Zoo that we are unable to help on this occasion and wish them the best of luck with their campaign.' Bristol Zoological Society set up and runs the charity SANCCOB, which takes in African penguin chicks, which have been abandoned by the parents. More than 430 African penguins are being cared for by the charity after being abandoned by their parents . One of the African penguins is weighed by the staff at the centre in South Africa. There are now fewer than 18,000 breeding pairs left in the wild off the coast of South Africa and Namibia . The bird's population fell by 70 per cent between 2001 and 2013 and there are fewer than 18,000 breeding pairs left in the wild off the South African and Namibian coast. The charity says that this year, the chicks are coming in early and in their hundreds from the colonies and that they are already helping to care for more than 430 birds. Staff at the society said the price of fish has sky-rocketed this season and an extra £20,000 is needed before Christmas or they will have to stop taking in animals. Dr Christoph Schwitzer, Director of Conservation at Bristol Zoological Society said: 'Unless conservation organisations intervene, these chicks will starve to death. 'As African penguin populations are currently facing a crisis due to a diminished food supply near their nesting colonies, there is a substantial risk that this species could eventually become extinct without action.' Numerous penguin chicks are abandoned around this time of year, just before their parents start their moulting cycle, when they develop a new set of waterproof feathers. Adult African penguins still need to make foraging trips during this time and leave their chicks behind.","Bristol Zoo has launched a campaign to help save abandoned penguins .

"In one picture she is shown beaming with happiness as she receives a kiss from a guest on her wedding day. In another, she adopts a sultry pose in an evening dress, with her blonde curls tumbling over her shoulder. These family snapshots of Colonel Gaddafi’s daughter Aisha were among several unearthed by rebels at the dictator’s former headquarters in Tripoli. Bride: Aisha Gaddafi at her wedding. She is now thought to be in Algeria . Sultry: Aisha posing in an evening dress . Delivery: Aisha Gaddafi, pictured rousing Gaddafi supporters in March, has reportedly had a baby girl in Algeria . Birth: Aisha Gaddafi (left) had a baby girl shortly after arriving in Algeria with other members of her family including brother Hannibal (right) Yesterday it was reported that she had given birth within hours of escaping to Algeria with other members of her family. The 35-year-old lawyer, nicknamed the . ‘Claudia Schiffer of North Africa’ because of her bleached blonde hair . and European education, had a baby girl after evading rebel forces in . her home country. The revelation came as Algeria defended its decision to let members of the tyrant’s family into the country. Luxury lifestyle: Children jump into the swimming pool at Aisha Gaddafi's home inside her father's compound in Tripoli . Tacky: A rebel fighter poses on a golden couch shaped like a mermaid with the face of Aisha Gaddafi inside the family's Tripoli mansion . As well as his pregnant daughter, Gaddafi’s wife Safia and sons Hannibal and Muhammad are also in Algeria. Algeria said it had no option but to . give refuge to the family and said it was a ‘holy rule of hospitality’ to take in those in need of help. But Algeria sought to head off any . more criticism by closing its southern border with Libya and saying it . would not allow Colonel Gaddafi and his other sons into their country. Parted by the war? Colonel Gaddafi and his wife Safiya, who has fled across the border to neighbouring Algeria . Where is he? The departure of his family has led to questions that the ousted tyrant may have also fled to Algeria . If they did manage to get into . Algeria, they would be handed to the International Criminal Court, the . government in Algiers said. Gaddafi is wanted on several charges by the . ICC for crimes against humanity. Earlier, Libyan rebels had acted with fury at news the family had fled to Algeria. The government-in-waiting, the . National Transitional Council, described the harbouring of the Gaddafis . as ‘an aggressive act against the Libyan people’s wish’. The Gaddafis arrived with a posse of . bodyguards in six armoured Mercedes on Monday. All of their respective . partners and other children were also with them. The convoy is said to have crossed . the border at the south-western Libyan town of Ghadames, and then begun . heading towards Algiers, the Algerian capital. An Algerian government official said: . ‘Aisha gave birth very early this morning without medical equipment. She had a little girl. Mother and daughter are both doing very well.’ Aisha is Gaddafi’s only biological . daughter, and spoke out in support of her father throughout the civil . war. ‘He is my remedy against pain and my fortress against grief,’ she . said. Aisha also spoke up for Saddam . Hussein following the Iraq War. ‘When you have an occupying army coming . from abroad, raping your women and killing your own people, it is only . legitimate that you fight them,’ she said at the time. In 2006 she married her cousin Ahmed . al-Gaddafi al-Qahsi, an army colonel with whom she had three children. According to the Gaddafis, Qahsi was killed during the bombing of . Gaddafi’s compound on July 26, which means that Aisha will be a single . mother. Algeria has not yet recognised the NTC, and none of its extradition treaties applies to Libya. Algerian foreign minister Amar Belan . said in a statement that his country had adhered to a policy of ‘strict . neutrality’ throughout the Libya crisis and respects ‘the decision of . every person under its sovereignty’. He added that Algeria has no intention to ‘interfere in any manner whatsoever in the internal affairs’ of Libya.","Algerian foreign ministry confirm family have arrived .

Pat down: A police officer searches an immigrant before he takes him back into the camp . In the dune area of Calais, a small piece of land near the Channel Tunnel which is home to up to 2,000 migrants, violent clashes between rival ethnic groups have become an everyday occurrence. Eritreans and Ethiopians fighting over various routes into the ferry port appeared to be the principal reason for the fights, a police spokesman said. It is thought that rows with people-smugglers who charge up to £1,000 cash for passage to Britain have also contributed to the trouble. Yesterday, one Ethiopian man, who asked not to be named, said that Eritrean people smugglers were charging money for access to coveted areas for sneaking aboard lorries. Eritreans and Ethiopians fighting over various routes into the ferry port appeared to be the principal reason for the fights, a police spokesman said . It is thought that rows with people-smugglers who charge up to £1,000 cash for passage to Britain have also contributed to the trouble . After winning control of the situation, riot police went through the motions and frisked the young men, who are mostly in their 20s, recovering various knives, sticks and rocks . ‘They are trying to charge us 500 euro (£395) to get on a lorry and they will not let us wait in the good areas where the lorries are parked,’ he said. ‘It is not fair that one group of people get access and another don’t. They cannot keep it to themselves.’ After winning control of the situation, riot police went through the motions and frisked the young men, who are mostly in their 20s, recovering various knives, sticks and rocks. The situation is becoming unbearable for local police who say that they are stretched to breaking point by the constant fights. They have demanded live ammunition rather than rubber bullets to defend themselves against the migrant gangs who they claim are becoming increasingly ‘violent’. Last summer, violent clashes between Eritrean and Sudanese migrants led to more than 70 people being injured . Officers confirmed it was not normal practice to round up migrants. Few have any papers and trying to process them over and over again becomes pointless . Yesterday’s clash involved at least 200 young men. ‘We struggled for six hours to stop them fighting last night [Monday] and today there are more disturbances,’ said police union spokesman Gilles Debove. He said that ten injured youths were taken to hospital. Last summer, violent clashes between Eritrean and Sudanese migrants led to more than 70 people being injured. Gangs of young men fought running battles with police who fired tear gas and brandished shields and batons in an attempt to disperse them. The disagreement was again over access to prized areas where it is easier to board lorries. Riot: Yesterday’s clash involved at least 200 young men and took six hours to get under control . There was just one arrest yesterday. Officers confirmed it was not normal practice to round up migrants. Few have any papers and trying to process them over and over again becomes pointless. The migrants will also conceal their identities because any asylum applications they make in Britain will be harmed because they did not attempt to claim asylum in France. Just hours after the clash a 16-year-old Ethiopian girl was knocked over and killed on a busy Calais road yesterday as she tried to board a lorry to Britain. Her death is the third in as many weeks and highlights the increasingly desperate plight of migrants who are willing risk their lives to cross the Channel. The girl, named in camps as ‘Saba’, had made the perilous journey from Africa without her family and is believed to have been in Calais for several weeks. The car that killed her was heading for Calais from Dunkirk and swerved to avoid a group of migrants ‘in what appeared to be a tragic accident’, said a police spokesman. No charges are likely. Saba suffered internal injuries and died within a few hours of arriving in hospital. A police spokesman said: ‘Incidents of migrants running along major roads are very common. The migrants put themselves in huge danger all the time.’","French police pictured breaking up fights between rival groups .

"A New Jersey man accused of grooming a 14-year-old New Mexico girl online before driving to her Albuquerque home and leaving town with her for more than two weeks has appeared in court. Robert Joseph Butler, 26, is charged with one count of transporting a minor with the intent to engage in sexual activity. Butler had been communicating with the girl via social media and text messages for more than a year before making arrangements to meet her at her home in Albuquerque on March 31. On the lam: Robert Butler drove from New Jersey to New Mexico and went on the run with a teenaged girl for more than two weeks . The pair then left together and were missing for more than two weeks before police tracked them down on Thursday in Fort Smith, Arkansas, nearly 900 miles away. Police issued an Amber Alert for the girl after they found surveillance video of her getting into a car with Butler. According to KRQE, Butler stole a Subaru in Pennsylvania and spray-painted it white. The pair had also dyed their hair to avoid detection, and were living out of the car and in the woods. In the two-and-a-half weeks she was missing, the girl was taken to Oklahoma City, Texas and Arkansas by Butler. 'This has been an ongoing, intense investigation for the last 15 days,' supervisory deputy Tony Overstreet told the Times Record. 'The only lead that we had popped up here in Fort Smith, and we’ve been working it since Monday night.' Internet infatuation: Butler and his teenaged victim were allegedly living out of a stolen car in the woods before police swooped on them in a Target parking lot . Police finally caught up with the pair in a Target parking lot on April 17 after spotting a car matching the description of the one stolen in Pennsylvania and seeing the two return to the car from the store. 'It was just like a dream come true but, it was almost too good to be real because we had so many great leads that the marshals, the FBI, everybody was working on and then nothing would become of it,' the girl's father told KRQE. According to a press release, police believe that during their travels, the teen and Butler engaged in sexual activity. Butler was extradited to New Mexico and appeared in court Thursday. 'Crimes against children remain among the highest priorities for our office.  We are dedicated to doing all we can to identify and prosecute those who commit federal crimes targeting children, including those who seek to contact children over the internet for sexual purposes and then actually transport a minor to further that conduct, as is alleged in this case. 'We must do all we can to keep our communities and our children safe from these horrific crimes,' U. S. Attorney Conner Eldridge said Thursday.","Robert Joseph Butler, 26, from New Jersey allegedly met 14-year-old New Mexico girl Lacey DeWent online in 2013 .

"Hot: Supermodel Heidi Klum in the dress which sparked the joke from comedian Joan Rivers. She said: 'The last time a German looked this hot was when they were pushing Jews into ovens' Joan Rivers has been blasted by a Jewish pressure group for a joke she made about German supermodel Heidi Klum's daring Oscars outfit. 'The last time a German looked this hot was when they were pushing Jews into the ovens', said the 79-year-old - herself Jewish - before doubling over with laughter. The veteran comedian made the comment . about the Holocaust on Monday's Fashion Police show on E! when reviewing . the low-cut shimmering gold dress worn by the German beauty to attend Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Awards Viewing Party in West Hollywood. The joke has attracted the wrath of the Anti-Defamation League, an organisation that combats antisemitism, and says Rivers has trivialised an horrific event. ADL leader Abraham Foxman said: 'Of all people, Joan Rivers should know better. This remark is so vulgar and offensive to Jews and Holocaust survivors, and indeed to all Americans, that we cannot believe it made it to the airwaves. 'Making it worse, not one of her co-hosts made any effort to respond or to condemn this hideous statement, leaving it hanging out there and giving it added legitimacy through their silence. 'Almost as bad as her original comment is the fact that she sat there doubled over with laughter after saying it.' He continued: 'There are certain things about the Holocaust that should be taboo. This is especially true for Jews, for whom the Holocaust is still a deeply painful memory. 'It is vulgar and offensive for anybody to use the death of six million Jews and millions of others in the Holocaust to make a joke, but this is especially true for someone who is Jewish and who proudly and publicly wears her Jewishness on her sleeve.' Rivers has refused to apologise, claiming her her humour help to keeps the Holocaust in the public consciousness. She said: 'My husband lost the . majority of his family at Auschwitz, and I can assure you that I have . always made it a point to remind people of the Holocaust through humor.' Joan's husband, Edgar Rosenberg, was born in Germany but his family emigrated to Denmark and then South Africa in order to escape the Nazis. They married in 1965 after he hired her to work with him on a screenplay. He committed suicide by overdosing on prescription drugs in 1987. Scroll down for video . Rivers, who is Jewish, says her humour helps remind people about the Holocaust . Joan Rivers poses with her husband Edgar Rosenberg and daughter Melissa. He died in 1987 . New York Times best-selling thriller writer Joel C. Rosenberg, called the outburst 'disgusting', before tweeting '@Joan_Rivers should apologize to Jews and victims of the Holocaust. This is nothing to be joked about'. He later added'@Joan_Rivers should apologize to @HeidiKlum and the German people immediately. That was a terrible, reprehensible thing to say.' Blogger Laurdoone was equally scathing, tweeting: 'Why are we blasting Joan Rivers for her bad jokes when her bad plastic surgery is much much worse?' The . comedian has fallen foul of the ADL in the past. Last year, when . protesting Costco’s decision not to carry her book 'I Hate . Everything...Starting With Me', she compared the retailers to Nazi . Germany. Rage: The ADL described her joke as 'hideous', 'vulgar' and 'offensive' and demanded an apology . Heidi Klum at the 21st Annual Elton John AIDS Foundation's Oscar Viewing Party. On the right she is pictured with the British superstar . 'Germany is where banning books started, and it can start here just as quickly,' she said at the time. After she was criticised, she responded: 'Don’t talk to me about the Holocaust!' Yesterday Rivers was criticised for . mocking British singer Adele's weight on The David Letterman Show after . she met her at the ceremony. She said: 'She was very scared because she . sang at the awards,' Rivers explained. '(She said) ""My throat, my . throat, I don’t know if I can swallow!"" 'I said, ""Oh, yeah — you can swallow!""' Klum has not issued a statement about the joke. Horror: The entrance to Auschwitz concentration camp. Rivers says her husband lost many of his family there . In her book, Rivers quips about Whitney Houston's tragic death: 'I hate Houston. It’s crawling with bugs. Oh, wait, that’s Whitney Houston; I’m sorry, my bad. (Can I just mention that Whitney looked fabulous at the Grammys? She was in mahogany from head to toe.)' The comedy legend once ditched a joke, comparing First Lady Michelle Obama to Jackie Onassis, from her stand-up routine over racism fears. Recalling the wisecrack to DJ Howard Stern, the comedy legend said: 'We used to have Jackie O now we have Blackie O!' In 2004 she stunned New Yorkers, still raw from 9/11, when she mocked reports the CITIGROUP building in Manhattan was a terrorist target. Rivers said: 'I hope it goes down. It's so ugly. I'm helping them load them (bombs) in.' Last years she sparked a royal row with a sick joke about the death of Princess Diana, also on Fashion Police. The comedian advised the Duchess of Cambridge 'If you ever want to go to Paris, fly, don't take the tunnel.' As well as mocking singer Adele for her weight, she also made fun of Christina Aguilera, calling her 'fatso' and joking that she once came over to her table in a restaurant and said: 'You gonna finish that?'","Veteran comedian made comment on E! fashion show .

"Sky is set to launch a download service it claims could make the morning commute far more enjoyable. The Sky Go Extra service, which launches next week, will allow people to download films and TV show to their phone or tablet. It puts Sky in direct competition with Apple's iTunes services, and Google's Play store. The broadcaster said it expects the Sky Go Extra to be popular with commuters . The download service is an addition to Sky's Go app. Users simply find the programmes or film they want, and click the download button. It is then available on their device for 30 days, whether they have an internet connection or not. Set to launch this week, the service . will offer the 'majority' of Sky's catalogue, and will cost £5 a month . for users of the firm's apps. Blockbusters such as Avengers Assemble, Sherlock Holmes: Game of Shadows and Pirates In An Adventure with Scientists will all be available for download through the service, alongside the entire James Bond film catalogue, containing all twenty-two official Bond films. Luke Bradley-Jones of Sky admitted the firm had been taken aback by the popularity of its Sky Go service, which allows people to watch its content on their phones and tablets. 'There has been a massive shift in behaviour from consumers due to content on demand,' he said. 'It's comparable to the introduction of live pause and rewind. 'We're connecting our customer's boxes to the internet, and consumption habits shift dramatically - and it's not all driven by the juggernaut of iPlayer, it shifts the shape of people's viewing habits. 'Being connected drives extra value for us customers, and really help people watch whenever they want - this is really the final piece of the puzzle.' Sky also revealed what its customers are watching on 'catchup' - with Game of thrones being the most popular and 'boxsets' Using the new service, people can also choose to download either standard or high definition versions, and once downloaded, they have 30 days to watch. 'People can download their favourite TV shows and movies, and watch them offline where they don't have a 3G or wifi connection,' he said. Sky believes the service will offer better value for money that services such as Apple's iTunes, which charges users for every item they download - although users do then 'own' the content, compared to Sky's subscription model. 'People spend a lot of money buying content through iTunes and other places to watch when they commute or are on a plane, so we think this is good value,' said Mr Bradley-Jones. The new app will run on iPads, iPhones and selected Android devices . The new service allows people to download as many films and shows as they can fit on their device .","Sky Go Extra allows users to download TV shows and movies to watch when they don't have an internet connection .

"An elderly woman has died after a car without a driver rolled down a hill and knocked her over - before the owner retrieved the vehicle and accidentally ran over her again. Lee Sheila Mahoney, 73, was walking outside her home in Edgewater, Maryland on Monday afternoon when a car that did not have its parking brake secured drifted towards her. The 2010 Ford Mustang struck Mahoney and came to a stop on top of her, the Anne Arundel County Police Department said in a press release. The owner of the car, 23-year-old David Adam Garman, was in a nearby home when he saw the car rolling down the street, which has a gentle incline. Tragic loss: Lee Mahoney, pictured, was walking . along her Edgewater, Maryland street when she was knocked over and . killed by a driverless car on Monday.

One relative said: 'She was the heart and soul of our family', while her sister Elaine Ritchey, added: 'God I just want to pick up the phone and call her and better yet, tell her again how much I love her.' Police said the preliminary cause of the crash is driver error. 'The driver failed park the vehicle with its wheels turned properly towards the curb with the parking brake set,' Anne Arundel County Police spokesman Justin Mulcahy said. It is unclear if Garman could face charges. Authorities said the investigation is ongoing and being conducted by members of the Traffic Safety Section.

"Andrew Miller MP, pictured, warned that the terms and conditions on Facebook and Twitter were 'indecipherable' and required a 'US law degree' Social media firms such as Facebook and Twitter should have to display ‘health warnings’ for their small print, a group of MPs has demanded. The Commons Science and Technology Committee warns in a report today that you would need a law degree to understand the terms and conditions used by most companies. Millions of people sign away control of their private information and pictures because they do not understand how their data might be used, the committee says. It calls for social media groups to display much simplified notices on their websites - comparing them to the health warnings on cigarette packets. Andrew Miller MP, the committee’s chairman, said the terms and conditions that users agree to are indecipherable. He said nobody really knows how their information is used - because nobody can understand the documents. The problem, he said, is that they are designed for civil cases in US courts, not normal people. ‘Let’s face it, most people click yes to terms and conditions contracts without reading them, because they are often laughably long and written in the kind of legalese you need a law degree from the US to understand,’ he said. The information we put online can be invaluable to advertisers, enabling them to target their desired market more accurately than ever before. The GPS trackers on our phones track our movements and the videos and photographs we take give a window into our private worlds. Under data protection laws the companies have to obtain our ‘informed consent’ before using this information. But MPs fear that we are not truly ‘informed’ when we click a button to give our consent – because we do not understand the rules. The way technology companies use our data is unclear and the committee wants the Government to draw up new laws to bind them to a code of conduct. That would involve telling users exactly how their data might be used - in very simple and concise terms - before they sign up to use a service. A powerful Commons committee described the terms and conditions of social media sites as 'indecipherable' The report says: ‘Clear communication with the public has been achieved in the past, for example in the use of graphic health warnings on cigarette packets. ‘Effective communication with the public can be achieved again.’ It adds: ‘Millions of individuals from across the globe have signed up to social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, and this phenomena has led to vast collections of personal data. ‘We have not been convinced that the users of social media platforms are fully aware of how their data might be used and what redress they may, or may not have if they disagree with how an organisation exploits that data. ‘This is exacerbated by our finding that terms and conditions contracts are simply too long and complex for any reasonable person to make any real sense of. Reading such documents has been likened to engaging with “Shakespeare”. ‘Drafted by lawyers, to be used in American court rooms, the contents of terms and conditions have been designed to protect organisations in the event of legal action. ‘As a mechanism for showing that users have provided informed consent, so that organisations can process incredibly persona data, terms and conditions contracts are simply not fit for purpose.’ The MPs are also critical of the Government’s own record on data protection. They cite the disastrous NHS plan to harvest patients’ medical data to improve services - a programme that has been delayed over privacy fears. The report said users are not 'informed' when they click their consent as they do not understand the rules . The committee demands that the Government gets its own house in order and improves data transparency, before it can turn its attention to pushing through a new set of guidelines for social media firms. Mr Miller said: ‘Socially responsible companies wouldn’t want to bamboozle their users, of course, so we are sure most social media developers will be happy to sign up to the new guidelines on clear communication and informed consent that we are asking the Government to draw up. ‘I hope that a voluntary system of guidelines can work, because, if not, legislation might be needed.’ Facebook last night said it had recently simplified its terms and conditions. In submissions to the committee in August, Facebook insisted it took data protection seriously. ‘We devote the necessary resources to ensure we meet our data protection obligations,’ the firm wrote. ‘This includes having a dedicated data protection team that brings together expertise from legal, policy, platform, law enforcement, security, engineering and community operations.’ Twitter said its privacy policy was just four pages and 2,000 words in length. It added ‘Twitter continually strives to ensure the right balance between providing adequate information whilst also ensuring it is approachable and user friendly.’ The LinkedIn Corporation said: ‘Our members use LinkedIn because they trust it with their professional reputation. We recognize that this trust is earned by both respecting our members’ privacy and properly protecting their personal information.’","Commons Science and Technology Committee investigated social media .

Angela Siler-Fisher also allegedly phoned the other woman, Marcelle Mallery, threatening to 'beat her f***ing a** wh***' and 'dislocate her vagina' and then proceeded to send her 25 text messages over the next 16 hours, including one with a photo of her bedroom.

"CCTV images show the moment masked robbers took a west London boutique by storm - before disappearing with more than £150,000 in designer handbags. Shoppers cowered in fear when a pair of raiders burst into the Designer Exchange in Knightsbridge yesterday in a targeted robbery in broad daylight. The audacious raid has sparked anger in the exclusive shopping district, with the store's managing director branding the police response 'lacklustre' and calling officers 'deflated' and 'broken'. Scroll down for video . Shoppers grab one another in fear as masked raiders steal from the Designer Exchange boutique in London's Knightsbridge yesterday . The gang entered the store in broad daylight before making off with more than £150,000 of designer handbags . Shop boss Dominic Durante said Kensington and Chelsea needs police officers patrolling the streets in marked vehicles and suggested design giant Chanel might make 'a large contribution'. In a statement about the incident, Mr Durante said: 'Eventually the police arrived, lacklustre and broken. This was not a force to be reckoned with, this was a deflated, beaten, disillusioned sorry lot who had seen it all before and were helpless to do anything about it.' He went on: 'We and all the other stores in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea can continue to put up barriers to protect our staff, customers and goods, hire security guards and install locked, bullet-proof cabinets. 'We can continue to expect desperate people to take what they can't afford or take advantage of opportunities that currently are so available. Two men entered the store at 4.30pm before stealing more than 20 Chanel, Hermes, Birkin and Kelly handbags . Staff pressed a panic button during the robbery, in which the store's smoke alarm was also activated . 'Or we could think outside the box and tell retailers to open their doors and feel free to allow the world to see, touch and buy freely without risk because everyone knows that the police are outside to ensure law and order. 'Simply, we need numbers, bobbies patrolling and marked vehicles circulating. Store owner Dominic Durante has criticised the police over the raid, branding their response 'lacklustre' and 'deflated' 'Every other minute a police presence should be around. There should be no need for shutters or alarms because everyone will know that only a crazy fool would take the chance. 'Protect this very special square mile. Us retailers would be happy to pay for the extra police presence. I'm pretty sure Chanel would make a large contribution to start the ball rolling.' His scathing attack came after Scotland Yard said police in the area were appealing for information and witnesses following the raid in Egerton Terrace at 4.30pm. It is claimed two unarmed masked men entered the store and seized a number of high-value handbags before making off in a dark-coloured vehicle. No arrests have been made and no one was injured. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police responded to the criticism today, insisting officers do patrol the area. He said: 'Officers attended the Designer Exchange in Egerton Terrace within six minutes of the initial call to police. 'Unfortunately, the suspects made off prior to police arriving. Four officers and a sergeant were initially assigned to the call and attended the scene. A search of the local area was conducted. 'Two scene of crime officers and a detective constable attended to take forensic samples, witness statements and initiate a thorough and detailed investigation within two hours of the crime taking place. 'Officers from Kensington and Chelsea do patrol the area with officers assigned to locations based on intelligence gathered from local communities and predictive crime pattern analysis.' The store's owner said shops are like sitting ducks due to the lack of police patrols in the area . Photographs shared on the store's instagram page feature bags by designers including Chanel, Christian Louboutin, Yves Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen . On the Designer Exchange website, it says: 'We love designer handbags. We aim to revolutionise this second-hand industry and want to give our customers a better way to buy, sell and exchange. 'We guarantee all our handbags and accessories are authentic as it is vital to give our customers peace of mind when paying for such high-value items.'

"One of the two hydrogen bombs that landed when a B-52 bomber broke up over Goldsboro, North Carolina in 1961 . New details have emerged about the near fatal 1961 Goldsboro B-52 crash and how close one of the hydrogen bombs came to exploding after it crash landed. The B-52 bomber broke up in the sky over North Carolina during a routine flight just three days after President John F. Kennedy’s inauguration on January 20. According to a newly declassified report published on Monday by the National Security Archive, one of the bombs  - which landed in free-fall and without the help of its parachute - was actually in the ‘armed’ setting by the time it hit the ground near Goldsboro. If the shock of crash-landing had not also damaged the switch contacts, the weapon could have detonated, the report said. ‘The report implied that because Weapon 2 landed in a free-fall, without the parachute operating, the timer did not initiate the bomb’s high voltage battery (‘trajectory arming’), a step in the arming sequence,’ wrote Bill Burr of the National Security Archives. ‘For Weapon 2, the Arm/Safe switch was in the ""safe"" position, yet it was virtually armed because the impact shock had rotated the indicator drum to the ""armed"" position. But the shock also damaged the switch contacts, which had to be intact for the weapon to detonate.' Burr concluded: ‘Perhaps this is what Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara had in mind, a few years later, when he observed that, “by the slightest margin of chance, literally the failure of two wires to cross, a nuclear explosion was averted.’” The blasts from the Mark 39 bombs - each one 260 times the power of the explosive that was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, in the Second World War - would have killed thousands around Goldsboro and much further afield . The 1961 Goldsboro B-52 crash received widespread attention last year, when new details were published in a book, Command And Control: Nuclear Weapons, The Damascus Accident, And The Illusion of Safety, by Eric Schlosser. It included maps - engineered by American Institute of . Physics historian Andrew Wellerstein - which showed how millions of Americans could have been affected by the massive nuclear blast with the fallout stretching as far as New York City. The blasts from the Mark 39 bombs - each one 260 times the power of the explosive that was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, in the Second World War - would have killed thousands around Goldsboro. However, fallout calculations show that radiation could have spread all along the Eastern Seaboard - from Washington, DC, to Baltimore, Philadelphia and even New York City - if the wind was blowing in the wrong direction. Devastation: This is the theoretical fallout of the detonation of 8 megatons of nuclear weapons - the combined power of the two hydrogen bombs that fell into North Carolina fields in 1961 . Total loss: Untold thousands of people would have died if even one of the bombs had gone off . May 22nd, 1957: Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico . A cow was killed and residents of Albuquerque terrified when a B-36 aircraft transporting a nuclear bomb from Texas to New Mexico fell through the bomb bay doors from 1,700 feet and detonated, blasting a crater 12 feet deep and 25 feet across. Luckily the nuclear capsule had separated from the bomb and did not explode.February 5th, 1958: Savannah River, Georgia . A B-47 carrying a nuclear bomb collided midair with an F-86 jet during a training flight. The device was jettisoned and fell into the the river and has never been located.March 14th, 1961: Yuba City, California . A crippled B-52 carrying a pair of nuclear bombs suffered a loss of pressure at 10,000 feet. The commander stayed aboard to pilot the plane away from Yuba City in California before ejecting at 4,000 feet. The plane crashed but nothing detonated and the bombs were recovered.January 17th, 1966: Palomares, Spain . A B-52 carrying four hydrogen bombs blew up during an airborne refuel. Both planes and seven of the 11 crew members died in the explosion and all of the nuclear devices fell to the ground. Two exploded on impact near to Palomares and contaminated one square mile with plutonium. Another was recovered from a riverbed and the other fell into the Mediterranean Sea. A local fisherman saw the bomb fall and claimed salvage rights of 1 percent of the nuclear weapons $2 billion value. The Air Force settled out of court. The information made available last year also revealed how the safeties on the second bomb, which landed near Farro, failed - all except for one. The bomb’s parachute deployed – the first step toward detonation. Soon its trigger mechanisms engaged, the bomb was ready to blow. ‘Air Force experts… found that five of the six interlocks had been set off by the fall,’ Dr Ralph Lapp wrote. With millions of lives on the line, the last line of defense held up – a low voltage switch. ‘Only a single switch prevented the 24 . megaton bomb from detonating and spreading fire and destruction over a . wide area,’ Dr Lapp wrote. ‘It would have been bad news in spades,’ he further exclaimed. Despite blasting Dr Lapp’s report for lacking ‘objectivity and accuracy,’ a Sandia national laboratories engineer (according to the Guardian) agreed with the main point. ‘One simple, dynamo technology, low-voltage switch stood between the United States and a major catastrophe!’ The engineer wrote in an added evaluation. Sandia Labs was responsible for the mechanical safety of the bombs. Even worse, as the bomb dropped and the detonation sequence carried out, three of the four safety mechanisms failed, resulting in a firing signal being sent to the bomb's nuclear core when it hit the ground. 'The MK 39 Mod 2 bomb did not possess adequate safety for the airborne alert role in the B-52,' the engineer concluded. Schlosser discovered at least 700 significant accidents in . incidents involving the country's nuclear arsenal between 1950 and 1968. 'The . US government has consistently tried to withhold information from the . American people in order to prevent questions being asked about our . nuclear weapons policy,' he said. 'We were told there was no possibility of these weapons accidentally detonating, yet here's one that very nearly did,' he added. 20 Jan 1961, Washington, DC, USA --- President John F.

"Tomasz Grzonka left his baby outside a priest's home at the Polish Catholic Centre in London Road, Reading, Berkshire, on a 'chilly' night last year, a judge was told . A father abandoned his two-week-old daughter in a bag on a priest's doorstep along with a note asking him for a 'huge favour', a court has heard. The father, along with the girl's mother, placed the child into a black holdall bag along with a silver chain blessed by the Pope and a note. Tomasz Grzonka then left her outside the priest's home at the Polish Catholic Centre in London Road, Reading, Berkshire, on a 'chilly' night last year, a judge was told. He claimed he and his girlfriend, who cannot be named for legal reasons, abandoned the infant as the couple believed they could get into trouble after choosing to have a home birth. The 27-year-old, who worked on his parents' rural Polish farm before coming to Britain in 2008, admitted child cruelty after leaving the infant in the bag on a cool night last May. Daniel Fugallo, prosecuting, said the couple had left the little girl - who also cannot be named for legal reasons - in a bag on the doorstep of the home of Father Edward Stachurski. Mr Fugallo told the court: 'On May 3 last year, at about a quarter to eight at night, he [Father Stachurski] left his home to visit a friend in hospital at the nearby Royal Berkshire Hospital. 'He noted it was a chilly evening. 'He left at 7.45pm and returned at about 9pm and saw, at the top of the steps leading up to his front door, a black sports holdall zipped-up almost completely. 'From inside the bag, Father Edward heard the sound of a baby crying softly. 'He opened it, looked inside and saw a small infant. He took the bag inside and the police were called. 'Inside the bag they found, next to the baby, a baby's bottle, two clean nappies, a dummy, a scarf, a towel, a silver chain and a note in Polish.' The note began 'Blessed be the Lord' and asked the priest for a 'huge favour', requesting he first take the fortnight-old baby to hospital for a check-up before seeing to it that the little girl was brought up by a Polish family. The note added: 'I need to act like this because I am unable to provide dignified conditions for her. 'I am enclosing a neck chain with this letter and ask you to get the future parents to pass it onto her. 'It has been blessed by the Pope.' Father Edward Stachurski left his home to visit a friend in hospital at the nearby Royal Berkshire Hospital (pictured). When he returned he discovered the baby . Paramedics took the girl to hospital and she was examined and found to be fine. A police appeal for information saw the mother's family in Poland contact authorities to say they suspected she may be involved after they recognised the holdall the infant was found in. On May 9 last year police visited the three-bedroom cottage the couple lived in, rent-free, at the dairy farm where Grzonka worked as a £22,000 pounds-a-year farmhand in Hampshire. Both were arrested and the little girl's mother began crying and asked after the welfare of her daughter, said Mr Fugallo. The court heard that the pair - who met on the internet in June 2011 before the woman joined Grzonka in the UK the following month - had £6,000 pounds in bank savings as well as wads of cash in sterling, Euros and US dollars. Grzonka told police at interview his partner had given birth at home on April 19 and the pair had later read on the internet that such practice was illegal in the UK. Fearing their daughter may be taken away from them, they decided to abandon her instead. The father, along with the girl's mother, placed the child into a black holdall bag along with a silver chain blessed by the Pope and a note and left her on a doorstep . About a week before they finally left the girl, the couple had made an abortive attempt to carry out their plan, deciding against going through with it at the last minute as there were several drunks in the area. Describing the events of May 3, Mr Fugallo said: 'They drove to Reading in Mr Grzonka's car with their daughter in the bag on the back seat.' After they arrived Grzonka walked up to the house and, seeing the lights on and cars parked outside, believed the priest would be at home. At 8.24pm, Mr Fugallo said, the baby's mother walked alone to the door with the bag and put her daughter down before ringing the buzzer and then returning to the car. The couple then drove away and it was around 30 minutes before the little girl was found. Neil Griffin, defending, said the 'unusual' case was a result of the two parents being 'unable to cope' in a strange environment far away from home. The little girl had been very well cared for and was wrapped up warm on the night she was found, he said. 'No harm was caused to the child as a result of the very short exposure. 'This is a very different case to other cases of abandonment or cruelty,' added Mr Griffin. Grzonka, who trained in animal husbandry in Poland before studying at the Institute for Animal Health in Britain, was a hardworking individual who wanted to support his family and was now allowed to have supervised contact with his daughter. Mr Griffin said: 'He has, through his guilty plea, shown remorse for what he did that fateful evening.' Grzonka currently earns £400 pounds a month and lives in a caravan with other agricultural labourers in Staffordshire, the court heard. Wearing a grey suit over a blue shirt and grey tie, he sat alongside a female Polish interpreter in the dock. The defendant had admitted a single count of child cruelty at an earlier hearing. Sentencing him to a 16-week jail term, suspended for a year, Judge Ian Grainger described the case as 'unusual and difficult' but said Grzonka's actions represented an 'enormous and unwarranted risk.' The little girl was 'utterly defenceless,' said the judge, who added: 'This was attempted permanent abandonment.' The motivations for the abandonment were 'obscure,' he said. 'In short, this was clearly abandonment that had been planned and reflected on, however immaturely.' A formal not guilty verdict was recorded against the child's teenage mother at an earlier hearing when prosecutors offered no evidence against her on the same count. The blonde, wearing a black dress, was in court to support her partner and clasped his hand as he walked free from the dock.","Tomasz Grzonka claimed he abandoned baby after a .

"He may be one of the most recognisable faces in Qatar, but Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani certainly had issues with New York real estate - until now. The sheikh has reportedly purchased an exclusive Manhattan townhouse after dishing out $47million. Located at 22 E. 71st Street, the property was previously owned by real estate magnate Aby Rosen, the co-founder and president of RFR Holdings. Mr Fix-it: Blair was mediator for two parties, one of which included the Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani last week after a £23bn mining business takeover stalled . The massive mansion is 45 feet wide and complimented by high ceilings and several balconies . Sprawling: The sheikh paid a whopping $47million for the property, located at 22 East 71st Street in Manhattan . Lavish: A living room in the townhouse comes complete with a dining area . The 21,000-square-foot mansion boasts five floors, a reception hall, and a jacuzzi, according to property listings. The New York Post reported that while Rosen was known to host extravagant parties at the property, he never actually lived there. The super-secret deal was reportedly done without a broker to keep the sheikh's name from getting out. A source told the Post: 'The house has been purchased through an LLC, Tower Management Holdings, to protect the identity of the buyer, Sheik Hamad, who has been looking to purchase a New York property.' Buyers and sellers: The townhouse was previously owned by real estate mogul Aby Rosen, pictured left with his wife Samantha Boardman Rosen, and sold to the sheikh, right . In the kitchen: The home has plenty of room for the sheikh, his two wives and 15 children to get something to eat . Fun and games: Complete with a ping pong table, this rec room is ideal for entertaining any of the sheikh's guests . Posh: The house also has an incredible marble staircase and plenty of living space . It was reported last month that al-Thani . had his eyes on a nearly $100million 10,923 square foot penthouse in . the exclusive One57 building, the Big Apple's most expensive. The astronomical fee of the penthouse apartment eclipsed the . $88million forked out by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev on a . penthouse for his daughter last winter at 15 Central Park West. But the Post reported that the sheikh's deal was called off by al-Thani himself because he felt the building's two elevators were not enough for his two wives, 15 kids and entourage of handlers and armed guards. Loss: The sheik called off a deal to purchase a $100million penthouse in the not-yet-completed One57 building, complete with 10,923 square feet and breathtaking views of the city skyline . The view: When completed, the towering One57 building will provide unparalleled views of Central Park . High above the rest: Residents in the penthouse of the shimmering glass tower will look down on their neighbors . He was also reportedly in discussions about . buying four separate, full-floor condos in the exclusive Midtown . building, which would bring the total cost to an incredible $250million. The penthouse, on the 89th and 90th . floors, boasts a ‘grand salon’, at least five bedrooms, four fireplaces, . floor-to-ceiling windows and a large mezzanine, the Post . reported. As well as staggering views over the Manhattan skyline and beyond, the property also features impressive 23-foot ceilings. Al-Thani expressed interest in the Midtown penthouse after his bid for two Fifth Avenue apartments owned by the famously reclusive and recently deceased Huguette Clark, was rejected. Rejected: Al-Thani initially hoped to buy a couple of Fifth Avenue apartments, owned by the late copper heiress Huguette Clark, for $31.5 million but his bid was rejected by the co-op board . Despite offering $500,000 more than the asking price, the powerful PM’s bid . was refused with the building's co-op board - who refused to even grant the . sheikh an interview. It is thought the board stonewalled his offer after it was revealed he planned to knock the two eight floor apartments into one. It was also reported that al-Thani's huge family - . and the entourage of staff who travel with them - also caused concerns . for the co-op board. Other reasons cited for the rejection . were concerns about where his money was coming from and the fact that . the Sheikh is a foreign head of state with diplomatic immunity.

"The French lost little time in ridiculing David Cameron's decision to hold a referendum on Europe saying they will 'roll out the red carpet' for UK Businessmen should Britain vote to leave the EU. French Foreign minister Laurent Fabius was mimicking the Prime Minister's comment last summer, that Britain would welcome Gallic companies if a left-wing government was elected in France. His cheeky quip came as Cameron promised a referendum on the issue of EU membership by 2017 providing he is re-elected. Quip: As David Cameron promised a referendum on Europe, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said his country would 'roll out the red carpet' for British businessmen if the UK voted to leave the EU . Mr Fabius suggested that Britain will turn into a basket case economy if it does exit the EU following the nationwide poll. Speaking on French radio just before Mr Cameron made his keynote speech in London, Mr Fabius said he had told a recent meeting of UK businessmen: ‘If Britain wants to leave Europe we will roll out the red carpet for you.’ Mr Fabius said Britain had ‘positive points’ to offer Europe, but said that there could be no ‘Europe a la carte’ with the UK choosing what it wanted to contribute. ‘Imagine that Europe is a football club,’ said Mr Fabius. ‘You join the football club, but once you’re in, you can’t say “Let's play rugby” ’. Speaking this morning to business . leaders at the Bloomberg headquarters in central London, Mr Cameron . promised to hold a straightforward 'in/out' referendum on Britain’s . membership of the EU. He . declared: 'It is time for the British people to have their say. It is . time to settle this European question in British politics.' Pledge: David Cameron promised an in/out referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union by the end of 2017, if the Conservatives win the next general election . The Prime Minister rejected the . founding EU principle of 'ever closer union', insisting powers must flow . back to, not just away from member states. He warned public . disillusionment with the EU is 'at an all time high'. But he insisted it was in Britain's . interest to remain in a reformed EU, and if he can secure changes he . will argue in favour of staying in. He added: 'Because I believe . something very deeply. That Britain’s national interest is best served . in a flexible, adaptable and open European Union and that such a . European Union is best with Britain in it. 'We will give the British people a . referendum with a very simple in or out choice to stay in the EU on . these new terms or come out altogether. 'Over the coming weeks, months and . years, I will not rest until this debate is won. For the future of my . country. For the success of the European Union. And for the prosperity . of our peoples for generations to come.' Wading in: London Mayor Boris Johnson suggested a French tax on financial transactions would 'cost jobs' in Paris . It was Mr Cameron who, last summer, . infuriated French Socialists by saying  his country would ‘roll out the . red carpet’ to Gallic companies if a left-wing government was elected. The . Socialists did win the election, and since then numerous business . leaders have made plans to emigrate so as to avoid a top tax rate of 75 . per cent. The British and French have clashed repeatedly over European financial policy in recent years, and have always had very different views about the future of the EU. In a high high-profile argument over new European budget rules at a summit in 2011, the then conservative French president Nicolas Sarkozy famously told Mr Cameron he had ‘missed a great opportunity to shut his mouth.’ London Mayor Boris Johnson has also . suggested that France’s determination to implement a tax on financial . transactions would ‘clearly cost jobs’ in Paris and said the UK capital . would benefit. ‘Bienvenue . à Londres – this is the global capital of finance,’ Mr Johnson said . last year. ‘It’s on your doorstep and if your own president does not . want the jobs, the opportunities and the economic growth that you . generate, we do.’ Several hundred thousand French citizens already live and work in London and all of France’s major banks have offices in the UK. Meanwhile German Chancellor Angela . Merkel said her government would be ready to listen to Britain's . 'wishes' over the EU in the hope of finding a 'fair compromise'. She said: 'Germany, and I personally, want Britain to be an important part and an active member of the European Union. 'We . are prepared to talk about British wishes but we must always bear in . mind that other countries have different wishes and we must find a fair . compromise. We will talk intensively with Britain about its individual . ideas but that has some time over the months ahead.' However her foreign minister Guido Westerwelle warned UK against 'cherry-picking' on Europe. Arguing for more European . integration, Mr Westerwelle said: 'Germany wants the United Kingdom to . remain an active and constructive part of the European Union... But . cherry picking is not an option.' Fears: Both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Irish Deputy prime Minister Tanaiste Eamon Gilmore hope that Britain stay within the EU . Gunther Krichbaum, a close ally of . Angela Merkel's and head of the Bundestag european affairs committee said; 'Cameron said that he wants Britain to shape the future. 'How can you shape the future . if you put the car in reverse while other regions of the world are on . the fast lane? 'In a changing world, voices from . Europe will only be heard if we join forces. As the African saying goes: . If you want to travel fast, go alone. If you want to travel far, go . together. 'I'm a bit surprised that Great . Britain wants to renegotiate the rules. Britain is not a new member . state, it did not just join the European Union. 'It had a say in . negotiating all the rules and treaties. If we opened that Pandora's Box, . all the pulling and hauling would start again and we would probably end . up in the same spot. Spain's Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo warned a withdrawal would leave UK industry and commerce balanced on 'a few insular stools' 'By announcing a referendum for 2016, Cameron risks to paralyze the European Union for years. But Great Britain needs a European Union and especially a single market that is functioning.' In Brussels, Martin Schulz, the German president of the European Parliament and a member of the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) seeking to topple Angela Merkel's conservatives at the general election in September, sharply rebuffed Cameron's criticism.He said: 'The reforms necessary to make the EU more effective, more transparent and leaner had failed in part because Britain had blocked them. They are the ones who are largley responsible for the delays in Europe and also the ones pointing their fingers at Europe. 'Britain just wants to reduce the EU to an overseas marketplace.' And Spain's Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo accused Britain of 'dragging its feet' and warned a withdrawal would leave UK industry and commerce balanced on 'a few insular stools'. He said: 'I am convinced that abandoning Europe would be a terrible blow to Britain's finance and industry....trying to compete in isolation with powers like the U.S., China, India and Brazil is not to understand the times in which we are living. 'For the EU it is not good that a country as important as the UK goes, but on the other hand Cameron needs to understand that you cannot keep stopping the engine, cannot seek a renegotiation of treaties undoing what we have done, or putting the brakes on the speed at which the EU is cruising at a time when integration is more necessary than ever. Ireland's deputy prime minister Tanaiste Eamon Gilmore said it was in Britain's best interests to remain within the EU. He said: 'The European Union is better with Britain in it, and I think Britain is better being in the European Union.'","Laurent Fabius was mimicking PM's comment last summer, that Britain would welcome Gallic companies if France elected a left-wing government .

"Israeli police  blocked more than 200 far-right Israeli protesters from rushing guests at a wedding of a Jewish woman and Muslim man as they shouted 'death to the Arabs'.

A . group called Lehava, which organised the wedding demonstration, has . harassed Jewish-Arab couples in the past, often citing religious grounds . for their objections to intermarriage.

Protesters, many of them young men wearing black shirts, denounced Malka, who was born Jewish and converted to Islam before the wedding, as a 'traitor against the Jewish state,' and shouted epithets of hatred towards Arabs including 'death to the Arabs.' They sang a song that urges, 'May your village burn down.' Protesters hold signs and shout slogans against the wedding of groom Mahmoud Mansour, 26, and bride Maral Malka, 23, outside a wedding hall in Rishon Lezion, near Tel Aviv . Israeli police on Sunday blocked more than 200 far-right Israeli . protesters from rushing guests at the wedding of a Jewish woman and . Muslim man as they shouted 'death to the Arabs' Protesters hold signs in support of the wedding of groom Mahmoud Mansour, 26, and bride Maral Malka, 23, outside a wedding hall in Rishon Lezion, near Tel Aviv . A few dozen left-wing Israelis held a counter-protest nearby holding flowers, balloons and a sign that read: 'Love conquers all.' Israeli President Reuven Rivlin, sworn in last month to succeed Shimon Peres, criticised the protest as a 'cause for outrage and concern' in a message on his Facebook page. 'Such expressions undermine the basis of our coexistence here, in Israel, a country that is both Jewish and democratic,' Rivlin, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing Likud bloc, said. A Palestinian bride, Nasreen Abu Tuaima, who lost her home during fighting between Hamas and Israel, walks through the courtyard of a UN school during her wedding ceremony in Rafah in the Gaza Strip . Palestinian bride Basma Abu Rigel, who also lost her home during fighting between Hamas and Israel, is pictured at her her wedding ceremony, along with two other couples in Rafah in the Gaza Strip . Lehava spokesman and former lawmaker Michael Ben-Ari denounced Jews intermarrying with non-Jews of any denomination as 'worse than what Hitler did,' alluding to the murder of 6 million Jews across Europe in World War Two. A surprise wedding guest was Israel's health minister, Yael German, a centrist in Netanyahu's government. She told reporters as she headed inside that she saw the wedding and the protest against it as 'an expression of democracy.' Arab citizens make up about 20 per cent of Israel's majority Jewish population, and the overwhelming majority of Arabs are Muslims. Rabbinical authorities who oversee most Jewish nuptials in Israel object to intermarriage fearing it will diminish the ranks of the Jewish people.

"Two Australian gamers - who clearly have a lot of time on their hands - have converted an old ATM into a popular 1990s video game. YouTuber Ed Jones and his mate Julian bought an old cash machine online and rewired it to play the cult first-person shooter game, Doom. Complete with original sound effects and pictures, the transformed ATM then allows users to play the game using the machine's keypad as a makeshift control pad. Scroll down for Video . The elaborately hatched idea to convert an ATM into an Arcade game . The intricate operation uses a combination of video game and ATM wiring . Doom was developed for the humble computer back in the early 1990s and was a popular first-person sci-fi game . Their handiwork has been uploaded to YouTube, where viewers can see how much work has gone into remodeling the ATM to enable it to function as an arcade game machine. During the clip they discuss the best way to translate the game's controls using the ATM keypad - so that users feel like they're moving, shooting and reloading as if they'd normally withdraw cash. The side buttons, once operational, would become the 'weapons select' function and the receipt-spitting slot would be able to print a player's high score. Ed Jones, or Aussie50 to his YouTube followers, said he bought the ATM as a package of four from Grays Online auctions for just $9 but hasn't disclosed his intentions for the other three. A makeshift computer keyboard gives the gamer the ability to control the game . The video game requires some tweaking in order to get the player back to the start once their game is finished . According to his YouTube channel he is into making 'weekend hobby engineering/scrap metal recycling work' and his onterests include 'gas and diesel engines, electronics, TV and Audio, high voltage and retro PC gaming'. He is perhaps better known as the man behind the video of the rotating washing machine which spun to the point it self destructed. His friend Julian, a 'software developer' who goes by the name jgcertified, is also an active YouTube subscriber who is into PC related inventions. He himself is no stranger with working with difficult hardware, previously designing the software for a billboard-sized LED screen mounted to the back of a truck to run the game Doom.","The ATM was bought online and reconverted into the 90s sci-fi game .

"The top ten U.S. search terms included four variations on Facebook - Facebook.com, Facebook, Facebook login and www.facebook.com - the second year the social networking giant has had four top ten slots. Overall, searches for Facebook accounted for 4.42 per cent of searches - a 24 per cent increase in a year, according to web-monitoring firm Experian Hitwise. Other web giants such as YouTube made up the rest of the top ten. Most people prefer to search rather than type in an address, said Hitwise. In the UK, 'Daily . Mail' is 14th from the top in search terms - and the Daily Mail charts far higher than . all other British newspapers. Facebook - and variants on the term made up four out of the top ten slots in the most searched-for terms of 2011, revealed data released by web monitoring firm Experian Hitwise . The habit of typing in favourite websites, rather than entering them in the address bar, is partly driven by 'predictive search', where Google or other search engines 'fill in' search terms as you type. It's just easier to search rather than type in a web address that might not work. Most of us simply can't be bothered to move the cursor up the screen to type in a fiddly address when Google or other search engines will fill it in for us. It's also much easier on mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets, where typing and navigating can be difficult. In the UK in particular, people are keen on brevity - unlike the US, the abbreviation 'FB' - no prizes for guessing what it's short for' - made the top ten for the first time this year. New terms that entered the top 50 U.S. search terms for 2011 included amazon.com, hotmail, and twitter. Analysis of the search terms revealed that social networking-related terms dominated the U.S. results, accounting for 4.18 percent of the top 50 searches. 'Navigational searches dominated the top search results as users typed in terms versus typing in the URL in the browser bar,' said Simon Bradstock, general manager of Experian Hitwise. 'It's a result of predictive search functions across major search engines.' Celebrities don't even begin to enter the U.S. chart - compiled across all search engines - till 92nd place, where Justin Bieber scored the top slot.

When Ken called in a team of experts to investigate, they found a footprint and claimed to catch the mysterious 15ft tall creature on an infrared camera. Evidence: A footprint thought to be that of a bigfoot is seen on Ken's property. To show scale, it is pictured next to the foot of investigator Chuch Schnitizius . Prints: Investigators found several large prints near a creek . Ken said he first noticed something was amiss when two rocks were thrown over his head as he visited a sandy creek on his land, according to ABC 7. Then piles of wood started to be mysteriously moved around his 200-acre property, sometimes blocking his drive. Search: Tom Biscardi led the investigation into claims of a bigfoot sighting . With the nearest neighbors more than a mile away and locked gates barring the way to trespassers, Ken, who is in his 60s, said he is sure the strange goings on are not the work of a person. It was when his brother visited and used a hunter-like call that was responded to, that Ken started to suspect a bigfoot may have moved on to the property. 'He yelped like ""whoop, whoop, whoop"" and after about five minutes of the whooping there was two or three whoops that came from here,' Ken said as he pointed to the woods behind his home. 'A few days later they took my couch and dropped it and dragged it 20ft towards the house,' he added, referring to a porch swing that had been removed. Ken, who ditched his Silicon Valley career for a more rural lifestyle in the 1990s, turned to a team of experts dedicated to checking out sasquatch sightings, who visited his property to investigate. Tom Biscardi, of Searching For Bigfoot, led the investigation and said the sighting may have been down to the mysterious creatures' migratory habits. 'There's the migratory trail that these creatures travel,' Mr Biscardi, from California's Redwood City, said. 'The area that we were at, the gentleman’s land happens to be in the same range of the migratory trail.' Bait: Chuck hoists an open jar of peanut butter and sardines into a tree to lure a bigfoot into view . Tracking: A motion detecting camera is set up on Ken's property. The team say they later glimpsed a bigfoot on an infrared camera . Although he refused to divulge details of the migratory path, Mr Biscardi said Ken's property offered the creatures, who usually travel in packs of between three and eight, shelter and a good food source. With his team of three, Mr Biscardi recorded a sighting of the bigfoot by luring it into view with a bait of sardines and peanut butter. 'We had seen something large walk up like a man,' Mr Biscardi told the Red Bluff Daily News. Ruling the sighting out as a bear, he added: 'Bears don't walk more than 15ft on their hind legs unless they're fighting. Plus, they'd be hibernating.' The crew also managed to record a large footprint found in the sandy creek where Ken had his first encounter. Mr Biscardi, who is due to appear in 'found footage' style film Pursuit about bigfoot investigators, said about 8,000 of the creatures are estimated to roam the U.S. and said they were only violent if threatened. Expert advice: After experiencing strange goings on at his California home Ken called in the Searching for Bigfoot team . Trap: A peanut butter and sardine lure hangs on a branch in an area believed to be on the creatures' migratory path . Ken added: 'They’re not here to kill anybody I don’t think. He just, I think, wants to claim this portion as his. And [is saying] keep out.' The property owner said he is willing to leave the bigfoot alone, even if it means no longer visiting the riverbank near his home. Mr Biscardi and his team, who hope to one day catch a live bigfoot, also plan to return to do a more indepth search of the wooded area. Not wanting to cause any trouble, Ken plans to leave the bigfeet alone even if it means no longer relaxing on the riverbank near his home.","Partial large footprint spotted in sandy creek of rural Californian home .

"A top Homeland Security official accused of sexual discrimination has stepped down from her job after two more employees this week lodged complaints about her 'lewd' behaviour. Suzanne Barr, the Immigrant and Customs Enforcement chief-of-staff, has 'voluntarily placed herself on leave' while an internal review takes place, it emerged last night. The two ICE employees have submitted sworn affidavits alleging graphic comments made by Barr and another top official working for Homeland Security boss Janet Napolitano. Both statements detail incidents said to have taken place in 2009, reports Fox News. They were given as part of a discrimination lawsuit filed earlier this year by James T Hayes Jr, the head of the New York ICE office. Barr is also mentioned in that lawsuit, which alleges Napolitano turned the Department of Homeland Security into a female-run 'frat house' where male staffers were routinely humiliated and on the receiving end of 'sexually charged games'. Barr, who has been the ICE's chief of staff since January 2009, repeatedly targeted men because of their gender and once called a male employee's hotel room to use sexually explicit language, the suit claims. In one of the new affidavits, an ICE employee claims Barr said to a senior executive, 'You a sexy m*****-f*****'. It continued: 'She then looked at his crotch and asked, ""How long is it anyway?"" Several employees laughed nervously.' 'Favourite': A lawsuit has claimed that Homeland Security boss Janet Napolitano (right) gave Dora Schriro (left) a promotion over more qualified men due to their 'long-standing relationship' The other witness statement details a . trip to Colombia in late 2009 made by Barr, ICE director John Morton . and Ray Parmer, ICE special agent in charge of Homeland Security . Investigations in New Orleans. Barr . and Parmer were 'drinking heavily' at the house of the deputy chief of . mission for the U.S. embassy, when Parmer allegedly took the BlackBerry . of another ICE employee, Peter Vincent, and sent 'lewd messages' to . Barr. The affadavit said: 'During this party, Suzanne Barr approached me and offered to' perform a sex act. Both witness statements were this week submitted to the defence attorney in the lawsuit Hayes filed against Napolitano. While Napolitano is named as the sole defendant, the suit details the behaviour of her advisers Barr and Dora Schriro. Barr, who was born in Phoenix, studied at the University of Arizona before working in Washington D.C. for four years as a staff assistant for Sen. John McCain. She went on to receive her J.D. from Arizona State University College of Law. Denial: The suit does not outline the nature of the relationship. Napolitano, pictured, has denied she is gay . Before becoming chief of staff, she worked as Napolitano's deputy director and  director of legislative affairs, and served as her policy advisor on law enforcement issues. It is unknown whether or not she is married. In the lawsuit, Hayes . claims Napolitano awarded a job to a less-qualified woman, Schriro, . with whom she has a 'long-standing relationship', over him. James T Hayes Jr, the head of the New York ICE office, filed a discrimination lawsuit against Napolitano earlier this year. The latest affidavits have been submitted to his attorney . He . alleges Napolitano favoured Schriro, who had worked as director of the . Arizona Department of Corrections when Napolitano was governor of the . state, for a job due to their relationship. The . lawsuit does not outline the exact nature of the relationship between . Napolitano and the woman she brought with her to Washington from . Arizona. It has long been rumoured that 'Big Sis' Napolitano is a lesbian, but in 2002 she publicly denied the claims. Schriro . is a widow; she was married for just ten months in 1991 before her . husband, St Louis's director of public safety Gay Carraway, died of . cancer. He was 20 years her senior. She . has previously gushed about how much she looks up to Napolitano, naming . her as one of her greatest influences - alongside her late husband and . grandparents. 'Janet . Napolitano is one of the smartest people I’ve ever met,' she told . Education Update. 'She's totally capable of having a great time wherever . she is and regardless of the workload.' In . the suit Hayes also accuses Barr of repeated 'sexually offensive . behaviour' intended to 'humiliate and intimidate male employees'. On . one occasion, Barr called a colleague in his hotel room and screamed . using sexually explicit language, telling him she 'wanted his c*** in . the back of [her] throat'. Hayes claims he 'felt that he was being targeted because of his gender' and witnessed Barr repeatedly picking on men. She . 'created a frat-house type atmosphere that is targeted to humiliate and . intimidate male employees', according to court papers. 'Frat house': Napolitano's department became a workplace where men were regularly humiliated, it is claimed . In . 2009, she 'removed the entire contents of the offices of three male . employees, including nameplates, computers and telephones, to the men’s . bathroom at ICE headquarters'. Once . she took a male special agent's work phone and messaged his female . supervisor 'indicating that the male employee had a crush on the female . supervisor and fantasised about her'. The . suit adds: 'Further, Barr promoted and otherwise rewarded those male . employees who play along with her sexually charged games.' Hayes is seeking relief for $335,000 in damages. ICE Director of Public Affairs Brian Hale last week dismissed the allegations as 'unfounded'. In . a statement, he said last night: 'ICE has referred these allegations to . the DHS Office of Inspector General and the ICE Office of Professional . Responsibility for review. Ms Barr has voluntarily placed herself on . leave pending the outcome of this review.'","Suzanne Barr, the Immigrant and Customs Enforcement chief-of-staff, has 'voluntarily placed herself on leave' while an internal review takes place .

"Apple could launch its iPhone trade-in programme alongside its next generation iPhone as early as next month, according to industry sources. 9to5mac and MacRumours have reported that Apple is now beginning its final preparations for the programme which will allow customers to exchange an existing iPhone for a newer model at a discounted price. Sources claim that Apple has already . sent materials to its stores to support the initiative, with the first . line of store trainers receiving instructions about the programme this . week. Apple could launch its iPhone trade-in programme alongside its next generation iPhone as early as next month, according to industry sources . According to TechCrunch, values can range depending on a variety of factors, including device colour, physical damage and liquid damage. The range is thought to be around $120-200 (£77-129) for 16GB iPhone 4 and 4S models. TechCrunch claims a 16GB iPhone 5 in good condition could go for around $250 (£161),  less than is being offered by some of the other trade-in sites. Up until now, Apple has offered a recycling program, but only offers a . 10 per cent discount on iPod trade-ins. There is also a Web-based . recycling service for used iPhones, iPads . or Macs. The new trade-in programme will allow consumers to receive payment for their devices instantly and . avoid the hassle of shipping their older gadgets, according to information obtained in June by Bloomberg News. According to TechCrunch, values can range depending on a variety of factors, including device colour, physical damage and liquid damage .

According to Bloomberg, Apple shares have declined 38 per cent . since September, weighed down by investor concerns that the company’s . era of massive growth, fueled by the 2007 debut of the iPhone, is over.

Reports from advertising industry firm AdAge claims Apple is expected to launch its iTunes Radio streaming-music service in the U.S  in September.It has also claimed that brands such as McDonald's, Pepsi and Nissan will be main advertisers through the service.Apple's iTunes Radio was announced at its WWDC event in June and the release was tipped as being sometime in the 'Fall'.It was initially rumoured to launch at the same time as the company's new iOS 7 software in October. Used iPhones which have been traded-in at Apple stores in the U.S. will be resold in emerging markets, where Apple’s share is lower and demand for cheap devices is greater so that the resale of Apple’s older models won’t cannibalise iPhone 5 sales in the U.S., an insider told Bloomberg News. Selling used iPhones in emerging markets may also keep first-time smartphone buyers from committing to the Android system. Apple was once the main player in the smart phone industry, but has lost market share to competing Android phones over the past year. 'This will help them sell more . phones, because it will lower the consumer’s out-of-pocket expense,' Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics LLC in Dedham told Bloomberg . News. Getting more people to buy iPhones, new or used, is also becoming more important as Apple begins introducing services that are delivered via mobile devices . 'The key is to get iPhones into as many people’s hands as possible,' Piecyk, told Bloomberg. 'Selling used phones is one way to do that.' The programme is expected to arrive as the company unveils its next generation of iPhone hardware at a media event on September 10. Japanese website believes it has confirmation that the successor to iPhone 5 will be called the iPhone 5S, and that Apple’s rumoured low-cost iPhone will be known as the iPhone 5C. The website Macotakara said that its 'sources in Asia' have confirmed the names, which have long been under speculation.The C in the iPhone 5C is thought to stand for 'colour' which could suggest that the phone will come in a range of colours, rather than the standard black and white options. Other rumoured updates on the new iPhone 5S include an slow-motion camera and a fingerprint sensor since a string of code in the latest release of its latest iOS7 Software implied a scanner function.","Customers can trade in old iPhones for a discount on new models .

"Actress Jennifer Aniston, pictured holding a glacéau smartwater, has fronted several ad campaigns for the bottled water in America . It was hailed as ‘pure’ when it was launched in Britain a decade ago and advertised as having been through a ‘highly sophisticated purification process’. But Coca-Cola’s first attempt at bottled water turned out to be a disaster, after it was forced to recall all 500,000 Dasani bottles when it emerged it was in fact glorified tap water. However, ten years on and the soft drinks giant is set to launch another assault on Britain’s £1.4billion bottled water market – this time with a healthy ‘smartwater’ which promises to be from a natural spring. Coca-Cola GB, which also owns Fanta, Sprite and Dr Pepper, has revealed plans to launch its glacéau smartwater – which is one of its biggest products in America and favoured by celebrities including Jennifer Aniston – in the UK. It is set to pump £3million into launching the product which this time will come from proper spring water. Having learnt lessons from the first time around - when the drinks company was found to be making Dasani from purified tap water in Sidcup, south-east London - this time it is set to do things properly. With its production plant in Morpeth, Northumberland – where it currently oversees the lesser-known Abbey Well brand – the drinks giant claims its smartwater will come via a process whereby it is vapour distilled before electrolytes are added for a ‘crisp, clean taste’. Jon Woods, general manager of Coca-Cola GB & Ireland, said the premium product, which is set to hit shelves in August, would come ‘without the premium price’. Coca-Cola GB is set to pump £3million into launching its glacéau smartwater, which will be made from natural spring water at its production plant in Morpeth, Northumberland . The recommended retail price for a 600ml bottle will be 57p - the same price charged by rivals for a 500ml bottle. An 850ml bottle will be put on the market for 89p. Mr Woods said: ‘Glacéau smartwater presents a great opportunity for us to grow our presence in the water category. ‘We have seen the success that the brand has delivered in the US market – and look forward to offering consumers a premium brand without the premium price. ‘We now have 22 brands in the UK . including many low or no calorie options and provide people with a wide . range of drinks to suit their lifestyle.’ The company withdrew all 500,000 Dasani bottles from sale in March 2004 after the water was found to be contaminated with illegal levels of Bromate - a chemical linked to cancer if consumed in high quantities . According to marketing industry . sources, actress Jennifer Aniston could even be lined-up to help launch . the product in Britain, having already been the face of it across the . Atlantic. Glacéau smartwater was first launched in the US in 1996. The brand has grown strongly in the last seven years and is now the leading premium water brand in the US. Coca-Cola, which has 106 water brands, already sells Glaceau vitaminwater - a range of fruit-flavoured drinks - in the UK. In . 2004, Coca-Cola ran into trouble after it began selling the premium . bottled water Dasani, which turned out to be filtered tap water from . Sidcup in south-east London. The . company decided to withdraw all 500,000 Dasani bottles from sale after . the water was found to be contaminated with illegal levels of a chemical . linked to cancer. It came weeks after it emerged the source for Dasani was the mains supply to Coca-Cola's factory in Sidcup. The company said a ‘highly sophisticated purification process’ meant the product was ‘as pure as bottled water gets’ But . it was found to have levels of bromate - a chemical considered harmful . if consumed in large quantities - which exceeded UK legal standards.","Coca-Cola GB plans to launch glacéau smartwater in Britain in August .

"Posing in just their underwear, these two men were happy to be photographed enjoying a day by the sea. But what the pair did not realise was that the pictures - taken on a stolen iPhone - were being sent straight to the owner’s computer. After stripping down to their boxer shorts on the beach at Southend, Essex, the men took a series of embarrassing pictures and ‘selfies’, or self-portraits. Fun in the sun: These pictures of men paddling in the sea in their underwear were sent from a stolen iPhone . Happy snaps: The victim received dozens of pictures such as these of men in their underwear on the beach . The iPhone used to take the . cringeworthy photographs was stolen from Becky Brinklow as she ate lunch . with her 16-month-old son Henry at a restaurant a short walk from the . seafront. When the . 27-year-old nurse logged on to her computer the next day she was . surprised to find the photographs of the men frolicking by the sea. Pictures: The iPhone was stolen from Becky Brinklow as she ate lunch with her 16-month-old son at a restaurant in Southend . For . her iPhone was set up to automatically send pictures taken on it to the . iCloud website, which backs up data such as music and pictures stored . on smartphones. Miss . Brinklow said she had seen the funny side when she realised the men had . accidentally uploaded pictures of their day at the beach to her iCloud . account. She said: ‘Luckily I . had insurance and within a day I had received a new phone so then I . went online to access all the pictures and upload them to the new one. ‘I went online and thought “this is strange” – there were all these pictures of these men and their friends at the beach. ‘It . was actually quite comical looking through the pictures and me and my . fiancé Tom ended up laughing about the men and all their posing. 'It was funny seeing these strangers down to just their pants – they certainly liked posing for a picture.’ Miss . Brinklow said she was thankful that she had not lost any precious . photos of Henry. ‘If I had lost all the pictures on my phone it would . have been a lot more upsetting but I have been able to retrieve those . because they were all stored online.’ She . added: ‘We managed to block the phone and wipe it, leaving it useless, . and we used the “Find My iPhone” app to find out roughly where they . live.’ Investigation: The victim has handed the pictures and information to police who now investigating . Brazen: The victim found the photos through her iCloud account . It is not clear how . the two men pictured in the photographs came into possession of the . phone, or suggested they knew it was stolen. Miss Brinklow was due to make a formal statement to police last night. Police . will open an investigation into the crime after they have taken the . statement and it is anticipated arrests will be made soon. Miss . Brinklow’s fiancé Tom Humble, 26, said the phone was stolen last . Wednesday. Mr Humble, a shop manager, said: ‘She was in there with her . mum and our 16-month-old son. ‘Two blokes came over and they started talking to them. ‘One . of them leaned over and picked up a chip off the plate and while they . were distracted, the other one must have picked up the phone off the . table. The restaurant have it on CCTV.’ The CCTV images of the iPhone being taken from the Varsity Bar in Southend are understood to be of high quality. iCloud is a data storage service provided by Apple that allows users to view their photos, music,  contacts and calendar entries on separate computers and smartphones. For example, when a photo is taken on an iPhone - as in the case of Southend nurse Becky Brinklow - it is sent to the user’s iCloud account and then automatically downloaded to the user’s iPad, laptop and computer, making it both a storage tool and a system to keep all data synchronised across multiple devices. Because all the user’s data is stored remotely by iCloud, it means that if an iPhone, iPad or computer is stolen, the contents will not be lost. iCloud was launched on October 12, 2011, and has 320million users.","The phone was taken from table at Varsity bar in Southend, Essex .

"Hard-liners in Iran have unveiled two new 'Death to America' songs at the former U.S. Embassy in Tehran, hoping to keep anger high ahead of nuclear talks with Western powers. They performed the songs on Saturday ahead of a massive planned protest Monday to mark the anniversary of the U.S. Embassy takeover in 1979. 'Death to America' was one of the main slogans of the Islamic revolution that year. The anniversary this year is drawing greater attention due to hard-line opposition to moderate President Hassan Rouhani's outreach to the West as talks over the country's contested nuclear program continue. Hard-liners also criticized Rouhani's historic telephone conversation with U.S. President Barack Obama in September, a gesture aimed at ending three decades of estrangement between the two countries. Authorities pulled down dozens of anti-U.S. banners and posters around Tehran last week. Iranians from the Islamic hardline Basiji volunteer militia hold flags reading 'Down with USA' as they take part in a protest against America inside the former US embassy in Tehran today. The hard-liners have vowed to continue the chant used in the 1979 Islamic revolution called 'Death to America' and have unveiled two new versions of the song . An Iranian student from the Islamic hardline Basiji volunteer militia holds a flag reading ""Down with USA"" as she takes part in a protest against America inside the former US embassy in Tehran today . But Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards said that 'Death to America' will remain their slogan regardless of the relationship between the Islamic republic and Washington. 'Death to America is the manifestation of our nation's determination and resistance against the dominance of oppressive and untrustworthy America,' it said on its sepahnews.com website. 'The revolutionary hatred of Iranians will be manifested nationwide with slogans of ''Death to America''.' November 4 is the 34th anniversary of the seizure of the US embassy in Tehran, during which Islamist students captured and held 52 US diplomats hostage for 444 days. The crisis triggered a cut in diplomatic relations and led to decades of mutual hostility. Despite the public protests, Iran's new president Hassan Rouhani, who has pledged to improve ties with the West . U.S. President Barack Obama held a historic telephone conversation with Iran's new president Hassan Rouhani last month . 'American espionage against governments and people in different countries is proof that leaders of the White House can not be trusted,' the Guards said, referring to a row between Europe and Washington over alleged US spying on its allies. Iran's new president Hassan Rouhani, who has pledged to improve ties with the West, held a historic telephone conversation with US President Barack Obama last month on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly.It was the first direct contact between leaders of the two countries in more than three decades.

"Victim: Frances Bloomfield's body was discovered in a ditch near Rockford, Illinois, bound with ligatures and wrapped in plastic on September 22, 1996 . The husband of a woman who was strangled to death and dumped in a ditch 16 years ago has been arrested thanks to DNA evidence, it emerged today. John Bloomfield, 73, was arrested at his home in St Paul, Minnesota, on Tuesday charged with first-degree murder in the death of wife Frances Bloomfield. Iowa City police said DNA on material used to bind the body was consistent with his DNA. Bloomfield - a researcher at the . University of Iowa - returned from a business trip to France at 6.30am . on September 22, 1997, and reported that his wife was missing. He said there . were several areas in the home spotted and pooled with blood. Hours later, her body was discovered in a . ditch 177 miles away in Illinois, bound with ligatures and wrapped in plastic. Medical examiners said she had probably been dead two days. There was no evidence of sexual assault. Officials ruled cause of death as . strangulation by ligature - someone used a cord or similar device to . strangle Bloomfield after she'd fought a bloody battle for her life. Authorities discovered her missing vehicle two months later in New . Jersey. Neighbors told officials they last saw Bloomfield outside her home on Saturday afternoon between 5:30 and 6pm. Marital home: John Bloomfield returned from a business trip to France at 6.30am on September 22 and reported that his wife was missing and there were several areas in the home spotted and pooled with blood . Crime scene: A search warrant of the home turned up seven separate blood stains from different areas, including a bedroom, hallway and garage . John Bloomfield was a suspect in the murder but was never charged with anything. Detectives poured through evidence taken from the car and the home. He had filed expense vouchers with the University of Iowa for his trip to France and said he rented a car from Chicago airport on September 21 and drove to his home. One year after Bloomfield’s murder, investigators said the case remained open but there was a possibility it may never be solved, Iowa Cold Case reports. 'At this time the statistics are against us in solving the case, but that doesn’t mean we will stop investigating,' Iowa City Police Department investigations commander Dan Sellers told the Daily Iowan in 1998.

"A British woman has been arrested for allegedly helping organise a £4.3million timeshare fraud that targeted thousands of tourists. Paula Beatson is one of 58 people – mostly Britons – held when police raided timeshare showrooms in Gran Canaria. The 44-year-old is believed to be the financial brain behind a scam in which about 2,000 holidaymakers paid up to £25,000 each for timeshare properties that they could not use. Paula Beatson (second from left) and Eugen Kaiser (in white shirt). Beatson was one of the Britons arrested in Gran Canaria on fraud charges relating to the sale of timeshares that do not exist . British citizens are among 58 people busted in Gran Canaria for allegedly raking in £5million by selling timeshare properties that never existed to 2,000 victims . It is claimed that swarms of sales . agents posing as representatives of the Canary Island tourist office . targeted British tourists on the streets of towns in the island’s south. The ‘tiqueteros’ (ticket touts) would . snare potential clients with prize-winning ‘scratch cards’ and supposed . free gifts, encouraging them to attend a promotion. Some customers were even given a free . taxi ride to attend intensive sales pitches at the timeshare base in an . apartment complex called Club Puerto Atlantico in Arguineguin. Once inside they could be subjected to . eight hours of ‘hard sell’ of a scheme that would give them access to . luxury holidays at a heavily discounted rate. Customers are believed to have paid . out between £4,300 and £25,000 for the guarantee of 70 per cent . discounts at some of the world’s top resorts for between five and 30 . years. But the timeshare sellers were allegedly using the glossy . brochures of other top holiday firms to sell the concept. Spanish police raided offices and showrooms in Arguineguin and Mogan on Monday after being tipped off that staff were deliberately deceiving tourists over the timeshare schemes (stock image) Even the discounts they offered could be found in a high street travel agent. A Spanish police source said: ‘They were selling a complete and utter lie.’ They are accused of carrying out the fraud since 2007. Spanish news agencies yesterday . reported that the ‘well-organised group’ used various business names to . carry out the con. They allegedly included Voyager Travel and Lifestyle . Holidays as well as companies that promised to extract tourists from any . preexisting timeshare agreements. Paula Beatson, believed to be from . Lancashire, was named as one of those arrested along with German Eugen . Friedrich Kaiser and Norwegian Kieron Day. It is understood that both . Beatson and Kaiser were previously accused of fraud in 2006 but were not . convicted of any crime. The Mindtimeshare Association, a . Spanish watchdog, became aware of the group after receiving more than 60 . complaints. It contacted police, who launched ‘Operation Voyager’, . leading to the arrests on Monday. Alberto Garcia, the director of . Mindtimeshare, said: ‘Paula was the financial brain of the operation. After several years of thorough analysis and collection of the victim’s . testimonials, the Mindtimeshare Association decided to present a formal . demand to the Spanish police. ‘This demand has been backed up by . strong evidence of how this organised gang was lying and cheating in . order to make the tourists fall into their trap and make them buy their . allegedly fraudulent product.’ Those arrested have been released on . bail after giving statements. The Special Organised Crime Unit is . continuing its investigations.

"Labour has accepted hundreds of thousands of pounds from a giant accountancy firm which the party's own MPs have accused  of promoting tax avoidance schemes on an 'industrial scale'. PricewaterhouseCoopers donated £386,605 to Ed Miliband's party last year, new figures published by the electoral commission revealed this morning. The revelation is a major embarrassment for Mr Miliband after he spent last week attacking David Cameron for turning a blind-eye to tax avoidance. Ed Miliband's Labour Party accepted £386,605 in donations from the accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers last year . Margaret Hodge, the Labour chair of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, has previously criticised the party for accepting donations from the accountancy firm. She said: 'The Conservatives took money from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) when they were in opposition, the Labour Party does and probably the Liberal Democrats too. I think that's inappropriate, I wouldn't do it.' Her comments came after her committee – which acts as the Commons' spending watchdog – issued a blistering report condemning the way that PwC devised 'complex strategies and contrived structures' to help big companies dramatically reduce their tax bills. A spokesman for PwC told MailOnline it did not make cash donations to any political party. He said: 'The figure published by the Electoral Commission relates to the secondment of junior members of staff to provide limited and fully disclosed technical support (such as research and analysis).' Once trade union cash is stripped away, PwC's donation was the fourth biggest donation to all political parties in 2014. The three biggest donations in the last three months of 2014 were all from trade unions to Labour, with Unison handing over £1,384,289 to Mr Miliband's party, Unite donating £1,336,570 and GMB £1,088,810. The Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers also gave £416,872 to Labour. Margaret Hodge, the Labour chair of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said it was 'inappropriate' to accept donations from PwC . The Tories reported more than £1 million more in donations than Labour in the final three months of 2014 . The Tories' largest donation was £500,000 from Michael D Gooley, while Lord Michael Glendonbrook gave £334,000 and David J Rowland donated £322,700. The Lib Dems received £400,000 from Max Batley while Ukip received £394,254 from Rock Services Limited. The Tories reported more than £1 million more in donations than Labour in the final three months of 2014 as the parties sought to boost their election war chests. The Conservatives reported donations totalling £8,345,687 while Labour reported £7,163,988, the Electoral Commission figures showed. The Liberal Democrats reported £3,038,500 in donations, Ukip £1,505,055 and the Green Party £248,520. The latest regular release of donation information comes amid a bitter political row between Labour and the Tories over the tax affairs of party supporters. MPs have accused PwC of promoting tax avoidance schemes on an 'industrial scale' Mr Miliband accused the Tory leader of being a 'dodgy Prime Minister surrounded by dodgy donors'. The total donations reported by political parties between October 1 and December 31 2014 was £20,326,862, more than £5 million higher than the previous three month period. The total is also higher than the £17,419,277 recorded in the final quarter in 2009 when parties were preparing to fight the 2010 general election. Ed Balls, Chuka Umunna and Tristram Hunt are among those who have accepted help from PwC staff - worth tens of thousands of pounds each. The revelation is particularly damaging because PwC has placed its staff in Labour teams drawing up official policies on economic issues, including tax. In a statement released last month, PwC said that it had provided staff to work in Parliament who provided 'limited and fully disclosed technical support' to the main political parties on areas in which the firm had particular expertise or knowledge of the business environment. A total of 11 Labour MPs have had a member of the company working in their Westminster offices in the last year. Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor, has had two members of staff from the accountancy firm working with him, worth the equivalent of £64,162. PwC has also been eager to forge strong links with Chukka Umunna, the shadow business secretary. On three separate occasions he lists having had PwC research assistants working in his office, a perk worth a staggering £99,550. Shaban Mahmood, Cathy Jamieson, Catherine McKinnell all received a 'technical support analyst' to help with their role as shadow treasury minister, worth £57,078. Tristram Hunt, the shadow education secretary, also had a research assistant for six months at a value of £74,655, the equivalent of £149,310-a-year salary, and nearly £7,000 more than the Prime Minister is paid. The shadow work and pensions secretary, Rachel Reeves, also has a £63,045 PwC analyst to help in her office right up until the next General Election. Shadow Labour ministers including Tristram Hunt (left), Chuka Umunna (centre) and Ed Balls (right) have accepted donations from PricewaterhouseCoopers . Jim Murphy, the recently elected leader of the Scottish Labour Party, was given a £29,435 research assistant by the company while he was the shadow secretary for international development. Tessa Jowell, who is standing down at the next election, had the help of two PwC staff costing the company £81,970. She states in the register that the staff worked part-time and were shared with another MP, although does not say who. The Edinburgh South backbencher, Ian Murray, has a £45,000 PwC employee on secondment until May. John Healey, the former shadow health minister, also had a research officer at a cost of £32,670 to help him work on housing and housing benefit policy. In total it gave 4,827 hours of support to political parties in 2013. Last year, it used it staff to provide 4,493 to Labour MPs and 1,511 hours to Liberal Democrats. Labour defended the arrangements, saying that PwC had provided long-standing support to all three main political parties on a non-party basis. 'Given the complexity of government and that opposition parties do not have significant access to civil servants, the support provided by organisations such as these helps ensure that there is better scrutiny of Government policy,' a spokesman said. 'Where organisations provide staff to support research and analysis for opposition parties it is right that these are declared – as currently happens – in the Register of Members' Interests.' PwC said in a statement: 'PwC has no political affiliation. Our people provide limited and fully disclosed technical support to the main political parties in areas where our expertise and knowledge of the business environment can help them better understand technical matters and the consequences of their policy proposals. We do not develop policy on their behalf.'","PricewaterhouseCoopers donated £386,605 to Ed Miliband's party last year .

"A grieving mother has told how her beautiful daughter was murdered and failed by South Africa's justice system in a chilling echo of the Oscar Pistorious case. British-born Lauren Sleep, 25, was allegedly strangled by her jealous boyfriend Chad Khan who feared their relationship was about to end. But her family claim that Khan has evaded arrest for eight years because of his family's status in South Africa and been allowed to disappear. And like the family of Reeva Steenkamp - who saw Pistorious jailed for just five years for culpable homicide - they fear they will never fully get justice. Let down: Lauren Sleep (left), 25, who was allegedly strangled by her jealous boyfriend Chad Khan. Lauren's mother Marilyn claims that Khan has evaded arrest for eight years because he was allowed to disappear . Chad Khan (left) and Lauren. She returned to South Africa in 2002 to work as a hostess for a luxury train company in Pretoria and started dating Khan when she was 24 . Lauren's mother Marilyn said: 'Every time I see a picture of Reeva I am reminded of my Lauren. 'Both girls were always smiling and had a sparkle in their eye. 'Like us, Reeva's family haven't had real justice. 'The similarities in our daughters' deaths are startling and highlight a disturbing acceptance of violence against women in South Africa. 'The judicial system is morally bankrupt and needs to be changed. 'Pistorius received a slap on the wrist and I believe Khan's status and family prevented his arrest. 'In a number of high-profile killings, the ineptness of the police has been challenged through expensive defence strategies.' Marilyn with her daughter Lauren Sleep. Lauren was born in Gloucester but moved to South Africa when she was a baby with her mother Marilyn, now 59 . Lauren was born in Gloucester but moved to South Africa when she was a baby with her mother Marilyn, now 59, and father David, 62, a mechanical engineer. When she was 19 she returned to England to live with her aunt in Cheshire where she worked for a finance company and studied accountancy. She returned to South Africa in 2002 to work as a hostess for a luxury train company in Pretoria and started dating Khan when she was 24. Marilyn said she met Khan a few times and he seemed charming and polite. But he had a darker, violent and possessive side to his nature and on the fateful night of January 20 2006 there was an argument. Lauren had been partying with Khan and her friend, Liesel Schoonwinkel but a row broke out when they returned to the cottage of Khan's influential parents in Hercules, Pretoria. Khan left, leaving the girls sleeping but at some point returned. It is alleged he strangled Lauren with a dish cloth before stabbing Liesel in the chest and neck as she slept in the room next door. Khan then fled and has not been seen since. Devastated Marilyn and David lacked confidence in the way the police tackled the case and hired private investigator Ettienne Groenewalk to find Khan and bring him to justice. Mr Groenewalk believed Khan fled to Swaziland, where his father, a wealthy Pretoria politician, had family. The trail then led to Malawi before going cold. Marilyn said: 'Every time we thought we were getting somewhere in the investigation we would then hit a brick wall. It was such an emotional roller coaster. 'After a few months I couldn't handle it any more and I stopped our private investigation.' She added: 'The South African police are inept. They never updated us with anything. 'You don't realise how bad the police are until you experience it first-hand.' Eight years on, Khan is still on the run and Marilyn said: 'To know your daughter has been murdered is one thing. 'To know the killer is still out there walking the streets is another. It makes my blood boil. 'My daughter had been killed. I needed answers and justice for her.' Lauren, pictured, had been partying with Khan and her friend, Liesel Schoonwinkel but a row broke out when they returned to the cottage of Khan's influential parents in Hercules, Pretoria . Lauren with her dad David. She would have been 34 this year. Eight years on, Khan is still on the run . Lauren's family have set up a Facebook page with photos of Khan in the hope someone will spot him and let them know. Her mother added: 'Lauren would be 34 this year and should be happily married with kids. 'How many more girls are going to die before something is done? Who is protecting the victims? 'Every time I hear Reeva's name or see pictures of her my heart breaks a little bit more. Lauren was my Reeva. 'I hope that someone out there can help us get justice, so Lauren can finally rest in peace.' Lauren's mother Marilyn said: 'Every time I see a picture of Reeva (pictured with her killer Oscar Pistorius) I am reminded of my Lauren' Police in Pretoria said they remain keen to question Chad Khan. Colonel Vish Naidoo, of the South African Police Service, said: 'The Lauren Sleep case is still open. 'We continue to hunt for Chad Khan but have no active leads at this time.' Prosecutors in the Pistorius case say they plan to appeal against the lesser conviction of culpable homicide 'on a question of law' - and against the length of the sentence. As things stand, he could be free to go home in ten months.","Lauren Sleep was allegedly strangled by her jealous boyfriend Chad Khan .

"He has gained worldwide fame for his unrivalled skill at solving cases, incredible powers of deduction and grasp of complex science. Now, the real-life figure who inspired Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's infamous detective, Sherlock Holmes, may have been uncovered. Investigator Jerome Caminada captivated Manchester in the 19th century with his logical reasoning, eccentric disguises and impressive crime figures. Scroll down for video . Inspiration? Jerome Caminada (left), an investigator in Manchester during the 19th century, may have been the inspiration behind Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's hero, Sherlock Holmes (depicted, right, by Benedict Cumberbatch) He gained notoriety as a police officer in the city, before rising to national fame in the mid 1880s - shortly before Sherlock Holmes made his debut in A Study in Scarlet in 1887. Now, a biography of Caminada, published this month, reveals the Victorian investigator may have helped inspire Doyle's creation of Holmes. 'Caminada became a national figure at just the time that Sherlock Holmes was being created,' author Angela Buckley told The Sunday Telegraph. 'There are so many parallels that it is clear Doyle was using parts of this real character for his.' Renowned: Holmes has gained worldwide fame for his unrivalled skill at solving cases, powers of deduction and grasp of complex science. Above, Cumberbatch as Holmes (right) and Martin Freeman as Dr John Watson . Similar plotlines: One of the most prominent similarities between Caminada and Holmes was their fascination with an attractive female criminal - notably, Irene Adler in Holmes's case.  And both investigators had an arch-enemy, like Professor James Moriarty. Above, Andrew Scott as Moriarty (left) and Lara Pulver as Adler . Mrs Buckley, a historian and trustee . of the Society of Genealogists, said Caminada, like Holmes, had used an . array of unorthodox methods to capture criminals. These . included prowling the streets at night, wearing elaborate disguises and . maintaining an extensive network of informers, whom he would meet in a . back pew of a church. Jerome Caminada rose to national fame in the mid 1880s - shortly before Sherlock Holmes made his debut in A Study in Scarlet in 1887. Like Holmes, he boasted an array of unrivalled skills, including those of logical reasoning and deduction, the mastery of eccentric disguises and an ability to capture even the most talented of criminals. And the similarities do not stop there. The pair also: . He . also had an in-depth knowledge of Manchester's criminal underclass - . similarly to Holmes's ongoing contact with figures in the underworld, . the Baker Street Irregulars, she said. Born in Manchester in 1844, Caminada worked as an engineer in the city, before joining Manchester City Police Force in 1868. He later worked, like Holmes, as a 'consulting detective' on cases across the country - donning a number of skilled disguises, including a labourer, a drunken lout and various working-class roles. Dubbed 'the Garibaldi of Detectives', he was reportedly responsible for imprisoning a staggering 1,225 criminals - and was reputedly even able to spot a thief simply by the way he walked. Mrs Buckley said one of the most prominent similarities between Caminada and Holmes was their fascination with an attractive female criminal - notably, Irene Adler in Holmes's case. Caminada's own experience saw him track down Alicia Ormonde - a seemingly well-educated, artisocratic woman who was actually a consummate forger and crook - before apparently becoming infatuated by her. He also formed a nemesis called Bob Horridge, a violent career criminal with a number of similarities to Holmes's arch-enemy Professor James Moriarty, a mathematics professor-turned-criminal. The pair had a 20-year feud, before Caminada tackled Horridge in final, dramatic confrontation, where he managed to pull out his revolver a fraction faster than his enemy. The Manchester investigator died in 1914 at the age of 70 - the year the final Holmes book was set. Legend: Sherlock Holmes, created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (left), starred in four novels and 56 short stories . In the past, other people have been put forward as the inspiration for Holmes, who featured in four novels and 56 short stories and is most recently portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch in the BBC series, written by Steven Moffat. In an interview, Doyle said he had taken inspiration from Dr Joseph Bell, a surgeon at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, who was known for drawing large conclusions from small observations. Meanwhile, Sir Henry Littlejohn, a former police surgeon, has also been cited as an influential figure.","Jerome Caminada captivated Manchester in 19th century with detective skills .

"The Yuzu apparently tastes like a cross between a lemon, mandarin and grapefruit . It's been called the world’s sexiest fruit and it’s a darling of chefs, yet you may never have heard of it. So brace yourself for the taste of 2014: yuzu, a rare and costly citrus fruit from Japan, which is predicted to become as popular here as oranges.

"The hunt for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane took an extraordinary twist last night when China said it may have detected a signal from its black box recorder on the floor of the Indian Ocean. The faint signal was picked up by a Chinese search vessel on the twenty-ninth day of the hunt for Flight MH370, just hours before  the recorder’s batteries were expected to die. China’s state-run news agency said the search vessel Haixun 01 picked up the signal on the precise frequency used by black box recorders in a search zone hundreds of miles off the west coast of Australia. A Chinese ship is said to have detected a 'pulse signal' in the southern Indian Ocean today . A white floating object spotted by Chinese air force in the southern Indian Ocean today . The signal was detected using a black . box detector – a remote- controlled missile-shaped submersible – at . around 25 degrees south latitude and 101 degrees east longitude, . according to a Chinese journalist on board the ship. The . signal was picked up for only 90 seconds, suggesting, remarkably, that . if it did come from the plane’s black box recorder it may have been the . final output before the battery died at the end of its 30-day life. Later, . the Xinhua news agency said a Chinese airforce plane had spotted . ‘several white objects’ floating on the surface of the ocean 1,680 miles . from Perth at 11.05am yesterday. The debris was just 55 miles from the . area where the ping  was detected. A . huge underwater search was expected to be launched at daylight to see . if the ship has found the  Boeing 777, which disappeared less than an . hour into a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8 with 239 . passengers and crew on board. Britain’s . HMS Echo – carrying sophisticated equipment that can hear the . recorder’s pings – has joined the hunt and robot submersibles from an . Australian search team are expected to be sent down where the ocean is . up to two miles deep. An 11-strong international flotilla is searching a . vast area of the southern Indian Ocean for the plane. To . hear the black box signals the Chinese ship would have needed to be . almost directly above the shoebox-sized black box, which was housed in . the plane’s tail section. The . discovery would be unprecedented as black box recorders have only ever . been found after a field of debris was detected first. The potential discovery came as Malaysia vowed it would not give up on trying to find the missing jetliner and announced details of a multinational investigation team to solve the aviation mystery, as the search for the plane entered its fifth week . Hishammuddin Hussein, (right) Malaysia's defense minister and acting transport minister, told reporters in Kuala Lumpur that the cost of mounting the search was immaterial compared to providing solace for the families of those on board by establishing what happened . Malaysia . and Australia, which is in charge of the Indian Ocean search, greeted . the news with cautious  optimism last night but advised  people to wait . for developments, anxious that it could turn out to be another false . lead. In the first week . after the plane disappeared, China announced through Xinhua that it had . satellite images of what might be debris from the missing flight in the . South China Sea, only to claim later the data had been put out in error. China . informed Australian officials about the black box signals at lunchtime . on Saturday before breaking ranks to announce the  discovery shortly . after Malaysian officials told journalists at a daily briefing that . there had been no new developments in the search.

Staying positive: After an on-air mammogram revealed that she had a tumor in one of her breasts, further tests revealed that she had a second tumor, more abnormal cells and the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes . Breast cancer: Amy received an on-air mammogram on October 1 (pictured above), after realizing she is the age when she should be getting tested regularly but had been putting it off because she was busy with work and her family . Famous friends: Amy with her husband, Melrose Place actor Andrew Shue, left, and Grant Show, right . Little did she know the life she would be saving would be her own. A mammogram is an x-ray picture of the breast which is used to check for cancer in women who have no signs or symptoms of the disease. It allows the doctor to have a closer look for changes in breast tissue that cannot be felt during a breast exam. It can help reduce the number of deaths from breast cancer in women aged 40 to 70. Mammograms have been controversial and some women have been reluctant to go through with the screening. Potential harm includes false-negative results, false-positive results, over-diagnosis, over-treatment, and radiation exposure. During a mammogram, your breasts are placed between an x-ray plate and a plastic plate which are then attached to the x-ray machine before the breasts are flattened. This spreads the breast tissue out to obtain a clearer picture. Pressure will be felt on the breast for a few seconds and there might be some discomfort but this will only last a few seconds. The whole procedure from start to finish lasts for 20 minutes. A few weeks later, she was asked to come back to the doctors and was so unconcerned, she didn't even bring anyone with her. 'I thought I was going back in for a . few follow-up images, only to find out in a matter of hours that I had . breast cancer,' Amy wrote on her ABC blog. 'I was alone that afternoon, never thinking to bring anyone with me, never thinking that day would be life-altering. 'My . husband was on a business trip and my parents live across the country, . but that night everyone flew into New York City and we started gearing . up for a fight.' She spoke on GMA this morning about . the experience and how it has affected her and her family. 'Robin Roberts and ABC saved my life by telling me to go into that van for a mammogram. 'When I was asked, I want to say I was happy to do my part but honestly I was a little reluctant at first. I'd been asked to do it on air to demystify it for women who might be nervous. 'I'm 40 and I had been putting it off for a number of years - between flying all over the world for work and running around with my kids to school, ballet and gymnastics. Like so many women I just kept pushing it off. 'Telling my children was the toughest part and yesterday I had to tell my grandmother - who is not in the best of health. 'I have to be strong now for other people because I am about to break their hearts.' By her side: Amy Robach's husband Andrew Shue was there at the ABC studios to support his wife as she made the heartbreaking announcement . Alone: Amy said she did not even bring her husband Andrew to the second appointment with the doctor because she thought it was nothing . Family: Amy said she is being strong for her children because she realizes telling them she has cancer will break their hearts . Driving force: Robach, 40, chose the most aggressive form of treatment- a double mastectomy- because she has young children and much to live for, saying she didn't want the chance of a second bout hanging over her . She wrote on her blog: 'On Thursday, November 14, I will go into surgery where my doctors will perform a bilateral mastectomy followed by reconstructive surgery. 'Only then will I know more about what that fight will fully entail, but I am mentally and physically as prepared as anyone can be in this situation. 'And while everyone who gets cancer is clearly unlucky, I got lucky by catching it early, and there are so many people to thank for making sure I did. 'Every producer, every person who urged me to do this, changed my trajectory. The doctors told me bluntly: ""That mammogram just saved your life"".' Amy married her second husband - Melrose Place actor Andrew Shue - in 2010 after meeting him at a book party. She has two daughters to her first husband Tim McIntosh, who she divorced in 2009. Before she moved to ABC, Amy was the Today show weekend host. She left NBC in May 2012. Robin Roberts returned to GMA in February this year, left, still sporting a bald head from chemotherapy and right, back to her usual self at the Country Music Awards last week . Together again: Roberts introduced the show and grinned alongside her fellow GMA hosts in February . Robin Roberts recently returned to Good Morning America after her own battle with breast cancer. She was first diagnosed in 2007 after discovering a lump during a self-examination. She also made the brave decision to announce her illness on air. What followed was a partial mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiation until she finally got the all clear. Then in 2012, she was diagnosed with MDS or myelodysplastic syndrome, which is a disease of the blood and bone marrow which was once known as pre-leukemia. Be the Match Registry, a nonprofit organization run by the National Marrow Donor Program, experienced a 1,800 per cent spike in donors the day Roberts went public with her illness. She took a leave from GMA to get a bone marrow transplant in October 2012 but her recovery was documented on the morning show before she returned to GMA on February 20 of this year.

"Lib Dem MP David Ward was summoned to meet party enforcers to explain comments about the Holocaust he posted on his . website . A Lib Dem MP who sparked a row on the . eve of a Holocaust memorial with comments about 'the Jews' is to escape . censure while he receives training in how not to be offensive. Campaigners . accused Nick Clegg of not taking anti-Semitism seriously after it . emerged that plans to punish Bradford East MP David Ward have been . 'adjourned' while he learns what language to use in future. The . row comes as the Lib Dems reputation has been battered by allegations . of a cover-up over groping claims against Lord Rennard and the . resignation of former Cabinet minister Chris Huhne, who faces jail for . perverting the course of justice. Embattled Lib Dem leader Mr Clegg staged a showdown meeting with Mr Ward over his 'unacceptable' comments in which he accused 'the Jews' of atrocities against Palestinians. Days before the annual Holocaust Memorial Day last month, Mr Ward wrote on his blog: 'Having visited Auschwitz twice - once with my family . and once with local schools - I am saddened that the Jews, who suffered . unbelievable levels of persecution during the Holocaust, could within a . few years of liberation from the death camps be inflicting atrocities on . Palestinians in the new State of Israel and continue to do so on a . daily basis in the West Bank and Gaza.' He . was summoned to the meeting with Mr Clegg and Lib Dem chief whip . Alistair Carmichael where he was told his use of the phrase was . ‘unacceptable and must not be repeated’. During . the hearing Mr Ward agreed to remove the comments from his website and . said he would work with the Liberal Democrat Friends of Israel to ‘agree . language’ that is proportionate, according to the party. But the Holocaust Educational Trust said the Lib Dems' response to the ‘sickening’ comments was ‘disappointing’. Mr Ward's comments came days before Holocaust Memorial Day whih marks the 68th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, where more than one million people, mostly Jews, were killed . The row first blew up over a posting made by Mr Ward after signing a memorial book to mark Holocaust Memorial Day last month. Following the disciplinary meeting Mr Carmichael sent a letter to the MP setting out the party's actions. He . wrote: ‘At the meeting you undertook to work along with Liberal . Democrat Friends of Israel and Simon Hughes MP to identify and agree . language that will be proportionate and precise in your future . interventions in this debate. We would also hope that this would allow . you to achieve a better understanding of the legitimate concern that . your comments has caused within the wider Jewish community. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is accused of not taking anti-Semitism seriously after 'adjourning' Mr Ward's punishment . ‘I am not clear how much time this . work will require although it will involve other people making time . available to work with you and their availability is at present unknown. 'In the circumstances, . therefore, the disciplinary process currently stands adjourned and a . date will require to be fixed at which progress can be reviewed and it . can be concluded.’ Mr . Carmichael added that Mr Clegg wanted it to be understood that the . ‘party recognises your right to express your legitimately and sincerely . held views’ on conditions in which Palestinians live, especially on the . West Bank and in Gaza. He . added: ‘He was equally clear, however, that the language in which these . views are articulated must not be generalised and indiscriminate in its . nature. Liberal Democrats believe in fearless criticism where it is . justified, but abhor generalised condemnation of a whole people where it . is not.’ Karen Pollock, . chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said: ‘This is a . disappointing response to Mr Ward's sickening and unacceptable comments . which he has kept on his website. ‘He . has shown no understanding of the offence he caused in both the . language that he used and the timing of his comments - sadly the . mishandling of this situation appears to demonstrate that Holocaust . equivocation and anti-Semitism are not being taken seriously.’","Bradford East MP condemned for linking Israeli treatment of Palestine with WWII 'death camps'

"A mother-of-three is lucky to be alive after a rare stomach ulcer caused her to vomit up seven pints of blood. Samantha Foxcroft, of Grimsby, Lincolnshire, thought she had contracted a common stomach bug before she started being violently sick, causing her to lose a huge amount of blood. In fact, the 33-year-old had a stomach ulcer which . had eaten through the wall of her stomach and pierced an artery, . leading to extreme bleeding. At first she thought she had picked up a bug from her children who had been unwell. Samantha Foxcroft, pictured with her daughter Georgia, is lucky to be alive after a rare stomach ulcer caused her to vomit up seven pints of blood . But her condition dramatically deteriorated when she rushed to the toilets at work to be sick - and promptly collapsed. She said: 'A co-worker came and discovered blood all over the walls and floor. 'When I woke up I looked down into the toilet bowl and the liquid was bright red. 'It was extremely frightening. All I wanted to do was to be sick again.' The housing association officer was taken to A&E at the Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital in Grimsby where medical staff struggled to understand what was happening to her. She said: 'Nurses held bowl after bowl under my mouth. The blood wouldn’t stop coming. 'It looked as if there had been a bloody massacre around my bed - it was complete chaos. Ms Foxcroft, pictured at Grimsby's Princess of Wales Hospital, fell in and out of consciousness as she was vomiting up blood . 'I fell in and out of consciousness, although I instinctively knew I was dying. 'My first thought was that I had not had the chance to say goodbye to my three children. 'The medics were hand-pumping units of blood into me as fast as I was vomiting the blood out. 'At first no-one knew what the matter was. By the time I was taken for exploratory surgery I’d lost more than four litres of blood.' It was later revealed that she had a stomach ulcer which had penetrated the wall of her stomach. It is rare for someone her age to experience such a condition. She said: 'The doctor told me that he had never seen someone lose so much blood and survive. 'He said I was lucky not to have died. 'If I had started being sick half an hour later, I would have been in the car. 'I would have no option other than to pull over to the side of the road and slump. If I had been on my own, I wouldn’t be here today.' Following the episode in October 2012, Ms Foxcroft made a slow recovery on the intensive care ward. For six weeks she was on a drip receiving medication to help rebuild and reinforce her stomach lining. It took her a year to recover fully. Doctors are still unsure whether the ulcer was caused by a chemical reaction - possibly from a course of painkillers she had taken for neck ache that summer - or stress. Ms Foxcroft said: 'Stress can do incredible things to the body. 'I was dealing with a lot of different challenges at the time. I was going through a difficult break up and working three jobs, so things were getting on top of me. 'I’m still very worried about being left anywhere on my own in case it happens again, although I’m very lucky to have a good support network of friends. 'My workplace gave my colleagues the day off work so they could donate blood while I was in hospital.' Samantha Foxcroft, pictured with her children Georgia, nine, Corban, five and James, three, has become a vocal advocate of the blood donation services which saved her life . Ms Foxcroft, who is mother to Georgia, nine, Corban, five and James, three, has now become a vocal advocate of the blood donation services which saved her life. The 33-year-old lost seven pints of blood during her illness, one pint shy of the average amount of blood circulating in a person's body. She said: 'I exhausted the hospital’s blood supply by myself. If people hadn’t made blood donations, I wouldn’t have made it. 'My children are all very keen to help me raise awareness of blood donation too. As a family we’ve come to learn just how important it is. 'I had so many blood transfusions that I have the blood of 12 different people in my veins. I was so happy when everyone at work donated as a gesture of support. 'I can’t thank enough the doctors who saved my life.'

"William Petit and his wife Christine today released a picture of their adorable baby boy William, whose birth heralds a new chapter of happiness for the couple six years after Dr Petit's first wife and daughters were killed in a horrifying home invasion. Christine gave birth to the boy on November 23 at 6.24am - one week earlier than her due date of December 3. The boy was named William Petit III after his father and grandfather. The photo of the adorable, dark-haired boy wearing a blue baby-gro and lying on a blanket, was proudly posted to the Facebook page of Mrs Petit's photography business on Wednesday. It was posted with the message: 'Happiest and sweetest time ever...our new little son, William. So in love!' Scroll down for video . Bundle of joy: William Arthur Petit III was born on November 23 to Christine Petit and her husband Dr William Petit . Hundreds of well-wishers posted comments and shared the photo, to which Mrs Petit responded: 'Thank you! Over the moon, he's so chill too. Eats like a champ.' Baby William brings happy news for Dr Petit whose first wife Jennifer and two daughters, 17-year-old Hayley and 11-year-old Michaela, were raped and murdered in a horrific attack at the family's Connecticut home in 2007. The family was held hostage for hours . at their Cheshire home before it was set alight by Steven Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky. Dr Petit . was severely beaten and dumped in the basement but managed to escape. Dr Petit and Christine Paluf met at the doctor's local country club, when the professional photographer offered to volunteer for the Petit Family Foundation, which was created in the memory of his late wife and daughters. The doctor and Christine announced shortly before their first wedding anniversary . on August 5 that they were expecting a child. When . local news station WFSB interviewed the couple before the birth, Petit . said he was very excited about the prospect of a new baby and ready to . start changing diapers again. Responding to the reporter's question . about starting a family again, Dr Petit turned somber, saying ‘children . are always your jewels'. ‘Children . are the hope for the future,’ he said with a catch in his throat, . adding that most parents aim to teach children how to be good people and . help others.

Petit met Christine at a local . country club in 2008, where she worked as a marketing director. After . they got chatting, she offered her professional photography services to . the foundation. In . April, she released pictures of their new home and life together and . explained how they have found peace in Western Connecticut. When the killers went on trial in . 2011, Christine was there for Petit, sitting behind him in the . courthouse along with his relatives and listening to hours of agonizing . testimony. Last year they got married and moved into a small but cozy home in Farmington River in western Connecticut.

Horror: An image shown to the court shows the charred bedroom of Hayley Petit after the attack . Dr Petit retired from practicing medicine after the horrific incident and has now dedicated his life to the foundation. He has been approached about running for Congress and told reporters he was considering it after having talks with Republican Party officials. He is continually touched by those who have reached out to him and donated their money, time and kindness. After the home invasion, 25,000 pieces of mail came from all over the world. Some sent money for the foundation, a dollar bill, a $5,000 check, a handwritten note, a card. They were all answered, even when there were no return addresses, the Petits found them. The donations still come in. Among one of William's favorites, according to Esquire magazine, are from three little brothers who, every year at their birthday parties, ask friends to make a donation to the foundation instead of buying a present. William thinks people understand the mission statement - to foster the education of young people, especially women in the sciences, to improve the lives of those affected by chronic illnesses and to support efforts to protect and help those affected by violence. The house burned down beyond any salvation, the building and its foundation had to be razed and carted away. Residents of the affluent cul-de-sac turned it into a memorial garden - though William never goes there.
