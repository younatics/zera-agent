Tragic: Sean Turner, aged three, on holiday in Spain, in August 2011, just before his fourth birthday . A senior nurse in charge of a 'shambolic' ward has admitted she cannot remember any events before a young boy almost died from a heart attack. Sue Connor, who works at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, also told an inquest into the death of four-year-old Sean Turner she did not know whether she removed a tube administering fluid to the four-year-old. The tube had become infected so it was removed and replaced but he died a month later from a brain haemorrhage. His parents allege that the poor standard of nursing on the ward 'contributed to his death'. Sean . suffered the heart attack shortly after the line - which had become . infected - was removed and replaced. Mrs Connor said she believes colleagues who say she was there, but Sean's parents Steve, 47 and Yolanda, 45, claim she was not. Hospital protocol states that two nurses must carry out the procedure while the patient is lying down. But . according to Mr and Mrs Turner, from Warminster, Wiltshire, Sean was . sitting in his father's lap while the procedure carried out. Yesterday . the inquest heard that during his time on Ward 32 Sean had become so . dehydrated that he sucked on wet wipes for the moisture. It . was also claimed that doctors missed a series of warning signs, . including continuous vomiting, a high loss of fluid, huge blood clots . and high blood pressure. Hopeful: Sean, from Warminster, in Wiltshire, excitedly told friends that doctors were going to 'mend his heart' Care: Sean, shown here on holiday in Spain, died in part due to poor nursing, according to his parents . Speaking to the inquest about the removal of the line, Mrs Conner said:'I can’t recall anything from that so I don’t know if I was involved in the removal of the line of not. 'But if someone says I was involved then I believe them. 'I . don’t think I could forget and I don’t think I could remember because I . take out quite a few of those lines during the course of my work.' Condition: Sean suffered from heart complications after being born with the organ in the wrong side of his chest . When . it became infected on February 16 doctors made the decision to remove . and replace the line - but just 15 minutes later Sean suffered a heart . attack. Dehydration: His parents say that at one point Sean was sucking on tissues meant to cool his head in order to rehydrate himself . Mr Turner shook his head in disbelief as Mrs Conner insisted she was present at the removal - something he denies. 'I cannot recall being involved in the removal on the femoral line but I cannot say I was not either,' she said. 'I . cannot recollect at all what happened. A femoral line can be taken out . by just one nurse but it is usual that there are two people that do it.' Adam . Korn, acting for the family, asked Mrs Conner why Mr Turner’s version . of events was different and why he remembered only one nurse taking out . the line. He said: 'If that is right, that would be in breach of protocol... would it not?' She . replied: 'You could take a femoral line out in a parent’s lap because . we don’t know if the child was sat up at times or laid flat at times.' Diane Barlow, another nurse on the ward, also gave her version of events, in which she admitted failing to create a seal in a chest drain on the first attempt. She said: 'When changing the chest line I accept I made a mistake, I forgot to put the water in to create a seal and when I clamped it and looked down to check that the seal had been made I noticed the water was not there.' Mrs . Barlow also told the court she had assisted by Mrs Conner in removing . the femoral line, although conceded no notes had been made on Sean’s . charts to document this. Grief: Yolanda Turner, 45 and her husband Steve, 47, who spoke yesterday at the inquest . 'Dad was distracting Sean and stood next to him, I was holding his legs so he was still while Sue took the line out,' Mrs Barlow added. The . inquest also heard from the doctor in charge of Sean, Guido Pieles, who . said he 'did not have time' to supervise the procedure. Dr Pieles said he had told the nurses to remove the line, but was not there at the time. 'I was not present during the whole of the procedure,' he said. Remembering: Mr and Mrs Turner hold a photograph of their son in their Wiltshire home . Harrowing: Mr and Mrs Turner gave an account to the inquest of watching their son worsen and die . 'I had gone to the nurses' station and I would have come back to check on Sean. 'There . was clearly a deterioration in Sean’s condition... it was a busy time. I . had to talk to my colleagues, arrange blood tests and arrange his care. 'I did not have the time to spend in detail at Sean’s bedside. 'My role was to delegate tasks and oversee tasks and to delegate. I would have not been present at the bedside.' Inquest: Mr and Mrs Turner arriving yesterday at court for the inquest . Sean was born with his heart on the wrong side of his body and blocked arteries between his heart and lungs. He underwent elective Fontan surgery - designed to help his heart work more efficiently - on January 24, 2012. He . was moved out of the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) after just . 18 hours when nurses told his parents his bed was needed and he was passed . between Ward 32 and PICU following other surgery. Sean died of a brain haemorrhage, after suffering multiple blood clots, on March 15, 2012. The inquest continues.","Sue Connor runs Ward 32 at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children .

A trucker died in his bedroom after inhaling gas used in auto-erotic asphyxiation, an inquest heard. Andrew Greenough, 59, was found slumped in his chair by his wife Susan at their home in Reading, Berkshire. He was wearing a rubber suit and a mask, while cylinders of gas were discovered by his side. Victim: Andrew Greenough was found slumped in his chair by wife Susan at their home in Reading, Berkshire . Mrs Greenough - who slept in a separate bedroom - had spoken to her husband of 36 years before leaving for work in October last year, the inquest in Reading heard. However, she later discovered her partner's body when she returned home at about 3.30pm. Today, she told the inquest she had been aware of Mr Greenough's misuse of a particular type of gas - a known substance used in auto-erotic asphyxiation - and had told him to stop using it. 'He was aware it did carry risks, but he was prepared to keep doing it,' she said in a statement paraphrased by coroner Peter Bedford. Discovery: He was wearing a rubber suit and a mask, an inquest at Reading Civic Centre (pictured) heard . A post-mortem examination found Mr Greenough had died suddenly, with blood vessel . haemorrhages around his mouth and nose - both of which are common in asphyxia. Pathologist . Dr Fawaz Musa also discovered fluid in his lungs and an enlarged heart, which Mr Bedford said was 'in keeping with hypertension'. However, Dr Musa said could not be certain whether Mr Greenough had died as a . result of asphyxia or a sudden cardiac arrest brought on by inhaling . the gas. Recording a verdict of death by misadventure, Mr Bedford ruled the trucker had had no intention of taking his own life while performing a 'potentially hazardous' act. He added that he had not heard any evidence that Mr Greenough was performing the extreme sex act when he died. 'No-one is suggesting for a moment this was an intentional act with the purpose of ending Mr Greenoughâ€™s life,' he said. 'He has done something potentially hazardous without the intention of harming himself, but tragically it has. 'The conclusion I record is simply one of misadventure.'","Andrew Greenough, 59, was found dead by wife Susan at home in Reading .

Not keeping a low profile: Part of the conditions for disability filings meant that the individuals did not have full time jobs like Louis Hurtado clearly does, owning a karate center in Florida . A 60-year-old mixed-martial arts teacher was called 'one of the most flagrant' scammers in a  $400million pension-fraud scheme as he appeared in Manhattan court Monday for arraignment. Retired Queens police officer Louis Hurtado collected $470,395.20 over 26 years, the most money over the longest period of time accoring to prosecutors. Assistant District Attorney Christopher Santora said Hurtado was one of the worst abusers, posting videos of himself performing martial arts on YouTube and traveling on at least 18 flights between 2006 and 2013 all while claiming he was too depressed to leave his house, travel or work. Hurtado was extradited from his home . of Pasco, Florida where he owns V.I.P Karate and lives in an upscale . gated neighborhood called 'The Champions Club'. While the 16 other defendants were . processed in groups of three and four and released without bail, Hurtado . was singled out and had to post $20,000 to walk. A lead instructor at his martial arts school was shocked to hear of Hurtado's arrest, describing him as a 'very honest person'. Having his cake and eating it too: Hurtado also brought a home $470,395 illegally from Social Security payouts . Luxury: Hurtado was arrested at his home in an upscale gated Florida community last week . 'It's having an effect on me as his student, as a man, as a father, as a human being. It's tremendously devastating at this moment,' instructor Joseph Mentor told ABC Action News. Hurtado, who is called 'Shidoshi' at the school', boasts on the website that he is a sixth degree black belt who has served as a body guard for 'numerous dignitaries and celebrities' including Sean Connery, James Caan, Elliott Gould, Audrey Hepburn and Tony Orlando. He says that his program has a positive influence on children and he takes pride in 'training and developing tomorrow's leaders, on Black Belt at a time!' While claiming disability, Hurtado brazenly appeared in videos online performing martial arts. In one video, he fights off opponents with 'Danger Zone' blasting in the background. He also posted on his Facebook about looking forward to his 115 precinct reunion, which is scheduled to take place on a cruise this May. Following the charges, he may no longer be welcome to that reunion. Well enough to fight: Hurtado (in black) brazenly performed in marital arts performances while claiming thousands of dollars in disability insurance . Devastating: Joseph Mentor, a lead instructor at the martial arts facility owned by Hurtado, says he was shocked to hear of his boss's arrest . Resume: On the karate school's website, Hurtado boasts of serving as a body guard for celebrities like Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn . More than 100 first responders who . claimed to have psychiatric conditions and medical disorders because of . their work at Ground Zero were arrested last week for disability fraud. Some of the retired police officers, . firefighters and corrections officers stole money from the 9/11 . disability fund, while others like Hurtado had been stealing money from . the pension fund for more than two decades. The . arrests come after the Manhattan District Attorney's office spent more . than two years investigating the claims made by some NYPD officers and . firemen who were part of the September 11 response and clean up efforts. The officers submitted . forms saying that they had varying disorders like PTSD, anxiety or . depression- claims which were discovered to have falsified. ABC 7 reports . that many of the retired officers that had said that they were being . treated for stress retained their gun licenses, which is not allowed if . the holder has such a condition. Another . tip off was that in order to receive the benefits, the individuals had . to be fully retired and while the majority of them had retired from the . New York police and fire departments, many had taken up a second job. Investigators . used photos on Facebook as evidence that the men have taken up jobs . ranging from martial arts instructors to helicopter pilots. Some photos directly contradicted specific parts of the disorders that the responding officers claimed to have. Tag team: John Minerva (left), a Detectives Endowment Association consultant, or Joseph Esposito (right), a retired member of the NYPD, would refer the fraudsters to one of two lawyers who were in on the scheme . Law on their side: Raymond Lavallee, 83, was one of those two lawyers who then helped process the legal papers which allowed the schemers to get on average between $30,000 and $50,000 per year- with a nice cut for each of the ringleaders . Responding to horror: More than a hundred first responders who helped at Ground Zero following the 2001 terrorist attack are being arrested over disability fraud after making false claims of PTSD and depression . Sending a message: Glenn Lieberman is pictured on a jet ski, clearly not as incapacitated as he claimed to be in his benefit filing . Proud: Shannon Tumminello, 42, now lives in Lee, Florida but was claiming disability insurance from the fund . Not so afraid of crowds now: Joseph Morrone, who said his post-9/11 fear of crowds kept him from working, collected $108,930 in payments and is seen here selling cannolis at the packed San Gennaro festival . The individuals' claims- whether they be . depression or assertions that they felt unable to spend time with family . and friends in social settings- have not been revealed- but the . District Attorney's office released a set of photos that depict some of . the men in question having a great time on jet skis or marlin fishing as . examples of their fraudulent claims. One instance came from an officer, . whose name has not been released, that told authorities that his work . after the September 11th attacks left him with a  debilitating fear of . crowds. On Facebook, he was pictured selling canollis at the crowded San . Gennaro festival in Little Italy. The suspicion is that there were a . handful of 'crooked' lawyers and doctors who worked with the responders . in question and were fully aware of how to 'game the system'. The four alleged 'ringleaders' were . identified first, and it is clear that their positions within the NYPD . and background in legal work helped them evade capture for years. Moving up north: Unlike many of the fraudsters who retired to Florida, Rich Cosentino moved to New Hampshire, but that doesn't put him out of the scope of the Manhattan District Attorney . Active: Rich Cosentino collected a total of $207639 since May 2008 . Participants . would start out by contacting John Minerva, 61, a Detectives Endowment . Association consultant, or Joseph Esposito, 64, a retired member of the . NYPD. Minerva or Esposito would then refer the . fraudsters to one of two lawyers who were in on the scheme- Thomas Hale, . 89, and former FBI agent Raymond Lavallee, 83. All four are charged with first and second degree grand larceny. The 9/11 disability claims are not the . first that the four men have had a hand in, as ABC reports that they are . believed to have been running disability scams since 1988. 'My client's involvement in this scheme was minimal at best... he maintains his innocence,' Minerva's lawyer Glenn Hardy told The New York Daily News. The lawyers put the schemers in touch with two different doctors- but not after some coaching. The district attorney laid out a series of different trigger phrases that would help justify an anxiety condition prescription. They range from 'I nap on and off during the day' to 'my (family member) is always after me about my grooming'. Not hurting too badly: John Famularo, 58, lives in Nassau, New York and his alleged disabilities- which have not been specifically disclosed- should have prevented him from motorcycling but he proudly posted this to Facebook . Throwback: Famularo had no qualms about posting this old picture of him in uniform online, and he was far from the only 'boy in blue' that was involved in the scheme . Other possible additions included the lamentation that they were 'healthy, active, productive' people but no longer. 'They're . liable to say... spell the word ""world,"" so you go ""W-R-L-D."" Then . they're gonna say ""Spell it backwards."" You think about it, and you . can't spell it backwards,""' court papers report that Esposito said in a recording. All told, the fraudulent claims cost $24.5million in taxpayer-funded benefits. 'For years, federal taxpayers have unwittingly financed the lifestyles of the defendants charged today,' district attorney Cy Vance said in a statement which listed all of the 106 accused. Busted: Mike Scialabba collected $232,443 from the fund but also broke the rules by working as a helicopter pilot- a job which would be extremely difficult should he actually have the condition he claimed to suffer from . 'Many participants cynically manufactured claims of mental illness as a result of September 11th, dishonoring the first responders who did serve their City at the expense of their own health and safety. This alleged scam further depleted the already limited resources available for battling the real and complex conditions of PTSD and depression.' The case is the biggest bust that was announced since the new Mayor, Bill de Blasio, and his team has been in office, making this the first time in his recent tenure that new police commissioner William Bratton has weighed in on the work of the DA's office. 'The retired members of the NYPD indicted in this case have disgraced all first responders who perished during the search and rescue efforts on September 11, 2001, and those who subsequently died from 9/11 related illness, by exploiting their involvements that tragic day for personal gain,' Bratton said in the statement.","Louis Hurtado, 60, is one of dozens of retired NYPD officers who claimed to have a debilitating disorder that stopped him from working .

Revealed: The first picture of the captain's cabin on the sunken Costa Concordia where Francesco Schettino reportedly held 2am trysts with a Moldovan dancer before the ship crashed, killing 32 people on board . Late-night trysts: Married Francesco Schettino (left), who is currently on trial for multiple manslaughter and abandoning ship, is said to have entertained Domnica Cemortan (right) on several occasions in his room . The cruise liner was carrying more than 4,000 passengers and crew when it sank off the island of Giglio in January 2012. Ms .

'I would make my way to his cabin in the middle of the night. It was all very secretive. 'I had to make sure no one saw me,' Ms Cemortan, a single mother of one, told The Sun in November. Trashed: A new image has also emerged of one of the restaurant areas on the Concordia after it crashed . She was with Schettino and other officers on the bridge when the crash sirens went off. Prosecutors claim her presence was a distraction to Schettino, but she says she was more than 150ft away from him at the time of the crash. She admits they shared a meal and passionately kissed on the night the ship sank, but says they did not have sex. Miss Cemortan, who worked as a guide and translator for Russian tourists, also denied that their late night trysts made Schettino tired when on shift. She said: 'He is not stupid.

A German man accused of choking his 91-year-old socialite wife to death in the United States described their relationship as 'a marriage of convenience', a court has heard. In an audio tape of a police interview played to jurors on Monday, Albrecht Muth, 49, explained that he hadn't bothered trying to resuscitate elderly Viola Drath in the bathroom of their home in Georgetown, Washington D.C because 'the obvious was obvious'. Muth, who is considered too ill to attend court after repeat periods of fasting for what he claims are 'religious reasons', has been charged with first-degree murder over the August 2011 beating and strangulation death of German-born Drath and faces life in prison if convicted. Victim: German socialite Viola Drath was found beaten and strangled to death. Jurors were today show gruesome crime scene images of lying dead on a bed with a wound on her neck . The interview, recorded in a cramped police interrogation room in the days between the discovery of Drath's body and her husband's arrest, gave jurors their closest look yet at the defendant. Muth has been absent from the trial, participating passively through video conference, after doctors said his self-imposed starvation made him too weak to appear in court. The case is expected to go to the jury later this week. Accused: Muth is charged with first-degree murder and could face life in prison if convicted . Muth's lawyers say he's innocent and that there's no evidence he killed . his wife. Prosecutors, meanwhile, say Muth lived off a monthly allowance . from his wife that had recently been reduced and that he killed Drath . in hopes of collecting a portion of her estate. In video shown to . jurors, detectives asked Muth to walk them through the discovery of . Drath's body but didn't ask whether he had anything to do with her . death. When one of the detectives noted the large age difference and . asked whether the couple was intimate, Muth replies, 'We had a marriage . of convenience.' Muth called police early on August 12, 2011, to . report finding his wife dead in a third-floor bathroom of their home in . Georgetown, an expensive Washington D.C. neighborhood. Investigators initially . treated the death as one of natural causes but settled on Muth as the . suspect after finding no signs of forced entry and determining he and . Drath were the only ones home at the time she died. A crime scene . technician testified on Monday that none of the home's windows had been . opened. Another investigator said he found internet searches on Muth's . laptop computer for flights to Iceland, crossing the Canadian border, . extradition arrangements with Mexico and challenging a prenuptial . agreement. Latoya Jamison, a forensic investigator with . the D.C. medical examiner's office, said Muth appeared anxious and . fidgety but otherwise emotionless after she came to the home to take . photographs and inspect the body. She said he seemed especially curious . to know the cause of death and whether any trauma was found that could . explain it. One of Drath's daughters testified that Muth told her that . her mother had been having balance problems, but she said that surprised . her since her mother had been in excellent physical health. Chic home: The investigation began after Muth reported finding 91-year-old Viola Drath's body in the bathroom of their home in Georgetown, Washington . With . Drath's daughters and other relatives present in the courtroom, . prosecutors presented photographs of Drath sprawled dead on the bathroom . floor. A large, bloody gash covered her neck, another wound was found . on the back of her neck and a fingernail had nearly been ripped off, . Jamison said. She said the position of Drath's body struck her as . peculiar for someone who would have died from a fall - as Muth had . maintained - or of natural causes. She said it appeared likely that . Drath had died somewhere else in the house and then been placed in the . bathroom, which prosecutors contend is what happened. One of Drath's daughters, Connie Drath Dwyer, testified that Muth had begun pressuring her mother for money. She . recalled how he wore an eye patch the first time they met, saying he . had lost his eye to injury and made reference to having been a mercenary . soldier in South America. She said she never again saw him with a patch . and never noticed problems with his eye. Prosecutors contend the . patch was part of a web of elaborate fictions that Muth spun about his . professional career and connections. He had claimed to be a brigadier . general with the Iraqi army, but the military uniform he would wear . around the neighborhood was actually purchased and that he had no . authentic army connections.","Albrecht Muth, 49, is accused of murdering Viola Drath in their bathroom .

Costly: A bus driver forced Megan Harris, 11, to buy an adult bus ticket as she could not prove she was under 16 . An 11-year-old schoolgirl was forced to spend her lunch-money on an adult bus ticket because she could not prove she was under 16. Megan Harris was trying to buy a £7 child’s weekly pass on her way to school in York, which she is entitled to because she is under 16. However, the driver from company First insisted she prove she was the correct age, despite the fact she was wearing her school uniform. When Megan had nothing to show how old she was the driver told her she would have to buy an adult ticket costing her £5 extra and leaving her with no lunch money for the day. Year 7 pupil Megan, instead returned home hungry that evening. Her dad Steve, 45, is now sending her to school with her passport to prove her age. Mr Harris, who runs a minibus hire company with 45-year-old wife Janine, said: 'Megan’s bought a child’s ticket every day since she started at the school, she’s never had a problem like this before. 'Obviously the bus driver was just having a bad day - the bus company have said it’s up to a driver’s discretion to judge a child’s age. 'I can kind of see their point if it’s a pupil who’s 15 or 16, perhaps they could look like an adult, but Megan is by no means tall for her age. 'She looks very young, she’s only in the first year of secondary school, and she was wearing a school uniform. It’s absolutely unbelievable.' Father-of-four Mr Harris added: 'The first thing I knew about it was when she came home from school and made herself a sandwich, she was clearly starving.

Landmark case: Aja Riggs, of Santa Fe, New Mexico, challenged a decades-old state law that prohibits assisted suicide . Terminally ill patients who are competent have a fundamental right to get a doctor's help to end their lives under New Mexico's constitution, a judge has ruled. Second Judicial District Judge Nan Nash said the constitution banned the state from depriving a person of life, liberty or property without due process. 'This court cannot envision a right more fundamental, more private or more integral to the liberty, safety and happiness of a New Mexican than the right of a competent, terminally ill patient to choose aid in dying,' she wrote. Judge Nash also ruled that doctors . could not be prosecuted under the state's assisted suicide law, which . classifies helping with suicide as a fourth-degree felony. The plaintiffs in the case do not consider physicians aiding in dying a form of suicide. The . judge's decision followed a two-day trial in December in which two . doctors and a Santa Fe woman with advanced uterine cancer asked the . judge to determine physicians would not be breaking the law if they . wrote prescriptions for competent, terminally ill patients who wanted to . end their lives. Doctors Katherine Morris and Aroop Mangalik and patient Aja Riggs initially filed their lawsuit in March 2012. The . lawsuit had the support of the American Civil Liberties Union of New . Mexico, Denver-based Compassion & Choices and the New Mexico . Psychological Association, the largest organisation of professional . psychologists in the state. The psychologists' group argued that . assisted suicide and 'aid in dying' for terminally ill patients were . fundamentally different. Ms Riggs, 49, who has undergone . aggressive radiation and chemotherapy, said in December that her cancer . was in remission but there had been days when getting out of bed and . walking 15ft were an uphill battle. She . said she wanted to live, but also wanted the option of dying if her . condition worsened. 'I don't want to suffer needlessly at the end,' she . told Judge Nash. A judge in New Mexico has ruled that patients have a right to ask doctor to help end their lives . Kathryn Tucker, director of legal affairs for Compassion & Choices, has said there is growing support for doctorss to help terminally ill patients who want to end their lives. Five US states, including Oregon, allow patients to seek aid in dying if their conditions become unbearable, she said. The New Mexico Conference of Catholic Bishops was disappointed with Monday's ruling, saying there's a difference between fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitution and the ability of someone to take a person's life. Opinions can differ with regard to the survivability of illnesses, and medical treatments can progress, said Allen Sanchez, executive director of the bishops' group. 'As long as there is a chance for human error, we can't have that. You can never reverse the decision you've made. It's the finality of it,' Sanchez said. 'If we are not willing to give that ability to a judge and jury by doing away with the death penalty in New Mexico, we should not be willing to give one doctor and two witnesses that ability.'","Judge Nan Nash said the constitution bans state from stopping them .

A U.S. state is looking to extend its requirement that gun buyers . undergo background checks and register their weapons to anyone who . assembles a firearm in their home. The legislation by California state Senator Kevin de Leon is part of a growing effort across the country to pre-empt the spread of undetectable guns that can be made using 3-D printers. His bill would also apply to anyone who buys parts that can be assembled into a gun. Invisible killers: California State Senator Kevin de Leon (holding a homemade automatic rifle) has introduced a bill that would require anyone who assembles so-called 'ghost guns' at home to undergo background checks . 'No one knows they exist until after a crime has been committed': De Leon's bill would also apply to anyone who buys parts that can be assembled into a gun . De Leon said he is trying to address a twin threat from what he called 'ghost guns' - plastic weapons that can slip through metal detectors and unregistered weapons that can fall into the hands of people who are prohibited from owning firearms under state law. 'Currently, no one knows they exist until after a crime has been committed,' said de Leon, a leading candidate to take over as Senate leader next year. That was the case for John Zawahri, who assembled his own military-style assault rifle and killed five people in Santa Monica in a June rampage even after he was barred from legally buying a gun in California because of mental health issues. The bill by De Leon, a Democrat from Los Angeles, goes further than the federal government, which last month renewed for 10 years an existing ban on plastic firearms that can evade metal detectors and X-ray machines. His bill, SB808, would allow the manufacture or assembly of homemade weapons, but require the makers to first apply to the state Department of Justice for a serial number that would be given only after the applicants undergo a background check. Moving targets: The bill goes further than the one passed by the Senate last month (above) which gave a 10-year extension to the prohibition against guns that can slip past metal detectors and X-ray machines . The number would have to be engraved on or otherwise permanently attached to the weapon within one day of its manufacture. He plans to amend the bill to also require that the guns contain permanent pieces of metal that could be detected by X-ray machines and metal detectors, a proposal that was blocked in the federal legislation. Some plastic guns currently comply with the federal law by including a metal piece that can be removed, which potentially would allow them to be slipped through security screeners at airports, courthouses, schools and elsewhere. The National Rifle Association did not oppose the 10-year extension of the federal plastic firearms ban. Clamping down: The bill comes after John Zawahri (pictured) killed five people in Santa Monica with a military-style assault rifle he assembled himself in a June rampage . But spokesman Catherine Mortensen said the organization opposes any expansion of the law at either the federal or state level. Currently available technology allows consumers to download a gun's design plans to a computer and then build it on a three-dimensional printer with no background checks or other safeguards. Lawmakers in New Jersey and New York have introduced legislation that would ban the possession of weapons made using 3-D printers, said National Conference of State Legislatures policy specialist Jon Griffin. However, while there had been talk by federal lawmakers and some state legislators of trying to restrict the posting of weapons plans on the Internet, Griffin said he knows of no such legislation being introduced and said it would likely run into free speech protections. Nick Wilcox, representing the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, said de Leon's bill is particularly significant because as of January 1, those buying rifles and shotguns in California are required to undergo the same registration and background checks as are required of those buying handguns. California is also the only state that cross-checks five computerized databases to find people who bought firearms but are not permitted to own them. Brian Michael Jenkins, who once served on the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security and as an adviser to the National Commission on Terrorism, is skeptical that new three-dimensional printing technology will lead to a flood of undetectable weapons, if only because it is simpler and cheaper to buy a traditional handgun. Shooting: This photo shows the self-made assault rifle used by Zawahri, who was barred from legally buying a gun in California because of mental health issues . Moreover, new airport body scanners and X-ray machines can spot the outline of a gun even if it is made from plastic. However, proposals like de Leon's have merit because they provide another tool to law enforcement, said Jenkins, a senior adviser to the president of the RAND Corp. think tank. De Leon's bill would make violations misdemeanors punishable with a fine of up to $1,000 and up to a year in jail for an illegal handgun, up to six months for a rifle or shotgun. 'As we come up with new types of technology, it creates new vulnerabilities,' said Jenkins, who has written extensively on terrorism-related issues. 'What you have then is an ongoing dynamic between bad guys and good guys.'","Bill by Senator Kevin de Leon aims to halt spread of undetectable weapons .

Jennifer Marley, 53, was paid to visit and look after Mavis Pately, 79, but began helping herself to cash that was left lying around her home. The elderly woman's family became suspicious and installed security cameras in the property, which captured Marley rummaging through drawers, looking for money. Scroll down for video .

She stole more than £1,000 from the frail pensioner and has now been convicted of two counts of theft at Plymouth Crown Court. Former nurse Mavis has since died and her family say the shock of watching the CCTV footage upset her so much it 'put her in the ground'. Mrs Pately's children believe their . mother’s shock in finding that her trusted carer was a thief contributed . to her death months later. Guilty: Marley was convicted of two counts of theft at Plymouth Crown Court . Speaking after the case Mrs Pately's son Gary McKinnon branded Marley the 'scum of the Earth'. He said: 'She was in shock when she saw the CCTV. 'She was never the same again. It helped put my mother in the ground. 'At least now she can rest in peace. 'My mother trusted her and liked her. She did not want it to be her. It knocked her for six.' Marley was arrested after the CCTV captured her stealing an envelope containing £1,000 in cash and taking another containing fake notes - set up by Mrs Pately's children. The carer was seen rummaging through a drawer on two occasions on successive days and taking something from the unit a few days later. Marley, who had helped Mrs Patey for six months, was so trusted by the pensioner that she asked her to become her preferred carer and take over visits from others. Marley denied one charge of stealing an envelope containing £1,000 between September and November 2012. She pleaded not guilty to attempted theft of more cash - which turned out to be the envelope containing plain paper. But a jury found her guilty of both counts and she will be sentenced at a later date. She was acquitted of the theft of two further envelopes containing £1,000, which the family say disappeared earlier from the same drawer. Concerned: Mrs Pately's family had installed the video devices after becoming suspicious off Marley's behaviour . Judge Paul Darlow released Marley on bail last Friday pending a probation report, but warned that she could be sent to jail. Marley has resigned from the agency First Call where she had worked since 2003. She returned the £1,000 but the family believe £2,000 is still missing.

Dustin Friedland, 30, was fatally wounded by a gunshot to his head when two men approached him and his wife after an evening of Christmas shopping and demanded the keys to his 2012 silver Range Rover at gunpoint.

Millburn Police Chief Gregory Weber has said the ambulance actually arrived at the mall 18 minutes after the shooting, but the vehicle had trouble getting to the crime scene because it could not fit below a low ceiling at the entrance to the parking deck. Eventually, emergency crews wheeled a stretcher up the entrance ramp to the level of the parking deck where Friedland was shot, Weber said.

He would run to make sure he opened for car door for me. There wasn’t a bag anyone ever carried that Dustin didn’t help with.’ ‘Dustin always did the right thing,’ she added. The last of six speakers during the service, Jamie told mourners that despite her loss, ‘I’m truly the luckiest person I know, and I still believe that because I married the best man in the entire world.’ ‘I was lucky enough to be with him in the time we had,’ she said. The couple, who married in 2011,  had been hoping to start a family before the tragic incident. ‘There was not a better person, a better soul, in the entire world. He was my entire world and my happiness was the most important thing to him, always.’ ‘He was kind, generous, giving, smart, loving, loyal, just the best person you ever met,’ she added. ‘Dustin, I love you more than anything in the entire multiverse,’ she said, standing just feet from the closed casket. ‘You are my everything, my hero. And I’m so proud to have known you, loved you and married you.’ Friedman's silver Range Rover was recovered in Newark the morning after the attack on December 15 . Dustin was shot in the head on Sunday night in front of his wife in the parking garage of The Mall At Short Hills, about 10 miles west of Newark, after being confronted by two carjackers.

A cash-strapped council has launched a cut-price bid to stop sand being blown away from a popular beach - by covering it with Christmas trees. Officials at Cornwall Council came up with the festive solution after locals complained Porthtowan Beach was being eroded by high winds. The authority asked residents to donate their old trees then planted them in several rows across the dunes. Parish Councillor Tony Child helps plant Christmas trees on the beach to try and stabilize the sand dunes which have been blown away . Dozens of Christmas trees have been buried on a Cornish beach in a scheme to prevent erosion . They say the pines will act as a temporary wind break and provide shelter which will allow marram grass to grow across the sand. Grass roots will then bind the dunes together and the trees will eventually be removed. The council has attempted to manage the dunes in the past by putting up fencing and pathways but says Christmas trees provide a cheap, environmentally friendly alternative. Councillor Joyce Duffin said: 'The dunes are an important part of the beach environment providing coastal defences and a habitat for a variety of insects, small mammals and birds. The project, which has met strong opposition from Porthtowan Dunes Group, aims to capture the wind to allow the marram grass to grow and hold the sand togethe . Cornwall Council, which launched the tree planning, said residents would see a difference within a year as the sand dunes took shape . The council has attempted to manage the dunes in the past by putting up fencing and pathways but says Christmas trees provide a cheap, environmentally friendly solution . 'They are also used by many people for a range of recreational activities and while it's fantastic to see the area is well used and appreciated, unfortunately, over time, these activities have damaged the dune. 'A sustainable way of protecting the dune is to use natural materials to limit sand movement and we hope the trees will be the first step in stabilising the area.' The plan has split opinion in the coastal village, where residents say the winds whip up sand storms and damage their homes.

Chris Smith, local businessman and a member of the Dune Management Group, dismissed it as a 'crack-pot idea' and called for proper investment in sand defences. He said: 'We have toyed with this issue for years and we have seen the sand dunes get out of control. 'Consequently there is no sand on the beach as it has spread on to the green and the road. 'Due to a European directive, much of the sand blown on to the nearby green and road has to been taken to a landfill site rather than being returned to the beach. 'The beach is literally being carried away and dumped inland, and this tree burying idea is just another crack-pot idea from the council.'","Council says pines will act as a temporary wind break and provide shelter .

For wine aficionados lacking a corkscrew - or jokers looking for a new party trick - comes the latest innovation sure to blow your top off. Stephen Cronk from Mirabeau Wine in Provence has released a new video which shows how to open a bottle of vino without a corkscrew. All you need is a shoe, a wall and a thirst for the grape. Scroll down for video . No corkscrew? No worries: A Mirabeau Wines expert demonstrates how wine lovers can pull a cork out of a bottle using their shoe . Snug fit: After pulling the foil off the top, place the bottom of the bottle snugly in the heel of the shoe. Try to use a shoe with sides that go at least partway up the bottle . First, you have to remove the protective foil - or 'capsule' - covering the top of the bottle. Then you place the bottom of the glassware snugly inside a shoe, preferably footwear a rubber sole to absorb the shock of the ensuing slam. Gripping the bottle and shoe, bang the sole against a wall or tree several times until the cork eases out of the bottle. Then all you have to do is pour. But how does it work? io9.com describes the process of 'cavitation' this way: . 'The bubble of air at the top of the bottle moves to the bottom of the bottle as it gets accelerated backwards. The sudden, hard strike of the bottle against the wall compresses the bubble of air. 'One side of it is being pushed against the glass, the other side has the wine pressing against it. 'The inside volume of the bottle stays the same size, but suddenly the volume of the air bubble plus the volume of the wine is smaller. 'Once the wine has hit the wall and rebounded, the bubbles that have just been created are pushed up against the cork. They burst and push the wine cork up and out of the bottle.' Apparently the uncouth move is popular amongst restaurateurs and sommeliers. But after this video, it's likely to catch on outside the food and beverage industry. Cheers to that! Smack it: Hit the heel of the shoe against a hard vertical surface like a wall or a tree. The shoe will cushion the bottle while the pressure from the blows should force the cork out . Pour forth: After a few hard knocks, the cork will come out far enough that you can just yank it . The grand finale: The cork should be pushed out far enough to enable you to yank it .

An animal shelter has banned members of the public from looking at its dogs, claiming that large amounts of visitors are 'extremely stressful' and harms their well-being. The rule comes into force next week at the Coco Markus kennels in Godmanchester, Cambridgeshire, run by the charity Wood Green. Visitors to the centre will now have to fill out a form before they can see any dogs, and members of staff will suggest them matches. Ban: Members of the public will no longer be able to visit the dogs at Wood Green shelter in Cambridgeshire without proving their interest in re-homing one of the animals . Welfare: The shelter says its new policy is in line with other animal charities, and was prompted by scientific research . The shelter says this is necessary because many visitors have no intention of adopting a dog, and seeing lots of people can make the dogs less healthy and well-behaved. According to studies of sheltered dogs, excessive visits can lead to the dogs hiding, panting and barking more than usual. This in turn could make them less attractive to those who genuinely want to give them a home. Conclusions: Studies suggest that dogs which are visited excessively are more prone to barking, panting and hiding from their visitors . Linda Cantle, the shelter's head of animal welfare, said that they made the decision because they must put the animals' welfare first. She said: 'We understand that some people will be disappointed by not being able to visit the dogs; however our animals’ welfare is always our overriding priority,' said Linda Cantle, head of animal welfare. 'Research carried out last summer revealed that on average just 15 per cent of the visitors to the kennels were interested in re-homing a dog. 'For dogs, the rescue kennel environment is extremely stressful. We have introduced a number of techniques to reduce the negative effect but we are still seeing a deterioration of behaviour and health in the dogs in our care on a daily basis. 'We are confident managing the number of visitors to the kennel area will significantly improve the welfare of the dogs. Stress levels and the associated negative behaviours will be reduced. 'The improved kennel behaviour will result in enhanced interactions between potential re-homers and the dogs and therefore better and quicker re-homing prospects.' Commenting on the changes of procedure, a . spokesman for the centre said that allowing free access to the dogs was . 'doing them a disservice' and that they have received 'positive' feedback. Needs a home: Research suggests that dogs which are visited too often are less likely to find a home (file photo) Shelter: The Coco Markus Kennels is in Godmanchester, Cambridgeshire . She said: 'Our main aim at Wood Green is to re-home the dogs that have come into our care and to allow them every opportunity to be seen by their potential forever homes'. 'If they are frightened and are hiding because of the volumes of visitors we see their chances lessen in finding a home quickly. We believe we are doing them a disservice to allow this to happen. 'The feedback so far has been positive. We are a nation of animal lovers and we want what is best for the dogs.' One well-wisher, Sonia Reilly, said: 'Well done Linda and Wood Green. This will ensure only genuine adopters view the dogs, and not the hordes of people who clutter up the place using it as a free viewing zoo. 'Kennels are extremely stressful places, and doing this will make the environment a little less stressful for the animals.'","The Coco Markus kennels will bring in the new rule next week .

Three Poles who murdered a British graduate could have their life sentences slashed after foreign courts approved a plea to move them back to their homeland. The trio were each given a minimum of 32 years in jail after they carefully plotted the death of Catherine Wells-Burr, whose body was found in her burnt-out car. But the government is now considering whether Rafal Nowak - who posed as Catherine’s doting boyfriend - and his jealous mistress Anna Lagwinowicz can be deported to Poland. This would mean they could be released seven years earlier because of more lenient Polish sentencing guidelines. Lagwinowicz’s uncle Tadevsz Dmytryszyn - who helped her dispose of Catherine’s body - is also in the process of negotiating a similar deal. Nowak, 31, suffocated Catherine with a pillow as she slept at the home they shared in Chard, Somerset, in September 2012. The body of the 23-year-old was taken in her red Ford Focus to a layby in Ashill a few miles away where his lover Lagwinowicz, 32, and Dmytryszyn, 38, were waiting. They waited until 6am to give Nowak time to get to work before they poured petrol inside the car and set it on fire with Catherine’s body strapped in the driver’s seat. The trio all denied murdering Catherine but were found guilty in June following a seven-week trial at Bristol Crown Court. The government is now considering whether Rafal Nowak - who posed as Catherine's doting boyfriend - and his jealous mistress Anna Lagwinowicz can be deported to Poland . Lagwinowicz's uncle Tadevsz Dmytryszyn helped her dispose of Catherine's body . According to Catherine’s mother Jayne, 47, . Nowak and Lagwinowicz have appealed to the Polish authorities to be . deported so they can serve their sentence - minus seven years - at home. She says the plea has been approved in Poland and the proposal has been passed to the UK authorities to rubber-stamp. It is is currently being considered by the Ministry of Justice. Speaking from her home in Chard, Somerset, Jayne said: 'We just can’t believe they are even having to think about it. 'Nowak and Anna are trying to get back to Poland - I guess the British prisons are just too much for them. 'I am in absolute despair - we are all distraught. If they are successful they will get seven years off. 'These three are highly dangerous people who systematically plotted and planned Catherine’s murder. 'They can move on. We feel like if they are allowed to go back to Poland they are being rewarded. 'They get less time and a fresh start - while we are left with the real life sentence of a life without Catherine. 'If they go over to Poland nobody will know when they come to be released if they are remorseful for their actions. 'They never showed any sorrow and any remorse at all in court. Nowak, 31, suffocated Catherine with a pillow as she slept at the home they shared in Chard, Somerset . 'Over there we will have no say when it comes to parole. Our thoughts will never be taken into consideration. 'I feel we have been let down. The British justice system worked really hard to secure these convictions and this just makes a mockery of them. 'Of course it was never going to bring Catherine back but we felt that that the sentencing reflected a small degree of our loss. 'We knew that in 32 years time they would have to face our loss again in our victim impact statements and it made us feel reassured that Catherine and our loss would not be forgotten in the process. 'But, here they are flouting the system. Catherine's family Leanne Wells-Burr, 21, Jayne Wells-Burr, 46 and Philip Wells-Burr, 48. Her mother, Jayne, says Nowak and Lagwinowicz have appealed to the Polish authorities to be deported . 'We feel we have been let down by our own government because they should not even be considering it. 'For what they have done to us, for the life sentence they have given us, it is outrageous. 'If a crime is done in this country and Catherine is British, why are we letting the Polish do this to us? 'It has made a joke of the sentences and shows we are bowing down to the EU.' Jayne - who has not been contacted by Polish authorities about the appeal - found out when a Polish friend read about the hearings on a website. Evil: Catherine's body was strapped into the driver's seat and the car set alight after she was suffocated . She says the trio would face lighter sentences in their homeland because Polish law does not take into consideration planning and means of disposal of the body when setting tariffs. In a bid to block their deportation, she has written to David Cameron, Theresa May and Secretary of State for Justice Chris Grayling. During the trial, Bristol Crown Court heard Catherine was in a deadly love triangle with two-timing Nowak and Lagwinowicz who despised her. Nowak and Lagwinowicz decided to kill her last September in a bid to grab her six-figure life insurance and share of her house. Before the murder they planted messages trying to suggest that business analyst Catherine, who also worked with Nowak, was having an affair. The killers also created fake profiles for blameless Catherine on sex websites - and even left her car at a notorious ‘dogging’ spot. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: 'We do not comment on individual cases.'","Rafal Nowak, Anna Lagwinowicz and Tadevsz Dmytryszyn were each given a minimum of 32 years in jail for the murder of Catherine Wells-Burr, .

A leading academic wrote an internet diary chronicling her last days before killing herself with drugs she bought online. Former Arts Council of Wales chief Frances Medley, 44, was heartbroken at having . to give up her career after she was struck down by Multiple Sclerosis. In a poignant blog post, Miss Medley referred to her eight-year illness as 'Cruella', after the villain in the film 101 Dalmatians, and gave a parting message to her readers, urging them to 'Live life as though it could be snatched away from you in a heartbeat'. Miss Medley also wrote: 'I am very clear that, whilst the law might say otherwise, I AM NOT COMMITTING SUICIDE.' An inquest into her death heard she left instructions with her closest friends to update her blog explaining why she had 'decided to call it a day'. Miss Medley was found dead at her home after battling Multiple Sclerosis for eight years. Her posthumous blog, in which she referred to herself as 'the Spinster' said: 'The prospect of further rapid deterioration was both terrifying and not one I wanted to entertain. 'I decided to end my life in a manner and at a time of my choosing.' Miss Medley, who was the acting chief executive of the Arts Council in Wales, had kept a blog about her fight against MS. The inquest was told that she had killed herself in her home by taking a banned drug, which she said in a note that she had bought online. Her body was discovered in her home in Barry, South Wales, after neighbours became worried they had not seen her for two days. A post mortem examination showed that her cause of death had been an overdose of the substance. Cardiff Coroner’s Court heard worried neighbours found a note in the front door window saying: 'Do not enter. Please call the police and call my brother Mark.' Officers forced entry and discovered Ms Medley’s body in bed and her 'extremely tidy' house prepared with labels saying what items she wanted people to have. In her final blog post, Miss Medley explained her reasons for ending her life. She said: 'The loss of my independence both financially and physically has been extremely difficult for me. Poignant: In her blog post, Miss Medley referred to her illness as 'Cruella', and gave a parting message to her readers, urging them to 'Live life as though it could be snatched away from you in a heartbeat' 'Without the financial support of my immediate family, I would have had to seek the support of the State. 'Whilst of course I was entitled to resort to this I found the prospect humiliating. Pride is a terrible thing, a real burden at times of need.' In the blog she said the illness had exhausted her emotionally and physically, although in her final post she said she felt she had peaked early in life. 'I don’t leave with rafts of regrets or things I wish I’d done,' she said. 'Happy with my lot is perhaps an exaggeration but had I persisted, my ability to do things would have been daily reduced; my potential it seems has been fulfilled.' Miss Medley even gave advice in her parting message, writing: 'Live life as though it could be snatched away from you in a heartbeat; take managed risks avoiding recklessness; and treat your fellow travellers with tenderness and care. 'Hold your tongue at times when you risk blurting out judgemental potentially hurtful comments; we seldom know the full back story.' Painful: Miss Medley was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2005 and her GP Dr James Martin told the inquest she had suffered a great deal of pain 'which simply got too much for her bear' One of the leading lights of the Welsh arts scene, Miss Medley later became a freelance business consultant for the creative sector and was involved in the National Youth Arts Wales Steering Group and the Magdalena Project, which supports women in theatre and the arts. She was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2005 and her GP Dr James Martin told the inquest she had suffered a great deal of pain 'which simply got too much for her bear'. Coroner Christopher Wooley told the inquest: 'Frances Medley was obviously a very determined lady who did well in her career. 'For eight years she suffered with Multiple Sclerosis which had been worsening. 'Her GP said it was difficult to control Frances’s pain and various therapies were attempted and none were really very effective. 'She was a very strong character and highly intelligent. Her life was beginning to contract and she found the burden hard the bear.' He recorded a verdict that Miss Medley ended her own life, adding: 'She planned it meticulously and left letters to say she wanted to end her life - to end the pain at a time and place of her choosing.' Speaking after the inquest, friend and colleague Gilly Adams said: 'Fran was a remarkable woman who demonstrated great courage and determination. 'She was a very much loved and respected member of the arts community in Wales.' Her brother Mark added: 'She will be sorely missed by everybody.'

Britain's property map: While house prices in London and the South have continued to rise homeowners in other parts of the country are living in negative equity . House prices are rising across the UK but new figures reveal that homeowners in large parts of the country are still trapped in negative equity. The latest study from the Office for National Statistics shows the property boom is continuing, with the average house increasing in value by 5.4 per cent over the last year to £248,000, largely driven by prices surging in London. However, the average cost of a house in other regions including the North East, North West and most notably Northern Ireland, are below their values at the time of the financial crash of 2008. The figures could reignite rows in . the Coalition over fears that house prices are rising too quickly, raising the prospect of a housing bubble while still . leaving the poorer parts of the country worse off. Although . homeowners in every part of the UK saw an annual increase in the value . of their property, levels varied widely from an 11.6 spike in London . where homes are now worth £441,000 on average to a rise of only 0.6 per . cent in the North West. The cost of properties in London . grew at more than double the UK average and are now 18.1 per cent higher than their 2008 peak but homes in Northern Ireland have . nearly halved in value since 2007. Despite a rise in average house . prices in the North East, the official figures show that homes there are . still the cheapest in the country at only £148,000. The average price of homes outside of . England was much lower, with properties in Wales costing £167,000 and . £184,000 in Scotland. Booming market: house prices are continuing to rise according to figures published today by the Office for National Statistics . Excluding London and the South East, UK house prices increased by 3.1 per cent in the 12 months to November 2013. They went up by 0.5 per cent month-on-month in November though there was a steeper rise of 1.4 per cent October. It . marks the third time in just four months that average house prices have . hit a new peak, after records were reached in both August and October . last year. Neal Hudson, an associate director at estate agent Savills, said they had noticed a significant increase in activity in recent months with renewed confidence in the economy and more generous mortgage lending. 'Buyers in London are stretching themselves to make the most of the low interest rates and are being allowed to borrow more than we've seen in a while,' he said. 'We've seen growth is spreading out from London, but there are real extremes with places like Blackpool still well below prices from a couple of years ago.' Capital gains: The property boom in London is continuing with the city seeing growth twice as rapid as the UK average . Property boom: Average house prices have continued to rise since the financial crash of 2008 . The continued surge in the property market has led to calls for the Government to increase the availability of houses with concerns growing for first-time buyers and the chance of a housing bubble. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said the . ONS figures 'will likely maintain concern that a housing bubble could . really develop in 2014'. He said: 'Consequently, the decision of the . Bank of England and the Treasury to end Funding for Lending support for . lending to households from January looks a highly sensible decision, . although in itself it is unlikely to act as a major brake on housing . market activity.' Though news that house prices rises are continuing to grow will be welcome news to homeowners, there is likely to be speculation that interest rates could rise with the rate of inflation falling. George Osborne has played down fears that house prices are rising too fast . Figures published today by the Office for National Statistics show that it has fallen to 2 per cent, meeting the target set by the Bank of England. The Prime Minister welcomed the news on Twitter, saying the growth in the economy and rising employment would 'mean more security for hard-working people'. George Osborne claimed the figures show the Government's economic strategy is working. 'Part of our economic plan is to control immigration and to cap welfare and you see in the inflation numbers today that the economic plan is working for people,' he said. A fall in food prices, particularly lower meat and food costs, was the main factor behind the 2 per cent target being met. Coffee, tea and cocoa were cheaper last month than they were the year before, though inflation for bread and cereals accelerated. Games, toys and hobbies also saw price falls as Christmas approached, with reductions in computer games made for older platforms. Responding to today's figures, Catherine McKinnell MP, Labour’s Shadow Economic Secretary to the Treasury, argued prices are still rising faster than wages.""After three damaging years of flatlining, working people are on average £1600 a year worse off under the Tories.'","The average price of a house in the UK is now £248,000 .

The family of a mother who police say was brutally murdered in a motel room in front of her three children by her estranged husband are fighting for changes to 911 laws that may have saved her life. Kari Rene Hunt Dunn had agreed to meet Brad Allen Dunn, whom she planned to divorce, at the Baymont Inn and Suites in Marshall, Texas, with her kids, aged 9, 4 and 3, on December 1, 2013, for a short visitation. But he apparently ambushed her in the motel room and stabbed her to death in the bathroom, police say. While the alleged attack was happening, Hunt Dunn's nine-year-old daughter tried to call 911 on the motel room phone, following instructions her mother gave her in case of emergencies. However, she wasn't able to call for help because she didn't know she had to press '9' to dial out before calling 911. Tragic: Kari Rene Hunt Dunn, 31, pictured, was allegedly murdered by Brad Allen Dunn, whom she planned to divorce, at the Baymont Inn and Suites in Marshall, Texas, on December 1, 2013, in front of her three kids . Family: Hunt Dunn, right, had agreed to meet Dunn, left, at the Baymont Inn and Suites in Marshall, Texas, with her kids, aged 9, 4 and 3, on December 1, 2013, for a short visitation . 'We are attempting to ensure that any person needing police, EMS or the Fire Department at any hotel or motel location may be able to dial the numbers 911 and receive emergency response,' Hunt Dunn's father Hank Hunt wrote on a Change.org petition demanding lawmakers make hotel phones allow 911 calls more easily. 'In a panic, any under age child, or for that matter anyone in an emergency situation should be able to depend on dialing 911 from any phone in the United States and receiving assistance.' Kari's Law would force all hotel and motel chains, including all 'Mom & Pop' locations to update their phone systems to accept 911 as an emergency call, and use 8 instead as a 'dial out' number. Divorce: In late November, Dunn, pictured left and right, wrote on his Facebook page that his wife wanted to leave him after a decade together and that he was heartbroken and wanted to fight for his marriage . Signs: 'I asked to go to counseling and (she) said no,' he wrote. 'I am so stressed. They just left with her stuff and kids. This is so hard. Maybe venting on here will help me not freak out in my house' 'We pray the lawmakers in our Congress and Senate hear the cries of Kari and her children,' he wrote. As of Tuesday, the petition had received more than 4,489 signatures. Dunn is being held on $5 million bond. Jay Webb, administrative deputy with the Harrison County sheriff's office, confirmed the 31-year-old victim was stabbed. 'I don't know what the situation was. I'm speculating it was from a pending divorce (matter),' he told Marshall News Messenger earlier this month.

Several taxis carrying passengers have been attacked by angry mobs in France, as a dispute over minicab regulations in the country turns physical. There were reports of attacks in both Paris and Lyon, as groups of up to 20 men set upon taxis run by the company Uber, smashing their windows and letting down tires. The violence comes after thousands of taxi drivers staged furious protests across France yesterday, objecting to the emergence of pre-book services that they worry will impact on the hail-and-ride culture they rely on. Anger: The violence comes after thousands of taxi drivers staged furious protests across France, objecting to the emergence of pre-book services such as Uber and Allocab . Under attack: Kat Borlongan, co-founder of consulting firm Five by Five, tweeted that she was travelling from Charles de Gaulle airport in one of the Uber taxis that was set upon by the angry mob . Lucky escape: Ms Borlongan said the protesters threw paint and rocks at the vehicle before attempting to break in. The passengers were left with cuts to their hands from the shattered glass . Kat Borlongan, co-founder of consulting firm Five by Five, says she was travelling from Charles de Gaulle airport in one of the Uber taxis that came under attack. An image she shared on Twitter shows a smashed passenger window and a flat tire that appears to have been slashed with a knife. Ms Borlongan says the angry mob threw paint and rocks at the vehicle before attempting to break in. The passengers were left with cuts to their hands from the shattered glass. In a post on Twitter Ms Borlongan added: ‘Attackers tried to get in the car but our brave @uber driver maneuvered us to safety, changed the tire on the freeway and got us home.’ Renaud Visage, photographer and CTO of Eventbrite, was traveling in the car with Ms Borlongan, and confirmed the attack in an interview with theVerge.com. Renaud Visage said police were standing close by and watched the attack on his vehicle take place but added 'they were just watching... they were not actively doing anything' The violence came after thousands of taxi drivers staged furious protests across France, objecting to the emergence of pre-book services they worry will impact on hail-and-ride culture . Mr Visage said a blockade on the motorway forced cars to drive on a single lane and when the Uber taxi was spotted it was attacked by ‘three or four men’. He added that another group set on the car at a second blockade further down the road, slashing the tire and forcing them to make a dramatic getaway before pulling over and making the emergency repairs. Most worryingly, Mr Visage said police were standing close by and watched the whole incident take place ‘but they were just watching… they were not actively doing anything’. Uber confirmed the incident in a statement on its website. 'That taxis chose to use violence today is unacceptable, that they chose to strike is their business,' the company said. 'However, Parisians also have a choice when it comes to moving around in their city, and today's incident certainly discourages Parisians from choosing a taxi for their next ride.' Renaud Visage, photographer and CTO of Eventbrite, said a blockade on the motorway forced cars to drive on a single lane. He said that when his Uber taxi was spotted it came under attack from 'three or four men' Protest: Empty taxis blocked ranks at airports and stations across France, and up to a thousand drivers attended a demonstration in central Paris . The attacks took place amid a national protest expressing anger over ‘unfair competition’. Empty taxis blocked ranks at airports and stations across the country, and up to a thousand drivers attended a demonstration in central Paris last night. Similar rallies were held in Marseille, Bordeaux, Montpellier and Lyon. The anger comes as a result of concerns that regulations on pre-booking services such as Uber, Snapcar and Allocab are not tight enough and risk damaging the business of traditional hail-and-ride drivers who pay a heavy fee to attain a licence to carry passengers. The French government has already come out on the side of traditional taxi drivers, imposing a minimum 15-minute wait between booking and pick-up on all pre-book services since the beginning of the year. However hail-and-ride drivers are demanding a waiting time of 30 minutes is imposed, along with a minimum €60 fare and tougher licence regulations.","At least two Uber taxis were attacked, one in Paris and another in Lyon .

The former leader of the English Defence League is to tour schools to lecture children on tolerance, it emerged today. Tommy Robinson, who quit the party last year because of its 'extremist elements', wants to help prepare young students for adult life. The 30-year-old, who has convictions for assault, drug and public order offences, has pledged to help tackle racism in Britain since he left the far right party. He is set to start his tour shortly, but the decision to allow into schools has sparked outrage from parents. Change: Tommy Robinson with EDL members during a protest after the murder of Lee Rigby. Robinson has quit and now is set to tour schools to speak about tolerance . 'Given this . man's appalling record for thuggery and his history of inciting racial . tension, it beggars belief that he is being ushered into classrooms,' one told the Mirror. 'What on Earth has he got to say that's worth our children hearing? He should just crawl under a rock and keep quiet.' Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, left the EDL last October, and has received numerous death threats. He said that he was sorry for creating an 'us and them' culture and for causing fear among British Muslims. He claimed 'every single Muslim' was to blame for 'getting away' with the July 7 bombings. Robinson has been mentored by deradicalisation thinktank, the Quilliam Foundation, since he quit his post. 'Having facilitated his departure from the EDL, he . continues to attend our classes to learn more about Islamist extremism,' a spokesman said today. Moved on: The former EDL leader, pictured with political and social commentator Mohammed Ansar, has pledged to fight racism . One of the first visits was to be the Duchess Community High . School in Alnwick, Northumberland, but they have now cancelled. Head of religious education Louis Spence told the Mirror: 'By inviting visitors as diverse as Tommy Robinson, students are. There is a moral courage in thinking through difficult issues, . standing up for what you believe in, whilst still showing respect and . humanity.' Mr Robinson, who was also a BNP member, founded the EDL in 2009 because he was angry that Muslims demonstrated as British troops returned from Afghanistan.

A convicted football hooligan, he was also arrested in May 2012, after allegedly obstructing police as he tried to get close to the spot in Woolwich where Lee Rigby was murdered. Since he left the EDL he has said that his past inflammatory statements had often been fuelled by alcohol and the adrenaline . rush of 'leading the biggest street protest movement in Europe.' Giving reason for his decision to leave the group, Mr Robinson . said he had been sobered by his 18-week stint in prison and by the . experience of being shunned by parents when picking up his children at . school. Discussing the school's cancellation, he told . the BBC Asian Network: 'The school thought it was beneficial and after . pressure and probably intimidation they have cancelled, which is no more . than I would have expected. 'I was asked to speak at Oxford University, but they had to cancel due to threats. 'Am I the right person to do it? Have I got a past? Yes. Am I proud of some of those things? No I'm not.

Reverting back: Bruce Burns, a Republican state senator in Wyoming, said that if the chemicals used in lethal injections are not available, the state should use firing squads . A Wyoming lawmaker is pushing to allow use of the firing squad to execute condemned state inmates if there are ever any issues that prevent the state from securing lethal injections. Republican state senator Bruce Burns said Monday that state law currently calls for using a gas chamber if lethal injection is unavailable. 'The state of Wyoming doesn't have a gas chamber currently, an operating gas chamber, so the procedure and expense to build one would be impractical to me,' said Burns, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. 'I consider frankly the gas chamber to be cruel and unusual, so I went with firing squad because they also have it in Utah.' He's introduced the bill for consideration in the legislative session that starts February 10 in Cheyenne. 'One of the reasons I chose firing squad as opposed to any other form of execution is because frankly it's one of the cheapest for the state,' Burns said. 'The expense of building a gas chamber I think would be prohibitive when you consider how many people would be executed by it, and even the cost of gallows.' Burns said his bill addressed the possibility that the state could have to find a substitute for using lethal injection because a number of states are running short of the chemicals used for lethal injection. Modern day firing squad: This is the execution chamber at Utah State Prison where a firing squad lines up and kills the seated prisoner . What remains: Four of the bullet holes from the killing of Ronnie Lee Gardner on June 18, 2010 are seen in the wood . In Missouri, for example, the state auditor is undertaking a probe of the Missouri Department of Corrections over its use of a new death penalty drug. That state for years had used a three-drug blend to perform executions until pharmaceutical companies stopped selling those drugs to prisons. Missouri has executed two inmates in recent months using the sedative pentobarbital and plans a third execution later this month. The drug comes from a compounding pharmacy in Oklahoma not licensed to do business in Missouri. In line: Wyoming's only inmate currently on death row is Dale Wayne Eaton, 68, who is challenging the constitutionality of the death sentence he received in 2004 for the rape and murder of 18-year-old Lisa Marie Kimmell of Billings, Montana . The pace of inmate executions is much slower in Wyoming, which has only one inmate on death row and last executed an inmate in 1992. Inmate Dale Wayne Eaton, 68, is challenging the constitutionality of the death sentence he received in 2004 for the rape and murder of 18-year-old Lisa Marie Kimmell of Billings, Montana. The Wyoming Supreme Court already has upheld Eaton's conviction, but a federal court has put the execution on hold for the past several years while it considers his appeal. Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington, D.C., said Monday he believes Wyoming could face constitutional challenges if it tried to use the firing squad as its only method of execution. Dieter said Utah has offered inmates the choice of being executed by firing squad but said the state is phasing out the punishment. He said mandating the use of the firing squad if lethal injection were unavailable, as Burns seeks to do, would be a different matter. 'That I think would raise concerns in the federal courts, perhaps the state courts, about whether and unusual, perhaps a cruel and unusual punishment is being inflicted,' Dieter said. 'I don't know how the ultimate ruling would come down, but I think there would be delays as that case got considered and it might even go up to the Supreme Court. This would be unusual. This is not what Utah has done.' Running into problems: A number of states have had problems securing the chemicals used in lethal injections so Burns said that he thought firing squads- like those used in Utah- were the next most humane option .","Republican state senator Bruce Burns believes that gas chambers are less humane than firing squads and would cost too much to build .

Guilty: Sir George Castledine started a relationship with an 83-year-old widow out of sexual desire and financial greed, a panel has ruled . A distinguished professor who was knighted for services to nursing could be thrown out of the profession over his relationship with an 83-year-old widow he was counselling. Sir George Castledine declared his love for the recently bereaved woman and told her he needed to work out at the gym so he could 'make love' to her. He denied that his behaviour was motivated by financial gain or sexual desire - but a committee sitting at the Old Bailey in London has now ruled that this was in fact false. The 67-year-old will be banned from nursing if the Nursing and Midwifery Council decides that his misconduct has impaired his fitness to practice. Sir George regularly visited the elderly patient and showered her with gifts and flowers, accepting thousands of pounds in return. The woman's family became so concerned about his behaviour that they bugged her phone - and heard him calling her 'Tinkerbell' and saying he had to go to the gym or he 'wouldn't be able to make love' to her. NMC panel chairman Susan Hurds said today that he had 'manipulated a vulnerable patient' while motivated by sexual gratification and greed. She added that the woman, known as 'Patient A', was 'clearly grief-stricken' following the death of her husband, and needed bereavement counselling which Sir George was not qualified to give. 'You gave evidence which the panel often found difficult to believe,' Mrs Hurds told Sir George. 'You lacked consistency in your response, added evidence and altered your story as it suited you. 'We concluded that you lied at the outset of the investigation and as the hearing continued. As evidence was put before you you modified your account. 'The panel finds it incredible that the endearments and erotic language you used at no other time than on the occasions on the tape. 'You were deliberately evasive and not consistent but intentionally changed your story.' She added: 'The persistent nature of the telephone calls, late at night and early in the morning and the giving of gifts and eating together in an intimate setting were sexually motivated.' Treatment: Sir George first started working with the widow at Onneley House in Birmingham in November 2008 . Sir George - who was knighted in 2007 . - first treated the woman in November 2008 at Onneley House in . Birmingham, part of the Institute of Ageing and Health. After . the patient told her two daughters that she had begun an affair with . the married father of three, they bugged her phone and were horrified to . hear his repeated professions of love. Mrs Hurds said that the sisters acted solely out of concern for their mother, and were not motivated by financial gain. Sir George, currently a visiting professor at Glyndwr University in Wrexham, insisted that his chats with Patient A were nothing more than 'banter'. He told the hearing: 'Some of the phone calls later were sexual in some respects but it wasn't an offer of having sex with somebody or anything like that. 'One of the times I spoke to her she was having some trouble so I called her and on the telephone we would have banter. It was a befriending role that I had and I was befriending her.' Distinguished: Sir George was knighted by the Queen in a 2007 ceremony at Buckingham Palace . The nurse had previously admitted the contents of his conversations with the woman, and confessed that he had continued to see her even after he was told not to by an official. A number of other allegations, including the claim that he asked Patient A to lie about giving money to him, were initially denied but were ruled to be true by the NMC panel. Later this week the committee will rule on whether or not he can continue practising healthcare. Sir George formerly sat on the Welsh board of a predecessor to the NMC, and helped draw up the code of conduct for nursing which he has now breached. He is a former assistant dean of the nursing faculty at Birmingham City University, and an ex-consultant at Dudley Group of Hospitals.","Sir George Castledine, 67, counselled the woman after her husband died .

The footage shows at least 15 helmeted hooligans on motor cycles and ATVs cutting off vehicles, burning rubber and performing wheelies in front of the R.G. Ortiz Funeral Home. Scroll down for video . Again: Out-of-control motorbike riders, pictured, returned to a busy stretch of Manhattan's Washington Heights Sunday, blocking drivers and terrifying onlookers . Wheelies: The reckless rampage happened just months after a motorist was attacked in front of his wife and child in the same stretch of road . 'It was crazy, one of the craziest I've seen because it was so flagrant,' Jon-Marc McDonald, who filmed the afternoon incident, told the New York Post. 'They were popping wheelies, burning rubber, flying up and down the street.' According to McDonald, 37, the maniac bikers belonged to the same gang that caused chaos in September, leading to the vicious attack on an innocent father. He said they pulled the dangerous stunts every weekend until that happened. 'These guys come out on a pretty regular basis about once a week until the beating incident in September. They quit, but then they started coming back again,' McDonald told the Post. But according to the funeral home, the riders were friends of a man who had passed away and whose service was underway. Spokeswoman Anna Reinoso suggested they may have been putting on the show by way of commemoration, but couldn't confirm, and wasn't sure whether the dead man himself had been a biker. Dangerous: The video, taken Sunday by a nervous neighbor and posted on YouTube, shows the group of daredevils blocking a section of Broadway around West 190th Street . Bikers: 'They were popping wheelies, burning rubber, flying up and down the street,' a witness said . 'They were friends of the deceased, and they just rode around a little bit, maybe five minutes and then they left. There was no problem,' Reinoso told the newspaper. However, McDonald was doubtful, telling the Post, 'Unless they're having a funeral every week for their friends, I doubt that's it. These guys weren't moving for anyone.' The annoyed neighbor said the group eventually took off and allowed traffic to resume only when an NYPD cruiser approached. Police told the Post they had no incident report on the crazed activity. On the video, furious motorists can be heard honking their horns as the gang's reckless road blocking continues. A crowd gathers, including young children, to watch the loud commotion. Last month, nearly a dozen bikers charged with viciously attacking Lien in front of his terrified wife and toddler in September had their charges reduced because the victim's wounds healed so well. Hurt: . Alexian Lien needed stitches after he was attacked by bikers in New . York as he tried to protect his wife and child. An undercover cop was part of the group that attacked Lien and his family . Ten of the bikers, including off-duty . undercover NYPD Detective Woj­ciech Brasz­czok, were to have their . first-degree gang assault and first-degree assault raps lessened to . attempted gang assault and attempted assault, prosecutors announced in . Manhattan Supreme Court December 20. 'The victim's . facial wounds look to be healing in a way which does not constitute . facial disfigurement under the law,' said Manhattan Assistant District . Attorney Joshua Stein­glass. The badly bruised and swollen SUV driver suffered cuts to his head and needed stitches, The Post reported at the time. The suspects could have faced up to . 25 years on the top charge of gang assault, but will will now face 15 . years if convicted on the lesser charge. The charges will formally be reduced after Lien’s next medical checkup, Steinglass told the court. The change does not affect the remaining 11th biker charged, Christopher Cruz, who was only hit with a rap for unlawful imprisonment . in the second degree. Alongside: A biker matching Braszczok's description can be seen riding next to the rear of the SUV in YouTube videos of the attack . Involvement: Braszczok appears to get off his bike in a YouTube video of the brutal assault . The biker gang was furious that Lien had run over one of their compatriots and sped after him seeking revenge. Video . from one of the bikers shows that the gang had boxed in Lien - who was . out for a drive with his wife and their daughter to celebrate their . wedding anniversary. The angry bikers, including undercover detective, caught up Lien on a busy stretch of Washington Heights and bashed out his window with their helmets. When . they were done beating him, some of the thugs tried to attack Rosalyn . Lien and her two-year-old daughter, who were cowering in the car, . Steinglass said. Cruz, who was rear-ended by Lien, was initially charged in misdemeanor court but now faces felony level criminal mischief and up to four years in prison. Allen Edwards, who told cops he was trying to stop the . attack, was also included in the indictment. He 'was the voice of reason and was the most reasonable, courageous . person there, to stand up to these people who he's not friends with. He . doesn't know these bikers', his lawyer said. Hiding: Braszczok leaves court in New York today with his face hidden after a short hearing into his role in the biker gang assault . Lien was chased up the West Side Highway and was pulled out of his car . on W. 178th St. as his wife watched in horror with their young child in . the back seat. A YouTube video of the . attack shows a rider fitting Braszczok's description in the main group . chasing Lien's Range Rover. At no point does he try to stop the pursuit. At around two minutes he surges from the back and positions himself to the left of the vehicle. His red bike - which looks like the one in Braszczok's online postings - is later seen right behind the SUV boxing it in. When . Lien stops for the first time the man has moved to its driver's side . and as one biker tries to open the driver's door, he goes to get off his . bike to assist, but Lien speeds off. Then he is seen again at the end when Lien is set upon during the second, final confrontation. The video shows the man believed to be Braszczok apparently pulling up alongside the right of the Range Rover. His . lawyers in court on October 9 claimed that he never went within 12ft of the vehicle . but he is much closer than that as his bike comes to a halt by the rear . window. Terror: The criminal complaint states that he punched the rear window of the Range Rover, causing it to break. He then allegedly kicked the passenger side whilst Lien's wife was sitting in the front passenger seat and his two-year-old daughter was in the back . Braszczok's defence . also claimed in court that the window was already broken - but in the . video it is still intact when he reaches it. The . court was told that he took part in a 'brutal and brazen' attack and . that while other members of the bike gang hauled Lien out of his car and . set upon him, Braszczok continued to 'terrorize' his family.

Weeds, stems and shoots creep up the Victorian exterior, and have even made their way inside on the highest levels of the crumbling, derelict property. St Edmund's Hospital is the name by which the building was most recently known, but it was actually constructed as a workhouse for the poor in 1936. Growth: Plantlife is creeping through the windows of this first-floor corridor . Desolate: The former hospital site is now full of debris, and plant-life from outside is beginning to creep into the building . High climber: These plants have established themselves even on the upper floors of St Edmund's Hospital . Danger: Fences surround the building, discouraging others from entering . It has stood abandoned for 15 years since the hospital closed after 70 years of service. And, thanks to its place in history as one of the buildings spawned by the 19th-century Poor laws, it has proved difficult to get rid of. Though a tide of outrage at the suffering of those who laboured inside - fanned by tales like those in Charles Dickens's novel Oliver Twist - closed the workhouses for good, they have a lasting place in history. The significance of the building - designed by architect Sir George Gilbert Scott, who was behind London's St Pancras Station and the University of Glasgow - was reaffirmed last year when the Government slapped down an application to remove its listed status. Outside: Vegetation is encroaching on the derelict building, in Northampton . Decay: A combination of vegetation (left) and the work of graffiti artists (right) have helped speed the decline of the building, constructed in the 1830s . Crumbling: Parts of the building's walls have collapsed, leaving some rooms completely exposed to the elements . But inside the former medical centre . is a haunting and dangerous sight. Frequented by the homeless for . shelter, its windows are mostly smashed and sharp debris covers the . floors. Little medical . equipment remains, except for dust-covered signs and the occasional . abandoned bedpan. Elsewhere the crumbling walls, potentially unstable . floors and exposed lift shafts make it an uncomfortable site to visit. St Edmund's was converted into a hospital in the 1930s, and continued for almost 70 years until it was closed down and its functions moved elsewhere. The land was bought up by developers and other buildings, which are part of the original hospital site, have been demolished and replaced by a Tesco Express store and a restaurant. Former developers Rochmills had planned to turn the site into retirement homes and office space, but their plans, submitted in 2010, were withdrawn shortly after. Ward: Signs remain identifying the different areas of the hospital, as well as the occasional medical item such as the pictured bedpan . Untouched: The dusty sign to the right identifies the Wordsworth Ward area of the former hospital . Dangerous: This staircase, left, leads to potentially unstable upper floors, while lift shafts such as this (right) are now exposed through the hospital . Disused: Wallpaper peels from the wall around this abandoned piece of equipment . Worse for wear: The hospital complex has been abandoned since 1998 . Planning permissions for the site has now lapsed, which means that the local authority would have to approve any further work before it can take place. Last year there were attempts by an anonymous applicant to remove the building's listed status - claiming that it never should have been granted in the first place - which would have made it easier to develop the site. But the Government, supported by advisory body English Heritage, rejected the bid because of the building's importance as a former workhouse. At the time an English Heritage spokesman told the local paper: 'We’re pleased the Government has agreed with our recommendation to keep St Edmund’s Hospital in Northampton on the statutory List. 'Built in 1836-7, it was one of the first generation of New Poor Law workhouses, designed by the eminent Victorian architect George Gilbert Scott, and it represents a key moment in changing social attitudes towards the provision made for the poor and destitute.' Bare: The hospital site has long been stripped of any medical supplies . Message: The walls still feature instructions to patients and visitors . Bedding down: The eerie development, formerly a workhouse for the poor, is now used occasionally by homeless people for shelter .","St Edmund's Hospital in Northampton was built as a workhouse in 1836 by the architect who designed St Pancras .

A couple have been arrested in India for allegedly torturing their 11-year-old maid by inserting green chillies into her genitals. Sarjil Ansari, a 38-year-old napkin seller, was arrested at the weekend along with his wife Farhat, after claims that they beat and starved the girl who was forced to look after their children and clean their house. According to the girl's complaint she was often forced to eat the chillies if she urinated through fear while being tortured. A couple have been arrested in Thane, near Mumbai, India, for allegedly torturing their 11-year-old maid by inserting chillies into her genitals . While the abuse was taking place the couple used to turn up their stereo in order to drown out the girl's screams. A local police officer said: 'They used to regularly torture and beat up the girl. The girl complained that she was forced to eat chillies, which were also applied on her body. 'Often the family would turn up the volume on their home music system to muffle her cries for help.' Mr Ansari allegedly bought the girl for £150 from her parents in Utta Pradesh province last year, promising them that she would be sent to school in Mumbai and be given a good education. Instead she was forced into domestic servitude where she was required clean utensils, wash clothes, dust and even run errands for the couple's business. The couple, who were arrested in Thane, near Mumbai (pictured), allegedly beat the girl and starved her . According to the Times of India, if the girl misbehaved she was beaten and starved for days on end. When she was found by police she had serious injury marks all over her body, including her stomach, back and neck. The case is the latest of alleged abuse of domestic servants in in India, where thousands of workers, often children trafficked from remote and poverty-stricken states, toil for long hours in homes with almost no legal protection. In October last year, a teenage girl working as a maid in New Delhi was hospitalised after being rescued from a home where campaigners said she was slashed with knives and mauled by dogs. In 2006 India passed legislation banning employment of children under 14 in households, roadside eateries and hotels, but the law is widely flouted in the country of 1.2 billion people.","Sarjil Ansari, 38, and his wife Farhat have been arrested in Thane, India .

The attorney for a Dallas Cowboy player on trial for a fatal drink-driving accident has argued that the player's size means he is less affected by alcohol. Josh Brent was more than twice the legal limit for alcohol when he crashed his Mercedes in December 2012, killing his friend and teammate Jerry Brown. The 25-year-old failed a roadside sobriety test but his attorney George Milner has argued that at 6ft 2in and 320lb Brent could safely drink more than other people. Defense: Josh Brent, left, and his attorney George Milner, who argues the player wasn't drunk despite being over the legal drink-drive limit . Brent, a former defensive tackle, could face 20 years in prison if found guilty of intoxication manslaughter. He had been friends with his passenger and victim, Mr Brown, since they were students at University of Illinois. On the opening day of the trial yesterday, the court heard Brent's blood-alcohol level was 0.189 per cent. The legal limit in Texas is 0.08. Police video shows Brent failing a roadside sobriety test, where he was unable to recite the alphabet, and he allegedly told officers he 'had a buzz going on', ABC News reported. Bar receipts showed that on December 8, the night of the crash, Brent had bought several cocktails and three bottles of champagne, prosecutors said. 'This is not a difficult case, ladies . and gentlemen. There will be no . disputing the fact that he was drinking that night,' prosecutor Heath Harris said. But Brent's attorney has argued that because of his size, Brent can safely drink more than others. 'Josh Brent is as big as a house. He was guilty of being stupid and driving too fast, but he was not drunk,' Mr Milner said. A University of Florida toxicologist, who is not part of the trial, has cast doubt on the defense. Bruce Goldberger told ABC News: 'One's . impairment has absolutely nothing to do with their size and weight and . height.'

Fatal: Josh Brent's Mercedes flipped over and landed on its roof in the December 2012 crash . When police arrived at the crash scene, in which Brent's Mercedes has flipped over, he told officers he'd had 'a reasonable amount' to drink, Dallas News reported. When he was asked to walk in a straight line he wobbled, and he missed out a few letters when asked to say the alphabet, the court was told. But Mr Milner has argued that Brent's ability to perform the roadside sobriety test was impaired because he had just been in a high-speed crash. Brent, who has left the Cowboys, is also facing charges of driving with an expired and suspended license. He has pleaded not guilty.","Josh Brent faces charges of intoxication manslaughter over 2012 crash .

Mother and son: Natasha Johnson-Richards with victim Akil, who was attacked outside school in a filmed beating, then sent to him by email . The fight happened as Akil walked out of school last Thursday. The bigger pupil squared up to the teenager before he knocked the teenager to the ground with a punch to the head. Parents collecting their children from school can be seen just yards away but no one steps into the stop the violence. After the attack, Akil spent five hours in hospital where he needed X-rays to his ribs and treatment for a chipped tooth.

Christine Wyvell was handed an 18 month prison sentence suspended for two years after she provided her neighbour with a prescription drug, 100 times stronger than morphine, which may have contributed to his death . A pensioner who gave her neighbour a prescription drug 100 times stronger than morphine, which may have contributed to his death, has avoided jail. Christine Wyvell, 69, said she had been trying to ease Gary Vickerson's back pain when she gave him the Fentinol patches, even though she had been warned they were strictly for her own use. Wyvell gave a packet of 100mg patches and two unknown tablets to Mr Vickerson, 39, after they met in a pub on Canvey, Essex. He collapsed and died alone in his caravan just hours later - on what would have been his 40th birthday. Wyvell, of Thorney Bay Caravan Park, Canvey, was handed an 18-month prison sentence suspended for two years when she appeared at Basildon Crown Court yesterday. Charlotte Davidson, prosecuting, told the court Wyvell had been celebrating her birthday at a pub on Canvey when she met Mr Vickerson, who lived on the same caravan park, and his friend Anita Lynch. During the course of the evening Mr Vickerson told her that he was suffering severe back pain - a recurring problem caused by a serious cycling accident when he was 17. The court heard Wyvell told him she had prescription pain killers that could help, which she had been given by her doctor. Later Wyvell took Mr Vickerson and Miss Lynch back to her caravan and handed him two unknown tablets and a packet of Fentinol. She told him that she was giving him painkillers so strong they would be categorised as class A drugs and that he should not take them with alcohol. The court heard this was despite Wyvell knowing he was drunk. The next day, Mr Vickerson did not answer telephone calls from friends, family or work colleagues. Four days later he was found dead on the floor of his caravan by a colleague after he did not turn up for work. Wyvell, pictured in 2011 at Thorney Bay Caravan Park, said she had been trying to ease Gary Vickerson's back pain when she gave him the Fentinol patches . Police initially did not treat Mr Vickerson’s death as suspicious and the court heard officers did not take a full inventory of what was in his caravan. Because the death was not treated as suspicious a post-mortem was not carried out on Mr Vickerson’s body for eight days - which meant doctors struggled to carry out an accurate drug test. Fentinol, however, was discovered in his system. One doctor wrote a report to say that Fentinol contributed to his death while another said it could have. In mitigation, Wyvell told the court that Mr Vickerson’s death played on her conscience every day. She admitted one count of supplying class A drugs. Wyvell, pictured in 2011, gave a packet of 100mg patches and two unknown tablets to Mr Vickerson, 39, after they met in a pub . Sentencing Wyvell, his honour Judge David Owen-Jones, said the case was so unusual that normal sentencing guidelines did not apply. He said: 'It is clear from the evidence that your doctor had prescribed you with Fentinol, a drug 100 times more potent than morphine. The mother of a man who was found dead after taking class A painkillers, has paid tribute to him. Gary Vickerson, was found dead on the floor of his caravan at the Thorney Bay Caravan park on Canvey in November 2012. Yesterday his neighbour, Christine Wyvell, 69, was handed an 18-month suspended sentence for supplying him with class A drug and painkiller, Fentinol. Gary worked as an overhead linesman for Babcock and had lived on Canvey for eight years after moving to Essex from his native Yorkshire. His mother, Anne Vickerson, 71, who still lives near Doncaster, said: 'He was a very good conversationalist and was very popular. 'He was a keen cyclist, but had a serious cycling accident in his teens which had a big impact on his life. 'He had other hobbies and played the trumpet. 'Gary never went to university but was still extremely well read and particularly like JRR Tolkien, the author of the Hobbit. 'He was never married and did not have children - that’s one of the big regrets of his life I think.' 'You had been warned that the patches were only to be used by you and that they could cause harm to another person if given to them. 'Even if they displayed the same symptoms as you.' Following the hearing, Mr Vickerson's sister Adele Bailey said: 'This has been a nightmare. There were mistakes made at the beginning which meant my brother’s death was not treated as suspicious. 'Then the coroner’s office was told he had been prescribed the Fentinol which was not correct. 'This case has had a horrendous impact on my family. Every day we have been thinking about this case and we have not been able to move on and grieve. 'All I have ever wanted is justice for my brother.' Prosecutor Charlotte Davidson told the court a 'breakdown in communication' was responsible for mistakes made by paramedics and the coroner’s office. She said a post mortem on Mr Vickerson’s body was not carried out for eight days, which meant drug tests on his body were less accurate. It was not until May 2013 when Anita Lynch - the woman who had been drinking with Mr Vickerson and Wyvell on the night of his death - came forward to give a statement that police launched an investigation and Wyvell was arrested. In September 2013, Wyvell appeared in court accused with supplying class A drugs, however last minute concerns raised by Mr Vickerson’s family meant that the case was adjourned so that prosecutors could assess whether there was enough evidence to charge her with manslaughter. The case was sent to Chelmsford where it was set to be tried by a High Court Judge, but last week Mr Vickerson’s family were told there was not enough evidence to proceed with a manslaughter charge and yesterday Wyvell pleaded guilty to the charge of supplying class A drugs.","Christine Wyvell said she had been trying to ease neighbour's back pain .

The 45-year-old, a former warrant officer in the Royal Army Physical Training Corps, has ditched his military uniform for that of a butler and now works at the iconic Savoy in London. Then and now: Former soldier Steven Grey, pictured left in Iraq in 2003, has swapped the frontline for serving the rich and famous at one of the world's most opulent hotels . Instead of carrying an Army-issue assault rifle and 60lb backpack, Steven is now found carrying tea-trays laden with fine china and cutting the finest cigars to cater for the every whim of guests staying at the lavish hotel where rooms cost up to £12,000 a night. He is famously discreet about guests who include royalty, world leaders and stars of stage and screen. 'A good butler never talks what he sees,' he says. But the star status of many who stay at the Savoy is undoubted. Famous former guests include Sir Winston Churchill, Frank Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe. At your service: Steven is now found carrying tea-trays laden with fine china to cater for the every whim of guests staying at the lavish hotel where rooms cost up to £12,000 a night . A normal shift will see Steven him acting as a Jeeves-style personal butler for guests staying in 20 suites. His duties include being a personal shopper, secretarial tasks and a travel consultant. A career amid the elegance of the Savoy is a far cry from his time in the Army when the married former soldier served on the frontline. A veteran of more than 20 years, Steven joined the Royal Engineers straight from school and then transferred to the physical training corps. He ran adventurous training packages and was later in charge of the rest and recuperation centre during the Iraq conflict in July 2003 where he came under shell fire. Day job: A normal shift will see Steven him acting as a Jeeves-style personal butler for guests staying in 20 suites . Training: Steven had always dreamed of running his own hotel so enrolled at the International Butler Academy in Holland to learn the trade . He said: 'It was pretty dangerous . because all the enemy had run away when the mission began in March, but . by the summer they'd regrouped and were coming back. 'On a tour of duty troops can't let their physical fitness drop so we'd go around bases setting them up with gym equipment. 'I had to organise three-day packages . for the soldiers so they could chill out and relax, doing whatever they . wanted - shopping, swimming, sunbathing. Then when they were refreshed . it was back to the frontline where they were getting mortared and shot . at.' Serving soldier: Steven Grey, who joined the Army after leaving school, undertook a tour of duty to Iraq in 2003 . By June 2012, Steven . had suffered a hip injury and decided he wanted to do 'something a . little more sedate where I wasn't running around with a pack on my . back.' He had always dreamed . of running his own hotel so to learn the trade he enrolled at the . International Butler Academy in a 14th Century castle in Holland. He . said: 'I thought I'd just breeze through the course but it was like a . military-style boot camp. They managed to break a lot of guys. Past experience: Steven in his Mess Kit in 1994 . 'There was sleep deprivation, long hours, non-stop work and rigorous inspections. It was just like basic training in the Army. 'It . was hard but once I'd left the course with my diploma you realise they . were being harsh to be kind. It was perfect for training you how to deal . with the most awkward guests.'

In August he was offered a job at the hotel, which opened in 1889 and boasts 195 guest rooms and 73 suites. He said: 'It was a little bit . overwhelming because of the magnificent reputation of the hotel. If you . mention the Savoy anywhere in the world, people instantly recognise it. 'I started to doubt myself but the military training I've had over the years taught me how to handle the pressure. 'It . is the best place to work - it has incredibly high standards, an . amazing history and so many stars have stayed here over the years It's . unbelievable.' Steven, who is married to Rachel, 40, a . major in the Army's Education Training Services, said it was hard work . trying to meet the demands of guests while maintaining an unruffled . exterior. He said: 'You are expected to have knowledge of the fineries of the world and are virtually a PA for the guests. 'They may ask where the best restaurants are or they might want tickets for a show or just to sit and chat.'

Despite being a completely different world from the Army, Steven said his career in uniform had given him ideal skills to become a butler. He said: 'Organisation is the key to everything. I’m dealing with 20 rooms, all of which will have different requests, so you have to be fast and learn how to prioritise. 'All these skills applied in the military as they do in civvy street. I'm used to working under pressure and as part of a team as you do in the Army. 'You won't see me lose my cool or my temper. If something needs to be done, I'll put it in order.' Steven . believes it is vital that serving soldiers recognise the skills they . have learned in the military are valuable in 'civvy street', especially . when the Ministry of Defence is axing 30,000 troops to save money. Equally, he thinks employers need to . 'break through the perception that soldiers are just running around a . battlefield shooting people'.

Crime lord: Babar Qasam, 35, pictured, led a crime gang which put £1.5million of illegal drugs on the street . Prosecutors have managed to recover just £160 from the leader of a drugs gang who pumped over £1.5million of cocaine and heroin onto the streets of Britain. Babar Qasam, 35, is serving an 11-year sentence for conspiracy to supply heroin after he was convicted in May. But attempts to claw back his ill-gotten gains have so far produced little. Police say the large-scale operation allowed Qasam and his gangsters to live 'quite affluent' lives. But even though officers seized around £100,000 during their investigations, the hearing could only prove that Qasam personally made £63,163 from his crimes. Officers had used Qasam and his fellow criminals as the faces of a poster campaign to tell residents that 'crime doesn't pay' after they were sentenced to a combined total of 167 years behind bars. But since Qasam's own assets have dwindled so much, a Proceeds of Crime hearing in Preston, Lancashire, was only able to reclaim £160 - all the money he had access to. He and his accomplices were caught by a nationwide investigation which seized £200,000 in bank notes, 45kgs of . cocaine and quantities of heroin and cannabis. The gang operated in Lancashire, Berkshire, Cumbria and West Yorkshire, distributing drugs which were smuggled into the UK. Police . found £51,240 in cash in one of the gang’s Range Rovers. One kilogram of . cocaine, worth £100,000, was recovered from another home while £18,650 . in cash was taken from a van driven by two of the gang which was stopped . on the M6. Cash: A haul of £18,650, pictured, was recovered by police from a van on the M6 involved in Qasam's operation . File under 'C': This haul of cash, seized from a Landrover, totals £51,240 . Bundle: This £29,920 was also gathered up by officers . And £29,920 . in cash was seized from a vehicle being driven on the M60 near . Manchester. Prosecutors said the arrests represented the 'dismantling of a prominent source of drugs' in the North of England. Despite the unimpressive total recovered from Qasam, police today pledged that they would target any further wealth he amasses in future. A spokesman said: 'Where possible . Lancashire Police will track down illegal assets and we deprive . criminals of cash and possessions. 'In . most cases the main motivation of criminals is financial gain and . therefore this is an area in which we can hit the criminal hardest. Drugs: Police seized this 1-kilogram stash of cocaine from the gang, worth around £100,000 . Pulled over: Investigators move in on a Land Rover carrying cash from a drug deal, which police pulled over . Jailed: Lancashire police posted this billboard after Qasam and his gang were sentenced. Police at the time said it proved that crime 'doesn't pay' 'I . would also reassure people that if in the future, after paying the . amount, individuals appear to have further wealth that police believe . has been the result of crime, they can be brought before the courts . again to assess any other available assets that can be offset against . the overall benefits they have accrued from their crimes.'

The new characters will be relatives of Kal Nazir, a former soldier played by Jimi Mistry, who joined the ITV hit two months ago. Although Coronation Street has been on the air for 53 years, it has never before featured a Muslim family, which producer Stuart Blackburn admitted was 'bizarre' given the multi-cultural makeup of Manchester where the soap is set. Pioneering: Coronation Street is getting its first Muslim family with the relatives of Kal Nazir - played by Jimi Mistry, left . 'Kal and his son and daughter live with his mum and dad so we’re going to bring them on to the Street,' Mr Blackburn told the Daily Mirror. 'And that'll be the first Muslim family that Corrie's ever had. Bizarre isn't it?' Nearly one in six residents of Manchester is a Muslim, according to data from the 2011 census, meaning that followers of the faith have been significantly under-represented on Coronation Street. Show bosses say they have consulted experts over 'all aspects of their lifestyle, culture and religion' in a bid to ensure that the family accurately reflects the experience of Muslims in Manchester. However, the soap could cause controversy by showing the Nazirs socialising in the Rovers Return pub even though Islam bans its adherents from drinking alcohol.

In 2010 he competed on Strictly Come Dancing, and later became engaged to his dance partner Flavia Cacace.

John Wisniewski, the liberal state assemblyman leading the charge against New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in the wake of his George Washington Bridge traffic scandal, announced Monday that he has formed a new special investigative committee to issue subpoenas and press for more answers. Just hours later, Wisniewski asked a prosecutor . to bring criminal charges against a major figure in the 'Bridgegate' mess who refused to answer questions in a January 9 hearing where he . appeared under subpoena. WIsniewski asked for a misdemeanor contempt prosecution of David Wildstein, a Port Authority official and childhood acquaintance of the governor who resigned in December. Wildstein cited his constitutional right against . self-incrimination during . the Jan. 9 hearing. Minutes later, the transportation committee voted to . hold him in contempt. In a letter to Mercer County, N.J. Prosecutor Joseph Bocchini, Jr., Wisniewski wrote Monday that his committee . 'unanimously believes that Mr. Wildstein’s obfuscation of our . investigation rises to the level of [criminal] contempt under existing state . statutes.' In a press conference earlier, New Jersey General Assembly Speaker-Elect Vincent Prieto called the newly anointed legislative body a 'super investigatory committee' organized to expand the existing work of the transportation committee, chaired by Wisniewski. 'This has become more than a transportation issue,' Prieto said. 'We've now gone beyond that.' 'Our concern is that there was a blatant abuse of power,' Wisniewski told reporters on Monday. 'It's not sufficient to fire some people.' Christie has dismissed at least two officials implicated in the case. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . John Wisniewski (L) will chair a new 'super investigative committee' to dig into Chris Christie's actions related to the Bridgegate scandal. Assembly Speaker-elect Vincent Prieto (R) appointed him on Monday . Unstoppable force meets immovable object? Chris Christie has boasted that he works well with Democrats in his state legislature, but that cooperation is about to come to a screeching halt . David Wildstein refused to testify before Assemblyman John Wisniewski's transportation committee on Jan. 9, citing his Fifth Amendment rights, but assembly democrats voted to hold him in contempt -- and now Wisniewski has asked a prosecutor to charge him with a crime . The two aides Gov. Christie dismissed . last week, former Deputy Chief of Staff Bridget Kelly and former . Campaign Director Bill Stepien, will receive the new bipartisan . committee's first two subpoenas, he said. Emails . collected by Wisniewski's transportation panel implicated both in a . plot to exact political retribution against the mayor of Fort Lee, N.J. by closing several of his town's entry lanes to the George Washington . Bridge, snarling traffic for four days in September. Christie . has forcefully denied knowing anything about the plan, even as his . confidantes and political appointees tumble around him. The new committee will officially convene on Thursday in a special legislative session. Wisniewski said Monday morning in a statement that evidence he has collected to date 'makes clear that this now goes ... into the highest ranks of the executive branch.' 'This investigation will continue with increased intensity,' he said. That effort, he told reporters, will require 'more severe' allocation of staff and funding. Wisniewski's rhetoric has also grown in intensity since last week. In an interview Thursday with MailOnline, he hedged on the idea of launching a bid to impeach Christie, calling it 'premature' and 'not the way to go right now.' But appearing Sunday on the CBS program 'Face The Nation,' he seemed ready to go down that politically fraught road. 'If it becomes known that the governor was involved and he knew about it and he knew about the cover-up, and he was approving the actions taken by his senior staff, that raises serious questions that the assembly ought to look at,' Wisniewski said. 'And that ought to be considered in light of what our responsibility is. The Assembly has the ability to do articles of impeachment.' Former Deputy Chief of Staff Bridget Kelly (L) and former Campaign Manager Bill Stepien (R, looking at Christie) were shown the door on Wednesday and will likely see subpoenas this week . Former Port Authority official David Wildstein resigned in December; he appeared before John Wisniewski's transportation committee on Thursday but refused to answer questions about the bridge scandal . In addition to having subpoena power, the new committee will have the full-time services of a special counsel, Prieto said, . In New Jersey, a 'special counsel' is the equivalent of a 'special prosecutor' in the federal government, according to a Republican legal expert in the Garden State who spoke with MailOnline. 'You have a a lawyer recruited from outside the government and trusted with the authority to investigate, subpoena witnesses, and even seek indictments,' he said. Prieto, the incoming assembly speaker, told reporters Monday that 'seeking outside counsel is very important in case there's other outside agencies that are going to be involved in this.' A general assembly clerk reached in Trenton would not speculate about how fast the committee would do its job, or how soon Kelly and Stepien might testify. In a transportation committee hearing on Thursday, former New York New Jersey Port Authority official David Wildstein refused to answer Wisniewski's questions, invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. A raft of emails released by the committee a day later showed that Port Authority officials knew within hours of the bridge lanes' closure that public safety was at risk. Yet the traffic pattern entering the George Washington Bridge from Fort Lee remained unchanged for four days. Christie faces new pressure to explain what knowledge, if any, he had of the scheme before it was carried out. He is thought to be a likely 2016 presidential candidate. Wisniewski's renewed investigation is one of three now targeting the brash, outspoken Garden State governor. Top legislative cop: Wisniewski has emerged as Chris Christie's biggest antagonist, and is talking about the possibility of impeaching the Republican governor . Bridget Kelly and David Wildstein kicked off the traffic shenanigans with a gleeful internal email on August 13, subpoenaed documents show . Feeder lanes onto the George Washington Bridge from Fort Lee, N.J. (lower right) were blocked in September for four days, choking off traffic and gridlocking the town, an effort apparently led by Christie employees out of spite for Fort Lee's mayor . U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Paul Fishman, whom President Barack Obama appointed to fill the office that Christie left for the governor's mansion, is probing the 'Bridgegate' controversy. Fishman has already attracted barbs from conservatives for his history of making large donations to Democratic political candidates, including Hillary Clinton and John Kerry. And an inspector general in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is investigating whether Christie's administration broke federal law when it awarded disaster relief funds following Superstorm Sandy to a firm that produced tourism commercials. The 'Stronger Than The Storm' ads, produced by East Rutherford, N.J.-based MWW and a subcontractor, cost $4.7 million to make – and included cameos by the governor, his wife and three of their children. Another firm offered to produce the ad campaign for $2.5 million, but its scripts did not include the Christies. The ads ran in the weeks leading up to the governor's November 2013 re-election.","New Jersey's Democrat-led legislature is sharpening its knives as the governor insists he knew nothing of payback plot to close bridge lanes .

A swearing toddler who became a viral video sensation will remain with his teenage mother, after a judge ruled that both were to be placed in care with the same foster family. Sixteen-year-old Ennisha Devers, from Omaha, Nebraska, felt compelled to defend her parenting after footage emerged of her two-year-old boy violently cursing. Ennisha and her baby had been separated and placed in protective custody over a separate incident, but yesterday a judge ruled they would be rehomed together with foster carers. WARNING: Video contains graphic content . The little boy is seen flipping his middle finger and cursing on the tape which was posted online by the Omaha police union . The video of the child swearing and . knocking over furniture went viral after the Omaha Police Officer's Association posted it on their website to show the 'cycle of violence and thuggery' they say they come up against in their work. The . police union's posting of the video attracted criticism from the city's police chief, the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska and at least one community leader, CNN reported. They said the republishing of the video was antagonising to the city's minority communities. But the organization . defended itself by revealing that the boy was recently injured in a gang . shooting. Ennisha Devers, the child's 16-year-old mother said her son was being encouraged to use bad language by her brother's friend and that she had no knowledge of the tape . The . video shows the boy wearing a diaper and being . harangued with racial slurs and obscenities by at least three adults. At one point, the child flips his middle finger, knocks over a chair and says: 'Shut up, b****.' With encouragement of the adults' laughter, the little boy continues to curse and swear. The mother says . that the video was filmed without her knowledge by her brother's friend. Miss Devers told CNN: . 'He's a smart little boy. All that cussing that he did, he doesn't do . that. Somebody told him to do that. My son doesn't do that. I don't . allow it.' She added: 'He had a clean diaper, the house was clean and like they said, kids curse, every kid does it.' A toddler who was cursed at and encouraged to curse in a video posted online has been placed in protective custody . The Omaha police union said it found . the video on a known local gang member's Facebook page. The video has . been viewed several thousand times and remains on the union's website. According to ketv.com, recent court documents revealed the highly dangerous situation that the child was living in. In October, the toddler was one of five injured when someone fired shots through their front door. The . adults caring for the child repeatedly allowed known gang members into . their home - even after the state paid twice to relocate the family away . from danger. The little boy's father is believed to have been killed in a gang-related shooting at the age of 17. The boy's . grandmother was arrested on weapons charges in December after guns were . brought into the house while children were present. His grandfather is currently in prison for drug and felony charges. Facebook comments: People react to the video post from the self-proclaimed uncle of the toddler . Union President John Wells defended their decision to post the video saying 'a lot of these children end up dealing with law enforcement' The police union defended the video posting saying that without the public scrutiny that followed it, the children would likely still be living in an extremely volatile situation. A statement from Omaha Police Officers' Association website read:'This is 100% about a criminal culture, a cycle of poverty, a cycle of lack of education , a cycle of lack of parenting and – dare we say ''a thug cycle'' – that is literally killing families and crushing the futures of innocent children across Omaha.' 'The . whole point of this is to give an unfiltered view of what police . officers deal with every day,' added Sgt. John Wells, president of the . Omaha Police Officers Association. At one point in the video, . the adults reference a gang in northeast Omaha, which is where more than . half of the city's roughly 40 homicides a year typically happen. Willie Hamilton, executive director of Black Men United in Omaha, said . the police union didn't have to post the video to promote discussion . about helping families overcome poverty. 'It's . almost like the kid was abused twice: once by the people in the video . and once by the police officers association,' said Hamilton, whose group . promotes mentoring and works to strengthen families. Hamilton . said if the police union had been concerned about this child, officers . should have reached out to churches and community groups to help. 'If their overall goal was to educate people about the problems, this was an inept way to do it,' he said. Omaha . Police Chief Todd Schmaderer issued a statement on Tuesday to clarify that . the department wasn't involved in posting the video and doesn't have . control over what the union posts. 'I . strongly disagree with any postings that may cause a divide in our . community or an obstacle to police community relations,' Schmaderer . said.","Five children, including the toddler from video, removed from the home in Omaha, Nebraska after it was used for gang activities .

An Afghan man has been granted asylum in Britain because of his ‘human right’ to religion - despite him being an atheist. He came to Britain six years ago and since then has abandoned his Muslim faith. Now the Home Office have granted him refugee status, because he says he will face persecution if sent home. His lawyers say it is the first time anyone has been given asylum on religious grounds who is an atheist. An Afghan man has been granted asylum in Britain by the Home Office (pictured) because of his right to religion . The case was prepared by Kent Law Clinic, which is staffed partly by students studying law courses at the University of Kent’s Law School. Clinic Solicitor, Sheona York said: 'We are absolutely delighted for our client. We also want to welcome the prompt and positive response of the Home Office. ‘We believe that this is the first time that a person has been granted asylum in this country on the basis of their atheism. ‘The decision represents an important recognition that a lack of religious belief is in itself a thoughtful and seriously-held philosophical position.’ The 21-year-old man came to Britain in 2007 when he was just 16 years old to escape a conflict involving his family, during which his family home was attacked. He was brought up as a Muslim but since arriving in the UK he ‘gradually turned to atheism’, his lawyers say. After arriving in Britain, he attended church to ‘see if Christianity had any meaning for him’. But legal documents submitted as part of his case state: ‘After a while, he realised that it did not and that he had no religious beliefs.’ In February 2006 Afghan national Abdul Rahman was arrested when he converted to Christianity. Following political pressure on Afghan President Hamid Karzai (pictured) he was released . His lawyers argued that if he was returned to the war-torn country, he could face the death sentence. Under Sharia law, he is regarded as an ‘apostate’, because he has renounced Islam. In some Islamic countries, including Afghanistan, this can result in a death sentence. His lawyers argued that he would be forced to remain discreet about his atheist beliefs if he went back - and was bound to be discovered. ‘In Afghanistan, and even in Kabul, life is lived in such a way that everyone is connected with everyone else. There is no sense of privacy, and his lack of religious beliefs would become very quickly known,’ they argued. They argued that because every aspect of daily life and culture in Afghanistan is influenced by Islam, living discreetly would be ‘virtually impossible’. His application was brought under the 1951 Refugee Convention, which protects asylum seekers who could face religious persecution, political oppression, torture or other ill treatment. The lawyers argued the man - who has not been named - would face persecution on the grounds of religion. It also applies, they argued, to anyone who needed protection because of their lack of religious belief. Claire Splawn, a second year law student at the university, worked on the case. She said: ‘We argued that an atheist should be entitled to protection from persecution on the grounds of their belief in the same way as a religious person is protected.’ In February 2006, an Afghan national, Abdul Rahman was arrested and threatened with the death penalty because he converted to Christianity. He was imprisoned but - following political pressure on Afghan President Hamid Karzai from the US and elsewhere - he was released. The prosecution case against him was dropped on technical grounds, after a psychological examination concluded he was mentally unfit to stand trial. He was eventually granted asylum in Italy.","Home Office granted man refugee status because of his right to religion .

But his confidence appeared to have got the better of him when, after leaning too far forward, he accidentally tipped the toy over and ended up in a heap on the floor. Hilarious: After taking his time nervously climbing on to the rocking horse, the adorable panda cub quickly grew overconfident. Minutes later he tumbled off the toy while leaning too far forward . Clumsy: The panda cub shifted too much weight to the front of the rocking horse and overbalanced. He thought little of his fall however, and was back on the horse in no time .

A farmer is turning one of his fields into a stone age-style burial chamber where families can pay £1,000 to bury their relatives' ashes. Wiltshire landowner Tim Daw, 52, is laying down huge sarsen stones, similar to those at nearby Stonehenge, to form the base of a burial mound which will eventually hold the remains of 2,400 people. The diggers moved in to his field at All Cannings, near Marlborough, after he won planning permission to build a 50m-long mound, the first such chamber to be built in Britain for 5,000 years. Wiltshire farmer Tim Daw, 52, is turning one of his fields into a 'neolithic-style' burial mound . Mr Daw says that that 50-metre long mound at All Cannings should be completed within six months . How it will look: The design of the All Cannings burial mound is based on West Kennet Long Barrow nearby . Mr Daw says it will take him six months to complete the mound, which will contain seven large chambers, each with several shelves containing lockable alcoves, or niches, that can be secured for a family. He plans to charge around £1,000 for a family niche with space for the ashes of up to eight people. The farmer, an atheist who works as a steward at Stonehenge, said: 'We've already had five people sign up, and that's without really pushing it at all. 'It's being made of sarsen stones weighing up to one tonne each and is quite a simple construction.  We will have to keep the inside secure as other people's remains will be in there too, but the idea is that it will be a place for families to come. 'They'll be able to sit and contemplate on the mound'. Mr Daw said the burial chamber will be non-religious, but it is already attracting interest from pagans because of its alignment, designed to allow the sunrise of the winter solstice to shine through the entrance and down its passageway. Mr Daw, seen here sitting on what will be the entrance, says he has had a good deal of interest already . The burial mound lies in the Marlborough Downs, near Stonehenge and Avebury stone circles, and its design is based on the nearby long barrow at West Kennet, near Silbury Hill, the largest man-made mound in Europe. The 220-acre farm lies in the middle of Wiltshire's 'crop circle country', where mysterious patterns appear in fields of crops overnight. Theories as to how they occur range from UFO landings to over-zealous cider-drinking, but they draw large crowds each summer. Wiltshire is strewn with Neolithic burial mounds, or barrows, dating back to the new stone age period, beginning about 10,200BC and ending between 4,500-2,000BC. They were constructed using vast sarsen stones or wooden posts and then covered with mud, soil and grass. West Kennet Long Barrow, six miles from Mr Daw's barrow at All Cannings, is one of the largest, measuring 100m long.  Excavations suggest work began on the tomb, which has five sarsen stone chambers, in 3,600BC, some 400 years before Stonehenge was begun. Silbury Hill, pictured, dates back to the Neolithic period but mystery still surrounds its original purpose . East Kennet Long Barrow is the largest in Britain, a wedge-shaped burial chamber measuring 106m long.  It is believed to have been open for several centuries before being sealed up. Lanhill Long Barrow, near Chippenham, is a late Neolithic long barrow which was found to contain the remains of several people from the same family, ranging in age from 12 months to 60 years. Beckhampton Long Barrow, near Avebury, is one of the oldest known barrows in the country, dating back to around 3,200BC.  Its two ends have been ploughed away and destroyed, but the remains of one of the Beaker folk, migrants into Britain in 2,500BC who were notable for the beaker shape of their pottery, have been found in the barrow. Silbury Hill, a vast chalk mound 16 miles from Stonehenge, is not strictly a barrow but is a man-made mound from the same, Neolithic period and can be seen from many of the barrows that post-date it.  Despite various attempts to excavate it over the years, and despite a common assumption over the years that it must be a burial mound, its purpose is still a mystery. source: Wiltshire Web .","Wiltshire farmer Tim Daw, 52, is building mound in field near Marlborough .

A virtuoso violinist driven to suicide during the trial of a choirmaster who abused her has inspired a friend to sail the Atlantic and raise money to help a rape support charity. Frances Andrade, 48, died from an overdose taken before she knew Michael Brewer and his ex-wife Kay, both 68, were convicted of six counts of indecent assault last February. Graham Wyllie's daughter Emily, 15, was . taught by the talented musician at a school in Bramley, Surrey, up until her death, and he has sailed from the Canary Islands to Saint Lucia in her memory. Mrs Andrade's plight moved Britain when she killed herself during a trial where she was accused of inventing Brewer's abuse while she was at Chetham's School of Music in Manchester. Much loved: Frances Andrade, 48, who was abused by a choirmaster, killed herself after she gave evidence against him. Graham Wyllie, right, sailed the Atlantic in her memory to raise money for a rape crisis charity . Following one emotional exchange, Mrs Andrade told the court: ‘This feels like rape all over again.’ Shameful: Michael Brewer's refusal to admit what he had done led to Frances having to face him in the court, which she said 'felt like rape again' Her friend Graham Wyllie, 55, was inspired to join a crew on the 2013 Atlantic Rally for Cruisers, raising cash to help the Rape And Sexual Abuse Support Centre in Guildford. 'We became close through her teaching, and my daughter Emily became extremely close to her. They became great friends,' he said. 'Fran . kept her ordeal all to herself. She had a effervescent personality and . extremely outgoing. We had no idea about what had happened to her. There . was nothing at that would give you the impression she had suffered. 'But . in the year leading up to the trial she lost a lot of weight and had . been into hospital. It is only afterwards that I realised she had . attempted suicide. 'She was incredibly brave. When you stand up to . a man like that, and an institution like that, you must feel like you . have the whole world against you. 'This was very much in memory of Fran, and will hopefully help other victims of abuse. Sadly it is prevalent. 'There . are a lot of vulnerable people out there who become victims. I hope . this will bring some help and attention to their plight'. Mr Wyllie has already raised £4,000 but hopes to raise even more cash for the 'inspirational' woman. Tough: Graham and the rest of the crew crossed the ocean in 18 days, where the boat was battered by six metre waves and had its front sail ripped . Moved: Graham Wyllie said crossing the Atlantic (pictured) will hopefully do some good for those who have suffered sexual abuse or rape . Race: Mr Wyllie joined a crew on the 2013 Atlantic Rally for Cruisers, raising cash to help the Rape And Sexual Abuse Support Centre in Guildford . Disgraced choirmaster Brewer, and his ex-wife Kay indecently assaulted former pupil Frances over a number of years. The jury was not told about her death until they had returned their verdicts. He was jailed for six years and his Mrs Brewer for 21 months. Virtuoso: Mrs Andrade inspired young people in her music teaching but in her death has also encouraged abuse victims to speak out . Officers from Greater Manchester Police said since her death at least 30 other women have been 'spurred on' by her bravery and contacted them about alleged attacks at Chetham's and other institutions. Mrs Andrade had also suffered abuse from the age of eight, she told the court, she was repeatedly raped by an uncle, her home life made worse by the death of her adoptive father, whom she dearly loved, at the age of 12. The following year she won a place at Chetham’s, where she fell into the clutches of Brewer, a man with a predilection for his young, female pupils. At the age of 18, his wife joined in the abuse, telling Frances that she ‘owed her’ as she indecently assaulted her. No doubt to dull the pain, the teenager drank and self-harmed. But that picture of the tormented young Frances is not one her loved-ones find easy to match with the successful, ebullient woman she became. However, the trial brought her pain back and she was unable to cope, but it is hoped she will inspire others to get help. Graham Wyllie, whose boat was hit with six metre waves and its front sail ripped by force nine gales during the 18 day Atlantic crossing said it was worth it. He said: 'It was an opportunity to reflect on how lucky we were to know Fran. She is an inspiration'. Probe: More than 30 former female pupils of Chetham's School of Music (pictured) have reported abuse to police since Frances' death . Sonja Freebody, from the Rape and Sexual Abuse Support Centre (RASASC) Mr Wyllie is supporting said: 'Graham has been wonderful in raising funding for us.  It is very sad that the loss of Frances inspired him to raise funds for our centre, however we are really grateful and delighted with his efforts. 'One in four people will suffer rape or sexual abuse during their life time and it is still not openly discussed.  The majority of cases are not reported to the Police.

Waste: Soldiers have been told to stop 'firing off' unused rounds of ammunition at the end of training exercises . Cash-strapped army officers have ordered soldiers to cut the amount of ammunition they use. Bullets unused during training exercises must now be returned to stores to help save money, instead of being fired off by troops. The army penny-pinching emerged as leaked documents showed the Ministry of Defence has wasted millions of pounds on a botched computer system. The armed forces have been forced to save billions by cutting troop numbers, equipment budgets and deployments. Now senior officers have told soldiers to stop the practice of firing off left over bullets at the end of training exercises, the Daily Telegraph reported. One squaddie revealed in a letter to Soldier magazine revealed that despite the financial crisis faced by the military, officers still tell them to ‘start bombing up, we can’t take any ammo back' even when bullets are sealed in boxes. Officers claim that it is ‘too much paperwork when we return them’ ‘it’s good training to feel what full automatic feels like’. Lt Col Dom Cooper, of the Army’s ammunition management department, replied: ‘It is unfortunate that some unit personnel appear to have engaged in ammunition “firing off”. ‘Such behaviour is wasteful and there can be no excuse for it.’ The MoD said the ‘firing off’ Is ‘wasteful’ and has been banned. But the ministry faced fresh criticism about waste over its bungled handling of an IT system to recuit thousands of new reservists and full-time personnel. The Recruitment Partnering Project, a £1.3 billion scheme intended to enable the Army to recruit online, is almost two years behind schedule and will not be fully operational until April 2015 at the earliest, The Times said. Up to £15.5 million has been spent on the computer system, but according to the newspaper, the problems are so serious that Defence Secretary Philip Hammond is considering spending nearly £50 million on a new solution. According to a confidential report by technology research company Gartner, the Army's recruitment wing picked the wrong bidder to build the IT system after failing in 2011 to challenge an MoD policy that favoured the less suitable of two competing offers. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond has been urged to get a grip on the bungled IT project which has already cost millions . The project management team was inexperienced and under-resourced and when delays started the Army failed to take charge and put in a suitable contingency plan. Mr Hammond was being urged to pay Capita, the MoD's partner in the project, £47.7 million to build a new IT platform. A briefing note sent from the MoD's director general finance David Williams to Mr Hammond in December recommended scrapping the flawed IT system and paying Capita to build its own model. He wrote: ‘If the ICT hosting solution is not put in place then the MoD risks not gaining the appropriate number of recruits needed. Given recent criticism of army recruitment . . . and the use of reserves, this would lead to further negative media reporting and reputational damage for MoD.’ Another briefing note revealed that the MoD will incur additional costs of £1 million a month until the IT problem is resolved. Shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker said: ‘This leaked report points to the latest series of catastrophic failures at the Ministry of Defence on David Cameron's watch. The Army is being cut from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020 while the newly-renamed Army Reserve - formerly the Territorial Army - is being expanded from 19,000 to 30,000 . ‘Labour warned that the Government was taking risks with Britain's security by not fixing the reserve recruitment crisis before reducing numbers in the regular Army. We specifically raised the worrying IT problems and Capita's performance as causes for concern. But the Government recklessly pressed ahead. ‘Now we learn that the problems were worse than anyone thought and still haven't been fixed. The blame for this latest fiasco - which is wasting £1m of taxpayers money every month - lies squarely with government. ‘Philip Hammond needs to get a grip and sort this shambles out.’ The Army is being cut from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020 while the newly-renamed Army Reserve - formerly the Territorial Army - is being expanded from 19,000 to 30,000. In a paper lodged in Parliament in December Mr Hammond said that recruitment in 2013 ‘has been well below historic levels’ and acknowledged there were problems with the IT system. An MoD spokeswoman said: ‘In December last year we acknowledged a number of problems with the Army and Capita recruitment partnership. Ministers have gripped these problems and put in place a number of fixes to correct the issues that had emerged. ‘As we have previously said, in the medium-term we are building a new IT platform that will be ready early next year and in the short term we are introducing work-arounds and mitigation measures to the old IT platform to simplify the application process. ‘With an improved Army recruitment website, streamlined medicals and an increase in the number of recruiting staff, recruits should see a much improved experience at the end of this month.’","Officers complain about paperwork for returning ammunition to stores .

Victim: This elderly woman - 'Joan' - was so badly beaten up by a gang of muggers that she was too scared to tell anyone what had happened for five days . An 80-year-old grandmother was beaten up by a gang of muggers after she told them smoking was bad for their health, it was revealed today. The pensioner, who has been named only as ‘Joan’, was on a shopping trip to buy groceries when she was ambushed by the men and beaten so savagely that she was too frightened to reveal her ordeal for five days. During the assault in Haughton Green, Greater Manchester, the yobs told her: ‘Don’t talk to us like that’ - then punched her in the face whilst she was on her knees, begging them to stop. Despite extensive bruising the widow managed to stagger home after the assault, but was so traumatised she refused to step out into the street again - for fear the yobs might be waiting for her outside to give her a second beating. The alarm was only raised when she was paid a visit by her daughter Karen Priestley, 44, who was left shocked at the bruising on her face. She posted a picture of the pensioner’s injuries on Facebook in an appeal for help in catching the culprits - and this was spotted by police. Today, detectives investigating the attack issued the image of the woman’s injuries in the hope it might shame the yobs into turning themselves in. Mrs Priestley said: ‘My mum is very muddled and frightened now. She didn’t want anybody to know about what happened but and now the whole world knows. Shock: The alarm was only raised when Joan was paid a visit by her 44-year-old daughter Karen Priestley . ‘She is embarrassed and frightened and she doesn’t need it.

I just want to get the word out that these people are around and they need catching and stopping. They could have killed my mother.’ Joan, a retired hotel kitchen worker, was attacked at the start of the New Year after she had gone shopping at Tesco on Mancunian Way in Haughton Green. As she walked down this road she was approached by the four men, one of whom asked her for a cigarette. The pensioner said she did not have any - but the gang asked her for money. They then rifled through the victim’s pockets before punching her a ‘number of times’ to her head, knocking her to her knees. While on her knees they continued to . punch her before running off onto the playing fields at the rear of . Mancunian Road. Nothing was stolen. Scene: The unnamed victim, 79, was attacked as she walked home from a shopping trip to Tesco in Haughton Green (pictured), Manchester.

I phoned my mum up and said I . couldn’t go and then a few days later I went round to take her some . shopping. ‘When I went in . she had dark glasses and she eventually took them off and said she had . been mugged. Her two eyes were black and I nearly died with shock. I was . horrified. ‘For an . 80-year-old woman to be attacked by four lads - it’s disgusting.

Two of them hit her . and she fell to her knees and they ran off. A lady was speaking to her . after the attack and she said “watch they don’t see where you live”. ‘She . was terrified after that that they would come back and she hasn’t been . out at all. The bad thing is if they have done it already - they will . probably do it again. ‘My . 11-year-old daughter was in tears when she saw her gran. It was just . horrendous.

A lawyer defending a woman who was caught drink-driving while her small child was at home alone has accused Madeleine McCann's parents of child neglect. In what has been described as an 'outrageous' slur on the missing girl's parents, defence lawyer Gareth Morgan compared them unfavourably to his client, who left her five-year-old son at home by himself before being arrested after she crashed her car at traffic lights. He told magistrates at Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales: 'The parents of Madeleine McCann were guilty of child neglect for leaving their little girl much longer than my client. They were never prosecuted.' Kate and Gerry McCann, pictured, were accused of child neglect by a lawyer defending a drink-driving mother . The lawyer said that his client, whose son has Asperger's, was ashamed of what she had done. The 44-year-old defendant, who cannot be named, hit the back of another car at traffic lights. When police followed her home, she told them they couldn't arrest her because her son was by himself in the house, and they found the child asleep under a blanket on the sofa. The court heard that the woman was more than two-and-a-half times over the limit when she drove to a cashpoint machine just before midnight. On her way home, she ran into a car driven by Bronnie-May Dunn, 21, which was stopped at traffic lights. Miss Dunn suffered head injuries in the crash but magistrates heard that the driver shouted at her, saying it was her fault. The woman admitted child neglect, drink-driving and leaving an accident and was given a 12-month supervision order, 120 hours of unpaid work, a 22-month driving ban and told to attend a course. Today a friend of the McCanns, whose daughter went missing in Portugal in May 2007 while they ate in a nearby restaurant with friends, hit out at Mr Morgan's comments. Resort: Madeleine McCann went missing from her apartment in The Ocean Club in Praia Da Luz in 2007 . British police are hoping to go to Portugal to interview three new 'prime suspects' in the hunt for Madeleine, pictured . The friend told the Mirror: 'If Kate and Gerry were guilty of child neglect, and they were absolutely not, they would have been dealt with. 'As it is, there are two police inquiries in two different countries trying to find out what happened to Madeleine, and comments made by a lawyer in an unrelated case is offensive, outrageous and inaccurate.' It was revealed today that Portuguese police are under mounting pressure to give British detectives access to the three 'prime suspects' wanted for questioning over the abduction of Madeleine McCann. The Crown Prosecution Service has sent them a second 'International Letter of Request' after identifying three burglars who were operating in the Algarve resort where the McCanns were staying. Analysis of mobile phone records at the time show that they made a high number of calls at around the time the small girl was taken. It is now known that between January and May 2007 there had been a four-fold increase in the number of burglaries in the area around the Praia da Luz resort where the family from Rothley, Leicestershire, was staying. Police said in October that in the 17 days before she disappeared there was one burglary and one attempted burglary in the block where the McCann family were staying.","Defence lawyer Gareth Morgan compared them to his drink-driving client .

Understaffed A&E departments are spending more than £80million a year hiring locum doctors, figures show. The average casualty unit is paying £750,000 annually for temporary medics to plug rota gaps, with some shelling out more than £4million. A&E is in the grip of a recruitment crisis with most junior doctors put off by the intense work, antisocial hours and low pay. High cost: Understaffed A&E departments are spending more than £80million a year hiring locum doctors . At the same time rising numbers of trained casualty doctors are quitting the NHS to work abroad where salaries are higher and standards of care better. Hospitals are having to rely increasingly on expensive locums who tend to be less competent, more inexperienced and prone to mistakes as they are unfamiliar with equipment. Figures obtained by Labour show hospitals spent £83million on locums last year, up from £74million in 2011/12 and £51.6million in 2009/10. North West London hospitals spent £4.3million, followed by £3.8million by Barking, Havering and Redbridge in Essex. Expensive locums: Hospitals are having to rely increasingly on temporary medics who tend to be less competent, more inexperienced and prone to mistakes as they are unfamiliar with equipment (file picture) Last week, the Mail revealed some A&E units were paying GPs £1,500 a shift to work evenings and weekends . This latter trust has the highest number of vacant A&E posts in the country and 13 out of 21 consultant jobs are currently empty. Last week the Mail revealed some short-staffed A&E units were paying GPs £1,500 a shift to work evenings and weekends. Concern: Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the NHS's locum bill is 'spiralling out of control' Some 40 per cent of casualties now employ family doctors to deal with less urgent cases. GPs have been able to opt-out of working evenings and weekends since 2004 and this is thought to have triggered a surge in patients at A&E. Dr Cliff Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&E doctors, said: ‘It’s about the experience and training of locums compared to permanent staff, and the cost. ‘If you were to ask any chief executive or patient groups whether they’d rather continue employing short-term, variable locums or double the number of consultants you can be pretty sure what they’d say. ‘These people won’t have done the same training or have the same brand experience as doctors in permanent posts.’ Locums include full-time doctors doing extra shifts as well as those employed with agencies – who can be less competent. NHS officials say the next few weeks will be particularly busy for A&E units due to the cold weather. Last week three hospitals – Milton Keynes, Peterborough and Cambridge – warned they were running out of beds. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham accused David Cameron of leaving the NHS with a ‘dangerous shortage’ of A&E doctors and a locum bill which is ‘spiralling out of control’. ‘This Government is guilty of gross mismanagement of the NHS,’ he said. ‘They are paying more for an A&E service which is getting worse by the week. And things have got so bad that many doctors are deciding to quit.’","A&E units are spending more than £80million a year hiring locum doctors .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 03:56 EST, 14 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 04:11 EST, 14 January 2014 . More than 66,000 families with more five or more children rely on jobless benefits, it emerged today. One in five of the households receives Jobseekers' Allowance while more than one in 10 is paid income support. However the total amount of money the large families can receive is now being limited to £26,000, as ministers come under pressure to cut the benefits cap by as much as a third. Welfare: New figures reveal the raft of benefits claimed by families with five or more children . New figures reveal that in May 2012 there were 66,580 families with five or more children receiving out-of-work benefits. Of these, 13,670 were paid Jobseekers' Allowance, 7,900 received Incapacity Benefit or Severe Disablement Allowance and 41,580 were paid Income Support, received by people working fewer than 16 hours a week. Some 9,110 households also received Employment and Support Allowance while Pension Credit was also paid to 600 homes. Some households will receive more than one of these benefits. Figures released last week show that almost 10,000 families with five or more children had been hit by the £26,000 benefit cap. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: ‘Capping benefit at average earnings is forecast, by reducing the large benefit amounts previously paid to households, to save £85 million this year and around £140 million next year. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said three in four people back the benefits cap . ‘What is more, some 19,000 potentially capped claimants have moved into work, where paying tax and national insurance contributions brings a further benefit to the Exchequer.’ The cap affects income from the main out-of-work benefits including Jobseeker’s Allowance, Income Support, Employment and Support Allowance, Universal Credit and other benefits such as Housing Benefit, Child Benefit and Child Tax Credit and Carer’s Allowance. However, households are exempt from the cap if someone living their receives one of a number of other benefits such as Disability Living Allowance, Personal Independence Payment, Industrial Injuries Benefit and the War Disablement Pension. Mr Duncan Smith came under pressure yesterday from Tory MPs to cut the benefit cap from £26,000 to as little as £18,000. In the Commons he insisted the policy is ‘under review’ and is backed by three in four members of the public. The coalition’s decision to cap the total amount of income a family can receive in benefits has proved to be one of the most popular policies ever devised. The government set the maximum amount that a household can receive in benefits at £26,000 – the median average annual income of a working family. It means couples, with or without children, can claim up to £500-a-week while a single adult without children can receive £350-a-week in benefits. But many Tory MPs have argued it is still equivalent to the take-home pay of someone earning £35,000. Jobcentre: Ministers hope that capping benefits will persuade thousands of people to find work instead . Tory MP Andrew Bridgen complained it was much higher than the median average £22,130 annual salary in his North West Leicestershire constituency, giving most workers take home pay of only £17,800. Last week it emerged that since the cap’s introduction in April last year, 33,000 families had had their benefits curbed. It included 150 who received more than the take-home pay of someone on a salary of £65,000-a-year. In the Commons Mr Bridgen said his constituents were astonished by the figures. He urged Mr Duncan Smith to ‘persevere with this policy of a benefits cap and also review the level at which the cap, which is currently considerably more than the average post tax income in my constituency’. Reducing the cap to £20,000 would be the equivalent to take home pay of someone in work on a salary of around £25,000.","New figures reveal details of the welfare payments given to large families .

Two brothers have been jailed for seven years after using their printing business to churn out £1.3 million worth of fake £10 banknotes over their Christmas break. Businessmen Amrit and Prem Karra, from Walsall, West Midlands, were the 'masterminds and architects' behind the highly sophisticated counterfeiting operation, Birmingham Crown Court heard. Sentencing the brothers and two other men who also took part in the scam, Judge Richard Bond said they had undermined the integrity of the UK’s financial system. Amrit (left) and Prem Karra (right) have been jailed after printing £1.3 million worth of fake £10 banknotes . The Karras and their brothers-in-law, Rajiv Kumar and Yash Mahey, printed the notes over the festive period . The Karra brothers and their brothers-in-law, Rajiv Kumar and Yash Mahey, were all convicted of conspiracy to produce counterfeit notes following a five-week trial which ended in December. The trial heard Amrit Karra and Prem Karra, from Walsall; Kumar, of West Bromwich; and Mahey, of Handsworth, Birmingham, even worked through the night to print fake £10 notes worth at least £1.27million. Amrit Karra, 45, Prem Karra, 43, Kumar, 40, and Mahey, 44, used specialist paper, inks and foil to run off the near-perfect forgeries at a print-works in Hockley, Birmingham. Judge Bond told them: ‘People who commit offences of this type must realise that those who counterfeit currency must expect long sentences of imprisonment. ‘In this case the amount of money produced and disseminated into general circulation was enormous. ‘Production of counterfeit notes undermines the whole economy of the country. Essentially it undermines the whole integrity of the currency system. ‘It is so serious that only lengthy custodial sentences can be justified.’ Brothers-in-law Rajiv Kumar (left) and Yash Mahey (right) were jailed for four-and-a-half years . Jailing both Mahey and Kumar for four-and-a-half years, and barring the Karra brothers from acting as company directors, Judge Bond said the offences were motivated by greed. He told the defendants: ‘All four of you knew what would happen to the notes. ‘You knew that if you were caught it would affect your wives and your children and other members of your immediate family. ‘Knowing, as you did, the consequences of being caught, you ignored your families. The risks taken in this case were high and you must personally take the blame.’ The National Crime Agency (NCA) said Karra Design and Print had legitimate business contracts but the four men had used the firm’s computers and machinery to counterfeit notes in late 2010 and early 2011 - over the Christmas and New Year break. The vast majority of the ‘extremely high quality’ notes even had individual serial numbers, and were only identified as fakes as they were sorted by banks to be loaded into cash machines. Although the notes’ holograms were easily identifiable as bogus, the other security features were so convincing that only 10 per cent of them were spotted by members of the public. A spokesman for the NCA said the men were caught after 'intelligence' was passed on from the NCA's National Central Office for the Suppression of Counterfeit Currency. He said: 'The NCA then used traditional investigation methods including analysis of communication data, phone data, and numberplate recognition to pinpoint where they were working.' In a statement issued after the case, . the NCA said forensic analysis of the printing firm’s equipment showed . exactly when it was being used and what was being produced. Mobile . phone data and automatic number plate recognition evidence were also . critical to the success of the investigation, an NCA spokesman said. The National Crime Agency said forensic analysis of the printing firm's equipment showed exactly when it was being used and what was being produced . Phone data and number plate recognition evidence were also critical to the success of the investigation . Lawyers for the Karra brothers argued that the conspiracy was a response to financial trouble at the printing firm. David Emanuel, defending Prem Karra, described the ‘one-off’ printing of counterfeit notes as a very misguided attempt to save the business, and said his client was someone who had been highly regarded within the local business community. Franco Tizzano, defending Amrit Karra, told the court during mitigation: ‘It is a great tragedy that someone with such positive qualities, who has worked all his adult life and was very committed to his family, finds himself before the court.’ The fake notes have been found all over the country but the most significantly affected areas were the West Midlands, London and Kent. Lawyers for the Karra brothers argued that the conspiracy was a response to financial trouble at the printing firm . Richard Warner, NCA Birmingham Branch Commander, said: ‘These men ran a sophisticated operation that posed a significant threat to the UK economy at the time. ‘By working closely with industry experts our officers stopped them causing more damage. ‘Counterfeiting is not a victimless crime. It takes money out of the pockets of individuals and businesses.’ A Bank of England spokesperson said: ‘The Bank works closely with the National Crime Agency in the fight against counterfeiting. We are grateful for their work in pursuing this case to a successful conclusion. ‘Those individuals who engage in counterfeiting should know they will be found and punished for their crimes.’","Amrit and Prem Karra, from Walsall, jailed for seven years after court hears they were the 'masterminds and architects' behind the scheme .

In custody: Richard Magdayo Dahan, 40, being held at the Clark County jail without bail pending a court appearance this week on a first-degree murder charge in the recent slaying of his 28-year-old wife, Daisy Casalta Dahan . Richard Dahan waited in the lobby of a police station before telling investigators that Daisy Dahan was sitting at the kitchen table when he attacked her with a serrated chef knife that got tangled in her hair. He said he hit his wife several times in the head with a meat cleaver and stabbed her torso with a filet knife. 'Richard said he felt that killing Daisy was the only thing left for him to do,' investigators said in the police report. 'He said he felt he had no other options.' 'Richard said that if he was able to go back in time to the point where he took the first knife out of the dishwasher, he would kill Daisy again,' investigators said. Richard Dahan told police he was a kidney transplant recipient in failing health who lost his job as a chef at a Las Vegas Strip casino resort. Murder location: Officers immediately took Dahan into custody and searched his apartment in the 6500 block of Vegas Drive.

Since she was born, Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor has suffered from esotropia - a condition which means both eyes do not look in the same direction. If left untreated it can cause serious vision problems. Successful: Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor's transformation was first evident when the Earl and Countess of Wessex, attended a racing event at Royal Ascot in December . But the Queen’s ten-year-old . grand-daughter is understood to have had corrective surgery on the . advice of doctors – and her transformation during a recent visit to . Ascot suggested it had been a success. It could also be seen as she accompanied her parents, Prince Edward and his wife, Sophie, to church at Sandringham on Christmas Day. Although Buckingham Palace has declined to comment on her health, it is understood Louise, who in 2011 was a bridesmaid for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, was first operated on when she was just a toddler. Condition: Lady Louise has suffered from esotropia since birth - a condition which turns one eye outwards . As is often the case, however, it soon became clear that she would require further treatment when older. Details of the surgery or whether it was carried out on the NHS or privately, have not been released. But in most cases a paediatric ophthalmologist would carefully move the position of the muscles on the eye in order to make it easier to control. Louise, who is tenth in line to the throne, was a much longed-for child for Edward and Sophie, who suffered the heartbreak of an ectopic pregnancy two years before she was conceived. She was born four weeks prematurely in an emergency caesarean operation during which Sophie's life was in peril. She lost nine pints of blood through internal bleeding and was said to be just minutes from death. Condition: The Queen's youngest granddaughter, pictured at the the Royal Wedding between the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, is believed to have been first operated on when she was just a toddler . To Sophie's distress her daughter who weighed just 4lb 9oz, had to be transferred almost immediately for specialist care at St George's Hospital, in Tooting, South London, while she had to remain 35 miles away in Frimley Hospital, Surrey, for another 16 days. However she has since grown up to be a happy, healthy child who attends a local day school and bears an uncanny resemblance to her grandmother, the Queen, at the same age. The two enjoy a particularly close relationship and often go riding together along the with Wessex’s son, James, Viscount Severn, who is six. Royal family: Louise, who is tenth in line to the throne, was a much longed-for child for Edward and Sophie . The monarch is also frequent visitor to the family home, Bagshot Park, which is a short drive from Windsor Castle. Although she has pointedly refused to talk about her daughter’s vision problems in public, it is believed that they inspired the Countess to become patron of the charity Vision 2020 and Global Ambassador of The International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness (IAPB). Last year the Countess undertook a visit to India to publicise their work, visiting the ORBIS Flying Eye Hospital, where she witnessed patients undergoing sight-saving surgery. Lady Louise Windsor attending a Sunday Church Service at St Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham . There are six muscles that control eye movement, four that move the eye up and down and two that move it from side to side. All these muscles must be working in coordination in order for the brain to see a single image. When one or more of these muscles do not operate properly, the eyes may not be aligned, causing the condition. Esotropia is mostly seen in children, who develop the condition from a young age, but can also be affect adults. Squinting or frequent rubbing of the eyes is a common side-effect. As the disorder progresses, the eyes will start to turn out when looking . at close objects as well as those in the distance. If left untreated, . the eye may turn out continually, having a significant impact on vision.

Rural villagers say they have been cut off by Royal Mail after a Post Office health and safety boss ruled their road was too muddy. Royal Mail health and safety chiefs have ruled that the country lanes in the villages of Owensfield and Holtsfield near Swansea are too 'slippery and dangerous' and have banned deliveries in this area, following a . complaint by a postman saying the trips are a 'muddy hell'. Ray Laurence, 63, who lives in the area said: 'It is crazy that a bit of rain can stop the Royal Mail. 'It does get muddy in the winter, but it's no muddier now than in other winters. Householders in the village of Murton, Swansea, have been cut off from mail deliveries because the roads are too 'unsafe' due to mud . Muddy conditions don't often stop the Royal Mail, which has a policy to deliver despite harsh and severe weather . 'Delivery drivers from other companies had no trouble dropping off parcels before Christmas and our regular postman knows the route well, but this was a complaint for a relief postman.' Laurence's neighbour Dai Morris, 64, said: 'I walk along the lanes every day and it is absolutely fine with a pair of wellies. 'Some people would rather see all the fields covered in concrete and tarmac rather than get a bit muddy. 'There's nothing more natural than the British weather.' Ray Laurence who lives in one of the villages has been leading the campaign to re-instate the postal service in their area . A Royal Mail spokesperson said: 'We suspended deliveries after a postman reported that the path was . extremely muddy and slippery as a result of the inclement weather. 'Deliveries . were suspended following a visit by a senior health and safety manager . after a postman reported problems walking along a muddy woodland path. 'Our postmen and women go out in all . weather conditions including wind, rain, snow and ice. 'It is always a . last resort if we decide not to deliver to a specific address or . addresses. 'The safety of our colleagues is paramount.  We will only suspend deliveries if the safety of our postmen and women is at risk.' Villagers are running a campaign in the villages to try and lift the ban. This isn't the first time that the Royal Mail has not delivered due to complaints by postmen. In June 2012, Royal Mail suspended deliveries during 'adverse wet weather conditions' after a postman slipped on algae and moss on the pavement and broke his shoulder. In October of last year, a cheque wasn't delivered to a business owner because a spider the size of a ten pence piece was blocking the garden gate. The weather conditions in the UK over the past winter have been some of the most extreme on record, with some places in Britain having an entire month's rainfall in the first week of the month. When asked about the recent weather and affects to the Royal Mail's service 'Whereas the recent bad weather did not significantly impact Royal Mail’s service and network, it did cause some limited disruption at a local level – mainly due to flooding. 'The business is well accustomed to implementing contingency measures in preparation for and response to extreme weather events.' Aaron Piper, a former postman, who delivered post during the 2012/13 winter, one of the coldest and snowiest for the UK in years, said: 'I ruined my knee running during the snow on my first week. 'I had to run to get my rounds done in time, because they didn't pay overtime. 'On the other hand, if it's sunny, people expect you to be happy, but there are dogs everywhere and you're just too hot.

A prominent California marine biologist was sentenced Monday after pleading guilty to violating the Marine Mammal Protection Act by feeding killer whales in the wild, a misdemeanor. Nancy Black was sentenced to three years of probation, $12,500 in fines and 300 hours of community service. Black, who runs a popular whale watching tour on Monterey Bay, had pleaded guilty to one count of violating the federal act when she fed whale blubber to orcas in the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary in 2004 and 2005. Nancy Black: A noted marine biologist who operates a whale-watching business was sentenced to three years of probation for illegally feeding killer whales in a Monterey Bay marine sanctuary . Black broke into tears as she addressed United States District Court Judge Edward J. Davila on Monday. 'I made a mistake,' she said. 'I've learned a big lesson.' Since her crime, she added, she has been through 'the worst nightmare I could ever imagine,' referring to the grueling case. 'It's a sad event when a good scientist falls off the path,' Davila responded. 'This is your life. This is your passion. These creatures rely on you.' Guilty: Nancy Black, who runs a popular whale watching tour on Monterey Bay, was found guilty to one count of violating the Marine Mammal Protection Act . Prosecutor Christopher Hale said Black's crime raised the danger that the whales would come to associate humans with food. 'When wild animals are fed by humans, they learn to lose their natural wariness,' he said. 'That can lead to devastating effect.'' Although Hale said he had never heard of a person being attacked by a whale, he added, 'Who wants to be Patient Zero to be eaten by a killer whale because they're chumming for them.' Federal prosecutors initially accused Black of feeding orcas in 2004 and 2005, altering a videotape of her encounters with whales then lying about it. Do not feed the whales! Federal prosecutors initially accused Black of feeding orcas in 2004 and 2005 and altering a videotape of her encounters with whales and then lying about it . Black's guilty plea resulted in federal prosecutors dropping all the other charges and not seeking jail time. The marine biologist's work has appeared on PBS, National Geographic and Animal Planet. She also operates Monterey Bay Whale Watch. She has also worked with federal agencies on the study of whales, including the National Marine Mammal Laboratory, which is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Black's attorney Larry Biegel said for scientific research, his client had collected a piece of gray whale blubber and tied it to rope in order to film the orcas eating. Well known: The marine biologist's work has appeared on PBS, National Geographic and Animal Planet. She also operates Monterey Bay Whale Watch . The case has been closely monitored by the whale watching community, and Biegel feared that because Black has been ordered to maintain a distance of 100 yards from whales that her business competitors might seek to report her if a whale happened to come closer than that. 'Whale watching in Monterey Bay is a wonderful business, but it is a business,' Biegel said. 'And it is intensely competitive. There is tension there that could be used adversely.'","Black admitted to feeding a killer whale in April 2004 and again in April 2005 while operating her whale-watching business .

An elderly lady's hopeful campaign to bring out the best in a deprived road in Birmingham, dubbed Benefits Street, ends in failure after a lacklustre effort from neighbours and even threats of violence. Despite the enthusiasm of a local, known only as Sue, who enters notorious James Turner Street, Birmingham, into the Britain in Bloom competition, the community fails to impress the judges in an episode of the Channel 4 documentary to be broadcast this evening. Ahead of the competition, Sue told the cameras: 'I moved in 20 years ago, and older people said there was a queue to get into these houses. Scroll down for video . Campaign: Sue's hopes to bring out the best in those living in the street with a gardening competition failed . Hopes: The pensioner entered the notorious James Turner Street into the Britain in Bloom competition . In the spirit of things: One resident decked the front of her home with hanging baskets for the judges . 'Everyone had a tree in their front garden, and everyone was planted up. That is what it could be again.' And some residents made the effort to recapture the old days ahead of the judges' arrival. One, called . Hycainth, decking her paved front garden in hanging baskets. But other elements were less able to draw the judges' praise, including Deidre 'White Dee' Kelly, 42, who declined to install any flowers, or her companion 'Black Dee', who wondered aloud why Sue was bothering. And, although the judges were not around to see it, immediately after Sue had shown them around the street the camera crews were confronted by two angry men. In bloom: Some residents made an effort - but others were filmed asking why Sue was bothering . Any interest? Sue goes door to door with information about the competition . Attempts: In one scene, the pensioner can be seen walking the street with a selection of greenery . Opposition: 'White Dee' declined to participate in the Britain in Bloom competition . Waving a hammer, one of them made threatening remarks to the people filming the documentary, and had to be placated by other residents. In a ceremony shown at the end of the programme, it was revealed that James Turner Street had come eighth in the local round of the competition. The residents, however, seemed pleased with the achievement and celebrated in a ceremony at the village hall. Sue made clear that she would maintain her aspirations for the road - which she said was once extremely desirable - by entering it again next year, despite the difficulties caused by many of the residents moving to other properties so often. Inspection: The judges, and Sue, walk around the area and observe resident's rather lackluster efforts . Certificate: The group came eighth in the competition . However, this too was blighted by accusations that Gerard, White Dee's six-year-old son, had bitten another child. His mother forcefully denied that it could of happen - admitting that while 'he may not be perfect', 'only animals bite'.

Happy reunion: Mary Plumb was recently reunited with her family's 100-pound African-spurred tortoise after it traveled 30 miles away and lived on the lam for a full year . An Arizona family has finally been reunited with their giant African tortoise after it wandered 30 miles from home and lived a year on the lam. The sulcata, or African-spurred tortoise, named Samson took off from an exotic animal farm owned by George and Mary Plumb in November 2012. After traveling 30 miles in about six months, the 100-pound reptile spent another half year with a foster owner before an online ad and a microchip implant recently helped the Plumbs get him back. According to Mary Plumb, Samson’s saga began when someone caring for him and the dozens of other animals her family keeps near Casa Grande left a gate open. Plumb believes Samson first sauntered over to a nearby alfalfa farm before making his 6-month, 30-mile trek to Maricopa, where he was adopted by Intel engineer and amateur herpetologist Jonathan Grove. Sulcatas are herbivores and originally come from the hot, dry grasslands south of the Sahara Desert in Africa. They can live up to 200 years. While known for their friendly and gentle natures, they can grow up to 3 feet long and tip the scale at 150 pounds. After another six months, Grove renewed his search for Samson’s—who he’d renamed Eddie—owners. Run for it: Samson escaped from an open gate on the Plumb's exotic animal farm in November 2012 . Living on the edge: Samson first traveled 30 miles from home before being taken in by a foster owner. Six months later, he would finally be reunited with the Plumbs . African spurred tortoises live in sub Saharan African grasslands. They are herbivores that live largely on grasses. The reptiles can measure up to 36 inches long and weigh 240 pounds. They are the thrid largest tortoises in the world and can live over 100 years. ‘I went all over Hidden Valley handing out fliers, (but) basically all the people who called couldn't describe Eddie,’ Grove said. ‘Eddie's shell was so perfect that he was probably worth a lot of money. I really didn't want somebody to come and flip him and put him on Craigslist.’ Meanwhile, the Maricopa Monitor posts Eddie as ‘pet of the week’ in the middle of November. It turns out Grove's hunt was a little off. Just west of Casa Grande, news of a missing tortoise rings alarm bells for George and Mary Plumb. They can't find their tortoise anywhere. ‘We kind of gave up on the big male,’ George said. ‘I assumed someone picked him up. We didn't worry too much because he was microchipped.’ George drove to Maricopa to inspect Eddie, and the big sulcata immediately responded to his voice. The microchip embedded in the animal's skin confirmed Eddie was actually Samson. So, how does a tortoise wander 30-some miles in six months? ‘They are very big explorers, especially the males,’ Mary said. The four tortoises at her home like to burrow under fences. A lovely time had by all: Samson not only rejoined the plumbs, but also his lifelong pal Goliath . 'They are an instant love¿: Mary Plumb hopes to will the long-lived pets to her grandchildren one day . The Plumb family owns a menagerie of animals on their property just west of Casa Grande. Neighborhood kids and children from churches and schools come to see the animals, more than 73 in all. In addition to the tortoises, the Plumbs own a wide array of peacocks, guinea hens, chickens and snakes. But the male tortoises are special. George rescued one 19 years ago from a busy road, effectively launching his turtle obsession. The large land-crawlers even have mates. In August, 12 babies hatched from eggs burrowed in the ground. The couple intends to give the hatchlings to their future grandchildren. They don't even have grandchildren yet, but their four teenage boys know what's expected down the road. But Mary’s not too worried they'll stray from the family tradition. ‘They are an instant love,’ she said.","A sulcata, or African spurred tortoise, went missing from an Arizona farm in November 2012 .

He also claims he was forced to transfer £4,800 into the bank account of the lapdancers’ manager, Charlotte Devaney, while in the vehicle. Mr Woodman, from Cheltenham, denied basing his claims on the Guy Ritchie gangster film Revolver and said the incident on September 3 last year  left him ‘in fear of his life’.

Mr Woodman replied: ‘There was obviously some intention.’ He denied claims he had told the group he did not want to discuss the matter there and suggested going elsewhere. Mr Woodman denied claims he had concocted the case based on the 2005 Guy Ritchie film Revolver. Mr . Missouri said. ‘It is about getting attention.

Families threw away mountains of good food over Christmas amid complaints supermarkets continue to encourage people to buy too much. One in five people threw away or wasted more than 10 per cent of the food they bought over Christmas and New Year, according to a new study. Tonnes of fresh vegetables and salad, mince pies and turkey were piled into bins after they went off before they could be eaten. A new study has found that one in five people wasted more than 10 per cent of the food they bought over the festive period . Families blamed supermarket promotions for over-indulging on food purchases they could not eat. Some 70 per cent said supermarkets urged them to increase their food purchasing over the festive season – with 45 per cent saying they did buy more. Seventy-two per cent of shoppers said they were tempted by Buy-One-Get-One-Free Offers(BOGOFS), while 70 per cent said they bought extra because of half-price deals. More than a third named discounts such as vouchers, money off single items and loyalty card offers as other routes to increased and often unnecessary buying. The study was commissioned by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and comes one year after it published a major study -  Global Food; Waste Not, Want Not – estimating that between 30 to 50per cent of all food produced is never eaten. Dr Tim Fox, Head of Energy and Environment at the Institution, said: ‘This latest survey shows that UK shoppers still feel they are encouraged to buy too much food, despite significant progress on raising awareness of food waste in 2013, and some retailer action to reduce over-purchasing. Seventy-two per cent of respondents said they were tempted by Buy One Get One Free deals, while 70 per cent said they had bought extra because of the deals . ‘There are various reasons why around a third to a half of all food produced in the world never reaches a human stomach, and while it would be wrong to lay all of the blame for waste with the supermarkets - deals like Buy-One-Get-One-Free, “half price” offers and various other price discounting methods do exacerbate the problem.’ He said: ‘It is certainly a concern that over a fifth of the people surveyed said they had thrown away more than 10per cent of the food they bought over the festive period. ‘This food could be used to help feed those in hunger today, and is also an unnecessary waste of the considerable land, water and energy resources that were used in the production, processing and distribution of this food - resources that could be used to meet other human needs. ‘If we are to have a sustainable future on a planet with over nine billion people on board it is important that everybody, from the Government and retailers through to consumers at home, tries to reduce the amount of food that is wasted and thinks about the land, water and energy resources involved in bringing food to the plate.’ The survey of 2,023 people found that the older generation threw less food away. Some 45per cent of over 65s said they did not waste or throw away any of the food, which compares to just a third of those aged 18-24. The Institution said the world produces about four billion metric tonnes of food per year, but between a third and a half of this is wasted through poor practices and inadequate infrastructure. The study, Global Good; Waste Not Want Not estimated that between 30 and 50 per cent of all food produced is never eaten. File picture . The group said it would be possible to feed the world’s growing population without the need to increase production greatly, if more of the food that is produced was eaten rather than wasted. Supermarkets have attempted to shift the blame for food waste from themselves to customers. A senior executive at Tesco caused controversy in December by suggesting that fussy customers, who were unwilling to buy misshapen or blemished fresh produce, were to blame. Matt Simister, food sourcing director at Tesco, told a House of Lords inquiry, that customers will also select the freshest and best looking fruit and vegetables. He said: ‘Customers naturally select, they always pick the cream of crop first and the rest of it then gets left. ‘Then the new deliveries come in and you have the new cream of the crop – the old, ugly misshapen produce goes to waste. ‘Customers will always make the choice of the one that cosmetically looks better. That’s a very difficult reality to us.’ In October, Tesco revealed that it generated almost 30,000 tons of food waste in the first six months of the year. It found that up to two thirds of supermarket food ends up in the bin, including 68 per cent of bagged salads, half of bakery goods and a quarter of grapes. Much of the food was thrown away by customers but large amounts were lost because they have been on display for too long. The supermarket subsequently scrapped confusing ‘display until’ dates on fresh fruit and vegetables, and ended buy one get one free offers on salads. Research by the Waste and Resources Action Programme suggests families waste £60 a month by throwing the equivalent of almost a meal a day into the bin. It said a staggering £12.5billion worth of food is wasted annually.","One in five people threw away or wasted more than 10 per cent of the food they bought over Christmas and New Year .

Schirmer is currently serving a life sentence for the murder of his second wife while awaiting trial in the murder of his first wife . New details shed light on how a Pennsylvania pastor nicknamed the 'Sinister Minister' staged a car accident to kill his second wife, as he started dating one of his married congregants. Police in rural Reeders, Pennsylvania started investigating Methodist Pastor A.B. Schirmer, after the October 2008 suicide of congregant Joe Musante, who had recently learned that his wife Cindy was having an affair with the pastor. While the pastor and his married mistress were ruled out as suspects in Musante's death, the suicide put enough attention on Schirmer that police decided to re-investigate the mysterious 'accidental' deaths of his two wives. Schirmer's second wife Betty died in a car accident just three months before Musante's death, and his first wife Jewel died falling down a set of stairs in 1999. Pocono Township Police Detective Jim Wagner believes it was Schirmer's position in the church that kept him from suspicion. 'Who would suspect a minister of doing such, such awful things?' Det Wagner told CBS News. Schirmer has since been charged with murder in both of his wives' deaths. He was convicted of killing Betty, wife number two, last year and is currently serving a life sentence while awaiting trial for the death of his first wife, Jewel. A new CBS News report sheds more light on Betty and Jewel's gruesome deaths and how those close to the victims championed to bring Schirmer to justice. Interest in Schirmer started with Musante's suicide in October 2008.

The church: Schirmer was pastor at Reeders Methodist Church where Joe Mustante was found after committing suicide . Joe Musante has struggled with alcoholism his whole life and finally decided to turn to the church for solace. As a carpenter, he helped with repairs and jobs around the Reeders Methodist Church where Cindy, his wife of 18 years, worked and where Schirmer was pastor. It was Musante's daughter Samantha who discovered the affair between her mother and their pastor after reading inappropriate text messages on her mother's phone. 'There was no doubt. It wasn't 'I love you in Christ' type of text message,' Ms Musante said. 'Not something that you'd expect your employer to be sending you. She confronted Schirmer about the affair in an anonymous email, but somehow the pastor and her mother were able to trace the email back to her . Caught: Samantha Musante discovered the affair between her mother and the pastor by reading inappropriate text messages between the two . 'They took me into his office and told me that I was wrong, that nothing was going on and how dare I accuse them of an affair,' she said. She believed them at first, but changed her mind when her father asked her if she knew about an affair. 'And . then he said, ""Does she love him?"" And I just said, ""I think so."" That's probably one of the most horrible things that you can hear,' said . Samantha. Musante confronted his wife and made her promise to end the affair, but . soon learned she was making secret phone calls to the pastor behind his . back. The . day before he died, Cindy took the kids to stay at her sister's . house and wouldn't let anyone answer her husband's calls. Justice: Rose Cobb pushed police to investigate the death of Schirmer's wives after learning about her brother's suicide . The . next morning Samantha checked her voicemail and found a message from . her father saying 'If you love me at all, please call me back'. That . same morning, Musante was found slumped over in a chair at the . church, having shot himself while sitting behind the pastor's desk he . crafted. Attention . turned to Schirmer as a possible suspect in Musante's death when sister Rose Cobb arrived in town for the memorial service. Ms Cobb found sister-in-law Cindy's . behavior strange, saying she seemed 'giddy' in love with the pastor and . totally unbothered by the deaths of his two wives. . While . Schirmer and Cindy were eventually ruled out as possible murderers in . Ms Musante's death, the suicide triggered investigators to take a second . look into the deaths of Betty and Jewel. Investigators first turned their . attention to Betty's car crash and discovered several inconsistencies in . Schirmer's side of the story. Stan Dickerson discovered the wreck and said Schirmer seemed 'indifferent' to his wife's condition and hadn't even called 911. Schirmer . also gave out different stories about why his wife wasn't wearing her . seat belt, telling some that she had just readjusted to get comfortable . while telling police she never put the seat belt on to begin with. Betty's . grave state also didn't line up with the damage on the car. There . weren't any skid marks on the road, no sign of braking and little damage . to the front end of the car. The airbags hadn't deployed and the car . was functioning to the point that Schirmer could have backed up and . driven his wife to the hospital . Convicted: Schirmer was sentenced to life in prison for the 2008 murder of his wife Betty and will face trial for the death of first-wife Betty . The blood stains in the car didn't make any sense either. Blood stains were found on the passenger seat where Betty was sitting . which wouldn't have happened had she started bleeding in the car. 'If I'm sitting in a car being thrown around there might be blood all around here, but there wouldn't be blood on my seat,' Det Wagner said. 'And the fact that it was absorbed and saturated meant that she was … placed in it,' he added. Detectives got a warrant to search Schirmer's parsonage and that's where they found the evidence that solidified their case . Blood . drops stained the concrete right next to where the passenger door would . open, and tests revealed that the blood belonged to Betty. 'She . was bleeding prior to getting in that car. And she was assaulted and . put in that car and placed in that car seat,' Det Wagner said. Unmoved: Schirmer didn't even call 911 after getting into an 'accidental' car wreck with second-wife Betty . Investigators continued to build up their case against Schirmer, but sped things up when he proposed to Cindy. Samantha . remembers getting the text message from her mom, telling her the news . that he had bought her a ring. The very next thing Samantha did was call . police, afraid for her mother's safety. 'I . was worried for her safety at that point,' she replied. 'She was gonna . be wife number three.  And the first two...didn't have a whole lot of . luck.' The Monroe County Police agreed. In September 2010, just a few weeks after Schirmer's . proposal, he was arrested and charged with Betty's murder. With Schirmer safely in custody, police turned their attention to the pastor's first wife. Jewel, the mother of Schirmer's two daughters, died in 1999 after allegedly falling down a set of stairs in their Lebanon County, Pennsylvania home while vacuuming. Doctors initially pegged Jewel's death to a heart attack, but the autopsy told a different story. Dr Wayne Ross was the medical examiner who conducted the autopsy back then and he says he found it strange that the only injuries Jewel suffered were several skull fractures. If she had actually fallen down the stairs, Dr Ross says she would have had other broken bones below the neck so he classified her cause of death as 'undetermined'. 'Undetermined means it's open...and it certainly could be a homicide,' Dr Ross said. Supporters: Schirmer's daughters Julie and Amy refuse to believe that their father killed their mother and step-mother . At the time, he urged investigators to look more into the death, but they never did since it wasn't considered suspicious. In September 2012, while still in custody for Betty's murder, police had amassed enough evidence to charge Schirmer for Jewel's murder. Schirmer faced trial for Betty's murder last year and the jury found him guilty of murder in the first degree. He was handed a life sentence without the possibility of parole and is currently waiting to stand trial in Jewel's murder. Despite the evidence against him, his daughters Julie and Amy still believe their father is innocent. And so does Cindy, whom Schirmer was never able to marry. Schirmer's daughters say she has become a grandmother-like figure to their children who call her 'Mimi' now. Meanwhile, Cindy no longer has a relationship with her own daughter Samantha who discovered the affair. 'I don't have a relationship with her,' Samantha said. 'I can't really say that she is my mother.  She is not the woman that raised me. … I wish she could see A.B. for who he really is.' Separated: Cindy Musante has become a part of Schirmer's family, despite never getting the change to marry him .","A.B.

Statistics: There are two million Britons either with cancer or in recovery (file picture) The number of Britons diagnosed with cancer annually has soared by almost 50,000 to more than 330,000 in a decade. Experts blame the rise on an ageing population, as well as obesity and alcohol consumption, which can trigger the disease. But the number of cases is placing a growing burden on the NHS, with more patients needing expensive treatment as well as long-term care for side-effects. There are two million Britons either with cancer or in recovery. Some will develop heart conditions, lung problems or other complications as a result of treatment. Figures from Cancer Research UK reveal that 330,000 cases were diagnosed in 2011, up from 283,000 in 2001. This included 50,000 with breast cancer, 40,695 with bowel cancer, 40,975 with prostate cancer, 42,026 with lung cancer and 12,818 with skin cancer. Chief executive Dr Harpal Kumar said: ‘These figures reinforce the vital need for more research to better prevent, treat and cure cancer. ‘One day we will beat cancer. The more research we do, the sooner that day will come.’ The charity says nearly two thirds of cases are diagnosed in the over-65s. But obesity and alcohol are believed to increase the risk of breast and bowel cancers, among others. Thanks to improved treatment and earlier diagnosis, patients now live for six years on average after being diagnosed, compared with just one in the Seventies. But this creates extra problems for the NHS with more patients needing treatment for cancer and re-occurring tumours as well as for the drugs themselves. Side-effects: Some sufferers can develop heart conditions, lung problems or other complications as a result of treatment for the disease . Radiotherapy and chemotherapy can cause lifelong complications including heart problems, lung disease, immobility, depression and bone-thinning. Mike Hobday, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘We are concerned that the NHS will simply not be able to cope with this surge in demand. ‘There needs to be a fundamental shift towards proper aftercare, with more delivered in the community.’ The charity estimates that by 2030, four million Britons will have cancer or be in remission.","Ageing population has also been blamed for the growing numbers .

A Los Angeles judge has rejected a bid by Michael Jackson's mother Katherine Jackson to secure a new trial in the wrongful death lawsuit against AEG Live, the late Michael Jackson's concert promoter. A jury already found AEG Live not liable for over $1 billion in damages in October after a five-month trial. The Jackson matriach had filed documents in early December asking for another chance to convince a jury that the company should be found liable, claiming a number of mistakes were made during the original trial. Upheld: Superior Court Judge Yvette M. Palazuelos gathers the verdict documents moments before they are publicly disclosed in the Jackson V. AEG Live civil trial for the death of Michael Jackson October 2, 2013 . Time to move on: Lawyers for AEG Live are claiming Katherine Jackson's request for a new wrongful death trial is fundamentally flawed . Although Monday's ruling was not in her favor, Jackson isn't giving up. She intends to take her case to the California Court of Appeal and according to TMZ has already filed legal documents with the court. Concert promoter AEG Live urged . Katherine Jackson to move on after losing their legal tussle over the . death of her pop superstar son Michael as she prepared to file documents in December. According to TMZ, lawyers for the firm argued the bid was a desperate last ditch effort and that jury instructions at the original hearing were fair and taken directly from the California Civil Jury instruction guide book. Still grieving: Prince Jackson and Katherine Jackson arrive at the world premiere of 'Michael Jackson ONE by Cirque du Soleil' at THEhotel at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, Nevada . 'We couldn't be more pleased with the court's ruling,' AEG's lead lawyer Marvin Putnam said Monday, reports the New York Daily News. 'We were confident that the court would uphold the jury's verdict, the product of five months of their careful focus and attention,' he said. A Los Angeles jury in October cleared AEG Live of negligence in the singer's 2009 death following a lengthy trial. Katherine had accused the concert promoters of being negligent for hiring her son's personal physician, Dr. Conrad Murray. Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for giving the King of Pop a fatal overdose of the anesthetic propofol in 2009. Close family: Michael Jackson and his mother are shown in May 2005 at the singer's child molestation trial in Santa Maria, California . The jury found that AEG Live, while promoting the singer's This Is It comeback concert, was not liable for Murray's actions. They found that Murray was neither 'unfit' nor 'incompetent' when he was hired by AEG. Jackson children: Michael's children Prince, Paris and Blanket, shown in 2012 in Los Angeles, stand to gain millions of dollars if AEG Live is found responsible . The family claimed there were numerous reasons to grant another trial, including: jury misconduct, new evidence and general procedural errors. In her first trial, Katherine was seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages for herself and her late son's three children, Prince, Paris and Blanket. Murray was released from jail in October after he served less than two years of a four-year sentence for involuntary manslaughter.

The son of Neil Kinnock plans to stand for Parliament as a Labour MP, it emerged yesterday. Stephen Kinnock, 44, becomes the last member of his family to enter politics after being shortlisted for Aberavon. The father of two is married to Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt – who took the notorious ‘selfie’ with David Cameron and Barack Obama at Nelson Mandela’s memorial service. Unusual: Stephen Kinnock hopes to stand for election in the UK, while his wife Helle Thorning-Schmidt is still Prime Minister of Denmark, something she has as admitted is 'unusual' Dynasty: Mr Kinnock hopes to follow in the footsteps of his father Neil, who led Labour from 1983 to 1994. Pictured in 1992 are (left to right) Stephen Kinnock, his mother Glenys, sister Rachel and father Neil . In what she has admitted is an . ‘unusual’ move, the couple plan to pursue separate political careers in . their home countries. Mr Kinnock, who has been based in London since . 2012, faced controversy in Denmark – where he was embroiled in a tax . scandal and the couple were forced to deny ‘grotesque’ rumours that he . was gay. Speaking of his . decision to enter British politics, Mr Kinnock told BBC Radio Wales: ‘I . have been a member of the Labour party since I was 15 years old, and of . course politics is in my blood. ‘But it was always important for me to build my own career before making the decision to stand.’ Mr . Kinnock’s father Neil was Labour leader between 1983 and 1992 before . becoming a European Commissioner. His mother Glenys was a Labour MEP . before she took a life peerage and a job as Europe Minister under Gordon . Brown. Both now sit in the Lords. Sister . Rachel was a research assistant for her mother in Brussels before . serving Gordon Brown and is now a member of Ed Miliband’s inner circle. Mr . Kinnock, who works for business advisory company Xyntéo, is now hoping . to take a Welsh seat that Labour has held since 1922 as one of Labour’s . ‘Red Princes’. He joins a list of other politicians’ sons hoping to . become MPs, with Jack Straw’s son Will already securing a seat and David . Prescott and Euan Blair both on the lookout. Tory . MP Philip Davies last night mocked the way Labour officials have . cleared the way for Stephen Kinnock, adding: ‘I just hope that he’s not . as much of a windbag as his father.’ Labour has agreed that Aberavon should be one of two seats where men are allowed on the candidate shortlist in Wales. He must now make his pitch to the constituency in the hope of being selected to stand in the 2015 general election. Labour has a majority of ore than 11,000 in the seat, vacated by Hywel Francis who is standing down. While Mr Kinnock hopes to enter the Commons in 2015, his wife Helle Thorning-Schmidt is not planning to quit as Danish PM. Smiles: Miss Thorning Schmid made headlines around the world last month after poising for a selfie with British PM David Cameron and US President Barack Obama . If Stephen Kinnock makes it to the Commons he will join a growing list Labour figures following in the footsteps of family members who defined the party for a generation. Will Straw, son of former Home Secretary Jack, has been selected to contest the seat of Rossendale and Darwen in Lancashire. David Prescott, son of former Deputy Prime Minister John, missed out on becoming the candidate for the seat of Greenwich but was has not given up hope of finding a berth. Euan Blair, son of former PM Tony, reportedly has his eye on finding a seat, but after being linked with Coventry North West, incumbent Geoffrey Robinson was reselected. Jo Dromey, son of Labour MPs Harriet Harman and Jack Dromey, has denied being on the look out for a seat but many in the party expect him to stand. Emily Benn, granddaughter of Tony and niece of Hillary, stood in the 2010 general election anbd could do so again. She made headlines around the world last month when she was seen posing for a selfie with David Cameron and US President Barack Obama during Nelson Mandela’s memorial service in South Africa. She has admitted the plan for her husband to seek election 700 miles from her home in Copenhagen is ‘unusual’. She told journalists last month: ‘We have lived an unusual life in many ways and we always make it work. I’m absolutely convinced we will make this work as well. ‘So to all of you who are worried about the way we will make it work in our private household, don’t worry too much.’ The couple have two daughters. She was elected as Prime Minister in 2011 and a year later Mr Kinnock moved to base himself in London. After leaving university in 1992 – the year his father lost the crunch election to John Major’s beleaguered Tory party – Mr Kinnock worked in Brussels, Russia, Africa and Switzerland. In the run-up to a Danish general election a scandal erupted over claims Mr Kinnock was paying tax in Switzerland and not Denmark. He was cleared by an official report later but he did not meet residency rules because he spent so long out of the country. The couple later gave an interview denying rumours he was gay with Miss Thorning-Schmidt saying the claims were ‘grotesque’.","Stephen Kinnock shortlisted for the safe Labour seat of Aberavon .

She faces prosecution if she returns to the States and has expressed her fear that she may never live with her husband and two daughters - who remain in New York - as family again.

She also told of the hopes with which she had arrived in the country in the first place. ‘When I decided to come to the United States my hope was to work . for a few years to support my family and then return to India,' said Richard. ‘I . never thought that things would get so bad here, that I would work so . much that I did not have time to sleep or eat or have time to myself. ‘Because of this treatment, I requested that I return to India but that request was denied.’ She went on: ‘I would like to express my appreciation to everyone who has supported me through this process.’ In the dock: An artist's sketch of Devyani Khobragade at her arraignment in Manhattan Federal Court in December .

Director of the Anti-Trafficking Program at Safe Horizon applauded the . steps taken by the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New . York for indicting Khobragade on charges of visa fraud and making . false statements in connection with Richard. She welcomed the move as a demonstration of how seriously the U.S. government treats labor exploitation. She . said: ‘I hope this case sends a clear message to diplomats and consular . officials that the U.S. will not tolerate the exploitation of workers and . marks the beginning of an increase in prosecution of these cases.’ According to Safe Horizon, Richard's is not an isolated case but one that is ‘tragically common.’ Devyani Khobragade was accused of fraudulently obtaining a work visa for her New York City housekeeper. The . grand jury indictment said Khobragade had made multiple false representations . to U.S. authorities, or caused them to be made, to obtain a visa for a . personal domestic worker. She planned to bring the worker to the . United States in September 2012 when she worked at the Consulate General . of India in New York, according to the indictment. But in a letter to the judge, prosecutors said there was no need for an . arraignment because Khobragade had 'very recently' been given diplomatic . immunity status and left the United States on Thursday. The . letter said the charges will remain pending until she can be brought to . court to face them, either through a waiver of immunity or her return . to the U.S. without immunity status. 'We . will alert the court promptly if we learn that the defendant returns to . the United States in a non-immune capacity, at which time the . government will proceed to prosecute this case and prove the charges in . the indictment,' the letter from the office of U.S. Attorney Preet . Bharara said. A group supporting domestic workers' rights demonstrate across the street from the Indian Consulate General on December 20 in New York . Khobragade has maintained her . innocence to the accusations that she claimed to pay her Indian maid $4,500 . per month but actually gave her far less than the U.S. minimum wage. Her . arrest last month sparked outrage in India after revelations that she . was strip-searched and thrown in a cell with other criminal defendants . before being released on $250,000 bail. In an . unusual statement last month, U.S. Attorney Bharara responded to . what he described as misinformation and factual inaccuracy in the case . by saying Khobragade was accused of creating false documents and lying . to the U.S. government about what she was doing, including hiring a . housekeeper who was working far more than the 40 hours per week she was . contracted to work. He also . questioned why there was ‘precious little outrage’ about the treatment . of the Indian housekeeper and her husband while there was so much about . the alleged treatment of Khobragade. He . said his office's sole motivation was to uphold the law, protect . victims and hold lawbreakers accountable, ‘no matter what their societal . status and no matter how powerful, rich or connected they are'. These . developments came as it was revealed that a lawsuit filed months ago on . behalf of the housekeeper alleged poor working conditions. Philip Richard, Ms Richard's husband, filed a petition at the High Court in New Delhi in . July saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day. Mr Richard also said the consular . official's father Uttam Khobragade had threatened Mrs Richard's family . saying that he would have them abducted and framed on false drug . charges. In the petition, first seen by Outlookindia.com, . a concerned Mr Richard wrote: 'The treatment of Sangeeta by Devyani . Khobragade is tantamount to keeping a person in slavery-like conditions . or keeping a person in bondage.' The . petition also stated: 'Uttam Khobragade called Sangeeta's family . several times and threatened them that they would have to face dire . consequences if she complains and that he would ruin their future, get . them abducted and frame false charges of drugs against them.' Mr . Richard also wrote that Khobragade had accused his wife of stealing in . front of a U.S. immigration officer but would not provide details of . what the woman took. Mrs Richard's daughter Jennifer also . wrote a letter to U.S. officials saying that her mother was unhappy and . wanted to return to India but the diplomat refused to let her go.

The mastermind of the September 11 terrorist attacks has penned a 36-page manifesto in an effort to convert his lawyers and the judge in the ‘kangaroo court’ to Islam. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed uses quotes from former presidents George W. Bush and Richard Nixon as argument points in his push against America, ‘the so-called ""War on Terror""’ and Christianity. The manifesto, obtained by The Huffington Post, was the first of three planned parts that the al Qaeda leader has written from inside the most secure portion of Guantanamo Bay where he and other high-value detainees are held. His new mission: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (right) wrote the first of a three-part manifesto wherein he describes his desire to convert all of the non-Muslims in the trial process- including his lawyer and judge- to Islam . Mohammed’s statement marks a dramatic change from his earlier statements, as he previously defended the right to use violence in order to spread the word of Islam. Instead, the document attempts to make a more rationalized and philosophical argument. ‘It is my religious duty in dealing with any non-Muslim such as the people in court (the Judge, the prosecution, attorneys, etc.) to invite them to embrace Islam… it is my own belief that Allah will ask me on the Day of Judgment why I did not invite these people to Islam?’ he writes. ‘American crusader soldier men and women . join the U.S. army, wear the latest military gear, eat the best food in . Iraq and Afghanistan, and play with their play stations... but at the end, the American soldiers’ -writes Khalid Sheikh Mohammed . ‘Do not believe those who claim that the Mujahedeen fight infidels to turn them to Islam or that we are fighting you because you practice democracy, freedom, or claim that you uphold human rights. Islam prohibits us to force our religion on any human being but encourages us to invite them with wisdom and fair preaching and to persuade them in the best way.’ The document is written in English as the terrorist attended college in North Carolina and has a strong understanding of the language. He regularly refers to the collective group of those fighting- many times violently- for Islam as the Muhajedeen. ‘I wanted to write these papers in three parts. I had written most of the first part before they took away our laptops that contain the evidence, at the end of 2009. I will later work on to complete the remaining two parts after the government returns our computers soon,’ he wrote. He teases that the two yet-unwritten chapters will include his justifications for the September 11th terrorist attacks, as well as his views on the ensuing war on terror. Ongonig: Mohammed was captured in 2003 and he has declared himself to be the mastermind behind the September 11 terrorist attacks that left nearly 3,000 dead- but now he has renounced violence as a means of conversion . ‘The second part deals with why the Mujahedeen carried out 9/11 and whether it was a terrorist operation or an act of self-defense sanctioned by every constitution and international laws as the right of everyone whose land is occupied and whose people are attacked,’ he wrote. The third portion poses a number of questions about the wars that followed which will surely become fodder for conspiracy theorists, as he asks ‘Were they fought to defend freedom and human rights? Women's rights? Or were they fought for the benefits and interests of individuals and corporations?’ While the first few pages focus largely on the sunny interpretation of himself as a messenger of Allah, the manifest spins into a diatribe against Western social ills, slamming the Catholic church, same sex relationships, and greed. One of the most pointed critiques comes when he uses the high rate of suicide among returning American veterans as a mark against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as American might. ‘American crusader soldier men and women join the U.S. army, wear the latest military gear, eat the best food in Iraq and Afghanistan, and play with their play stations while their enemies, the poor Muslim can’t find their daily bread or jacket to protect themselves from the harsh snowstorms over Afghanistan mountains, but at the end, the American soldiers go home and commit suicide but the poor man still with his dry bread and black tea lives with his poor wife in their humble muddy house but with happy hearts and souls,’ he wrote. The legal fight against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who is commonly referred to as KSM, formally began in February 2008 when he was charged with organizing the September 11 attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people. The trial has been plagued by controversies, starting with whether it would be held in a military or civilian court and more recently with the decision to allow Mohammed and his other defendants from wearing soldier’s fatigues in the courtroom. On his current state of happiness: . With my current condition, I live in solitary confinement, but I am very happy in my cell because my spirit is free even while my body is being held captive . Happiness is not found only in money, in hearing music, in dancing, or in living a so-called ""free life."" Eve if you were a rich man or woman, you would need to follow the real path of happiness as it has been established in the humans' catalog and manual, ""The Holy Qu'ran"". On his call to convert non-Muslims: . It is my religious duty in dealing with any non-Muslims such as the people in the court (the Judge, the prosecution, attorneys, etc.) to invite them to embrace Islam. I realize very well that you have heard about Islam and know much about it. But it is my own belief that Allah will ask me on the Day of Judgment why I did not invite these people to Islam? On same sex relationships and sexual activities: . If God said no adultery or no sexual contact without a marriage contract between man and woman, the Westerner's God says men and women are free to do whatever they want to do. A mother can even lie with her son and they can issue a marriage certificate for them if the majority in Congress or Parliament agrees to such a thing. Or a man can marry a man or a woman can marry a woman, but by God's laws, these acts are considered social crimes and it will cause unhappiness in their life, it breaks their families and at the end it will break the whole society. On Western moral bankruptcy: . Their communities have been destroyed by the high rates of divorce, rape, robbery, killing, suicide, AIDS, and often depression, bankruptcies, abortion, drugs, homosexuals, homelessness, psychological disorders, mental illnesses and most of the U.S. prisons are over capacity and crime is everywhere among all races and states' On American military suicide rates: . (H)undreds of American crusader soldier men and women join the U.S. army, wear the latest military gear, eat the best food in Iraq and Afghanistan, and play with their play stations while their enemies, the poor Muslim can’t find their daily bread or jacket to protect themselves from the harsh snowstorms over Afghanistan mountains, but at the end, the American soldiers go home and commit suicide but the poor man still with his dry bread and black tea lives with his poor wife in their humble muddy house but with happy hearts and souls. On his process of writing the manifesto: . I wanted to write these papers in three parts. I had written most of the first part before they took away our laptops that contain the evidence, at the end of 2009. I will later work on to complete the remaining to parts after the government returns our computers soon as it has promised: . The first part is an invitation to happiness, to everyone the crusader government has provided to administer this kangaroo trial in Guantanamo: The judge, the prosecution, the lawyers and anyone who works with those groups. The second part deals with why the Mujahedeen carried out 9/11 and whether it was a terrorist operation or an act of self-defense sanctioned by every constitution and international laws as the right of everyone whose land is occupied and whose people are attacked. The third part is the truth about the so-called ""War on Terror"". For whose benefits or interests were these wars fought? Did these wars take place to defend the American people and their interests? Were they fought to defend freedom and human rights? Women's rights? Or were they fought for the benefits and interests of individuals and corporations? Who are those individuals and corporations? What are their interests and benefits? Isn't it true that they work for the weapons industry lobbies, security contractors or Halliburton sister companies etc.?","Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was the self-proclaimed mastermind who planned the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks .

The Democratic lawmaker leading a new 'super committee' into Chris Christie and Bridgegate today said he will turn the screw on other aides he suspects were involved in the affair or the cover-up. 'The investigation will be broader than it started,' General Assembly Deputy Speaker John Wisniewski told MailOnline during an interview at the state capitol in Trenton, just minutes before the governor delivered his annual State of the State address. 'It is going to continue' added Vincent Prieto, the assembly's newly minted speaker said after the speech. 'Public safety and abuse of power are our number one issues.' Scroll down for video . Police escort: Chris Christie delivers his State of the State address today as the Bridgegate scandal threatens to undermine his potential run at the White House . Feeling the heat: Christie's former chief of staff, Kevin O'Dowd, left, will be dragged into the investigation, General Assembly Deputy Speaker John Wisniewski, right with incoming Democratic Vincent Prieto, the New Jersey assembly's newly minted speaker . Wisniewski, who also chairs the transportation committee that has been looking into the so-called 'Bridgegate' scandal, received a warm handshake from the governor as he entered the dramatically appointed state assembly chamber. But the Democratic lawmaker said he doesn't believe Christie's claim that he was in the dark when his aides closed off lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge as payback to a Democratic mayor who refused to endorse his re-election bid. Christie led off his annual speech by promising to cooperate with investigators. 'Without a doubt we will cooperate with all appropriate inquiries to ensure this breach of trust does not happen again,' he said. He fired one of his top aides, then-Deputy Chief of Staff Bridget Kelly, last week. Wisniewski said he thinks it's likely Christie's former chief of staff Kevin O'Dowd – Kelly’s boss – knew as much about the shenanigans as she did. Pressure's on: Christie today said he would fully co-operate with investigators during his State of the State address . Asked if O'Dowd might have been in the dark, Wisniewski replied, 'It's hard to imagine – you know, in any organization, you've got somebody who reports to you and they've done something improper, it's hard to believe.' But 'we don't know yes or no.' O'Dowd is Christie's current pick to be the next New Jersey attorney general, but the controversy has delayed his confirmation hearing because of the possibility that Wisniewski's new committee could subpoena him. The transportation committee issued subpoenas of other officials last year, gathering thousands of pages of emails and text messages. Among them were messages appearing to show Bridget Kelly, the governor's then-deputy chief of staff, conspiring with a Port Authority official to slow traffic in the town of Fort Lee. Emails produced by subpoenas, Wisniewski said, showed that 'the governor has shown a remarkable lack of curiosity in his questioning of his staff, and in his termination of Bridget Kelly.' Suspicious: Wisniewski said he was puzzled about how Christie could fire Bridget Kelly without knowing what she had done . He called it 'suspicious' that Christie would fire her without a debriefing about her role in the scheme. 'This man, as U.S. Attorney, did investigations before breakfast,' the long-time lawmaker quipped. Christie 'was so incensed that he fires her,' he asked, 'and his curiosity escapes him because he doesn't sit down with her, or have somebody sit down with him, and say, ""Bridget, who told you to do this?""' 'We know that there was improper, potentially illegal behavior by a member of the governor's staff,' he said, referring to Kelly. 'We know that there are people in the governor's office that knew about it, and – to take the governor at his word – just filed it away and never said a word?' Christie appeared relaxed during his speech, but acknowledged that 'the last week has certainly tested this administration.' 'Mistakes were clearly made. And as a result, we let down the people we are entrusted to serve.' 'I . know our citizens deserve better. Much better,' he said. ‘I am the . governor and I am ultimately responsible for all that happens on my . watch – both good and bad.' Wisniewski . promised that new subpoenas would be issued 'either Thursday or . Friday,' covering both Kelly and Bill Stepien, a Christie political . confidant who the governor said last week approached the wrongdoing with . a grain of salt, putting his judgment into question. Earlier subpoenas, he said, will be 'grandfathered in' and still in force. Man of the moment: Wisniewski said subpoenas will be issued late r this week to more of Christie's staff . The bridge scandal has produced more questions than answers so far, including uncertainty about Gov. Christie's political future. While details of what his staffers and appointees were up to didn't emerge until after he was re-elected in November, the bridge lane closures first attracted widespread media attention in September. Speculation has run rampant about why New Jersey Democratic pols – including failed gubernatorial candidate Barbara Buono – didn't press the issue harder before the 2013 election. But however the political decision was made, Wisniewski insisted, it was at the state level, and not influenced by national politicos invested in the 2016 presidential race. Asked if Hillary Clinton's camp, or those of Republican senators Ted Cruz or Rand Paul, have been pressing him behind the scenes, he offered an unequivocal denial. 'I haven't talked to anyone like that,' he said. 'Nope.'","General Assembly Deputy Speaker John Wisniewski said he finds it hard to believe that Christie's former chief of staff Kevin O'Dowd wasn't aware of Bridgegate .

'The last week has certainly tested this Administration,' he admitted to a joint session of New Jersey's General Assembly and Senate. 'Mistakes were clearly made.

Head of state: Christie said today that 'I am the governor and I am ultimately responsible for all that happens on my watch - both good and bad' The law breathing down his neck: the Bridgegate scandal is lapping at the Governor's door with possible criminal prosecutions ahead . Moving on... Christie devoted just a minute of the 45-minute speech, at the Statehouse in Trenton, to the scandal before going on to crow about his achievements in New Jersey . 'Without a doubt we will cooperate with all appropriate inquiries to ensure this breach of trust does not happen again. 'But I also want to assure the people of New Jersey today that what has occurred does not define us or our state. ... I am the leader of this state and its people and I stand here today proud to be both. And always determined to do better.' Still, Christie only spent a minute addressing what has been his latest claim to infamy. The text comprised less than a quarter-page of the seven-page speech. The balance of his presentation touted his successes – including a falling unemployment rate, pension reform and his refusal to raise taxes. But Christie's pats on his own back only go so far with observers. Democratic lobbyists milling around the New Jersey state capitol building were predicting a tough day or, as one put it, 'a bridge to nowhere' for Christie. Chrstie then moved on to focus on his successes as a governor. But the lobbyist said 'the whole day will be about [the bridge] anyway.' The sudden closure of three bridge on-ramp lanes backed up traffic throughout the New Jersey town of Fort Lee for four days in September, trapping children in school buses and angering commuters whose trip into New York City was lengthened by an hour or more. 'We let you down': Christie again said he was sorry for denting public trust but said 'what has occurred will not define us' Former Deputy Chief of Staff Bridget Kelly (L) and former Campaign Manager Bill Stepien (R, looking at Christie) were . shown the door on Wednesday and will likely see subpoenas this week. Democrats in Trenton believe a third aide may well soon be dragged into . the crisis . Christie, the famously in-your-face Republican chief executive has already cleaned house, firing a deputy chief of staff and dismissing a long-time political aide who ran his 2013 re-election campaign. But a second Democratic staffer walking the Trenton capitol's halls told MailOnline that the scandal will reach even higher in the Christie administration, and that Kevin O'Dowd, the governor's chief of staff while the bridge scheme was in place, could find himself behind the eight-ball next. 'There's just no way his chief of staff didn't know this was going on,' the political veteran said. 'Christie runs his office like he ran his U.S. Attorney's office. And it's always ""Do as I say, not as I do.""' 'Christie has his entire senior staff in his office for a meeting once a week,' he explained. 'He gathers his staff, he gives marching orders, and when the meeting's over every in the room knows everything that's going on.' 'You're telling me this never came up? No way.' Even . if O'Dowd was unaware, sources tell MailOnline, he faces a rocky road . ahead since Christie has nominated him to serve as the Garden State's . next attorney general. A . state assembly Senate Democratic aide told MailOnline Tuesday morning . that his confirmation hearing is being delayed because legislators on a . hastily assembled super committee organized to address the bridge . scandal don't know if they will issue a subpoena. If . O'Dowd were attorney general when a subpoena went out, he would be . responsible for enforcing it against himself, and for prosecuting . himself if he refused. The result could create a constitutional crisis . in the state. 'It's open season,' an aide in the capitol confided. David Wildstein refused to testify before Assemblyman John Wisniewski's transportation committee on Jan. 9, citing his Fifth Amendment rights, but assembly democrats voted to hold him in contempt -- and now Wisniewski has asked a prosecutor to charge him with a crime . John . Wisniewski, the liberal state assemblyman leading the charge against . New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie in the wake of his George Washington . Bridge traffic scandal, announced Monday that he has formed a new . special investigative committee to issue subpoenas and press for more . answers. A Rasmussen poll of . New Jerseyans released Monday found that 54 per cent believe it's . 'likely' that Christie knew about the plot to close the bridge lanes . when it happened. Only 17 per cent said it was 'not at all likely.' In . the meantime, acting Attorney General John Hoffman remains in place, . perhaps permanently. Regina Egea, a Christie aide responsible for . overseeing the state 'authorities unit,' recently moved up to the chief . of staff role, she has been promised. Among . the government agencies Egea's long-time department manages is the Port . Authority, which saw two of its officials resign in December after they . were implicated in the bridge matter. Egea . was also the first Christie staffer to receive an email about the chaos . the September lane closures created, and was warned that the result . could be dangerous to the public. Bridget Kelly and David Wildstein kicked off the traffic shenanigans with a gleeful internal email on August 13, subpoenaed documents show . Subpoenaed records released by state assembly Democrats on Friday show that Bill Baroni, the Port Authority's then-deputy director and a Christie appointee, forwarded a message to Egea just hours after three lanes on the bridge were closed off to local traffic, saying that the move created 'dangers to the public interest.' A contrite Christie apologized for the scandal Thursday in a marathon press conference, but maintained that he had no knowledge of the scheme that had already brought the December resignations of Baroni and David Wildstein, the Port Authority official who supervised what he would later call a 'traffic study.' The governor claimed during Thursday's press event that he had no relationship with Wildstein and could not recall having conversations with him. 'I have had no contact with David Wildstein in a long time, a long time, well before the election,' Christie said. 'You know, I could probably count on one hand the number of conversations I’ve had with David since he worked at the Port Authority. I did not interact with David.' On Tuesday The Wall Street Journal published photographs of the two chatting during the Sept. 11 memorial ceremonies – on the third day of the bridge lane closures. It's not known what they discussed. The governor's presumed aspirations to be the next President of the United States are in jeopardy as the scandal has energized New Jersey Democrats who are determined to torpedo their governor. 'It's open season,' an aide in the capitol confided.

The ideals of female beauty and desirability, for both men and women across the UK, don’t fall far from the images portrayed in glossy magazines and celebrity pin-up calendars, if the latest research is anything to go by. A new study has looked into what makes a member of the opposite sex 'desirable' and despite the average women weighing around 11st 2lbs and wearing a size 16, 94 per cent of all respondents - both male and female - said that weighing 10 stone or more and wearing above a size 14 was  'undesirable' and 'unattractive'. And it seems that women are taking note; the study also found that 10 stone is the tipping point for most to try various diet and exercise regimes. Most desired: The nation has voted and Davina McCall and the Duchess of Cambridge have been voted as having the most desired celebrity bodies . The survey discovered that the celebrities with the most desirable bodies were Davina McCall, the Duchess of Cambridge and Holly Willoughby. When it came to their own physiques, the majority of men (75 per cent), said that a waist measurement of 36inch or more was the sign it time to go on a diet. With the average man's waist measuring 35.8in, the research suggests that those polled believe it is more acceptable for men to be on the larger side than it is for women. The survey found that when it comes to our men, the top five most desirable features are toned arms, broad shoulders, masculine features, a pert bottom and non-receding hairline. Buff bods: Hugh Jackman (L) and David Beckham were voted as having the most desirable male bodies . The least desirable features were, surprisingly, a six-pack, as well as skinny legs and a small frame. The nation voted Hugh Jackman, David Beckham and Gerard Butler as having the most desirable male bodies. The survey also uncovered, that while many of those surveyed (46 per cent) will be dieting as part of their New Year’s resolutions, the majority of people will not be partaking in ‘Dry January’ and giving up alcohol. Weighing in: The study also found that weighing over 10 stone is perceived as undesirable and the tipping point for most females to try various diet and exercise regimes . Chocolate was another item which just under a quarter of those surveyed admitted to not being able to give up. A spokesperson for Diet Chef, who commisioned the survey, said: This survey has produced quite interesting results; it’s disturbing to see that the ideal body weight and size for women is so small, especially given our average dress size (size 16), and that it's more acceptable for men to be on the larger side than it is for women. 'Rather than concentrating on an ideal size, people, and women in particular, need to be thinking ""what’s healthy for me, and how do I achieve a healthy BMI and weight"". Not, ""how do I look like an airbrushed model"". The images of girls in magazines are not realistic; everybody has been airbrushed to look like perfection.' Speaking about the survey results, Body Image and Wellbeing Expert Katie Lowe of fatgirlphd.com said: 'I'm not in the least bit surprised by the results - it shows once again that when it comes to our ideas around women's health, the emphasis seems to be firmly on the scales, rather than more accurate measurements of physical wellbeing. 'It's interesting that men measure themselves by inches, whereas women use the scales - because measurements are a much more accurate gauge of progress and health on any given weight loss programme, and tend to vary considerably less. 'The reason we place such an emphasis on the scales is due to an overreliance on BMI as a gauge of health - when in reality, it should form only one dimension of an assessment of the physical wellbeing of an individual. Measuring up: For the majority of men (75 per cent), being a 36inch waist or more was their diet trigger, suggesting that it is far more acceptable for men to be on the larger side than it is for women . 'It's entirely possible to be unhealthy at 10 stone as it is to be at peak fitness when considerably heavier - it all depends on ratios of muscle, fat and bone, as well as cardiovascular health, and so on. 'From a body image perspective, the number on the scales needs to be just one measurement of our health, and certainly not one of our self-worth - and our ideas of what constitutes a healthy weight need to be more realistic, especially given the average size of women in the UK. 'We can do this in two ways - first, by challenging ideas of what constitutes a healthy weight; and secondly, by moving our body image and self-worth away from that number between our toes.'","94% said that weighing more than 10st was undesirable and unattractive .

It was hardly the reunion William Reid had imagined when he waved his daughter Melissa off to Ibiza seven weeks earlier. In a police station in distant Peru, he tries to comfort his distraught child, stroking her hair and kissing her head as she sobs into his chest. She cannot hug him back because her hands are cuffed. When he sees the chains around her wrists, he breaks down too. Scroll down for video . William Reid hugs his daughter Melissa as he reunites with her in Diandro police station . This is the first time Mr Reid has seen his daughter since she and Michaella McCollum Connolly, 20, were arrested for allegedly trying to smuggle £1.5million worth of cocaine out of Peru. Police officers believe they were knowingly involved in smuggling, which carries a maximum sentence of 25 years in jail. The women claim Colombian gangsters forced them to act as drug mules. Exhausted from travel, Mr Reid confesses it takes him a few seconds to realise it is his child rushing towards him. Her face is thin, there are deep bags under her eyes and she is almost unrecognisable from the happy, tanned teenager he saw in the photographs of her holiday she posted on Facebook. Today Melissa turns 20, but there will be no celebrations at Lima’s maximum security Dirandro police station, where Mr Reid, 54, was allowed only 15 minutes with his daughter on Wednesday night. He says he is living his worst nightmare, and can scarcely believe what is happening. While he flew out to Lima, his wife Debra, 53, a National Grid administrator, remained at their home in Lenzie, Glasgow, to look after their other children Liam, 22, and twins Stephanie and Jennifer, 18. The pictures capture the first time Mr Reid has seen his daughter since she and Michaella McCollum Connolly, 20, were arrested for allegedly trying to smuggle £1.5million worth of cocaine out of Peru . Still holding the Ugg boots he brought her from home, the father hugs his daughter - who cannot embrace him back because her hands were tied . Seven weeks earlier, he dropped off his ‘bubbly, intelligent’ daughter at Glasgow airport for her flight to the Spanish party island of Ibiza, where she planned to work in bars and clubs for a season. Mr Reid, a manager for a gas company, told her to ‘have fun but be careful’. On August 6, Melissa and Michaella were caught at Lima airport with nearly six kilos of cocaine hidden in their suitcases as they waited to board a flight to Madrid. Melissa claims Colombian gangsters took her from Ibiza to Palma in Majorca, and then Madrid. At least one gang member escorted her on each flight. Physically shaking, Melissa tells her father: ‘They made me do it.’ But as he breaks down, she tells him soothingly ‘I know Dad’ and reaches for his hand. She talks quickly as she tells him how one of her new female friends in Ibiza had introduced her to a charming British man who gave his name as Jake. She said he had seemed ‘really nice and friendly’, and he came back to the apartment she shared with a close friend from home, 20-year-old Rebecca Hughes. There, she claimed, he became aggressive. ‘I felt really scared because I was alone in the flat. He told me I had to come and meet some of his friends and pressured me to get into a taxi.’ Then she was bundled into a flat and confronted by a group of Colombian gangsters, who put a gun to her head. She says: ‘I could feel the metal against my temple. I thought they were going to kill me. They said they knew all about me and my family. I was so scared they were going to hurt them if I didn’t do as I was told. I didn’t know they wanted me to take drugs or money or guns at that point.’ Melissa Reid, 19, and Michaella McCollum Connolly, 20, were found with £1.5million worth of cocaine as they waited for a flight out of the South American country . Melissa says she first met Michaella, from Northern Ireland, in one of the gangsters’ dingy hideaways in Palma. They were kept captive in a flat, she said, then flown to Lima separately. Officers suspect they were recruited by a cartel allegedly operated from behind bars by Philip Austin Collins, the nephew of singer Phil Collins. The 38-year-old was arrested in Peru last year after £3million worth of cocaine was found on a yacht he and two other British men were trying to sail across the Atlantic. During the first visit, Melissa tells her father: ‘I wanted to tell the air hostesses or anyone in the airports, but the men said they would know if we had spoken to anyone, that they were watching all the time. ‘It was a choice between doing what I was told and getting it over and done with and hopefully getting back to Spain or trying to escape and being killed.’ The two women are in separate concrete cells, but are able to communicate when they visit the shared bathroom. Melissa says she is ‘freezing’ at night, but that staff are treating them well. The women are trying to help the police to find the mystery Briton, who is believed to work finding ‘drugs girls’ in Ibiza. She tells her father that they expect to be questioned formally by police for the first time within the next 24 hours. Melissa also says she fears evidence has already been contaminated, claiming police officers did not wear gloves as they handled the food bags in which the drugs are said to have been stored. As she talks to her father about her fears, a detective tells her that she must return to her cell. Mr Reid quickly gives her a few comforts he and his wife chose from her bedroom at home – a navy blue spotted onesie from Next, a pink fleece and her grey Ugg Boots. She puts them on immediately. Coerced: Melissa Reid, left, and Michaella . McCollum Connolly, right, say they were forced into carrying drugs by a . violent gang who threatened their families . The father and daughter look anguished as she stands up to leave and Mr Reid whispers in her ear: ‘We will do everything we can to get you out of here. We will work something out.’ As they separate, armed guards lead Melissa down to her cell and she shouts to her father, ‘I need to learn Spanish’. As the metal doors leading to the prison shut, she shouts: ‘I love you dad’. Mr Reid was able to return to visit his daughter and Michaella last night. They described how they tried to escape in Palma, when they saw the door to the flat was ajar. Michaella said: ‘We looked at each other and said “let’s run away and escape now”. ‘We didn’t think the men spoke English but then one of the guys ran over to us and said: “Be nice my friends, or my friends will shoot you in the head’ and he made a shooting gesture. ‘We were so scared that we didn’t try to run after that.’","Melissa Reid, 19, and Michaella McCollum Connolly, 20, found with £1.5m .

The family of an American prisoner-of-war captured four years ago in Afghanistan have been given new hope after receiving a letter they believe was written by him. Sgt Bowe Bergdahl of Hailey, Idaho, disappeared from his base in Afghanistan on June 30, 2009, and is believed to be in Pakistan. His mother and father in Idaho issued a statement on Thursday saying they've received a letter they are confident was written by their 27-year-old son. Scroll down for video .

In the statement, Bob and Jani Bergdahl say the letter, delivered through the International Committee of the Red Cross, gives them hope that their son is doing as well as can be expected in the circumstances. They thanked the Red Cross for its help and support - and renewed their plea for his captors to release him. Dwight Murphy, with the Boise Valley POW/MIA, told KTVB he had an email from Mr Bergdahl saying that the family had no doubt after the letter that Bowe was alive as of two months ago. The family were being extremely cautious due to the highly volatile situation their son is in. It is thought that the 27-year-old is being held by the Pakistan-based Haqqani terrorist organization.

Mr Murphy, who along with Bowe's father refuses to cut his beard until the soldier is found, added: That [the letter] brings new found hope. 'That's like . sitting around a camp fire that's going out and all of a sudden you find . that one more log to keep the fire going.' The Bergdahl family have organized a tree planting ceremony in honor of their missing son on . June 22 at Hop Porter Park in Hailey to publicize their cause. The International . Committee of the Red Cross explained their role today when it comes to communicating with detainees.

The Red Cross Message service is available to all concerned families and the family of Sergeant Bergdahl has used this service. To give you a sense of scale, we distribute some 25,000 humanitarian letters of this kind every year in Afghanistan alone. To achieve this result, we have regular contacts with all parties to the conflict in Afghanistan who accept the ICRC's role as a neutral intermediary. As regards dates of transmission and addressees of individual letters, you will understand that in the interest of the concerned detainees and families, we prefer not to share such details.

"By . Ap . and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 22:34 EST, 14 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 06:18 EST, 15 January 2014 . The billionaire businessman behind Beanie Babies learned Tuesday that he won't go to prison for hiding at least $25 million from U.S. tax authorities, and the judge who gave him two years' probation instead went to great lengths to praise his charitable giving. H. Ty Warner, one of the highest profile figures snared in a federal investigation of Americans using Swiss bank accounts to avoid U.S. taxes, issued a brief apology before he was sentenced in Chicago federal court. The toymaker, who pleaded guilty to a single count of tax evasion, said he felt 'shame and embarrassment' for what he had done. Warner, 69, could have been sentenced to up to five years in prison, and a prosecutor Michelle Petersen asked U.S. District Judge Charles Kocoras to give Warner at least a year behind bars. Scroll down for video . Slap on the wrist: Beanie Babies founder Ty Warner Holding got probation for hiding $25 million from tax authorities . Peterson detailed how Warner meticulously hid his income - more than $100 million at one point - by filing false tax returns for at least 11 years, and pointed out that another area businessman caught in the same dragnet, Peter Troost, got a year in prison from another judge in that courthouse for hiding far less - $3 million. '(Without prison time), tax evasion becomes little more than a bad investment,' Petersen told the judge. 'The perception cannot be that a wealthy felon can just write a check and not face further punishment.' Kocoras, though, opted against prison time, and he devoted most of the 20 minutes he spent explaining his sentence praising Warner's charitable work. 'Society will be better served by allowing him to continue his good works,' he said, adding that he believed the Oak Brook toymaker had already paid a price in 'public humiliation' and 'private torment.' Enamored: Judge Charles Kocoras cited Warner's charitable donations as the reason for the lenient sentence . Warner, who grew up poor and had an unhappy childhood, according to his attorneys, created Beanie Babies in the mid-1990s. The small, plush toys resembling bears and other animals triggered a craze that generated hundreds of millions of dollars for his Westmont-based TY Inc. Forbes recently put his net worth at $2.6 billion. Warner maintained a secret offshore account starting in 1996 with the Switzerland-based financial services company UBS - shifting millions to another foreign bank when U.S. authorities began closely scrutinizing UBS. He even instructed the bank, under its rules, to destroy some records, Petersen said. But Kocoras said that, in Warner's case, his 'endless acts of kindness' deserved to 'trump' his criminal behavior. Lucky: Warner faced up to five years in prison for hiding income in Swiss bank accounts to avoid paying taxes on it . The judge recalled how Warner, after getting lost driving in Santa Barbara, Calif., pulled over to a parking lot fundraiser and told a woman with a kidney ailment that he would pay her $20,000 medical bill. He also mentioned Warner's $20 million charitable donation from proceeds from a toy he helped design commemorating Princess Diana after her death. As part of his sentence, Kocoras also ordered Warner to do 500 hours of community service at local Chicago high schools. When he pleaded guilty, Warner agreed to pay $27 million in back taxes and interest, and a civil penalty of more than $53 million - one of the largest such penalties ever paid. After the hearing, the U.S. attorney for Chicago, Zachary Fardon, said the sentence 'is less than we asked for but is not nothing.' He cited, among other things, the fines, community service and 'the abject humiliation' of facing federal prosecution. Billions: Beanie Babies earned Warner an estimated $2.6 billion, according to Forbes . 'I think that's the message folks should receive - that (tax evasion) is a crime that does not pay,' he said. Just before Tuesday's hearing adjourned, Kocoras said that as a formality, he needed to advise Warner that he had the right to appeal his sentence. The judge then laughed, adding, 'if you think you can get a better deal in the court of appeals.'","Ty Warner faced up to five years in prison for hiding more than $25 million from tax authorities .

A Connecticut engineer with dual, U.S.-Iranian citizenship was arrested by federal authorities last week after it was learned that he was attempting to smuggle thousands of secret documents - including blueprints for one of the U.S. Air Force's most advanced fighter jets - to Iran, prosecutors confirmed Monday. According to authorities, Mozaffar Khazaee had labeled boxes containing the documents as 'household goods' when he shipped them from his home in Connecticut to California on their way to Hamadan, Iran. Smuggler: Mozaffar Khazaee is accused of trying to smuggle plans for a top-secret fighter jet to his home country, Iran . Khazaee was arrested last week at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey as he was attempting to travel to Germany and then on to Iran, where he planned to meet a contact and turn over the boxes containing 'sensitive technical manuals, specification sheets, and other proprietary material' related to the F-35 and its engines to agents presumably with the Iranian government, according to an affidavit filed by a Special Agent of Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations. Authorities say the documents labled as 'household goods' initially was discovered in November, when Customs agents inspected the truck Khazaee had used to ship the boxes of documents across the country en-route to Iran. The shipping company Khazaee used described the boxes as containing 'books and college-related items, two suitcases, a vacuum cleaner and some other items,' Pricey: Developing the F-35 fighter jet has cost the U.S. government roughly $400 billion . According to authorities, however, the boxes contained 'thousands of pages contained in dozens of manuals/binders relating to the JSF [F-35 Joint Strike Fighter] program.' Khazaee has worked as an engineer for several defense contractors across the U.S. None of the defense companies are specifically named in court documents, but his latest employer - identified in court records as 'company A' - has been identified by the Blaze.com as Connecticut-based Pratt and Whitney. 'Pratt & Whitney has been cooperating fully with the government on this matter and will continue to do so,' Matthew Bates, Communications Manager at Pratt & Whitney Military Engines tells the website. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is reportedly the most expensive defense program in U.S. history. According to ABC News, the program costs roughly $400 billion, and is intended to 'replace the air-to-ground fighter attack fleets of the Navy and . Marine Corps, and work in tandem with the Air Force's next-generation . F-22 Raptor, an air-to-air fighter.' Future: Officials in charge of the F-35 program have called the plane the future of American air power . The program has been the subject of criticism for poor planning and production. But the Air Force maintains that it is 'the future of American air power.' Other nations appear to have taken notice of the program - even prior to Khazaee, and his link to Iran. According to published reports, the F-35 is listed as one of several major U.S. weapons system designs that has been at least partially compromised by defense hackers in China. According to court records, Khazaee has traveled to Iran at least five times in the last seven years. He's been charged with interstate transportation of stolen property of the value of $5,000 or more. If convicted, Khazaee faces a fine and up to 10 years in prison.","Mozaffar Khazaee has worked for at least three U.S. defense contractors over the last several years .

It has been written off many times, not least by designer Roland Mouret, but it seems that the 'Middleton effect' shows no sign of diminishing. This time, it was Pippa Middleton who proved the sell-out success after being spotted out shopping wearing the very same Alice boot by Seven Boot Lane and Aspinal clutch bag that she sported last week. But those who want to get their hands on a pair might not find it so easy: after pictures of the boots adorning her feet appeared last week, the shoes sold out in just 12 hours - along with the £795 bag. Pippa looked chic in navy and white out and about in London yesterday with her Aspinal arm-candy and chic Alice boots . The power of Pippa to move merchandise can no longer be in doubt as even the £750 bag is snapped up . Part of the Autumn/Winter 2013 Collection, Aspinal's Marylebone Tote is made from Italian Saffiano calf leather and is described by the brand as the 'perfect combination of style, fashion and practicality. The Aspinal website reported a huge surge in traffic when Pippa was seen with the bag for the first time and enjoyed a further spike when she carried it on her arm yesterday. Despite the bag’s hefty price tag, unprecedented demand meant that it has totally sold out. By contrast, the Alice boots cost a much more reasonable £150, making them the perfect way for aspiring Sloanes to emulate Pippa’s look. Pippa wore a near identical outfit - sporting both boots and bag - when she was shopping last week . The suede boots, made by independent Somerset-based brand Seven Boot Lane, disappeared from shelves within a day of Pippa's appearance in them - and have now attracted a growing waiting list, with more expected in-store on the 24th January. Speaking to MailOnline Seven Boot Lanes founders Sebastian and Mais Edwards say: 'It's an absolute delight to have Pippa Middleton wearing Seven Boot Lane. Pippa's natural style embodies the Seven Boot Lane woman perfectly. 'Alice has always been a popular boot but the impact of Pippa wearing them has been extraordinary.  The boot sold out online in about 12 hours - overnight basically - and nearly half the orders we have taken came from overseas, particularly the US. 'When someone with Pippa’s influence is wearing your product it opens up a whole new audience, all over the world.  Because she dresses in a way that is effortlessly stylish, people find her looks to be very accessible and therefore they trust the brands that she wears.

Hopefully we will be able to satisfy as many people as possible!'

Call off the search, close the polls, the votes have been cast and the winner of this year's most shamelessly adorable commercial has been decided. Featuring 30 snuggletastic fluffy bunnies, a magical online advert for hotel giant Ibis has been named the cutest of the year by marketing magazine Adweek. And they might just be right. To the dulcet tones of Richard Hawley singing Hushabye Mountain, the downy, lop-eared darlings flop about a London hotel room, all twitchy noses, stubby tails and teeny tiny yawns, weaving in and out of soft pillows and silk pyjamas and eventually huddling together in the centre of the bed to take a nice, long, cosy nap - some so sleepy they just drop with their little legs up in the air. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The star of the cutest advert of the year is this fluffy grey bunny, who flops on his back at the end of the commercial and falls asleep with his legs aloft . The most adorable sleepover ever, held in the ibis in London's Blackfriars . And as the video of the world's cutest sleepover steadily climbs the YouTube ranks - with over 70,000 hits in its first two days just - pet shops should probably prepare for a markedly steep rise in the number of enquiries into bunny rabbit purchases. Ibis, the largest hotel chain in Europe and part of Accor, launched the online film - entitled simply Snuggling Bunnies - to promote the brand's soft new Sweet Bed. The film was devised by creative agency BETC London and shot by Independent Films on location over two days in a top floor room at the the ibis London Blackfriars . It captures the bunnies as they seek out the comest place to sleep... and decide on the bed. One cheeky little scamp finds his way into a lacy silk pyjama sleeve during his hunt for somewhere cosy to sleep . Naming it 'this year's most shamelessly adorable commercial', Tim Nudd from Adweek said: 'Cats get most of the Internet love, but bunnies can put on quite a show of devastating cuteness as well -as displayed in this new spot from BETC London for Ibis Hotels.' Neil Dawson, executive creative director, BETC London, said: 'We really wanted to highlight the ultimate comfort of the Sweet Bed by ibis. 'Bunnies snuggle up to each other and find cosy places to sleep. And what better evidence of the ultimate comfort of the bed than for the bunnies to seek out and sleep there on their own.' Director Ornette Spenceley of Independent Films captures the bunnies' adventure through the soft, diffused lighting and framed visuals the cinematography brings the scene to life as a visually outstanding film. The lullaby soundtrack is a contemporary remake of Hushabye Mountain from childhood film favourite Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, originally sung by Dick Van Dyke and here performed by Richard Hawley. The new ad from ibis is a fluffy bundle of twitchy whiskers, wiggly tails, messy hair and teeny tiny yawns . No bunnies were harmed during the making of this super-cute commercial... but many of them did fall asleep . Karelle Lamouche, VP Marketing ibis Brands Northern Europe said: 'The video is a light-hearted way of emphasising the essential part of the ibis brand - the uniquely designed bed - and reminds people that ibis places a happy sleep at the centre of its offering.' Ibis' new beds - which are at the heart of the ibis megabrand campaign - have been rigorously engineered and include high-tech mattresses, a luxury mattress topper and an engineered box spring bed. Reading yourself a bedtime story is tricky when you're smaller than the book . In the absence of an adequate midnight feast, I'm just going to have a nibble of my foot .

Care: A five-year-old girl was taken into care by social workers after her weight ballooned to more than 10 stone, at least three times what is expected of a healthy child (file picture) A girl of five has been taken into care because she weighed more than 10 stone, it was revealed yesterday. The girl is one of the heaviest of her age ever recorded in the UK and at her peak weight of 10st 10lbs, was more than three times the typical weight for a girl of five. Yesterday experts criticised the failure to identify the youngster’s problem earlier and said the authorities should do more to monitor obesity in pre-school years. Details of the case were revealed through a Freedom of Information Act request, but the local authority refused to reveal more information for fear of identifying the child. It is not known whether any adults had been arrested over her care. The child, from Newport, South Wales, was taken into care in August last year because she weighed 10st 5lbs. Her weight increased to 10st 10lbs two months later, but dropped to below 8st this September. Earlier this year it was revealed that more than 900 children, including 101 under-fives, had been admitted to hospital because of obesity in the past three years. Tam Fry, of the Child Growth Foundation, said the Newport case highlighted the need for proper weight monitoring before children started primary school. He added: ‘We are failing our children hugely by not monitoring their growth from a very early age. About 25 per cent of our primary school entrants are seriously overweight.’ Commenting on the Newport case, he said he found it ‘absolutely astounding’ the problem wasn’t picked up earlier. Mr Fry added: ‘She would have been out and about and all over the place. Nursery school teachers will have seen her, probably she has been taken to the doctors several times, therefore the surgery staff and the doctor will have seen her. ‘It just throws up a whole problem of people wishing not to mention weight in case it upsets the parents or upsets the child.’ Mr Fry added: ‘This is the tip of the iceberg. There will be an enormous amount of children overweight, possibly dangerously overweight, where even the parents don’t recognise it.’ Joanna Nicolas, a child protection consultant, said the Newport case was among the most extreme she had heard of in her 18-year career. ‘I have never come across a five-year-old who weighs 10st,’ she said. ‘Why didn’t somebody do something sooner rather than picking it up at this stage?’ Newport City Council, based in the Civic Centre (pictured) in Newport, south Wales, made the decision to take the girl into care purely because if her obesity . Politicians in Newport called for answers about how the girl was allowed to get so fat. Conservative councillor Tom Suller said: ‘It’s a sad sign of the times. It’s really terrible that a child can end up this way. ‘There are a lot of obese parents out there and their children are ending up exactly the same way. ‘There . are other children in this sort of state – it’s a ticking time bomb. A . lot of people just think, “I’ll get a KFC tonight and McDonald’s . tomorrow”. They don’t consider the consequences.’ A Newport Council . spokesman said: ‘The wellbeing of children and young people is of . paramount importance and at the heart of all the work that is done by . our children’s services department. ‘It would be inappropriate to comment further on this case in the best interests of the child.’","Girl was at least three times the weight of the average five-year-old .

Two never-seen-before photos of Kate Moss taken during her first modelling-shoot have emerged after 25 years. The first roll of film used for the session was recently unearthed in a desk drawer by the fashion photographer involved and he decided to make prints from it. David Ross used three films during the shoot, with the first being a warm-up roll of pictures he took to help the 14-year-old aspiring model to relax. The images of Kate were later given to renowned model agency Storm and used to help launch her career were taken from the next two films. The first roll of film from Kate Moss's first ever photo shoot has just been rediscovered after 25 years . David, 48, first auctioned three photographs of the model's first . sitting in November last year and raised Â£5,700 at Bloomsbury Auctions in London. He has now had tow more prints run off from the negatives of the film to auction which also show Kate wearing a black silk shirt that David had given her to wear and are 'raw' portrait pictures of her looking at the camera. The images David gave to Storm were more 'commercial' snaps and show Kate wearing a Fred Perry sweatshirt. A few days earlier Kate had famously been discovered by a talent scout when she was waiting to board a flight to London from New York in 1988. David, from St John's Wood, north London, was hired to do her first photo shoot on October 26, 1988.

I thought she had the wrong address first . because she seemed quite young a lost. 'She wasn't forward or confident at all. 'I wasn't allowed to take any pictures of her because she was by herself so I told her to come back with somebody else and she did the next day. 'I took three rolls of films.

'These two pictures are from that roll and they have never been seen by anybody before. 'I didn't think there was any commercial potential in them because she looked so raw in them. 'The other pictures looked far more commercial and they helped launch her career. 'I enjoyed photographing her because she had quite angular bones. She looked so young. But these pictures portray her at the absolute threshold of her life changing forever. 'The negatives have been kept in my desk drawer pretty much since then. I am a bit of a hoarder and keep most things. 'My wife had been telling me for a while to have a clear out and I found the negatives and original contact sheet and decided to get some of the images printed. 'The two photos are from the original negatives from her very first photo shoot - the first time she had stood in front of a camera.'

Two people have been treated in hospital after being bitten by Britain's most venomous spider in south London. A man and a teenage boy in Sutton needed treatment after they were bitten by the notorious false widow species. It comes as there has been an increase in reported sightings of the false widow, Britain's most venomous spider, and more reports of people being bitten. William Fraser, 14, was bitten (left) at his home in on Thursday evening by a spider that is believed to be a false widow (stock image, right) The creature is capable of delivering a painful bite that usually causes a burning sensation and swelling but can lead to more severe symptoms including nausea and even loss of consciousness. Wildlife experts believe that long term climate change could be leading to spiders setting up home in new areas, but that many people were mistaking the common house spider for a false widow. They are distinctive for their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns on their backs.in the borough in recent months. The so called 'outbreak' of sightings has intensified with people spotting the creatures in their homes and gardens all over Sutton. William Fraser, 14, was bitten at his home Benhill Road on Thursday evening by a spider that is believed to have got into his bedroom. He woke the following day with a small bite mark on his forearm but by the time he got home from school on Friday his condition had worsened. Mother Sarah Fraser said: 'The whole of his forearm had swollen from elbow to wrist. Alexander Giordano, 39, of Broomloan Lane in Sutton, was bitten on his shoulder and wrist . His arm started hurting and his hand went numb and, as a childhood leukaemia sufferer, his immune system is weak so he went to A&E . 'We . gave him an anti-histamine and paracetamol. The next day he seemed to . get better but on Sunday he just got worse and worse. He was feeling ill . and he had to go to bed. 'We got him up to St Helier and the doctors and nurses hadn't even heard of false widows. 'When we showed them the article [in the local paper] the doctor seemed very concerned and wanted to keep him in overnight.' In the end William was allowed home following a strong dose of penicillin and his condition has improved. Alexander Giordano, 39, of Broomloan Lane in Sutton, was bitten on his shoulder and wrist. His arm started hurting and his hand went numb and, as a childhood leukaemia sufferer, his immune system is weak so he went to A&E to be checked over and was put on a course of antihistamines, antibiotics and cream for the affected areas. Spider experts say the animals only usually bite when threatened and if people are bitten they are best to treat the bites themselves and stop them from becoming infected. Conservation officer Greg Hitchock, who works at the Kent Wildlife Trust , called for calm over the false widow. He said: 'Lots of people said they have been absolutely sure that the spiders they have seen are false widows, but theyâ€™re not at all.  Itâ€™s not that straight-forward. 'The problem with sipders is that they are unpopular and not manypeople study them. 'Many of the ""sightings"" reported are probably not false widows at all. 'I think long term, global warming could have led to an increase in the spider population. 'But any warm winter weather we had last year was followed by a very harsh March.'","Man and a teenage boy in South London needed treatment after bites .

Even if he agrees to stay, he is expected to leave . at the end of the season. End of an era: The club have accepted the resignation of Cortese . Out: Pochettino is ready to leave Southampton and follow chairman Nicola Cortese . There . are now widespread fears among staff at Southampton that Liebherr, who . has no previous experience of running a football club, will decide to . sell. She has appointed . herself non-executive chairman and released a statement to say that the . process to find a chief executive to run the business had already . started. Incredibly, Cortese was locked in talks with West Ham over the £7million sale of Lambert. Cortese . and Lambert were scheduled to meet this morning at the club’s Marchwood . training centre, but that has been cancelled following Cortese’s . resignation. Lambert, . who has a restricted role in the first team, fears his World Cup hopes . will be in jeopardy if he does not get regular football. West Ham are unwilling to meet his £70,000-a-week wage demands but are still keen to sign him. Man in the middle: Rickie Lambert (front) has hit seven goals this term, despite not being first-choice . World Cup hopes: Lambert (front) has seen his first team opportunities limited at Southampton . Some . of Southampton’s players are furious with developments and a number of . the prominent members of the squad will consider their positions in the . wake of Cortese’s departure. Luke Shaw, who decided to stay last summer despite interest from Chelsea, is wanted by Manchester City and Liverpool. Liebherr values him at an astonishing £30m and will sell if a club comes in with a bid. Shaw . tweeted: ‘Gutted with that news, but would just like to thank Nicola . Cortese for everything he has done for me and the club! All the best to . him!’ James Ward-Prowse . and Calum Chambers, two of the biggest talents to come through the . club’s academy, will be targeted by top teams. Authority: Katharina Lieberr, the new non-executive chairman of Southampton, at St Mary's . Relationship: Skipper Adam Lallana talking with Pochettino on the training ground last week . Liebherr said: ‘With great regret we have accepted the resignation of Mr Cortese. ‘He has done a wonderful job at the club and we very much wanted him to stay. A search has now begun for a successor. ‘In . the meantime, it is business as usual and we will ensure that the . manager, the team and all the staff at the club have all the help and . support they need.’ Pochettino, . who led the club to 14th in the Barclays Premier League last season, . vowed to quit last summer if Cortese was forced out. Better than expected: Southampton currently sit in nine points after a terrific first half of the season . Potential: England youngsters such as Luke Shaw (pictured) has made Southampton an example of how to integrate talent from a club's youth system into the first team . That . has finally happened after Liebherr informed Cortese at the end of last . year that she intended to have more say in running the club. Cortese, . who was retained as executive chairman by the trust when Markus . Liebherr died, had previously resisted her attempts to take a bigger . role. The Italian . banker, who said goodbye to staff before loading his car with his . possessions and departing, wanted more investment to fulfil the ambition . of playing Champions League football.","Chairman Nicola Cortese quits after dispute with owner Katharina Liebherr .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 04:27 EST, 3 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 05:19 EST, 3 January 2014 . Ex-Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown has launched an extraordinary attack on the BBC, the NHS, the City and the media, warning ‘crumbling’ public trust risks triggering ‘public disturbance’. Lord Ashdown, who is in charge of the party’s election campaign, claimed bankers have their ‘fingers in the till’, the BBC was ‘complicit’ in the Jimmy Savile scandal and nurses who were once thought to be angels ‘turn out to be witches’. The 72-year-old said he is ‘surprised’ that there has not been more unrest in poor areas as a result of the recession, claiming a collapse in trust and morale has been caused by ‘the absence of hope’. Warning: Lib Dem election supremo Lord Ashdown said he was surprised  'crumbling' public trust had not triggered more disturbance on the streets on Britain . The Lib Dems have seen a collapse in their support since entering the coalition, falling from 22 per cent at the 2010 election to barely 10 per cent in polls now. Lord Ashdown admitted that the party he led from 1998 to 1999 could no longer count on attracting protest votes, with those disenchanted with the main parties instead switching to the UK Independence Party. But he warned that the rise of Nigel Farage’s UKIP was in part fuelled by a ‘the collapse of beliefs, the dissolution of institutions’ leading to people to ‘find an appeal in answers that are simplistic’. In an interview with The Times he said trust in society's major institutions is ‘crumbling into dust’. In extraordinary criticism aimed at the NHS, Lord Ashdown said: ‘The NHS, we are told, is to be failing right down to the level of doctors. Nurses were angels but some turn out to be witches.’ He attacked the BBC for wasting money and failing to stop a campaign of sex abuse by star DJ and presenter Jimmy Savile during decades at the Corporation. ‘The BBC is revealed as an organisation which can't manage its own affairs, misspends public money and seems to have been complicit in aggrandising someone [Savile] whose proclivities would be rejected by most people.’ Public trust: The NHS has been rocked by revelations of poor care, including at Mid Staffordshire Trust where hundreds of people needlessly died while the BBC came under fire for failing to act against serial abuser Jimmy Savile . Protest: The collapse in trust in society's key institutions has led more people to swtcith to non-mainstream parties like Nigel Farage's UK Independence Party . The collapse in trust of once revered institutions has created an ‘absence of hope’ which is being exploited by political parties outside the mainstream, he claimed. ‘You're seeing a shift to UKIP and a shift to Marine Le Pen. It can be left or right — the loss of confidence in the politics of the centre, of the three major parties, it seems to me is quite strong. ‘We are now a party of government, not a party of protest, and so you've got UKIP occupying that position.’ UKIP leader Mr Farage predicts his party will win the elections to the European Parliament, which would ‘cause an earthquake’ in British politics. Lord Ashdown also revealed his surprise that the riots seen I Britain in 2011 had not been repeated as the economy faltered. ‘I don't predict them and I don't want them — and I don't want to be scaremongering. But there is something very unsettling out there,’ he said. He added: ‘I cannot exclude the possibility that we'll see people who don't believe they can make their point within the political system making their point on the street instead.’","Lib Dem election supremo reveals fear of public disturbance on the streets .

Surgeries could be shut down after closing early without permission during the festive period, GPs have been warned. Hundreds of practices are suspected of shutting early on Christmas Eve and New Years’ Eve despite being paid to stay open until 6.30pm. NHS officials have now sent warning notices to a number of surgeries over concerns that patients may have ended up in overstretched A&E units after doctors went home early. Last month Dr David Geddes, a senior GP who is head of primary care commissioning at NHS England, told family doctors not to close early on Christmas or New Year's Eve . NHS England – which runs the health service – rang round 238 surgeries in London on Christmas Eve between 3.30pm and 6.30pm and found 5 per cent were already closed. They did not contact all 8,000 surgeries in England, but if the percentages are broadly similar then as many as 400 surgeries may have closed early. Officials carried out the same exercise on New Year’s Eve and are now in the process of issuing breach of contract notices to offending practices. These are written warnings telling doctors that their contracts to run practices could be terminated if they break the rules again. Commenting on the medical news website Pulse, which uncovered the story, some GPs argued that it was a ‘waste of time’ keeping surgeries open on Christmas and New Year’s Eve as they are traditionally so quiet. Dr Peter Swinyard, a GP in Swindon, Wiltshire, who is chair of the Family Doctor Association, wrote: ‘What a complete farce. ‘The number of calls that are after 3.30pm on Christmas Eve is always vanishingly small.’ But NHS England officials insisted that doctors still had a duty to care for patients, warning that there was a risk people would be redirected to busy A&E and out-of-hours services. And Joyce Robins, from Patient Concern, said: ‘Patients don’t know when they are going to be ill and if it happens to be during a normally quiet time they should be able to see a doctor. Family doctors should remain open until their normal time.’ NHS England ¿ which runs the health service ¿ rang round 238 surgeries in London on Christmas Eve between 3.30pm and 6.30pm and found 5 per cent were already closed . A spokesman for NHS England said: ‘From 15.30 on Christmas Eve we called 238 practices in London – 12 practices were found to be closed and were issued with a breach of contract notice before New Year’s Eve. ‘On New Year’s Eve we repeated the process and further breach notices have been or are in the process of being issued. ‘We undertook this exercise because we wanted to ensure that patients in London had access to the primary care services that they are entitled to which their GP practices had signed up to deliver.’ Last month Dr David Geddes, a senior GP who is head of primary care commissioning at NHS England, told family doctors not to close early on Christmas or New Year’s Eve. In a strongly-worded letter he said closing times were ‘non-negotiable’ and pointed out that the period could be the sole chance some patients had to pick up vital medication. He wrote: ‘The afternoon of the 24th and 31st may provide the only opportunity for patients who are otherwise working to attend to collect prescription medication and review prior to the festive season.’","Hundreds of practices 'shut early on Christmas and New Years’ Eve'

It is supposedly how the Duchess of Cambridge and Pippa Middleton slimmed down for the wedding of the century and counts A listers including Jennifer Lopez, supermodel Gisele Bundchen, and Welsh singer Katherine Jenkins amongst its past followers. But now the Dukan diet, brain child of Pierre Dukan and no stranger to criticism, has again been condemned by doctors. The high protein, low carb regime has come under fire by the British Dietetic Association (BDA) who warn that the diet is not nutritionally balanced and may increase risk of long term health problems. The Duchess of Cambridge, who personified slim elegance on her wedding, was rumoured to have used the Dukan diet in the run up to the big day . Carole Middleton's confession that the Dukan diet was responsible for her trim figure at the royal wedding sparked rumours that her daughter Pippa (right) may also have followed the regime . On the NHS website, the BDA says of the diet: 'Rapid weight loss can be motivating but it is unsustainable and unhealthy. The Dukan diet isn't nutritionally balanced, which is acknowledged by the fact that you need a vitamin supplement and a fibre top-up in the form of oat bran. 'There's a danger this type of diet could increase your risk of long-term health problems if you don't stick to the rules. The diet lacks variety in the initial phases so there's a risk you'll get bored quickly and give up.' While they acknowledge that the lack of calorie counting and initial weightless may be appealing to many, they warn that the negative side effects are highly unpleasant. 'At the start of the diet you may experience side effects such as bad breath, a dry mouth, tiredness, dizziness, insomnia and nausea from cutting out carbs. Both Gisele Bundchen and Jennifer Lopez have reportedly used the Dukan diet in the past to maintain their perfect physiques . 'The lack of wholegrains, fruit and veg in the early stages of the diet could cause problems such as constipation,' the NHS website states. Dukan is a complicated four-phase diet that starts with a protein-only approach which promotes weight loss of around 7lb per week. The first phase, which lasts for five days, is highly restrictive, allowing you to eat only from a list of 72 low-fat high-protein foods such as chicken, fish and eggs, and bans all carbohydrates except a few handfuls of oat bran. In this phase it also highly restricts fats and bans vegetables, unlike other high protein diets like Atkins. Dr Pierre Dukan is a controversial figure and his diet has come under fire from experts numerous times over the years . Although most foods are slowly re-introduced over the following three phases, the diet still advises having a protein-only day every week to maintain weight loss. This is not the first time the diet has been slated. In 2011 Experts from the British Dietetic Association named the Dukan Diet the worst celebrity weight loss plan to follow and said it has 'absolutely no solid science behind it at all'. The popularity of Dr Dukan's high-protein diet soared after Carole Middleton, (it and it was speculated her two daughters) revealed she had been following it. The following year in 2012 diet guru Pierre Dukan, faced being struck off as a doctor in France for giving 'dangerous' food advice to teenagers. The celebrity nutritionist was accused of breaching medical ethics for saying slimmer pupils should be awarded higher exam marks than their fatter friends. Dr Dukan said that pupils should be able to opt for an extra exam subject called 'ideal weight', which they could pass simply by being thin enough. In July last year Dr Dukan struck himself off the medical register voluntarily, just before he was banned by France's medical board from practising medicine and prescribing medicines. The 71-year-old Frenchman, is said to have lied to his patients about the Mediator pill, which has been linked to hundreds of deaths. Sitting in Paris, the medical board ruled that Dukan was guilty of a 'breach of ethical regulations' for prescribing Mediator on five separate occasions, and then lying about what he did. Dukan was also ordered to pay the equivalent of Â£5,200 in damages to a former patient who suffered heart difficulties in the 1970s after being told to take Mediator, even though it was only intended to treat diabetes. Presenter Phillip Schofield is one of any celebrities who have praised the 5:2 diet for their weight loss . The 5:2 diet, which sees followers fasting for two days a week to lose weigh, has been nothing short of a phenomenon over the past year with stars to politicians jumping on the band wagon. The idea that most of the time you don't have to restrict your intake but can still lose weight is highly seductive, and success stories abound about the eating plan. However the BDA warns that real scientific evidence of the diet's success is limited - particularly in the long term - and that the fasting days may result in dire health consequences. 'Skipping meals could make you feel dizzy, irritable, give you headaches and make it hard to concentrate, which can affect work and other daily tasks. Other reported side effects are difficulties sleeping and daytime sleepiness, bad breath and dehydration,' the website states. It also warns that people shouldn't view non fasting days as a chance to gorge as this will not only reduce the diet's effectiveness, but can be bad for your health. Their overall verdict is: 'The 5:2 is a simple way to reduce calorie intake. There are lots of versions of this diet, with some less safe than others. Many studies on intermittent fasting are short-term, involve small numbers of subjects, or are animal-based. Those on intermittent fasting diets like the 5:2 must avoid gorging and over indulging on non fasting days . 'If you choose to follow it, choose an evidence-based plan based on healthy, balanced eating and written by a dietitian like the ""2-Day Diet"". 'It's vital for your health to avoid nutritional deficiencies, dehydration and overeating on non-fast days. Never attempt to delay or skip meals if you are pregnant, have had, or are prone to, eating disorders or diabetes.' Jennifer Aniston is one of those rumoured to have followed the Alkaline diet in the past . This diet is based on the theory that modern diets create too much acid in our bodies which is turned to fat, as well as causing many common medical complaints like arthritis and tiredness. Despite many ultra slim celebrities such as Jennifer Aniston and Victoria Beckham having reportedly sworn by the Alkaline diet at one time or another, the diet has no scientific basis. The BDA says: 'The theory of the alkaline diet is that eating certain foods can help maintain the body's ideal pH balance (acidity levels) to improve overall health. But the body maintains its pH balance regardless of diet. The diet lacks evidence.' Although if you chose to follow a loser version of the diet there can be positives - such as avoiding processed foods, alcohol and sugar - which would also be advisable on any weight loss regime. More stringent versions of the diet suggest cutting right back on or even eliminating 'acid producing foodsâ€™ which include dairy. Dairy foods provide essential calcium so the BDA warns: 'When cutting down on dairy products such as milk, cheese and yoghurt you need to find other calcium substitutes, as cutting out an entire food group is never a good idea. 'The versions that advise cutting out entire food groups should be avoided.' The NHS website shares the BDA's verdict of many popular diets commonly followed, and the results make for bleak reading. From lack of evidence of the diets' effectiveness to health risks, there seems to be something wrong with nearly every diet. But luckily the NHS and BDA have provided those looking to shed pounds with a diet that they DO endorse. Intended for adults with a BMI of 25 or over (classified as overweight), the 12 week plan aims to help you lose weight at a safe and sustainable rate of 1lb- 2lbs a week. They advise that for most men this will mean consuming no more than 1,900kcals a day, and for most women, no more than 1,400kcals daily. The plan gives tips and advice, as well as meal and exercise plans, but does not cut out any major food groups. The diet advises how to spread your calorie allowance across the day to avoid hunger, but the suggestions can be altered according to your schedule. It also gives tips such as eating slowly and away from distractions such as television, as well as eating from smaller plates to make portions seem bigger. Breakfast: 280kcal . Lunch: 420kcal .

Anthony Weiner's latest online mistress Sydney Leathers may have been exposed to the HIV virus while filming her recent porn movie, it emerged today. The adult film industry in San Fernando Valley in California announced a moratorium on the making of porn films on Wednesday after an actor tested positive for HIV - sending shockwaves through the porn industry. The woman - who has now been named as Cameron Bay - revealed she shot her most recent sex scene with Xander Corvus, the man who played Anthony Weiner alongside Leathers in her porn debut Weiner And Me, released yesterday. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Debut: Sydney Leathers porn movie was released yesterday where she stars alongside Xander Corvus . Risk: Xander Corvus, left, who played Weiner in the movie with Sydney Leathers, had unprotected sex with Cameron Bay, right, a few weeks ago - who has just been told she has HIV . Cameron Bay spoke to Adult Video News to confirm she was the performer responsible for the moratorium on porn production. Cutting Edge Testing lab told Bay on Wednesday that a blood sample drawn the previous day came back positive for HIV. She told AVN that she was 'obviously extremely distraught and in . disbelief', and that an additional test will be conducted to confirm the . result. According to Bay, she received her last clean bill of health on July 27. Just days later she filmed an unprotected sex scene for a series called Public Disgrace. Her male partner was Xander Corvus. Gawker reports he and Leathers also had unprotected sex for the Vivid.com movie. Cameron Bay is not the porn star's real name. MailOnline knows her true identity, but has chosen not to print it. Cameron has worked under names including Ashton and Ryder, but before she embarked on a career in porn she appeared on VH1's Tool Academy in 2009. The show centers around couples who are sent to relationship boot camp in order to save their unions. The season ran for eight episodes, and Cameron along with her boyfriend of 10 years, Clarence - who had nicknamed himself 'Celebrity' - were eliminated in the third episode. Just two years before her reality TV debut, Cameron spent a year and six months in prison in Arizona. She was released in May 2008. She is also believed to have a total of 17 criminal filings against her. Saucy scene: In a statement to Gawker, Leathers . said both she and Xander got tested prior to shooting their scene, and . both were deemed 'healthy' Ecstasy: Leathers said she did have 'some boundaries' when shooting the movie . In a statement to the site, Leathers . said both she and Xander got tested prior to shooting their scene, and . both were deemed 'healthy'. However, the presence of STDs sometimes does not come up in tests for up to three months after exposure. It . takes the body two-to-eight weeks to make antibodies against HIV - . known as the window period. Tests done immediately after the exposure or . within this window period may not detect the virus and give a false . negative result. The CDC . recommends that individuals who have been exposed to HIV and have been . found negative before three months have elapsed get retested after three . months. Diane Duke, executive director of the industry trade group the Free Speech Coalition, told the Associated Press in an e-mail about the HIV detection: 'The moratorium will be lifted once the risk of transmission has been eliminated. Mugshot: Cameron Adams was jailed in 2007 for a year and six months . Virus: Cameron Bay, who has appeared in adult films since 2010, confirmed last night she was the performer responsible for the moratorium . 'In fact, since 2004 there have only been two cases of performers . testing positive for HIV and neither of those situations involved on-set . transmission,' Duke said. 'The current situation would bring the number . to three cases in nearly 10 years, not just in Los Angeles but . nationwide.' The industry briefly put a similar . moratorium in place last year after nearly a dozen performers were . infected during a syphilis outbreak. Word . of the latest moratorium quickly drew critical responses from porn . industry opponents. Among them was Michael Weinstein, whose group the . AIDS Healthcare Foundation successfully lobbied voters last year to . adopt an ordinance requiring actors use condoms in the making of most . porn films. 'How many adult film performers have to become infected with an array of preventable sexually transmitted diseases â€” including HIV, which is not curable â€” before the porn industry actually complies with the law requiring condom use,' he said in a statement. Since the ordinance's adoption, county officials have said they are investigating one violation. Assemblyman Isadore Hall III, who is pushing for the state to adopt a similar law, called Wednesday's news 'devastating and preventable.' 'Exposing workers to this type of harm would not be accepted in any other industry in this nation,' the Los Angeles Democrat said. The industry, which says its audience does not want to see condoms, is fighting the Los Angeles County measure in court.

Married couples are happier than those who live together, a major State-funded study said yesterday. It found that even though husbands and wives have greater doubts than unmarried couples about the quality of their relationships, they are more content than cohabitees. When asked if they are happy with their lives overall, married couples rate themselves much happier than other couples do. Content: Married couples are happier than those who live together, a major State-funded study said yesterday . The Enduring Love? study, produced by the Open University, said mothers were the happiest people of all. And in general, couples without children were happier than those who were parents. However, married people were happier than unmarried couples, whether or not they had children. The study, based on surveys of almost 5,000 couples, found marriage was associated with happiness despite the willingness of married couples to admit to flaws in their relationship. A cup of tea or an offer of help around the house can make all the difference in a relationship, according to the research. It said that an everyday comforting gesture such as giving a stressed partner a cuppa can have a big impact. Researcher Dr Jacqui Gabb said: ‘Many consider a loving gesture to be as valuable as hearing “I love you”. Grand romantic gestures don’t nurture a relationship as much as taking your partner a cup of tea in bed.’ Married couples were more willing than others to admit worrying more about the chores or money than whether they shared the same values. They were less likely to say they liked to make time for each other, and more likely to say they were drifting apart than that they were entranced with each other’s sense of humour. But nevertheless they said they were happier. The report said: ‘Both married and unmarried people without children are happier with their partner than parents.’ However, it found: ‘Married parents are as happy with life overall as couples without children and both groups score higher on this measure than their unmarried counterparts.’ The findings echoed results revealed by the Government’s own attempt to measure national happiness and well-being, in which surveys conducted by the Office for National Statistics found that married people are more satisfied with their lives than others. They come at a time of continued controversy over the lack of state support for marriage. Happy: The Enduring Love? study by the Open University found mothers were the happiest people of all . David Cameron’s plan for a limited tax . break for less well-off married couples, worth £3.85 a week, has come . under strong criticism from his Lib Dem Coalition partners who say the . State has no business subsidising one kind of relationship. Mothers are happier than anybody else, even if they have little regard for their husbands or partners, the research found. Despite evidence that in many cases their relationship with their partner was on the slide, mothers rated their happiness higher – at 4.1 on a scale of five – than that of fathers or childless men and women. The report said: ‘We can infer that children could be the primary source of happiness for mothers rather than their partner.’ Married people are, according to overwhelming evidence gathered over many years, generally better off than the unmarried. They enjoy better health and their children do better at school. But the new wave of academic well-being surveys that try to ‘drill down into embodied lived experience’, as the OU report puts it, are now signalling that marriage is likely to bring greater happiness with it. The Open University report, which was funded by the Government’s Economic and Social Research Council, said both married parents and childless married couples put their overall happiness at around 4.1 out of five. Unmarried couples, whether parents or childless, scored just over 3.9.","Married couples are happier than those who live together, study reveals .

"By . Martin Robinson . UPDATED: . 10:28 EST, 6 October 2011 . Hearing: Omaima Nelson in court in Santa Ana, California, in 1993 when she was jailed for 27 years-to-life . A cannibal wife branded the Californian Hannibal Lecter after killing and eating her new husband for Thanksgiving 20 years ago has again been denied parole. Egyptian-born Omaima Nelson, 43, who cooked William Nelson and ate his ribs with BBQ sauce, lost her bid for freedom after a five-hour hearing at the Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla, where she is serving a life sentence. In 1993 the then 23-year-old was convicted of murdering her 56-year-old husband in a grotesque killing that authorities likened to 'Silence of the Lambs.' The murderer represented herself at the hearing yesterday and argued for freedom because she has become a changed person and wanted 'to live the good life God meant.' She claimed she was sorry, though continued to say she killed in self-defence. 'If I didn't defend my life, I would have been dead. I'm sorry it happened, but I'm glad I lived, I'm sorry I dismembered him,' she said. Nelson had put on red shoes, a red hat and red lipstick before chopping up and cooking her husband's body. The authorities stated she prepared his ribs like in a restaurant and she said aloud, 'It's so sweet.' But at the parole hearing this week, Nelson shook her head and denied eating her husband. Not freed: Murderer Omaima Nelson provides letters of support to the parole board during her second failed bid for freedom . 'I swear to God I did not eat any part of him. I am not a monster,' she said. Commissioner Cynthia Fritz then asked, 'What was your purpose in cooking him?' Nelson declined to answer the question. Despite her plea a two-person panel of the state Board of Parole found that Nelson, a former model and nanny, continued to be a risk to society. Case: Orange County District Attorney Randy Pawloski takes notes as Omaima Nelson makes her plea yesterday . Commissioners said she had not accepted full responsibility for the slaying, nor completed educational or vocational programs while incarcerated that would help her lead a productive life outside prison. Nelson was 'blaming anybody but herself,' deputy commissioner Robert Barese said. Commissioners cited Nelson's criminal history, including shoplifting, car theft and assault with a firearm, and her failure to abide by prison rules, including violations for fighting, battering a staff member, hiding contraband, stealing, failure to comply with instructions and arguing. They also found that Nelson had shown a pattern of exchanging sex with older men for money and goods, which in the past had led to violence. Black widow: Nelson killed her newlywed husband and chopped and cooked his body parts over Thanksgiving weekend in 1991 . William Nelson's daughter Margaret Nelson - who was 15 at the time of the murder - gave a long, tearful speech in which she said her father's murder meant he couldn't attend her wedding or meet her eight-week-old daughter. 'I don't have the language to explain the pain of my father not being there,' she said. Mugshot: Nelson claims her husband raped her the night before she killed him . 'I don't know the adequate punishment for a murderer who doesn't even . leave a family a body to mourn over. But I do know you don't let her . out.' Nelson will not be eligible to seek parole again for 15 years - the maximum period she can be held without another hearing, the commissioners said. Nelson sat silently as her plea for parole was rejected. During the original trial, Nelson told jurors that William, her husband of three weeks, had sexually assaulted and beat her, including over that Thanksgiving weekend, and that she committed the acts in self-defence. But prosecutors found evidence suggesting that Nelson killed her husband to obtain his money and other property. She tied up her husband, killed him, decapitated, dismembered and disemboweled the body over the course of a weekend, churning his parts through a garbage disposal that neighbours said ran non-stop in the hours after the murder. Authorities found some of Nelson's body parts stuffed in bags and mixed with leftover turkey, including a bag containing his entrails on the floor of his Corvette car. They found the couple's Costa Mesa home had blood pools on the floor, blood-stained sheets and walls, and no evidence of rape. The man's hands had been fried in oil and his head boiled and stuffed in a freezer. Nelson denied intending to kill her husband or planning to take his money, but she admitted to stabbing William in the chest and neck with a pair of scissors, striking him with an iron and throwing a lamp at him as he sexually assaulted her. She said that after the slaying she 'freaked out,' fell into a trance-like state, and spent 12 hours hacking up the body to simplify disposal. She claimed to have little memory of his dismemberment, but recalled cutting off his penis and his ring finger, cleaning the apartment and packaging the body parts. Jurors found Nelson not guilty of first-degree murder, citing insufficient evidence of premeditation, but convicted her of second-degree murder. They also found Nelson guilty of assaulting a former boyfriend with a gun. Nelson appealed but lost in 1995. In 2006, she expressed remorse for killing her husband and sought parole claiming she had found salvation as a born-again Christian. She had also married an older man from outside prison, who has since died.","Omaima Nelson, 43, cooked William Nelson and ate his ribs saying they tasted 'so sweet'

The gallows used to hang an infamous prohibition-era gangster in one of America's last public executions have been discovered in a dusty old barn. Bootlegger Charlie Birger was hanged in the town of Benton on April 19, 1928. He famously went to his death with a grin telling the crowd who had gathered to watch: 'It's a beautiful world.' He had been sentenced to death for ordering the murder of an Illinois town's mayor and was one of the last people to be publicly hanged in the state of Illinois. Smiling on death row: This 1928 photo provided by the Franklin County Historic Preservation Society in Benton, Ill., shows bootlegging gangster Charlie Birger, center, on the gallows just before his public hanging in Benton . These are the wood and rebar pieces of the gallows that were used for the 1928 public hanging of Charlie Birger . Now, some 85 years after his death, a family has discovered the gallows used in his execution have been uncovered in a  barn near the city of Grand Tower, about 50 miles from Benton. They contacted administrators of the Franklin County Jail Museum in Benton, which has many items related to Birger, including his machine guns and bullet proof vest. The location of the gallows was last . known in 1973, when they were housed in the Jackson County courthouse . basement. They were pulled out for a Fourth of July event that year but then . the courthouse lost track of their whereabouts, according to WSIL-TV. Preservationists had been trying to find them for decades, but had no luck until now. The . museum will now house the real gallows inside, while a replica of them, . which were built in 1995, will remain outside the building. Piece of history: The gallows are built for the hanging of Birger in the town of Benton on April 19, 1928 . Charlie Birger, a Russian immigrant whose real name was Shachna Itzik Birger, was executed on April 19, 1928 after spending a year in jail. According to the jail museum, he was a . well-liked 'protector,' known for tossing coins to kids and even sharing . his wealth among a few neighbors in the southern Illinois community of . Harrisburg. In the mid 1920s he famously went to . war with the Ku Klux Klan who supported supported prohibition viewing . alcohol as 'un-American'. To law enforcement, he was known for for his bootlegging business, which he ran out of a speakeasy called the Shady Rest. The business is what led him to be convicted in plotting the murder of Joseph Adams, who was the mayor of West City, Illinois. Adams . got into the middle of a turf war between Birger's gang and another group . of bootleggers and as violence escalated, Adams wound up dead. He was . allegedly shot to death at the front door of his home by two of Birgers' men. Birger was later . arrested for plotting Adams' murder. Some . say Birger's smile on the day of his hanging could have been a result of the . dosage of morphine he was provided just before he walked to the . gallows. Others claim, however, that Birger had actually declined the drugs. The last person to be publicly executed in the United States was Rainey Bethea, a young black man who had confessed to the rape and murder of a 70-year-old white woman named Lischia Edwards. An estimated 20,000 people turned out to watch as he was put to death in Owensboro, Kentucky. The two men chosen to perform the hanging were Arthur Hash, a former Louisville police officer, who offered his services for free and a farmer from Epworth, Illinois, named G. Phil Hanna. Bethea's execution, which took place on August 14, 1936 was an unmitigated disaster. It had widely been expected that the hanging would be carried out by the sheriff of Daviess County - a Mrs Florence Shoemaker Thompson. Newspapers from around the country had sent reporters expecting to cover the first ever execution of a man by a woman. Instead Hash arrived drunk, wearing a white suit and a white Panama hat. When the moment came and Hanna ordered him to pull the trigger which operated the trap door sending the convicted man to his death, the drunken Hash did not respond and a deputy was forced to do the job instead. Hanna said it was the worst display he had witnessed in 70 hangings and the ensuing media circus led to authorities stopping public hangings.

The mother of a toddler, who was caught on video violently cursing, has defended her parenting today as it was revealed that the child had been injured in a gang shooting at the family's home. The little boy has since been placed in protective custody along with his 16-year-old mother Ennisha Devers, two other children and a baby in Omaha, Nebraska. The child and his mother have been separated but will find out on Monday whether they will be placed in the same foster home. The video of the child swearing and knocking over furniture went viral after the Omaha police union posted the video on their website to show the 'cycle of violence and thuggery' that they often come up against in their work. The video posting brought the police union under fire but the organization defended itself by revealing that the boy was recently injured in a gang shooting. WARNING: Video contains graphic content . The little boy is seen flipping his middle finger and cursing on the tape which was posted online by the Omaha police union . Ennisha Devers, the child's 16-year-old mother said her son was being encouraged to use bad language by her brother's friend and that she had no knowledge of the tape . The . video shows the boy wearing a diaper and being . harangued with racial slurs and obscenities by at least three adults. At one point, the child flips his middle finger, knocks over a chair and says: 'Shut up, b****.' With encouragement of the adults' laughter, the little boy continues to curse and swear. The mother says . that the video was filmed without her knowledge by her brother's friend. Miss Devers told CNN: . 'He's a smart little boy. All that cussing that he did, he doesn't do . that. Somebody told him to do that. My son doesn't do that. I don't . allow it.' She added: 'He had a clean diaper, the house was clean and like they said, kids curse, every kid does it.' A toddler who was cursed at and encouraged to curse in a video posted online has been placed in protective custody . The screen door at the Omaha home has a bullet hole after shooting which left five people injured in October . The Omaha police union said it found . the video on a known local gang member's Facebook page. The video has . been viewed several thousand times and remains on the union's website. According to ketv.com, recent court documents revealed the highly dangerous situation that the child was living in. In October, the toddler was one of five injured when someone fired shots through their front door. The . adults caring for the child repeatedly allowed known gang members into . their home - even after the state paid twice to relocate the family away . from danger. The little boy's father is believed to have been killed in a gang-related shooting at the age of 17. The boy's . grandmother was arrested on weapons charges in December after guns were . brought into the house while children were present. His grandfather is currently in prison for drug and felony charges. Facebook comments: People react to the video post from the self-proclaimed uncle of the toddler . Union President John Wells defended their decision to post the video saying 'a lot of these children end up dealing with law enforcement' The police union defended the video posting saying that without the public scrutiny that followed it, the children would likely still be living in an extremely volatile situation. A statement from Omaha Police Officers' Association website read:'This is 100% about a criminal culture, a cycle of poverty, a cycle of lack of education , a cycle of lack of parenting and â€“ dare we say ''a thug cycle'' â€“ that is literally killing families and crushing the futures of innocent children across Omaha.'

'It's . almost like the kid was abused twice: once by the people in the video . and once by the police officers association,' said Hamilton, whose group . promotes mentoring and works to strengthen families.

The North Korean long-range missiles that jangled nerves across the world when paraded through Pyongyang last month were 'almost certainly' fake, government experts and independent researchers have claimed. The weapons, which were showcased in a lavish show of military muscle to mark the 60th anniversary of the Korean war armistice, were heavily criticised by researchers who insisted they would be unable to fly let alone unleash a deadly attack on the US. The experts came to the conclusion, following an investigation by NBC News, after studying a series of high-definition photographs taken during the parade, held on July 27. All a big hoax: The retro rockets should be mounted to the left of this Hwasong-13 intercontinental ballistic missile .

'Undulating skin': One expert pointed to 'undulating skin' on the warheads that would create drag, pulling them off course and out of the sky in a matter of minutes . Whimsical warmongering: The experts came to the conclusion after studying a series of high-definition photographs taken during the parade held on July 27 . The revelation casts further doubt on the hermit nation's bellicose showboating after its failed Unha-3 rocket launch in April 2012. 'My opinion is that it's a big hoax,' said Markus Schiller, an aerospace engineer in Munich and former RAND Corp. military analyst. He said he saw no evidence of 'retro rockets' on the back of the Hwasong-13s, hardware that is necessary to propel them into sub-orbital space and strike faraway targets. James Oberg, an NBC News space and . missile expert who witnessed first hand the 2012 failed launch, agreed, . pointing to 'undulating skin' in the warheads that proves they are . bogus. Grandiose statement: Unidentified North Korean drones are displayed during a military parade past Kim Il-Sung square marking the 60th anniversary of the Korean war armistice in Pyongyang . Fake numbers: An expert added that North Korea also seems to be trying to inflate the number of weapons it claims to possess, claiming it reproduces old pictures of warheads to pass them off as new . 'Upper-stage missile skin has got to . be really smooth, or else it sets off high-speed turbulent air flow that . can both heat the region and also create localized drag effects that . can pull the missile far off attitude (direction), or even pull it . sideways and thus lead to loss of control and disintegration,' he said. Schiller . added that North Korea also seems to be trying to inflate the number of . Hwasong-13s it claims to possess, saying it reproduces old pictures of . warheads to pass them off as new . 'I . can tell that on the mock-ups, they simply changed the markings and . serial numbers from last year's parade to make it look like they have . more missiles,' he said. It is not the first time North Korea's missile capabilities have been called into question. In 2012, experts claimed the North Korean missiles that were . paraded as part of the 100th anniversary celebrations of the country's . founding father, Kim Il Sung, were also probably fakes. 'There is no doubt that these missiles were mock-ups. It . remains unknown if they were designed this way to confuse foreign . analysts, or if the designers simply did some sloppy work,' revealed a . researcher in a paper posted on Armscontrolwonk.com. Those missiles, called KN-08s, were loaded on to the largest mobile launch vehicles North Korea has ever unveiled. Not so impressive: The revelation casts further doubt on leader Kim Jong Un's chest-beating after its failed Unha-3 rocket launch in April 2012 (above) That caused an international stir with the weapons appearing to be new, and designed for long-range attacks. Along with developing nuclear weapons, North Korea has long been suspected of trying to field an ICBM capable of reaching the United States. Washington contends that North Korea's failed April 13 rocket launch was an attempt to test missile technology rather than the scientific mission Pyongyang claims. North Korea has a particularly bad track record with ICBM-style rockets. Its four launches since 1998 - three of which it claimed carried satellites - all ended in failure. North Korea also frequently overstates its military capabilities. Last year, one of its senior military leaders, Vice Marshal Ri Yong Ho, claimed his country was armed with powerful modern weapons capable of defeating the United States 'at a single blow'.","They were showcased in lavish show of muscle last month in Pyongyang .

The Indian government . has taken unusual step of revoking most diplomatic privileges afforded . US consular staff in the country - including immunity from prosecution. The . revocation of diplomatic privileges comes as the maid slave wage . controversy involving Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade threatens to . further erode India - US relations. Identity . cards issued to both consular officials and their family were revoked. Officials received new cards showing their updated diplomatic status, . their families will not be granted any special status. The move was . first reported by NDTV. 'Mistake': Devyani Khobragade's lawyer claims that officials made an error while reviewing a work visa form she'd submitted for her New York maid . The . Indian government changed privileges extended to US consular officials . and their families to bring them in line with what the US grants Indian . consular officials, a source told NDTV. This . new status will apply to all non-United Nations accredited consular . staff in the country and came after a significant development in New . York in Ms Khobragade's favor. The . United Nations Monday approved a request to accredit her to the Indian . mission to the UN, according to reports. This should grant her immunity . from prosecution of any form, but US officials do not appear to be . budging. A spokesperson for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara told MailOnline that authorities have no plans to drop any charges. 'As of this time, the charges stand,' the spokesperson added, declining any further comment. These . comments come after attorney Daniel Arshack accused authorities of . misinterpreting the salary paid to housekeeper Sangeeta Richard.showed . an intended salary and actual salary, according to the Times of India. The . intended salary was significantly higher than what was actually paid, . as Ms Richards' often failed to work 40 hours per week, leading salary . to be adjusted accordingly, officials told the Times. The . servant was paid $9.75 an hour with deductions taken for various . expenses and some salary paid in cash, the Indian government contends. US officials have also declined to comment on this assertion. Devyani Khobragade was arrested earlier this . month after being accused of lying on a visa application for her . housekeeper and paying her only $3 per hour . These . developments came as it was revealed a lawsuit filed months ago on . behalf of the housekeeper alleging poor working conditions. Philip Richard, Ms Richard's husband, filed a petition at the High Court in New Delhi in . July saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day. Mr Richard also said the consular . official's father Uttam Khobragade had threatened Mrs Richard's family . saying that he would have them abducted and framed on false drug . charges. The release of the . new document this week reveals that a legal complaint was lodged against . Devyani Khobragade in her home country prior to charges of visa fraud . being filed against her in the U.S. this month. Mr Richard's claim was . dismissed later in July because the Indian court had 'no jurisdiction... on foreign soil'. Consular . official Dr Khobragade was arrested this month as she dropped her . children off at their Manhattan school. She is accused of lying on a . visa application for Mrs Richard with prosecutors claiming she only paid . the servant $3 per hour. Philip Richard, the husband of housekeeper Sangeeta Richard (pictured), filed a court petition in New Delhi saying that his wife was being worked from 6am to 11pm every day by diplomat Devyani Khobragade in New York . In the petition, first seen by Outlookindia.com, . a concerned Mr Richard wrote: 'The treatment of Sangeeta by Devyani . Khobragade is tantamount to keeping a person in slavery-like conditions . or keeping a person in bondage.' The . petition also stated: 'Uttam Khobragade called Sangeeta's family . several times and threatened them that they would have to face dire . consequences if she complains and that he would ruin their future, get . them abducted and frame false charges of drugs against them.' Mr . Richard also wrote that Khobragade had accused his wife of stealing in . front of a U.S. immigration officer but would not provide details of . what the woman took. Mrs . Richard's daughter Jennifer also wrote a letter to U.S. officials . saying that her mother was unhappy and wanted to return to India but the . diplomat refused to let her go. Mr . Richard's claim was dismissed in July, according to his lawyer, because . the high court claimed 'no jurisdiction on a crime committed on foreign . soil'. The case has . escalated into an international incident with Indians reacting with fury . over the treatment of Khobragade who claims she was strip searched at a . New York jail before being held in a cell with drug addicts and sex workers. Uttam Khobragade, father of Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade, has been accused of harassing the family of her housekeeper after they complained about her treatment . Prosecutors allege that Khobragade falsely signed visa documents for the worker saying that she would be paid $4,500 a month. Then, . when the housekeeper came to the U.S., Khobragade told her that she . would be making only 30,000 rupees a month - less than $600, according . to prosecutors. India's foreign minister has demanded the U.S. drop charges against Khobragade. Although Secretary of State John Kerry made a phone call to Indian officials last week to placate the situation, Mr Bharara released a . statement saying that . the charges would not be dropped. The . statement read: 'One wonders why there is so much outrage about the . alleged treatment of the Indian national accused of perpetrating these . acts, but precious little outrage about the alleged treatment of the . Indian victim and her spouse?' Attorney Dana Sussman, who is . representing Mrs Richard though the non-profit victim assistance agency Safe . Horizon, spoke on Sunday of her ‘frustration and disappointment’ that . focus had slipped from ‘crimes that were committed’ to ‘the criminal . defendant. She pointed out . that the case was about Dr Khobragade allegedly lying to the federal . government about the wages she was paying Mrs Richard. Mrs Richard has claimed she as paid just $3.31 an hour, below minium wage. In the dock: An artist's sketch of Devyani Khobragade at her arraignment in Manhattan Federal Court last week . Protesters in the eastern Indian city of Bhubaneswar, burn an effigy of Barack Obama as the international fall-out of Dr Khobragade's domestic dispute continues to escalate . Ms Sussman refused to comment on her client and her family’s whereabouts since Mrs Richard walked out of her job in June. Dana Sussman, who is representing Sangeeta Richard, she says the real story of the alleged fraud has been lost in the diplomatic row . Mrs . Richard’s husband Philip and parents flew to the U.S. two days before . police swooped on Khobragade and arresting her at the gates of her . daughter’s Upper East Side school.

Secretary . of State John Kerry expressed his ‘regret as well as his concern’ over . the incident in a telephone call to Indian National Security Advisor . Shivshanker Menon.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 04:33 EST, 9 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:55 EST, 9 October 2012 . North Korea today warned that mainland America is now within range of its missiles as it accused the U.S. of conspiring with South Korea. It comes after Seoul announced that it has . reached a deal with Washington allowing it to nearly triple the . range of its missiles to better cope with North Korean nuclear threats. North Korea claims the move proves that the allies are plotting to invade the country - calling the deal a 'product of another conspiracy of the master and the stooge' to 'ignite a war' against the North. Warning: North Korea, which displayed an array of missiles during a military parade in honour of the 100th birthday of the late North Korean leader Kim Il-Sung in Pyongyang, claims it has missiles capable of reaching mainland America . South Korea, pictured displaying missiles with a maximum range of 180 kilometers during a parade marking the country's Armed Forces Day in Seoul, has made a deal with the U.S. to nearly triple the range of its missiles . In a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency, a spokesman at the powerful National Defence Commission said the North would bolster its military preparedness. He said: 'We do not hide... the strategic rocket forces are keeping within the scope of strike not only the bases of the puppet forces and the US imperialist aggression forces' bases in the inviolable land of Korea but also Japan, Guam and the US mainland.' South Korea's Defence Ministry said it has no official comment on the North's statement but Seoul and Washington have repeatedly said they have no intention of attacking North Korea. North Korean long-range rockets are believed to have a range of up to about 4,160 miles (6,700km), putting parts of Alaska within reach, according to South Korea's Defence Ministry. But the North's patchy record in test launches raises doubts about whether it is truly capable of an attack. Launch pad: The Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies claims these structures represent gantry footings, a flame trench and propellant buildings for a new launch pad near the village of Musudan-ri on the northeast coast of North Korea . Earlier launch: A rocket lifts off from Musudan-ri, North Korea, in 2009 . Pyongyang shocked Japan in 1998 when it . sent a rocket over Japan's main island and into the Pacific. That also . alarmed Washington because about 50,000 US troops are deployed in Japan . and their bases could be within the North's range. Tokyo and Washington . have since intensified their ballistic missile defences. But the North's most recent rocket launch, in April, ended in humiliating failure shortly after lift-off. North Korea said it was trying to launch a satellite with that launch, but the US and other countries said it was actually a test of long-range missile technology. The failure suggests that Pyongyang has yet to master the technology it needs to control multi-stage rockets - a key capability if it is to threaten the United States with intercontinental ballistic missiles. And although North Korea is believed to have a small nuclear arsenal, experts do not believe it has mastered the miniaturisation technology required to mount a nuclear weapon on a long-range rocket. It is unusual for the North to say its missiles are capable of striking the US, but North Korea has regularly issued harsh rhetoric against Seoul and Washington. Kim Jong-un pays a visit to Unit 158 of the navy of the North Korean People's Army . Deal: South Korean mock missiles are silhouetted at the Korea War Memorial Museum in Seoul, South Korea, as the country reveals the U.S. has agreed to allow it to develop longer-range missiles that could strike all of North Korea . Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korean studies professor based in Seoul, said the North had no choice but to respond to South Korea's extended missile range but it is unlikely to launch a provocation, as it is waiting for the results of US and South Korean presidential elections. Under the new deal with the US, South Korea will be able to possess ballistic missiles with a range of up to 500 miles (800km). South Korea will continue to limit the payload to 1,100lb (500kg) for ballistic missiles with a 500-mile (800km) range, but it will be able to use heavier payloads for missiles with shorter ranges. A previous 2001 accord with Washington had barred South Korea from deploying ballistic missiles with a range of more than 186 miles (300m) and a payload of more than 1,100lb (500kg) because of concerns about a regional arms race. The Korean Peninsula remains officially at war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. The US stations about 28,500 troops in South Korea as deterrence against possible aggression from North Korea.","North Korea made claim as it accused U.S. of 'conspiring' with Seoul .

Fugitive software tycoon John McAfee claims he used a body double carrying a North Korean passport to escape from Belize where he fears being executed for the murder of an American businessman. The eccentric millionaire, 67, is currently believed to be on the run in Guatemala with a 20-year-old female companion called Sam and two journalists from the arts and culture magazine Vice. A post on his own blog, uploaded over the weekend, claimed he had been arrested attempting to cross into Mexico, although officials in Belize denied this was the case. Scroll down for video . Latest twist: Fugitive software developer John McAfee, says . he has escaped Belize after his body double, who was carrying a North Korean passport, was arrested on the Mexican border . Wish you were here? McAfee appeared to be hiding out at a home in Guatemala (pinpointed by the red dot) after a photo of him contained data of map coordinates . But in a later blog entry, McAfee appears to suggest this was all part of a cunning ruse involving the use of a body double. The . post reads: 'We are not in Belize, but not quite out of the woods yet. I will do a more detailed posting later today if all goes well. 'My ""double"", carrying on (sic) a North Korean passport under my name, was . in fact detained in Mexico for pre-planned misbehavior, but due to . indifference on the part of authorities was evicted from the jail and . was unable to serve his intended purpose in our exit plan. 'He is now safely out of Mexico.' It is not known whether there is any truth in these claims or indeed if the posts were uploaded by McAfee himself. Where in the world is he? A new photo published online today appears to show that John McAfee is in Guatemala . Is the game up? Several Twitter followers quickly noticed that the metadata in Vice's photo showed its location in Guatemala . McAfee did not describe the entire plan, . nor did he say where exactly he was now. In a previous interview, . McAfee had said he had no plans to leave Belize. 'I'm not going to leave this . country,' he said. 'I love this country, this is my home. I intend to . fight the injustice that's here from here, I can't do much from outside, . can I?' It is the latest bizarre twist in the increasingly peculiar story of . the eccentric anti-virus company founder wanted for questioning in . connection with the killing of neighbour Gregory Viant Faull. Police in Belize have called him a . 'person of interest' in the killing of Faull and asked him to turn himself in for questioning. Faull . was shot to death in early November. McAfee acknowledges that the man had . complained about his dogs, which were poisoned shortly before Faull's death but says he didn't kill him. Online magazine Vice has claimed to . be in the company of McAfee since he went on the run following the death . of an American expat on November 10. In an earlier incident,  Mr McAfee appeared to have inadvertently . given up his whereabouts after a photo of him was posted online using . an iPhone 4S which includes details of the location it was taken. Pastime: Gregory Faull posted several pictures of himself on his boat in Belize. He titled this photo 'new friends' On the run: John McAfee, seen here just days before the murder of his neighbor, claims he is being set up by the Belizean government . The photo of Vice editor Rocco . Castoro alongside McAfee, included metadata pinpointing their exact . location to a Guatemalan mansion surrounded by forest at the edge of the . sea. However the . millionaire then quickly posted on his blog an 'apology' to Vice for . manipulating their photo's location for his own safety. In an email, McAfee confirmed a . posting to his website in which he described, in what appeared to be . joking tones, how he mounted the ruse. In Monday's post, McAfee said he left . Belize because he thought 'Sam', the young Belizean woman who has . accompanied him since he went on the lam, was in danger. He . wrote: 'I left Belize because of a series of events which led both Sam . and I to believe that she was in danger of capture. She has been my . go-between and my eyes and ears in the outside world. 'I . decided to make the move. I will be returning to Belize after I have . place (sic) Sam in a safe position. My fight is in Belize, and I can do . little in exile.' Police sources in Belize said earlier today that they believed he was still in the country. The sparsely populated border between Mexico and Belize is unguarded and unmarked in many places. Rumors arose over the weekend that McAfee had been caught, but Belizean police quickly denied that. MacAfee has said he won't turn himself in because he fears he will be killed by Belizean police while in custody. Belize's prime minister, Dean Barrow, has expressed doubts about McAfee's mental state: 'I don't want to be unkind to the gentleman, but I believe he is extremely paranoid, even bonkers.' McAfee, who is extremely polite and coherent in telephone conversations, brushes off such accusations, telling the AP 'if people want to call that paranoia, they can do so if you wish, that will not concern me'. Paradise lost: McAfee claims to have left Belize whereas police said he was still in the country . McAfee, the creator of the McAfee antivirus program, has led an eccentric life since he sold his stake in the anti-virus software company that is named after him in the early 1990s and moved to Belize about three years ago to lower his taxes. November 10: Gregory Viant Faull found dead at his home from gunshot wound to head . Nov 12: Belize police search for McAfee as a 'person of interest' in connection with his neighbor's murder. McAfee goes on the run . Nov 13: McAfee says he is at a 'safe location' in Belize after saying road blocks had been set up around house and police want to kill him . Nov 14: Blog posts reveal millionaire is a fan of the drug 'bath salts'. Nov 15: McAfee says he has been donning disguises to avoid detection - as he still claims to be somewhere in Belize, unarmed with a young woman called Sam for company. Belize's prime minister urges him to turn himself in. Nov 17: Asks online community for help in preventing the police from tracking him via cellphone. Nov 18: McAfee claims he has been at home the entire time . Nov 19: Ex-girlfriend 'Francesca' reveals McAfee lives in constant fear and is paranoid . December 1: Reports that McAfee has been captured on the border of Mexico and Belize prove false . December 3: McAfee posts bizarre blog post saying that he has escaped Belize with the help of a 'body double' ruse in Mexico. Later Vice magazine posts picture of him with map coordinates in Guatemala - which McAfee immediately says has been faked  'for his own safety' He told The New York Times in 2009 that he had lost all but $4 million of his $100 million fortune in the U.S. financial crisis. However, a story on the Gizmodo website quoted him as calling that claim 'not very accurate at all'. He has dabbled in yoga, ultra-light aircraft and producing herbal medications. McAfee has never said where he's hiding. But in his blog, he has claimed to have disguised himself as a grungy street peddler and a foul-mouthed German tourist. McAfee's blog, whoismcafee.com, was updated on Monday shortly after noon with a message titled 'I am safe'. McAfee has frequently used the rambling blog to keep the world updated on his bizarre attempts to evade capture in the Central American nation, which have included dressing in outlandish disguises and swapping cell phones over to avoid satellite detection. McAfee has been the subject of police interest since his neighbor,Gregory Faull, a . 52-year-old contractor from Florida, was discovered with a bullet in his head on November 11. In the brief talk with a CNN reporter . last week, McAfee said: 'I will certainly not turn myself in, and I . will certainly not quit fighting. I will not stop my blog.' Claiming . that he will either be arrested or get away, clarifying 'Get away . doesn't mean leave the country. 'It means they will, No.1, find the . murderer of Mr. Faull and, No.2, the people of this country - who are by . and large terrified to speak out - start speaking out.' McAfee and Faull repeatedly had . run-ins with each other the dogs that the multi-millionaire owned and in . one interview with Wired claimed that the killers of Mr Faull were . looking for him in fact and not his unfortunate neighbou. In . fact, the last six months have proven to be one odd episode after . another for McAfee, which began in May when his home was raided and . police said they found multiple firearms and the 67-year-old living with . a 17-year-old girl. The CNN report also noted that police in Belize have said they don't consider . McAfee a suspect in the killing; they say they only want him for questioning.","New photo from Vice magazine appears to place McAfee in Guatemala .

"By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 19:32 EST, 15 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 20:22 EST, 15 January 2014 . The number of elderly patients being restrained by nurses and carers has doubled for certain age groups (library image) There has been a huge rise in the number of elderly people being locked in rooms, tied to chairs or otherwise restrained by nurses and carers, the NHS watchdog warns. For some age groups, use of such measures has doubled over the past three years. The Care Quality Commission is to carry out rigorous checks on how hospitals and care homes are using the techniques amid concerns staff are being too forceful. Its figures show there were 157 restraint orders per 100,000 population aged 75 to 84 in 2012/13, up from 71 per 100,000 in 2009/10. Another 265 orders were granted per 100,000 of the population aged 85 and over last year, compared with 129 per 100,000 three years ago. But these do not include the number of times staff restrained patients without seeking permission. The forceful measures – called deprivation of liberty safeguards, or DoLS – were introduced in 2009. Hospital staff must apply to their local NHS trust before using them,  while care home workers make an application to the council. Approvals can be granted quickly – in less than 24 hours – and campaigners say there is no excuse for not obeying the law. Common practices include putting patients in beds with high railings so they cannot fall out, leaving walking sticks or frames out of reach or strapping them in chairs with lap-belts. The CQC is concerned too many carers are restraining patients before seeking approval and possibly hurting or upsetting them. It is also worried that councils and NHS trusts are granting them too easily. In one instance, an elderly man with dementia was kept against his will at a care home after staff had sought permission from the council, the Care Quality Comission said. They refused to take him to the local working men’s club five minutes away and he became so miserable he tried to escape. The CQC is concerned too many carers are restraining patients before seeking approval and possibly hurting or upsetting them (library image) Two-thirds of hospitals and care homes fail to inform the watchdog when they have applied to restrain patients – and whether it was approved or turned down. The watchdog wants to check staff who were turned down did not do it regardless. CQC chief executive David Behan said: ‘We expect more focus on reducing the restraint and restriction of vulnerable people lacking capacity.’ For all ages a total of 11,887 applications were made in 2012/13, up from 11,393 the previous year. Last year a total 6,546 were granted, a rise from 6,339 in 2011/12 – and about half were for dementia sufferers. George McNamara, head of policy and public affairs at the Alzheimer’s Society said: ‘These findings point to a worrying lack of awareness and understanding of the use of deprivation of liberty safeguards.’","NHS watchdog warns for some age groups use of restraints has soared .

A 20-year-old girl broke down in tears after discovering she had been in the same road accident which killed her older sister, a witness told a court today. Rosie-Ann Stone is accused of causing the death of her sister Jennie Stone, 28, by careless driving after they were both in a queue behind a slow-moving lorry on the A165 in East Yorkshire. Lorry driver Steven Wragg told Hull Crown Court today that he said to Rosie-Ann as he climbed out of his lorry: ‘That was a big one’ - and she shouted: ‘That was my sister’, before starting to cry. Trial: Rosie-Ann Stone (left) is accused of causing the death of her sister Jennie Stone (right), 28, by careless driving after they were both in a queue behind a slow-moving lorry on the A165 in East Yorkshire . Mr Wragg, who was driving the HGV which the two women were trying to overtake on the road between Hull and Bridlington, said he initially thought Jennie was ‘driving like a bat out of hell.’ Prosecutors claim Rosie-Ann pulled out of the queue in her Vauxhall Astra to overtake the truck - but did not see that Jennie, who was further back, had also pulled out to overtake in her Peugeot 206. Mr Wragg told the court: ‘I looked in my mirror and saw something flying through the air. I must have seen some sort of collision with plastic flying. I was not sure what it was. ‘I saw the blue Peugeot come in front on me at an awkward angle as if it was not going to make it. I knew the driver didn’t look right - and when it touched the grass it seemed to lose it altogether. ‘It was more or less back straight and . went sideways into the tree. It careered across the front of me and . seemed to lose control when it hit the grass more. It all happened so . quickly. ‘It hit the tree . very hard. There was an orange flash and a bit of smoke. I saw a girl running down the road. I said “That was a big one”. She . shouted: “That was my sister”.’ Patrick Palmer, defending, said to Mr . Wragg: ‘You remember the lady (Rosie-Ann) being very upset. She was . effectively being hysterical. When you saw her she was not running to . the blue car. In court: Rosie-Ann Stone (centre), who was on her way home at the time of the crash, denies the charge . ‘She had been to the blue car and was . running back to you. You knew that a blue and a grey car had been . involved in an accident.’ Mr . Wragg said: ‘The lady (Rosie-Ann) was in such a state, other people led . her way.’ Mr Palmer added: ‘She was someone who was beyond . self-control?’ Mr Wragg replied: ‘Definitely.’ In . his statement given to the police at the time of the accident on . February 22, Mr Wragg said: ‘I saw a blue car pass me like a bat out of . hell and hit a tree.’ Also dead: The women were sisters of Private Gregg Stone, a soldier killed in Afghanistan in June 2012 . Asked . about his statement by Mr Palmer, Mr Wragg replied: ‘I might have said . that in the heat of the moment. It was not going over fast. When you are . doing 40mph, everything seems quick.’ Michael . Evans, a delivery driver who was driving a red Ford transit van and . witnessed the crash, told the jury: ‘The blue car (driven by Jennie) got . out and was passing me. I thought she should not have done that. I said . “Jesus”. 'She should not be doing that. There was a car coming in the opposite direction. My fear was she was not going to make it back in time to avoid the on-coming traffic. 'I was doing about 40mph, so maybe it was doing 50mph. I thought she had gone too far to the right and clipped the barrier. She lost control of the car and skidded across the road. 'I didn’t see another car bye or near the other car when it hit the barrier. It hit a tree.’ Meanwhile, . Humberside Police senior accident investigator John Rusted told the . court that Rosie-Ann failed to look in her rear-view mirror to check . before she pulled out. He . said: ‘However long Jennie Stone was in that offside lane, Rosie-Ann . Stone would have had a clear view of Jennie Stone behind her. ‘In . my view it is not safe to pull out if you don't have a clear view, . because you cannot be sure you are not pulling out in to the path of . another vehicle.’ Mr Rusted . told the jury he had visited the scene of the accident and that scuffing . on the two women’s cars matched, showing the older sister was . travelling faster at the point of impact. He . said: ‘In my view the most likely scenario is Jennie Stone had moved . out of to commence and overtake behind the transit van, behind the . (Nissan) Serena. ‘The . minimum distance between the two sisters is 27 metres when Jennie Stone . pulls out. We don't know the exact gaps.’ Mr Rusted added that the . likely speed of Jennie’s car was 50 to 60mph. Sisters: Prosecutors say Rosie-Ann (left) pulled out of the queue in her Vauxhall Astra to overtake the truck - but did not see that Jennie (right), who was further back, had also pulled out to overtake in her Peugeot 206 . He said Jennie would have been overtaking for several seconds. Mr Rusted added that even if she hit Rosie-Ann at 70mph as one witness estimated, the time to see her was ‘a couple of seconds’. Mark Ibbotson, a paramedic who went to the collision, told the jury: ‘I was asked to treat a lady in the back of a Nissan. She was very upset. ‘She said: ""Other cars were overtaking a HGV in front, and my sister was behind me. I pulled out to overtake too - into the path of my sister behind me”.’ 'There was an orange flash and a bit of smoke. I saw a girl running down the road. I said ""That was a big one"". She shouted: ""That was my sister""' Steven Wragg, witness . Under cross-examination by Mr Palmer, . Mr Ibbotson said: ‘She was extremely upset and hysterical. I believe she . is asthmatic. I treated her for an asthma attack. I think she was in a . hysterical state. ‘She . was crying. From my examination she had the typical asthmatic wheeze. She wanted her inhaler. I provided oxygen and a drug through a mask on . the face.’ Asked by Mr . Palmer whether it struck him that Rosie-Ann was thinking calmly, Mr . Ibbotson replied: ‘I don't think you could think in that manner after . what had happened.’ Rosie-Ann, of Bridlington, who had been on her way home, denies causing death by careless driving. She told police she knew her sister was travelling on the A165 at the same time. Jennie had recently moved to Skipsea from Bridlington and Rosie-Ann was helping her there until the return to Bridlington in separate cars. Rosie-Ann and Jennie - whose parents Angie and Robert, both 56, have been in attendance at the trial - were sisters of Private Gregg Stone, a soldier killed in Afghanistan in June 2012.

A few years ago he was wooing his future wife over restaurant meals funded by discount vouchers. Yesterday Martin Lewis, the consumer champion behind the website MoneySavingExpert.com, sold it for £87million. The 40-year-old personal finance journalist and TV pundit, who started the site in 2003 at a cost of just £100, agreed the deal with the price comparison website MoneySupermarket. He faced a furious backlash from some of the 7million subscribers to his weekly email, who accused him of being a ‘sell-out’ and suggested the site would lose the independence on which he built its  phenomenal success. One commentator named Sablade wrote on his forum: ‘A very sad day for your unbiased opinions – a sell out! We now need a new unbiased independent website.’ Another suggested that the site would ‘only promote companies that pay them’, while a third added: ‘Even if the site remained completely true to its founding principles, the commercial link will destroy people’s perception of independence and fairness. The site, however honest it may be, will not be trusted.’ Mr Lewis said he chose MoneySupermarket because it is not owned by any product providers and had signed up to an editorial code which ensures the website’s content will be free from commercial pressures. He added: ‘MoneySavingExpert.com has become part of people’s daily lives, far  bigger than the man who founded it, and now is the right time for it to stand on its own two feet.’ He will stay as editor-in-chief for three years, with the help of MoneySupermarket’s resources and the website’s existing 42-strong staff. ‘After that, the door is open for me to carry on, and I hope to do so, though perhaps with fewer hours than now, so I can spend more time on my media work and other projects I’m passionate about,’ he said. ‘These include getting financial education on the curriculum.’ Mr Lewis will receive £60million upfront in a mixture of cash and shares and a further £27million conditional on meeting targets over the next three years.

A 31-year-old man complained to police that his cannabis had been stolen - and found himself arrested for producing the drug, a court heard. Aaron Chambers shouted for help when men armed with baseball bats smashed their way into his home in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, after hearing about his drug-growing enterprise. Police arrived on October 9 last year to find his class B drugs in the cellar and arrested him. At a previous hearing, Chambers was branded ‘ridiculous’ by his own solicitor after shouting to police that his cannabis had been stolen. At his latest appearance, magistrates called him ‘daft’. James Weekes, prosecuting, told Kirklees Magistrates' Court: ‘A member of the public called police saying there was a man shouting for police. 'When they arrived he was in the house and told officers someone had broken into his house and stolen his cannabis. There was a hydroponics growing room in the cellar with six fully grown plants and three smaller ones.’ Mr Weekes said the estimated yield of the drug was 524g, with a potential street value of £4,400. Chambers, now of Slaithwaite, West Yorkshire, admitted a charge of producing the drug. He said he had bought some equipment from a shop on an industrial estate in Slaithwaite. Mr Weekes said: ‘He found out how to grow the drug by word of mouth and by the internet. Google is a remarkable thing. He said “I just enjoy it and I don't have an addiction”.’ Chambers received a similar conviction in 2002 for possession of cannabis, magistrates heard. Mike Sisson-Pell, defending, described his client as ‘naive’ in growing the drug himself. Call out: Police officers arrived at his home (pictured) in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, on October 9 last year to find his stash of class B drugs in the cellar and arrested him . He said: ‘His naivety extends to the fact that he didn't anticipate that people of a more serious criminal nature would find out about his small growing and attempt to steal it. ‘It was with considerable shock and fear . he found his address attended by four men trying to smash their way in . armed with baseball bats. 'What you've done has been daft' Barry Bedford, Chairman of the bench . 'He was in fear that unless he acceded to their demands he would be subjected to a severe beating’. Chairman of the bench Barry Bedford told Chambers: ‘What you've done has been daft.’ He ordered him to complete three months of drug rehabilitation as part of a community order. The seized cannabis will be destroyed and Chambers must pay £85 costs and a £60 victim surcharge.","Aaron Chambers shouted for help when men smashed into his home .

With supply low and demand high for Central London’s prime real estate, the only option for many wealthy homeowners hoping to expand in the capital is to go underground. But this is troubling Joan Collins, who has spoken out about her disgust at rich residents building basements in exclusive Belgravia, where she has lived since buying a flat there in the late 1980s. The 80-year-old actress - who was born in Paddington and looked at 60 different properties before buying her apartment - said there was ‘too much building work going on’ in her local area nowadays. 'It's shocking': Actress Joan Collins says there is 'too much building work going on' in Belgravia nowadays . She told Belgravia magazine: ‘It's really sad. I find it shocking that people are digging down to put in swimming pools and bowling alleys when they only live here for two or three months of the year.' In the past the majority of homeowners have extended upwards over fears of causing permanent structural damage - but the trend for so-called 'iceberg homes' is growing. Ten years ago, the number of planning applications for basement extensions in Kensington and Chelsea was just 64. In 2012 however, the number had soared to 307. Collins told the community magazine that she enjoys living in the area, with her favourite shops including the Walden Chymist pharmacy, bookstore Belgravia Books and children's store Semmalina. Where she calls home: Collins, who was born in Paddington, said she enjoys living in Belgravia (file picture) She added: 'I looked at about 60 flats in London. I wanted to be near to the West End and the theatres, and near to Chelsea. I love Belgravia, it's wonderfully quiet.' 'I find it shocking that people are digging down to put in swimming pools and bowling alleys when they only live here for two or three months of the year' Joan Collins . The likes of Andrew Lloyd Webber, Nicole Kidman and Roman Abramovich have all extended underground. However, doing so comes at a premium. Last August, millionaire hedge fund boss Reade Griffith was order to pay £800,000 to create a huge two-storey underground basement below his two adjoining Kensington townhouses. He received the unprecedented levy from Kensington and Chelsea Council when he was granted planning permission for the extension, which houses a swimming pool, spa and 'treatment area'. Development: In September, it was revealed Tetra Pak heir Hans Rausing (left, with his late wife Eva) was planning to build an underground basement at his property (right) in Belgravia . 'Iceberg' extension: The underground development at the sprawling Grade II-listed property will include a swimming pool, gym, cigar room, wine store, plant room with rain water harvesting tank, cinema and lift . Collins - who is known for her role in 1980s TV soap opera Dynasty - has been married five times, and her parents were nightclub hostess Elsa Bessant and music agent Joseph Collins. In September, it was revealed Tetra Pak heir Hans Rausing - who hid his crack addict wife Eva’s body in their Belgravia mansion as he struggled to face up to her death - was planning to go underground. The underground development at the sprawling Grade II-listed property will include a swimming pool, gym, cigar room, wine store, plant room with rain water harvesting tank, cinema and lift. Based on other recent projects in Kensington and Chelsea, it is estimated Mr Rausing’s basement - which is equivalent in size to nearly three average terraced houses - will cost £2million to build. 'Iceberg' extension: Tycoon John Caudwell plans to turn two mansions in Mayfair into a single dwelling . Mobile phone tycoon John Caudwell plans to turn two mansions in Mayfair into a single dwelling the size of Westminster Cathedral. An ‘iceberg’ extension will be created by excavating beneath the existing properties to make space for a vast games room, swimming pool, sauna, kitchen, salon, media room, plant room and car park. It will be 180ft long, stretching under each house and joining them beneath their gardens, which back on to each other in Mayfair. The result will be a massive single property of some 50,000 sq ft – a normal town house is about 4,500 to 8,000 sq ft, while other  mansions in Mayfair are from 10,000 sq ft. The ‘iceberg’ extension alone will cover 14,000 sq ft. Once complete, the mega-mansion will have 12 bedrooms - there are five in each house already and the plans include two more in the underground extension. Addition: The Griffiths plan to build a subterranean extension underneath two Kensington townhouses . A hedge fund manager had to pay a fee of more than £800,000 to create a two-storey underground basement below his mansion. Multi-millionaire Reade Griffith, 48, and his wife Elizabeth, 42, plan to build a vast subterranean extension underneath two adjoining Kensington townhouses at an estimated cost of £4million. Housing a swimming pool, spa and ‘treatment ‘area’ it is likely to add £10million to the value of the property. At about 900 square metres, the basement would be the equivalent to eight average-sized new-build family homes. But due to the sheer scale of the extension, Kensington and Chelsea Council asked for a one-off fee of £825,000 when it granted planning permission earlier this month.","Joan Collins has lived in Belgravia since buying a flat there in late 1980s .

The cameras are behind overhead signs telling motorists to reduce their speed to 60, 50 or 40mph at certain times - but officials have failed to switch them on since their installation started in 2009. Restrictions: Drivers who break the speed limit on the M25 are in very little danger of being slapped with a fine - because many cameras monitoring the road have allegedly not worked for five years .

But her appearance today is a drastic transformation to how the toddler looked just a few months ago after her head swelled to twice its size. These dramatic series of images chart her journey which has seen her undergo numerous operations on her skull. Doctors carried out her latest reconstructive surgery on Friday and the results are clear to see in these pictures taken of Roona at a hospital in New Delhi, India, on Christmas Day.

Roona's father, Abdul Rahman, said: 'We are happy. She is much better now. There was a time when she was unrecognisable.' Roona, who lives with her impoverished . parents in a village in India's remote northeast, was born with . hydrocephalus, a potentially fatal condition that causes cerebrospinal . fluid to build up on the brain. Her condition caused her head to swell . to a circumference of 94 centimetres (37 inches), putting pressure on . her brain and making it impossible for her to sit upright.

Rahman, who works as a labourer earning around Â£2 a day, said: 'We are very poor. We were not in a position to arrange for all the treatment. But so many people came forward to help.' Roona was admitted to the hospital in April and underwent several rounds of surgery in May and June when doctors drained excess fluid from her head and dramatically reduced the size of her skull to 58 centimetres. She spent 105 days in total at the hospital before being discharged in August. But she returned to the same hospital earlier this month to have part of her bone removed from her skull which was then rebuilt.

A thug who attacked a soldier from Prince Harry’s air base with a 'cowardly' gang who robbed and beat him unconscious has been jailed for more than three years. Mitchell Ambrose, 20, of Ipswich, Suffolk, took part in the assault on 21-year-old Jack Shilton - who had served in Afghanistan - along with four other gang members who were jailed two months ago. Ambrose was also sentenced for a ‘mindless drunken vandalism’ spree four months before the attack on the Army Air Corps serviceman, who maintains Apache helicopters at RAF Wattisham. Scroll down for video . Brutal: The gang demanded soldier Jack Shilton, 21, to hand over his wallet before attacking him in Ipswich . Violent: A court heard how the gang acted like a 'pack of wolves' as they beat Mr Shilton, 21, to the ground . Shilton was punched in the face and kicked in the head by the five yobs who stole his wallet and phone in Ipswich on June 6 last year. He lay knocked out on the path after the late-night onslaught. The louts were then seen ‘bumping fists’ as if they were proud of what they had done, the court was told. He suffered a bruised kidney, lumps on his head and suspected broken ribs in the incident. Jailing four of the men at Ipswich Crown Court in November - before Ambrose was also sentenced yesterday - Judge Rupert Overbury said they acted like ‘a pack of wolves determined on its prey’. The judge said there was an ‘element of degradation’ as one of the thugs booted Mr Shilton as he was slumped helpless on the ground and another dragged him along the road by his underwear. All involved: Mitchell Ambrose (left), 20, took part in the assault on the 21-year-old helicopter engineer. Jerran Hart (centre), 22, and Adam Poulter (right), 26, denied robbing Mr Shilton, but were found guilty after a trial . Matthew Kersey (left), 30, admitted robbing the soldier and assaulting his friend, and was jailed for 32 months. Jamie Duncan (right), 23, admitted robbery and was jailed for 30 months . Judge Overbury told the gang: ‘While your victim has served this country, your country, in Afghanistan, to protect you and the rest of us from the threat of future harm, you have behaved in a cowardly and despicable fashion. '(You were) a pack of wolves determined on its prey' Judge Rupert Overbury . ‘Each of you is a disgrace to your family and a disgrace to your community.’ Jerran Hart, 22, and Adam Poulter, 26, denied robbing Mr Shilton, but were found guilty after a trial. Poulter was jailed for three years and nine months and Hart for three years and six months. Matthew Kersey, 30, admitted robbing Mr Shilton and assaulting his friend Peter Scott, and was jailed for 32 months. Jamie Duncan, 23, admitted robbery and was jailed for 30 months. 'Cowards': The five men then continued to attack Mr Shilton as he lay defenceless on the ground in Ipswich . Injuries: Mr Shilton was left with a bruised kidney and several suspected broken ribs from the assault .

A woman of ‘very limited means’ has launched a legal battle for the right to ‘harvest’ her seriously-ill partner’s sperm so that she can have his children, it was revealed today. The action at London’s High Court is being seen as a potentially important test case, involving a man kept alive medically after a devastating series of heart attacks who could die at any time. The woman - known as ‘AB’ - says her partner - a wealthy retired investment banker who is being called ‘P’ - would have given his written consent had he known ‘he would be in his current state’. Landmark: The action at London's High Court (pictured) is being seen as a potentially important test case, involving a man kept alive medically after a devastating series of heart attacks who could die at any time . Her lawyers say she is P’s common law wife and they have been together for several years and had extensive talks about raising a family. P proposed marriage with a ring last year, and she accepted. AB is challenging a decision of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) preventing her partner’s sperm being retrieved from him and stored for future use, possibly abroad. High Court judge Mrs Justice Carr discharged a court order AB obtained in an emergency telephone application made to another judge on Christmas Eve allowing a hospital to carry out a harvesting operation pending the outcome of her judicial review application against the HFEA, the UK regulator that monitors the use and storage of human eggs, sperm or embryos. Her legal challenge is due to be heard over two days next month. AB’s lawyers had argued the order was . urgently needed because P was subject to a ‘do not resuscitate’ (DNR) order and might die before the hearing, but Mrs Justice Carr ruled this . week the order was legally flawed and should never have been made. Important case: The woman of 'very limited means' has launched a legal battle for the right to 'harvest' her seriously-ill partner's sperm so that she can have his children (file picture) The . judge also directed that the Family Division judge who hears AB’s legal . challenge should sit at the start of the hearing as a judge of the . Court of Protection - a court set up to safeguard vulnerable people - to . consider ‘what is in P’s best interests’ before going on to hear AB’s . arguments against the HFEA. AB’s lawyers told Mrs Justice Carr that P suffered his first cardiac arrest and was taken to intensive care in early December. A British widow made legal history last August by using her dead husband's sperm to try to conceive a child - even though it is still illegal. The businesswoman, who is in her early 40s,  had his sperm extracted without his consent in an 'act of desperation' while he was in a coma and close to death with a heart condition. It is against UK law to take, store, transport and use in IVF a man's sperm without his written consent. The woman has since his death undergone fertility treatment abroad. She obtained an emergency ruling by a judge to have her husband's sperm extracted because he was so close to death. The judge agreed to the procedure being carried out to allow her time to find proof of his consent. Despite this never being produced, she was later permitted to take the sperm to another country to begin IVF treatment. The case was the first time a British woman went ahead with such treatment without a court hearing. The HFEA did not oppose her bid, meaning the regulatory body effectively supported her and her doctors in breaking the law. Romania and Cyprus are among a handful of European countries where it is legal to use a man's sperm without his consent in IVF treatment. This case was different to AB and P in that the HFEA was not asked to give permission before the retrieval of the sperm took place. Her case follows that of Diane Blood, whose husband fell into a coma after developing bacterial meningitis in 1995 and later died. Doctors extracted Stephen Blood's sperm while he was unconscious. The HFEA instructed UK fertility clinics not to treat Mrs Blood, from Worksop, Nottinghamshire. However, after a two-year legal battle, the Court of Appeal ruled that it was her human right to travel to a different country to have IVF using Mr Blood’s sperm. But it also ruled that this was only because of the unique circumstances of the case and it must not set a precedent. By . Christmas Eve he had suffered four heart attacks and the DNR order had . been issued. AB said she had been advised he was in a ‘permanent . vegetative state’ and could die at any moment. The HFEA told AB’s lawyers that there was no power to issue a special licence to allow the hospital caring for P to retrieve and store his sperm because of provisions of the 1990 Human Fertilisation and Embryology (HFE) Act requiring P’s consent. The HFEA also said P’s hospital was not licensed to store gametes - the reproductive cells in sperm - and they should not be harvested ‘in circumstances where they cannot lawfully be stored’. Lawyers for AB are accusing the HFEA of . misapplying the law when it decided it did not have power to grant a . special licence for storage. The latest medical update, received by the High Court this week stated that P’s condition had stabilised and the DNR notice had been lifted. But it remained grave, and he relied on a tracheotomy for air and a nasogastric tube for feeding. The judge refused to make a protective costs order in favour of AB to limit the amount she will be exposed to if she loses her legal challenge. Her counsel Richard Alomo said she was ‘a person of very limited means’ - and her case raised important legal questions. Mr Alomo said: ‘There is clearly a public interest in having this issue settled once and for all. She (AB) wants to obtain a decision she genuinely and sincerely believes her partner would want.’ Rejecting the application, the judge said the case did raise a question of general public importance, but the information provided to the court about AB’s assets and means was ‘wholly inadequate’ to justify a protective costs order. She said: ‘At least at some time P has been a wealthy man, having made a great deal of money from investment banking before retiring.’ A HFEA spokesman told MailOnline today: 'The HFEA has every sympathy with this couple and the difficult situation they find themselves in. 'However, the law on consent to storage and use of sperm is clear: the HFEA has no discretion to grant special permission for sperm to be stored without the person’s consent. 'We have carefully considered this case, in which the HFEA has, for the first time, been asked to give permission to retrieve and store sperm from someone in a coma who has not given the consent required by the law governing IVF. 'We will continue to be responsive to the court and the claimant and take every step to ensure the case can be rapidly resolved.'","London High Court action being seen as potentially important test case .

Legal highs are becoming a bigger problem than cocaine and heroin in Britain, a Home Office minister claimed today. Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat MP for Lewes in East Sussex, revealed his concern over the dozens of young people who are dying or risking injury by experimenting with new substances. It comes after the 56-year-old said ministers were refusing to sign up to European legislation for tackling the legal highs because the proposal would restrict Britain’s ability to control the drugs. Tragic cases: More than 50 deaths each year are blamed on legal highs by campaigners, including those of Sussex University medical student Hester Stewart (left), 21, and Adam Hunt (right), 18, of Southampton . A review of legal highs was launched last month by Mr Baker, who joined the Home Office in the last reshuffle, to consider widening legislation to boost police and law enforcement agencies' powers. He said some legal highs could be ‘more dangerous’ than heroin or cocaine, telling the London Evening Standard: ‘People think they are safe and legal when they may not be. ‘So I have initiated a review of so-called legal highs, which are a particular problem at the moment and becoming more serious than some of the traditional drugs in many ways.’ Mr Baker added: ‘We don’t know what the long-term consequences of these things are. They are more of a problem because we don’t know what they are until we have analysed them.’ He said that the Government has decades of history about the effects of cocaine and heroin, which has helped them to come up with a policy - but no such knowledge exists about some legal highs. The politician also stated that young people whose . bladders were being destroyed by the controlled drug ketamine - a horse . tranquilliser - were now being forced to have colostomy bags fitted. Worries: Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat MP for Lewes in East Sussex, revealed his concern over the dozens of young people who are dying or risking injury by experimenting with new substances . Mr Baker pointed out that he did wish to say heroin and cocaine were not dangerous. More than 50 deaths each year are blamed on legal highs by campaigners, including that of Adam Hunt, 18, who took the psychoactive substances AMT and etizolam in Southampton last August. Sussex University medical student Hester . Stewart, 21, was also killed by a legal high. The cheerleader took the . dance drug GBL in April 2009 and was later found dead at a house in . Brighton. 'We don’t know what the long-term consequences of these things are. They are more of a problem because we don’t know what they are until we have analysed them' Norman Baker, Home Office minister . Mr Baker said earlier this week that the Government also disputes European Union evidence, which estimates 20 per cent of legal highs have a ‘legitimate use’. Mr Baker said the Government would remain involved in EU negotiations to shape the European Commission proposals. Ten ‘legal highs’ were identified last year for the first time in the UK by a specialist Government system that targets music festivals and tobacco shops. A total of 27 new psychoactive substances, also known as legal highs, have now been detected by the Home Office's Forensic Early Warning System since it was set up in January 2011. Official figures also show that the number of deaths being linked to legal highs soared by 80 per cent last year to 52, from 29 in 2011.","Norman Baker fears for young people experimenting with substances .

Daood Hussain, 28, of Bordesley, Birmingham, allegedly demanded his victim meet him for sex sessions or he claimed he would print X-rated pictures advertising her as a prostitute. The unemployed electrical engineer has denied 12 charges of rape and one of blackmail. In a police interview played to the jury at Birmingham Crown Court, the woman said he had demanded she meet him in the summer of 2012. He allegedly showed her a leaflet he had made, which included pictures of her in lingerie, along with her phone number, address and a caption at the bottom advertising her as a prostitute.

She was fearful of what he would do if she did not comply with his requests. ‘Her family would have been horrified to find she was allowing pictures to be taken in that way. She simply couldn’t bear to face the consequences that would follow if her family saw the document.’ In a tearful interview played to jurors, the woman told police: ‘I begged him not to do anything and told him about the situation at home. 'My mum had been in hospital. I told him he wouldn’t achieve anything but... he wasn’t listening to anything I said. He made up his mind that’s what he was going to do and that’s what he did.

Carol Tsoi, 64, of Wigan, Greater Manchester, committed suicide hours before her husband Kam was due to appear in court, charged with historic sex offences against four young girls. She was said to have been very anxious about Mr Tsoi's hearing - and this distress came on top of existing significant medical problems and the trauma of a recent bereavement. Mrs Tsoi did not leave a suicide note and had told her own doctor that she wanted to attend the trial at Liverpool Crown Court to support her 66-year-old husband. Bolton Coroner's Court was told she appeared to be in a positive mood when the whole family left their home in Wigan on October 12 last year to attend to a car boot sale. But Wigan assistant coroner Geoffrey Saul found that the 64-year-old supervisor took her own life later that day or early the next morning. She had retired to her own bedroom early in the evening, having declined an evening meal, and bolted the door from the inside. The discovery was made the following morning by son Michael, who had been staying over with his wife and children. She was lying face down on the floor next to her bed and was ‘clearly deceased’. Ex-soldier Michael had been forced to shoulder-charge the bungalow's bedroom door open after his mother failed to answer pleas to come for the breakfast which his chef father Mr Tsoi was cooking. Hearing: Bolton Coroner's Court (pictured) was told Mrs Tsoi appeared to be in a positive mood when the whole family left their home in Wigan on October 12 last year to attend to a car boot sale . The hearing was told Mrs Tsoi was already being treated for depression following the death of her own father and the loss of her pet dog Izzy. Mrs Tsoi was also battling diabetes, asthma, increasing problems with arthritis - for which she was facing a future hip transplant - and problems with sporadic alcohol dependency. She had undergone a gastric band operation in an effort to control her weight but was also suffering from bowel problems. Shortly after Mrs Tsoi's death, the inquest was told, Mr Tsoi - who did not attend - was acquitted in court of nine counts of alleged historic sex crimes against four young girls. Dr Stephen Wells, a pathologist at Wigan Infirmary, confirmed that Mrs Tsoi had died because of an overdose of drugs. Police ruled out foul play or trauma. In a statement submitted on behalf of her own GP Dr Sanjay Wahie, Mrs Tsoi was said to have had no thoughts about suicide or self-harm in her consultations with him. 'It was just one thing after another and she never fully recovered from something before there was something else. She was terrified about the court case and what may happen. I think she had had enough' Michael Tsoi, son of Carol Tsoi . Although she was concerned about the ‘accusations’ made against her husband and the forth coming court case, she ‘wanted to be there for him’. Michael Tsoi, her eldest son, told the inquest that the day before her death had been normal, with all the family visiting a car boot sale and then making arrangements to have a family car collected to be scrapped. He said that, since the gastric band operation, it was ‘quite common’ for his mother to decline an evening meal or to retire to her own bedroom earlier than the rest of the family, to read. He added that Mrs Tsoi had been locked in a downward spiral of physical and mental health issues. She had been treated at hospital for an anxiety attack and was deeply affected by the death of her grandfather and the family pet. He said: ‘It was just one thing after another and she never fully recovered from something before there was something else. She was terrified about the court case and what may happen. I think she had had enough.’","Carol Tsoi was said to have been anxious about husband Kam's hearing .

Nearly half of middle-class parents are worried their children will be worse off than them, a study will say. The report from the charity 4Children - which will be launched by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg on Wednesday - reveals that parents were more optimistic at the height of the recession. More people believe family life is harder now than 20 years ago - and middle-class parents are more anxious about their children’s future than even those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds. Concern: More people believe family life is harder now than 20 years ago - and middle-class parents are more anxious about their children's future than even those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds (file picture) A survey for the study found 42 per cent of people with average or above-average incomes were pessimistic about the chances of their children in life - and just 22 per cent were optimistic. But 37 per cent of those on below-average incomes were pessimistic, and 25 per cent were hopeful. It comes after the Government's social mobility tsar Alan Milburn said living costs and an ‘exclusion’ from the property market will see many children endure lower living standards than their parents. Along with his deputy, former education secretary Baroness Shephard, they believe the children of today could be the first for at least 100 years to be worse off than the generation before them.

The report by 4Children - established 31 years ago as The National Out of School Alliance - will claim that modern Britain has not kept up with changes in family life, reported The Daily Telegraph. It will propose various ideas over issues such as the protection of parks, as well as suggesting support networks for grandparents who have a rising responsibility for childcare in the UK. The Observer reported yesterday that the study will also say a quarter of parents think the biggest improvement to family life would come from more affordable, flexible or accessible childcare. Just 30 per cent of parents believe current childcare provisions are family-friendly, with the main complaint that they are insufficiently flexible.","Report reveals parents were more optimistic at the height of the recession .

Terrified: Marilyn Massie was battling cancer when a street attack left her bruised with broken bones . A thug who targeted a terminally-ill great-grandmother for her handbag ruined the last months of her life, friends said today. Marilyn Massie, of Ashington, Northumberland, was battling cancer when a street attack at the hands of John Elliott Cram left her bruised with broken bones - and terrified to go out. The 64-year-old retired nurse lost her fight against cancer last month on December 27, just weeks after Cram, 30, pleaded guilty to theft and left court with just a fine. Mrs Massie’s family remain furious that she spent her final days miserable and scared because of the thief’s attack. Family friend Debbie Ash, 46, of Ellington, Northumberland, said the mother-of-four never got over her ordeal in August, adding: ‘She spent the last few weeks of her life in total misery and total agony. She only left the house on three occasions after that before she died and that was for a hospital appointment.’ Mrs Massie was walking home from a pub at around 11pm on August 25, when she was knocked to the ground by Cram, just yards from her home in Ashington. The thief, who approached her from behind, stole her handbag containing her phone, money and inhaler, before cycling away. Mrs Massie was left with a broken wrist, broken nose and facial injuries.  Already undergoing chemotherapy for lung and spinal cancer, the attack came as a devastating blow to her health. Retired nurse: Mrs Massie, 64, of Ashington, Northumberland, lost her fight against cancer on December 27, just weeks after 30-year-old Cram pleaded guilty to theft and left court with just a fine . Ms Ash, who is also a nurse, said: ‘She had a smashed-up face, a broken nose, and a broken arm. She couldn’t go out the house.’ Cram, of Ashington, was arrested two weeks after the attack and charged with theft. Magistrates fined him £55 for the offence, and he was ordered to pay £85 costs and a £20 victim surcharge. 'She spent the last few weeks of her life in total misery and total agony' Debbie Ash, friend . Mrs Massie - who had three sons, a stepson, 11 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren – was supported by local residents, who began raising money to buy her Christmas presents.

These dramatic images show a teenager fleeing armed police at speeds of up to 100mph after he went on a gun rampage to pay off a drug dealer. Conner Newall, 19, hijacked a car at gunpoint then held up a village post office before attempting an escape in West Cumbria - forcing officers to scramble the police helicopter. Detectives tracked his stolen Vauxhall Corsa as he sped for 20 miles through towns and villages before being rammed off the road by a patrol car as he tried to turn into a country lane. As officers wrestled Newell to the ground, he pleaded for mercy, yelling: ‘I don’t want to die. I’m a dead man - I owe thousands.’ It was later revealed that he owed a local gangster £1,500. Details of the car chase emerged at Carlisle Crown Court where Newall was jailed for ten years after admitting armed robbery, possession of a firearm and dangerous driving. The incidents occurred just a few miles from where gunman Derrick Bird, 52, shot dead 12 people and injured 11 others before killing himself during a gun rampage in June 2010. Newall began his crime spree in Wigton at 12.45pm on November 8 last year when he ambushed motorist Donna Lancaster as she sat texting in her stationary Vauxhall Corsa. Newall pulled open the passenger door, and calmly told her: ‘Excuse me, but I need to borrow your car.’ Miss Lancaster, 51, initially refused but then noticed the teenager had a gun under his jacket. As she gave him the car keys, Newall pointed the gun towards Miss Lancaster’s face and told her he also wanted her mobile phone, before escaping in her car. Scroll down for video .

Miss Lancaster said she felt that ‘this was it’ and her ‘world was at an end’, the court heard. She feared she would be shot even as he drove away, said Rebecca McGregor, prosecuting. Just after 2pm, Newall - who was masked with a black balaclava - burst into a post office and threatened postmistress Gwen Hopkinson and a colleague Amanda Harrison with the gun. Miss McGregor said: ‘He said he wanted some money and Mrs Hopkinson laughed, believing he was joking. He told her he was not joking; that he was desperate and that he was sorry.’ Newall grabbed more than £1,200 from the till and drove off but the pursuit began after one of the women in the post office noted down the registration number of the Corsa. Armed officers, supported by a police helicopter, spotted Newall and then began pursuing him as he drove at speeds of up to 100mph along the A596 and nearby roads, driving through junctions and narrowly avoiding crashes.

Marion Weir, defending, said: ‘He now appreciates the terror that his victims must have felt. He wants to move forward and get on with his sentence and express an apology to the victims.’ But Judge Paul Batty QC told Newall: ‘You terrorised these women in two separate and very serious robberies.

A fishery bailiff has been kicked to the ground and stabbed after challenging poachers, in the latest in a spate of attacks on wardens. John Anderson, 53, was set upon with a Stanley knife after he challenged two men he had spotted with a dead pike in a carrier bag on the riverbank. He was also slashed with the knife on the sleeve of one of two jackets he was wearing. Police are now investigating the assault at Branston Water Park near Burton, Staffordshire. John Anderson, 53, was set upon with a Stanley knife after he challenged two men he had spotted with a dead pike in a carrier bag on the riverbank . The married father-of-one suffered neck and back injuries and had to be strapped to a spinal board to be taken to hospital . Angling clubs are now said to be considering making wardens wear stab vests after a rise in riverside attacks. It is believed the two men - described as Eastern European -  had caught and killed the pike and were planning to cook it. Mr Anderson, whose job is to check anglers’ rod licences and fishing permits, was discovered by passersby after the attack. The married father-of-one suffered neck and back injuries and had to be strapped to a spinal board to be taken to hospital. Mr Anderson has been signed off work and is unsure whether he will return to his bailiff role. The Angling Trust has warned of a rise in tensions on riverbanks due to the clash of cultures between British and Eastern European anglers. In the UK coarse fish are caught and released by anglers in the name of sport,. But species like pike and carp are a delicacy in Eastern European countries. In 2012, bailiff Bob Stead, 69, was attacked when he caught two men trying to harpoon prized coarse fish with home-made spears. He was punched in the stomach in the assault at at Stonar Lake in Sandwich, Kent. Dilip Sarkar, fishing enforcement manager for the Angling Trust, said: 'If you are going to fishing you need a rod licence and a permit but most assaults on bailiffs are carried out when they check for these. John Anderson with a Pike similar to the one caught by his attackers. It is believed the pair caught and killed the pike, a delicacy in Eastern European countries, and were planning to cook it . 'All anglers have legitimate reasons to carry knives so it’s very dangerous territory. 'Although rare, the attack on John Anderson underlines just how dangerous it can be these days. 'Part of the problem is the clash of culture between UK and Eastern European anglers. 'They fish for the pot and that has caused a lot of unrest in the fishing community. 'Pike fishing in areas of the country, particularly the Fens, has been very badly damaged because instead of returning fish they kill them. 'It is not over the top that angling clubs should be considering the use of covert stab vests.' Mr Anderson, a volunteer bailiff at the quiet waterway for 10 years, described the attack on him. He said: 'I went over to say hello and as I got nearer I saw they had a small dead pike in a carrier bag. I hadn’t seen them before so I asked them if they were members. 'One of them disappeared and the other one reached inside his jacket pocket. 'I assumed he was going to get his rod licence but instead he pulled out a Stanley knife and came at my face with it. 'I put my arm up to defend myself but as I did so I was kicked to the ground by the other man. 'It all goes a bit hazy then but I knew at that point I was vulnerable. They could have killed me if they’d wanted. 'Luckily I was wearing two jackets that day and the blade only cut the sleeve of one of them. 'I’m now in agony. I can’t work and I’m unsure whether or not I will go back to being a bailiff. 'I have called a meeting at the fishing club and plan to propose more is done to protect bailiffs, which could include issuing discreet stab vests.' A spokeswoman for Staffordshire police said no arrests had been made in connection with the attack, which happened around 9am on January 6. She said: 'The first offender is described as being white, and of eastern European appearance aged between 20 and 30 with rotten teeth. 'The second offender is described as also being of eastern European appearance and taller than the first. Both had fishing rods and were carrying a bag of fish.'","John Anderson, 53, set upon with a Stanley knife after challenging two men .

But critics have questioned why Lino Carbosiero, the hairdresser responsible for the Prime Minister’s side parting, has been given an MBE. The crimper to the stars, who has also styled Madonna, Adele, Sir Paul McCartney and Amanda Holden, was recognised for ‘services to hairdressing’ in the New Year’s Honours last week. Critics have asked why Lino Carbosiero (left), responsible for the PM's side parting (right), was given an MBE . His Twitter page is now full of congratulations from colleagues calling him ‘an inspiration to the industry’. It is understood that he was not nominated for the honour by the PM. Last week Mr Cameron was accused of the ‘worst kind of cronyism’ after a number of people close to him, including a City public relations executive he has holidayed with and a former deputy chairman of his local party, were given awards. Apprentice star Karren Brady, who introduced George Osborne at the Tory party conference, got a CBE. Mr Carbosiero has been cutting Mr Cameron’s hair for the past five years, having been introduced by the PM’s wife Samantha. He was credited with creating a slicker look for him, moving his parting from the right to the left, with shorter sides and more height on top. He said last night: ‘I just did what felt natural’, adding: ‘David Cameron is an amazing guy. Both he and Samantha are family people and really nice.’ Mr Cameron's changing hairstyle has often been the topic of much discussion in sketchwriters' columns. Mr Carbosiero is believed to be responsible for the Prime Minister's decision to change his parting from the right to the left in 2007 . The . decision to move his parting from the right to the left in 2007 sparked . claims he was attempting to look more 'butch' or cover up a receding . hairline . The father of four is a consultant . style director at upmarket hair salon Daniel Galvin in Marylebone, where . a cut and blow dry costs up to £72 for men and £126 for women. He . said he panicked when he received the notification of his MBE, saying: . ‘I didn’t expect the letter so I thought I hadn’t paid my tax!’ He said he believed he had been honoured for campaigning to have hairdressing recognised as a profession. ‘There are no checks or exams at the moment,’ he said. ‘I want young hairdressers taught in the proper way and to get a qualification that’s recognised. It’s more than just standing behind a chair and chatting.’ In a 30-year career he has built up a client base of famous names including Dustin Hoffman, Phillip Schofield and Ant and Dec. He has also written a newspaper column and done charity work, including raising £25,000 by running the London Marathon in 2005. It is not the first time an influential hairdresser has been honoured. The Queen gave her stylist Ian Carmichael, of the Dorchester Hotel’s Royston Blythe salon, a royal warrant in 2012, while Jo Hansford, who counts the Duchess of Cornwall among her clients, received an MBE in 2009. Daniel Galvin, who runs the salon where Mr Carbosiero works, is an OBE. Labour MP John Mann said the award to Mr Carbosiero took ‘cronyism to a different level’. He said: ‘It devalues the honours system. Anyone who the Prime Minister knows gets an honour.’ Fellow Labour MP John Ashworth said: ‘He deserves a gong – after all, it’s a tall order to make him [Mr Cameron] look good.’ A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘All honours decisions are awarded entirely on merit and decided by independent committee.’","Lino Carbosiero has been recognised for services to hairdressing .

The elegant three-bedroom flat worth around Â£500,000 has 360 degree views of Gosforth moor and is stuffed full to the brim of valuable antiques . The property is the result of meticulous planning and design by Mr Bond, and took a team of men four months to complete.

'The fact this apartment is the first outside of London to win it makes it extra special. It is wonderful to live in and when people come to visit they just say 'wow'. The dinner parties we hold here are fantastic. 'The last house we lived in was a huge mansion of a place I thought that I would feel claustrophobic moving to an apartment, but that hasn't been the case at all. The 360 degree views are amazing.' The couple, who have been together for 34-years, moved from their Georgian farmhouse in Newcastle after 80-year-old Mr Coombs slipped on some ice and banged his head.

Sadly, Mr Coombs, who was head of business at Northumbria University, was left with a bleed on the brain which has led to dementia. The pair decided to move because the neat open-space apartment meets their needs better than the sprawling mansion they recently sold. Mr Bond's intention was to design a living space which was 'timeless' and 'elegant' but with a 'modern twist'.He took inspiration from his antique collection to create the 'relaxing haven' which he describes as 'a space to live, a space to move and a space to be'. Mr Bond added: 'The award ceremony in London was a bit like the Oscars. It started at 6.30pm and my name wasn't called until 11pm. I had to stay sober until then in case I fell over. 'When my name was finally called I felt as though my feet were going to go from under me. It was a wonderful night.'","Inside the luxury flat in Gosforth, Newcastle, is sumptuously appointed .

Rev Simon Tatton-Brown, 65, questioned the existence of Santa in a special Christmas assembly . A vicar has been forced to apologise after he told children at a primary school that Father Christmas doesn't exist and instead told them the gruesome tale of St Nicholas. Rev Simon Tatton-Brown, 65, questioned the existence of Santa in a special Christmas assembly and then went on to add that the kindly character was in fact based on a gory legend about the saint, who brought three murdered children back to life . The Church of England vicar told shocked children at Charter Primary in Chippenham, Wiltshire, how the children were killed by an evil butcher and placed in a barrel to be pickled and sold as ham. Parents complained when their children - aged between five and 11 - came home shell-shocked and the vicar of St Andrew's Church in Chippenham, has now apologised. The blunder came as the reverend - who is due to retire at the end of the year after 13 Christmases at his church - delivered his annual festive address to the local school last Wednesday. Due to a technical issue he had to abandon his prepared talk and had to 'ad lib' without notes. It is reported he also claimed stockings exist only because of a myth about St Nicholas dropping a gift down a poor family's chimney which happened to land in a sock hung by the fire to dry. He said his biggest concern was that he had spoilt the kids' Christmases. Thankfully, the very youngest children from the reception class were not part of the assembly. But some furious mothers have already pulled their little ones from the school's Christmas concert at his church later this month. The Church of England vicar told shocked children at Charter Primary in Chippenham, Wiltshire, how the children were killed by an evil butcher and placed in a barrel to be pickled and sold as ham . Parents complained when their children - aged between five and 11 - came home shell-shocked and the vicar of St Andrew's Church in Chippenham, has now apologised . The vicar wrote to headteacher Sarah Flack to apologise. His letter said: 'I was very sorry to hear of the trouble following my assembly. I talked about St Nicholas, and the stories about him, which tells us why Santa Claus brings gifts at Christmas. 'I am sorry if this was misunderstood. Born in Asia Minor (now Turkey) in the third century to wealthy parents, the future St Nicholas dispensed of his inheritance by helping the needy. One story tells of him assisting a poor man with three daughters. With no money for dowries, the man was on the brink of selling them into prostitution or slavery. On three separate occasions, Nicholas threw bags of gold through an open window of the house - the gold was said to have landed in stockings hung before the fire to dry. St Nicholas became patron saint of, among others, children, sailors, students, paupers and -prophetically - thieves. But it is with Christmas that St Nicholas is indelibly associated, his image having morphed into that of the white-bearded, red-suited Father Christmas. One legend claims during a terrible famine a malicious butcher lured three little children into his house, where he killed them, cured them in a barrel and planned to sell them. Saint Nicholas - who was visiting the region to care for the hungry - resurrected the three boys from the barrel by his prayers. 'I fully support parents who want their young children to enjoy the Christmas stories, including Father Christmas, and I had no intention of undermining their belief in the reality of Santa Claus.' Mrs Flack said she accepted his apology. She said children had made comments to their parents at home but the school was looking forward to moving on. She said the school would still use St Andrew's for their carol service and would welcome a vicar at next year's assembly. According to the legend, St. Nicholas lived in southwestern Turkey in the 4th century and performed a number of miracles involving sailors and children.

Saint Nicholas - who was visiting the region to care for the hungry - resurrected the three boys from the barrel by his prayers. Parents dropping their children off have expressed their anger. Linzi Merritt, whose son Levi, nine, attends the school, said: 'We wouldn't just walk into the church during one of his services and tell everyone there that Jesus isn't real. He's a person of authority and it's not his place to be telling the children that. 'It's the older children who have suffered the most because their parents can't really talk their way out of it like the parents of younger children can. 'Loads of kids went home crying - it has ruined Christmas for them. It wasn't a nice story for children to hear, there were lots more he could have told. 'Not only has he spoiled Father Christmas for them, a lot of them are now questioning the existence of the tooth fairy as well. 'The school should have known what he was going to come in to say, they could have stopped him. Furious parents Linzi Merrit and Kerry Butler outside Charter Primary School. They said children are now beginning to question the existence of the tooth fairy too . 'He has been coming in for years now so who know what else he has told them - he may have even been talking to them about Satan. 'He sent an email of apology but it really isn't good enough in my opinion.' Kerry Butler, whose daughter Kacey Butler, nine, goes to the school, said: 'All the parents here are very upset. 'I think it's a lot worse for the older children because a lot of them are on the cusp of not believing anymore and this could have pushed them over the edge. In a statement from the Diocese of Bristol, Rev Simon Tatton-Brown said: 'In talking to the children about St Nicholas, I inadvertently said something that raised questions for them about the existence in Santa Claus. 'I am truly sorry for that and have worked with the school to apologise to parents and children for any upset caused. 'The reason I told stories of St Nicholas' life is that he tells us of the meaning of Christmas. He was someone who gave away his inheritance and was sacrificially generous, especially to children.

Fraud: Stacey Bann, 23, plundered more than £35,000 from her dementia-suffering grandmother's account . A young woman has been jailed for stealing her dementia-suffering grandmother's £35,000 life savings to spend the money on designer clothes and drugs. Stacey Bann, 23, threatened her parents with a knife when she was confronted over the missing money, the court was told. She obtained bank account details for 89-year-old Noreen Cunnington while visiting her home then set up a bogus account in her name at Halifax. Bann then transferred money from her grandmother's account to the new one on 23 separate occasions. She later took the money for her own use. Louise Gallagher, prosecuting, told Sheffield Crown Court that Mrs Cunnington was in the early stages of dementia after having a fall and is wheelchair-bound. Within a period of five months last year nearly all of the pensioner's £38,714 life savings were stolen. 'Everything had been withdrawn by the defendant,' she said. Bann started wearing expensive clothes and shrugged off questions by saying she could afford it out of her apprentice plasterer's wages. When her father noticed £9,000 had disappeared from Mrs Cunnington's accounts Bann just said her grandmother had given it to her as a gift. By August Bann had quit her job but she was still 'flush with money' and her father alerted his ex-wife, the victim's daughter, who found the money had been stolen. 'Both her parents expressed shock that she did this to her own grandmother, she would have given her anything she needed,' said Miss Gallagher. The victim told police she was 'upset and annoyed' at what had happened. She now lives in a care home. Bann, from Bolton-on-Dearne, South Yorkshire, was in tears in the dock as she admitted fraud. Jailed: Judge Julian Goose, sitting at Sheffield Crown Court (pictured), gave Bann a 12 month jail sentence . None of the money she has stolen has been repaid, and it is believed to have been spent. Judith Seaborne, defending, said Bann, who lives with her cousin, was a qualified plumber and plasterer but was now living on benefits. She felt frustrated at not being able to drive to look for a job and had been unable to work because of an old hand injury. Her seven-year relationship also ended in March last year and she became increasingly depressed. 'She's quite simply disgusted with herself and wants to repay the money,' said Mrs Seaborne. 'There's no reason or excuse she can offer for her offending.' She had been unable to see her grandmother to apologise and had difficult relations with all of her family. Judge Julian Goose jailed Bann for 12 months and told her she will serve half before she is released on licence. He told her: 'Over a period of five months you obtained £35,340 from your vulnerable and elderly grandmother. She was 89 and extremely vulnerable.' He went on: 'It was a determined and committed attempt to take money from your grandmother without her knowledge. 'It was aggravated by the fact that you knew your grandma would not check what was going on and she was suffering from the early stages of dementia.'","Stacey Bann set-up a fake Halifax account in the name of her grandmother .

The 78 Irish travellers - who hail from just four families - were told to leave their camp in Hardhorn, Lancashire, by the Court of Appeal in October. A four-year legal battle has already left taxpayers with an estimated legal bill of £200,000. Eviction: The gypsies moved onto the site in Hardhorn, Lancashire, overnight in a 'military-style operation' four years ago - after the council offices had closed for the weekend . Appeal: The group are applying to the Supreme Court for permission to appeal their case. They claim eviction would breach the human rights of 39 children living on the land . But they are now applying for permission to take their case to the Supreme Court which will delay their possible eviction further. They have argued that being kicked off the land would 'violate' the human rights of their 39 children living on the site as their health and educational prospects would be adversely affected. The gypsies moved in four years ago after launching what neighbours said was a 'military-style operation' after the council offices had closed for the weekend in November 2009.

'The . villagers have complained about these people poaching rabbiting and . roaming all over their land then harassing them and being rude when told . to behave. 'The numbers of . travellers there changes all of the time. At times there has been up to . 60 caravans on the land. They are illegally there and their behaviour . has been hugely disruptive.' The Court of Appeal ruled that there could be no further appeals - but lawyers for the travellers applied to the Supreme Court for permission for the case to be heard. Gypsy site: The council has spent £200,000 attempting to evict the travellers from the site which has been given its own postcode - enabling the inhabitants to claim benefits . It had been hoped that enforcement action could begin today but the attempt to appeal has delayed it. Allan Oldfield, chief executive of Fylde Council, said they had spent £200,000 fighting the case. Inspectors have been carrying out weekly visits to the site and said over Christmas there were 43 caravans present. Mr Oldfield said: 'We are so frustrated with the legal system that is allowing this to continue. When we had to tell the residents they were distraught. We now have to face yet another legal process and it is so frustrating. 'We were told by the High Court that there was no possibility of further appeal but they have found a loophole and the Supreme Court is now considering a possible appeal. 'We have been advised that any action we take would be unsafe until everything has resolved itself. Gypsy site: The camp, which shot up overnight in November 2009, is situated on the outskirts of Hardhorn, Lancashire . 'This is a fight that has taken more than four years and cost taxpayers more than £200,000. It has been out of our hands for three years. 'But now to hear that there are more delays is difficult to take. It is totally irrelevant that the people concerned are travellers. They have broken the law and set up a camp on the land. They are using expert lawyers to drag the situation on.' The saga began in November 2009 after a field in the village - which featured in BBC’s Gardeners World - was sold by a farmer to a travelling family from West Yorkshire. The group of 30 adults and 40 children - mainly from Irish and Scottish families - moved in and immediately began work laying foundations under outdoor spot lights. The council were later granted an injunction banning the travellers from bringing more caravans onto the land. In 2010, the site was given a postcode after the travellers applied to the court saying they needed it to help fire and ambulance crews find them in an emergency. The ruling also meant they could apply for state benefits, plus utilities including gas electricity and water. Gypsy site: The group were supposed to leave by today but have stayed put while they wait to see whether the Supreme Court will consider their case . The travellers then applied for planning permission to stay on the fields for good and proposed to install further utility buildings, cesspools, fencing and hardstandings. Fylde Council refused the group retrospective planning permission and issued an enforcement notice instead demanding that they move off the site. An inspector at a planning inquiry also ruled that they had to leave. The group were given until last July to quit - but lodged an appeal at the last moment. In October Lord Justice Richards, sitting in the Court of Appeal, ruled the visual impact on the previously unspoilt landscape, road safety concerns and the site’s large scale compared to the nearby village, outweighed the group’s pressing need for a stable home. He ruled no further appeals could be heard. But on November 5 the travellers asked for permission to take their case to the Supreme Court. The court does not recovene until January 13. Members of the gypsy group have said they have been given 'no option' but to keep fighting. In a statement Terry Kelly said: 'We will stay until the bitter end. The council is saying we have to leave but they have offered us nowhere else to go. 'There’s a lot of kids and elderly people but none of that has been taken into consideration.'","Gypsies moved on to site in 'military-style' operation overnight four years ago - after council offices had closed for the weekend .

A teenage boy who suffered horrific 60 per cent burns when a fire ripped through his family's home has fought back after defying doctors' predictions. Nathaniel Smith is now a healthy 13-year-old after undergoing countless skin graft operations over the last seven-and-a-half years. The schoolboy's parents Marika and Chris were warned that he could die within hours after the fire in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, in May 2006. Back to health: Nathaniel Smith, 13, who defied doctors predictions after suffering 60 per cent burns seven-and-a-half years ago. He is pictured here with his mother Marika . He is now near the top of the class in school, and planning to take his A-levels in the future - despite being forced to miss classes in the past because of his condition. Nathaniel has now gone almost two years without a skin graft operation. Speaking for the first time about the blaze, he said: 'I think about how I could have died and how I am very lucky but I do not let anything hold me back. 'No one has ever said anything bad to me about it so I have had a lot of support from people and that's helped me. 'I just want to be like every other teenager out there.' Courage: Nathaniel Smith said: 'I just want to be like any other teenager out there' as he spoke publicly for the first time following his accident . Injuries: Nathaniel, 13, has endured countless operations since the fire in his home in May 2006 . Bravery: The 13-year-old has been supported by his parents Marika and Chris and siblings Corrina, 18, and Andre, 16, as he made his recovery . Nathaniel, now a year 9 pupil in Gateshead, spent months in a specialist burns unit while doctors fought to save his life following the accidental fire caused by a candle. His parents Marika and Chris and siblings Corrina, 18, and Andre, 16, have supported him as he made his recovery. His mother, 48, said: 'That first night when I said ""what's the prognosis?"" they said he could last two hours, two days, two weeks or two months, anything could happen. 'Throughout that following year when he was in hospital we would think he was getting better then he would get another infection and would be life-threateningly ill. 'I remember saying to a doctor, ""Will he be all right?"", and the doctor just said, ""I don't know, he might not be. It seems he is healing but he is not out of the woods"". Fightback: Nathaniel, six, photographed in the weeks after he suffered 60 per cent burns in the fire . Proud: Nathaniel's mother Marika hugs her son in their home when he was aged seven - just months after suffering severe burns . 'It used to be we would take one step forward then two back, it was just a roller coaster.' Since the fire the family have lost count of the number of operations Nathaniel has had to endure, and his battle is not over yet. 'Because the operations were so intense the doctors decided it would only be over the next couple of years if it was essential,' said Marika, who admitted she still gets flashbacks to the night of the fire. 'More operations are in the pipeline as and when he needs them. He has a lot of operations still to come and he needs his nose rebuilding, reconstructive surgery.' Blaze: The fire in the family's home in Gateshead was started by a candle accidentally in May 2006 . Fighter: Nathaniel attends Disney on Ice at Disney World in 2007 after defying doctors' predictions . Schoolboy: Nathaniel Smith meets one of his heroes, Rey Mysterio, WWE fighter ahead of a wrestling show at Metro Radio Arena, in Newcastle . But looking at her son today Marika said she can not believe how far he has come. 'I did not think we would see him get to this age because of the injuries, you could never see that far into the future, you could not imagine what years down the line would be like,' she said. 'If someone told me seven years ago he would be fine and doing really well at school I do not know what I would have thought,' added Marika, of Low Fell in Gateshead. Nathaniel has been doing particularly well in science, she said. Honoured: Nathaniel meets former Prime Minister Gordon Brown and his wife Sarah outside No 10 after he was nominated for a Child of Courage award . PC Smith: Nathaniel became a policeman for the day during his recovery from his injuries . Paying tribute to her son's strength of character Marika added: 'He has never once said, ""Why me?"", he does not feel sorry for himself or want special treatment, he wants to be a normal 13-year-old boy. He sees himself as a typical teenager who happens to have been in a fire.' And Nathaniel does not let his past stop him doing anything. Last summer he travelled to Mexico with a school friend and his family despite having to take extra precautions exposing his burns to the high temperature. He also enjoys playing basketball and being active just like his friends. Marika credits her son for his determination to get better after the fire and his desire for a normal life for how happy he is now. 'It's great to see him as a teenager, not hooked up to a machine, doing what he should be doing. I never thought I would see him playing on the playground again,' she said. Taking time to thank those people who supported the family in the years following the fire, Marika added: 'It's a horrific thing that happened but it is not the end of the world, there's light at the end of the tunnel if you keep going and there's support and help. 'We have a great community and people in the region have been brilliant to us.'","Nathaniel Smith, 13, suffered 60% burns in the blaze in Gateshead in 2006 .

The first band of rain is due to arrive in western parts of the UK just after midday tomorrow, bringing more wet weather to Wales, which has been badly affected by storms and flooding already. It will then move eastwards, making way for a new weather system which will arrive on Wednesday, bringing wet weather to every part of the UK and falling as snow in Scotland and across some northern parts of England. Dead end: Roads like this one in Chertsey, Surrey, were underwater as rain hit the waterlogged countryside. There are more than 100 flood alerts in place . Cut off: A man helps a child cross floodwaters near Oxford (left) while nearby houses were reflected in floodwaters in the calm after the storm (right) Evacuated: Dozens of homes were vacated in Chertsey, Surrey, as the floodwaters rose from the burst banks of the River Thames.

Residents living along the banks of the Thames in Surrey have been told to expect more flooding this weekend as river levels continue to rise . Homeowners in Chertsey have taken to using boats an canoes to navigate some parts of the town after the Thames burst its banks on Wednesday night . That will spell out more misery for parts of Southern England where the Thames has already burst its banks, and across Wiltshire, Hampshire, Dorset, Somerset and the Midlands where rivers are continuing to rise. The Environment Agency has said those . living along the lower reaches of the Thames in Surrey should remain . prepared for further flooding this weekend as water levels continue to . rise. It said in a . statement: 'There is also an ongoing risk of flooding from the Rivers . Parret in Somerset and the Severn in the Midlands. 'High groundwater levels mean we are . likely to see continued flooding in areas such as the Somerset levels . and moors, Dorset and Wiltshire.' Dozens of people have been evacuated from the town which has been swamped by floodwater as forecasters predict more rain tomorrow . But it added that water levels on the Thames between Lechlade, Gloucestershire, and Reading in Berkshire were beginning to slowly recede - while between Reading and Maidenhead they were stabilising. However, between Windsor and Chertsey in Surrey levels are still rising, albeit very slowly. The Thames is expected to stop rising in all parts within the next 24 hours, but it may be some days before the levels are back to normal, it said. EA teams are continuing to be out in force clearing watercourses, checking and operating mobile defences, issuing warnings, and helping communities with flooding. The most recent estimates suggest that more than 700 properties have been flooded since the start of the year, but more than 239,000 properties have been protected by flood defences. Craig Woolhouse, head of flood incident management, said: 'The River Thames is continuing to respond to the recent rainfall. 'Communities along the River Thames in Surrey should remain prepared for further flooding. 'River levels will remain high for the next few days and we urge people keep up to date with the latest flood warnings and take action. 'With so much standing water around, we would also remind people to stay out of flood water and not attempt to walk or drive through it.' The most recent estimates suggest that more than 700 properties have been flooded since the start of the year, but more than 239,000 properties have been protected by flood defences. Helen Roberts, a forecaster for the Met Office, said: 'The first band of weather will be pushing though later in the day tomorrow, though this one probably is not going to be heavy or last long so it won't cause too many problems. 'It will be pushing in from the west early to mid afternoon while Eastern parts of the UK the rain won't arrive until after dark. 'There may also be a spell of rain overnight Monday and into Tuesday but it is not looking threatening. 'The latter part of next week, Wednesday and into Thursday, there will be a western front pushing in that will be hanging around for quite a long time. 'The west coast from Scotland to Cornwall will be affected early on Wednesday, while the whole country can expect some wet weather during the course of the day. 'The rain could move away early on Friday morning but it is difficult to predict and it could be around for longer.' There are currently eighty six flood warnings in place across the UK, with 122 flood alerts, although none have been deemed severe - meaning flooding could lead to a loss of life. Eight people have died and more than 1,700 homes and businesses have been flooded in England since the beginning of the Christmas period, with around 550 properties flooded since the new year. Some 140 properties have been flooded in Wales. Today it appeared the atrocious weather had claimed another victim after the body of a missing photography student was found. Harry Martin, 18, left his home in Newton Ferrers, Devon, at noon on January 2 to go out to take pictures of stormy seas. Showers are predicted tomorrow and Monday in Wales which has already been badly affected by storms, while things settle down on Tuesday before more rain arrives on Wednesday .

A giant drone with the wingspan of a Boeing 757 commercial airliner is set to give the U.S. Navy the edge when it comes to spying. The Triton drone has completed its ninth flight trial to prove its ability to operate at a range of altitudes, speeds and weights. The drone could take to the skies in a few years and is designed to fly at high altitudes to provide surveillance and intelligence in realtime. A fleet of giant military drones called Tritons (pictured) with a wingspan the size of a commercial airliner are set to take to the skies in just a few years after successful tests . Triton boasts a wingspan of 130 feet and a collection of sensors, which gives its operators a 360 degree view that stretches for 2,000 nautical miles. It has been been developed by the U.S. Navy and Northrop Grumman, which claims the drone will let reconnaissance specialists monitor targets from a greater height and at a further distance then other drones. The unmanned aircraft can dip below clouds to get a closer look at a site and can also automatically identify ships. Operators will be able to control the craft’s radar and high-resolution cameras to zone in on new targets and share the information rapidly with other military units. The company believes the drone could be used to support military missions on the ground around the clock in as early as 2017. The wing structure of the drone was put through structural strength tests in late August by engineers. They successfully demonstrated the wing is 22 per cent stronger than the U.S. Navy's requirement in their lab (pictured) Should the drone drift from its programmed flight path because of turbulence, it can get back on course without intervention - a skill which it as demonstrated in a recent test flight. Triton has been tested in nine flights of over nine hours at altitudes of 50,000 feet in Palmdale, California. The structural strength of its wings has also been tested in a vast lab as the craft will swoop from high altitudes to get a closer look at targets as part of its missions. ‘A team of engineers found that no failures or unacceptable deformations of the wing occurred when it was subjected to a load at 22 per cent above the Navy's requirement,’ according to a company spokesman. The Triton drone has the wingspan of a Boeing 757 commercial airliner (pictured) and is set to give the U.S. Navy the edge when it comes to spying . Mike Mackey, Triton UAS programme director at Northrop Gumman, said: ‘During surveillance missions using Triton, Navy operators may spot a target of interest and order the aircraft to a lower altitude to make positive identification.’ ‘The wing’s strength allows the aircraft to safely descend, sometimes through weather patterns, to complete this manoeuvre.’ The U.S. Navy has ordered 68 of the MQ-4C Triton drones and they are expected to take to the skies on real missions in 2017. The unmanned aircraft (pictured on a test flight) can dip below clouds to get a closer look at a site and can also automatically identify ships. Military operators will be able to control the craft's radar and high-resolution cameras to zone in on new targets and share the information rapidly with other military units . Drones that can choose to deviate from a set mission and hunt in . ‘swarms’ could be patrolling skies within the next 25 years, according . to a new roadmap. Unmanned aircraft carrying strong chemical . weapons could also be on the horizon, the U.S. Department of Defence . (DoD) revealed in its Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap. Current . drones require intensive manpower on the ground to fly, which is . expensive and the DoD plans on cutting costs by letting the machines . make more decisions themselves, Live Science reported. The roadmap . also features plans for deadly ‘swarms’ of drone-bombs that are launched . from an unmanned ‘mothership’ to circle the skies while a human . operator searches for targets for the drones to crash into, guided by . the bots’ on-bard cameras. Thanks to the unmanned mothership, the kamikaze drones could have a range of over 250 nautical miles (463km) the roadmap said. The . weapons dropped by more traditional drones are also set to get more . deadly under the plans, as researchers are working on ‘energetic . nanoparticles’ with a larger surface areas so that the chemicals within . the ammunition reach faster and create a more powerful explosion.

Charles Saatchi booked a suite in the Savoy under a pseudonym and even smuggled a kitten into another hotel as he tried to impress Nigella Lawson while her first husband was dying, it was claimed today. Mr Saatchi even ordered his chauffeur to buy cat litter during their stay at the Berkeley Hotel so the television cook could look after the kitten while they were together, according to the claims. The pair would then go on chauffeur-driven shopping trips together to Harvey Nichols and Selfridges. Team Nigella has fiercely denied claims that she started dating the advertising tycoon before John Diamond died in March 2001. Scroll down for video . First husband: Nigella Lawson with John Diamond who died from throat cancer in 2001. Two years later she married Charles Saatchi . However, sources close to Miss Lawson, 53, said that journalist Mr Diamond was well aware that the cook and Mr Saatchi were spending time together. He gave his blessing because he wanted his children to have a father figure. Former chauffeur John Payne, 67, told The Sun that he booked a hotel for his boss Mr Saatchi and the TV cook under a pseudonym around six months before her husband died. During the three-night stay, Mr Saatchi took the TV cook to lunch at San Lorenzo restaurant in Knightsbridge, central London, where Princess Diana used to dine. A typical stay at the Savoy Hotel, The Strand, London, costs just under Â£500 a night with breakfast. Mr Payne told Wendy Leigh at the newspaper: 'I booked the Savoy Hotel suite where Nigella and Charles spent three days while seeing her in the autumn of 2000, while John Diamond was still alive. 'Charles told me ""I'm falling in love with her"", and asked me to book the Savoy Hotel suite under one of his pseudonyms, Nightingale or Green.' When the couple stayed at the Berkeley Hotel the chauffeur was sent to buy Pearls Cat Litter so that Nigella could smuggle in her kitten. Second husband: Miss Lawson married Charles Saatchi in May 2003. Team Nigella have denied claims from Mr Saatchi that they started dating around six months before her first husband John Diamond died . He later took them on shopping trips in central London to Selfridges and Harvey Nichols. After the trips, he would drop her off at her home in Shepherds Bush, before driving Mr Saatchi home. Miss Lawson married Mr Saatchi in his west London home in May 2003 two years after Mr Diamond died. The couple had their trusted aides Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo acting as witnesses as they tied the knot - a decade before they would accuse them of fraud. Mr Payne said that he first drove Miss Lawson in 1999 two years before her husband died from cancer. He picked her up in Mr Saatchi's white Chevrolet Caprice and drove her around while she shopped - before later dropping her off at the home she shared with Mr Diamond in Shepherds Bush, west London. Exclusive: The Savoy Hotel (left) and the Berkeley Hotel (right), both in central London, which Mr Saatchi stayed in with Miss Lawson before the death of her first husband in 2001, according to the millionaire art dealer's former chauffeur . When she gave evidence in court last month, Miss Lawson said she only 'became involved' with Mr Saatchi after her first husband passed away. 'It would be fair to say that not very long after my first husband died I began to become involved with Mr Saatchi,' she told the jury at Isleworth Crown Court. However, the 70-year-old millionaire told the Daily Mail in a statement: 'Nigella and I began our relationship . during the last six months of her husband John Diamond's life, rather . than after his death as she [Nigella] stated in court. 'Looking back at that time, I very deeply regret that this . betrayal of John occurred.' The timing of this 'confession' infuriated Nigella's friends, who described it as a 'wicked attempt to . smear her'. Miss Lawson and Mr Diamond had married in Venice in 1992 and they later had two children together before he was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1997. Mr Payne said that Mr Diamond came out of the house to have a look at the car. He added: 'When we got there, Nigella called John and said ""Come and look at this car, come and look at it!"" 'So he did, we had a chat, and he was very nice, But Charles never asked me to chauffeur him anywhere.' Mr Saatchi . and John Diamond had met over gambling games of Scrabble above a restaurant . in Knightsbridge and eventually the journalist brought Saatchi home to . meet his wife. At the time Saatchi was still married to his second wife Kay, mother of his only child Phoebe, 19. Mr Payne, a grandfather-of-three, said that he was later told to run errands for Miss Lawson - and was often asked to drop gifts for her off at his home.","Charles Saatchi booked Savoy suite six months before John Diamond died .

Secret mission: Dillwyn Thomas, 88, was given instructions 'to blow Port Talbot to smithereens' during World War II if the Germans ever invaded . A sheep farmer had top secret orders to blow his hometown 'to smithereens' during World War II if the Nazis had invaded, he revealed for the first time today. Dillwyn Thomas, 88, was given instructions on how to start a suicide guerrilla war in the hills around Port Talbot, South Wales. The pensioner was part of a covert army unit created by Winston Churchill known as the Auxiliary Units. They were spread across the country in a . network of local groups tasked with mounting a resistance . against the invaders who never came. Dillwyn was working as an 18-year-old farm hand when he was shown how to blow the town's steelworks 'sky high'. The pensioner, from Margam, near Port Talbot, has finally revealed the secret mission he was asked to carry out more than 70 years ago. He said: 'We were told to blow-up the steelworks - we were told to blow Port Talbot to smithereens. 'We had access to every weapon you could imagine - daggers for prodding the enemy, guns for shooting the enemy, explosives for blowing up the enemy. 'They were kept in a secret underground bunker that only we knew about - ready for us in case of invasion. 'If the Germans had landed and it looked as though they were making inroads we were to blow the steel works, oil refinery, train line, and anything else which could have been of any use to them - then lay low in the countryside. 'We weren’t meant to fight the Germans head-on - there were nowhere near enough of us to make a difference and we weren’t sufficiently armed. 'But if we could slow up their progress, then the hope was that we could tie them up with ambushes and booby traps. 'Of course I’m delighted that it never came to that but I must admit that there’s a tiny part of me which is disappointed that I never got to test my training in battle.' The Margam Auxiliary Unit was among a network of strategically placed, highly trained fighting groups dotted across the country, tasked with resisting German invasion. With Port Talbot’s Margam Castle identified as a potential headquarters for German troops, Dillwyn and his fellow unit members were briefed with mounting a final resistance. Farmer: Mr Thomas, pictured here in 1952, was an 18-year-old farm hand when he was tasked with blowing up railway lines and the steelworks during the war if the Germans ever came . Secret mission: This is the Margam bunker where the Auxilliary Unit's ammunition was stashed during World War II . From 1940 Auxiliary Units consisted of between four and eight men, usually recruited from the most able members of the Home Guard, who also had an excellent local knowledge and the ability to live off the land. Like 3,500 others, Dillwyn was trained on weekend courses at Coleshill House near Highworth, Wiltshire, in the arts of guerrilla warfare including assassination, unarmed combat, demolition and sabotage. War effort: Mr Thomas was told to destroy the steel mill in Port Talbot and anything else that would be useful to the Germans as part of a guerrilla insurgency . War effort: Dillwyn, pictured here as a 17-year-old, was art of a covert army unit created by Winston Churchill known as the Auxiliary Units . Dillwyn, who still farms in the area, said: 'The next thing I knew I was signing the Official Secrets Act, alongside five other local lads, who all worked on the Margam estate. 'We had no day-to-day tasks, we simply carried on as normal, but on a Sunday we would be taken under cover of darkness to a secret location and briefed.' For decades after the war Dillwyn didn’t reveal his secret role - not even to his family. He said: 'Nobody ever asked questions, not even my parents at the time. 'After the war was over we were never officially stepped down or told that our roles were over - we just sort of assumed they were and got on with life. 'I was friendly with the five others lads in the unit for years afterwards but we never spoke about our role during the war. 'Unfortunately, I am the only one of us still alive.' Dillwyn said he got so used to keeping secrets that he didn’t tell his family about what he had done for another 30 years. Now he has finally revealed his part in the secret war by writing a book called A View From the Main Ring. Dillwyn said: 'Looking back now, the job we were given was one of huge responsibility, but as a young dimwit I never understood or appreciated the magnitude of what we were asked to do. 'I am just thankful that it never came to that, and can only pray to God that we are never forced into such a position again.'

Three lapdancers and their manager kidnapped a club boss after he failed to pay them more than £42,000, a court has been told. The women had been hired to work at a pop-up nightclub to provide entertainment for customers during the Cheltenham Festival in March 2012. Curtis Woodman, who had set up the club was driven to a . remote field and beaten up, it was claimed. Three lapdancers and their agent Charlotte Devaney, 34, are alleged to have enlisted the help of two male friends to strongarm him. 'Kidnappers': Lapdancers Stephanie Pye, 31, and Mandy Cool, 29, who are accused of kidnapping Curtis Woodman after claiming they had not been paid . A court heard that Mr Woodman, 34, . hired the girls around the time of the festival but fell out with them when he accused them of breaching . the Embassy Club's strict licence conditions by stripping off. Bristol Crown Court heard the club failed . to secure a lapdancing licence and the girls signed contracts agreeing . they would wear 'bikinis and nipple tassels at all times'. But when the club opened some of the . women, who were paid £150 per night to work there, 'insisted on taking . their clothes off' and it was shut down by officials. The . women claimed they were promised 50 per cent of any card takings . which included £42,000 spent by one excited punter. In a taped police interview played to the jury, Mr Woodman said that he struggled to get the women to keep their clothes on. 'A lot of the girls earned a lot of money from working that Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.' Mr . Woodman said the problem between him and the girls arose on the Tuesday . night, when a customer began spending money on his debit card. 'He was obviously a big spender, he was spending a lot of money, I mean in the region of £40,000. 'Throughout . all of the week, we had just one night which was a full nude lapdancing . night, the rest of the nights were running as a hostess business fully . clothed. Accused: Agent Charlotte Devaney, 34, (left) and lapdancer Rachel Goodchild, 24, (right) who are both also accused of kidnap and standing trial at Bristol Crown Court . 'If you have ever asked a stripper to keep her clothes on when she is working, it doesn’t happen. 'I was constantly bombarding them ‘put your clothes back on we are going to get shut down’. 'You . try and keep 60 girls in check. On the Wednesday we had a team meeting . before we started, we told the girls to go into town and buy clothes. Devaney . spent months chasing Mr Woodman for the 'debt' before visiting a police . station in Cheltenham on September 3, where she was advised to take . civil action. Later that . day, Devaney, along with dancers Mandy Cool, 29, Stephanie Pye, 31, and . Rachel Goodchild, 24, met with brothers Alexander, 23, and Robert . Morris, 27. Radio 1 DJ Fabio arrives at Bristol Crown Court in support of one of the woman accused of kidnap . The group headed to Mr . Woodman's work in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, in two cars, where they . 'kidnapped him', the jury of seven men and five women was told. Prosecuting, Martin Steen said: 'Miss Devaney made clear she thought that there would need to be a discussion with Mr Woodman. 'He was helped into Miss Devaney's car by the Morrises, who sat either side of him in the back of the vehicle. 'Mr Woodman was wearing a Breitling watch. It was seen by the Morrises and he was required to hand it over. 'They . had in their possession a Stanley knife. He was under threat. He had no . choice but to hand over that watch, worth £4,800, and he did so.' Mr Steen said that when Alexander Morris was later arrested, the watch was found to be in his possession. During the drive, Mr Woodman was sat in Devaney's BMW One Series with her, the Morris brothers and Stephanie Pye. Cool, in her BMW Three Series, with Goodchild, followed. Mr Woodman was allegedly struck twice in the face by Robert Morris as the car drove onto the M5 and left at junction 10. His phone was confiscated and attempts were made to transfer money using a banking app, which were unsuccessful, Mr Steen said. 'He was then persuaded to ring the bank and arrange for a transfer using the details of Charlotte Devaney's bank card,' he told the jury. '£4,800 was transferred into Charlotte Devaney's account.' Mr Woodman was then taken 100 metres down an agricultural track, where he was taken out of the vehicle by the Morris brothers, it was alleged. 'They told him they were going to have some fun,' Mr Steen said. 'That involved hitting him to the face and kicking him to the face, causing him to bleed. 'It was suggested that they should pay a visit to his parents, perhaps dealing with his parents might encourage satisfaction of the debt that was owed.' Mr Woodman directed the vehicles to an empty property he claimed was his home - stating he had left the keys in his office - before the cars set off again. He was then driven to a fish and chip shop and left him in the car, Mr Steen said. 'Mr Woodman was later released with threats that if he didn't pay the rest of the money, they would be back,' Mr Steen said. Police had already been tipped off because Mr Woodman rung a business partner during the drive and they were able to trace the two BMWs. Nightclub: The women were performing at a 'pop up' lapdancing club called the Embassy (pictured) in Cheltenham during the horse-racing festival . The Morris brothers, Cool and Goodchild were arrested when Cool's BMW was stopped on the A34 in Hampshire at 8.30pm that evening. Devaney was arrested at an address the following day, while Pye handed herself into a police station later. Mr Steen said Devaney and the girls hatched a plan to kidnap Mr Woodman after months of chasing him for payment. 'As far as the girls were concerned, they were hoping to have their share of the credit card payment of £42,000,' Mr Steen said. 'Mr Woodman felt that the girls had broken their contracts and were not entitled to keep the money.' Mr Steen explained the entertainment licence the club had meant the women were not allowed to provide lapdancing or stripping services, save for one day of the month. 'The contracts stated that clothes - bikinis and nipple tassels - were to be worn at all times,' Mr Steen said. 'On the Monday night, some of the girls would not adhere to the rules, they insisted on taking their clothes off. Complaints came to be made.' On the Tuesday night, during which the £42,000 transaction was made, the club held the permitted one day of 'full entertainment', including stripping services, he said. 'On the Wednesday, police and licensing officers paid the club a visit,' he said. 'The girls were not adhering to the rules. As a result, the club was closed down.' Earlier, Alexander Morris, from Southampton, admitted carrying a bladed article, namely a Stanley knife, on September 3, 2012, the day of the alleged kidnap. Morris and his brother Robert, also from Southampton deny robbery of Mr Woodman's Brietling watch. The pair are also charged with the robbery of £60 cash Mr Woodman is alleged to have given them the day before his release. Devaney, from London; Pye, from Sutton Coldfield; Cool, of Southampton; and Goodchild, of Southampton, each deny a charge of kidnap on September 3 2012. The trial, in front of judge Geoffrey Mercer, continues.","Curtis Woodman 'failed to pay three lapdancers he recruited'

'You start to trust them when you're a young kid, and he started to take me for a few private sessions because he said I was good and I could do with some extra sessions because that would really help. 'He took me into a private situation where no one else was... and then he abused my trust, and he abused the fact that I was an innocent person who wanted his support and his compassion and his care as my running coach.'

'Stabbing': Jacqueline Warren, 52, was rushed to hospital after apparently being stabbed in her home . An 80-year-old man has been charged with the attempted murder by police investigating the stabbing of his daughter who had spent two years researching their family tree. Harry Warren was arrested after mother-of-four Jacqueline Warren, 52, was knifed several times at the house they shared in Rochdale, Greater Manchester. Ms Warren, a former barmaid was airlifted to Wythenshawe Hospital by air ambulance and underwent emergency treatment for stab injuries. She is said to be in a serious but stable condition. The incident at breakfast time on Monday occurred just 48 hours after divorcee Jacqui, who had lived in the area for 20 years, posted messages on Facebook proudly talking of her work on her family tree. During her research she had managed to reunite long lost relatives including a mother who had given up her daughter for adoption and a father and child who had not seen each other for ten years. It is believed Jacqui's father moved in with her around six months ago after struggling with his advancing age. Today Warren was due to appear before Rochdale Magistrates' Court after being questioned by detectives. One neighbour said: 'It's such a shock. Jacqui's a lovely neighbour who would do anything for anybody and she absolutely adores her family. 'She even helped me out a few times with household chores. Her father is as quiet as a mouse and we barely saw him. 'We believe he he had been struggling with advancing age and she was just helping him out. He'd only been living there about six months. We're just hoping and praying Jacqui will pull through. She is a genuinely good and caring person.' Another said: 'I was speaking to Jacqui's daughter who said she was seriously ill but the family think she'll a be alright. The first I knew about it was when I heard the helicopter. It was right over the house. 'Attack': Police were called to this home in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, after reports that a woman had been stabbed . 'Attack': Mother-of-four Jacqueline Warren, 52, who had recently been researching her family tree . 'They were trying to land on the green opposite but they couldn't because of the trees and overhead lines and had to land on a nearby road. The police cordoned off drive and put up a scenes of crime tent. There must have been six or seven police cars outside.' Jacqui has two daughters and two sons and is believed to have grandchildren herself. She had been looking forward to becoming a godparent to a newborn baby. In a message on Facebook on January 4 she said: 'I'm so glad that I can bring some joy and happiness into people's lives. 'I've found someone's mother as she was adopted at birth and they were both overjoyed to be reunited and I've just found someone's daughter he's not seen for 10 years. 'Happy days spring to mind. I've been doing my family tree for about two years now so if i can help anyone feel free to message me.' A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said they were called to the property shortly after 8.30am on Monday morning. They said they found a woman at the scene with a 'number of stab wounds'. The victim's father was taken into custody. Detective Inspector Melani Linton of Greater Manchester Police said: 'People are bound to be extremely shocked when they hear news of this incident, but I would like to try and reassure them as much as I can. 'We have a team of detectives investigating what exactly has happened here. This was an isolated incident and we do not believe there was any threat to the wider community.'","Harry Warren 'repeatedly stabbed his daughter Jacqueline Warren'

A teenager was stabbed in a 'senseless and tragic' attack after stepping in to protect a friend at a house party advertised on Facebook, a court has heard. Jay Whiston, 17, from Clacton, Essex, died of a stab wound to the heart after trouble broke out at the house party in Colchester on September 8, 2012. Edward Redman, 18, from Colchester, who is accused of stabbing the teenager to death, denies murder. Jay Whiston died from a stab wound to the chest after trouble broke out at a house party in a quiet residential area in Colchester on September 8, 2012 . Floral tributes were placed outside the house in Colchester after Jay Whiston died from a stab wound following a dispute at a house party . Chelmsford Crown Court heard today how Jay stumbled to a neighbouring house after sustaining the stab wound at the party, which was held in a quiet residential street and attended by around 100 people. The jury of seven men and five women heard how Redman demanded partygoers gave him alcohol they had brought which they refused, prompting Redman . to punch one of Jay’s friends. Prosecutor Mark Milliken-Smith QC told the court: 'It would appear Jay Whiston stepped in and pushed Redman back saying ""we don’t want trouble"" - but Redman clearly did.' The court then heard how Redman launched into a vicious attack which . only ended when Jay slumped to the floor before staggering next door . for help. Redman and a group of his friends followed Jay, and the defendant was allegedly heard to say: 'I’m going to do him in.' The . court heard how Redman’s friend launched a glass bottle at Jay before . Redman stabbed him again as the attack spilled out into the street. Redman fled the scene as Jay collapsed and was rushed to hospital where he was pronounced dead at 10.57pm.

Caroline Shearer, Jay's mother, attended the start of the trial with his sister Holly Fairburn today. Caroline appeared visibly upset in the public gallery as evidence was given . A post-mortem revealed Jay suffered two puncture wounds, one to the abdomen and a fatal blow to the upper chest. His family packed the public gallery at Chelmsford Crown Court today as the trial got underway. His . mother, Caroline Shearer, was visibly moved as she heard the harrowing . evidence of what happened on the night of her son’s tragic death. Edward . Redman appeared in the dock today with his father, Gary Redman, 51, and his . brother, John Redman, 19, both from Colchester, Essex, who are both . charged with conspiring to pervert the course of justice. The charge relates to evidence which has never been recovered and was allegedly destroyed soon after the party. The family of Jay Whitson attended the Chelmsford Crown Court today for the start of the trial. Jay's dad, Stafford, left, is seen arriving at the court with Jay's step-mother Debbie, far right . Redman’s former girlfriend Shannon Fenlon, 19, from Clacton, is also charged with conspiring to pervert the course of justice. All three deny the charges but the jury was told all three defendants accused of perverting the course of justice made a . concerted effort to ensure that any significant evidence linking Redman . to the murder was destroyed. The court heard that Redman went to his girlfriend's house immediately after the party to 'distance himself from what he had done and to distance himself from the police'. Mr Milliken-Smith told the jury that when Redman's mother went to collect him the next day he told her he had been in a fight with 'pushing and shoving'. Redman's mother noticed he was not wearing the same clothing he had been wearing and noticed a 'bonfire smell' when he got into the car, jurors were told. Mr Milliken-Smith said that after the incident 'social media was understandably abuzz'. Jay Whiston's dad, Stafford Whiston, above, attended Chelmsford Crown Court today as the trial into his son's death got underway. Edward Redman, 18, from Colchester is accused of stabbing Jay, 17, but denies murder . The jury was told that via messaging, Redman was asked by someone if he stabbed Mr Whiston, to which he replied: 'Yeah, I did.' When asked why he carried out such an act, the jury heard that he replied: 'I didn't mean to.' Mr Milliken-Smith said Redman then claimed a fight broke out because they were all drunk. The jury was told about how Redman went to a girl's house after she was visited by police and said he wanted to know what she told them. Mr Milliken-Smith said he was, at least in part, 'creating an air of intimidation', should anyone say anything against him. The prosecutor told the court that his former girlfriend Fenlon was at a different party that night and said that when she got off the phone from Redman, friends said she had 'gone completely white'. She told them her boyfriend had been in a fight and was in trouble and needed to get out of Colchester, the court heard. Addressing the jury, Mr Milliken-Smith said: 'You all need to ask yourselves how he knew there was a stabbing.' He also said . the case 'demonstrates the senseless and tragic taking of a young life, . so full of promise'. 'It’s . another desperate example of the catastrophe and heartbreak brought . about by the indiscriminate and cowardly use of knives. 'If any more . evidence was needed that knife crime was prevalent, the events didn’t . take place in a gang-overrun inner city estate but at a party staged at a . house in suburban Colchester.'

In court: Constance Briscoe, who is accused of perverting the course of justice by lying to police about how she helped friend Vicky Pryce expose her ex-husband Chris Huhne . Britain's top black female judge plotted to bring down Chris Huhne by lying to police about the speeding points scandal, a court heard yesterday. Constance Briscoe, 56, was said to be ‘determined to go for the kill’ after the then Cabinet Minister denied making his ex-wife Vicky Pryce take speeding points on his behalf. The subsequent exposure of the points row led to Huhne’s resignation and prison terms for the former couple. Southwark Crown Court heard Briscoe repeatedly lied to police. She allegedly said that her Clapham neighbours Huhne and Pryce were ‘associates’ who she only saw at parties because their children were friends. But in reality the barrister and part-time judge ‘was quite intent’ on destroying Huhne, 59, and was in contact with journalists as early as 2010, just months after he and Pryce split, it was alleged. One journalist said at the time: ‘She is determined to go in for the kill. Unlike VP [Vicky Pryce], she is nicely out of the spotlight and just wants Huhne to get his “comeuppance” i.e. lose his position as Energy Secretary and be exposed as a liar.’ The Mail on Sunday was forced to disclose material showing it was in contact with Briscoe by a court order applied for by Huhne. Jurors heard that between May 2011 and October 2012, Briscoe made two ‘inaccurate and misleading’ signed witness statements. She then altered her statement to change its meaning on October 6, 2012, they heard. She faces a third charge of falsifying a document between October 2012 and October 2013 after she was charged with perverting the course of justice. Yesterday Briscoe, who has been suspended from the judiciary since her arrest in 2012, sat in the dock staring at the floor. Prosecutor Bobbie Cheema, QC, said: ‘Put very simply . . . Constance Briscoe helped a friend of hers, a woman called Vicky Pryce, to provide information to the media.’ Friend: Economist Vicky Pryce, who went to prison for taking speeding points for former husband Chris Huhne, is a friend of the lawyer - who was arrested in October 2012 . While this was not illegal, she said, . Briscoe is accused of ‘hiding what she was really up to when the police . asked her about it, giving the police misleading information and later . on trying to manipulate both the police and the court  during an . investigation into her, Miss Briscoe’s, own actions’. Huhne and Pryce were each jailed for eight months last year after it emerged Pryce had taken speeding points for Huhne in 2003. In . her police statement, Briscoe claimed that Pryce told her about the . incident in May 2003. She said: ‘She was absolutely furious . . . she . said that he had nominated her without her knowledge in a car which he . had been driving.’ Briscoe . said she told Pryce that Huhne should ‘come clean’, but Pryce said he . would probably lose his licence if he got more points. Jailed: Former British cabinet minister Chris Huhne was jailed in March for falsely telling police Pryce had been driving when his car was caught by a speed camera . The . jury heard Briscoe was due to be a prosecution witness in Huhne and . Pryce’s trial, but was deemed not to be a reliable or truthful  witness. Miss Cheema said: ‘She is a professional lawyer, indeed she is a . practising criminal barrister with dozens of years’ experience. ‘Despite . all her advantages . . . she was prepared to lie to police, she was . prepared to present an entirely false picture about her relationship . with Miss Pryce.’ She added . that the justice system relies ‘on lawyers having the utmost integrity . in all their dealings in the course of justice’. Briscoe denies three counts of perverting the course of justice. The trial continues.","Lawyer and judge Constance Briscoe, 56, accused of three counts of perverting the course of justice .

When it came to food trends in 2013, it was all about . pulled pork, meaty gourmet burgers, stylish meringues and brand new . innovations such as the Cronut. Now . some of Britain's leading food experts, including a Michelin starred . chef, supper club owner and street food expert have been bought together . by Warburtons, to predict what we'll be eating in 2014... Kale was the trendy superfood of 2013 but the new rising star will be buckwheat. A fruit seed, neither a wheat or grain, is a great alternative to cous cous and quinoa and is suitable for those who are gluten intolerant. It can be used to make healthy pancakes and waffles or as a substitute for rice in a risotto-style dish. Scroll down for video . On the menu: Buckwheat, used here to make pancakes, will become a trendy new superfood . Brit will follow the America's lead to become more experimental with their sandwich fillings . Research reveals that the UK alternative sandwich market (i.e filled snacks made from pittas, thins, wraps etc rather than slices of bread), has grown by 15 per cent in the past year. This trend is expected to continue in 2014 with people becoming more adventurous with their fillings. Helen Graves, author of 101 sandwiches, said: 'Experimenting with sandwich possibilities is going to be a huge trend next year in the UK, seeing sandwiches as something of a treat - more indulgent and with exciting ingredients.' She added that this trend started in the U.S and 'their love of the open sandwich'. Tom Sellers, the youngest chef to be awarded a Michelin star, agrees. He said: 'Like burgers in 2013, I think this year will be all about the sandwich. People have become fanatical about quality food that's easily accessible, modern and healthy and I feel that a freshly made sandwich is the perfect answer for this. A Tom Sellers sandwich would definitely include thickly sliced rare beef and plenty of horseradish.' Rejuvenated: Truffles will become more accessible . Truffles have always been a high end restaurant staple but in 2014 they'll be more accessible to the masses in the form of truffle crisps and truffle biscuits. Food futurologist, Morgaine Gaye, said the resurgence of truffles will come as part of a trend for foraging for food. She said: 'Rosehips, greengages, old fruits like damsons, gooseberries, foraging for food and more mushroom varieties are all going to be big. Truffles are definitely setto be this year's food hero, and it won't just be limited to specialty dishes.' In light of a lack of faith in the meat industry following the horse meat scandal, more people are going to be turning to vegetarian options. But not everyone will forgo meat altogether and a new tribe of 'flexitarians' will be born. Flexitarians will be happy to eat quality meat but equally at home in a restaurant offering only vegetarian options. From the growth of street food markets to supper clubs and new community food sites, 'secret spaces' is about being more adventurous when eating out and uncovering the new places to dine in your area. Sites like such as eatmyworld.com allow people to search for pop-up restaurants and supper clubs near to them. The 'at home chef' refers to people becoming more ambitious and experimental with their cooking. Access to professional tools and techniques such as curing and smoking meats as well as adopting techniques such as sous vide, will become popular as people look to emulate restaurant quality food in the comfort of their own home. They can even make money out of their talent thanks to websites such as Cookisto.co.uk where amateur chefs can advertise their meals for people in their surrounding area to buy. The service is an alternative to traditional takeaways for those who don't have the time to cook. Founder of Cookisto.co.uk, Michalis Gkandas, said: 'For me, 2014 will be the year of sharing and being able to incorporate people's love of cooking into a sustainable profession. Diners are becoming more food savvy than ever before and Cookisto gives diners the power to take bids fromchefs to ensure they get exactly what they are looking for and chefs the power to reach a growing engaged audience.'","Buckwheat will be new trendy superfood .

All of their children, Georgina, Stephen and Simon were aware of their father’s wishes and supported him, the hearing was told. The . couple had approached the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland to end their . lives, but were denied their wish because of the mental deterioration of . Mrs Arnold, a retired teacher who also suffered from Type 2 Diabetes. Recalling their final hours on July 13, 2012, Mrs Roberts said: ‘Dad had . said ‘mum seemed very lucid today.’ She . said her father maintained it was up to her mother when they would . finally die. She said it was important it was on her mother’s terms . because of her dementia. She . told how the couple talked on and off for hours that day, about acting . out the pact which they had agreed some five years earlier. ‘Mum . told me dad had talked to her. He had had enough and so had she. I knew . then this was going to be the hardest day of my life.’ Mrs . Roberts continued: ‘I asked if they were sure today was the day. They . said it was but they wanted to watch the Proms on TV first.’ She . mixed the drug her father had instructed her to buy over the internet . and another that would speed up its effect. ‘I put it in a cup on dad’s . bedside table and another cup next to mum. 'I said it would be bitter so . they should have a chocolate afterwards. I gave them a chocolate each. 'Dad then had a whisky and mum had a port, I think. They quickly slipped . in to a deep sleep. ‘I stood . there in stunned silence watching them. It was surreal. I went to the . kitchen and came back after about 30 minutes. 'I checked dad’s pulse and . he had gone. I checked mum and she was still there so I had to go back . out to the kitchen.’ Mrs Roberts told the coroner how, on her father's instructions, she bought drugs and stashed them away in the elderly couple's £400,000 bungalow in Newbury, Berkshire (pictured) Mrs . Roberts told how she then phoned her brother Stephen to break the news, . before calling 999. Her other brother Simon was informed an hour later. Previously . fit and active, Dr Arnold had developed the early stages of Parkinson’s . disease and was left bed-ridden after his right leg had to be amputated . in August 2011 because of a septicemic ulcer. Mrs Arnold had been diagnosed with mixed dementia in 2003. Prior to his own incapacitation, Dr Arnold had been her full-time carer for nine years.

A Phoenix woman already facing more than 40 charges – including first-degree murder – for her involvement in a 2013 kidnapping and standoff reportedly tried to have the witnesses killed. Bernadette Beanes, 20, has been in jail since the May incident made infamous when a SWAT vehicle actually plowed through the home she was barricaded inside, is accused of trying to hire a prison guard to kill four witnesses – including a nine-year-old child. The troubled woman offered $20,000 to an undercover officer pretending to be a hit man invited to the jail by the guard to make the deaths look like an accident, according to CBS 5. Ms Beanes was in jail because she helped then-boyfriend Israel Celis, 32, tie a woman up and sexually assault her in a hotel before kidnapping her three-year-old son, four other women, another man and two additional children, according to AZ Central. The ensuing standoff produced images burned into the memory of millions across the country – a massive armored SWAT vehicle barreling through the front of a Phoenix home multiple times to try to end the 12-hour hostage situation. Mr Celis committed suicide as cops closed in on the room he was holed up in with a woman and the nine-year-old boy – Ms Beanes is charged with first-degree murder because he died in a felony she’s accused of participating in, according to KPHO. Multiple law enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Marshal’s Service, brought the deadly standoff to a dramatic finish, according to AZ Central. First thought a victim: Ms Beanes was initially wheeled out of the home and treated like a victim . Smash!: Dust can be seen pouring from the spot where the armored truck rammed into the home where hostage were being held last year . If at first you don't succeed: The armored truck then slammed into a second part of the house . Massive presence: Snipers were even laid across a neighboring roof . Ms Beanes was notably wheeled out of the home on a stretcher and depicted on early television reports as one of the victims. It took officials less than 24 hours to piece together what had really happened and arrest her. She was charged with 38 counts of aggravated assault, eight counts of kidnapping and first-degree murder. News of her trying to hire a hitman is the latest chapter in one of the more bizarre criminal cases in Phoenix in recent memory – and one of her victims doesn’t even blame her. Safe at last: The nine-year-old boy targeted by Ms Beane's murder-for-hire plot (then eight-years-old) was shown being taken from the scene by his mother . All fixed up now: The home smashed up by the SWAT vehicle was quickly fixed up . ‘She seemed like a confused 19-year-old girl that got misled by the wrong bad boy,’ the victim who declined to be identified told CBS 5. When asked if facing her in court would do him any good, the man said no, ‘I don’t think she really knew what was going on when it happened.’ Authorities believe she certainly knew what she was doing when she reportedly tried to order four hits on witnesses to the standoff. A count of conspiracy to commit murder was added to her already lengthy litany of crimes, bringing the total number of charges to 48.","Bernadette Beans, 20, faces almost 50 criminal counts .

It's the butt of jokes and widely misunderstood, and yet, erectile dysfunction causes embarrassment and distress to more than two million British men. With creams and injections not always proving effective, more and more men are taking the plunge and turning to surgery to cure their bodily woes. But as Dan Metzgar, a 45-year-old lorry driver from Maryland, found out, surgery isn't without its risks. After having a penis pump, a common surgical solution for men with erectile dysfunction, inserted, he was left with a permanent erection. Upsetting: Dan Metzgar, 45, was left in agony when a penile pump operation was botched . 'It's very embarrassing to walk around . with an erection that won't go away, not to mention painful,' he reveals. 'Imagine . trying to stuff an erection into your pants and hide it all the time. I . was wearing baggy clothes and over-length shirts to try to hide it.' His problems began in 2006 when he began suffering from erectile problems and the catastrophic loss of confidence that resulted. 'I could see it was taking a toll on him because, you know, not feeling like a man,' Dan's wife Donna explains. 'He was in despair.' Recluse: Dan says being left with a permanent erection left him depressed and too upset to go out . Recluse: Dan says being left with a permanent erection left him depressed and too upset to go out . After a succession of creams and . pills failed to provide a cure, Dan and Donna decided to spend their . $42,000 life savings on surgery. 'Most . men with erection problems have an inability to get or maintain an . erection satisfactorarily to have sexual intercourse,' explains Gordon . Muir, a consultant urologist. '[A penile pump] has two little balloons which are . implanted into the penis, a small pump which lies in from of the scrotum . and a bag of saline which lies next to the bladder. 'When the patient . wants to have an erection, he simply squeezes the pump, and the . cylinders fill up with saline and become swollen and also quite rigid.' Dan hoped that the pump would prove the solution to his woes. Instead, the operation was the start of a year of misery. After an operation that should have taken one hour turned into four, Dan was forced to stay in hospital for an extra four days and returned home in agony. 'The pain every day was like something . stabbing me,' he remembers. 'It was like a screwdriver poking at the inside of the . scrotum, trying to break free. And it didn't go away - it didn't get . easier.' Solution: Properly inserted (as shown), a penile pump can permanently cure erectile dysfunction . Doctors told him the pain was caused by swelling, and told him it would go as the swelling went down. They were right, but no-one told him what to do about the erection that remained. 'I thought it was normal,' he confesses. 'I thought, if . that's the way they left me, then maybe that's how I was supposed to . heal. I thought when I went to the doctor, they would show me how to use . it.' He returned to his surgeon for advice, and left black and blue after the medic tried - and failed - to get the pump to work before telling him it was defective and another $10,000 operation was needed to remove it. Furious, Dan sought a second opinion and was horrified to discover that not only had the original surgeon botched the operation, 'it looked like they didn't know what they were doing.' 'I . decided to go and get another opinion, and he basically told me that . the first surgery was botched and whoever did it, didn't know what they . were doing.' Upsetting: Erectile dysfunction makes the lives of 2.3 million British and 30 million American men a misery . Possible solution: Some men turn to Viagra but pills and creams don't always work for everyone . But unable to afford an operation to remove the pump, Dan was forced to live with the erection for eight months, putting huge strain on family relationships and turning him into a virtual recluse. 'My son was embarrassed by me,' he says. 'He didn't . come around me for months. I was the guy with the erection - he didn't . want to be around me.' Worse was to come. The surgeon had bungled the original operation so badly, the tubing connected to the penile pump moved, eventually scissoring through his skin while Dan was enjoying a family holiday. 'By the time we got to the hotel room, . the rip in my scrotum had gone from top to bottom and all the tubing was . hanging out,' he remembers, adding: 'I was scared to death.' Rushed to hospital, Dan endured three operations to repair the damage and remove the pump but was left with what resembled an empty sack of skin. Desperate to be 'normal' again, he underwent one last operation, this time under the auspices of a respectable surgeon and had a new penile pump fitted, . 'I.. really, I didn't feel like a man at . all,' he remembers. 'How could you? So we decided that the only way I was going to be . normal was to get back what I'd lost.' Following his fifth operation, Dan was left with a fully-functioning penis, albeit one that is half the size of the original. He's sanguine about the loss of length. 'After all we've been through, I'm . grateful to have what I do have,' he adds. 'At least I can make love to my wife, . which is the main thing. 'I would just urge anybody to use caution before having any surgery. You might just get more than you bargained for.' Dan appears on Botched Up Bodies, tomorrow night at 10pm on Channel 5 .","Dan Metzgar, 45, from Maryland had a permanent erection for eight months .

Concerning: Kim Jong Un's vow to restart its mothballed nuclear facilities raises fears about assembly lines churning out fuel for a fearsome arsenal of nuclear missiles . North Korea's vow to restart its mothballed nuclear facilities raises fears about assembly lines churning out fuel for a fearsome arsenal of nuclear missiles. But it may actually be a sign that Pyongyang needs a lot more bomb fuel to back up its nuclear threats. Despite the bluster, it could be years before North Korea completes the laborious process of creating more weaponised fuel. Its announcement, experts say, is also likely an effort to boost fears meant to keep its leadership safe while trying to extract concessions from the U.S. and its allies. North Korea has declared itself a . nuclear power and threatened to expand its atomic arsenal after its . third nuclear test in February sparked the recent rise in hostility on . the Korean Peninsula. But that arsenal is estimated to be only a handful . of crude devices. To . assemble a cache of weapons that would make it a true nuclear power, . and to back up its threats, North Korean scientists need more bomb fuel - . both for the weapons they hope to build and for the repeated tests . required to perfect those weapons. 'Despite . its recent threats, North Korea does not yet have much of a nuclear . arsenal because it lacks fissile materials and has limited nuclear . testing experience,' Siegfried Hecker, a nuclear scientist who has been . regularly granted unusual access to the North's nuclear facilities, said . this week in answers posted to the website of Stanford University's . Center for International Security and Cooperation. North Korea nuclear capabilities are something of a mystery. What . is known is that it possesses the ability to produce both fuels that . can be used to make nuclear bombs - plutonium and uranium. This . causes serious long-term worries following North Korea's announcement . Tuesday that it is 'readjusting and restarting' all facilities at its . main Nyongbyon nuclear complex, including a plutonium reactor shut down . six years ago as part of now-failed nuclear negotiations, and a uranium . enrichment plant. Scroll down for video . Power: North Korea's spent nuclear fuel rods kept in a cooling pond are seen at the nuclear facilities in Yongbyon, North Korea in this 1996 file photo . It may also be a sign of frustration . from Pyongyang that weeks of posturing and threats haven't driven U.S. and South Korean negotiators back to nuclear disarmament-for-aid talks. 'What . they really want is a safety blanket and a blackmail tool,' Ralph . Cossa, president of the Pacific Forum CSIS think tank in Hawaii, said in . an email. The announcement 'is primarily . political, designed to signal strength and intimidate. It should not . necessarily be seen as a revelation about North Korea's capabilities and . true intent,' Greg Thielmann, a senior fellow at the Arms Control . Association in Washington, said in an email. A reactor at the main Nyongbyon nuclear complex could eventually make, in one year, enough plutonium to power one bomb. Examination: U.S. researchers visited North Korea in 2008 - researcher Siegfried Hecker examines machining lathes that were used for machining uranium metal fuel rods and are now stored in monitored storage locations in the fuel fabrication facility . Threats: The empty inner structure of a cooling tower at the Nyongbyon Nuclear Centre- North Korea vowed this week to restart a nuclear reactor that can make one bomb's worth of plutonium a year . Restarted: In 2008 file photo the cooling tower of the Yongbyon nuclear complex is demolished in a sign of its commitment to stop making plutonium for atomic bombs, but now it is being re-started . It was shuttered as part of . international disarmament talks in 2007, its cooling tower blown up in a . dramatic show of commitment to a now-scrapped nuclear deal. North Korea . shocked many when in 2010 it unveiled an industrial-scale uranium . enrichment facility, which gives it an alternative route to create . bombs. Estimates on restarting the vital . facilities at the plutonium reactor vary from three months to a year, . depending on the expert. North . Korea has already begun construction at the reactor and it could be . back in operation sooner than expected, according to a U.S. research . institute that analyzed recent commercial satellite imagery of . Nyongbyon. Rebuilding the cooling tower would . take six months, but a March 27 photo shows building work may have . started for an alternative cooling system that could take just weeks, . the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced . International Studies said Wednesday. North Korea today announced that it would kick-start its nuclear programme once again by re-opening a complex which was closed as part of disarmament talks six years ago. A file handout satellite image shows the Yongbyon complex nuclear facility . But . even if the reactor is now up and running, Cossa estimates it would be . two to three years before scientists could obtain more plutonium for . bombs. There are other challenges to restarting the reactor. North . Korean scientists need to clean, check for any leaks, test components . and replace ones that no longer work, according to No Hee-cheon, a . nuclear expert at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology . in Daejeon, South Korea. A map showing North Korea missile ranges. The Pentagon has announced it is deploying missile defense systems to the U.S. base in Guam and missile defense ships to sea between Japan and the rogue nation . Is North Korea's missile system a threat? Today South Korea's defence minister said that North Korea has moved a missile with 'considerable range' to its east coast. Officials said there were no signs the North Koreans planned to test fire their new longer-range KN-08 road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile. The range he described could refer to a mobile North Korean missile known as the Musudan. What is the Musudan? The Musudan, also known as the Nodong-B or the Taepodong-X, is an intermediate-range ballistic missile. It has a range of 3,000 kilometres (1,800 miles) - that would make Japan and South Korea potential targets, but little is known about the missile's accuracy. What is the KN-08?Adm. James Winnefeld, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, noted this missile could probably hit the U.S - it is thought he means Alaska. Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel cited the KN-08 as a justification for the administrationâ€™s decision to deploy 14 additional missile interceptors in Alaska. The North Korean military claims it has a range of 10,000 kilometres, but military experts believe that the 18-metre-long KN-08 has a range of 6,000 kilometres. It is a concern as it is road-mobile and easy to hide. Is the U.S. strong enough? North Korea isn't thought to have nuclear-armed missiles that can hit the United States and is extremely unlikely to launch a direct attack on Seoul or its U.S. ally, knowing that military retaliation would threaten the leadership's survival. This week the Pentagon deployed two Aegis-equipped missile defense ships to operate off the Korean peninsula. It is readying long-range ground-based interceptors in Alaska and California. It is also deploying one of its newest ground-based missile defences to the Pacific.What about the nuclear power station? North Korea's vow to restart its mothballed nuclear facilities raises fears about assembly lines churning out fuel for a fearsome arsenal of nuclear missiles. But it may actually be a sign that Pyongyang needs a lot more bomb fuel to back up its nuclear threats. Despite the bluster, it could be years before North Korea completes the laborious process of creating more weaponized fuel. Its announcement, experts say, is also likely an effort to boost fears meant to keep its leadership safe while trying to extract concessions from the U.S. and its allies. 'Nuclear . material can be very corrosive. Cleaning the chemical equipment for . reprocessing plutonium can be an overwhelming task,' No said. North . Korea isn't thought to have nuclear-armed missiles that can hit the . United States and is extremely unlikely to launch a direct attack on . Seoul or its U.S. ally, knowing that military retaliation would threaten . the leadership's survival. Experts estimate it has enough . plutonium for between four to eight crude plutonium-based weapons. But . North Korea has yet to show that it has mastered the technology needed . to shrink down warheads so they can be placed on missiles, although . Pyongyang has bragged - as recently as Thursday - that it has 'smaller, . lighter' nuclear weapons ready to strike the U.S. To . back up that boast, however, Pyongyang needs more tests, which would . deplete its limited supply of nuclear fuel. This motivation may . partially explain the vow to restart Nyongbyon. Two . other larger plutonium reactors had construction halted because of a . past nuclear disarmament deal; Hecker said the North Koreans claim both . are unsalvageable. North Korea is also thought to be making progress on building a small experimental light-water reactor. The North also suggested this week that it was boosting uranium enrichment efforts. North Korea's uranium program worries Washington because the centrifuges that enrich the fuel into bomb-grade material are much easier to conceal than bulky plutonium reactors, which produce large amounts of heat that can easily be seen by satellites. A crude uranium bomb is also easier to produce than one made with plutonium, and North Korea has large natural uranium deposits. Hecker was shown 2,000 uranium centrifuges at Nyongbyon in 2010, but it's not clear whether the centrifuges have been reconfigured to make highly enriched uranium. It's also unknown what fuel North Korea used in its Feb. 12 test, its third since 2006; a confirmed uranium-based nuclear test would show that North Korea has centrifuges producing highly enriched uranium. North Korea built its secret uranium program at its main nuclear facility without the knowledge of the U.S. intelligence community, Bruce Klingner, a former U.S. intelligence officer and now an analyst at The Heritage Foundation think tank in Washington, said in an email. 'As such, we do not know how many covert uranium enrichment sites North Korea has nor how many uranium weapons they can produce per year.' Still, scientists can't make a uranium bomb overnight. Even if the North's 2,000 centrifuges were configured properly and spinning 24 hours a day, every day for a year, they could only make one or two uranium bombs, said Kune Y. Suh, a nuclear expert at Seoul National University. The North's plan to restart the plutonium reactor looked to some like an admission that Pyongyang hasn't made much progress in its uranium enrichment program. 'Why else would it go to the trouble of a time-consuming and expensive restart to plutonium production at a known and vulnerable facility?' Thielmann asked.","North Korea has vowed to restart its mothballed nuclear facilities .

Goldman Sachs made more money from its investment banking division last year than any point in its 145-year history, except 2007 when the financial crisis struck. The $6billion (£3.6billion) bonanza helped to fuel an average gold-plated payout for its workers of £234,000 each. The average full-time salary in the UK is £27,000. To add to their good fortune, it emerged Goldman Sachs, yesterday dubbed 'Sacks of Gold', plans to pay its workers even more to get round controversial new European bonus laws. Goldman Sachs (Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein pictured) made more money in its investment banking division in 2013 than in any other year in its history . John Mann, the Labour MP and member of the Treasury Select Committee, said: 'Goldman Sachs would be better renamed 'Sacks of Gold' with these extraordinary levels of pay. 'It is a shame that such talent is not used in science, technology and medicine for the good of the country.' Under the new rules, a banker can be paid a bonus equal to their annual salary. It is also possible to pay a bonus worth twice their annual salary, if shareholders approve. The new rules only affect European banks, or the European offices of banks whose headquarters are based elsewhere in the world. As a result, London-based bankers at Goldman Sachs were demanding to leave the capital and move to places such as Dubai and Hong Kong where they would not be hit by the cap. At present, a Goldman Sachs worker is typically paid a basic salary plus an annual bonus. Under the new proposals, senior staff will also get a third tranche of pay, known as 'role-based pay'. Labour MP John Mann said the bank 'would be better renamed Sacks of Gold' This will protect their bonus payouts because it will be a multiple - one or two times - of a larger payout, that is their basic salary plus their new role-based pay. The Chancellor has launched legal action against the European Union's bonus cap over fears it will have the opposite effect of pushing up basic salaries. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: 'While millions continue to suffer from joblessness, real wages falls and cuts in public services, Goldman Sachs is brazenly showing who the main beneficiaries of the recovery are with another bumper year for their investment bankers. 'The very people who caused the crash are now hogging the fruits of recovery for themselves, and governments are letting them get away with it.' Over the last decade, Goldman Sachs estimates it has paid around £10billion in tax in the UK from corporation tax to income tax paid by its workers. Goldman Sachs was paid £2.8million for its role as one of the banks involved in the privatisation of Royal Mail. The shares, priced at £3.30, were yesterday worth nearly double at £6.04 each. It comes after Sir Philip Hampton, chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, expressed his shock at bankers who are 'absolutely outraged' to only earn £4million a year. At a conference last year, he revealed the 'completely out of body experiences' negotiating people's pay packages at the State-owned bank with people who occupy a 'different world.' Sir Philip recalled one meeting when a man was complaining bitterly that he only earned £4million a year when a rival at another bank earned £6million for doing the same job. He said: 'I can tell you I've had some completely out of body experiences in recent years where I was talking to somebody about potentially getting a £4million pay package. The bank also announced plans to pay employees more as a way to get round new European bonus laws . 'And outrage coming across the table from the other side because they know that somebody doing a comparable job at another bank is getting £6million. 'And this is absolutely outrageous to them. That somebody is getting 50 per cent more.' Sir Philip, who earns a basic salary of £750,000 a year, said many bankers think it is 'very, very, very unfair that they are only left with £4million to rub along with.' Goldman Sachs said its total 'compensation' pot was reduced by $155million (£95million), and that this money was given to its charity, Goldman Sachs Gives.","The boost fuelled an average gold-plated payout of £234,000 per worker .

Yankees drugs cheat Alex Rodriguez has broken his silence over his season-long ban to declare that the break could actually benefit his career. The slugger, who is suing Major League Baseball and the player's union over the suspension, refused to address his legal battle but said he was looking forward to returning to the game fresh next year. He said: 'I think that in the year 2014, the league could have done me a favour because I've played 20 years without a timeout. 'I think 2014 will be a year to rest, mentally, physically prepare myself for the future and begin a new chapter of my life.' Breaking his silence: Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez told a press conference in Mexico that his season-long drugs ban could benefit his career by giving him a chance to rest mentally and physically . Yankees captain Derek Jeter says he has been left 'saddened' by Alex Rodriguez's ban. The shortstop, who has played with Rodriguez for ten years, said the affair has been 'kind of messy'. He said there had been 'communication' with his disgraced teammate, adding: 'He's human. I'm sure it's a rough situation.' 'Other than that, it is what it is,' Jeter told the New York Daily News. He was speaking to media at the Seminole Hard Rock & Casino during the launch party for his celebrity golf tournament. Rodriguez spoke in Spanish at a press conference in Mexico City to announce the opening of a gym he is affiliated with, but did not take questions. Video of his appearance was aired on ESPN early this morning. The third baseman thanked his well-wishers who included not just his Yankees teammates, but also 'players from other teams, retired players, Hall of Fame players' as well as 'lots of good people, owners of other teams.' He said he intended to see out the three years he will have left on his contract from next year and wants 'to finish his career in New York'. He plans to take part in spring training which he is entitled to do. His ban, which was reduced from 211 games last weekend, is the longest ever in baseball for the use of performance-enhancing drugs and will cost Rodriguez $25 million in salary. He filed a lawsuit Monday in federal court against both Major League Baseball and the player’s union seeking to overturn his banishing for the 2014 season. The lawsuit also made public the entire 33-page decision made by arbitrator Fredric Horowitz after a series of contentious hearings between A-Rod, the league, the player’s union and Tony Bosch. A man of his word: Alex Rodriguez vowed Saturday in a statement to take the fight to federal court . ‘We recognize the standard to overturn an arbitration is a high one,’ attorney Jordan Siev, part of A-Rod’s legal team, told ESPN. ' But we think this proceeding was so flawed from beginning to end'. The suit comes only one day after 60 Minutes aired a shocking interview during which Mr Bosch admitted to personally injected steroids into Mr Rodriguez, directing his doping regimen and even drawing blood from him in a Miami nightclub bathroom stall. ‘Given the intense public interest in this matter and Commissioner Selig's disclosures last night on 60 Minutes, it's difficult to imagine that any portion of this proceeding should be under seal,’ U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III said during the hearing. ‘Mr Rodriguez is directed to file his unredacted complaint with the attached exhibits,’ he added. The third baseman’s legal team had originally brought a redacted lawsuit ‘in an abundance of caution,’ according to Mr Siev, who said Mr Rodriguez and his lawyers were afraid of running afoul of the collective bargaining agreement between the players union and the league. Out in the open: The lawsuit comes only one day after Tony Bosch spilled the beans to '60 Minutes' ‘We're perfectly content to unredact and file the entire complaint,’ Mr Siev continued. Players Association lawyer Dave Prouty unsuccessfully argued in favour of the redacted complaint, saying ‘the [union] believes that those matters should stay confidential, that is, the decision and the underlying proceedings.’ ‘We're thrilled,’ said Mr Siev. ‘We want the entire record to be public. We want everyone to be able to see exactly what Bosch said.’ A-Rod legal team frontman Joe Tacopina had to participate in the hearing via telephone, ESPN noted, but Mr Siev picked up right where his co-defense council left off last night on ’60 Minutes.’ ‘The introduction of triple, quadruple hearsay, inauthentic documents, documents that were stolen not once, but twice that were presented out of order, that were presented in incomplete fashion that Bosch couldn't even identify - all of this was relied on without question by (Horowitz),’ Mr Siev griped. Mr Rodriguez’s team was denied access to the actual Blackberries. ‘MLB had two experts that were allowed to examine those Blackberries with unfettered access. We didn't get one,’ Mr Siev continued. No refuting: MLB COO Rob Manfred told '60 Minutes' that A-Rod never tried to defend himself against Mr Bosch's allegations during the arbitration hearings that resulted in the 162-game ban . The lawyer then bashed MLB Commissioner Bud Selig for talking to ’60 Minutes’ but not testifying during the hearing, which famously caused Mr Rodriguez to storm out in a fit. ‘One thing that was very interesting was whenever we had discussions on ways to resolve this, MLB was adamant that they wanted 162 games,’ said Mr Siev. ‘Lo and behold, where did this decision come out? It is all in the complaint.’ MLB chief operating officer Rob Manfred was quick to point out that the 14-time all-star never testified during the arbitration hearings in his own defense, he never tried to refute Mr Bosch’s claims. The ballplayer claimed in a statement issued shortly after the suspension was announced that the arbitration process was unfair and that the deck was stacked against him. Running out of options: A-Rod has no where else to turn should this lawsuit not go his way . 'This is one man's decision, that was not put before a fair and impartial jury, does not involve me having failed a single drug test,' the former MVP said. The league will almost certainly call him to the stand during the upcoming civil trial – and he can be asked about anything, including steroids, human growth hormone and whatever else he may have ingested. The only way Mr Rodriguez is likely to get his suspension overturned is by testifying under oath or submitting a sworn document he didn’t take the drugs he is accused of taking, a New York Daily News legal analyst said. Should he go that route and be found guilty of taking the banned substances, the next chapter in this saga would be a criminal trial. The player fans deride as A-Roid will finally have his day in court either way, but the truth may set him free or see him locked up.","Third baseman says the break will allow him to rest mentally and physically .

Season five of A&E's hit reality show about redneck millionaires, Duck Dynasty, premiered Wednesday night and MailOnline can reveal some stunning photos of the show's matriarch from her debutante days as a high school cheerleader and classic beauty before becoming a national celebrity. Kay Robertson - known as 'Ms. Kay' - to her friends and family, is the wife of Phil Robertson, who recently made headlines over controversial comments he made in an interview with GQ magazine, and the mother of Will Robertson, the CEO of the Duck Commander duck-call empire, and the star of the show that put the Robertson clan on the map. Beauty: Kay Robertson started dating her now-husband, Phil, when she was just 14 years old . Love: Despite struggles, the Robertsons have been married for more than 45 years and recently renewed their vows . Young bride: Kay married Phil when he was in college and she was just 16 years old . Ms. Kay was born in Louisiana in 1950 and married Phil Robertson when she was just 16 years old. The couple has four sons - Allan, Jase, Willie and Jep - and several grandchildren, including an adoptive daughter of Willie's who is set to appear on the show for the first time on the season five premier. But life for Kay and Phil Robertson hasn't always been duck calls and roses - before Phil became religious, he had alcohol and anger issues. In the 1970s, Phil was running a bar, drinking excessively and getting into fights. As Ms. Kay describes it, he was 'headed south.' Popular: Kay was voted class personality at North Caddo High School in her freshman year in 1962 . Rah: Kay was a cheerleader throughout her time at North Caddo High School in Vivian, Louisiana . Stunning: In her sophomore year at North Caddo High School, Kay was voted class beauty . At one point, in a drunken rage, Phil Robertson kicked Kay and his entire family out of their home before begging her to come back. 'What kept me there? What made me stay with him? It was words my grandmother said: ""One man, one wife, for one life,'"" Kay Robertson told Sports Spectrum. Phil Robertson turned his life around and became religious. Kay forgave him and the couple is still together after more than 45 years. Debutante: Kay, seen her being escorted to the North Caddo High School homecoming in 1963 . Stars: Kay has a large role on Duck Dynasty as the matriarch/full-time cook for the entire Robertson clan . New addition: On Wednesday's episode, the Robertson's welcomed Willie's daughter Rebecca back to the bayou after an internship in Los Angeles . Television critics expected Wednesday's premier of the shows fifth season to be a litmus test to determine whether the show lost viewers after Phil Robertson's controversial comments about homosexuals that were revealed last month. 'Don’t be deceived. Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers—they won’t inherit the kingdom of God. Don’t deceive yourself. It’s not right,' Robertson told the magazine. Backlash from his comments led to a call for a boycott of the show, and had A&E indefinitely suspend the Robertson patriarch before backlash to the suspension led to his reinstatement. 'For Seasons 1 through 4, this reality series about a Louisiana family . that makes duck calls was harmless fun for anyone other than ducks,' New York Times television writer Neil Genzlinger wrote in his column about the show's season five premier. 'Now . it has been politicized, which is too bad.' Wednesday's premier featured a new addition to the Robertson clan, Willie's foster duaghter Rebecca, who is joing her family in the bayou after completing an internship in Los Angeles.","A&E's Duck Dynasty premiers its fifth season on Wednesday night# .

Children as young as 15 are to be allowed to watch films filled with obscene language. Swear words are now so ‘commonplace’ among teenagers that age ratings will be relaxed, censors said yesterday. The British Board of Film Classification claims parents accept it is ‘game over’ when protecting their children from bad language. Controversy: The Woman in Black, starring Daniel Radcliffe, received more complaints than any other film in the past four years, according to the British Board of Film Classification . Under the new rules, even 12-year-olds could potentially be exposed to more profanities. Children’s charities, parents’ groups and politicians reacted angrily to the move, which they said amounted to a free-for-all. ‘It is truly outrageous – parents and children are being let down by a regulator who is no longer interested in regulating,’ said Pippa Smith, of the charity Safermedia. Margaret Morrissey, of the family group Parents Outloud, asked: ‘If no standards are set by adults, what chance do our children have of being polite and decent grown-ups and parents?’ Updating its guidance for cinema films and DVDs, the BBFC said from February 24 it would be ‘more flexible about allowing very strong language at 15’. Language: More than 50 parents said that the swearing and sexual innuendo of Men in Black 3 meant that it should not have been rated PG . An accompanying report insisted there was evidence of a softening of attitudes toward the most offensive words, ‘especially among younger respondents’. The board’s researchers sought the opinions of 10,000 people including, for the first time, 1,040 children aged 13 to 18. Previously, films classified as suitable for 15-year-olds were not permitted to ‘endorse discriminatory language or behaviour’. While strong language was banned, ‘aggressive or repeated use of the strongest language’ was unlikely to be allowed. Now, however, the guidance states that ‘there may be racist, homophobic or other discriminatory themes and language’. It adds that very strong language may be permitted depending on the context. It said: ‘Reluctantly, parents were accepting that there have been shifts in language in recent years and awareness and use of the word “f***” in particular, is almost commonplace, even for primary school aged children. ‘Even if their own children are not using language at home, parents are aware that it has become an accepted part of young people’s lives and its use in the school playground as well as with social media, mobile phones and the internet is widespread.’ It said that especially among boys of 14 and 15 years the C-word ‘was seen to be part of their vernacular’. Films rated 12A – which can be viewed by younger children if accompanied by an adult – have always allowed ‘moderate language’ and ‘infrequent’ strong language. Now, guidance states that ‘strong language may be permitted’ even if frequent, with certain conditions on whether it is justified by its context. The research report accompanying the guidance states: ‘By aged 15, most parents argued that it was “game over” and they could no longer control their child’s viewing. 'The shock value of bad language is felt to be diminishing with each generation.’ But last night Philip Davies, a Tory MP on the culture, media and sport select committee, said: ‘This reflects the general decline in good behavioural standards. ‘It makes children think it’s perfectly normal and reasonable to use bad language. I would rather they weren’t exposed to even worse levels of swearing. ‘They are still children at 15 and are already exposed to things in films at a younger age than I would care for them to be exposed to. ‘I would like to think that people would want to bring up their children to know that that isn’t acceptable.’ Mrs Smith added: ‘Everyone except the BBFC and broadcast media knows children will copy the swearing they hear. ‘Films make it cool. We dread to think what this latest announcement will mean for films deemed acceptable by the BBFC – an industry-funded body –for our children.’ Vivienne Pattison of Mediawatch said: ‘Swearing is not tolerated anywhere else in life – kids can’t do it at school, you can’t do it in public. 'So it is quite extraordinary that they’re just saying “Well, it’s a free-for-all in 15-rated films”. 'There is this idea that you just have to accept obscene language because we’ve got an evolving contemporary society and that’s just how it is. But, actually, no we don’t.’ Obscene: The Wolf on Wall Street contains 506 F-words in under three hours . Mrs Morrissey said: ‘Films and internet have done much to lower the tone and values of society. ‘We must remember young adults are the next generation of young parents.’ The new guidelines offer a subtle but significant shift – stating discriminatory language is ‘unlikely’ to be acceptable and that dangerous behaviour ‘must be clearly disapproved of’ if shown. There will be a crackdown, however, on words such as ‘crap’ which parents complained about hearing in films including the animated feature, The Pirates! In An Adventure With Scientists! Greater attention will now be paid by censors to horror movies and the psychological impact they can have on children, and to the sexualisation of girls, the content of music videos and the ease of accessibility of online porn. David Cooke, director of the BBFC, said: ‘Regular public consultation is crucial to continued public trust in what we do. ‘Our new classification guidelines reflect explicitly concerns raised by the public during the 2013 consultation and will, I believe, ensure that we continue to be in step with what the public wants and expects in order to make sensible and informed viewing decisions. ‘There is also room for continued improvement.’ The British Board of Film Classification has also announced plans to clamp down on raunchy music videos in the UK. Videos made featuring artists such as Miley Cyrus, Rihanna and Britney Spears could be targeted following the large-scale public consultation. The body said there are ‘special worries’ about sexual content in music videos. The vow to crack down on the videos came as the BBFC released a report stating that parents are losing control over what their children watch. In its report it noted: ‘A specific issue highlighted by the consultation is in relation to sexual content, where the public is particularly concerned about the sexualisation of girls, and pornography. ‘The content of music videos and the ease of accessibility of online porn are special worries.’ It also said the ‘sexualisation of young girls was of particular concern’. ‘Music videos were identified as a key source of sexual imagery, which parents believed to be potentially harmful to young girls’ emotional wellbeing and social development,’ the report said. ‘The overwhelming reaction to the music videos content was one of shock and incredulity.’","Films aimed at teenagers will be allowed to feature more bad language under new guidelines unveiled by the BBFC .

The Little Couple star has released a new picture showing her in a hospital bed as she receives chemotherapy treatment. Jen Arnold, the matriarch of the TLC reality show, has taken the opportunity to thank her own mother as she goes through treatment for a rare form of cancer. 'My parents have been a great support during this challenging time! Love them! @judy_arnold,' she wrote as her lookalike mother posed beside her in the hospital bed. Grateful: Jen Arnold posted this photo to her Twitter account alongside her mother during chemotherapy treatment . The neonatologist-turned-reality star has been actively updating her fans about her health over social media ever since announcing the diagnosis in December, shortly after she and her husband brought their second adopted child to their home in Texas. Dr Arnold and her husband both have dwarfism due to a genetic condition, and her cancer diagnosis came after she had already been very open about their fertility struggles. In addition to posting photos of her adorable toddler Will, she regularly updates about how '#ChemoSucks' and the victories of accomplishing everyday tasks like taking down the Christmas decorations. An initial setback came when her chemotherapy had been postponed for a week because of low blood counts, but said the 'silver lining' was that she was able to have 'a better Xmas' with her family. Updates: Arnold has been very open during her illness and updating her thousands of fans often . Adjusting: The neonatologist and mother-of-two has decided to wear a wig for much of her treatment . She certainly made the most of it, baking cookies with her son Will, 3, and daughter Zoey, 2, while her husband Bill Klein cooked an Italian feast for Christmas Eve. She also shared pictures of her boy enjoying his presents on Christmas morning. Arnold, who has been wearing a wig, detailed the terrifying moment that she learned something was wrong in an interview with  People magazine. 'There are moments I feel just terrible,' she told the publication. 'I can't believe it is happening. Other times, I feel like this is just a bump in the road.' The couple adopted son, Will, from China and they were in India to bring home their new daughter Zoey in October when Arnold began bleeding.

The couple adopted him from China last year . Desperate to stay with her daughter but feeling increasingly faint, Arnold made the difficult decision to return home. Once back in the U.S., she was diagnosed with stage 3 choriocarcincoma, a cancer sparked by a non-viable pregnancy she had suffered. Her fertility issues have been well documented on the show, and she was shocked when she became pregnant in August - although she said she was not surprised that an ultrasound showed the baby had no heartbeat. 'I had figured it wasn't going to be viable,' she told People magazine. The embryo was removed but cells were left behind and sparked the quick-growing cancer. She began intensive chemotherapy while her husband was still in India. But the mass in her uterus failed to respond to the chemo and grew four times its size - and then three tumors appeared in her lungs. 'Sometimes I think, ""Seriously? Really? How can this be happening?""' she told People. Doctors were forced to give her a hysterectomy - which they saw as their last resort because of Arnold's small airway.","The 39-year-old was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer of the uterus after bleeding during a trip to adopt her daughter in India .

Sally Davies warned the number of women choosing to have children later in life is a 'worrying issue' The country’s chief  medical officer has warned that the number of women who are choosing to have children later in life is a ‘worrying issue’. Professor Dame Sally Davies said that trying to start a family in their late 30s and early 40s would reduce women’s chance of conception and could increase the medical risks. She went on to say: ‘The steady shift to have children later, there are issues with that. We all assume we can have children later but actually we may not be able to.’ She also expressed concern that ‘many more women’ are choosing not to have children. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that 20 per cent of women now reach the age of 45 without having children – twice the proportion than the previous generation, born in 1945. Professor Dame Sally insisted that she was not suggesting women should have children  earlier, saying: ‘It’s not for me to tell women what to do.’ But she pointed out that it was a well-known fact that fertility declines as women get older. Dame Sally, who earns more than £225,000 a year as the Government’s top medical adviser, also said that breastfeeding should be an accepted part of everyday office life – even in meetings. Addressing an event organised by the Wellbeing of Women charity in London yesterday, Dame Sally, 64, said that one way of boosting women’s prospects in the workplace would be by encouraging them to breastfeed at work. She then talked candidly about the time that she shocked male colleagues when she attempted to breastfeed her daughter during a meeting. Speaking of the need to make breastfeeding more ‘acceptable’, she said: ‘I was there in this giant shirt with a baby hiding under it and a comment was made and my response was quite sharp.’ Dame Sally – a consultant specialising in blood disorders – also said women doctors were currently ‘underestimated,’ poorly paid and far less likely to be in positions of power compared to men. And she used her speech to try to encourage the NHS to do more to ensure that women can ‘make it up the ladder’. Over the last decade the number of female doctors has increased by 50 per cent and by 2022 they are expected to outnumber men for the first time. But as many only work part-time to look after children,  concerns have been raised that it has led to staffing shortages and gaps on the rota. Dame Sally said the country ought to learn how to accept breastfeeding in the workplace and make it a normal issue rather than a feminist one. File image . Only this week Chris Ham, chief executive of the King’s Fund think-tank, said an increase of women doctors was partly to blame for a current shortage of A&E medics. But Dame Sally, who also has two grown-up daughters, said: ‘I’m getting very bored with being one of the only women in the room. ‘Women are underestimated across the medical profession. ‘Breastfeeding has increased in  the UK, steadily but it is not increasing enough. ‘But how do we make it more acceptable in the workplace. ‘How do we make it more accessible for women to breastfeed their child without making it a feminist issue and instead making it a normal issue.’ She went on to call for equal pay for male and female doctors, saying : ‘Women doctors are underestimated in senior positions. ‘You would still however expect women working in medicine to get the same salaries.’ In August Dame Sally revealed that she had experimented with  cannabis two or three times whilst at university but stopped after  suffering hallucinations.","She warned the chance of conception reduces in late 30s and early 40s .

David Cameron has promised to give up sweet treats for a day – with the support of his wife – to back the campaign against obesity. He said he will try to take up the challenge to have no sugar and no sugary drinks on one day this week. The Prime Minister acknowledged that diabetes and obesity were ‘major health concerns’. Challenge: David Cameron has vowed to give up sugar for a day in support of the campaign against obesity - but he suggested he may need his wife's help . Senior Labour MP Keith Vaz attempted to enlist Mr Cameron’s support in the ‘war on sugar’. He warned voluntary measures to ensure manufacturers cut the sugar content in food and drinks by up to 30 per cent had not worked, adding that obesity and type 2 diabetes were ‘twin epidemics’. After Mr Vaz asked him at Prime Minister’s Questions to take up the sugar-free challenge, Mr Cameron replied: ‘I’m sure that last proposal would have the strong support of Mrs Cameron so I will take that up if I possibly can. ‘Can I commend you for… speaking out on the issues of diabetes and obesity with such consistency, because they are major health concerns for our country. Commended: David Cameron praised Keith Vaz for speaking out on issues of diabetes and obesity . ‘We are taking them very seriously.

Attack: Headmistress Gillian Kay, pictured arriving to give evidence at Manchester Crown Court, was left with 3cm deep wounds to her head and neck . A primary school head teacher lay on her driveway screaming and pleading for her life after she was stabbed by her paranoid schizophrenic next-door neighbour, a court heard. Mark Pierson allegedly shouted 'I’m going to kill you you f***ing b****’ before stabbing Gillian Kay in the head and neck with a 4in screwdriver. The frenzied attack was only interrupted when a passing motorist spotted what was happening and intervened, jurors heard. Pierson, 48, then 'calmly walked off' into his parents' house. He had known the headmistress for 10 years and in his pocket was a piece of paper saying 'Gna kill u k', the court heard. He was quickly arrested - telling police he had suffered 'ten years of abuse' and had three plastic bag full of thousands of documents to prove it. Bruised and bloodied, 39-year-old Mrs Kay was airlifted to hospital where she survived, despite suffering a 3cm deep cut to the side of her head and and another to the lower back of her skull, which had hair pushed into the wound. Today she returned to give evidence against her neighbour from behind a screen at Manchester Crown Court. Mrs Kay, who lives with her husband Martin and daughter Lauren in Royton, Greater Manchester, said the attack happened in April last year as she returned from work at Propps Hall primary school in nearby Oldham. She said: 'I got home at about 5pm and there was nobody around when I pulled on to the drive. 'I went round to the boot to get my laptop and noticed someone standing next to me, then I realised it was Mark Pierson. I didn’t have a chance to say anything to him. Frenzied: The scene outside Gillian Kay's house in Royton, Greater Manchester, after she was attacked . 'He was less than a metre away from me. I just saw him staring at me and before I had a chance and before I had a chance to say anything he went into his jacket and pulled out a screwdriver. 'I was so petrified. As soon as he pulled it out he started attacking me with it. I didn’t say anything and he was saying ""I’m going to kill you, you f***ing b****."" 'He had a really contorted face. He looked really angry. He was aiming at my face. The only way I can describe it is frenzied. It was really quick with no pauses in between. 'I felt the blows go into my head. He was using a lot of force because he had pulled on my jacket to pull me to him so I was close to him. The force pushed me on the floor so I was on my back. I was trying to fight him off.' Mrs Kay's next-door neighbour Mark Pierson was ruled unfit to plead to any criminal charges due to mental illness . She screamed but the attack continued, she said. 'I remember kicking him to try and put space between us but my body twisted and then he got the back of my head,' she said. 'I continued screaming all the way through. He was saying ‘I want to get you, you b****’. 'It felt like it was going on forever. I was screaming and screaming and finding it hard to keep him off me. I remember thinking ""this is it"", then a white van pulled into the side of the road. 'Then he got off me and dropped the screwdriver and went towards his house. The neighbours were now around and then my husband. Heather [neighbour] was holding my head and trying to stop the blood.' Survived: Gillian Kay gave evidence from behind a screen against her alleged attacker . Pierson was ruled unfit to plead or stand trial due to his 'paranoid persecutory delusions'. Therefore he is not charged with a criminal offence - a jury must instead look at the evidence and decide if Pierson committed the attack or not. If they find he attacked Mrs Kay, he will most likely have a hospital order imposed on him. Mr Kay had known Pierson for 10 years and grew familiar with him through his parents, the court heard, though there had been 'some issues' between them. During her evidence, Pierson was heard to shout to Mrs Kay: 'I wanted you in court, I didn’t want you dead.' He also interrupted proceedings with shouts of 'perjury, perjury' while Mrs Kay spoke from behind a screen. Prosecutor Charlotte Crangle said that when police arrested Pierson, he claimed he had been harassed for ten years and pointed towards plastic bags that contained essential evidence. 'In the bags were thousands of pages of documents written by Pierson. He was put in the van and searched. He had another screwdriver in the lining of his coat. The other screwdriver was spotted close to Mrs Kay with blood stains on. 'There was some blood from Mrs Kay on the defendant’s jeans and a small bit of paper was found in his jeans pocket which refers to killing someone. It said ""Gna kill u k"". 'In this ferocious and frightening attack, the threats that he was going to kill her and the paper in his pocket, coupled with where the blows were aimed at can only lead to one conclusion and that is you can have no doubt that he was trying to kill Gillian Kay on that day.' The hearing continues.","Gillian Kay, 39, attacked with screwdriver near Oldham, Greater Manchester .

Attacked: Sir John Gurdon, 80, was throttled by his alcoholic son in the family's mansion, a judge was told . The alcoholic son of a Nobel Prize winning biologist tried to strangle his father and hit his mother in the family's £1.8million home, a court heard. William Gurdon, 45, attacked his father Professor Sir John Gurdon, 80, and mother Lady Jean when they confronted him about his drinking. The unemployed man - who admitted carrying out the assault on his elderly parents - is addicted to alcohol and has previously been treated at The Priory, the judge was told. His father, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine in 2012 for pioneering cloning research, was attacked when he told his son he should go to rehab again. Following the incident, Gurdon moved out of the family home in Whittlesford, Cambridgeshire, and was staying in a £140-a-night bed and breakfast. But Cambridge Magistrates Court heard that his parents have forgiven him and he is now undergoing treatment. On the day of the attack, Lady Jean, 77, made her son a full English breakfast after smelling that he had been drinking at 8.30am, the judge heard. After cleaning his plate Gurdon went back to his room, but returned to the kitchen later to make a pizza for lunch. While he was there, his father suggested that it was time for his son to confront his drinking. When Lady Jean returned home, her son had become 'very aggressive'. Magistrates in Cambridge heard how he 'lurched' towards his father and pushed his mother to the ground before 'squeezing his neck'. Lady Jean called the police and he was later arrested. District Judge Ken Sheraton said: 'Your behaviour was disgraceful. Your parents have given you money and provided you with a place to live, and you treated them in the way you have. Forgiveness: Sir John's son William moved out of the family home in Whittlesford, Cambridgeshire, after carrying out the attack, the court was told. However, the family have since forgiven him . Attacked: Sir John Gurdon's wife Lady Jean who was also assaulted by her son in the family home . 'You got drunk and pushed your mother over so she hit her head on the floor causing injury. 'You then pushed your father onto the floor and grabbed him by the throat and attempted to strangle him. 'I would like to send you straight to prison today but it seems your parents have not requested a restraining order, which suggests there may be a time when they would have you back in their lives. 'The only way it would be safe for that to happen is for you to stop drinking at all, and you would not receive that help in prison.' Gurdon admitted two counts of assault when he appeared before the judge yesterday. The court heard he was drunk when police arrived at the family home on October 31 and he claimed to have a knife - though a weapon was never found. Paul Brown, prosecuting, told the . court: 'The defendant has problems with alcohol and was drinking half a . bottle of Bacardi a day. He had previously been to the The Priory rehab . clinic. 'When Jean got back home at 1.30pm, William was being very aggressive towards his father. 'Then . suddenly William lurched towards John and pushed his mother out of the . way, knocking her to the floor causing a cut to her head. Leading academic: Prof Gurdon with a Kyoto University professor. The Cambridge academic was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine in 2010 . 'When she got up she saw John on his back on the floor with William standing over him and his hands squeezing his neck. 'She tried to pull him off but he was too strong so she shouted at him. John was making choking noises.' In a victim statement read to the court by Mr Brown, Lady Jean said there was 'no excuse' for her son's behaviour. It read: 'I am shocked at what William has done. Alcohol may have been a cause but it doesn't excuse him for try to strangle his father.' Nick Symonds, mitigating, said it was an 'unusual living situation' which had come about partly due to his client's epilepsy. He said: 'He has struggled to find work and has no money of his own, other than £20,000 of savings which he was given by his parents. 'At the time of the offence he was drinking everyday and now he only drinks two evenings a week.' Gurdon, who has no previous convictions, was given a six-week prison sentence suspended for a year, with 12 months of supervision, including an alcohol treatment programme. He must also pay £85 court costs. Speaking after the hearing, Lady Jean, who also has a daughter, said her son would now be moving back into their mansion. She said: 'William has been very remorseful; his actions had a lot to do with drink. 'We are welcoming him back to our home and he is trying to get himself cured of all his problems. We love him dearly and want to help him. 'These past weeks have been awful for the family as we haven’t been able to see William. 'Now we want to put the incident behind us and move forward.'

The global economy is slowly picking up steam, led by advanced economies which have reached a 'turning point' after five years of financial crises and a continued good performance by China, the World Bank said. However, it said that growth prospects remain vulnerable to rising interest rates and potential volatility in capital flows as the U.S. Federal Reserve eases up on the extraordinary stimulus it has been providing to the world's largest economy. The bank's twice-yearly Global Economics Prospects report says global growth is expected to firm from 2.4 per cent in 2013 to 3.2 per cent this year and 3.4 per cent in 2015. The report said the momentum that countries such as the United States and Japan are building up should support stronger growth in the developing countries. Welcome news: Stock markets including at the New York exchange (above) were buoyant today after the World Bank said the global economy was at a 'turning point' after years in the doldrums . Presenting the findings, Kaushik Basu, the bank's chief economist, the outlook for the global economy is uneventful . 'It's a strange world we live in that news that an uneventful economy ahead of us is meant to be good news,' Basu said at a news conference at the bank's Washington headquarters. He added: 'But not surprising' that this is the case after years of economic turmoil. Stock markets rose today after the assessment. In early European trading, Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.3 per cent to 6,789.85 and Germany's DAX gained 0.9 per cent to 9,628.74. The CAC-40 in France rose 0.6 per cent to 4,297.62. The report says that although risks to the global economy have subsided, they have not been eliminated and include fiscal uncertainty in the United States, protracted recovery in the euro zone and possible setbacks in China's restructuring policies. The bank said the Federal Reserve's decision to begin trimming its intervention in the market, known as quantitative easing 'is welcome as it reflects increasingly convincing signs that a self-sustaining recovery is under way.' Boost: A woman talking on her mobile phone walks past an advertisement billboard for a new shopping mall in Beijing. The World Bank credited the recovery in part to continued good growth in China . It said the most likely scenario is for the tapering off to follow an orderly trajectory and for global interest rates to rise only slowly, reaching 3.6 per cent by mid-2016. In Japan, the report says, large doses of fiscal and monetary stimulus have sparked a strong cyclical upturn but keeping this going will require structural reforms. The bank says in the euro zone, banks have gone a long way to restructuring themselves but that sector remains weak. Details on a fully fledged banking union are still being worked out 'and the currency bloc remains susceptible to shock.' The report says that although developing country growth in 2013 was relatively weak, at an estimated 4.8 per cent, 'it has been firming in recent months, partly reflecting strengthening growth in high-income countries, but also a recovery from earlier weakness in large middle-income countries, such as India and China.' Looking at regional trends, the bank said growth will be flat in East Asia and the Pacific, modest in Latin America and the Caribbean and held back in the Middle East and North Africa due to social and political strife.","Bank's bi-annual report says growth set to rise from 2.4% to 3.4% in 2015 .

The fear of sexual attack for women in India has become so prevalent it has inspired the country's top female boxer to launch an app to protect potential victims. And the techniques are known to work... as the fighter behind them once used her skills to save herself from a sex attacker. Years before becoming a champion boxer, Mary Kom, who won a bronze medal at the 2012 London Olympics representing her native India, had to fend off an attack from a rikshaw driver. Recalling her escape, she said: 'I remember I went to church wearing a traditional wraparound dress. I was 18 years old and looked very ladylike. Scroll down for video . Training to fight: mary Kom (right) shows punching techniques to a pupil at the Female Fighting Club . Mental strength: As well as preparing women physically, Mary Kom aims to give them the confidence to improve all aspects of their lives . Bare-knuckle brawler: The Olympic boxing bronze medalist once fought off a rikshaw driver who attacked her as a teenager, leaving him with a broken nose . 'The rikshaw driver wanted to do bad things. We were travelling through a quiet area when he tried to do what he wanted.' But, re-enacting the powerful punches she used to protect herself as she spoke, Kom added: 'Boom, boom, boom... he was on the ground - finished.' Standing just 5ft 2in, Kom is a far from intimidating figure. But her fighting skills are borne of a natural confidence that she now wants to pass on to the women of India as the country struggles to deal with an increasing number of sexual attacks on women. In partnership with mobile phone network Vodafone, she has developed an app that will launch later this year, offering basic self-defence tips for women as well as advice and support. The app will include videos demonstrating how to fight off an attacker, with techniques that are simple for anyone to use: From punches and kicks, to scratching with nails and striking with high heeled shoes. A basic version for regular mobile phones rather than smartphones will also become available, giving advice and instruction in text form. But the aim is not just to prepare women physically. What Kom hopes to achieve is ensure that women develop a confidence in themselves, even if it that only means feeling safer when they walk along the street. Ready for the ring: Mary Kom prepares for another bout of training . Mary Kom won a bronze medal in the 2012 London Olympics and aims to pass on some of her skills . Women and girls of all ages will be able to benefit from the training and advice given through the app . 'The app teaches basic things for people who have not done [boxing] before. If it is too hard for them, it will not interest them. 'Hopefully, if they are interested, they will continue to learn.' The techniques taught are basic. But they could mean the difference between life or death. Indians have become hardened to news of rape in their country, but that all changed in 2012 with a gang-rape on a bus that shocked the world and left its victim to die from horribly inflicted injuries. The attack forced the country's government to show it was prepared to tackle the problem, with faster prosecutions and tougher sentences. But only as recently as October, a woman was twice gang-raped before being burned alive - allegedly by gangsters with connections to police and politicians. Part of the problem is India's women continuing to be seen in some quarters as second class citizens. It is a social prejudice Kom has dealt with all her life as the eldest of five siblings growing up in rural Kangathei. Women take to the streets to protest in Calcutta after a gang-rape last October, after which the victim was burned alive for reporting the crime to police . 'When I was a little girl I was always playing fighting games. I was very interested in sports but nobody in my village knew what to do with me. 'People try to discourage what women do. I began my sports career to help my father financially but people say ""you are a girl, you can't do this"" or ""you are a woman you must do this"". I want to give girls the confidence that if a man can do it, they can do it. 'I was the eldest and helping my father but people in the village were telling me not to do things but I would not let it get to me.' The app is just part of Kom's attempts to help women through boxing, having also set up a female fighting club in her home region of Manipur. The club is funded by Vodafone and its new 'Firsts' programme, which supports and encourages first time experiences.

The 43-year-old said she hasn't been as slim since before the birth of her youngest child . Staying trim could hardly have been a problem for Susanna Reid, a busy working mother who also finds the time to compete in marathons. But the addition of Strictly Come Dancing to her hectic schedule has left her at her fittest for nearly a decade – and she says she’s lost a stone in weight to boot. The BBC news presenter who is performing in the Strictly live tour which opens tonight, said she hasn’t been so slim since before she had her youngest son eight years ago, thanks to the gruelling training sessions and energetic routines with dance partner Kevin Clifton. Miss Reid, 43, said: ‘It’s extraordinary how it affects your body, because you are training for such intense, long periods each day. ‘You are never going to be able to do that again, unless you become a . professional dancer, but it is just amazing how fit it makes you. ‘I would say that all in all, I lost about a stone in weight. 'It means that for Kevin, at the beginning of the series we weren’t doing much lifting. Suddenly there appeared to be all these lifts and no one knew why. It was because I was a stone lighter.’ ‘I’m sure if I had thought about it, I could have adapted my diet too, but in the end I just ate what I could, when I could.’ Since she started training for the show in September, she has revealed that her arms have become stronger and more toned, as have her thighs, while her stomach is much flatter. She said recently: ‘Parts of me that were fleshy seem to be disappearing. Other parts remain fleshy, and it’s a shame I don’t have choice which bits go and which bits stay.’ The newsreader who abstains from eating meat but includes fish in her diet, began training for the dance contest in September last year. She made it through to the final of the show alongside model Abbey Clancy, singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor and actress Natalie Gumede last month. As the show progressed Miss Reid and her dance partner Kevin Clifton began to incorporate more lifts into their routines as a result of her losing weight . The mother-of-three said the support of her husband and family allowed her to devote more time to dance rehearsals . She was forced to undergo daily . rehearsal sessions while commuting between the BBC’s Salford studio, . where she presents BBC Breakfast, and London where she lives with her . long-term partner Dominic Cotton and their three children, who are aged . eight, nine and 11. During the show, Miss Reid continued to present BBC Breakfast during the week, returning to London each morning after the show to see her children. She would then travel back to Manchester every evening in time to present the following day’s show. In between she also found time to rehearse, labelling Thursdays ‘smash it Thursday’ when she underwent the longest and hardest sessions ahead of Saturday night’s Strictly performances. Speaking of how she juggled such a hectic work schedule with family life, she said: ‘I am hugely lucky and blessed that I have a partner who is incredibly supportive. 'He himself has a very demanding job, but a very supportive employer and he was able to step in.‘He has always been brilliant and we’ve shared the parenting, but he just took over.

A biological 'switch' that turns on fat busting genes has been discovered - and it is trigger by exercise . A biological ‘switch’ that turns on fat busting genes has been discovered. The finding offers hope of new drugs for slimmers, diabetics and people who suffer from heart disease. The switch is triggered naturally by exercise and scientists believe it could be harnessed to help treat a range of illnesses. Experiments on laboratory mice found they shed weight when the metabolite known as BAIBA (beta-aminoisobutyric acid) was activated. The importance of physical activity in improving health and life expectancy has been long known, but the changes that occur during exercise are less clear. Now, new research published in the journal Cell Metabolism has shown the molecule responsible for these beneficial effects. Dr Robert Gerszten, of Massachusetts General Hospital, said: ‘Our finding bolsters the underlying notion that signals generated in one organ, such as exercising muscle, are released into the circulation and influence other tissues such as fat cells and liver.’ Earlier studies have demonstrated a protein regulates metabolic genes in muscle and contributes to their response to exercise. Now, lab experiments show the protein produces a metabolite called BAIBA (beta-aminoisobutyric acid) and increases fat cells' expression of genes that burn calories. In tests, it also made mice slimmer and helped balance their blood sugar. Analysis done in human exercise and heart studies revealed BAIBA levels rise during exercise and reduce the risk of diabetes and other metabolic disorders. The discovery could lead to the development of drugs for slimmers, diabetics and people with heart disease . The higher the level, the more they decrease blood sugar, insulin and harmful fats including cholesterol. In addition, there was a trend toward lower BMI. The researchers said their findings suggest BAIBA may contribute to exercise induced protection from metabolic diseases. Dr Gerszten added: ‘Manipulating BAIBA, or the enzymes that generate it, may have therapeutic potential. Burning fat is likely to impact multiple aspects of metabolic health related to diabetes, heart disease and other conditions.’","Mice shed weight when BAIBA (beta-aminoisobutyric acid) is activated .

David Cameron today hit back at claims defence cuts mean Britain is no longer a key full military partner to the United States. The Prime Minister dismissed the criticism from Robert Gates, America's former defense secretary, insisting Britain remains a 'first-class' military power. Mr Gates said the UK’s ability to fight on land, sea or in the air has been undermined by moves to slash spending and troop numbers to fill a multi-billion pound blackhole in the defence budget. Scroll down for video . David Cameron rejected criticism from former US Defense Secretary Robert Gates who claimed UK defence cuts means Britain is no longer a full military ally of America . The Government is planning major cuts to the Armed Forces. The Army is being cut from 102,000 to 82,000 over a number of years, with the 20,000 posts expected to be gone by 2020. Navy numbers are expected to fall by 6,000, while the RAF will lose 5,000 staff. Mr Gates, who served under presidents Barack Obama and George Bush, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that naval cuts were particularly damaging, noting that for the first time since the First World War Britain does not have an operational aircraft carrier. He said: ‘What we have always been able to count upon on this side of the Atlantic was British forces had full spectrum capabilities very much along the same lines as our own forces that they could perform a variety of different missions. Former UK Defence Secretary Liam Fox rejected the idea that Britain is not pulling its weight . ‘With the fairly substantial . reductions in defence spending in Great Britain, what we’re finding is . they won’t have full spectrum capabilities and the ability to be able to . be a full partner as they have been in the past. ‘Because I lament our own defence cuts, I would say I also lament that reality in terms of Great Britain,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. But Mr Cameron rejected the criticism. Speaking on a visit to the Crossrail project in central London, the Prime Minister said: 'I don't agree with him. I think he has got it wrong. 'We have the fourth largest defence budget anywhere in the world. We are investing in future capabilities. 'We are a first-class player in terms of defence and as long as I am Prime Minster that is the way it will stay.' However Mr Gates' concerns echoed those of senior military staff in the UK. Last month . General Sir Nicholas Houghton, the Chief of the Defence Staff, warned . that manpower was increasingly seen as an ‘overhead’, and that Britain . was in danger of being left with hollowed out armed forces, with . ‘exquisite’ equipment but without the soldiers, sailors and airmen . needed to man it. He told . the Royal United Services Institute military think-tank that the Royal . Navy was ‘perilously close’ to its ‘critical mass’ in terms of manpower. HoweverLiam  Fox, who was Defence Secretary from 2010 when the coalition was . formed until November 2011, dismissed the idea that Mr Gates’ criticism . would lead to ‘hurt pride’ in the British military. ‘I've sat beside him in a very large number of meetings over the years and I know him very well, and he's been a persistent critic, particularly of European-Nato countries who do not pull their weight.. who are spending 1 per cent of their GDP on defence. ‘The UK need to remember when we did the defence review, we set out the fact that we'd be able to carry out an enduring stabilisation operation at brigade level - that's about 6,500 personnel - while conducting a complex non-enduring one of about 2,000 personnel plus a simple one at the same time. ‘That is far more than any of our allies in Nato outside the US can do. So we're providing a broad range of capabilities.’ Labour's shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker said: 'It should worry David Cameron that Britain's strongest ally has concerns about his Government's mishandling of defence.' The Army is being cut from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020 while the newly-renamed Army Reserve - formerly the Territorial Army - is being expanded from 19,000 to 30,000 . Mr Fox also highlighted that the US is also cutting its spending on the military. ‘The US is making substantial cuts of about $500bn to the Pentagon budget over this decade. America's the world's biggest economy with the world's biggest defence budget. ‘We're the world's eighth biggest economy with the fourth biggest defence budget, so certainly we're pulling our weight on that and we're one of only four or five countries inside Nato to meet our 2 per cent GDP spend commitment. So I don't think we can be questioned on that. ‘Countries in the West who want to be able to spend more on their security need to deal with their economic problems now.’ A Ministry of Defence spokesman said: 'Like the United States, the UK has had to take tough decisions on defence spending, but we still have the fourth largest defence budget in the world and the best-trained and best-equipped armed forces outside the US. 'Over the next decade, we plan to spend GBP160 billion on equipment, to ensure our armed forces retain their formidable range of cutting-edge capabilities and ability to project power across the globe, including by maintaining our major naval presence in the Gulf region. 'Construction of the first new aircraft carrier, the largest ship the Royal Navy has ever operated, is almost complete and the Navy will also operate state-of-the-art type-45 destroyers, new type-26 frigates, and seven new Astute class submarines.'","Britain does not have 'full spectrum capabilities', Robert Gates warns .

A chemical preservative called methylisothiazolinone (MI) in the wipes causes an allergic reaction in some children, researchers found. The chemical has been blamed for a massive rise in dangerous allergic reactions caused by a huge range of beauty products. Until now, no cases of allergic reactions to wet wipes had been reported in the U.S., but the study authors think this could be due to the reactions being misdiagnosed as other conditions, such as eczema. Baby wipes cause some children to come out in severe, itchy, red rashes, new research suggests . ‘I think it may be more common than people realise,’ Dr Mary Wu Chang, an associate professor of dermatology and paediatrics at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine, told NBC News. Scientists at the school of medicine studied six children with severe rashes. The first child was a girl who had a rash on her face and her buttocks. The eight-year-old had already been treated with antibiotics and steroids but after each treatment, the rash reappeared. The scientists suspected that she might be suffering from an allergic reaction so asked her mother what she used to clean her. The girl’s mother explained that she used wet wipes to clean her daughter’s mouth and buttocks. Dr Chang had recently read a report about a Belgian man who was allergic to the MI in baby wipes. She tested the child for an allergy and the results were positive. A chemical preservative called methylisothiazolinone in the wipes causes an allergic reaction in some children . Unsurprisingly, when the girl’s mother then stopped using baby wipes, her rashes disappeared. During the following two years, five more children were brought to the medical centre with similar rashes. In each case, the rash disappeared as soon as the children were no longer cleaned with baby wipes. Despite the discovery, Dr Chang does not believe parents should stop using baby wipes. She . told NBC News: ‘They’re so convenient. I have three kids, so I know how . hard it is to do the changes, especially when you’re travelling. ‘But maybe when you’re at home, it would be better to use a gentle cleanser and water. That way you minimise exposure.’ Dr . Robin Gehris, from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Centre, says . the number of children suffering from these reactions is increasing. Researchers say parents should try to avoid using baby wipes except when they are travelling. They say it is better to use a paper towel with water at home . She believes this could be because the amount of MI in baby wipes has been increased. As a result, she also suggests parents avoid using them except when they are travelling. She says that at home it is better to use wet paper towels. Baby wipes are not the only product to contain MI. Cosmetic giant Johnson & Johnson says it is so concerned, it is taking the chemical out of its best-selling Piz Buin sun cream and other products. Molton Brown is doing the same and big brands such as Nivea, L’Oreal, Clarins and Sanctuary are under pressure to take action as doctors say adverse reactions to the chemical have reached ‘epidemic proportions’. Skin experts say manufacturers should urgently remove the chemical from products that are left on the skin. It can cause rashes, lumps, blisters, itchy eyes and facial swelling. In one case, a woman’s head and face swelled up so much that doctors feared she would have trouble breathing without urgent treatment. In another, a British holidaymaker’s skin became so inflamed that she spent two days in a Spanish hospital and needed steroids and antihistamines to calm the allergic reaction. MI is a preservative designed to extend shelf life, and has no useful properties for users of the products. Experts say the scale of the allergic reactions to the chemical, which has been used increasingly since 2005, is alarming. Dermatologists expect an allergic reaction to a cosmetic product of one or two per cent, but clinics say the rate for MI has been more than 10 per cent. Leading dermatologist Dr Ian White, from St Thomas’ Hospital in London, said: ‘The frequency of reactions to MI is unprecedented in my experience. 'We’ve never seen anything quite like it. Contact allergy to this permitted preservative is now of epidemic proportions. Immediate action needs to be taken by industry.’","Methylisothiazolinon (MI), a preservative, can cause allergic reactions .

A bracelet and app that together observe a person's habits and measures their sun exposure could help make sunburn a thing of the past . Even the most avid wearers of sunscreen have been caught out by the sun and have got a nasty sunburn at some point. But now a bracelet that observes a person’s habits and measures their sun exposure could help make the painful condition a thing of the past. Connected to a smartphone app, the ‘June’ bracelet will send an alert to a sun worshipper to tell them how to avoid becoming too exposed to skin damaging rays. The bracelet, which has yet to go on sale, is aimed at women who want to monitor their sun exposure and has a ‘jewel’ made up of UV sensors. It was launched at the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas and will be available in the second quarter of this year in the U.S. for a price of $99, although UK availability and price has yet to be announced. It will connect to a smartphone app so it can tell the wearer of the bracelet when to apply more sunscreen and put on a hat, based on personal information that they have entered, such as their skin type. ‘Discover when and how to protect from UV rays, avoid sun damage and prevent premature skin ageing,’ the company says on its website. Connected to a smartphone app, the 'June' bracelet will send an alert to a sun worshiper to tell them how to avoid becoming too exposed to skin damaging rays and avoid getting sunburnt . The $99 app gives tailored sun protection advice based on a . person’s habits and skin type, including tips on how to maintain healthy skin. It notifies the wearer of the bracelet when they need to apply SPF, wear a hat or put on . sunglasses. The bracelet measures . sun exposure in realtime and observes the habits of the user. The app, which is produced by Netamo, a firm known for making weather stations, is able to monitor UV sensitivity in realtime as well as tracking sun exposure throughout the day. It will calculate the maximum safe sun exposure for a day and afterwards, tell users when the sun was at its most intense. While other sun care monitoring wearable devices are available, the company claims that June is the first of its kind as it doubles as a fashion item and was designed by a jewellery expert. Made of alloy metal, the jewel sensor comes in three colours - gold, platinum and gunmetal - and can be worn as a brooch as well as attached to a silicone or leather strap that comes with it.

A former army recruitment officer says her life has been ruined because she was left 'partially blinded' by medication which was meant to cure her acne. Rachel Yeo, 26, says she experienced shattering migraines when antibiotics prescribed by her doctor caused fluid to build up around her brain. The mother-of-one has been left with blurred peripheral vision, which prevents her from driving, and requires regular lumbar punctures to ease the increased pressure inside her skull caused by the rare reaction to the routinely-prescribed drug. Rachel Yeo, 26, developed migraines and vision problems after taking Minocycline tablets to treat her acne . She said: ‘I'm waiting for a scan to determine whether my sight problems can be fixed, but the consultants are not optimistic. I'm absolutely gutted.’ Ms Yeo, of Penarth, in Wales, asked her GP for advice in December 2011 after suffering for several years with acne caused by polycystic ovary syndrome. She said: ‘Having spots affected my confidence massively. People looked at me as though I was a teenager. ‘I was always asked to prove my age when I bought alcohol and I felt extremely self-conscious when I attended job interviews. ‘I tried over-the-counter creams but nothing ever worked.’ Her doctor prescribed a three-month course of Minocycline tablets, a form of tetracycline antibiotic. Ms Yeo said: 'Having spots affected my confidence massively. People looked at me as though I was a teenager' After a month of trying the tablets Ms Yeo's acne remained unchanged and she began experiencing a range of troubling symptoms, including severe migraines and flashing and spotted vision. The symptoms became so distracting that Ms Yeo was often forced to ask her mother, Lynette, to babysit her daughter Isabelle, now three, while she recovered. She said: ‘At first, I put the symptoms down to stress. It was frightening. I'd never suffered with anything like it before. ‘The only place I could be comfortable was a dark room. Thank goodness mum was there to help. ‘When my vision became very blurry in October I decided it was time to see an optician. As soon as it affected my normal day-to-day life, I took action. ‘The optician checked me and said there was bleeding in the back of my eyes caused by pressure on my brain.’ Ms Yeo, a former British Army and TA recruitment officer, was rushed to University Hospital of Wales, in Cardiff, where baffled doctors ordered a lumbar puncture to drain fluid from the base of her spine. She said: ‘Doctors were practically queuing up to have a look at the effect of the pressure on the backs of my eyes. They'd never seen anything like it before - that's how rare it was.’ In a discharge summary for the case, drawn up in April 2013, Specialist Registrar in Neurology Dr Joe Anderson diagnosed that Ms Yeo had idiopathic intracranial hypertension precipitated by use of Minocycline. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is high pressure inside the skull which can happen suddenly or build up over time. Ms Yeo (pictured with her daughter, Isabelle, three) was diagnosed with intracranial hypertension - increased pressure in the skull - and has to have lumbar punctures to drain fluid from her skull to reduce the pressure . It can be caused by many things including a brain tumour, an infection and a blood clot. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is that which occurs without an obvious cause. It is most common in overweight women in their 20s and it causes severe headaches and changes in vision. Ms Yeo said: ‘I was immensely stressed. I wondered whether I was somehow to blame, whether I hadn't led a healthy enough lifestyle. All I could think about was my daughter - what if I had to stay in hospital? Who would look after her? ‘I hadn't thought for one moment that the problems were caused by the acne medication. I had no idea that antibiotics would have such drastic effects. When the doctor told me, I was utterly shocked. He said it wasn't unknown to happen.’ Ms Yeo (pictured with a migraine) is no longer able to drive and says she struggles to watch TV because of her sight problems. She says she feels lucky that she is still able to care for her daughter . The NHS Choices website lists intracranial hypertension as a rare side-effect of Minocycline use. It advises patients to seek medical advice if they develop blurred or double vision. Dr Channarayapatna Krishna, a clinical pharmacologist and clinical toxicologist at the University of Wales Hospital, said there were currently no plans to review the use of Minocycline. Intracranial hypertension is high pressure inside the skull. It can occur as a result of a head injury, a stroke, a brain tumour or a brain infection among other things. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is that which occurs for no obvious reason. It is most common in overweight women in their 20s and is linked to hormone problems, certain medications and anaemia. The most common symptoms are severe headaches and changes in vision. The condition can also cause drowsiness, confusion, nausea and vomiting. Treatment options include weight loss, medications, lumbar punctures and surgery. Lumbar punctures remove excess fluid to reduce intracranial pressure. Surgery can be used to insert a shunt which diverts excess fluid to another part of the body. Many patients find their symptoms improve with treatment but they will require monitoring for the rest of their lives. Source: NHS Choices . He said: ‘Minocycline is an antibiotic which is used to treat acne. When categorising reactions to medication, we group them into “common”, “uncommon”, “rare” and “very rare”. ‘A reaction to Minocycline causing intracranial hypertension is considered to be rare. This reaction is reported in one in 1,000 to 10,000 patients. ‘All drugs have side effects and, in this, there are inherent risks. When prescribing drugs, the risks are explained. ‘Usually patients are given a patient information leaflet which comes with the medication itself. The leaflet lists a full range of possible reactions, including those which are unproved but suspected. ‘The healthcare professional, with the consent of the patient, will consider the risks and benefits when prescribing medication. ‘If a medication is thought to have a “rare” or “very rare” side effect, we keep an eye out for those side effects, but the risk is not considered great enough to prevent use. ‘As soon as such a reaction is suspected in a patient, I would advise the patient to stop using the medication immediately. ‘Intracranial hypertension means there is extra fluid or pressure in the brain. The brain is constrained within the “box” of the skull, so it can't expand very easily to accommodate this extra fluid or pressure. ‘Depending on how severe the reaction is, sometimes treatment is needed to bring the pressure or swelling down. ‘The treatment needs to be followed up once the medication is stopped to make sure that it is the drug causing the swelling, not anything else.’ Ms Yeo, who is not pursuing any claims . for compensation, has struggled to come to terms with the fact that her . life may never be the same again in the wake of the devastating . reaction. She said: ‘I'm with it for life. There is no cure, but the pressure on the brain can be regulated with lumbar punctures. Ms Yeo (pictured with a letter from her doctor) says she now hopes her symptoms will improve over time . ‘While I wait between procedures, I just have to suffer. With every lumbar puncture, there's a risk I'll lose some feeling in my legs, but it's a risk I have to take. ‘I'm on all sorts of different tablets to reduce the cerebral fluids but the sight loss might be irreversible. I can't drive and watching television is a struggle. I can't get glasses because my prescription could change from week to week. ‘Even though I've lost a lot, I could have lost so much more. I could have been completely blinded or I could have had a stroke or fallen into a coma. ‘At least I can still be a mum for Isabelle. Even though it's a struggle sometimes, I'm lucky that the reaction wasn't even more serious.’","Rachel Yeo, 26, was prescribed Minocycline in a bid to cure her acne .

The body of an Australian soldier who went missing more than two weeks ago while on holiday in the U.S. has been found near the top of a mountain in upstate New York. Captain Paul McKay, 31, was last seen walking down a train track on New Year’s Eve carrying a large backpack. Despite a huge search involving tracker dogs, helicopters and a team of volunteers, police were unable to trace him. Tragic loss: Captain Paul McKay was found dead on an American mountain earlier this week. He had been suffering from PTSD since returning from Afghanistan . His remains were finally found on Wednesday at 11am local time, around 150 metres from a trail on Scarface Mountain. The peak, which is 932 metres high, is a popular spot for hikers. ‘This is not the outcome we had hoped for,’ Saranac Lake police chief Bruce Nason told AAP on Thursday. Capt McKay, from Canberra, was reported missing on January 3 after his family became seriously concerned about his wellbeing. The soldier, who has been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), had sent an email to his father on December 30 leaving him all of his possessions. When police searched the Saranac Lake hotel where he had been staying, they found personal items including his camera and clothes. Remote: The soldier's body was found on Scarface Mountain, in upstate New York, a popular hiking trail . Capt McKay developed PTSD after returning from a tour of Afghanistan in 2011. At the time of his death, he was on leave from the Australian Army. His family were unaware that he was on holiday in the US. Just after he checked out is his hotel, the region was hit by very cold weather caused by a polar vortex, which led to snow storms and temperatures dropping below minus 30C. A New York forest ranger found the soldier’s body while climbing the mountain on Wednesday. Capt McKay body was covered only by a blanket and was found in a section of mountain hidden from search helicopters. The cause of death is unknown and an autopsy will be conducted on the body on Thursday but police say that there are no signs of foul play. ‘The family has been informed of this news and we express our deepest sympathy for their loss’, Chief Nason said.","Captain Paul McKay, 31, had gone on holiday in U.S. without telling family .

A 44-year-old Virginia man who couldn't even speak without gasping for breath is now breathing normally after having his lungs washed out with 30 liters of fluid. Robert Epperson, 44, was diagnosed late last year with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, or PAP, in which surfectant builds up in the air sacs of the lungs. The treatment is a procedure called lung lavage during which doctors washed his lungs, one at a time, with a saline solution. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Debilitating: Robert Epperson needed an oxygen tank to breathe and was constantly struggling for breath . Short of breath: Epperson's air sacs were filled with surfectant and a misdiagnosis of his condition meant that treatments were ineffective and sometimes harmful . Intubated: Epperson was breathing through one lung while the other was washed . Epperson had previously been diagnosed . with sarcoidosis, a disease that effects mainly the lungs and lymphatic . system, but treatments were ineffective and after yet another bout of . pneumonia he went steadily downhill. Finally, just before Thanksgiving 2013, he was found by doctors at the Clelveland Clinic to be suffering from PAP, a condition that's hard to diagnose and is often mistaken for sarcoidosis. According to Epperson's doctors, the initial  misdiagnosis of sarcoidosis was exacerbating his condition. The immune suppressant and anti-inflammatory drugs were in fact making him more susceptible to infection. After his most recent bout with pneumonia, Epperson found himself barely able to stand or speak without becoming winded. The engineer was still dragging himself to work every day but was surviving on oxygen tanks. 'I had absolutely no energy... During that time, I would go from my bed to my desk at work to bed,' he told ABC News. Specialized procedure: A doctor secures one of the many bags of fluid that was run through Epperson's clogged lungs . Good vibration: Epperson can be seen with a chest percussor strapped to him, which vibrated his chest as the fluid was pumped through them . 'Several people told me, after the fact, that they were not sure I would make it through. To quote my wife, ""I was on death’s doorstep.""' Epperson, a father of two boys aged 21 and 14, had given up on any activities outside of work and sleep. After doctors at the Cleveland Clinic diagnosed APA, Epperson underwent lung lavage, a treatment that's used exclusively for PAP. According to ABC News, Epperson was fitted with a chest percussor, a vest that shook his chest. Doctors intubated him, washing one lung at a time so that Epperson could breathe with the other one. The saline solution was pumping into his lungs, cleaning out the excess surfectant from his air sacs. Surfectant is protein and lipid material. 'Normal surfactant keeps the airways open,' Dr Basem Abdelmalak told ABC News. Life savers: Dr Basem Abdelmalak (left) performed the lung-washing procedure while Dr Jihane Faress (right) finally gave Epperson the correct diagnosis for his condition . First wash: One of the medical team drains fluid from Epperson's lung into a bottle . Fresh start: The first liters of liquid were cloudy with surfectant that had built up in Epperson's air sacs . 'The blood that comes through the thin walls exchange with the air and that’s how we get oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide. The altered surfactant protein makes this wall very thick, so the air doesn’t exchange well. There is a lack of oxygenation, and the patient becomes short of breath and fatigues quickly, and is barely able to leave the house.' Over the course of successive washes, the liquid slowly turned from cloudy, milky, off-white to clear. It took 30 liters of water to clean Epperson's lungs. The procedure can only be performed by a highly trained surgeon and a team made up of a radiologist, anesthesiologist and pathologist. Breathing easy: The fluid flushed through Epperson's lungs went from cloudy to clear as his air sacs were cleaned out . Family man: Epperson (pictured with his family) can start doing some of his favorite activities again, such as coaching kids sports . Epperson says the result was nothing short of a miracle. 'I had the lavage Thursday, and on Friday I felt well enough to drive myself home,' he told ABC. Epperson may go into complete remission from he disease, or he may require further lung-washing. The doctor who diagnosed Epperson's condition correctly, Dr Jihane Faress, is very hopeful for Epperson's future. 'He is a wonderful person,' she told ABC News. 'He was still going to work on a huge amount of oxygen and didn’t want to give up. ... There are days we [doctors] get discouraged dealing with very complex cases, but people like Robert give me hope and make me happy about what I am doing.'","Robert Epperson, 44, was diagnosed with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) after years of not being able to breathe .

Enter Leon Black's investment firm Apollo, which buys troubled companies using borrowed money and tries to sell them for more, usually years later, in a transaction known as a leveraged buyout. The companies say Apollo will pay $54 per share for CEC Entertainment Inc. That's about a 25 percent premium over CEC's closing price on Jan. 7, the last trading day before media speculation regarding a transaction, the companies noted.

The company, which announced on Thursday that it has adopted a shareholder rights plan, had been reviewing its strategic options. A shareholder rights plan, also known as a 'poison pill,' is commonly used by businesses to try to ward off hostile takeover attempts. CEC said its shareholder rights plan was implemented to help its board 'in overseeing a fair and orderly process' and to maximize shareholder value during a sale of the company. CEC said its rights plan won't prevent or restrict any person from making a superior bid. CEC and its franchisees run 577 Chuck. E.

She needed surgery on her nose following the violent attack at a pub in Leeds, West Yorkshire, that split her nostril in half on New Year 2010. A group of men attacked her and her boyfriend in a bar on New Year's Eve. She was rushed to hospital by ambulance before having 12 stitches to repair the damage. The then 21-year-old was left with a 4cm laceration to her nose and a nose stud she had been wearing was left embedded in the wound along with a piece of glass - which was stuck so deep it could only be detected by X-ray. Surgeons reattached her nostril and removed the glass that had become deeply embedded in her face. Alexandra, a journalism student from Otley, Leeds, had been out for a celebratory drink with friends in nearby Headingley when one of a group of drunken yobs swept a table filled with glasses directly at her face. She said: 'It felt like I had been punched in the face. My arm was covered in cuts from the glass and the next thing I knew my face was streaming with blood. 'It was everywhere, and I was hysterical, screaming ""He's broken my nose, he's broken my nose!"" The former Leeds University student said her self-confidence was shattered following the attack and she decided to enter pageants to re-build her self-esteem . 'I couldn't understand why there was . so much blood. I knew I hadn't been punched but there was so much blood, . it was just gushing from my face. I was covered in it. 'It was . only after the paramedics took me to A&E that my dad came and told . me that my nose had been sliced open on one side, from the front right . the way to the back. 'They couldn't operate on me that night and I had to go back the next day to have an operation under general anaesthetic. The former Leeds University student, who now works as an account executive, said her self-confidence had suffered after she was injured in the attack and she started to enter pageants to rebuild her self-esteem. Alexandra reached the finals of Miss Leeds in 2010, shortly after the attack. Alexandra will compete in the grand final in March with girls from all over the country. If she wins, the international final will be held in the USA this summer, representing England. She said: 'It's a kind of hobby for me. I'm proud of winning another title. Pageants are not only a fun and glamorous experience in which you get to represent your region, it's also a brilliant chance to inspire others and do charity work.' 'If I do happen to win my mother won't be too pleased if I have to go to the US as we have booked a big family holiday at the same time.'

With a fragile economic recovery to protect, rows over Europe to navigate, not to mention a looming general election, it is undeniable the new year presents David Cameron with a host of challenges. But last night the Prime Minister jokingly revealed that, in 2014, priority 'number one' is keeping a tight rein on his bald patch. In an address to political journalists at the Westminster Correspondents dinner, held last night at the House of Commons, Mr Cameron poked fun at his thinning hair while making jibes about Ed Balls, Boris Johnson and the rebel MPs within his party. Revealed: Mr Cameron's bald spot made an appearance in Parliament in February 2013 . He told the assembled journalists that he was ready to announce 'my priorities for the year ahead', before continuing 'number one - keeping the bald spot under control.' The fresh attention on the Prime Ministerial hairdo comes after the New Year's honours list featured Mr Cameron's hairdresser, Lino Carbosiero, who received an MBE for 'services to hairdressing'. Mr Carosiero, who cuts and styles the Prime Minister's hair for Â£90 a time and is held responsible for his trademark side-parting, came in for another round of praise last night, though Mr Cameron insisted he did not know about the award in advance. He said: 'If you can make cuts and . stop recession at the same time, you deserve an honour.' Mr Cameron's bald spot has been the subject of media speculation for some time. Bald patch 7 December 2005, left, and 5 October 2010, right . It has been photographed on occasion since he took over as the leader of the Conservative party in 2005, though it is often skilfully covered. The dinner at which Mr Cameron was speaking, held in the Members' dining room in the House of Commons, is a smaller-scale version of the White House Correspondents' dinner held by the President each year. It is the first to be held in 1974. Out again: Mr Cameron's hair on this visit in London in December 2011 . Commenting on his grand surroundings - and making a reference to his past as a member of the notorious Bullingdon Club while he was at Oxford, Mr Cameron said: 'The last time I was at a dinner this posh, Boris [Johnson] spent the rest of the night in prison.' He also recalled a tense moment out campaigning with Mr Johnson when a woman who answered the door seemed to accuse the London mayor of fathering her child. According to the Prime Minister, she said: ''Boris, you're the father of one of my children.' But she quickly revealed that it was a joke by clarifying: 'It's your daughter, I'm her maths teacher.' Mr Cameron also made light of troubles within his own party, saying that a rebellious letter sent to him by backbench MPs demanding the power to veto EU laws never actually materialised. He told his audience: 'The only problem was that there was no letter, they didn't send it and it didn't have 95 signatures'. However, one backbencher, Penny Mordaunt, came in for praise from the Prime Minister after she decided to appear on ITV's Splash!, hosted by Tom Daley, to raise money for charity. He said: 'If every Tory MP who's taken their clothes off in recent years had had such noble intentions, we would be in a much better position.' And, in an apparent spirit of generosity, Mr Cameron also took time to find common ground with one of his fiercest critics - Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls. Covered: Mr Cameron's bald patch is rarely visible. In a picture, left, taken in Germany in April he sports a full-looking head of hair, and appears similar hirsute meeting Barbara Windsor and a Remembrance Day event last November . He pointed out: 'We both love The Sound of Music, we both love Delia Smith - for different reasons - and we both like the Antiques Roadshow. 'I like it for the heartwarming stories, Ed likes it when they sell the family silver.' The Prime Minister finished his address by praising the 'tenacious... often uncomfortable' nature of the British Press, which he made clear is vital to preserve democracy. He said: 'At its best, the British press and the political press has a vital role to play in our country,' said the Prime Minister. 'Tenacious, uncontrollable, sceptical, often uncomfortable for us politicians, British political reporting is deservedly respected around the world for the way it probes, inquires and scrutinises. These things are lynchpins of our democracy.'","Mr Cameron addressed journalists last night in a light-hearted speech .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:23 EST, 16 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 12:38 EST, 16 January 2014 . An overweight mother has revealed she was inspired to shed six stone after suffering a humiliating wake-up call during a visit to the fairground. Lee Gentleman, 34, saw her weight rise to 15st after binging on an unhealthy diet of takeaways, crisps and chocolate. She finally realised she had to take action when she was unable to stretch a safety strap across herself and her four-year-old son during a family funfair trip. Shame: Lee with her son Oliver, then four, on holiday in Scarborough in 2012. It was then that Lee was humiliated at the fair when she could not fasten her seatbelt on a ride . Biggest: Lee says she was ashamed when she looked back at her holiday photos and found she was the fattest of all her family. Lee managed to lose 6st after joining Slimming World and turning her diet around . Now, a year later, Lee has managed to successfully turned her diet around and weighs just 9st 2lbs. She said: 'That summer was one of the worst I had ever had. 'I was at my heaviest point and we were in Scarborough for a family holiday. I went on a ride with my son but I couldn't get the seat belt around the two of us. 'I was totally embarrassed, it was a horrible situation. I was also looking back at pictures from when I went to Blackpool with my mum and cousins. I was the biggest in every single photo.' Lee, from Biggar, South Lanarkshire, joined Slimming World and quickly changed her diet and exercise habits after her embarrassing rollercoaster experience. She decided to change job, moving from a call centre to working in a shop in her hometown, which made her more active and allowed her to plan meals. Transformation: Lee says she can now run around after her children, Oliver six, and Calvin, three (pictured here with son Calvin, then two) Lee said: 'I went from just sitting there to constantly moving about and serving people which made a difference. 'Before, I never had fruit and if I had any veg it would be fried. I had a lot of takeaways, at least two a week. 'My husband and I used to love getting a huge donor kebab, with everything in it, between us. 'Now I can still have one Chinese a week, usually boiled rice with beef and black bean sauce. 'I hardly ever exercised before and I always made excuses but now I walk for miles with the dog. 'I take the kids out cycling once a week if the weather is all right and I've started playing tennis and badminton, as well as going swimming on a Sunday. 'It was easy to stick to and has made such a difference. Life in general has improved. I'm in my hometown now and I can plan things a lot more. Moderation: 'I used to have a lot of takeaways. Now I still have a Chinese once a week, but I'll have boiled rice with beef and black bean sauce,' says Lee . 'I used to get to the top of the stairs and be knackered and even bending down to tie my shoelaces was difficult. 'I love it now that I can put my feet up and paint my nails without having to get into an awkward position. I'm flexible now.' Lee's transformation has stunned husband Ian, 39, and sons Oliver, six, and three-year-old Calvin. Her change in appearance has been so dramatic that most of her friends have struggled to recognise her. She added: 'I feel amazing. I never imagined I would get down to the weight I am now. 'It is phenomenal. Sometimes I still feel like I'm big until I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror and realise it isn't a dream. 'I can run about after my kids and I don't feel like the biggest person at the school gates. 'I still go to classes every week. I wouldn't miss them for the world.'
