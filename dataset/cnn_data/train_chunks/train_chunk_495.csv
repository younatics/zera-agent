The underworld masterminds of one of Britain’s largest ever car cloning rackets made £1million selling stolen vehicles on the second-hand car market. Ashley Halstead, 40, and Timothy Ellor, 33, 'disguised' vehicles using legitimate details from similar models and hawked them online via Auto Trader and eBay, a Manchester court heard. Unsuspecting buyers duped by the elaborate scam answered adverts and bought the affordable cars, only to discover they had been stolen. Crooked pair: Timothy Ellor, left, and Ashley Halstead oversaw a criminal network of around 16 accomplices who posed as sellers and provided addresses where deals could take place . Police discovered Halstead and Ellor ran a network of criminals in 'three tiers.' The crooked pair 'managed' the list of stolen cars, while a sub-team posed as 'sellers' and a third allowed the stolen vehicles to be sold at their addresses. Each car had its number plates changed and new registration numbers used in adverts on market places so prospective buyers could make HPI checks. The gang also used blank V5 vehicle registration documents and blank road tax discs stolen from post offices, personal details of innocent people, forged MOT certificates, faked receipts of previous sales of the cars and even a bogus service history. Ben East, 37, whose Land Rover Freelander was stolen during a burglary at his home in Didsbury, Manchester, was shocked to find out it had been sold to innocent dairy farmer Adrian Bland who lives 150 miles in Cumbria. Mr Bland, 40, saw the car advertised on the Auto Trader website and went to see it at a house in Rochdale. He paid £11,500 for the Land Rover after innocently believing all the forged documentation to be genuine, including the vehicle identification number matching the chassis number in the windscreen. 'Too good to be true': Farmer Adrian Bland paid £11,500 for a stolen Land Rover he was on Auto Trader, believing the forged documents to be real . Detectives traced more than 60 cars valued at a total of £571,718, which had been stolen and cloned including BMWs, Audis, VWs and a Mitsubishi pick-up truck. Of these, 39 had been sold to innocent buyers, who paid a total of £280,000. Police estimate the racket earned the gang more than £1m. Halstead was today jailed for four years at Minshull Street Crown Court while Ellor was given two years and four months after they pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal and convert criminal property. Sixteen accomplices are due to be sentenced later. Father-of-two Mr Bland said after the case: 'I remember my wife saying at the time the price was too good to be true and she was right. But he said he had gone through a really bitter divorce and he didn’t want his wife finding out. 'He seemed genuine, I took the details of the registration and when I ran them passed the AA, they said it all appeared legitimate and above board. 'I had heard of people buying stolen cars at the pubs but we met this guy at what I thought was his home, so I didn’t question it. It was only when I sent the registration document to the DVLA I found out it had been stolen and cloned. Conned: Mr Bland checked the registration details with the AA and was told everything was above board . 'Police removed the spare wheel, the boot lining and showed me the chassis number that didn’t match the vehicle. I was absolutely furious and I felt so sick. 'I was livid that somebody had got one over me and that I had been so naive. Last year, I was employing a lad to work on the farm and since this, I’ve had to cut his hours and take on more hours myself - even though I already work a 12-hour day. I’ve had no choice financially.' Mr East, 37, a freelance journalist, said: 'I do feel sorry for the guy that bought it because I imagine on Auto Trader it looked like a great deal. 'We felt we couldn’t get the same car again because after it was stolen, what’s to stop them coming back thinking the same car would be there again. We were also really scared that we were being watched.' Police said Ellor, of Hyde, would be told a stolen car was 'available' so he knew the make, model and specification. Nightmare: The original owners of the cars, the buyers and the people whose identities were taken all suffered as a result of the villainous duo's greed . Victims: The Land Rover Freelander stolen from Ben East and sold to Mr Bland by the tricksters . Elaborate detail: A forged MoT certificate, left, and a forged vehicle registration document, right . He would then obtain the identities of similar models from a number of 'sources' including the internet, or even from cars he spotted on the street. He would then pass these identities on to others so the true identity of the car was disguised. Ellor also carried out car history checks by phone and put adverts on to online market places. Halstead, of Rochdale would be told about cars that had been stolen and was known to sell some of them on, for profit. Supt Neil Evans from Greater Manchester Police said: 'The tragedy here was that for every vehicle involved, there were numerous victims throughout the process. 'We have come across some tragic stories, such as victims of burglary who felt violated, people whose identities were hijacked, and those who saved up to buy the car that they needed, only to find themselves badly out of pocket. 'Today’s outcome is the culmination of a sensitive, large-scale and thoroughly planned police operation into an organised criminal network. In short, these people made money from burglaries. 'We urge prospective buyers of cars to always use bankers draft rather than cash, and we also want to make it clear that if a price looks too good to be true, there is every chance that it is.' Convincing fake: One of the stolen tax discs used to make the cars seem legitimate . Mark Angus, Senior Crown Prosecutor said: 'There were many victims of this gang - the owners who had their cars stolen and the innocent purchasers who bought the vehicles in good faith. 'These are serious crimes that have a significant impact on victims in all sorts of ways.' A spokesman from Auto Trader said: 'Buyers should approach all online purchases with caution and assure themselves that they have enough information about a seller to be confident in a transaction before they part with their money.' Kristian Welch, Consumer Director for HPI said: 'Sadly, the cloning of cars is a common practice used by organised crime groups to hide the identity of stolen vehicles.' A spokesman for CDL Vehicle Information Services (which owns MyCarCheck.com and MyTextCheck) said: 'The sums involved show that this was ‘big business’, highly organised crime. Demands for ‘cash only’ should always set the alarm bells ringing.'","Vehicles taken during house burglaries were 'disguised' as legitimate cars .

The 74-year-old mother of legendary baseball star Cal Ripken Jr was kidnapped by an armed man on Tuesday. Violet Ripken was forced from her Aberdeen, Maryland home at around 7am by the handgun-wielding thug who dragged her into her 1998 Lincoln Town Car and sped off. A manhunt for the pensioner and her attacker was launched by Aberdeen Police Department who described the case as a missing persons investigation. Distressing: Violet Ripken (centre) mother of Cal Ripken Jr (right) and his brother Bill (left) was abducted at gunpoint from her home . As they searched police in Baltimore County, Maryland got a call from an anonymous tipster about a suspicious vehicle. According to wbaltv.com the call came from a passer by who spotted Ms Ripken and her attacker in the back seat of his car where he had bundled her in, tied up. The unnamed source confronted the man who said Ms Ripken was his mother and that he was taking her to hospital. But the source wasn't convinced so called the police who contacted the Aberdeen department to suggest that the car might be linked to their investigation. For a terrifying 24 hours Ms Ripken's distressed family had no clue as to her whereabouts while police desperately looked for clues. She was eventually found at around 6am on Wednesday, bound and blindfolded in her car not far from her home. Police said she appeared unharmed but will undergo medical examination and be interviewed. For now she is resting in the care of family members who are relieved to have her back. 'This has been a very trying time for our family, but we are grateful and relieved that mom is back with us, safe and healthy,' said a statement released by the Ripken family.

A struggling clothes store has made a bold marketing move in an attempt to boost sales - by offering an 80% discount for shoppers who make purchases in their underwear. The Gran America emporium in Paraguay tempted clients with savings of up to 80 per cent - but only if they took their clothes off. The store, which sells clothes, perfumes and electrical products, made a normal month’s takings in just a few hours as over 100 men and women stripped off to shop. Naked ambition: The Paraguayan store offered a huge discount as long as customers turned up in underwear, similar to this promotion in Spain alst year . As a result the promotion, which was expected to last an hour, was extended for the whole of the day on Saturday. Henry Martins, sales manager of the shop in Cuidad del Este on the border with Brazil, told Paraguay’s Vanguardia newspaper that sales had plummeted after Brazil recently tightened customs controls. He said: 'It was either come up with something creative or go bust. At first we wanted people to go completely naked but realised I could have got into trouble with the law. 'It was a great success. We had people in their underwear taking advantage of the promotion, and lots more coming in to get an eyeful. 'I’ve never seen the shop so full. We’re already planning our next one.' The concept of offering customers discounted items for turning up without clothes is not a new idea in the retail world. Earlier this year, Spanish retailer Desigual offered customers free clothes if they turned up at their Madrid store in just their underwear.","Gran America store in Paraguay offers huge discounts for scantily-clad customers .

A British company has agreed to pay millions of pounds in compensation to an Australian woman who was born without arms and legs after her mother took Thalidomide during her pregnancy. The landmark case is expected to result in thousands of other victims of the drug around the world winning huge claims against British pharmaceutical company Diageo and German firm Grunenthal. Lynette Rowe, 50, was born in 1962 at the peak of the birth defect epidemic. Emotional: Lynette Rowe, who was born without arms and legs in 1962, has tears wiped from her eyes by her mother Wendy at a press conference in Melbourne today. She has won a multi-million pound payout against a British drug firm after her mother took Thalidomide during her pregnancy . Victory: Miss Rowe, her mother and her legal team leave the Supreme Court in Melbourne today . Her lawyer Peter Gordon today hailed her multi-million pound award as a major victory against Diageo, whose parent company Distillers distributed the drug that was made by Grunenthal. Grunenthal was not included in the . settlement at the Victorian Supreme Court in Melbourne, but Mr Gordon said she would be leading a class . action against that company also. He said: 'Lynny might not have arms or legs but she has struck a blow for other Thalidomiders around the world.' Mr Gordon told the court that a damages settlement had been reached between Miss Rowe and the British company, but details of the pay-out would remain confidential. He said: ‘This win will ease her financial plight for the rest of her life, but she is determined to remain as the lead plaintiff to help other thalidomide victims. ‘The sum she will receive reflects the trauma and expense of surviving 50 years with no arms or legs. It is more than adequate to compensate her for the future. Miss Rowe as a young girl in 1969. A damages settlement had been reached with pharmaceutical firm Diageo, but details of the pay-out remain confidential . Half a century ago: Miss Rowe shortly after her birth in 1962 with her sisters Marilyn (left) and Alison (right) Pregnant women were prescribed the drug in the 1950s and 1960s as a treatment for morning sickness or insomnia. It was withdrawn from sale in 1961 after babies were born with limb deformities and other damage. The drug's UK manufacturer, Distillers Biochemicals, paid around . £28million compensation in the 1970s following a legal battle by the . families of those affected. In January 2010, the Government finally apologised, expressing its 'sincere regret and deep sympathy' to the victims of the thalidomide scandal. Then Health Minister Mike O'Brien made the formal apology in a statement to MPs. Mr O'Brien also confirmed a £20million support package, announced the previous month, which would be administered through the Thalidomide Trust to help meet the needs of survivors. ‘She needs constant care 24 hours a day for the rest of her life. Thalidomide was the greatest pharmaceutical disaster in history.’ The timing of the win comes in a . significant week for Miss Rowe, who has just moved into a new house . built for her in Melbourne by an army of volunteer tradesmen, aided by . donations from businessmen and a law firm. It . is now expected that Thalidomide victims in Britain, North America, New . Zealand and a number of other countries will find encouragement in . their pursuit of damages as a result of their mothers taking the . anti-nausea drug during their pregnancies. More . than 10,000 children born to mothers who took the drug were born with . varying degrees of deformities, including missing fingers and toes, . while the more serious victims such as Miss Rowe came into the world . with whole limbs missing. Miss Rowe wept outside the court as her father, Ian, spoke on her behalf. 'The things she has achieved are absolutely amazing,’ he said. 'You don’t need arms and legs to change the world.’ Mr Gordon added that everyone who knew Miss Rowe was ‘very proud’ of her and he said her parents, Wendy and Ian, also deserved praise for the care they had shown as she struggled on despite her disability. Miss Rowe’s mother, who is now in her late 70s, was told after her limbless daughter was born that a virus had caused the deformities. But Mrs Rowe said she did not hold a grudge against the doctor who gave her Thalidomide for morning sickness in 1961. ‘We blamed the companies that made the drug and sold it without testing it properly,’ she told Melbourne’s Herald Sun newspaper.","Lynette Rowe, 50, was born in 1962 at the peak of the birth defect epidemic .

Pictured, the type and size of rock that would have been used to stone them to death . A couple accused of engaging in extramarital affairs have been stoned to death by an Islamic militant group in control of northern Mali. The young pair were publicly executed in the remote town of Aguelhok, near the vast West African nation's northern border with Algeria, on Sunday, a spokesman for the Ansar Dine ('defenders of the faith') group said. 'These two people were married and had extra-conjugal relations. 'Our men on the ground in Aguelhok applied sharia [Islamic law],' Sanda Ould Bounama said on Monday. 'They both died right away and even asked for this application. 'We don't have to answer to anyone over the application of sharia,' he said. Most people living in northern Mali have long practised Islam, but frustrations with the strict form of sharia being imposed by Islamists have sparked several protests in recent months. Ansar Dine and well-armed allies, including Al Qaeda splinter group Mujwa, have hijacked a separatist uprising by local Tuareg rebels and now control two-thirds of north Mali's desert - including Gao, Kidal and Timbuktu.

Tony Blair was lambasted by MPs today for failing to answer their questions on the Freedom of Information Act, even though he was the law's architect. The former Prime Minister called the act 'one of the greatest mistakes I made in office' and now refused to appear before the Commons justice select committee to discuss it, it was revealed today. FOI allows any person in Britain to request information from public bodies. Sir Alan Beith, the committee's chairman, said Mr Blair was given every chance to give evidence at a convenient time but only answered written questions after a press report suggested they would be critical of his non-appearance. 'We deplore Mr Blair’s failure to cooperate with a committee of the House, despite being given every opportunity to attend at a time convenient to him,' Sir Alan said . Their new report made no major recommendations to reduce the openness created by the Freedom of Information laws and did not recommend fees should be brought in to recoup the costs of answering requests. But its findings were finalised before the MPs received a letter from Mr Blair, who came up with the idea of the Act as prime minister, saying that it undermined discussions at the highest levels of government. Sir Alan said: 'Former prime minister Tony Blair described himself as a ""nincompoop"" for his role in the legislation, saying that it was ""antithetical to sensible government"". 'Yet when we sought to question Mr Blair on his change of opinion he refused to defend his views before us and submitted answers to our written questions only after our report was agreed, and after a press report had appeared, suggesting we might criticise his failure to give evidence.' No show: Mr Blair sent written responses to questions rather than appear in Parliament . The report said the existing legislation already intended to provide a 'safe space' for policy-making in which ministers could be given frank advice by officials and this should be respected by everyone. Ministerial vetoes would, from time to time, need to be used to protect this space, the report added. It said the 'potential risks of a chilling effect - if it is a reality - go beyond a bowdlerising or editing of the records'. 'It is that no record exists, because ministers may avoid holding formal meetings entirely,' the committee said. Appearance: Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair gave evidence to the Iraq War Inquiry, pictured, but would not appear before the Justice committee . But research by the Constitution Unit found the 'chilling effect' of FOI laws appeared “negligible to marginal”, despite the concerns raised by former senior ministers and officials. Retired Cabinet Secretary Lord O’Donnell told the MPs that ministers and officials 'are going to find ways around it, things are not going to be written down' and the cost of ministers’ mobile phone bills will rise. 'That, to me, makes for worse government and it makes it impossible for (historians) to try to recreate accurately what has gone on when there are no records,' he warned. The MPs’ report concluded: 'Given the uncertainty of the evidence we do not recommend any major diminution of the openness created by the Freedom of Information Act. 'But, given the clear intention of Parliament in passing the legislation that it should allow a ‘safe space’ for policy formation and Cabinet discussion, we remind everyone involved in both using and determining that space that the Act was intended to protect high-level policy discussions. The Freedom of Information Act was passed in November 2000, three years after Tony Blair, its architect, first became Prime Minister. It came into force in January 2005, giving the public a right to access all types of recorded information held by taxpayer-funded authorities and organisations. These include government departments, councils and the BBC. There are certain exceptions allowed to be used to prevent some information being released. These include if it would cost too much to collate, it is not in the public interest to publish or is a matter of national security. 'We also recognise that the realities of government mean that the ministerial veto will have to be used from time to time to protect that space.' The report also called for higher fines for the destruction of information, along with changes to protect universities from having to disclose research before the paper has been published. Dr Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group, backed the report, saying that if research data was not exempt from FOI legislation 'then we are in real danger of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs'. 'Openness and transparency must have limitations in order to protect our national interests, including national security and the safety of our researchers.' Nick Pickles, director of the civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, added: 'Access to information is an essential part of holding government to account. 'As the committee has found, the Act already protects sensitive discussions and those seeking to restore a veil of secrecy to decision making should not be allowed to stem the flow of information, by charging or limiting the scope of the Act. A spokesman for Mr Blair’s office said he had submitted written evidence to the committee in response to its questions.","The former PM wouldn't come before the Commons' justice committee .

A road safety campaigner appeared in court yesterday after a car was driven into his family home with his estranged wife and three children inside. Andrew McGarry was charged with arson with intent to endanger life and breaching a non-molestation order after claims the Vauxhall Zafira may have been deliberately rammed through the front wall of the property on Tuesday. The 37-year-old architect, who is believed to have got out of the blue vehicle before it caught fire, was remanded in custody at Bolton Magistrates' Court. The Vauxhall Zafira, reportedly driven by McGarry, burst into flames after slamming into the house in Horwich, Bolton . At the time of the 7am incident, . McGarry’s estranged wife Heather, 27, and three children believed to be . two boys and a girl aged between two and six were inside the £100,000 . house and were woken by the impact of the crash. They all escaped uninjured. Police and firefighters arrived at the scene in Horwich, near Bolton, Greater Manchester to find the car embedded in the house and engulfed in a ball of flames. Although four people were believed to have been inside the house when the incident took place, the family managed to escape unhurt . McGarry was remanded in custody and is due to appear at Bolton Crown Court in August 10 in relation to the incident . Greater Manchester Police said McGarry was arrested near to the scene of the crash. The 37-year-old had previously fought for better road safety on the street after his daughter Lacey was knocked down by a car two years ago. As a result, mobile speed checks were . carried out on the busy road last year. In an interview with his local . paper McGarry said: 'I get really emotional when I talk about what . happened to Lacey, and I am just so glad she is still here.' McGarry's wife and family were taken in by a neighbour whilst firefighters tackled the blaze at their home . Police are now investigating whether the car was driven at the house deliberately and then set on fire afterwards - or whether the vehicle caught fire as a result of the impact. An officer stood guard at the house which had been damaged by the fire. The remains of the front wall were piled up in front of the lounge window which had been shattered by the force of the impact. One neighbour said: 'It was about 7am when I heard a loud bang and I went out to see what happened from my front door. I could see the car had collided with the wall and there was smoke and flames everywhere. Scene of investigation: The car was driven into the family home and exploded - no-one inside the property was hurt . 'The next thing we knew was there were police everywhere and a police helicopter flying around. If one of those kiddies had been in the front room we could have been looking at a fatality.' Another neighbour said: 'There was a large bang and I came out and saw flames coming out of the front window. Quite a few people came out too. 'I only moved here in November last year and knew that a woman lived there with three kids and partner. They must have only recently split up because i thought I’d seen them together. 'I’d never heard anything untowards coming from the house or an shouting or disturbances. The children are all very small, I think two are at a nursery and one at primary school.' Wrecked: Police and firefighters arrived at the scene in Horwich, near Bolton, Greater Manchester to find the car embedded in the house and engulfed in a ball of flame . A police spokesman said: 'Shortly after 7.05am on Tuesday 24 July 2012, police were called to Victoria Road in Horwich following a report that a car had collided with the front of a house. 'Police officers and firefighters attended and found that a Vauxhall Zafira had collided with the house and was on fire. 'Three children and a woman were inside the house at the time of the incident but were not injured. A joint investigation is being carried out by police and Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service to look into the circumstances surrounding the fire.' 'A 37-year-old man (was) taken into police custody for questioning.' Roads were closed temporarily whilst forensic officers examined the scene. The incident occurred after McGarry who runs his own design and architect practice campaigned for better road safety in his area after his daughter Lacey - then aged two years old - was knocked down by a car outside their home in September 2010. Crime scene: An officer stood guard at the house the front of which had been badly damaged by fire . She survived the impact and made a full recovery but Mr McGarry collected a petition with more than 200 signatures and raised £500 towards a survey to examine better speed restrictions in the area. Speaking to his local paper, Mr McGarry also said: 'I want to thank everyone who is supporting me. The roads will be a lot safer if people are reminded about the 30mph speed limit and how to spot it. 'On roads that have a lot of pedestrians and houses on each side, children can just run out into the road like my daughter did. 'If the driver is doing more than 30 mph, it can be difficult for them to stop and there can be a serious accident.' McGarry set up Facebook and Twitter pages for his firm based at the house but gave no inkling of any troubles at home - posting messages instead about his work designing loft and garage conversions.

The death of South America's liberation hero Simon Bolivar could have been hastened by arsenic and blister beetle venom, according to a fresh post-mortem to mark his 229th birthday. The findings come after Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez ordered the 19th century revolutionary leader's bones exhumed and examined to test his theory that Bolivar was assassinated. It was announced as Chavez and a group of schoolchildren unveiled a new 3D image of Bolivar, which a team of researchers produced based on studies of Bolivar's remains. National hero: Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez unveils a photograph-like portrait of Venezuela's independence hero Simon Bolivar on the 229th anniversary of Bolivar's birth . The socialist leader reveres Bolivar and has wrapped his left-wing reforms in the imagery and language of the region's battle to break free of colonial power Spain. 'He was a true giant of the human cause, the human battle ... this is his face,' Chavez said, sitting below two giant prints of a life-like depiction of a distinguished-looking Bolivar boasting a gold-braided uniform and prominent sideburns. 'Now we know with precision and receive with infinite intensity the luminous presence of this gaze, this living face.' The big reveal did not offer much in the way of surprise. With his high forehead and aquiline nose, the latest image shows that contemporary artists got Bolivar's face pretty much right. Bolivar is a figure of reverence in Latin America, where he helped to free Venezuela, Colombia, Peru and, of course, Bolivia from the Spanish colonial yoke. But in his 13 years as Venezuelan president, Chavez has strived to turn Venezuelan-born Bolivar into a cult figure. One of his first acts on becoming president in 1999 was to push through a new constitution that changed the country's name to The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Since then Chavez has normally given televised speeches in front of large paintings of Bolivar, a brilliant soldier and military tactician who led independence forces against the Spanish across the region, and ordered a striking new mausoleum built for Bolivar's remains, which will be finished soon. Revolutionary figure: Chavez and a group of schoolchildren unveiled a new 3D image of Bolivar, which a team of researchers produced based on studies of Bolivar's remains . Venezuela's opposition accuses the president of cynically seeking to boost his popularity by linking himself to Bolivar. Right-wingers accuse Chavez of being an autocrat who carefully avoids quoting some of Bolivar's words on freedom and rights. Chavez denies it and cites Bolivar as the inspiration for his leftist policies. He has long suggested Bolivar was poisoned by enemies in Colombia, rejecting the more common version cited by historians that he died of tuberculosis there in 1830, aged just 47. Two years ago, amid unusual scenes of a military honour guard in white biohazard suits and face masks exhuming the remains during a pre-dawn ceremony at the National Pantheon, the president assigned a team to investigate Bolivar's death. Revered: Bolivar helped to free Venezuela, Colombia, Peru and Bolivia from Spanish colonial rule but died aged just 47 in 1830 . A year ago, it reported back that 'the Liberator' may have died of accidental poisoning - probably as a result of taking toxic medicines that were widely used at the time. They did not rule out tuberculosis. On Tuesday, scientists said they did not find any evidence of pulmonary tuberculosis, the Miami Herald reported, but they warned that the samples were degraded and findings inconclusive. The investigation did however turn up traces of arsenic and venom from lytta vesicatoria, or blister beetle, according to Yanuacelis Cruz, one of the medical researchers. Both were common remedies for respiratory illnesses at the time, she added. Nevertheless, Chavez has not abandoned his theory that Bolivar was murdered by enemies loyal to the Spanish throne. After the scientist heading the 3D image project explained how it had been created using multiple scans and the latest forensic facial reconstruction methods, Chavez said Venezuelans were jubilant to see Bolivar's 'real face' at last. 'And not just in Venezuela, but in all the countries of Latin America, the Caribbean and further afield,' he said. 'I believe Bolivar is born again every day in every one of us, in these people, in these children ... in the fight for the fatherland which never ends.' A few blocks away from the Miraflores presidential palace, a crowd of red-clad Chavez supporters cheered and sang happy birthday as two giant canvases bearing the picture were unfurled on the face of a grand theatre. The new picture and birth certificate are not the only events to mark Bolivar's birthday. The Venezuelan government also hopes to soon inaugurate a long-delayed new mausoleum for the independence hero. The towering 160ft white structure in downtown Caracas is not quite yet finished, but it will soon be the resting place for the bones of Bolivar, which since 1876 had been kept along with those of another 100 Venezuelan national heroes and heroines in the adjacent National Pantheon. Its construction has been delayed, shrouded in secrecy and alternately hailed as fit for a hero of Bolivar's historical grandeur and criticised as an exaggerated reflection of Chavez's own ego. Its solemn black granite-floored interior is ready, but the surrounding plaza is not. Workers have been toiling day and night in recent weeks, laying patio tiles, wiring lamps, landscaping and molding concrete steps. Chavez shows the pistols of independence hero Simon Bolivar during a ceremony to mark the his birthday . Critics have called the expensive memorial, thought to have cost more than £74million, a waste of money, while some critics have likened its sloping walls to a skate park and said it denigrates the National Pantheon. But others believe Venezuelans deserve a towering monument. 'I don't think it's exaggerated at all,' said Isis Berroteran, a 47-year-old housewife from the west-central town of Cagua as she admired it from her car. 'The Pantheon, although spectacular, had become pretty small as the city grew.' Elias Pino, a historian and leading expert on Bolivar, considers the mausoleum Chavez's way of deepening his own identification in people's minds with the national hero. 'The political intent is that President Hugo Chavez be proclaimed the agent of Bolivar's will and interpreter of the gospel of Bolivar,' he said. 'This monument will tie together both figures,' he said, 'and will not just be the mausoleum of Bolivar but also the entrance of President Chavez into the pantheon of patriots.' Adulation of Bolivar transcends both sides of Venezuela's polarized pre-vote politics. Chavez's election rival, state governor Henrique Capriles, began Tuesday by tweeting a string of inspirational Bolivar quotes from his @hcapriles account. But in a speech later that day, he said: 'This government prefers to build a mausoleum to the Liberator rather than honor his memory, . 'The best way to honor his legacy is solving the problems of the nation.'","Independence hero Bolivar had been thought to have died of tuberculosis .

"By . Louise Boyle . PUBLISHED: . 17:43 EST, 30 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:35 EST, 1 August 2012 . A staff writer for The New Yorker has resigned and sales of his latest book suspended after he admitted to inventing quotes by Bob Dylan. Jonah Lehrer released a statement today through his publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt saying that some Dylan quotes which appeared in his book, Imagine: How Creativity Works, did 'not exist'. Others were 'unintentional misquotations, or represented improper combinations of previously existing quotes'. It Ain't Me Babe: Author Jonah Lehrer (right) resigned from his staff job at The New Yorker after he made up Bob Dylan quotes for his latest book . Lehrer said he acknowledged his actions after being contacted by Michael Moynihan of the online publication Tablet Magazine. Earlier today Tablet released an in-depth story on the Dylan passages in Imagine. In his statement, Lehrer wrote: 'I told Mr. Moynihan that they [the quotes in question] were from archival interview footage provided to me by Dylan's representatives. 'This was a lie spoken in a moment of panic. When Mr. Moynihan followed up, I continued to lie, and say things I should not have said. 'The lies are over now. I understand the gravity of my position. I want to apologize to everyone I have let down, especially my editors and readers.' On his Twitter account, Moynihan responded: 'Jonah Lehrer has resigned from the New Yorker and apologized to me. Not that this matters, but I accept his apology and wish him luck.' Among Lehrer's inventions was a quote . that first appeared in the famous documentary from the mid-1960s, Don't . Look Back, in which Dylan told a reporter about his songs: 'I just . write them. There's no great message.' In Imagine, Lehrer adds a third sentence - 'Stop asking me to explain' - that does not appear in the film. Inaccuracy: Lehrer admitted that he had used quotes by Dylan that did not exist in his new book . According to Tablet, Lehrer also . invented quotes on how Dylan wrote Like a Rolling Stone and, when . confronted about them, alleged that he had been granted access to an . uncut version of No Direction Home, a Dylan documentary made by Martin . Scorsese. Lehrer has now admitted he never saw such footage. Publisher Houghton Mifflin said in a statement that Lehrer had committed a 'serious misuse'. Listings for the e-book edition of Imagine will be removed and shipments of the physical book have been stopped. The book was published in March and had been selling well, ranking No.105 on Amazon.com today. Amazon had cited the book among the best March releases. A spokesman for Dylan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Canceled books inevitably lead to calls for publishers to fact-check releases. However publishers said the time and expense of reviewing thousands of texts, on a vast range of subjects, makes the process impractical. Jonah Lehrer, 31, graduated from Columbia University in 2003 with a major in neuroscience. He went on to study literature and philosophy at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar. Along with the ill-fated Imagine: How Creativity Works, published earlier this year, he is also the author of two other books -  Proust Was a Neuroscientist in 2007 and How We Decide two years later. Along with The New Yorker, he has written for Grantland, Nature, Seed, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and The Boston Globe. 'Publishing books is fundamentally different from publishing a newspaper or magazine,' Houghton Mifflin said in a statement. 'We rely on the authors' contractual warranties that the work is original and, for non-fiction, accurate. 'Nonetheless we consider accuracy and originality to be essential standards, and whenever any of our authors transgresses these standards we take it very seriously.' Lehrer, 31, was once a rising star at The New Yorker, which is famous for its thorough fact checking. The writer was already in trouble with the magazine after he acknowledged last month that he had recycled passages he had written for previous publications. Some recycled passages also appeared in Imagine, the latest of three books by Lehrer who is known for his explorations of science and literature and how the mind works. New Yorker Editor David Remnick said: 'This is a terrifically sad situation, but, in the end, what is most important is the integrity of what we publish and what we stand for.' Dylan himself has been challenged about his use of material. His album Modern Times included lines lifted from blues songs and from the Civil War poet Henry Timrod. An exhibition of paintings by the rock star turned out to contain images from other sources.

A convicted child rapist sexually assaulted a 12-year-old girl after spiking her Fruit Shoot drink with vodka while on bail for another sex attack on a youngster. Twisted Samuel Omar, 64, was given the opportunity to offend again after his court case for a vile attack on a young girl was delayed because of government funding cutbacks. The paedophile had been due to stand trial in May for sexually abusing a 10-year-old girl last July and superimposing her face onto pictures of topless models. But his case was adjourned until June 12 this year after Ministry of Justice spending cuts reduced the number of trials sitting at Northampton Crown . Court. Depraved: Convicted Child rapist Samuel Omar (left) sexually assaulted a 12-year-old girl after spiking her Fruit Shoot drink (right, file picture) with vodka while on bail for another sex attack on a youngster . Despite Omar, from Semilong, Northamptonshire, previously serving a 12-year prison sentence for raping a six-year-old girl in 1987, he was allowed out on bail after being charged with the sexual assault. The delay in his trial gave Omar the chance to strike again and four days before he was due back in court he spiked a 12-year-old girl's Fruit Shoot drink with vodka before sexually abusing her. Last Friday, he was finally jailed after he admitted the two sexual assaults and making indecent images of children. He was sentenced indefinitely to imprisonment for public protection and must serve a minimum of three years and three months before being considered for parole. Judge Sylvia De Bertodano told him: 'That does not mean you will be released then. 'You will only be released once a determination has been made you are no longer dangerous and that may be a very long time indeed.' July 2011: Family of 10-year-old girl make complaint to police about Samuel Omar . August 8: Charged with sexual assault . August 24: First appears before Northampton magistrates and granted conditional bail . October 5: Appears again before Northampton magistrates and granted conditional bail as case is sent to crown court . October 31: Appears at Northampton Crown Court and pleads not guilty of sex assault . June 9, 2012: He is arrested on suspicion of sexually assaulting a 12 year old girl . June 11: Breach of bail hearing at Hatfield Magistrates and remanded in custody . June 12: Appears at Northampton Crown Court, above, and pleads guilty to two sexual assaults and making indecent images of children . July 20: Jailed indefinitely for public protection . Children's charities blasted the decision to release Omar on bail in the first place. The Ministry of Justice also waded into the debate today by telling MailOnline that dangerous offenders 'should always be remanded into custody' while awaiting trial. Peter Bradley, Deputy Director of Kidscape, said: 'This is a horrific and worrying case of sexual abuse. 'Not only is Omar a dangerous paedophile whose rehabilitation was not effective, but also the system that is designed to protect children has clearly failed. 'The apparent failure of effective management of this case is partially to blame for the harm the girls and their families have suffered. 'There are many questions which need to be answered if the public are to have faith in the safeguarding system. 'I am particularly concerned that cutbacks in the number of trials at Crown Courts is allowing dangerous offenders to have extended access to the public and risk further assaults.' Jon Brown, Head of the NSPCC's Sexual Abuse programme said: 'As this man was a convicted child rapist serious consideration should have been given to keeping him in custody. 'He had already proved a risk to children and this should have been taken into account when he appeared in court to face this new charge. 'There are always various matters to be considered when someone is given bail but protection of children should always be the priority.' The court heard Omar was arrested in July last year when a 10-year-old told police he regularly touched and kissed her when alone. Shockingly, despite his earlier conviction for child rape, he was granted bail by magistrates in Northampton and ordered to stand trial in May. But when his trial was adjourned as a result of a cluttered court timetable, he targeted a 12-year-old in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. James McLernon, prosecuting, told the court: 'While on bail for the Northampton offence and a week before his re-listed trial, the defendant sexually assaulted another victim. 'On Saturday, June 9, an ambulance was called to her address where she was extremely intoxicated. 'Paramedics arrived and the defendant tried to drive away, but the ambulance blocked him in. 'She was incoherent and extremely distressed. Paramedics arrived and the defendant tried to drive away, but the ambulance blocked him in. She was incoherent and extremely distressed.' Officers discovered the girl's Fruit Shoot drink had been topped up with vodka. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: 'Dangerous offenders who pose a threat to society should always be remanded into custody while they await trial. 'The decision to grant bail is taken by the police and courts based on the full facts of each case. 'The overwhelming majority of people bailed do not reoffend and are often given strict conditions such as electronic tags and curfews. 'Anyone who reoffends while on bail will usually receive a longer sentence as a result.'","Depraved Samuel Omar, 64, was due to stand trial for sexually abusing child .

In the dock: An artist's drawing of Symieon Robinson-Pierre, during his appearance at Inner London Crown Court . A scene where five police officers were savaged by a pitbull was described as like the 'sickbay after the Battle of Trafalgar' as the case against the dog's owner went before a judge today . As the crazed dog mauled officers in a frenzied half-hour attack, its owner and a friend stood by and did nothing, telling them instead: 'You should have just knocked on the door', a court was told. Symieon Robinson-Pierre allegedly ignored . requests to call the dog off and instead went . back into a house with a friend and said: 'Mate, there’s nothing we can do'. The pitbull was eventually killed with four blasts from a shotgun - but not before . inflicting severe hand, arm and leg wounds, Inner London . Crown Court heard. The powerful dog, which weighed 29kg, pounced on police after officers went to the house in Stratford, east London. It clamped its teeth into one officer’s upper thigh and tried to drag him to the ground as another policeman repeatedly hit it in the head with a metal battering ram - but his actions made no difference. When he eventually prised the animal’s . jaws open with his baton, the dog turned on him grabbing hold of his . right forearm and then attacked other police in the front garden. It was then Robinson-Pierre and another man appeared at the front door, Inner London Crown Court heard. Prosecutor Sam Brown said: 'One of the men answered with words to the effect of ""we can’t, mate there’s nothing we can do"". Violence: The dog's blood spatters the road after police shot the frenzied pitbull, who had inflicted severe injuries on officers in a half-hour attack . Extreme measures: The dog was killed with four blasts from a shotgun after inflicting hand, arm and leg wounds on the five officers . 'One of the men then said in a tone that was utterly sanguine, ""you should have just knocked on the door"". 'After these vignettes were uttered the two men turned around, went back into the house closing no doubt what was left of the front door behind them'. Amateur video footage of the attack showed police clambering onto a narrow wall to try and escape the crazed dog, with the mauling only ending when a police marksman killed the animal with four shots. The jury heard the dog left behind a scene of 'carnage' in the terraced street. Mr Brown said: 'If you need a useful image in mind of the aftermath of this event, imagine the sickbay after the Battle of Trafalgar and that will give idea - carnage.' Victims (from l-r): PC's Marc Merritt, Lee Bush and Martin Corderon, who were among those, on their way to give evidence against Robinson-Pierre . Robinson-Pierre, 25, denies four counts of being owner of a dog which caused injury whilst it was dangerously out of control in a public place. The charges relate to the dog attack on Pc Marc Merritt, Pc Lee Bush, Pc Paul Garrard and Pc Steve Bones who were either attacked in the front garden or in the street as they tried to get the animal off their colleagues on March 22 of this year. He is not being prosecuted for the initial attack on Pc Martin Corderoy as it happened inside the house. Mr Brown told the jury: 'This case concerns a horrifying episode in central London this year borne out of a criminal failure by a dog owner to firstly realise the risk his animal posed and secondly to be in a position because of that failure to properly restrain it. 'Through no fault of the animal’s, its natural instinct manifested themselves in a terrifying display causing injury. 'No allegation is made that this defendant set his dog on these officers otherwise he would be facing very different charges. 'However, the conditions in which the dog was kept - the type of premises - the behaviour of the dog towards police officers in the house, and the defendant’s own attitude towards persons being attacked outside, are all matters that you will want to consider when listening to the evidence in this case.' 'It was bolting down the stairs, posing aggressively, baring its teeth but not growling or barking' Police had been at the property to execute a search warrant and had forced their way through the front door, the court heard. Mr Brown said: ‘Officers entered and identified themselves loudly, as one would expect them to do as police officers. ‘There was silence and darkness. The officers that had entered the premises began searching it, going from room to room. ‘Time passed without incident, when out of the silence was suddenly heard the sound of rapid scratching. ‘The cause of that scratching noise . was a dog of the pit bull type, one that I’m sure you are familiar with - . a powerfully built dog. ‘It was that was bolting down the stairs, posing aggressively, baring its teeth but not in fact growling or barking.’ The dog first attacked PC Corderoy, before setting on PC Merritt and causing him to run screaming into the street, the court heard. PC Bush freed Merritt, but as he shut the gate the dog leapt at him, continuing to attack as he sought refuge in a police van. Another officer, PC Paul Garrard, leapt on a garden wall to get out of the way but was grabbed by the ankle. Despite banging the dog’s head in a door PC Garrard only escaped when he leapt on a car bonnet. Others attempted to tackle the dog with riot shields, a fire extinguisher and batons but failed to subdue it. Pc Bones’ grabbed the dog’s throat to push it down but had his hand and fingers repeatedly bitten before it was eventually restrained  with a riot shield and a noose. Mr Brown said: 'For the first time it would appear the dog was under control. But only it would seem through exhaustion. At around this point an armed police unit had been summoned. ‘It was clearly not the declared . intention for serious harm of suffering to be inflicted on the animal, . however no specialist dog unit had arrived and the men restraining the . dog were either injured or losing their strength from holding it down. ‘Indeed, no officer could be sure that the noose around it neck was or was going to be effective.’ A firearms officer armed with a shotgun then shot the dog three times but it still struggled before a final shot to the head stopped it. He said all the officers that were bitten had to have surgery to 'repair the wounds to their bodies'. Mr Brown added: ‘No allegation is made that this defendant set his dog on the officers, otherwise he would be facing different charges. ‘However, the conditions in which the dog was kept, the behaviour of the dog towards the police officers in the house, and the defendant’s own attitude towards persons being attacked, are all matters that you will want to consider when listening to the evidence in the case.’ Robinson-Pierre, of Stratford, east London, denies four counts of owning a dog that was dangerously out of control in public.

The war over chicken sandwiches escalated today as gay rights advocates revealed plans for a 'Same Sex Kiss Day' at Chick-fil-A to counter the hundreds of thousands of people who lined drive-through lanes and filled dining rooms at the restaurants across the nation on Wednesday. The fast food chain said it enjoyed record-setting sales thanks to 'Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day,' which seemed to achieve its goal of backing the company's 'Christian principles' by asking supporters to vote with their feet and their dollars. Liberal groups are furious at the fast food chain after CEO Dan Cathy was quoted as saying he supports the 'biblical definition of marriage' and that the United States was 'inviting God's judgement' by supporting gay marriage. Conservatives, including top politicians and pundits like former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and Fox News commentator Mike Huckabee, have rallied to the defense of the company -- citing concerns over freedom of speech and freedom of religion. Scroll down for video . In your face: Gay rights groups are hoping to combat yesterday's Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day with a same-sex kissing protest at stores across the country . Supporters: This scene, people standing in long lines to patronize a Chick-fil-A in Fresno, California, was played out at the chain's restaurants across the nation . Waiting: The drive-through lane in Huntsville, Alabama, circles the parking lot twice hundreds of people waited for their turn at a chicken sandwhich . Huckabee's Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day was a wildly successful national movement -- with nearly 700,000 people pledging to attend on Facebook. Photos emerged from across the nation -- from Texas to Colorado to California and Chicago -- of patrons waiting for hours to support the company. 'It's gone beyond anything I could have imagined,' Huckabee, a former Republican presidential candidate, told Fox News. 'Every one of (the stores) that I know have reported record, historic sales yesterday... A lot of the stores ran out of chicken before the end of the day.' Chick-fil-A says it had nothing to do . with planning the rally that brought customers to its stores in droves, . but it appreciated the business. Should Chick-fil-A be free to voice their support for the biblical definition of marriage? 'We are very grateful and humbled by . the incredible turnout of loyal Chick-fil-A customers on August 1 at . Chick-fil-A restaurants around the country,' the company said in a . statement. It added: 'While we don't release exact sales numbers, we can confirm reports that it was a record-setting day.' Gay rights groups like the Gay and . Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation are firing back on Friday by . encouraging gay couples to 'show Chick-fil-A thanks for their support of . Love, Equality, and the Real Definition of Marriage!' by smooching at . the restaurant and photographing the evidence. Organizers don't recommend eating at Chick-fil-A and are encouraging their supporters to visit Kentucky Fried Chicken. Mockery: The Facebook group for the National Same Sex Kissing Day plays off the Chick-fil-A slogan 'eat mor chikin' with the motto 'kiss mor chicks' Show of faith: A pair of nuns were photographed walking out of a Chick-fil-A on Wednesday loaded with food, milkshakes and iced tea . Competition: A Wendy's franchise owner in North Carolina had several of his stores post support for Chick-fil-A on their marquee signs . A 20-year-old gay man and self-described liberal supporter of President Barack Obama, made a surprising announcement when he revealed he would continue eating at Chick-fil-A. The man, who gave his name only as Matt, wrote in a column for CNN iReport that 'Cathy has been unfairly attacked for his statement that he doesn't support same-sex marriage.' He argues that Cathy has a right to his opinion and  he respects Chick-fil-A for closing on Sundays out of principle. Matt writes that when gay rights activist 'push on anti-gay people and organizations to change their minds and opinions via bullying or forced involvement,' the results will not be favorable. 'I'm a gay man. I love Chick-fil-A as a place to get good tasting food. I . do not support their beliefs and disagree with their funding of groups . that are well known to be anti-gay activists. Personally they have never . treated me any different as a gay man and I will continue to do . business with them so long as that holds true,' he writes. Despite . their efforts, the protest is unlikely to come close to matching the . impact of Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day -- only 11,000 Facebook users . have said they plan to attend 'National Same Sex Kiss Day.' Not all gay people support the boycott, though. A 20-year-old gay man, who said he is a liberal who supports President Barack Obama, wrote a piece for CNN iReport in which he defended Cathy's right to oppose gay marriage. The man said he planned to continue eating at Chick-fil-A because he thinks the reaction of gay rights groups has been overblown -- and their southern-style chicken sandwiches taste good, too. As opponents regroup, Chick-fil-A is finding even more supporters -- including the owner of competing fast food restaurants. Jim Furman, the biggest Wendy's franchise owner in the world, posted 'We stand with Chick-fil-A' on the signs outside several of his restaurants in North and South Carolina, reported WBTV in Charlotte. The Wendy's corporate office issued a statement distancing the company from Mr Furman, saying 'we are proud to serve customers of varied races, backgrounds, cultures and sexual orientation, with different beliefs and values.' Mr Furman took the signs down after speaking with Wendy's officials. Roman Catholic Cardinal Francis George, the leader of the Archdiocese of Chicago, also sided with Chick-fil-A when he criticized Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel for blasting the company's anti-gay marriage stance. The mayor said the chain's values 'are . not Chicago's values' and said he did not welcome plans to . build additional restaurants in Chicago. Face off: When Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said that Chick-fil-A's values 'are not Chicago's values,' Cardinal Francis George said the mayor's view doesn't represent the Catholics who support 'traditional marriage' Controversy: CEO Dan Cathy drew ire from gay rights groups with his comments about same sex marriage . That opinion was shared and repeated by the mayors of San Francisco and Boston, as well. Emanuel's . words, along with a vow by Alderman Proco 'Joe' Moreno to block any . expansion in the city, drew Cardinal George's ire. 'I . was born and raised here, and my understanding of being a Chicagoan . never included submitting my value system to the government for . approval. Must those whose personal values do not conform to those of . the government of the day move from the city?' he wrote on the Chicago . Archdiocese blog on Sunday. A . church spokeswoman said the cardinal was standing up for 'religious . freedom' and that he has long spoken out against same-sex marriage. Cathy, the son of the company's founder, was quoted in a Baptist newspaper on July 16 saying he was 'guilty as charged' when asked about his opposition to gay marriage. He later told a Christian radio show: 'I think we are inviting God's judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at Him and say, ""We know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage,"" and I pray God's mercy on our generation that has such a prideful, arrogant attitude to think that we have the audacity to try to redefine what marriage is about.' Cathy says Chick-fil-A isn't a Christian . company -- however its stores are all closed on Sunday, even in . airports and shopping malls, and his company biography says the purpose of his business is to 'glorify God by being a faithful steward of all . that is entrusted to us.' Opposition: Gay rights supporter Trey King stood outside the Chick-fil-A in Hollywood, California, on Wednesday with a rainbow flag to protest the chain's opposition to gay marriage . Picketing: The massive crowds drew handfuls of gay rights protestors to Chick-fil-A on Wednesday . Chick-fil-A also puts its money where its mouth is, donating $5 million to Christian groups between 2003 and 2010. The company supported groups like the Family Research Council, which lobbies Congress on a host of conservative social issues -- including the prohibition of gay marriage. Chick-fil-A, a $4.5 billion company, has made the Cathy family very wealthy. Dan Cathy, who runs operations, owns one-third of the family business -- making him a billionaire.

This is the man who wrote-off a video showing a group of Syrian children being tortured as 'British propaganda', happily walking the streets of London. Expensively dressed and clutching his briefcase Dr Fawas Akhras is no usual pedestrian, he is the father-in-law of hated tyrant Bashar al-Assad and apologist for his brutal regime and its atrocities. Akhras, whose daughter Asma is married to the Syrian president, was probably on his way to work as a cardiologist on London's exclusive Harley Street. Apologist: The father-in-law of brutal Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, Dr Fawas Akhras, has been spotted walking down a London street . Looking down as he strolled the quiet Acton street, he then jumped into a luxury BMW. Neighbours said that he has not been seen in the area since May but he reappeared this week. Earlier this year a series of explosive emails showed that he was backing his tyrant son-in-law and what he was doing to his own people. He has also defended the regime publicly in an interview. In correspondence to al-Assad, signed off with 'warmest', he rubbished UN worries about the number of deaths in Syria. He also branded the West hypocrites for taking action to stop Wall Street protestors, and torture in Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib jails as well as setting out a 13-point critique explaining why criticisms of al-Assad's regime were wrong, calling it the 'direct the . argument toward the other side.' Off to work: Akhras gets into his BMW and was perhaps off to Harley Street where he works as a cardiologist . Couple:  Asma al-Assad, left, is Fawas Akhras' daughter, and is married to Syrian leader  Bashar al-Assad, right . Denials: The cardiologist has defended the actions of his son-in-law, revealed in e-mails and interviews he has given . Mass grave: A funeral of 35 victims of shelling in the town of Artouz, near Damascus, shows the scale of violence in the country . Astonishingly he also compared the Syrian uprising to the London riots and claimed the use of armed force against the people of Homs was justified because lives were at stake – and after all, David Cameron had threatened to use the army against rioters. ‘When the London riots burst out and Mr Cameron said he would get the army out, now would you compare that to Homs?' he said in an interview. ‘What would you do? Just watch them killing you? You have a responsibility to ensure the security of your people.’ It was then pointed out to him that the riots in London had been quelled without the authorities killing anyone, to which Dr Akhras, co-chairman of the British-Syrian Society, replied: ‘We are not as sophisticated as the Metropolitan Police or Scotland Yard.’ He went on to tell the Daily Telegraph that the . death toll in Syria of 7,000 was ‘much better’ than the Libyan one, . which some rebel reports put at 50,000. Head down: Fawas Akhrashas not been seen at his Acton home since May until he turned up this week, neighbours said . It came as Britain said it is set to increase its support for Syrian opposition forces in their fight against the nation's brutal dictator Bashar al-Assad, William Hague revealed today. But the cash boost will only come in the form of 'non-lethal' support - including the training of citizen journalists to 'get the word out' about the atrocities. It will not, however, involve sending armaments to the beleaguered rebels, the British Foreign Secretary added.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:24 EST, 3 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:46 EST, 3 August 2012 . Drew Peterson's ex-wife told her sister that she believed he would kill her, then begged her sister to take care of her two sons, just six weeks before her death, the sister testified on Friday. Anna Doman provided the trial's first testimony including what prosecutors have called 'from the grave' statements -- comments Peterson's ex-wife Kathleen Savio allegedly made to others about him threatening to kill her well before her body was found in her bathtub. Peterson is charged with first-degree murder in the 2004 drowning death of Savio, his third wife. He was charged in Savio's death after his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, went missing in 2007. Drew Peterson's ex-wife's sister told the court: 'Kathleen said that Drew told her he was going to kill her, she was not going to make it to the divorce settlement, she would not get his pension or his children' Grave charges: Peterson is accused of murdering . Kathleen Savio, left.  It was initially thought that she had drowned . accidentally in the bathtub, right, but after her body was exhumed her . death was ruled as a homicide . Hearsay evidence about what Savio allegedly said to other people is crucial to prosecutors, who have acknowledged they have no physical evidence linking Peterson to Savio's death. 'She said that Drew told her he was going to kill her, she was not going to make it to the divorce settlement, she would not get his pension or his children,' said Doman, referring to what prosecutors have said was a settlement involving two homes, a tavern Peterson and Savio owned and Peterson's pension from his career as a Bolingbrook police officer. 'She made me promise over and over that I would take care of her boys, over and over (she said), ""I want to hear you say it because everything's going to them"".' Hearsay, or statements not based on the direct knowledge of a witness, is not usually admissible in court. But Illinois judges can allow in murder trials under certain circumstances. Doman's testimony was the most dramatic so far in the trial that, since beginning on Monday, has been beset by a series of prosecutorial blunders that prompted the judge to seriously consider granting a request by Peterson's attorneys to declare a mistrial. Judge: Edward Burmila decided against declaring a mistrial in Peterson's murder case on Thursday, saying the former police officer still can get a fair trial despite several blunders by prosecutors . Sketch: Drew Peterson, left, looks on as defense attorney Joe Lopez cross examines Kathleen Savio's neighbor, Mary Pontarelli, as they view a photo of Savio's lifeless body in the tub of her home . But during intense cross examination, Doman acknowledged she didn't tell police about Savio's alleged comments until three years later, shortly after Peterson's fourth wife, Stacy, disappeared. Peterson has been named a suspect in that disappearance but has not been charged. 'You sat on that for three years,' defense attorney Joe Lopez said to Doman, who acknowledged never voicing any suspicions about Peterson to the county coroner or police after Savio died. She also said she invited Peterson and his sons to a banquet at a Polish hall shortly after Savio's death. Doman did not dispute Lopez's assertion that when she did come forward with details and documents about Savio, it was not to police, but to a producer from Greta Van Susteren's cable television show -- one of many media representatives who descended on Peterson's Bolingbrook home after Stacy Peterson disappeared. Doman said 'no one would listen' when she tried to call police, but she acknowledged she did not have any documentation of the calls she said she made. She also quietly admitted under cross-examination that after her sister's death she never tried to get custody of Savio's children or even contact them or send them birthday or Christmas cards. Doman's testimony was cut short on Friday after the judge recessed the court because of a sick juror. A male juror had been repeatedly coughing and testimony had been interrupted several times to let him recover. In memoriam: Flowers and a small angel statue surround the grave marker of Kathleen Savio, the third wife of Peterson, at the Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Hillside, Illinois . Before the recess prosecutors had planned to call a retired Illinois State Police sergeant who was in charge of the investigation of Savio's death and a crime scene technician who responded to Savio's house the night her body was found. Judge Edward Burmila said the trial would reconvene on Tuesday. A furious Burmila admonished prosecutors on Wednesday after the second witness in just their second day of testimony began talking about finding a .38-caliber bullet on his driveway. Thomas Pontarelli, a former neighbor of Savio's, hinted in his testimony that Peterson may have planted it there to intimidate him. Prosecutors later admitted under tough questioning by the judge that there was no evidence to support the claim. And Burmila wondered aloud about whether the testimony made Peterson appear menacing in jurors' eyes and undermined his ability to get a fair trial. But after heated arguments by both sides on Thursday morning, Burmila told attorneys that 'the court believes that the defendant's ability to receive a fair trial is not extinguished at this time'. Yesterday: Attorneys for Drew Peterson, from left, Joe Lopez, Steve Greenber, and Joel Brodsky listen as Pam Bosco, a friend and spokesperson for the family of Stacy Peterson address the media during a recess in court . Prosecutors: Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow told the court during opening statements that Peterson killed his wife and made it look like an accident . Prosecutors contend Peterson killed Savio and tried to make it look like an accident. Defense . attorney Joel Brodsky told jurors repeatedly during his opening . statement that there was no evidence Savio's death was anything but a . tragic accident. His . defense attorney's argued on Tuesday that Peterson was a victim of a . 24-hour news cycle and cable TV's talking heads, which together created a . media frenzy that did not subside until prosecutors had charged an . innocent man. Will County State's Attorney James Glasgow told jurors that Peterson, 58, killed Savio, 40, and made it look like an accident. 'Just weeks before her death, he told her he was going to kill her and she would not make it to a divorce settlement and would never get his pension,' Glasgow said during opening statements. Peterson's real-life drama inspired a TV movie and a national spotlight was put on the case, as many speculated whether Peterson used his law-enforcement expertise to get away with Savio's murder and make 23-year-old Stacy Peterson vanish. Distress: Marcia and Henry Savio, parents of Drew Peterson's third wife Kathleen, return to court as he stands trial for her murder . Missing: Peterson, right, is also the chief suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, right . The . outcome of the trial may also hang on which forensic pathologist the . seven men and five women on the jury will believe: Bryan Mitchell or . Larry Blum. Mitchell, . who investigated Savio’s death in 2004 and ruled that a gash on her head . and bruises on her body were consistent with an accidental fall, died . earlier this year. The defense will likely call expert witnesses to . testify that the woman’s death was accidental. Blum, who investigated Savio's body . after it was exhumed in 2007, will testify for the prosecution at the . trial about what made him switch the cause of death from an accidental . fall to homicidal drowning. ‘First, they are not going to be able . to say that (the death investigation was botched) because it wasn't,’ Peterson's attorney said. ‘By saying that if they had done a better job . in the investigation, then they would have been able to prosecute Drew . Peterson, that lowers the burden of proof. Where you don't have . evidence, you presume innocence.’","Former cop was charged in 2004 death .

Mr Benjamin was driven to the hostel in Burton Road and ordered to hand over his mobile phone and the keys to a flat in Acklington Drive on the Grahame Park Estate in Colindale, north London. His body was discovered the hostel at lunchtime on November 15. ‘Ferell Benjamin was lying face down on the floor in the toilet area of the hostel on the first floor of that building,’ said Mr Denison. ‘His body had in fact been seen there by one of the other residents in the early hours of the morning, but she hadn’t looked closely at him and thought he was sleeping. ‘If she had been looking closely she would have seen he had been stripped naked, apart from his boxer shorts, and his back had been severely scalded by burning liquid - probably boiling water. ‘Blood spattered on the walls around where he lay and pools of blood on the floor beneath him showed he had been beaten and killed in that area.

Performance: Antonio Calenda, with Natasha Diamond-Walker to his right, is seeking the value of the apartment plus $1million in damages from his former girlfriend . The suit was filed on Monday in Manhattan Supreme Court for the cost of the one-bedroom condo plus an extra $1 million in damages. Mr Calenda's lawyer, Marc Fitapelli told the MailOnline: 'She never had any intentions to repay our client and she abruptly severed their relationship as soon as she got what she wanted.' He went on to claim that the stunning 27-year-old 'manipulated' his client and 'took advantage of him.' The couple met while working on a project in Italy together last year. Cercando Picasso (Looking for Picasso), a show that features dancers interpreting Pablo Picasso's paintings, dreams and writings. Talented: Miss Diamond-Walker met her director boyfriend while both working on an artistic project in Italy together . Bending over backwards: Mr Calenda had a written agreement with the dancer that he would loan her the money for an apartment... but she allegedly said the money was a gift . They began a 10-month romance where . the young woman was showered with expensive gifts by the experienced . director, who separated from his wife ten years ago. Friends that witnessed the whirlwind romance said that there was nothing out of the ordinary about it. 'They had a personal relationship ...

Dead: Anthony Hills, 55, pictured, died on Saturday after being infected with flesh-eating bacteria . A South Carolina man has died just hours after being rushed to hospital with a flesh-eating disease. Anthony Hills, 55, from Charleston, passed away on Saturday having contracted necrotizing fasciitis - the same disease that savagely struck Georgia student Aimee Copeland and saw all four of her limbs amputated. Hills' family rushed the man to Medical University of South Carolina with a swollen arm after he complained of not feeling well. Doctors said the infection started in Hills' right arm and right leg and his condition deteriorated rapidly. 'It's a lightning strike kind of thing you know, where it just doesn't happen that often,' Dr Michael Kilby, chief of infectious disease at the hospital, told Live Five News. 'But when it does, it goes sour really fast and needs medical attention really quickly.' They amputated the affected arm and were considering removing his left leg before he died, according to the TV station. It is not known how the man contracted the disease. Hills is the third American to die from the rare strain of flesh-eating bacteria this year. Linda Snyder, a pastor from Sacramento, California, lost her life in June after being infected with necrotizing fasciitis. Flesh-eating: Necrotizing fasciitis infects a simple cut or pimple and spreads rapidly potentially leading to the death of the patient (stock photo) Michigan woman Crystal Spencer, 33, also died in June after a month-long battle with the vicious disease. Scores of other victims have had often multiple limbs removed in a bid to contain the infection. In South Carolina alone, hospital officials at Roper St. Francis confirmed an adult male was admitted to the hospital in mid-June with the bacteria but his status is unknown. In May, new mother, Lana Kuykendall, . contracted necrotizing fasciitis in a hospital in upstate South . Carolina, just after delivering her twin babies. Recovering: Aimee Copeland, right, with medic Kori Mills left a Georgia hospital in July after the disease took four of her limbs . Death by bacteria: Crystal Spencer has died after contracting a flesh-eating bacteria a month ago . She underwent 20 surgical procedures to stop the aggressive bacteria spreading but managed to avoid having any limbs amputated. Earlier this year, doctors at MUSC helped save the life of 59-year-old Hilton Head man, Barry Ginn, who contracted the rare strain of bacteria in his collarbone and left shoulder. But the Charleston County . Coroner's Office said this was the first known case of flesh-eating bacteria . to result in death in Charleston County. According to the CDC, up to 800 cases of the infection are reported a year, and around 20 per cent of those are fatal. Deteriorated rapidly: Hills died just hours after family rushed him to the Medical University of South Carolina, pictured . 'The causes of the infection are not that unusual,' Dr Kilby told ABC News. 'You don't have to be in the jungle or exposed to animals or have any unusual exposure.  It's just normal bacteria that are all around that just get into the wrong place. 'One theory is that the same old bacteria develop a new toxin or new characteristic that makes it more invasive,' he said. At least three Americans have died and another eight victims have had limbs amputated after contracting the rare and extremely vicious disease known as necrotizing fasciitis. The nasty bacteria, more commonly called 'flesh-eating disease', rapidly causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat. The bug enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape and as the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area. Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body. Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock are also common complications. Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg. Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons.

Prisoners are being paid £15 a day to work in a call centre selling ‘green’ solar panels and home insulation to the public. The inmates reportedly include a killer and a fraudster, and customers will have no idea they are talking to a serving prisoner. The Ministry of Justice has struck a controversial deal to give the inmates work experience at the South Wales environmental roofing company Becoming Green. Solar energy company Becoming Green employs 25 inmates from the prison in south Wales to work in its call centre . They are taken by bus 21 miles from . Prescoed prison near Usk in Monmouthshire to work in the company’s . telephone sales division in Cardiff. Prisoners do not cold call members of . the public, according to the Ministry of Justice.

Union leaders claim that, since the . deal was struck, regular workers on full wages at the company have been . fired. Andy Richards, Unite Wales regional secretary, said: ‘This looks . likes a disgraceful and worrying development. ‘It is nothing short of Dickensian to exploit prisoners [in this way] while Cardiff call centre workers lose their jobs. ‘This company seems to be all too . readily taking advantage of cheap labour. Not only is it fundamentally . immoral but it’s bad for the Welsh workforce and damaging to the Welsh . economy.’ In total, Becoming Green has taken on . 23 day-release prisoners.

The 11 prisoners receiving . the minimum wage are allowed to keep 60 per cent of what they earn, but . the other 40 per cent goes into a victims’ fund, according to the Prison . Service. Prescoed is an open prison and inmates . on day release schemes will have been assessed by officials as no . longer posing a risk to the public or being likely to abscond, even . though their convictions are for serious offences. Steve Gillan, general secretary of the . Prison Officers Association, said that for any company to rely on cheap . labour of prisoners was ‘immoral and disgusting’. But the Ministry of Justice said it . was vital to give prisoners the skills they need to get back into work . if re-offending is to be reduced. A Prison Service spokesman said: ‘Our . rules are very clear: prisoners employed by outside companies cannot . replace existing staff. They can only fill genuinely vacant posts. ‘Becoming Green have made it clear . that the prisoners they employ are filling genuinely vacant posts and . that no serving members of staff have been made redundant to make way . for prisoners. ‘The company has expanded over the . past year, employing more members of the public, not less, and is still . advertising.

A couple has been pulled before a judge after they refused to let their eight-year-old daughter undergo chemotherapy for a brain tumour, opting for alternative treatment instead. Sarah Parisian, from Minnetonka, Minnesota, had 90 per cent of the cancerous tumour removed last December and underwent a cycle of chemotherapy - but endured painful suffering, her parents said. When they told doctors they would not allow her to go through it again, Jon and Karen Parisian were reported to Child Protection Services and ordered into court. Scroll down for video . Court battle: The parents of Sarah Parisian, 8, refused to allow their daughter to undergo chemotherapy for a brain tumour and wanted to opt for other treatments instead . There, the family was told if they did not work on a treatment plan with doctors, Sarah would be taken from them. This week, the family and physicians reached a compromise so she will undergo less treatment that doctors hope will still be effective - but the family is bitter about the pressure. 'Parents should have freedom,' Sarah's mother Karen told the Brainerd Dispatch. Sarah underwent the operation to . remove the tumour last December. The family sought a treatment that . would yield fewer side effects, and chose proton therapy, which could . only be done in Chicago. After the treatment they stayed in Illinois . for seven weeks, where Sarah suffered from exhaustion, nausea, a sore throat, hair and weight loss, her mother told WCCO. 'The week that we started chemo she was sleeping 22 hours a day,' said Karen, who has another daughter, 11-year-old Savannah, with her husband. Orders: Doctors contacted Child Protective Services and the Parisians, pictured with Sarah and their oldest daughter, were ordered to make a compromise in court - otherwise Sarah would be taken from them . Pain: They argued that after one cycle of chemo she suffered weight loss, illness and slept for 22 hours a day . Struggle: Doctors said that every day her parents withheld treatment, Sarah's survival was compromised . 'She is very sick from the standard . treatment so we wanted to explore an option of modifying the treatment . so that it would be more appropriate for Sarah.' But doctors argued the child's chances of survival worsened each day she was not treated. 'So in order to modify her treatment we had to go in front of a judge and fortunately we seem to be working this out,' Karen, a financial adviser, added. Dr. Kevin Conners, an integrative cancer specialist, told WCCO a compromise could be reached to 'do what's best for the patient'. 'Let's take her case as an individual case and... look at her as an individual what she can tolerate what other therapies added to a traditional approach is going to be best for her,' he said. The youngster will now stay at home but undergo some treatment that will not 'send her tipping over the edge,' Dr. Connors said. The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office . said that it respects the right of parents to make decisions for their . children, but that the Parisians were not doing what was best for their . child. Moving forward: The court ordered Sarah (second left) to undergo less treatment and her parents agreed . Anger: But Karen Parisian, pictured talking to local reporters with her family, said she was frustrated she was not allowed to decide what was best for her daughter . While the family are happy to have . reached a compromise that will benefit Sarah, Karen said she was annoyed . that she had not been able to make a decision she believed was best for . her daughter. 'As parents, you don’t have the right to choose the kind of treatment you want your child to have,' she said. Sarah begins testing and treatment on Friday. After Sarah was diagnosed with the brain tumour, her mother and older sister cut their hair in solidarity and donated it to Locks for Love, which makes hair pieces for cancer patients.

Busted: Federal agents have so far unearthed 4,100 images of child pornography and child erotica on just one of the more than 500 CDs seized from David Moe's home . David Moe, 45, worked as a teacher at the exclusive Paddington Station School in Denver for the past 18 years. He was arrested on July 24 for possessing large amounts of child pornography, but has since posted bail. Moe will be allowed to leave jail on the conditions that he put his $283,300 home up for bail and remain in the custody of his parents. The former teacher was also ordered to avoid all contact with children and is prohibited from accessing the Internet and subscribing to any Internet services, according to the Denver Post. The judge demanded thirteen condition in total be met, including one that Moe live with his parents and wear an ankle monitor at all times. He is ordered to remain indoors except when he must attend court. During the bail hearing this week, Denver prosecutors read out excerpts from the secret 800-page diary of Moe, which he had kept since 1997. Of one girl, Moe wrote, 'Did hold [name withheld by prosecutors] by the waist briefly, and she didn't flinch.' Another record read: 'Had [name withheld] by the hips, and she was fine by that,' Moe wrote of another little girl entrusted to his care. 'Gave . her a kiss on the cheek, and no bad reaction. I love her so much.' In reply to one of his advances, Moe recalled a girl saying: 'I . only let my family tickle me.' To this, he said in his diary: 'She's obviously been coached.' Prosecutors revealed the journal's . existence in a Denver federal court to argue to . Magistrate Judge Michael Hegarty that Moe should not be released before his . upcoming trial. But despite all of the chilling testimony revealed by federal agents handling the case, Judge Hegarty seemed skeptical the journal was, as Denver's 9News.com put it in their account of the proceedings, a smoking gun. Innocence lost: Moe toiled at Paddington Station School, pictured, which is thought of as a haven for the privileged children of Denver's elite . Instead, Hegarty suggested the journal . may simply represent a child care worker's log of innocuous day-to-day . activities with his students, chronicled to provide a defence against . allegations of inappropriate conduct. A defence attorney, for his part, maintained the journal, and the behavior contained therein, represented, as the Denver T.V. station put it, 'only a record of benign, caring interactions between a preschool teacher and his students.' Paul McCormick did not try to gild his client's affinity for kiddie porn, but rather argued that Moe had constructed a de facto 'wall' between his sordid peccadilloes for porn, and how he interacted with the children entrusted to his care. 'When someone has 'fessed up and come clean,' McCormick told the judge. 'They're well down the road to recovery.' Despite this, prosecutors reportedly disclosed information about an alleged incident 10 years ago when a Paddington family accused Moe of improperly touching their 3-year-old daughter. A federal agent testified Tuesday that the 2001 allegation concerned a young girl adopted from a Romanian orphanage who was still learning English. Shades of Sandusky: Like the former Penn State football coach, Jerry Sandusky, pictured, prosecutors allege Dave Moe 'groomed' potential victims, testing boundaries and limits . The agent testified, according to 9News.com, the girl's parents said their daughter kept repeating the phrase 'Dave touch' as she pointed to her genitals. The agent also swore under oath that the girls' parents believe Moe once changed their daughter's diaper in a remote, unused section of the school. However, Moe just faces charges of owning child pornography. He first reportedly told federal agents he owned about 200 images. But prosecutors revealed in court Tuesday federal agents unearthed 4,100 images of child porno and child erotica on just one of the more than 500 CDs seized from Moe's home. Along with that stockpiled stash of CDs, federal agents working for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security confiscated six portable hard drives and two desktop computers containing as-yet undisclosed materials from Moe's abode. Tuesday's court proceedings were witnessed by many Paddington Station School parents, many of which, according to 9News.com, shielded their ears with hands and fingers so as to muffle disturbing accounts of what agents found in Moe's cache. Still, Hegarty reserved judgement, reportedly saying Tuesday, 'This is not the Roman Coliseum where it's a thumbs up, thumbs down decision by the community.' The judge later added, 'There's no evidence of grooming. There is an obsession with his interactions with small children...That is strange. It is odd. It is disconcerting. It is alarming. I don't want a horrific event occurring on my watch.' Moe resigned from the school last Thursday. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","David Moe meticulously recorded the limits he could go with each child, writing of one little girl, 'Gave her a kiss on the cheek, and no bad reaction.'

Team USA may have been celebrating dominance in the pool and on the tennis court on Saturday, but in track and field events the mood was far less joyful. American athletes picked up just three medals, and not a single gold, on the second day of running, jumping and throwing events. And to add injury to insult, one of the team's greatest medal hopes pulled out of the 400m due to a hamstring strain. Disappointment: Carmelita Jeter, right, came second in the women's 100m on Saturday evening in London . Agony: Galen Rupp, left, finished the men's 10,000m just behind his training partner Mo Farah . Third place: Team USA's other medal came from Will Claye, who picked up bronze in the long jump . While three medals from six events would be a decent haul for most other nations, it is a blow for the U.S., which has traditionally dominated track and field. To make matters worse, the poor results came on a day dominated by Great Britain, usually seen as the junior partner in the so-called 'Special Relationship'. The team's first medal of the day came in the men's long jump, when Will Claye took the bronze with a score of 8.12m. Claye, an Arizona 21-year-old competing in his first Games, was nearly 20cm behind the gold medallist, Britain's Greg Rutherford, who put his home advantage to good use as he jumped 8.31m. Over: 21-year-old Claye reacts after his 8.12m jump in the final of the field event on Saturday . Bronze: Claye poses with the winner and runner-up, Britain's Greg Rutherford and Australian Mitchell Watt . The next American medallist was long-distance runner Galen Rupp, who took silver in the men's 10,000m after completing the course in 27:30.90. If the 26-year-old from Oregon had matched his own personal best of 26:48.00, it would have been enough to beat his training partner, Mo Farah of the UK, who came in just half a second faster than Rupp. Veteran sprinter Carmelita Jeter was tipped by some for a gold medal in the women's 100m, but could not do enough to dethrone reigning champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, of Jamaica. Californian Jeter, 32, ran 10.78 seconds, only a fraction behind her rival's 10.75. Celebration: Close friends Farah and Rupp congratulate each other at the conclusion of their race . Partners: Rupp showed the rigours of the longest track race as he celebrated with Farah . The experienced runner had never appeared in the Olympics before, despite being a three-time World Championships gold medallist. Although she holds the title of second-fastest female 100m runner in history, with a personal best of 10.64, she was unable to break the Jamaican dominance of the ultimate sprint event. There are still plenty of track and field medals up for grabs, and Team USA will be hoping to improve on its patchy record in the days to come. Patriotic: Jeter poses with the Stars and Stripes after securing her 100m silver medal . Greeting: The sprinter waves to the crowd after the event on Friday evening in London . Not good enough: This image shows how Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce landed the gold medal ahead of Jeter . However, one star who will not be able to compete for glory is LaShawn Merritt, who won the 400m gold medal in Beijing four years ago. Merritt was forced to pull out of the first heat on Saturday after pulling up with a hamstring problem. He had intended to turn the page on a disheartening four years that included an embarrassing, 21-month drug suspension. 'It's very disappointing to ... be dealing with an issue and not be able to finish the race,' Merritt said. 'I'll regroup.' Injured: Lashawn Merritt, pictured, walks off the track after failing to finish his men's 400m round 1 heat . Ice: The sprinter, pictured, places ice onto his injured hamstring following his failed heat . The runner's hamstring issues stem from an injury he suffered last month during a tuneup race in Monaco. But Merritt is refusing to dwell on his London misfortune, instead concentrating on the next steps for his career. 'It's not the end of the world,' he said. 'The Olympics is going to come around again. Next year is a world championship.' 'We have a season every year. So now it's a matter of getting healthy and getting back to what I love to do.'","Carmelita Jeter wins silver in women's 100m and Galen Rupp loses to training partner in men's 10,000m .

'Suicide': Anna Oung, 29, was found in the trunk of her car and police believe she killed herself . A woman whose body was found in the trunk of her car by her husband killed herself after suffering from 'postpartum psychosis' three months since the birth of her first child, police believe. The body of 29-year-old Anna Oung was found on Tuesday evening in her car parked in Irvine, California when her concerned husband tracked her mobile phone service using GPS. 'All the evidence investigators have discovered to date', including preliminary results from a coroner's medical examination, is 'consistent with the death being a suicide', Irvine police Lt. Julia Engen said. Since the birth of the couple's first child three months ago, Oung had been diagnosed with postpartum psychosis and was receiving treatments, friends and family told police, the Orange County Register reported. It is a rare mental illness that comes on quickly after the birth of a child, and includes symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, feeling irritated, hyperactivity and a decreased need for sleep, paranoia and changing mood swings. The announcement comes despite the Orange County Coroner's Office not yet determining an official cause of death. A 'final ruling' on the cause will be made in the coming weeks, Engen said. Oung's husband, who has not been named, had become concerned after his wife was several hours late returning home from work and called the Long Beach Police Department to report her missing. Final resting place: The car was found parked near the University of California-Irvine, though the husband had no reason why it would be there . Home: Though the couple lives in this Los Angeles home, there is no clear reason why Oung would have been near the college campus . Postpartum Psychosis is the most most extreme postpartum mood disorder that has a quick onset quickly after a woman gives birth. Symptoms include delusions, hallucinations, feeling irritated, hyperactivity and a decreased need for sleep, paranoia and changing mood swings. Women are most at risk if they have a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, or if they have had a previous psychotic episode. It is rare compared to the rates of . postpartum depression or anxiety, occurring approximately one to two out . of every 1,000 deliveries. It usually occurs within the first four weeks . after giving birth and is more common in first-time mothers. Postpartum psychosis has a five per cent suicide rate and a four per cent infanticide rate. Five hours later, with the help of his cell phone company, he found her silver Honda sedan in a residential area near the campus of University of California-Irvine a few miles from where she works. Her husband has no idea how or why it got there but it appeared to be unoccupied. Because he did not have the keys to the car, he called police who then opened the trunk and found Ms Oung's dead body. Very few specifics about the case have been released publicly. Police have announced that there was visible bruising on Ms Oung's body, but they would not say how or what caused the injuries. The 'unusual nature of the discovery' at first led police to term the incident 'suspicious', but authorities said foul play is no longer suspected. 'It's really sad... shocking,' one of Ms Oung's neighbors told local KTLA. 'He was always bike riding and just always with her. 'Every time she came, he was outside helping her park... They were always happy,' the neighbor said of the couple. WATCH THE VIDEO HERE .","Anna Oung, 29, was found dead in her car on Tuesday evening .

Work experience: Ministers believe the plan will get offenders out of their cells and used to the world of work . Ministers are considering setting up call centres inside jails. Justice Secretary Ken Clarke's department is looking at inviting companies to set up offices in prisons, where inmates would man the phones. It means people ringing their bank or a large store could end up having their calls answered by an offender. The aim is to try to get prisoners used to the world of work. A promotional leaflet claimed the scheme amounted to a 'fantastic rehabilitation revolution', and boasted that prison-run call centres could offer trained operators 'with British regional accents as an effective alternative to off-shoring operations'. The Ministry of Justice said setting up call centres inside prisons was one of many options for providing inmates with more work. Details of the plans emerged after the Daily Mail reported on Thursday that inmates from Prescoed prison near Usk in Monmouthshire are being paid £15 a day to work in a call centre selling solar panels and home insulation to the public. The ministry has struck a controversial deal to give the day-release prisoners work experience at the South Wales environmental roofing company Becoming Green. Plans for call centres inside jails are outlined in marketing material from a company called UrbanData. Boasts: A leaflet detailing the plans boasted that prison-run call centres could offer trained operators 'with British regional accents as an effective alternative to off shoring operations', such as this call centre in India . The flyer, sent out to businesses that might want to open a call centre, said the scheme had government support. 'Working in partnership with the Ministry of Justice, we are establishing call centres inside prisons,' it said. Plans: Justice Secretary Ken Clarke's department is a looking at inviting companies to set up offices in prisons, where inmates would man the phones . 'We are training prisoners to become qualified contact centre operators.' The firm said it could offer 'lower costs and overheads' than other call centre firms. UrbanData went into liquidation last month, but the ministry is understood still to be interested in the idea. David Cameron has urged businesses to take advantage of the range of opportunities working prisoners offer. The Ministry of Justice said: 'Prisoners who learn the habit of real work inside prison are less likely to commit further crime when they are released. All contracts with outside employers must comply with a strict code of practice which sets out that prisoners cannot be used to replace existing jobs in the community.'","It means people ringing their bank or a large store could end up having their calls answered by offenders .

At least two people tried to break into a California juvenile detention facility in what investigators believe was unsuccessful attempt to free a teenager accused of stealing celebrity chef Guy Fieri’s Lamborghini. The attempted jailbreak happened at Marin County Juvenile early Friday morning when staff heard banging on the walls and saw ‘at least two people out there with a sledgehammer,’ said Sheriff's Lt. Barry Heying. The suspects fled on foot and then likely took off in a car before more than 40 deputies and other officers arrived at the scene and searched the buildings and neighborhood. Daring: The Lamborghini Max Wade, 17, (left) allegedly stole belongs to celebrity chef Guy Fieri, (right) who is one of Food Network's top stars . Investigators believe the suspects . were trying to free Max Wade, who is charged with stealing Fieri's . $200,000 yellow Lamborghini from a San Francisco car dealership in March . of 2011. The San Rafael, California, teen also faces attempted murder charges for trying to gun down a couple in Mill Valley in April. Wade has pleaded not guilty to charges . of attempted murder, vehicle theft, burglary and other crimes. Charged . as an adult, he could face up to 30 years in prison if convicted of all . counts. Wade turned 18 Friday and was . scheduled to be transferred to the county's adult jail. Marin County . Juvenile Hall only houses people under age 18. Supercar: Fieri's Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder, like the one pictures here, cost $200,000. It was hidden for more than a year after being stolen . Marin sheriff's Lt. Heying said that . at about 4:35 a.m., probation employees at Juvenile Hall heard a loud . banging sound on a wall on the south side of the facility's . Probation staff immediately evacuated . all the young detainees while police scoured the surrounding area. The . search was called off at 7:15am. Investigators found holes cut into two . perimeter fences, a sledge hammer, bolt cutters and a damaged window at . Wade's cell, according to the Marin Independent Journal. They also . discovered a backpack that contained a change of clothes. At the time of the incident, Wade was . the only high-security detainee of the 13 teens at the juvenile center, . and the only person held in the part of the building that was targeted . by the suspects, according to ABC. Failed breach: Police believe someone tried to free Max Wade from Marin County Juvenile before his transfer to jail . Heavy duty: The suspects used a bolt-cutter and a sledgehammer, trying the breach the walls of the building where Wade had been staying . Authorities did not have evidence that . Wade helped plan the operation, but the investigation is ongoing. Prosecutors said he could face additional charges if he is linked to the . breach. Wade has since been transferred to the Marin County Jail under heavy security. He is being held in lieu of $2million bail. Michael Daly, the county's chief . probation officer, said he plans to review security at Juvenile Hall, . but said it's impossible to hammer through the building's reinforced . concrete walls and extra thick windows. Daly added that his staff heard the perpetrators hit the wall at least 15-20 times, but failed to breach it. ‘Everyone should know it's not very easy to break into a detention facility,’ he said. Police are now reviewing recorded . conversations that Wade had had since . he was brought to the center on April 28. Escape plot: Besides the discarded tools, police said the suspects dropped a backpack with a change of clothes as they fled the scene . Police tracked down Wade . after he attacked a 17-year-old girl and her 18-year-old boyfriend in a . brazen drive-by shooting from atop a motorcycle. Two weeks after the . assault, he asked the girl out on a date -- and a chance to ride in . 'his' Lamborghini, according to police. Officers . arrested the Wade when the girl tipped off police. They were waiting . for him when he went to his storage locker in Richmond, California, to . pick up the car. Police discovered evidence there that also implicates . him in four bank robberies across northern California. In February, police say Wade broke . into a vacant hilltop mansion that overlooked the San Francisco Bay. He . invited 50 friends from his high school and told them the scenic escape . was his, the San Jose Mercury News reported. When cops showed up, he fled. Aftermath: Since the incident, Wade has been transferred to Marin County Jail under heavy security . Officers . believe Wade stole the rare Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder from a San . Francisco car dealership by rappelling from roof with . ropes and cutting off the locks on the doors. He left behind . mountaineering equipment after fleeing with the supercar. Happy Guy: Fieri had thanked law enforcement officials for 'cracking the case' and catching the person suspected of stealing his luxury car . Fieri . co-owns five restaurants in California and is the host of several . cooking shows, including Food Network's 'Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.' He is a noted collector of classic American muscle cars. Wade, who is charged as an adult, hid the car in a storage locker for more than a year. Police spotted it leaving San Fransisco via the Golden Gate Bridge, but could never track it past that. When officers arrested him, he tried to run and reached into his waistband, where he had stashed a loaded Glock semiautomatic pistol, $1,500 cash and fake IDs from three states, the San Fransisco Chronicle reported. Along with Fieri's Lamborghini, police found a troubling trove of gear, including an assault shotgun and an AK-47 assault rifle. He also had cell phone jammers, police radio scramblers and the scanner frequencies for several California police departments. Police found a full San Fransisco Police Department uniform, including a duty belt and badge. A mask that officers discovered could link him to four bank robberies that were carried out this spring and winter in northern California.","Max Wade was charged with stealing Guy Fieri's car and trying to gun down a couple .

Mitt Romney has made yet another gaffe by confusing ‘Sikh’ and ‘Sheikh’ whilst talking about the massacre at a Wisconsin Sikh temple. The Republican Presidential candidate twice confused the two terms and referred to the victims as the ‘Shiekh people’ who had been worshipping in a ‘Sheikh temple’. Sheikh is a Muslim term for the leader of a tribe or village. Confused: Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, seen in Iowa on Wednesday, twice confused the 'Sikh' and 'Sheikh' whilst talking about the recent shooting at a Wisconsin Sikh temple . Sikhs are not Muslims, although they have complained repeatedly about being confused for them since the 9/11 attacks, which were carried out by Islamists. The blunder is the latest in a string of gaffes after Romney caused deep offence in Britain and Palestine on a recent foreign tour. It came during a tribute to the six people who were killed and the three who were critically injured during the rampage at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in Oak Creek. Gunman Michael Page was shot dead at the scene. Reflection: Mourners are seen during a candlelight vigil outside of the Oak Creek Community Center on Tuesday after six were killed by a gunman at the Shiekh temple . Different faiths: Two victims of the shooting are pictured at a memorial for the Indian Sikhs, who are not Muslims but widely confused as being so since 9/11 . At a fundraising event in Iowa Romney said: ‘We had a moment of silence in honour of the people who lost their lives at that sheikh temple. I noted that it was a tragedy for many, many reasons. 1.  'It's hard to know just how well it will turn out ... There are a few things that were disconcerting' - on London hosting the Summer Olympics last July . 2.  ‘I’m also unemployed' - speaking to job hunters in Florida  in June, 2011 . 3.  'I like being able to fire people who provide services to me' - speaking last January in New Hampshire . 4.  'I’m not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there' - in an interview in Florida last February . 5. 'We're going to hang [Obama] with that. So to speak. Metaphorically. You have to be careful these days' - in April 2011 in New Hampshire . ‘Among them are the fact that people, the sheikh people, are among the most peaceable and loving individuals you can imagine, as is their faith.’ Romney's spokesman Rick Gorka said the error was simply because the candidate ‘mis-spoke’. He said: ‘He mispronounced similar sounding words. He was clearly referring to the tragedy in Wisconsin’. On his recent foreign tour, his first foreign trip as a presidential candidate, Romney was branded ‘Mitt the Twit’ and ‘Party Pooper’ by the British for suggesting the London Games would be a failure. Romney, who has been credited with rescuing the 2002 Salt Lake City Games, was also attacked by British Prime Minister David Cameron who said it was unfair to compare having The Games in London with hosting the event in a city which is ‘in the middle of nowhere’. Romney also had to play down comments . by one of his advisors that he understood the relationship between the . US and the UK better than President Obama because he appreciated its . shared ‘Anglo Saxon heritage’. During . a subsequent stop in Israel Romney was condemned as ‘racist’ by . Palestinians for suggesting that Israel was succeeding in comparison to . its Arab neighbours . He . said: ‘And as I come here and I look out over this city and consider the . accomplishments of the people of this nation, I recognise the power of . at least culture and a few other things’. Romney caused further outrage by saying . that Jerusalem was the capital of Israel - Palestinians consider the . East half of the city to be theirs but it has been occupied by Israel . since 1967. Campaigning: Romney's latest gaffe came during a fundraising event in Iowa, where he also looked at corn with Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Bill Northey (center) and farmer Lemar Koethe (left) Misspoke: A Romney spokesperson said the error was simply because the candidate misspoke and was clearly referring to the tragedy in Wisconsin . If Romney continues making such blunders he is in danger of overtaking Joe Biden as the most gaffe-prone politician in American politics. The vice president caused blushing all round in March when made a crass gag about lubrication whilst at a White House reception for Irish prime minister Enda Kenny. At his first campaign rally with President Obama after being selected as his running mate for the 2008 US election, Biden told a crowd: ‘A man I'm proud to call my friend. A man who will be the next President of the United States - Barack America!’ During another town hall meeting in Nashua, New Hampshire, Biden also said that Hillary Clinton, who ran for the Democratic nomination in 2008 but lost out to Mr Obama, ‘might have been a better pick than me’ as vice president.",Referred to Wisconsin Sikh temple victims using a Muslim term .

It was attended by 400 people, each paying upwards of $2,500 for a family of four. The event was the latest in a string of star-studded Obama fundraisers, including one attended by the President in Connecticut at the home of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein last week, and another in New York hosted by Anna Wintour and Sarah Jessica Parker last month.

'I . mean, they are letting all of us just enter their house, all the chaos, . and they're being so good about it today. So thank you, guys, for . letting us come - indeed.' The fundraiser had a casual theme that . was meant to attract families, enticing politically-active parents to . bring their children along with them for some games and food and . hopefully a word with Mrs Obama. In keeping with the theme of the . event, that chaos included a tennis court arranged with red, white and . blue balloons in the shape of the American flag.

Like many other Americans, AT&T is gearing up for the highly-anticipated iPhone 5 launch next month, moving to counter the flood of demand for the device. The iPhone 5 is set to be . unveiled during an Apple press conference in San Francisco on September 12 and go on sale just weeks . later. Apple's last iPhone model, the 4S - which introduced voice recognition system Siri, a new camera and a faster operating system - was introduced in October 2011. The next generation: Consumers have been waiting with baited breath for the launch of Apple's latest iPhone, the predecessor to the 4S model, pictured above . Sources at AT&T told BGR.com that the carrier is planning ahead for the release, putting an ‘all hands on deck' order in place from mid-September to mid-October. A separate source told the website that a regional training session slated for the first week of October has now been pushed back. The new iPhone is expected to have a larger 4 inch screen and a more powerful battery than current models. Some . tech insiders believe the iPhone 5 will have a rounder, curvier look . than the 4S. Others say it's unlikely that Apple will go back to the . rounded 'look' it abandoned before. A design concept, left shows a rounder, curvier new look for iPhone 5 and a . larger screen. Other tech insiders say it's unlikely that Apple will go . back to the rounded 'look' it abandoned before . It is also believed to be so the new handset can include LTE, a high speed '4G data network giving far faster speeds than current iPhones. Other rumours surrounding the iPhone point to a larger 4-inch display at a resolution of 1,136 x 640, along with a new two-tone back panel. While the iPhone 5 launch is highly anticipated, Apple has also come under fire over reports of a smaller dock connector that would force owners to buy an adapter for use with their current dock. Juiced up: Pictures claiming to be of the newer, more powerful iPhone 5 battery have been leaked to technology blog 9to5mac . It was revealed last week that Apple was trying to boost its declining sales by matching the $50 discount currently offered by Sprint on all models of the iPhone, dropping the price of the iPhone 4S drops to $150  from $200 when you sign a two-year contract. A 32GB goes down to $250, 64GB too $350 and the iPhone 4 goes right down to $50. But you won't find the offer . advertised anywhere. This is one of those rare occasions when it's not . who you know, but what you know that counts. The discount will only be applied if you mention the Sprint sale, at which point $50 drops off the total bill. And it doesn't apply online either, only in store. Rumours about the technology giant are not exactly rare, but this one, first reported by MacRumours, is for real. In fact it's likely it was started by Apple itself, in a bid to boost sales after rumours of the soon-to-be-released iPhone 5 saw sales slump. Would-be-buyers are thought to have put their credit on hold to await the arrival of the next-generation phone, thought to be announced in mid-September.","Major Apple announcement scheduled for September 12 in San Francisco .

Two vast tent cities are to be set up on Pacific islands to house the hundreds of asylum seekers expected to make their way to Australia in coming weeks. The decision to call in the troops to set up the canvas homes on Manus island, off Papua New Guinea, and on Nauru island in the Pacific came as the Australian parliament agreed today to stop boat people reaching the nation’s shores on ill-equipped boats. Parliament approved laws to bring into play off-shore processing of asylum seekers – and the legislation is expected to be passed by the Senate on Thursday. Outraged: Supporters of the Refugee Action Coalition protest outside Sydney Immigration Office as they demonstrate against new legislation that will reopen offshore processing centres on Nauru and Manus Island . Protest: Speakers at the Refugee Action Coalition protest use a megaphone to address the crowd . The tents will house the asylum seekers until disused detention centres on the two islands, abandoned in 2008, can be refurbished. Once broken doors and fences have been repaired and air conditioning units installed, would-be migrants would be checked out in the what are currently run-down concrete structures before they could be considered to be suitable to live in Australia. Prime Minister Julia Gillard said she had been advised that the troops would be able to set off for the islands almost immediately . Despite the unattractive prospect of living in tents for what will be weeks, asylum seekers waiting to board boats in Indonesia told local reporters today that they would still be prepared to risk their lives at sea for the chance of an eventual better life. It is expected that preparing the facilities to hold up to 2,100 asylum seekers will cost at least £350 million. Before the tent cities plan was approved, the government had even considered loading asylum seekers onto hired ships – floating islands – until the detention centres could be repaired. The troops are expected to start the task of assessing the state of the detention centres on Manus island – which was abandoned in 2004 – and on Nauru, which was closed in 2008, by the end of this week. Labour Prime Minister Julia Gillard said she had been advised that the troops would be able to set off for the islands almost immediately. She said Defence Force chief General David Hurley had told her that ‘within a month we would hope to see people being processed in Nauru and in PNG (Papua New Guinea).’ She added that the temporary facilities would involve tents and ‘other sorts of temporary structures’. But immigration experts have told of their concerns about housing would-be migrants in tents, when there were problems such as riots in permanent detention centres on Australian territory. Risky: A boat laden with refugees was driven onto rocks at Christmas Island in December 2010, killing many of those on board . Reduced to tears: Asylum seekers from Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran had to be rescued after their wooden boat began to sink off the coast of Indonesia in April . On Nauru, local people have raided the abandoned detention centres and taken away air conditioners and other furnishings and in one case an entire hut has been broken down and carted off. After parliament passed the bill to allow offshore processing today, Immigration Minister Chris Bowen said this was not the end of efforts to deal with people smuggling. ‘This is not the end of the efforts to deal with what is the very, very, very, very pernicious trade of people smuggling, which trades on people’s lives and gives people the expectation that in return for very significant sums of money they can be brought to Australia for passage.’","Manus island, off Papua New Guinea, and on Nauru island in the Pacific are both selected .

On the job: Speaker John Bercow has called critics bitter about their own failings as politicians . Commons Speaker John Bercow has taken a swipe at MPs who criticise him, accusing them of being ‘embittered and resentful’ because their own careers have stalled. The former Conservative launched a tirade against his Parliamentary detractors, saying MPs were still ‘sulking’ three years after he got the job. The Buckingham MP said: ‘Sometimes people who perhaps haven’t achieved what they want to achieve in their political career can display some sign of resentment. ‘Not necessarily because they themselves wanted to be Speaker, but because they feel, “Well, my talents haven’t been recognised. That fellow was a rather free-wheeling, independent-minded” – perhaps even, in their minds – “disloyal backbench member, and suddenly he pops up as Speaker. And we don’t like it”.’ Mr Bercow told BBC Radio 4’s The World At One that he did not bear any grudges towards MPs who had not voted for him to become Speaker but said ‘they shouldn’t, three years on, be sulking about who won’. In an extraordinary interview, Mr Bercow admitted that ‘I occasionally lost my rag’ with critics but said he tried not to get too angry as ‘you should never lose self-control’. Mr Bercow has faced accusations that he is unfairly harsh on Tories while favouring Labour during Commons exchanges. He drew fury for allowing Labour MP Chris Bryant to call Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt a ‘liar’ and failing to ask him to retract the insult. Loving husband: Mr Bercow defended his wife Sally from 'no-hopers' who criticise her and her actions . Frank: Sally Bercow revealed the couple's bedroom secrets while wearing nothing but a sheet in an interview with the Evening Standard last year . Mr Bercow let slip that he had sought expert advice from the senior Commons clerk before the exchange in anticipation that such a term might have been used. But he denied Mr Bryant had tipped him off. The Speaker also angered Tory MPs by hauling David Cameron before the Commons to answer Labour questions over Mr Hunt’s handling of Rupert Murdoch’s bid to take control of broadcaster BSkyB. He said: ‘Much as I have the highest respect for the Prime Minister... the Prime Minister’s job is to captain his team, his party, his government; my job is to be the referee.’ Mr Bercow also said he was ‘supremely uninterested’ in much of what was written in newspapers, before launching into a lengthy attack on the Press. Claims: She also appeared on Big Brother, pictured, and said she seduced her husband to let her go on . ‘Their utterances are absolutely of no interest to me whatsoever,’ he said. ‘I’m sorry to disappoint them, but they’re just not important.’ He defended his wife Sally – a Labour activist and reality TV star  who is frequently in the headlines for her antics – as ‘my asset’, declaring: ‘Above all she’s my wife, whom I love’. Mr Bercow called her critics  ‘no-hopers’ and ‘the sort of people who  wouldn’t dare to debate the issue in any very public way’, adding: ‘They certainly wouldn’t take me on.’ He said some people thought he was ‘genuine and down-to-earth’ but admitted others thought he was ‘puffed up with his own importance’.","He also said that people who tried to stop him getting the job are 'sulking' three years later .

Paul Ryan had a rocky first solo day of campaigning since joining Mitt Romney’s presidential ticket when he had to cut a speech short after hecklers interrupted him at the Iowa State Fair. He had spent only a few moments on the soapbox when several hecklers began shouting about his proposed Medicare reforms, two of whom attempted to jump on the stage with him. Attempting to brush off the interruption by bonding with the crowd over his Midwestern roots, Congressman Ryan tried to move past the issue as three people were eventually escorted out of the area by state police. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Addressing the crowd: Paul Ryan attended the Iowa State Fair as his first solo appearance since being selected as Mitt Romney's running mate on Saturday . Candidate interrupted: Two female hecklers began shouting about his proposed Medicare cuts shortly after Ryan began speaking and he brushed the incident off saying they must not be Iowans because Iowans are polite . ‘You know it’s funny because Iowans and Wisconsinites, we like to be respectful of one another and listen to each other. These ladies must not be from Iowa or Wisconsin,’ he said to the crowd. When one of the female protesters tried to get on the stage, Ryan appeared startled- ‘Hey, alright!’ he said- before the remainder of the crowd urged him on with chants of ‘USA! USA!’ In spite of his efforts to get back on track, Ryan did end up speaking for only 12 minutes instead of the customary 20 minutes. A spokesman from the Iowa State Police told Buzzfeed that none of the three hecklers were removed from the fair, simply from the area where Ryan was speaking, and none of them were arrested. Ryan’s visit to the Iowa State Fair was his first solo campaign event following a weekend of joint appearances following the announcement of his selection as the Republican vice presidential candidate on Saturday. The move comes as little surprise since Iowa is a pivotal swing state that was won by President Obama in 2008. Waiting his turn: Ryan briefly paused as the two women (and one male heckler) were escorted out of the area . Taken out: Iowa State Police confirmed that three people- including these two women- were removed from the area but none of them were arrested and they were allowed to stay at the fair . During their interview with CBS on Sunday, Romney and Ryan said that they would be spending much of the campaign apart in an effort to double their forces and cover more ground. Romney said that the addition of Ryan to the ticket was a way to even the playing field as he has been campaigning by himself against President Obama and Vice President Biden up until now. In that same vein, Ryan and Obama battled it out for coverage today as they were both in Iowa and though they did not run into each other at any point, they made a point to pass messages through their supporters. ‘As you see the president come through in his bus tour, you might ask him the same question that I'm getting asked from people all around America. And that is, “Where are the jobs, Mr. President?”’ Ryan said after the furvor died down as the hecklers were removed. The President spent much of his time in the state looking at the damage caused by the continuing drought and talking to some of the state’s many farmers about the proposed plan to use $170million in federal aid to provide short-term relief to those impacted by the record-breaking heat. Popular state: President Obama began his bus tour in Iowa on the same day and focused his rhetoric on a proposed bill that would provide $170m in assistance to drought-riddled farmers . Introducing himself: Ryan tried to connect with fair-goers over their shared Midwestern roots . In keeping with his strategy of painting Ryan as a Republican ‘idealogue’ that has prevented Congressional compromise, Obama talked about the opposition that the bill faces in Congress. ‘I’m told Gov. Romney's new running mate might be around Iowa these next few days, and he's one of those leaders of Congress standing in the way,’ Obama said. ‘So if you happen to see Congressman Ryan, tell him how important this farm bill is to Iowa and our rural communities. We've got to put politics aside and do right thing for rural America and Iowa.’ Considering Ryan’s Midwestern roots- and the importance of the swing state- the Iowa State Fair comes as a predictable first outing for the Congressman. The fair has also had a special place in the Romney campaign’s timeline, as it was at the same event last year when the former Governor made the much-publicized comment that ‘corporations are people too, my friend’. During his brief interaction with fairgoers as he walked to and from the stage, he highlighted his interest in similar activities. ‘We do cow milking contests in Wisconsin,’ Ryan said. He said that he also enjoyed watching demolition derbies. WATCH THE VIDEO HERE .","Mitt Romney's VP pick stumped in Iowa on Monday and was interrupted .

"By . James Nye . PUBLISHED: . 10:23 EST, 16 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:03 EST, 16 August 2012 . Charges have been dropped against a fugitive doctor involved in the nation's largest prosecution of Internet pharmacies because there's too much evidence - more than 400,000 documents and two terabytes of electronic data that federal authorities say is expensive to maintain. In a move which will raise eyebrows, the nine-year investigation against Armando Angulo who was indicted in 2007 for an illegal multimillion dollar internet drugs scheme has ended. A federal judge in Iowa dismissed the charge last week at the request of prosecutors, who want to throw out the many records collected over their nine-year investigation to free up space. In this undated photo provided by the Office of the Attorney General of Florida is Miami Dr. Armando Angulo who is escaping prosecution because of the huge volume of evidence in his case: more than 400,000 documents and two terabytes of electronic data . The Miami doctor fled to his native Panama after coming under investigation in 2004, and Panamanian authorities say they do not extradite their own citizens. Given the unlikelihood of capturing Angulo and the inconvenience of maintaining so much evidence, prosecutors gave up the long pursuit. 'Continued storage of these materials is difficult and expensive,' wrote Stephanie Rose, the U.S. attorney for northern Iowa. She called the task 'an economic and practical hardship' for the Drug Enforcement Administration. The case started in 2003 with a raid of a small Iowa drugstore and eventually secured the conviction of 26 defendants, including 19 doctors. The Union Family Pharmacy in Dubuque, Iowa, which was closed after authorities found evidence that it had illegally dispensed drugs on the Internet . The investigation dismantled two Internet pharmacies that illegally sold 30 million pills to customers. Investigators also recovered $7 million, most of which went to Iowa police agencies that helped with the case. When a major drug suspect flees the country, federal authorities often leave the charges pending in the event the fugitive tries to sneak back into the U.S. or a country with a friendly extradition process. But in Angulo's case, the volume of evidence posed a bigger burden. The evidence took up 5 percent of the DEA's worldwide electronic storage. Agents had also kept several hundred boxes of paper containing 440,000 documents, plus dozens of computers, servers and other bulky items. Two terabytes is enough to store the text of 2 million novels, or roughly 625,000 copies of 'War and Peace.' Two-terabyte memory drives are widely available for $100, but the DEA's data server must be relatively small and may need replacement, a costly and risky proposition for an agency that must maintain the integrity of documents, said University of Iowa computer scientist Douglas Jones. This Sept. 12, 2003 photo shows customers outside the Union Family Pharmacy in Dubuque, Iowa, after it was closed by federal agents that found evidence it had illegally dispensed drugs on the Internet . 'A responsible organization doesn't upgrade every time new technology is available. That's all they would be doing,' Jones said. 'But the result is you end up in situations like this where the capacity they have is not quite up to the incredible volume of data involved.' Randy Stock, who runs the website whatsabyte.com, which explains electronic storage, said he doubted that storing the data would have been that problematic for the government. 'I'm thinking that excuse is just their easy way out,' he wrote in an e-mail. U.S. District Judge Linda Reade dismissed the case with prejudice, meaning it cannot be refiled. Angulo, 59, was accused of improperly authorizing thousands of prescriptions for pain pills, diet medication and other drugs while working for Pharmacom International Corp., a Florida-based Internet company that operated from 2003 to 2004. The company's doctors approved prescriptions without examining patients, communicating with them or verifying their identities, prosecutors said. In these Sept. 12, 2003 photo investigators enter the Union Family Pharmacy in Dubuque, Iowa, which was closed after authorities found evidence that it had illegally dispensed drugs on the Internet . Three Pharmacom officials and a person who recruited doctors were sentenced to prison. Eight physicians pleaded guilty to conspiracy to illegally distribute controlled substances and launder the proceeds. The investigation began after agents raided the Union Family Pharmacy in Dubuque and found evidence that it had illegally dispensed medication for Pharmacom and another Internet company, Medical Web Services, which pleaded guilty. Eleven of its physicians were also prosecuted. Angulo fled to Panama around the time Florida regulators suspended his medical license for prescribing controlled substances to Medicaid patients 'in excessive quantities and without medical justification.' An audit found his prescriptions cost Medicaid $6.5 million over six years and caused addiction and dangerous health risks. Investigators know Angulo's whereabouts in Panama, which has an extradition treaty with the U.S. to return fugitives. But a spokeswoman for the Panamanian Embassy in Washington said the country never received a formal extradition petition for Angulo and that the country's constitution bars the extradition of Panamanian citizens. The dismissal of the charges does not mean Angulo is free to return to the U.S. He is still listed as one of Florida's most wanted criminals and is being sought for separate Medicaid fraud and narcotics charges in that state.","Armando Angulo was charged with running two Internet pharmacies that illegally sold 30 million pills to customers in 2003.

The Government’s failure to crack down on Britain’s benefits cheats has been exposed in a damning TV documentary. The programme shows one young man filling in his Jobseeker’s claim form by copying down his weekly shopping list. Another submits a CV and  application letter as evidence that he was trying to seek work, yet both clearly state he does not want a job. In both cases, the claims were passed. Working the system: C4's undercover reporter Morland Sanders, pictured driving with Alay Paun, said it was 'all too easy' to cheat the benefits system . Joe Paxton, 25, uses a hidden camera to show a Jobcentre Plus adviser in Shropshire rubber-stamping his claim for Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA), having failed to spot that it was a simply a list of food items. Claimants over 25 can receive up to £71. Mr Paxton, who was working undercover with television reporter Morland Sanders, said: ‘I’m supposed to write a list of  14 things I’ve done each week  to find work but no one ever  bothers to check it, so it was no surprise when I submitted my shopping list instead and they didn’t even notice.’ He graduated in 2009 from Aberystwyth University, where he read genetics, but has been signing on ever since. He says he is becoming increasingly disillusioned with the system. ‘We do all that is asked of us but what is the point if they are just going to ignore it?’ says Mr Paxton. ‘This shows just how easy it is to stay on benefits if you want to and begs the question how seriously staff actually take their role in finding people like me work.’ In order to obtain JSA, claimants must enter into an agreement with an employment officer to highlight the attempts they have made to find work each week. The terms can vary from centre to centre. But the system’s potential for farce is . further highlighted by 30-year-old unemployed events manager Alay Paun. Under the terms of his agreement, he has to apply for three jobs each . week and then show his adviser, via his mobile phone, copies of what he . sent. However, working with Sanders, he altered . the copies to say he didn’t want the job because he preferred to stay . on benefits and changed the last line of his CV so it read:  ‘Please . don’t give me the job, I don’t want it.’ Yet the adviser at his . Jobcentre in Dalston,  North-East London, didn’t spot the glaring . anomalies. 'Farce': The programme shows Joe Paxton writing a shopping list out on his claim form for Jobseeker's Allowance - the claim was passed . ‘She scrolled through my emails on my mobile and my claim was passed for another week, within five minutes of me walking in,’ says the Sussex University graduate, who had been out of work  for five months when the film was made. In April this year, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg praised  Jobcentres, claiming that they offered the unemployed the chance to either ‘earn or learn’. But with more than 2½ million unemployed in Britain and a further 500,000 school and university leavers about to flood the job market, the documentary casts serious doubt on their effectiveness. The cost of people working cash-in-hand while still fraudulently claiming benefits runs to more than £226 million a year and Jobcentre Plus staff are seen as the first line of defence.  Yet when Mr Paun goes into the Jobcentre to sign on wearing paint-splattered overalls and looking like a professional decorator, his adviser readily accepts that he’s painting his bedroom. 'Satisfied': Ruth Owen, the chief operating officer of Jobcentre Plus, said she was satisfied staff were doing enough to get people into work . Martin Archer, who worked as a Jobcentre Plus adviser until last year, admits: ‘Filling out a fraud referral form can take time, so unless you’ve got a very supportive manager and unless you’ve not got a busy diary, you’re going to be tempted to just let it go under the carpet. When I was there, not enough fraud referrals were being done.’ Mr Archer adds that if he were out of work and keen to find a job, he wouldn’t start at the Jobcentre. He said claimants were often penalised for using their initiative, meaning many of those who had, for instance, secured unpaid work experience would have their benefits stopped. ‘There is no guidance on this. You do get to this ludicrous situation where somebody has found themselves a great opportunity, and the Jobcentre just doesn’t know how to process it. Most of my colleagues would err on the side of caution and they would classify internships as work. Ruth Owen, chief operating officer for Jobcentre Plus, claims there is plenty of help available for Britain’s unemployed but admits: ‘I am disappointed we haven’t picked up the silly mistakes that Joe and Alay highlighted. But I am satisfied that Jobcentre Plus is getting people into work and ensuring they meet their responsibilities.’ She appears baffled when asked why 127 jobs based in Jobcentre Plus itself are advertised on  neither the centres’ terminals nor their own website. She later said that Jobcentre staff knew about them and could pass the information on to claimants. But says Channel 4 Dispatches reporter Sanders: ‘Jobcentre Plus seems ill-equipped to do what it was set up for, which is to find people jobs. ‘From our discussions with Joe, Alay and many other job-seekers, if you want to, it is still all too easy to cheat the system.’ Dispatches: Tricks Of  The Dole Cheats, Channel 4, tomorrow, 8pm.","A Channel 4 documentary shows Jobcentre advisers failing to notice deliberately farcical entries on claim forms for Jobseeker's Allowance .

A 10-year-old girl was lost in America's second-biggest airport because an airline worker forgot to pick her up at the gate and flight attendants repeatedly refused to help because they were busy. Phoebe Klebahn was flying from her hometown of San Francisco to Chicago where she was scheduled to make a connection and fly to Grand Rapids, Michigan for summer camp. Like a scene out of Home Alone 2, the young girl was lost in Chicago's O'Hare airport and missed her connecting flight. Familiar story: Like in Home Alone 2 where the main character is lost in Chicago's O'Hare airport, Phoebe Klebahn missed her flight to summer camp . Multiple mistakes: A friend of the girl's parents told how United did not contact the family until the case gained media attention . Phoebe's parents only found out that their daughter had trouble with the airline once a camp counselor called to say that the girl never showed up. The incident became public after a friend of the couple wrote about their trouble with United on his blog, bringing the plight of Annie and Perry Klebahn who tried to understand how their daughter was left to fend for herself in the airport. After an estimated 18 hours of phone calls with United Airlines as they searched for answers, the Klebahns found out that the escorts that the company uses to collect and drop off unaccompanied minors during solo flights are actually managed by a third-party service. In their daughter's case, the representative didn't show up at the gate in Chicago because they forgot about her. On top of that failure, the United attendants who were on the plane were 'busy and could not help' the confused girl as she waited for the escort. 'She asked three times to use a phone to call us and they told her to wait. When she missed the flight she asked if someone had called camp to make sure they knew and they told her ""yes—we will take care of it"".  No one did,' the parents wrote in a letter of complaint to the airline that was reposted on their friend Bob Sutton's blog. Concerned parent: Perry Klebahn, a professor at Stanford University, wrote a letter of complaint that went unanswered and estimates that he and his wife have spent 18 hours on the phone over the issue . Maze: Phoebe flew from San Francisco (left) to Chicago (right) where she was supposed to have an employee escort her to her connecting flight, but the person never showed up . 'She was sad and scared and no one helped.' The Huffington Post reports that eventually, Phoebe was put on a flight to Michigan four hours later, and because of the confusion her bags were lost and they took three more days to be reconnected with her at camp. Previous career: Before becoming a professor, Perry Klebahn apparently modeled for Gap . On his blog, Mr Sutton tells of how his friend and colleague Perry, who is a professor at Stanford University, has been continually frustrated by United's treatment and dismissal of the gravity of the situation. When on the phone with one customer service representative while Phoebe was still wandering around the Chicago airport unaccompanied, the representative almost hung up saying that she could be of no more help because her shift was about to end. A maternal plea from Mrs Khelban eventually prompted the worker to spend 15 minutes tracking the young girl down herself. Mr Sutton says that United was 'completely unresponsive' until the couple told a local reporter about the incident and she started asking questions. After that pressure, an airline representative contacted them directly and released a statement apologizing for their alleged actions. 'We reached out directly to the Klebahns to apologize and we are reviewing this matter,' United said in a statement to The Huffington Post. 'What the Klebahns describe is not the service we aim to deliver to our customers. We are redepositing the miles used to purchase the ticket back into Mr. Klebahn’s account in addition to refunding the unaccompanied minor charge.' Phoebe told her parents that she never wants to fly United again.","Phoebe Klebahn, 10, was traveling from San Francisco to summer camp in Michigan with a layover in Chicago, and an unaccompanied minor escort was supposed to meet her at the gate .

The body of a missing woman was discovered by police divers on Saturday as her devastated mother watched from the shore clinging to a photograph of her daughter. Rebecca Weiss was found a week after she disappeared about 200 yards off the Terranea Resort in Rancho Palos Verdes, Los Angeles County, a favorite dive spot for her and her husband. The 50-year-old's belongings were found near the rocky coastline after she was reported missing on August 11  by her husband, Alan Weiss - who the victim's mother, Vilma Causey, claims was having an affair and did not help look for her. Scroll down for video . Found: Rebecca Weiss' body was recovered from the water where California diver is said to have gone missing one week ago . Identity:LA Country Coroner's office confirmed the identity of Rebecca Weiss whose family were huddled by the shore as her body was recovered . Scene: Mrs Weiss was said by her husband to have gone diving solo at their favorite location, pictured, on the day he last saw her . Weiss' mother, with the support of family members excluding Weiss' husband, has been canvassing the area relentlessly with her 50-year-old daughter’s picture sinceshe first disappeared. Police said they are investigating both Weiss' death and an apparent drowning in the same area. Coroner's investigator Elissa Fleak says an autopsy will be conducted Sunday. Mr Weiss told sheriff's detectives he last saw his wife driving away from their Marina del Rey home wearing a wetsuit and that Mrs Weiss was an experienced free-diver. Mrs Weiss' mother and brother were near the resort passing out fliers when the body was found. By 2.15pm the Los Angeles County Department of Coroner launched an investigation at the scene, according to Lt. Larry Diet, accompanying homicide investigators who were present when the body was pulled from the water. Clues: Mrs Weiss's husband of 20 years, Alan Weiss, pictured beside her, has not been listed as a suspect and has been cooperating with authorities according to police . Devastated: Rebecca's mother Vilma Causey, left, was on the shore when the body was pulled from the water, having never stopped searching for her only daughter . Suspicious: Her brother Bob Causey believes something extraordinary must have happened to his sister if she was in the water as she was wearing a wet suit and a strong swimmer . Police had been searching for Mrs Weiss after she did not return home from a believed solo . diving expedition at a location her husband described as being the couple's favorite location. Homicide detectives had interviewed . her husband and said he has been cooperating so far with the investigation and is not named a suspect. But investigators say unusual circumstances related to her disappearance have led them to reclassify the case from a missing person investigation to a homicide. Life together: Rebecca Weiss co-owned two businesses with her husband but recently, according to her mother, said she believed her husband was having an affair . Police interest in the husband comes after the mother of the missing businesswoman who said her daughter suspected he was having an affair after 20 years of marriage. Her mother told KTLA 5 that her daughter confided in her shortly before she disappeared that she suspected her 60-year-old husband was engaged in an extramarital relationship. Vilma Causey said: 'My daughter told me that she found it on the computer... He has a girlfriend.' As well as this, she said that while they are doing everything they can to find her daughter - including passing out flyers in the area - Mr Weiss had done nothing to help, which the family think is strange. She said of Mr Weiss behavior: 'Very bad, very strange. That is . not the reaction of a person that has somebody missing that is close to . you. 'Was she the only one on the beach to swim? Especially at that resort? No one saw her? No one saw her?' Mrs Causey also revealed her daughter's cell phone and keys are missing, but her credit cards and driving license were found. Her brother Bob Causey also said it is hard to believe something could have gone wrong. 'My sister is a strong swimmer, and she was wearing a wetsuit, according to my brother-in-law.' Mr Causey said: 'So it would have to be something out of the extraordinary for something to happen to her out there.' Husband: Alan Weiss is accused of doing nothing to help find his wife and is said to have been having an affair . Free diving is a form of underwater diving that does not involve the use of scuba gear or other external breathing devices. Instead, it relies on a diver's ability to hold his or her breath until resurfacing. The couple were married 20 years . and seemed happy, according to friends, who said they traveled the . world and enjoyed their diving hobby together. Mrs Weiss co-owned two grocery . businesses with her husband. Her mother said: 'There has to be somebody who must have seen. This is not an isolated place. This is a resort. There should have been people.' Her . clothes and other belongings were found near her BMW X5, which was . parked at the Terennea resort on the Palos Verdes Peninsula. Mr Weiss told the LA Weekly blog . that his wife was ‘very experienced’ at free-diving, a discipline that . does not involve using any scuba gear and relies on the ability to hold . breath for up to three minutes. Those . who practice it are at risk of blacking out from running out of breath . and the sport is extremely dangerous without supervision.

A catalogue of police failings allowed a sadistic killer to murder his ex-partner and daughter, an investigation has found. Officers took 'inadequate action' to arrest David Oakes, 50, before he shot Christine Chambers, 38, and Shania, two, at their home in Braintree, Essex, the police watchdog concluded. Oakes, of Steeple, near Maldon, was given two whole-life jail terms after being found guilty of the murders, which happened in June last year. Scroll down for video . Sadistic: The Independent Police Complaints Commission found police took 'inadequate action' to arrest former nightclub bouncer David Oakes. He is pictured, left, in a police photograph taken prior to him murdering Christine Chambers and daughter Shania, and, right, baring his injured face last year after shooting himself following the savage killings . It emerged during his trial at . Chelmsford Crown Court that police had visited either his address or . Miss Chambers' home six times in the two years before the murders. The trial heard that Oakes stormed Ms . Chambers’ house and blasted her and their daughter Shania with a . shotgun just weeks after the family gained a restraining order against . him. He then shot himself in the face, but survived. The court heard that Oakes 'systematically tortured' Ms Chambers for several hours before the killings, forcing her to strip and cutting chunks from her hair. Ms Chambers' 10-year-old daughter fled the house during the ordeal as police outside attempted to negotiate with the killer. The couple, who had a long history of domestic abuse, were due to appear at a court custody hearing the next day. A damning report released today by . the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) concludes that Essex . Police missed chances to arrest Oakes before the killings. The IPCC investigation found a lack . of adequate training, insufficient resources allocated to domestic . violence cases and poor oversight by the force. It said inadequate action was taken . to arrest Oakes at the earliest opportunity when reports were made of . him breaching a non-molestation order. Killed: Christine Chambers and her daughter Shania were murdered at their Essex home in June 2011 . A catalogue of incidents involving . the couple reported to police over a two-year period were treated in . isolation by officers. The force failed to take into . consideration the possibility that Ms Chambers had not pursued . complaints against Oakes because she was scared of him, the . investigation found. Ms Chambers made a higher number of . calls to police in the two months before the murders, but the force . failed to respond properly, the report stated. Ms Chambers' father Ken praised Essex Police for its support during the murder investigation but said he felt the force could have done more to prevent the deaths. He said: 'As a family we would again like to say thank you to all those, including friends and neighbours, who have shown us such support and kindness since the murders of Christine and Shania. 'We have also received marvellous support from the police murder investigation team led by Detective Chief Inspector O'Toole, from police family liaison officers and the victim support service, and we are grateful to all of them for helping us through such a traumatic time. 'We have been kept informed by the IPCC of their investigation and findings and have had opportunity to read through and discuss their report. 'We realise one evil man is responsible for taking Christine and Shania away from us and not having them in our lives any more remains extremely difficult to bear. 'While we understand at times Christine could have been more cooperative with the police, we do feel that Essex Police could have done more to prevent the deaths; they should have taken greater steps to protect Christine. 'Difficult to bear': Christine Chambers' father Ken, pictured with the victim's mother Jean during the trial, praised Essex Police for its support during the murder investigation but said he felt the force could have done more to prevent the deaths . 'For instance, we are still of the view she should have had a panic alarm installed at her home which may have allowed her to summon assistance at a crucial time after her phones had been smashed. 'And we think that officers dealing with ongoing incidents should have been more aware of the history and should have better identified the risks.' The IPCC said that, while individual . officers could have done things better, it was a failure of police . systems rather than of individuals. IPCC Commissioner Rachel Cerfontyne said: 'The deaths of Christine and Shania Chambers are shocking to us all. 'It is impossible to say with any . certainty whether if individual officers or the force had done things . differently, Ms Chambers and Shania would still be alive today. 'While individual police officers . could and should have done things better, this is not essentially a . failure of individuals, but a failure of systems. 'The investigation identified a lack . of adequate training, insufficient resources allocated to domestic . violence cases and poor oversight. Murdered: Christine Chambers and her daughter, Shania, two, were shot dead at close range with a shotgun . 'This is a tragic and disturbing case . and the investigation has identified several key issues which apply to . many other cases where domestic homicide is the outcome. 'Many women are reluctant to pursue criminal proceedings against abusive partners, sometimes even to seek help at all. 'There are many reasons for this, and . often it is fear that they will exacerbate the situation and increase . the danger they face. 'Undoubtedly this poses significant . challenges for the police and other agencies, but it is essential in . these situations that all possible is done to protect the victims and . their children. 'Unwillingness to seek help or give . evidence against the perpetrator is often due to fear and can be a sign . of vulnerability, not culpability, and this must be recognised when a . risk assessment is completed.' Responding to the report, which was . released today, Essex Police said it accepted the findings and . apologised for the failings which had been identified. Assistant . Chief Constable Maurice Mason said: 'On behalf of everyone at Essex . Police, I extend our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of . Christine and Shania Chambers, who were brutally murdered by David Oakes . in the early hours of June 6, 2011. 'Essex Police accepts the findings of the IPCC report, and apologises for the failures identified there. 'Every . police officer involved in the case of Christine and Shania is . devastated by their passing. I too am devastated by their deaths. I . became a police officer to protect the vulnerable, and to put criminals . like Oakes behind bars. 'Essex Police is committed to working tirelessly to reduce the likelihood of tragedies such as this from occurring again.' He . added: 'The unbelievable inhumanity of these murders led Oakes to be . sentenced to two whole-life prison terms - the most extreme punishment . which the British judicial system can impose. 'You . would think that a man capable of such horror would have a history of . violence. Oakes did not: he had no convictions or cautions for violence. Murder weapon: The shotgun used by David Oakes to kill his partner and their two-year-old daughter . 'In fact, the IPCC has found that significant 'information concerning Oakes's violence towards Christine Chambers was not available to the police or social services. 'The IPCC also stated that there was no information that Oakes had access to a firearm. 'Essex Police acts promptly and decisively whenever it receives credible intelligence about illegally-held weapons. 'Essex Police accepts the report of the IPCC and welcomes the recommendation that processes should be developed for better information sharing between police forces and agencies such as social services, courts and solicitors. 'This is particularly important in cases involving child custody proceedings, where allegations of domestic violence have not been reported to officers. 'It should be stressed that the IPCC investigation found that it is impossible to say with any certainty that, if the force had done things differently, Christine and Shania would be alive today. 'It also found no evidence of misconduct by any of our officers.' Earlier this year, Essex Police apologised for its failings in a chillingly similar murder case. The force was reprimanded for its handling of the murder of Maria Stubbings - who was killed by her ex-partner in 2008. Maria, 50, was strangled to death with a dog lead in her Chelmsford home by convicted killer Marc Chivers just days after she had phoned Essex Police saying she was in danger. An IPCC report into Maria's murder concluded that the mother-of-two's death was 'predictable and preventable' and that she had been 'badly let down' by police. Ms Stubbings had phoned police to say she suspected Chivers had tried to break into her home, but the incident was not logged as domestic violence and was there not given a high priority.

Being told off at kindergarten for his Michigan University T-Shirt has led this little boy to become the team’s hero. Cooper Barton, 5, has been invited to appear in front of thousands of fans at a football match after he made headlines this week when told to turn his ‘Big House’ T-Shirt inside out because strict rules forbid him from wearing clothes from any universities outside Oklahoma, the state he lives in. A teacher told Cooper he was violating the Oklahoma City Public Schools’ clothing policy but his mother, Shannon Barton, decided to challenge the rules, contacting the school and media. University's hero: Cooper Barton, 5, was told off for wearing this T-Shirt supporting Michigan University's football team at his Oklahoma school . She told KWTV: 'They should really worry about academics. It wasn't offensive. He's five.' On ABC News she said: ‘I was angry my son felt a little embarrassed. ‘He didn’t understand why he had to turn his shirt inside-out. ‘Our point was why do you allow one and not the other? Every day kids are wearing (Oklahoma City) Thunder shirts and no one ever makes them turn their shirt. Surprise invite: Cooper's family were pleasantly surprised when Michigan University invited them to a match after the story gained wide media attention . Taking on schools rules: Cooper's parents Chris and Shannon Barton believe the rule which prevents students from wearing university clothing from any institutions outside Oklahoma is a double standard . The mission was championed by Michigan fans prompting the university’s athletic director David Brandon to invite Cooper and his family to the September 15 game at the 'big house', the very stadium Cooper's T-Shirt displayed in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Mr Brandon also offered to introduce the boy to the crowd at half time. A new, improved T-Shirt was also made for Cooper that, even when turned inside out, still displays the university logo. University hero: Cooper will be introduced to fans at half time at the Michigan University match at their stadium in Ann Arbor . Mrs Barton and her husband plan to attend a school board meeting on September 10 to fight what she sees as a double standard. She said: ‘What’s good for one should be good for all. ‘This is a military town, with Chesapeake Energy, the hospital. Not everybody is from Oklahoma so they should be allowed to wear what they like.’ Given the media attention, school district officials have said that they are re-evaluating the clothing ban which has been in place for seven years. Inside out Michigan: The university's athletic director David Brandon presented a T-Shirt displaying the Michigan logo inside and out just for Cooper . The rule was put in place to combat fears that American gangs used popular sports clothing to represent specific gangs. The school district’s superintendent Karl Springer said in a statement: ‘In cooperation with the Oklahoma City Police Department Gang Task Force, the policy was approved in 2005 after concerns that nationwide gangs used popular sports clothing to represent individual gangs. ‘As when any policy is questioned; OKCPS administration will review the policy to determine if changes need to be made.’ When asked if Cooper might end up attending Michigan University, Mrs Barton joked: ‘I don’t think he has a choice.","Cooper Barton was told off for wearing a Michigan University T-Shirt at his Oklahoma kindergarten .

A 28-year-old waitress from Seal Beach, California, said a manager at the restaurant where she works has denied her the right to pump breast milk while on the job because he deemed the act ‘disgusting.’ Kristen Joseph, a single mother of a six-month-old son, Wrigley, has worked at Hennessey's Tavern in Seal Beach for three years. Since the birth of her child, Joseph said she would take a 10-minute break once a day to pump breast milk in the privacy of a manager’s office, the station KTLA reported. Barred: Kristen Joseph, pictured here with her son, Wrigley, claims that her manager refused to let her pump breast milk on the job because he deemed it 'disgusting' Workplace: Joseph would usually take a 10-minute break from her job as a waitress in Hennessey's Tavern in Seal Beach to express milk . ‘If I don't pump, then my breasts are very engorged and they hurt and they leak,’ Joseph explained. But on Monday, the on-duty manager refused to give the young mother the keys to his office, saying that pumping breast milk anywhere in the restaurant, even in the restroom, is ‘disgusting’ because ‘people eat there.’ ‘He said he didn’t want me to spray all over his office. I was just appalled at what he had to say,’  Joseph told CBS. The 28-year-old server said her boss . told her she could leave, but she still had some work left to do and . decided to stay on duty, at which point her breast milk started leaking . through her shirt. Joseph says if she doesn't use the pump, right, her breasts become engorged and start leaking, which is what happened when she was barred from expressing milk on the job . Confrontation: Joseph says an on-duty manager refused to give her the keys to his office because he was afraid she would spray milk everywhere . Federal law requires any business employing 50 or more people to set aside an area -- other than a bathroom -- for women to express breast milk. It also allows women to nurse their children anywhere, at any time, in any public place. Hennessey's is a chain with 10 locations in Southern California and Las Vegas. Joseph called her general manager to . complain about the incident, but still has not heard back. She has since . contacted Hennessey's corporate offices and was told the company is looking into the allegations. A spokesperson for Hennessey's told . the Daily Mail in a phone interview on Thursday that it is a . company-wide policy to provide a safe and secure environment for all . their working mothers to expel milk. Mothers' rights: Federal law requires any employer with 50 or more workers to set aside a private area for women to pump breast milk . ‘We believe this to be a misunderstanding about where this space was provided for her,’ the spokesperson said in reference to Ms Joseph. Since Joseph lodged a complaint with the corporate offices, the company has launched a full-scale investigation into the 'miscommunication' between the manager and the server, according to the Hennessey's representative. The 28-year-old waitress said she wants to use this opportunity to raise awareness of the rights of women in general and mothers in particular. ‘It’s just unfair,’ Joseph said. ‘This is 2012, and it’s not time to discriminate against women anymore.’","Kristen Joseph, 28, works as server at Hennessey's Tavern in Seal Beach, California .

Air conditioning units fitted at a school gym that athletes were using for training have been removed just days after the end of the Olympic games. The gym at Rokeby School in Newham, East London was known to be stiflingly hot and one teacher claimed that pupils could only use it for 15 minutes at a time because of the high temperatures. There have even been cases in the past of children fainting during PE lessons as a result of the conditions. Teachers at the school have now hit out at LOCOG as 'hypocrites' who were going against the idea of the Olympic legacy. The gymnasium at Rokeby School in deprived Newham, East London, had air con installed so athletes could train there before the Olympics . Organisers agreed to install air conditioning units in the school's gym so that volleyball teams could train in the sports hall a mile away from the Olympic stadium. But in contrast to the 'Olympic legacy' promised to East London and the rest of the capital, the generators powering the new air conditioning units were removed as soon as the Games finished. LOCOG confirmed the air conditioning units would not remain at the all-boys school, prompting critics to label the 'sporting legacy'. One teacher at the school branded the situation 'complete hypocrisy', while other staff, including the headteacher, were said to be 'very angry'. The teacher, who did not wish to be named, said LOCOG removed the air conditioning in the stifling gym even though the school offered to pay to keep it in place. Training base: LOCOG temporarily upgraded the school's gym so volleyball players could train there before competing at London 2012 . Details emerged as David Cameron said Britain needed to 'use the inspiration of the Games to get children playing sport more regularly'. A pupil at the boy’s secondary school reportedly collapsed in the sports hall and was rushed to hospital in the last week of term - just days before air conditioning was installed for the arrival of athletes. Pupils are currently limited to using the hall for 15 minutes at a time, according to teachers, one of whom went as far as saying the the building was 'making children ill'. Rokeby School, in the London borough of Newham, is just a mile from the Olympic Park in Stratford, and its students come from some of the poorest families in the capital. LOCOG, which was in charge of the school site during the Games, said the sports hall did not need permanent air conditioning because term did not fall 'during the hottest summer months.' A teacher at the school, who asked not to be named said: 'We have a lot of children getting headaches and experiencing breathing problems after playing sport in there. The building is making children ill. 'It is one of the most used buildings in the whole school and is used by after school clubs as well.' Legacy: Rokeby School is around one mile from the Olympics Stadium in East London . Simon Shaw, 53, a former teacher at Rokeby who is close friends with a number of teaching staff at the school said: 'They are furious. They wanted to keep the air conditioning but they’ve just been walked over. 'There is a big issue with ventilation in the sports hall - pupils have actually collapsed from overheating. They said the Olympics were going to bring all these benefits to children in an area that really needs them and its just rubbish. 'They bend over backwards for athletes, but as far as they are concerned children can just suffer. It is disgraceful.' A LOCOG spokeswoman said: 'The air cooling used during the Olympics is temporary. Historically it might have been needed during the hottest summer months. 'Those months are not when school normally happens, so the removal will not affect the students ability to enjoy their physical education classes during regular school months. 'We always made it clear that the facilities we were putting in were for the Games time period only. 'The air conditioning was hired by LOCOG and therefore there was no option for the school to buy from us. 'However the school did get upgrade works paid for by the Olympic delivery Authority, such as the installation of a new floor.'","Rokeby School gym had air con installed especially for volleyball stars training .

Hot, dry windy weather throughout the West, has caused fire season to start early this year and forecasters have warned that these conditions are set to continue. One blaze, which started when a utility vehicle caught fire, is now just four miles from the resort town of Featherville, in mountains around 100 miles northeast of Boise. Time to go: Lizzie Morris, 4, waits in a vehicle as her family prepares to evacuate from their home in Featherville, Idaho where a fierce wildfire was raging just four miles away . Nearly 1,000 firefighters have gathered there for a last-ditch effort to keep the flames at bay but many resident have already fled. An estimated 1,000 people in the town and nearby Pine are braced for mandatory evacuation orders and Idaho Gov. C.L. 'Butch' Otter already has issued a disaster declaration. Efforts are being concentrated on building fire breaks, clearing brush from around houses and other structures and setting up sprinkler systems, U.S. Forest Service spokesman Arnold Hartigan said. Authorities reopened roads to incoming traffic for about 12 hours overnight to allow residents who had fled to return long enough to collect their belongings.

The couple, who spent 13 years together before they separated some time ago, had a second daughter together, Becky, now 25. Mr Desmier was a musician who was well-know for playing his guitar in pubs around Bradford. Lorna said: 'We're all just in shock, my legs nearly went from under me when I found out. 'I love him to bits, he had his ways but he really was a loveable rogue. He had six children who he didn't see a lot of, but we all loved him. 'He used to enjoy playing guitar, that's how he won my mam's heart,' she added. A shocked friend said of the murder victim: ‘He was a lovely bloke, always happy.’ On . his Facebook page Mr Desmier had posted: ‘Free as a bird for the first . time in my life,’ and described himself as a ‘man of leisure’.

There are problems around here but it's basically a nice street and you don't expect this.' Det Supt Mark Ridley, from West Yorkshire Police, said: 'We have . launched a murder investigation following the discovery of Mr Desmier, . who is known locally as Butch, and are appealing for witnesses to come . forwards or anyone with any information. 'We do have evidence to suggest a . burglary may have occurred at the property in the early hours of the . 23rd and that violence may have been used in Mr Desmier’s death.

A mentally ill father stabbed his two-year-old son and wife to death because he thought the boy was the devil. David Wyn Jones, 42, of Tremadog, Gwynedd, a former insurance salesman, was sent to a secure psychiatric unit by a judge at Caernarfon crown court. He had admitted their manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Sending him to Ty Llywelyn medium secure unit at Llanfairfechan, Judge Merfyn Hughes QC told Jones : 'For many years your wife cared for you both in good and more difficult times. 'It’s clear from the evidence before me she died in a desperate but ultimately unsuccessful attempt to save the life of her child. 'William was only two, an innocent and defenceless victim. What you did to both of them was dreadful and terrifying. 'It’s to be hoped at least William was too young to fully understand the threat he was under until it was too late.'

Sixteen Amish men and women accused of cutting people's hair and beards are set to go on trial this week over the alleged hate crime. As jury selection began at a court in Cleveland on Monday, the defendants were supported by a dozen women from the community, all dressed nearly identically in traditional outfits. The accused, most of whom are related to one another, are charged in three separate attacks on nine people, including the parents of some of the suspects. Support: Amish women attending the start of the trial of 16 people accused of beard-cutting hate crime attacks . Jury selection: Monday saw the opening of the trial, whose charges date back to last autumn . The series of crimes rocked the normally quiet, pacifist Amish community in southeast Ohio. The assaults were considered especially egregious because the beard is a symbol of a man's identity among the Amish, and women in the community do not cut their hair for biblical reasons. Federal prosecutors say the attacks were revenge for a dispute between Samuel Mullet Sr and other Amish bishops after those bishops disputed the excommunication of eight families from Mullet's breakaway group. Authorities accused Mullet, 66, of being the ringleader of the assaults, although they say he was not present during any of them. Unprecedented: The Amish usually sort out their disputes within the community rather than involving goverment officials . Charges: If found guilty of a hate crime, the 16 defendants could face many years in prison . Officials said conversations recorded in jail before federal charges were brought revealed that he was planning more attacks. Mullet and the others face 10 counts, including obstruction, conspiracy and a federal hate crime, 'for willfully causing bodily injury because of actual and perceived religion'. Two defendants, Mullet and Lester Miller, have filed motions arguing that the hate crime statute, which carries a possible life sentence, does not apply to intra-religious disputes and is a violation of the separation of powers. Seven defendants, including Mullet, have been in custody since their arrest in October. Unusual: The defendants are said by some to belong to a breakaway cult hostile to other Amish . Defiant: Those accused have repeatedly rejected plea deals with prosecutors . Last week, judge Dan Polster ruled that prosecutors are not permitted to refer to Mullet's community using terms that may be derogatory, like 'cult' or 'sect,' but they will be able to present evidence of Mullet's sexual 'counselling' of female members of his group even though he has not been charged with a sex crime. Another earlier ruling allows the defence to argue that the cutting of a person's hair or beard does not constitute bodily harm even though the Amish believe married men and women must abstain from cutting their hair. Members of the Amish community will not be required to be sworn in before testifying because oath-taking is considered a violation of their religion. The judge has banned cameras and blogging from the courtroom during the trial. Leader: Samuel Mullet is accused of orchestrating the alleged attacks with members of his family .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:20 EST, 26 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:20 EST, 26 August 2012 . A 9/11 widow who was paid $1.4 million from the World Trade Center Victim Compensation Fund, is under fire from the son of her late husband, who claims his father’s marriage to the woman was a sham. Evgueni Kniazev, a Russian waiter at the Windows on the World restaurant atop the World Trade Center, actually paid American Irina Dubenskaya $5,000 to marry him so he could become a legal resident, his son Dennis Vinichenko told the New York Post. 'The relationship was temporary. There was no wedding. There was no wedding band. It was just paper,' the son said. Their actual wedding date wasn't provided but Dubenskaya moved into Kniazev's Brooklyn home in June 2001. Unjust: Dennis Vinichenko (pictured with his family) says his father only married his stepmother for a green card and says she shouldn't be entitled to 9/11 victim's compensation . When the man died on September 11, his new wife was the chief recipient of a government payout and the deceased man's children were left with little. 'My father was burned alive,' Vinichenko said. 'This woman was saying she was my family, and then she took all this money. She wasn't really his wife. She was just trying to cash in.' Kniazev, who came to the U.S. from Russia in 1992, was a waiter at Windows On The World, the 40,000 square foot restaurant on the 107th floor in the North tower at 1 World Trade Center. He was on duty when the first plane, American Airlines Flight 11, crashed into the building at 8.46am on September 11. The impact hit the structure between the 94th and 98th floors and within seconds, flames and smoke engulfed the complex, trapping those on the floors above. 90 minutes later the tower collapsed. The attacks on the World Trade Center claimed 2,606 lives, and as a result, the U.S. Congress established the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund to provide for families impacted by the attacks. Kenneth Feinberg was appointed to be special master of the fund, working 33 months to estimate how much each victim could have earned in their lifetimes. Windows on the World: The restaurant (photographed in the 1970s) was a tourist favorite for its breathtaking views of New York City. Evgueni Kniazev was working at the restaurant on September 11 . At the end of the process, $7 billion was awarded to 97 per cent of the families - with the average payout to individuals being $1.8 million. Irina Dubenskaya was awarded $1.4 million from the fund and according to a lawyer for her stepson, she did distribute money to both Vinichenko and his sister, who still lives in Russia, as part of a 2004 out-of-court settlement. Kenneth Feinberg, special master for the September 11 victim's compensation fund, was charged with allocating money for families of the victims . 'She would have technically been entitled to the whole thing, even though the marriage was a sham,' said Brian Schachter, who was Vinichenko's lawyer in the matter. 'At the time, I thought it was a decent deal.' The siblings received a total of $150,000, after legal fees, Vinichenko said. But the stepson now claims he was pressured into agreeing to the settlement by Dubenskaya, who allegedly threatened to turn him into immigration officials since he is a Russian citizen, living illegally in the U.S. Vinichenko and friends of the late Kniazev have criticized the widow for . using the money she received to pay for college for a son from a . previous marriage. 'I didn't like the way the money went,' a friend of the late husband, Alexander Teperev, said. 'Her son got to go . to college for free. It wasn't his son. I felt bad about that. The . money wasn't distributed properly.' Though he seems to have exhausted all his legal options now, Vinichenko wants to expose his stepmother as a fraud. ‘Money is really secondary,’ he . said. ‘But there’s real family that exists. What makes me mad is the . person that took the money is claiming she’s family.’ A friend who had known the couple . during their short union said that the groom entered into the marriage . on a '50/50' basis – half to help his legal status in the U.S. and half . because of his fondness for Irina. 'It was both,' Alexander Teperev said. 'It was business, and he liked her, too.' Irina herself even seemed to have doubts that love was the motivation for the marriage. Wedded bliss? Irina Dubenskaya moved into this Brooklyn home belonging to Evgueni Kniazev in June 2001, months before his death on September 11 . 'I can't tell if that was Eugene's original intention,' she told the Post, when asked if it was indeed just a green card marriage. 'I thought we had a nice marriage. We started living the American dream life. Then he died,' she added. Irina maintains that she is in the clear and blames her stepson for not moving on after the tragic loss. 'I have nothing to hide,' she said. 'Dennis got what he was entitled [to]. I respect Eugene. I love him. I just wish he didn’t have a son like that.'","Victim's son says his father, a Russian immigrant, paid an American woman $5,000 to marry him .

It is an audacious gamble that could determine who the next US president will be. In a last-ditch attempt to reconnect with the American people, Mitt Romney will parade his family on stage on the first day of the Republican presidential convention in Florida tomorrow – all 140 of them. The four-day convention is the biggest event of the former Massachusetts governor’s stuttering bid  to become the 45th president of  the USA. Chase begins: Mitt Romney (centre) addresses supporters while standing with sons (from left) Matt, Tagg, Craig, wife Ann, Ben and Josh Romney after winning the New Hampshire primary on 10 January 2012 . Four hundred and fifty days into Romney’s campaign, and with just ten weeks to go until the election, the Republican Party’s presumptive nomination is struggling to overcome the negative impact of his various gaffes, his apparently contradictory positions on several key issues including healthcare and abortion, and questions about his business career and wealth. Most polls have Barack Obama very slightly ahead, but in real terms the contest is neck and neck. The convention, which is likely to focus on economic issues and will be watched by a TV audience of more than 20 million people, will be the make-or-break moment for Romney because it will mark the point at which the majority of Americans will start to take notice of the presidential campaign. Conventions usually have a significant impact on a candidate’s prospects, and with six out of ten Americans saying they find it impossible to relate to his impassioned defence of traditional values, the former Mormon bishop is pinning his hopes on his family. He calculates that by portraying ‘Tribe Romney’ as a typically dysfunctional American family, he will win over voters. The family: Michigan Governor George Romney with his wife Lenore and children (left to right) Mitt Romney, G. Scott, Jane and Margo Lynn . Against the backdrop of a tasteful wood-panelled set – originally built for Oprah Winfrey – the 65-year-old billionaire will introduce relatives who range from his sister Jane (who was obliged by a failed marriage to take up an acting career) to a brother who was excommunicated for his sexual sins by the Mormon church. ‘The Romneys are believing Latter-day Saints but they are neither saints nor are they exempt from  the influences of the world around them,’ one of his cousins, Ronald Scott, observes in his new biography, Mitt Romney: An Inside Look At The Man And His Politics. Behind the good looks, Scott confides, the family’s attempts to adjust to ‘pressures and temptations’ make the confessions that will be aired on stage worthy of any reality show. Married to Ann, the blonde granddaughter of a Welsh coalminer, Mitt Romney has five sons and 18 grandchildren, which historians say may make him the most fecund White House candidate ever. Tagg Romney, 42, is Mitt’s oldest son. Like his father, he is an investment banker and so will help emphasise his father’s economic credentials. Tagg and his wife Jennifer have six children, and his four brothers also have families, but three of them ‘have wrestled with fertility issues,’ says Scott, and resorted to IVF treatment, seemingly inconsistent with their father’s moral views. Showing their support: Mitt's siblings Scott and Jane are set to appear at the convention . ‘They even employed a fairly compensated surrogate mother,’ claims Scott. He declined to identify which sons but notes that surrogacy is ‘strongly discouraged’ by the Mormon church, to which all the family belong. Matt Romney, 41, the second son, is a property developer. He and his wife Laurie have four children. The couple irked Mitt’s fellow Republicans last year when they attended a Halloween party dressed as Sarah Palin and her husband Tom. Josh Romney, 37, is considering a political career. The son and his wife Jenn have five children. After serving in England as a Mormon missionary, he became a male model in New York, but Scott says he became disenchanted by the ‘meat market decadence’. American audiences love a dramatic narrative. Ben Romney, 34, is a doctor. The son and his wife Ande have one child. Ben is said to be the most  ‘un-Romneylike’ of the brothers. Though he has agreed to appear with his family at the convention, he has no interest in politics. Craig Romney, 31, is the youngest son and a former advertising executive. He and wife Mary have two children, one of whom, Parker, is playing a major role in his grandfather’s attempt to soften his image. All to play for: Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney speaks as vice presidential running mate Rep. Paul Ryan listens during a campaign rally . He has repeatedly given interviews about how the four-year-old once fashioned his hair into a mohawk using egg whites and glue. ‘Man, that was one bad hair day,’ he says. Margo Lynn Keenan, 77, is Romney’s elder sister. She had eight children by her late husband, federal prosecutor Loren Keenan, and the convention will hear she has lived a self-effacing life, devoting herself to the care of her youngest son, who has Down’s syndrome. Lynn has grappled with other difficult issues. Mitt opposes abortion but she is expected to tell the audience he will not ‘force’ his beliefs on women because her sister-in-law  (Loren’s sister) died during a botched backstreet termination. JaneRomney, Mitt’s sister, is expected to reduce the house to tears with a deeply personal story. Now 74, the immaculately preserved bottle blonde dreamed of following her mother, Lenore, into a career as an actress. But she put aside her ambitions to start a family when, aged 20, she married a nephew of Gordon Hinckley, the head prophet of the Mormon church. After more than two decades of marriage, and four children, the couple had an acrimonious divorce.  ‘Family members told me Jane had a terrible divorce,’ said Scott. ‘It destroyed her life. Her husband had been a terrific philanderer.’ Aged 42, she decided to ‘resume’ her acting career, although roles have been few. In Florida she is expected to admit to another skeleton in the Romney family closet: she once campaigned for two of California’s best-known Democratic politicians. However, she now says she is a committed Republican. Tight: There's not much in it for the race to be President between Romney and the current premier Barack Obama . ‘I’ll be at the convention for six or seven days,’ she told The Mail on Sunday. ‘I have a big story to tell.’Scott Romney, Mitt’s 71-year-old brother, is expected to deliver a frank testimonial about ‘sin and redemption’, says a party insider. Scott shared his brother’s passion for politics, yearning to follow in the footsteps of their father, George, a millionaire car tycoon and governor of Michigan. But he failed to become Michigan’s chief law officer. He was ‘sealed for eternity’ in a Mormon temple ceremony to a TV presenter, Ronna Stern. After bringing up six children – five of their own and hers from a previous marriage – they divorced in 1992. Later, he was ‘disfellowshipped’ from the Mormon church when he married Ellen Rogers, a TV host who, in what Scott’s book calls a ‘religious transgression’, was pregnant with his child. He and Ellen divorced in 2009. In July last year, he married a widow, Sheri Lelalian. First wife, Ronna, now 68, will attend the convention, with Sheri and all seven of his children (including two by Ellen) and their seven grandchildren. It should all make for dramatic viewing. Will it prove to be car-crash TV, dashing Romney’s presidential ambitions? Or a masterstroke that sets his campaign alight?","Republican convention, starting tomorrow, is the defining moment of the campaign ."

First Wessex says it operates a 'zero tolerance' policy when it comes to obstacles that may prevent residents escaping in the event of a fire. The company says the family had been warned that the bike was a 'potential hazard' and not to store it in the communal area. Carol Williams, operations director at First Wessex, said all their residents are warned not to leave personal items in communal areas and regular inspections are carried out to make sure they are clear. An immediate removal notice was issued during a visit on August 8, followed by a first class letter warning the bike would be taken away, she said.

He was driving eight miles to Llanidloes to start work . at 2.30pm. He told his lawyer Geraint Jones that . he came up behind a VW Passat car and the people carrier ahead of it.

The biggest risers are in Kensington and Chelsea, where the average property costs a record £1.089million. In the past year, the price of a home in the London borough has jumped by an average of £150,000, or £12,600 every month, according to the Land Registry.

A 10-year-old girl, charged with killing a baby in July, almost caused the death of another, according to that girl's parents. Ashley Tenney and Chad Hopkins have named the 10-year-old as being responsible for their daughter's hospitalisation in June, brought on by sudden seizures. Doctors found the same medication in eight-month-old Jaylynn's system that is used by the accused girl to control her attention deficit hyperactivity disorder after they had been left alone together. Tenney and Hopkins were living with Amanda Huard, mother of the accused, in the basement of their home, the Maine Sunday Telegram reported. Shock: Ashley Tenney (left) has named the 10-year-old girl as being responsible for her daughter Jaylynn's (right) hospitalisation in June . They say the girl was alone with their daughter on June 19, while Hopkins was elsewhere in the house and Tenney was out at work. The couple trusted the girl, they said, that she had shown a 'healthy interest' in their daughter up until that point, offering to help with diaper changes and bathing. When Tenney arrived home from her shift at Dunkin' Donuts she found her daughter pale and sweating. 'She was soaked in sweat, just drenched,' said Tenney, 20. 'She was so pale. Whiter than a sheet of paper.' As they rushed her to the emergency room at MaineGeneral Medical Centre in Waterville, Jaylynn began convulsing and fitting. 'She was on her father's lap, and her head just dropped back, and she rapidly started shaking,' Tenney said. 'The first one lasted like 20 seconds.' The sudden seizures baffled doctors at first as they struggled to work out what had brought them on. Medical experts consulted one another and Jaylynn was transferred to Maine Medical Centre in Portland to be reassessed. Tragic: The 10-year-old girl has since been charged with manslaughter in connection with the death of 3-month-old Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway last month . 'If her head went to the left her arm went to the right and vice versa,' she said. 'Her heart rate was high and they were worried and didn't know what to do for her.' In Portland doctors probed Tenney about what medications were in Huard's house, matching up the 10-year-old's attention deficit hyperactivity disorder drugs with what they found in Jaylynn's system. So much was detected, Tenney said, that her daughter 'should have been dead'. She added that there 'wasn't any way' she could have ingested the medication on her own. In the days following the scare Tenney and Hopkins began looking for a new place to live, sickened by the belief that Huard's daughter had deliberately hurt their own. She said she had found a canvas bag in a drawer in the 10-year-old's bedroom, filled with more than 100 photographs of Jaylynn, some torn, others with words like 'my baby girl' written on them. The couple were interviewed by workers from the DHHS Office of Child and Family Services, as were with the 10-year-old and her mother. All four were told that the girl should not be given care of young children. Brooklyn's mother, Nicki, said traces of the 10-year-old's medication was found in her daughter's system . But despite the warnings the girl was once again left alone with a toddler just three weeks later, this time three-month-old Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway whose mother, Nicki, had left in Huard's care overnight. On July 9 Tenney said she was woken at 1.30am to the sound of crying, pounding footsteps and the word 'dead'. Brooklyn died during the course of that night, the ADHD drug present in her system. The 10-year-old has been charged with manslaughter in Brooklyn's death. Huard is not facing charges but the Department of Health and Human services said an agency review showed she had neglected the three-month-old child. 'Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway has died as a result of your neglect,' said the notice. 'You knew that (the 10-year-old) should not be babysitting children but have continued to allow her to do so.' Ms Greenaway has since said she blames Huard for her daughter's death. 'I feel a little bit of relief that they're charging her daughter at this point, but the mom really needs to be responsible,' Greenaway said. 'She's the one I left my daughter with.'","10-year-old charged in the death of three-month-old Brooklyn Foss-Greenaway on July 8, who was found to have traces of the girl's ADHD medication in her system .

This huge great white pelican at Moscow Zoo took exception to being photographed and lunged forward to peck Nikolay Sotskov's camera. Fortunately Nikolay was able to step back and prevent his lens disappearing into the vast abyss formed by the pelican's beak and the mouth opening - which is normally the last thing seen by fish, the bird's usual diet, as they are swallowed whole. Cross pelican: The huge great white pelican lunged for the photographer's camera at Moscow Zoo . The pelican lives at an area of Moscow Zoo called 'Swamp', accompanied by more pelicans and also cormorants. The great white pelican is know as the Rose pelican in Russia due to the rosy hue of its feathers . Nikolay said: 'It was really fun to make these shots as this pelican seemed to decide my camera was some kind of food suitable for pelicans and tried to peck it. 'It was even a bit scary because this is actually a big bird and weighs pretty much. 'But despite my fear I coped to make a couple of shots and I am satisfied with the result as these photos look funny.' The great white pelican is a huge bird, with only the Dalmatian pelican averaging larger amongst pelicans. The bird's wingspan can measure from 226 to 360 cm (7.41 to 11.8 ft), with the latter measurement the largest recorded among extant flying animals outside of great albatrosses. Its enormous bill comprises 28.9 to 47.1 cm (11.4 to 18.5 in) of that length. Adult males, weigh from 9 to 15 kg (20 to 33 lb), though large races from the Palaearctic are usually around 11 kg (24 lb) with few exceeding 13 kg (29 lb). Camera shy: The pelican took exception to being snapped by a photographer at Moscow Zoo in Russia . Open wide: The pelican demonstrated the full scale of its enormous beak for photographer Nikolay Sotskov . No pictures please: The great white pelican opened its beak as though to swallow the camera whole . Jaw-dropping: Photographer Nikolay Sotskov said he just managed to avoid losing his camera down the throat of the irate bird . The great white pelican is well adapted for aquatic life. The short strong legs and webbed feet propel it in water and aid the bird's rather awkward takeoff from the water surface. Once aloft, the long-winged pelicans are powerful fliers, and often travel in spectacular V-formation groups. Great white pelicans are usually found in and around shallow, warm, fresh water. In Africa, great white pelicans occur mainly around freshwater and alkaline lakes and may also be found in coastal, estuarine areas.","Great white pelican did not take kindly to being photographed at Moscow Zoo .

Eight police officers were rushed to hospital this morning after raiding a suspected drugs den and being knocked out - with a cocktail of petrol and heroin. The police burst into the house in Bordesley Green, Birmingham at around 12am this morning to uncover a £250,000 haul of drugs. But within seconds they were vomiting after being hit with the toxic vapour from suspected heroin mixed with petrol that was poured onto the carpet. Police said they were looking into whether the mixture was an attempt to use it as a 'weapon' when it was poured onto the carpet. A policeman stands outside the drugs den, right with windows open, in Birmingham where officers were left in vomiting fits after being gassed with a toxic heroin petrol cocktail . A forensic officer - careful to make sure they wear a mask - takes photographs as evidence as investigations into what the poisonous cocktail that hit police was . West Midlands Police said they attended the address with officers from the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), who executed a search warrant in relation to illegal drugs. They kicked in the door at around midnight and arrested three men, aged 21, 27 and 34 on suspicion of conspiracy to possess a controlled drug with intent to supply. Officers said they seized a 'very large quantity' of suspected Class A drugs with an approximate street value of around a quarter of a million pounds. While the arrests were being made, the officers were overpowerd by the unknown substance, which caused sickness and breathing difficulties. In total 11 people, consisting of eight police officers and the three who were arrested, were taken to Heartlands Hospital.

Parts of the area are still cordoned off and a number of road restrictions are in place while forensic examinations continue. A spokesman for West Midlands Police said it was not known why the petrol was poured onto the floor mixed with what was thought to be heroin. He said: 'We don't know if this was a mixture designed to be used as a weapon or if the heroin was being mixed with the petrol as part of the drug-makingprocess.' The Force’s Incident Manager, Chief Inspector Lee Wharmby, said: 'Police officers face threats on a daily basis and, on occasions, criminals will use extreme measures to resist arrest. 'What happened overnight demonstrates the ongoing commitment and bravery of officers as they work to keep our streets safe. 'Events such as this always raise concern in communities, but I want to be clear that this is about drugs alone and not connected to terrorism. 'A long term operation, ''No Deal'', is already underway targeting drug dealing across Birmingham, during which efforts have been focused on two organised crime groups responsible for the supply of cocaine and heroin in the local area.

A new alternative to going under the knife and the needle is set to go sale on the British high street this week. It contains extracts of the Chinese 'miracle herb' Gynostemma Pentaphyllum, which is dubbed 'magic grass' by people in Asia because of its anti-aging qualities. The Freeze 24/7 range, which has developed a cult following in the U.S. is to go on sale exclusively at Debenhams . Such is the hype surrounding the Freeze 24-7 range, it sold $200,000 on its first day in America, while hundreds of women have pre-ordered it here. Its Instant Target Wrinkle Treatment has been dubbed 'Botox in a jar' and has been scientifically proven to reduce lines and wrinkles in minutes. Debenhams will sell the entire range but a spokesman described the wrinkle treatment, which costs £40 for 10 ml, as the 'hero product'. The cream has been on sale in the UK . some years ago, but this is the first time the full range will be on . sale - and it is exclusive to the department store. Debenhams spokesman added Katie Holmes, Halle Berry, Penelope Cruz, Fergie and Marcia Cross were among the star fans of creams. Actresses Halle Berry, right, and Marcia Cross are said to be fans of the cream . The Instant Target Wrinkle Treatment has been tested independently by the AMA Laboratories which found consumers experienced as much as a 90 per cent reduction in wrinkles within ten minutes. The initial effects are temporary but the clinical trials also found that those using it for more than 28 days said they noticed their lines were softer – even after they stopped using the product. Freeze 24/7 counts Katie Holmes, Halle Berry and Penelope Cruz as fans . Cosmetics supervisor Michelle Dempsey, who first bought the product in America, said: ‘I have tried most of the age defying and anti-wrinkle creams ever produced, and I firmly believed that they are all of a ""muchness"" regardless of price. 'But I was astounded when I tried it and watched my deep wrinkles disappear, and with regular use they have softened altogether. 'They say the proof is in the pudding, and from I started using it, my friends and colleagues have asked me am I using a different foundation or have I had a facial treatment.’ The Instant Target Wrinkle Treatment combines the Gamma Aminobutryic Acid, which is a muscle relaxant found naturally in the body, with extracts of the herb Gynostemma Pentaphyllum. Used in Chinese medicine it is an anti-oxidant and  boosts circulation and the immune system. Combined in this cream, the GABA complex has a short term effect where muscles are relaxed on the face giving the appearance of smoother skin at the surface, while the Gynostemma Pentaphyllum has a longer term effect boosting skin cell renewal. The American website for the product has a number of before and after photographs to illustrate the products' effect . The treatment also has pomegranate and tangerine extracts, which are also anti-oxidants. It comes at a time when many people are turning their back on Botox and opting to try and find non- invasive alternatives. Kylie Minogue, Amanda Holden, and Joan Collins are among those who have tried the treatment but were put off by the pain or the effect it had on their faces. The market in the forehead freezing drug is worth almost £18 million in the UK alone. But recent research revealed that one of side-effects is that if you use it a lot, or have it injected by an inexperienced practitioner, Botox can actually give you wrinkles. Cosmetic experts have noted that knocking out some of the facial muscles can bring others into play, which could cause lines in places where it has not been injected. Louise Evison: 'Instant improvement' She says: The Targeted Instant Wrinkle Treatment has really improved my skin. The results are almost instant and I’ve noticed a reduction in furrow lines and wrinkles. My skin has a radiant glow. I don’t want fillers or any injections so this is a good alternative.

Convicted 'speed freak killer' Wesley Shermantine was briefly released from his cell on death row this week to lead police to the remains of numerous victims he murdered decades ago. Escorted out of California’s San Quentin State Prison, Shermantine led investigators to four wells in the town of Linden where they recovered numerous bones and other items. At his return last Sunday he typed up a letter, addressed to Bounty Hunger Leonard Padilla, sharing where they had gone. Scroll down for video . Digging: San Quentin State Prison deathrow inmate Wesley Shermantine led investigators to four wells, one pictured, where they recovered numerous bones and other items once belonging to his victims . Remains: Bones are seen at the site of one of the 45-feet-deep wells Shermantine led investigators to last Sunday . Mr Padilla released that letter to news station KTXL on Saturday. 'Leonard, I went out like I promised I would and showed them four wells,' Mr Padilla read. 'Three are close up, one is still open. At the trees I showed them where the well is,' he continued. In all San Joaquin County Investigators reported finding pieces of human skulls, other bones, clothing and jewellery, dropped inside the 45-feet deep wells. Serial killer: Wesley Shermantine, seen earlier in court, said this week that investigators missed finding what he called the boneyard, containing at least 12 victims he estimates . Deal: Shermantine's information comes from a pay deal made with a bounty hunter, prompting the inmate to send him a letter, pictured, recounting what they had done for his payment . 'They missed the actual boneyard, the one that has most of the bodies in it. I would say there are 12 bodies in that well,' Padilla read. The FBI reports having found four victims' bodies, including an unidentified woman and an unidentified foetus, since Shermantine began speaking out. Shermantine's willingness to speak is the result of a payment deal between him and Mr Padilla. Last year Mr Padilla gave Shermantine . $28,000 to talk to him about the murders, revealing information in an . effort to gain closure to the victims' families. 'I think it's very important that these . relatives, the mothers, the fathers, get whatever they can back,' Mr . Padilla told KTXL of his reasoning for his payments to Shermantine. Check writer: Bounty Hunger Leonard Padilla, seen reading the inmate's letter, says that paying the serial killer for the information is worth it to the victims and their families . Recovered: Since Shermantine began speaking out the FBI reports having found four victims' bodies, including an unidentified woman and an unidentified foetus. Their search efforts seen on Sunday . Recovery: San Joaquin County Investigators reported finding pieces of human skulls, other bones, clothing and jewellery, dropped inside the 45-feet deep wells . Earlier this year in a letter penned to California TV station CBS 13, Shermantine boasted of two burial sites he used with his accomplice Loren Herzog that had yet to be discovered. The letter, sent from Death Row, also contained a lengthy complaint about his media portrayal and about the behaviour of his sister. It ends, 'Have a nice day.' The bizarre letter was sent to the station's reporter Koula Gianulias at the end of a week when a search team found 1,000 bone fragments at a site previously named by Shermantine as the location of some of his and Herzog's victims. He said the reason he had not revealed . the other two sites was because at the time he hadn't been paid $33,000 . promised by Mr Padilla. Prior letter: Earlier this year Shermantine sent a bizarre message to a California television station telling them he knew where more of his victims' bodies were . Mr Padilla, who recognised Shermantine's handwriting in the letter, had said he was working to establish a trust account before paying. Shermantine began the letter by claiming that reports about him in the media were '90% lies', and repeating the assertion that Herzog, not Shermantine, was responsible for the deaths of up to 20 murder victims. He then complained that he had been taken to hospital following a warning from his sister Barbara Jackson that he could be suicidal - Shermantine said: 'Her concern is about 13 years too late.' The letter concluded: 'If you want to tell the truthful story you've got to offer me something. I've learned nothing's free any more in capitalism [sic] America,' with an invitation for Ms Gianulias to visit him in San Quentin prison. Grim work: San Joaquin Sheriff detectives Paul Hoskins, left, and Lindsay Smith sift for human remains that were excavated from an abandoned cattle ranch near Linden in February . Meticulous: Department of Justice personnel take a record of the human remains found in the well after Wesley Shermantine, motivated by a bounty hunter's promise to pay, lead investigators to burial sites . Wesley Shermantine (left)  and Loren Herzog were dubbed the 'Speed Freak Killers' after their 1999 arrest for a methamphetamine-fueled killing spree - Herzog hanged himself in January after finding out Shermantine was going to reveal the location of their burial sites . All week crews have been sifting through mounds of dirt after information was provided by Shermantine revealing the location of his long-lost victims. Investigators expanded the search after . authorities determined probably coming to the bottom of the first . well on the ranch about 12 miles outside of Stockton, San Joaquin . Sheriff's Department spokesman Les Garcia said. Officials said about 1,000 bone fragments were found buried on Calaveras County property once owned by Shermantine's family. Mr Garcia could not provide any new numbers on how many bones or possible victims have been found at the time. The first well, which was filled in by the owner in the mid to late 1980s, was being cleared so that a camera could be lowered into it. Cadaver dogs from Santa Clara County were brought in to detect if there are human remains left in the dirt cleared out, Mr Garcia said. Close detail: Crews spent days searching the ranch in Linden, at what San Joaquin Sheriff's Department spokesman said was a 'slow and tedious' pace . Victims: The bodies of Cyndi Vanderheiden, left and Chevelle Wheeler, right, were found buried in California in the area identified by Shermantine in February . Missing: Michaela Garecht, nine, has still not been found since her abduction in November 1988 . The search has already had a significant amount of success, as the bodies of two murder victims were found during those searches in February. The . remains of two women- Chevelle 'Chevy' Wheeler disappeared while . skipping school in 1985 aged 16, and Cyndi Vanderheiden, a 25-year-old . last seen in front of her Linden home in 1998- were found during the . search, giving their families some closure. Dental records identified remains found Thursday in Calaveras County as those of 25-year-old Ms Vanderheiden, who disappeared. Another set of remains were found . in the same area, and the parents of the missing 16-year-old girl have . said authorities told them that Shermantine said their daughter was . buried in that spot decades ago. The bones and skulls that were discovered along with clothes, a purse . and jewellery leads authorities to believe that there may be 10 or more . victims. Meanwhile, 65 calls have been made to a . hotline set up by authorities for people who believe their loved ones . might be among the victims of Shermantine and Herzog. Earlier this year, Shermantine wrote to a local . paper saying that Herzog was behind the abduction of Michaela Garecht, a 9-year-old was was snatched from the street in 1988. He said that he . would lead police to the spot where the pair used to bury their victims, . but she is still missing. Shermantine is on death row after he was convicted in 2001 of four murders. Investigators said the boyhood friends were suspected in as many as 20 murders as a result of a meth-fueled crime spree. Herzog was convicted of three murders . and sentenced to 77 years to life in prison. Herzog's sentence was . reduced to 14 years after an appeals court tossed out his first-degree . murder convictions because his confession had been illegally obtained. Herzog was paroled in 2010 to a trailer outside the High Desert State . Prison in Susanville. He killed himself in January outside that trailer after learning Shermantine was disclosing the victims' locations.

A spokesman for Fortune told the Atlantic Wire that the magazine used a photo it took of Ms Mayer a year earlier because she declined to be photographed for the new issue, writing, 'We did put in a request for Marissa to pose for the cover and she declined.'

"Founders Kari Sigerson and Miranda Morrison must watch from the sidelines as the brand shows at New York Shoe Expo this week . The women were fired by their once-trusted financial backer Marc Fisher . By . Kristie Lau . PUBLISHED: . 12:39 EST, 2 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:44 EST, 2 August 2012 . Kari Sigerson and Miranda Morrison were once the toast of the fashion industry. But the two New York designers who launched Sigerson Morrison, the shoe line, in 1991, have been fired from their namesake brand and are currently being sued for almost $2million by their own financial backer. Despite their departure, their once-trusted business partner Marc Fisher, who has his own namesake shoe line, continues to churn out collections of footwear under the two women's names. New frontier: Designers Kari Sigerson (left) and Miranda Morrison (right) were ousted from their shoe line Sigerson Morrison. They are now being sued by their financial backer for failing to deliver a final shoe collection . The two women, who were fired from their own label just over a year ago, are being sued in New York State Court for allegedly failing to deliver a collection of shoes on time. Ms Sigerson, who met Ms Morrison in 1987 when the pair were studying at the Fashion Institute Of Technology, told The New York Times: 'It's like 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers'... I went into Barneys, and I didn't even recognize them [the shoes].' The new-look brand is showing at New York's Shoe Expo this week under the direction of Mr Fisher. The two designers were terminated after tension between the women and Mr Fisher, who is the son of Nine West founder Jerome Fisher, allegedly reached boiling point. New look: The shoes continue to be manufactured under the direction of Marc Fisher's in-house design team . Old look: The designer's own designs, including the two above, were highly coveted by the Hollywood A-list . The pair had not only suspected that Mr . Fisher was copying their designs and creating them as part of his own . budget line, but they were also allegedly infuriated over his decision . to uproot their line's manufacturing out of Italy and into China. Of course, the shoes were undoubtedly among the most in-demand on the market when the women had their way. A pair of Sigerson Morrison white ankle boots were worn by Sarah Jessica Parker in 2008's first Sex And The City film. Actresses Charlize Theron, Reese Witherspoon, Hillary Duff and Rachel Bilson were also spotted in various designs over the years. Ms Morrison said that Julia Roberts had visited her store and that Ms Theron 'would buy 20 pairs at a time with her mom'. Celebrity fans: The line was so popular when the women were designing for it that a pair of white ankle boots were worn by Sarah Jessica Parker in 2008's Sex And The City film (left). Charlize Theron (right) was also a fan . Foolishly, the women signed away their intellectual-property rights to their own names when Mr Fisher paid $2.6million in 2006 for the company. Although it was legally renamed Fisher Sigerson Morrison at the time, the label stayed the same and the two women each retained a ten per cent stake in the company. They were named co-heads of design and given an annual salary of $350,000 each. On March 10, 2011, the designers were given letters of termination as their email accounts were cut off. But as Mr Fisher seeks damages of almost $2million, the designers are fighting their own legal battle against the businessman. The . two women have filed a countersuit, seeking $6million in damages and . have alleged that Mr Fisher had sexually harassed them on numerous . occasions, thus creating a hostile workplace. Moving on: The line is being showed at this week's New York Shoe Expo. Resort 2013 designs are seen above . Court papers state that Mr Fisher once stared down the back of Ms Sigerson's clothes 'so lewdly' that Susan Itzkowitz, the president of the company, said out loud that he required sexual harassment training. The designers added that the delay in the shoe collection was caused by a problem with factory samples, was not their fault and that Mr Fisher had agreed to hold the collection. Mr Fisher has been accused of knocking off designs in the past. In May, Gucci won a case that accused Marc Fisher Footwear of copying its signature G logo for designs within the Guess stable. Marc Fisher Footwear has been ordered to pay $456,183 in damages. Last December, Ivanka Trump Footwear, which is also produced by Mr Fisher, was accused of copying Derek Lam's platform sandal. Mr Fisher denied the claim.","Founders Kari Sigerson and Miranda Morrison must watch from the sidelines as the brand shows at New York Shoe Expo this week .

Zoe Hammonds was dumped two years ago when she struggled to fit into a size 22 . dress - but after eighteen months of failing to find herself a new man . has now got in shape. The 34-year-old from Leicester shed an impressive six stone and with the new-found confidence, has now gone on her first date in two years. Zoe Hammonds has gone from size 22 to size 10 in just six months after getting dumped by her boyfriend . Zoe Hammonds was dumped two years ago and after eighteen months of failing to land a man - she decided to get in shape . And to add to her first step back onto the love scene, since her incredible weightloss, a man she used to be in love with is now begging to date her. The British Gas sales manager, who kept a photo diary and journal marking her amazing progress each month, has impressed friends and colleagues after ditching her former diet of cheesecake, pizzas, profiteroles and chocolate. She said: 'My boyfriend broke up with me two years ago. I wasn’t feeling good and I’ve been single since then. 'It was pretty frustrating but dating has significantly increased since I lost the weight. Now I’m going on my first date for two years. Zoe is now filled with confidence and excited to be dating again . 'A man who I was in love with has come back and said he is now interested in me. 'Lots of other people I used to like have come back to me and asked me out as well but I tell them all the same thing - you snooze, you lose. 'You could have had this amazing, witty, thin girlfriend with a great personality. But it’s too late, you had your chance. 'When I got to size 16, loads of lads at work started complementing me. 'At size 12 - the offers of dates started coming in and random people started asking me out on facebook. 'Due to being overweight for so long, I am actually quite shy and not used to people complimenting me on how I look but I am now slowly beginning to enjoy it. Zoe has now started to become a little braver and is taking a few of these suitors up on their offers, and she is on the look out for Mr Charming. 'It is fair to say I have been pretty unlucky in love to date so I’m excited to see if the increase in volumes also brings with it an increase in calibre. 'I am excited about dating now because I also think I will pick better, as when I look back now I think I have always felt like I am not good enough in relationships and this has meant that I have not always spoken up when I have been unhappy about something possibly because I am scared they will leave. 'When you’re fat you’re invisible. Even now I still feel fat in my mind because I lost the weight so quickly. A man who she was once in love with has even come running back . 'The extra attention I’m now getting was scary as hell. I’m not used to people commenting on my body. Another reason for her changing her attitude towards her weight was when her father fell ill with a kidney infection. Added to that, one of her best friends was diagnosed and battling with terminal cancer, which changed her outlook on life. 'It gave me the wake up call I needed to recognise that even though I have always given the impression of being confident and happy being overweight and feeling unattractive has been holding me back for years. Zoe's friends can't believe the difference, Zoe lost weight by slimming on just 500 calories a day . 'People always tell you that in your 30s all you spend your time doing is going to births, deaths and weddings and that has definitely been true, but having been single for two years now I have found myself playing the Hugh Grant character in Four Weddings & A Funeral going to these events alone. 'Watching friends getting married and having children has only reminded me that I have always wanted those things and at the age of 34 and spending lots of time focusing on my career I seem no closer to achieving them. 'For the first time ever I now love shopping, as I do not have to go to fat shops, and can buy things off the rack and know that it will fit. In just six months Zoe dropped an incredible 12 dress sizes and six stone in weight . 'When you are overweight shopping in special shops is not good for your confidence and the choice is limited,' she said, . Since she started the Lighter Life diet programme, Zoe eats about a fifth of what she used to eat and only eats their specific food packs which equate to 500 calories a day. Since she has ditched her original diet of chocolate, cheese and pizza, she feels much healthier and happy and visits the gym three times a week.

The pictures that we see from space are likely to improve in quality in the future after one astronaut  invented a specialised camera that solved the problem of taking pictures on board the craft which moves at more than four miles a second. Andre Kuipers recently installed 'Nightpod' - a motorised camera that compensates for the hurtling speeds of the ISS, by tracking points on Earth's surface. The results are some of the most spectacular pictures ever taken from space. Astronauts aboard the International Space Station are regularly treated to a spectacular view of cities on Earth lit up at night - but the relative speed of the space station meant any pictures taken at night were blurred. In late 2002 and early 2003, however, astronaut Don Pettit, part of Expedition 6, constructed a device called a barn-door tracker using spare parts from around the space station. Just as they like taking pictures looking down on us from above, photographing the ISS has become a popular pastime. Last year French astrophotographer Thierry Legault went to Oman to photograph the sun, moon and space station lined up. Legault, who received the Marius Jacquemetton award from the Société astronomique de France in 1999, use websites that predicted when the ISS will pass in front of the Sun or Moon and what location those passes will be visible from. Smart phone apps and certain websites use longitude and latitude data to show space enthusiasts when the ISS will be visible - if the weather conditions are agreeable. The station can been seen across the entire world except from in the extreme north and south. Over African skies: Storms throw vivid displays as the space station floats above the continent .

Resilient: Humble water carrier Spyros Louis became a Greek national hero when he won the first modern Olympic marathon in 1896... with a little help from some brandy half-way round . Nowadays, he may have opted for Red Bull or Lucozade. But back it 1896, the energy-boosting drug of choice that helped a humble water carrier become a national hero came in a rather different form. While many of his competitors collapsed from exhaustion, Spyros Louis triumphed in the first modern Olympic marathon by sipping brandy half-way round to keep him ahead of the field. The farmer's son completed the 26-mile race in under three hours - eight minutes ahead of second place. His remarkable story has come to the world's attention once again after the cup he was awarded sold for a record £541,000 at auction this week. A Greek charity defied the economic crisis to ensure the trophy would remain in the nation after it was sold by his grandson, also called Spyros Louis. The sale sent Greek heritage . organisations into a frenzy as they desperately sought the money to . prevent the historic relic from leaving the country. And . despite being gripped by economic hardship, Greek philanthropic . organisation The Stavros Niarchos Foundation found the funds to outbid . several international parties. The £541,250 paid for the trophy was well over the £160,000 estimate and set a world record for a piece of Olympic memorabilia. The 'Breal Cup' will now be returned to Greece where it will eventually go on public display. Nicolette Tomkinson, of London . auctioneers Christie's, said: 'We are delighted that the importance of . the Breal Cup was recognised by collectors around the world and that it . will return to be on public display in Greece. 'It is hard to believe that such a small trophy represents so much in sporting and Olympic history. 'A total of six bidders competed for it. The cup was sold for £541,250 to The Stavros Niarchos Foundation via telephone.' A delighted Mr Louis watched the bidding war unfold over the internet. He . said: 'I could never have imagined the auction of my grandfather's . marathon winner's cup would generate such international interest and . raise such significant funds to secure the future of my family.' Symbol of Greek heritage: This cup, awarded to Spyros Louis, fetched a world-record price when a Greek charity paid £541,000 to keep it in the country . Sought after: A bidding war between six organisations pushed the price way beyond the estimated £160,000 when it went under the hammer at Christie's in London . He added: 'I am overwhelmed by the global admiration felt for my grandfather and his Olympic victory for Greece in 1896. 'I am delighted that the cup will soon be on permanent public display for the whole of Greece and the world to see.

A dying schoolgirl desperately seeking a bone marrow transplant to save her from a rare deadly illness is being kept alive - with horse blood. Zoe Gilbert, 11, has a form of aplastic anaemia which doctors believe can only be a cured by a transplant. The condition, also called bone marrow failure, affects the blood and is caused by the bone marrow and stem cells not producing enough blood cells. So far, Zoe’s desperate family have failed to find a match for the youngster. Zoe Gilbert, 11, is dying from rare aplastic anaemia, which attacks her immune system. Doctors are keeping her alive with medicine made from horse anitbodies. Pictured with her mother Elizabeth and sister Kirstie . Instead, the schoolgirl is having her dangerously weak immune system boosted - by horse blood. A serum from the equine blood is injected into Zoe because it contains antithymocyte globulin (ATG) - an antibody which doctors hope will kick-start her immune system. Incredibly, the treatment has a range of bizarre side effects, including the growth of facial hair. There is also a risk Zoe could contract a deadly infection - but medics believe her illness is so bad the chance is worth taking. Zoe will have to wait for four weeks after the treatment is completed to find out whether it has been successful. If it doesn’t work, her only option will be finding a suitable bone marrow donor to come forward and save her life. Zoe’s mother Elizabeth Gilbert today launched an urgent appeal for more donors to sign up to the bone marrow register to ‘secure Zoe’s life’. She said: ‘It’s very difficult at the moment not knowing what will happen. My biggest fear is it not working and having to go through it again. ‘A transplant would secure Zoe’s life. Even if we don’t find a match,donors could save other people’s lives.' Zoe's sister, Kirstie Gilbert, 24, added: 'We are just desperate for her to be well again. Zoe wants to go to sleepover parties and not worry about getting sick. She has just started secondary school and is only able to do three days a week. The nursery school teacher, added: 'There are so many risks with this treatment and her body could reject it or relapse from it at any time. Doctors hope the antibodies will kick-start Zoe's immune system. If not, her only option will be finding a suitable bone marrow donor to save her life . 'She's my little sister - I take her to have her nails done and treat her to shoes to try and cheer her up. 'But there are only so many pairs of shoes you can buy - she just wants her life back.' Every year, thousands of patients with blood cancer and other blood disorders are given transplants of healthy bone marrow. Their own diseased marrow is first destroyed to prevent the new marrow from being rejected and to create space for the transplanted tissue. Zoe, who lives with her family in Impington, Cambridgeshire, was diagnosed with the condition by doctors at Addenbrooke’s Hospital after she had ten nose bleeds in just two weeks. The condition means her bone marrow fails to reproduce red and white blood cells and platelets, which prevent bruising, and leaves Zoe with little resistance to infections. Zoe, a student who loves football and swimming, has to have blood and platelet transfusions every week - spending days at a time in hospital. Staff at Addenbrooke’s hospital and the Anthony Nolan charity, which manages the UK bone marrow register, have searched world-wide but failed to find a suitable donor for Zoe. Research shows that family members are not necessarily compatible and it is more likely that a complete stranger will be an exact match. Children who do not have a brother or sister who is a good bone marrow match can be treated with a immunosuppressive therapy using antibodies from horse and rabbit blood. The horse therapy reduces the number of white blood cells circulating in the bloodstream using drugs such as antilymphocyte globulin (ATG) and ciclosporin, which stimulate the bone marrow to restart blood cell production. Myles Bradbury, consultant paediatric haematologist at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, said; 'For children who do not having a sibling bone marrow match the second option is an unrelated match. 'If, as in this case, we cannot find a match we use horse ATG, which has an 85 per cent survival rate.' The antibodies are given to the patient in a liquid medicine intravenously through a central line in the neck. Unfortunately, the main side effect of ciclosporin is extra hair growth on the body, which can be quite obvious on the face. Patients can also suffer from high temperatures, rashes and swollen, painful joints. Zoe has to be kept in hospital for three weeks and closely monitored in isolation as she will be prone to fatal infection while undergoing the treatment. Dr Michael Gattens, consultant paediatric haematologist at Addenbrooke’s Hospital, Cambridge, said: ‘Ideally bone marrow is the best option but without a match we use ATG. ‘It is a pretty intensive treatment and can result in serum sickness, but we can only carry out marrow transplants if we have a perfect match - it is essential for this condition, otherwise it won’t work. ‘Zoe will be in hospital for three weeks and she will be kept in isolation and closely monitored for infection which in many cases can be fatal.’ He added: ‘For most people, a transplant is a long-term solution. Occasionally, many years down the line, people relapse.’ Aplastic anaemia affects only one in every 200,000 people and in many cases the reasons behind the condition are not clear. Experts estimate only about 30 to 40 children are diagnosed with aplastic anaemia each year.It can affect anyone at any age but seems to occur most often in children and people over 60 years old.

"PUBLISHED: . 19:23 EST, 26 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:51 EST, 27 May 2012 . When Priscilla Chan married her long-time boyfriend, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, last weekend she looked every inch the fairytale bride. In a stunning full-length white gown, 27-year-old Priscilla smiled serenely as she exchanged vows with Zuckerberg, 28, worth an astonishing £12 billion, in a surprise ceremony. Her transformation into the wife of the world's youngest billionaire, however, is more remarkable than it may seem. For Priscilla is the child of a Chinese-Vietnamese father who arrived in America with his family in the Seventies after spending time in a refugee camp. Billionaire bride: Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg wed Priscilla Chan last weekend in California . Later Dennis Chan, 47, raised enough money to open a Chinese restaurant, where he worked gruelling 18-hour days as he dreamt of his first-born daughter living the American dream. Priscilla was raised largely by her grandmother as her mother Yvonne also worked long hours at the Taste of Asia in Boston. At the 1,200-pupil state-run Quincy High School in the working-class town of Quincy, near Boston, it quickly became clear that Priscilla was bright - and determined to get on. Peter Swanson, 66, her science teacher and tennis coach, said: 'She came up to me during that first year, when she was 13, and said, 'What do I have to do to get into Harvard University?'' 'I was stunned. In all my years of teaching I have never had a 13-year-old ask a question like that. She knew what she wanted, even back then. I encouraged her to join the tennis team because I knew that Harvard would require her to have a well-rounded resumé.' He added: 'She was mostly raised by her Chinese grandmother, who spoke no English. She was a very dignified woman who clearly was a huge influence in Priscilla's life. The grandmother was her emotional support. Her parents were working long hours - 18-hour days - at the restaurant. 'Priscilla worked incredibly hard at her studies and graduated top of her class. She gave me a voucher for a free meal at her family's restaurant as a gift. 'It was clear the family came from humble beginnings but were prepared to work around the clock to make something of their new life in America. 'Priscilla had that drive within her. She did everything she needed to round out her resumé and make it attractive to Harvard. And she joined the tennis club – she was not a natural athlete but with hard practice she steadily improved. When she got into Harvard she ran up to me grinning from ear to ear and said, 'See, I told you I would get to Harvard!'' Changing fortunes: The Chans' old restaurant Taste of Asia in Boston - now called Pho & I . Mr Swanson visited Priscilla and her new husband at their £3.5 million home in Palo Alto, California, last year. 'Mark was at the kitchen table working on his computer,' he said. 'Priscilla introduced us and he grinned and said, 'Behind every great man there is a great woman.'' 'People are saying how lucky she is to marry him, but he knows he's the lucky one. Priscilla is the ultimate story of the American dream made good. Her parents came to the States with virtually nothing and she has married a self-made billionaire. It doesn't get much better than that.' Priscilla has closely guarded her family's humble roots, releasing only a few titbits through Facebook's PR machine. Her 'official' biography states that after Quincy High, she studied biology at Harvard where she met Zuckerberg as they queued for the toilet at a party in 2003. She has recalled: 'He was this nerdy guy who was just a little bit out there.' While Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard after founding Facebook in his dorm room and moved to California to build his company, she remained at the prestigious Ivy League university. After Harvard, Priscilla attended medical school and graduated as a pediatrician a week before her wedding. Her family's home is a four-bedroom red-brick detached house in a quiet cul-de-sac in the middle-class Boston suburb of Braintree. But the precise details of how the family arrived in America are unclear. Determined pupil: Priscilla's yearbook photo from state-run Quincy High School, near Boston . Reports in China say they came originally from the city of Xuzhou in eastern Chandong province, also the home city of Rupert Murdoch's wife Wendi Deng. Others say that the family lived in Nanjing, an industrial town 150 miles west of Shanghai, before leaving to live first in Hong Kong and later in the US. A source at the Asian-American Civic Association in Boston said it was 'highly likely' the family spent time in a refugee camp, either in Hong Kong or on arrival in the US. Priscilla's father said he was a refugee who had lived in Vietnam, according to Thai-born Napat . Sriwannavit, who bought the 87-seat Taste of Asia restaurant from him in 2006 and turned it into a noodle bar called Pho & I. Mr Sriwannavit said: 'Mr Chan was a very good man, very good manners. He said he had been a refugee and had lived in Vietnam. He was Chinese but he told me he lived in Vietnam.' When Priscilla's father sold up, he told the new owner: 'I'm tired of working such long hours.' Records show Dennis, who now owns a small wholesale fish business, was given a social security number as an 'Asian Refugee' between April 1975 and November 1979. It is believed that he and his accountant wife, now 50, moved to Massachusetts in the early Eighties. Priscilla and her younger sisters, Elaine and Michelle, were born in the US. Priscilla has already introduced Zuckerberg to her Asian roots. The couple travelled to Vietnam last December and to China in March. Of the future, Mr Swanson said: 'Priscilla wants to contribute to society. She was the one who encouraged Mark to start a feature on Facebook encouraging people to be organ donors. 'She knows who she is and what she wants. She and Mark both want to change the world. And they are in the fortunate position of having the resources to do that.'

Researchers found increasing the number of cups of caffeinated coffee you drink could lower your risk of developing the most common form of skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma. Doctor Jiali Han, associate professor at Brigham and Women's Hospital in the United States, said: 'Our data indicate that the more caffeinated coffee you consume, the lower your risk of developing basal cell carcinoma. Study suggests caffeine in coffee decreases risk of basal cell carcinoma . 'I would not recommend increasing your coffee intake based on these data alone. 'However, our results add basal cell carcinoma to a list of conditions for which risk is decreased with increasing coffee consumption. This list includes conditions with serious negative health consequences such as type 2 diabetes and Parkinson's disease.' Even though basal cell carcinoma is slow-growing, it causes considerable illness and places a burden on health care systems. There are an estimated 80,000 new cases in the UK every year. Dr Han said: 'Given the large number of newly diagnosed cases, daily dietary changes having any protective effect may have an impact on public health.' Dr Han and his colleagues analysed data from the Nurses' Health Study, a large and long-running study to aid in the investigation of factors influencing women's health, and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, a study of men. Of the 112,897 participants included in the analyses, 22,786 developed basal cell carcinoma during the more than 20 years of the two studies. An inverse association was observed between all coffee consumption and risk of basal cell carcinoma. Similarly, an inverse association was seen between intake of caffeine from all dietary sources - coffee, tea, cola and chocolate - and risk of basal cell carcinoma. However, consumption of decaffeinated coffee was not associated with a decreased risk of basal cell carcinoma. Dr Han said: 'These results really suggest that it is the caffeine in coffee that is responsible for the decreased risk of basal cell carcinoma associated with increasing coffee consumption. 'This would be consistent with published mouse data, which indicate caffeine can block skin tumour formation. 'However, more studies in different population cohorts and additional mechanistic studies will be needed before we can say this definitively.' In contrast to the findings for basal cell carcinoma, neither coffee consumption nor caffeine intake were inversely associated with the two other forms of skin cancer, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma, the most deadly form of the disease. Only 1,953 cases of squamous cell carcinoma and 741 cases of melanoma were recorded among the 112,897 participants included in Han's analyses. Dr Han added: 'It is possible that these numbers are insufficient for any association with coffee consumption to be seen. 'As the study participants are followed for a longer time, the number of cases of these conditions is likely to increase. We may be in a position in 10 years' time to better address this issue.' The findings were published in the journal Cancer Research.","There are an estimated 80,000 new cases of basal cell carcinoma in UK every year .

A young woman who was left with a permanent brain injury while working as an extra on the movie Transformers 3 received an $18.5 million settlement today. Gabriella Cedillo, then 24, was airlifted to hospital after being hit in the head as she drove a car during a stunt in September 2010. A cable under tension snapped and smashed through the windshield of the Toyota driven by Miss Cedillo on location in Hammond, Indiana. Catastrophic: Gabriella Cedillo, pictured in hospital, has received $18.5million after suffering a brain injury . Smash: A cable swung through Cedillo's windshield on the set of Transformers 3 in 2010 in Indiana . The young woman was taken by helicopter to a nearby hospital and underwent emergency surgery for serious head injuries. The 26-year-old suffered irreversible damage following the incident. Her attorneys said a 'completely inadequate superficial weld had been applied in a failed effort to secure the bracket to the [stunt] car' according to NBC. Irreversible: Gabriella Cedillo, 26, was left with a permanent brain injury following the incident on the movie set . Miss Cedillo's lawyers added that Paramount Pictures and DreamWork’s Studios did everything they could avoid paying their employee's medical bills and had brought several lawsuit to avoid paying the young woman compensation, according to NBC. A Cook County judge approved the multi-million dollar settlement today. At the time of the accident in 2010, a witness said: 'The cable snapped, and the cable went into the westbound lane where we were at and hit the girl’s car, smashed the windshield. 'From the way it looked, I don’t know if she was knocked out immediately or not but the... vehicle just went, it just kept going.' Ms Cedillo was not a stuntwoman but simply an extra in the blockbuster film. On that particularly fateful day of shooting, she was one of the extras who opted to driver her own car, a 2006 Toyota sedan, during a freeway scene. 'We weren't trained stunt people,' an on-set source told RadarOnline. 'They paid regular extras to use their own personal cars an extra $25 per day for that freeway scene. 'We were never informed of the risk we were putting ourselves in and when you take into consideration the amount you are being paid to be there, it's not worth it.' Horrific: The end of the cable which smashed at high-sopeed through the woman's windscreen. The movie studios were said to have been reticent to pay for the young woman's medical bills . Ms Cedillo's brother told the local NBC affiliate that his sister worked as a bank teller at the time of the incident, but she took on extra roles in an effort to break into the film industry. 'This was not her first time as an extra,' her brother Adam said, without expanding into what other films his sister had appeared in. 'She always wanted to be in movies.' On the set, director Michael Bay was said to have given the crew a lecture on the importance of safety shortly before the incident, but considering the on-set source's comments, that lecture must not have extended to the extras. The accident happened on the penultimate day, with the set closed and filming postponed as a result. A-list treatment: Transformers 3 starred model Rosie Huntington-Whitely (pictured) along with Shia LaBeouf, Patrick Dempsey, Frances McDormand and John Malkovich . Shocking footage of the crash itself was obtained by RadarOnline. It shows that a large tractor-type car was hooked up to a white sedan on the opposite side of the freeway median. For whatever reason, the cable snapped and whipped over to the right side, then hitting Ms Cedillo's car as she drove in the opposite direction. The family's lawyer told the site: 'She appears to be quite impaired with her ability to understand and appreciate everything. 'I'm not saying she's not coping...and considering where people thought she would be, she's fortunate. 'But she has the function of a small child right now.'

Victoria Osoteku, 19, the only girl in the gang, will be sentenced next week after being found guilty of manslaughter. The murder in March 2010 was sparked by 'simmering tensions' between pupils at the sixth-form college in Ladbroke Grove and Henry Compton school in Fulham, who each regarded Victoria station as 'home territory'. Mark Heywood QC, prosecuting, said: 'Sofyen Belamouadden was pushed down and killed in broad daylight. Attack: Victoria Osoteku, left, was seen on CCTV kicking Sofyen Belamouadden, right, in the head as he lay dying on the ground. She will be sentenced next week . 'So brazen and confident were his killers, they openly carried the . various weapons they used with them as they ran towards him and hunted . him down.' The catalyst for the attack was a fight over a girl a day earlier in the station, which left one youth with a bloody nose. That night the Ladbroke Grove pupils plotted their revenge on Facebook, with Oderinwale, then 16, acting as an 'armourer'. Accomplices (from left to right): Adonis Akra, 18, Samuel Roberts, 19, and . Femi Oderinwale, 18, were found guilty of manslaughter and given 12 . years detention each . Jailed: Tyrone Richards, 17, (left) and Enoch Amoah, 19 (right) were found guilty of conspiracy to commit GBH and were sentenced to seven years detention . He asked online contacts for a 'flick-up ting' and told an older friend . to 'buy some nanks from Argos', referring to a box of kitchen knives. He told his friends there was a 'beef' with other youths in west London and someone could get 'slumped' (stabbed). Horrific: Judge Christopher Moss told the court today that the 'ferocious and merciless attack' took place in front of horrified commuters at Victoria station . Proud: Abdeslam Belamouadden, the father of Sofyen, said his son 'was a star in the making' Other defendants, who also communicated by texts, talked about the . 'madness' that was going to take place. When the two groups met the next . day at Victoria, the pupils from Henry Compton were hopelessly . outnumbered. Odegbune, then 16, led the running charge with the Samurai sword, . shouting: 'I'm going to **** you up' as he ran into the station. Roberts, 17, booted the victim's head three times as if he 'were kicking a rugby football'. Following the attack, 12 of the 20 youths boarded a bus and one was . overheard saying: 'Didn't you see me run in to the station and shank . him?' Police officers stopped the bus and found a selection of knives as . well as blade-sharpening steels which were covered in the victim's . blood. In a statement read to the court, Naima Ghailan, the murdered boy's . mother, said: 'No amount of words can describe the amount of pain and . grief I live with day in, day out. 'I had a happy life with my four children at home – then, on March 25, . 2010, my life was shattered into a million pieces as I was robbed of my . son.

Heading for divorce: Multi-millionaire Ben Goldsmith with his wife Kate, whom he has branded 'appalling' over her relationship with a rapper . Ben Goldsmith was arrested . at the couple’s £20million home in Kensington, West London, last week . on suspicion of actual bodily harm but released without charge after he . accepted a caution. The Eton-educated financier is now expected to issue divorce proceedings against his 29-year-old wife on the grounds of her alleged adultery. Since tweeting about his upset he has been inundated with messages from supporters. Claire Willows, one of Mr Goldsmith’s 6,000 followers on Twitter, sent one saying: ‘Can’t believe she called the police on you. You deserve sooooo much better than that.’ He replied: ‘Agree, appalling.’ Clare Magee, of Strabane, Northern Ireland, wrote: ‘Your wife is a fool, your [sic] gorgeous looking, even without the money.’ Mr Goldsmith, youngest son of the late billionaire Sir James Goldsmith, replied: ‘Very kind of you!’ Backing from women: Mr Goldsmith has been deluged with messages of support on Twitter since it was revealed he had split from wife Kate . Earlier, he hit out at reports that his estranged wife had taken on a public relations firm to advise her and accused her of caring more about her reputation than their three children, a daughter aged eight and sons aged seven and four. He wrote: ‘@kateroundtable [his wife’s Twitter account] has hired Project Associates Ltd to fix her  reputation (bit late surely?). How about focusing on her devastated children?’ Mrs Goldsmith, a member of the Rothschild banking dynasty, hit back in a statement saying their children were her ‘main concern’. A spokesman said she believed ‘false and inaccurate information’ had been given to the media and questioned if it was an attempt to ‘deflect from the gravity of last week’s incident involving the police’. He said she was ‘devastated’ and was seeking legal advice ‘on a number of matters’. Meanwhile Jay Electronica, 35, whose real name is Timothy Elpadaro Thedford, has returned to London from his grandmother’s funeral in the US and tweeted ‘#LoveIsOnTheWay’. Bitter feud: Mr Goldsmith hunting in the English countryside with rapper Jay Electronica, who has been exchanging messages with the financier's estranged wife . The Goldsmiths’ marital home was put on sale last month and friends said rumours of a split had been circulating because of the time Mrs Goldsmith was spending with the rapper. Divorce lawyers believe the case is likely to be the first high-profile court case of the ‘Twitter generation’. The Goldsmiths married in 2003, but their marriage ran into difficulties earlier this year. She went into the music industry with a company called Roundtable Records and was said to be leading an ‘increasingly nocturnal’ lifestyle. The couple had a trial separation before an apparent reconciliation, but Mr Goldsmith claimed to have discovered incriminating messages on his wife’s phone last week. She denied having an affair but reportedly admitted it after her husband said he had read the messages. He was said to have slapped her and kicked a child’s toy at her during the row, and she called the police. Several of Mr Goldsmith’s Twitter followers advised him not to air his marriage problems on the site. One wrote: ‘In the heat of heartache one tends to unveil more than necessary. Don’t bring your issues to tweet, it will hurt; pray instead.’ Mr Goldsmith replied: ‘Thanks, I agree. You’re kind.’","Ben Goldsmith split from wife Kate Rothschild after row over messages between her and rapper Jay Electronica .

"By . Chris Parsons . PUBLISHED: . 04:10 EST, 10 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:39 EST, 10 May 2012 . An air passenger has staked a claim as the ultimate frequent flyer - after clocking up a staggering 38 million airmiles. Jack Vroom made a long term investment in 1989 when he snapped up a lifetime, first class travel ticket for any global route from American Airlines for almost $500,000. And the Texan air traveller has racked up a record amount of mileage for the two decades since thanks to his supposedly 'unlimited' air pass for himself and any companion. Grounded: Jack Vroom has been denied his American Airlines unlimited pass after over 23 years . But after amassing enough air miles to circumnavigate the world 1,600 times, Mr Vroom has now been grounded - after American Airlines accused him of selling his companion tickets. Mr Vroom, 67, paid around $350,000 plus interest for the ticket 23 years ago, and at times travelled the world four times a week as he cashed in on his investment. He would regularly take friends and family on worldwide trips as his 'companion', and even helped fly home AIDS victims to see their families thanks to his extra seat. Mr Vroom bought the AAirpass in 1989 while working as a consultant for mail order catalogues. He already travelled alot by plane on business and bought the pass after hearing about it from a friend. Mr Vroom estimates that there are only around 40 people in the world who currently own the AAirpass, which the airline stopped selling in 2004. Premium access: Mr Vroom's pass allowed him first class travel with American Airlines on any global route . American Airlines removed Mr Vrooms AAirpass after making an accusation of fraud against the frequent flyer . When American Airlines calculated, . however, that the AAirpass used by Mr Vroom and other frequent flyers . was costing the airline around $1m a year, they grounded him over . accusations of 'improper activity'. Jack Vroom's 23 years as a holder of the AAirpass allowed him to make dozens of seemingly unnecessary journeys, all without spending a dime. One flight saw him travel from the U.S. all the way to London just so he could visit a Lush cosmetics store on the King's Road. He also flew to Washington D.C. to pick up his father-in-law so he could babysit for Vroom's children, explaining to a bemused passenger that it was 'cheaper than paying a local teenager'. When his son was in college Mr Vroom would regularly fly to Maine every Saturday to watch him play football. Other regular journeys saw him fly to Guadalajara, Mexico with a sheet of raw silver, where he would visit his favourite craftsmen and return with a bag full of newly-made belt buckles. The incident in 2009 has bought to a halt years of air travel which Mr Vroom said was 'like a 9 to 5 job'. Mr Vroom's staggering airmiles make George Clooney's, who clocks up a meagre 10 million miles in Up in the Air, look like a part-time flyer. Mr Vroom travelled around the U.S., as well as Europe and other parts of the world, often staying at his destination for just a few hours before flying back again without spending anything. He told CBS that during one flight he travelled to Milan just to pick up some exhaust pipes for a motorcycle. While his son was in college in Maine, Mr Vroom flew 2,000 miles every Saturday to watch him play football. His travel adventures have since ground to a halt following a flight back from London, where he had used his companion pass to fly his daughter's friend back to the U.S. An American Airlines spokesperson said . they still offer the lifetime pass, but have removed Mr Vrooms as they . 'had issues' with him. A . spokesperson said: 'Our AAirpass program, including unrestricted, . fixed-rate air travel to both domestic and international markets, is . expected to remain unchanged.' Small fry: George Clooney's character in Up in the Air clocks up a mere 10 million air miles - not a patch on Mr Vroom's 38 million . 'In addition, all VIP AAirpass privileges, including complimentary Admirals Club membership, Priority AAcess privileges, companion travel benefits and AAdvantage mileage accrual are expected to remain intact during the Chapter 11 process.' 'As part of our ongoing security practices and normal business operations at American Airlines, we actively analyze all of our ticketing and program policies for any improper activity, including with our AAirpass accounts.' 'If we determine that any activity has violated our policies or is fraudulent in nature, including the non-fraudulent provisions that were included in these original contracts in question, we take the actions we deem appropriate.'","Jack Vroom has completed enough flights to circumnavigate the world 1,600 times .

The KTM car appears to be an X-Bow model - one of only 30 made, which cost more than £60,000 each. The completely roofless super car is stripped to the bare basics and aimed at driving purists. It can do 0-60mph in 3.7 seconds and can reach a top speed of 137mph.

"By . James Tozer . PUBLISHED: . 10:50 EST, 30 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:39 EST, 30 May 2012 . Shafilea Ahmed, died at the age of 17 . The sister of a schoolgirl allegedly murdered by her strict Muslim parents yesterday denied that her account of witnessing the killing was a ‘wicked’ lie made up to ‘save her skin’. Alesha Ahmed told police she had seen their parents suffocating 17-year-old Shafilea with a plastic bag. She claims her sister’s desire to live a westernised lifestyle had brought ‘shame’ on family in the eyes of their Pakistani-born parents, Iftikhar Ahmed, 52, and his 49-year-old wife Farzana. But she did not accuse her parents of the killing until she was arrested for organising an armed robbery at the family home seven years after the alleged murder. Yesterday Alesha denied making up her version of events out of desperation after police saw through her lie that she hadn’t set up the robbery. And while she admitted she had initially accused her family of framing her over the break-in, she insisted she was now telling the truth. Cross-examining Alesha, her father’s barrister, Tom Bayliss QC, said: ‘You knew you could buy yourself out of trouble by making up a wicked story about your parents.’ She answered: ‘I don’t think the police are stupid enough to go on a story if they haven’t got any evidence.’ Mr Bayliss suggested her account was based on reading about the inquest into Shafilea’s death ‘and you used that knowledge to save your skin’. She denied this, adding: ‘It hasn’t saved my skin at all.’ Mr Bayliss also challenged her claim that she spoke out after being ‘haunted’ for years by the memory of Shafilea’s murder. He suggested she made her claims because ‘you’d just been caught red-handed committing a robbery at your parents’ house’. Alesha answered: ‘That’s not true.’ A group of men burst into the family home in Warrington, Cheshire in August 2010 while Mr Ahmed was out, tying up Alesha’s mother, brother and surviving sisters. Accused of murder: Shafilea's mother Farzana Ahmed, left, and Iftikhar Ahmed, right, deny murder . But Alesha wasn’t tied up. After the robbers escaped with cash and jewellery her family, who had heard them say her name, told police she had organised the raid. She was arrested and a mobile phone Sim card containing text messages she had exchanged with the robbers was recovered from a toilet down which she had attempted to flush it. Alesha, now 23, has pleaded guilty to involvement in the robbery but has not yet been sentenced. Jurors at Chester Crown Court have been told by the prosecution that she received no ‘inducements’ over her punishment in exchange for testifying against her parents. Speaking from behind a curtain shielding her from her parents in the dock, Alesha insisted she didn’t know the gang’s identities or how they got in. But she admitted that after police discovered the Sim card, she claimed her phone had been taken off her by her mother and younger sister Mevish the previous evening. Mr Bayliss said she had been trying to suggest any ‘incriminating text messages’ had been put there in order to frame her. Family home: The Ahmeds lived in this house in Warrington, Cheshire . Alesha admitted she had been trying to get herself out of trouble. ‘And the way you were doing that was to tell lies about your family,’ said Mr Bayliss. ‘Yes,’ she answered. He put it to her: ‘That’s you, Alesha Ahmed – you tell lies to get yourself out of trouble and you tell lies about your family.’ She answered: ‘On that occasion, yes.’ But she insisted she had been ‘open and honest’ in her evidence to the court. Mr Bayliss said tapes show that officers interviewing Alesha after the robbery told her ‘we can only help you if you help us’. They also told her ‘we are aware of how girls in Muslim families can be trapped, we know the price of not doing what you’re told’. He suggested she then asked for the recording to be stopped so she could play her ‘trump card’. ‘You decided to tell the police it was your parents who killed your sister and you did it to get yourself out of trouble,’ the barrister added. On . trial: Iftikhar Ahmed, left, and Farzana Ahmed, right, are said to have . killed their 17-year-old daughter because she refused to obey them . Denying his account, she sobbed as she answered that she had been ‘feeling really torn’ at the time. ‘I’ve got my sister who died on one side and my parents who I care about on the other,’ she added. Alesha claims her parents pushed Shafilea onto the settee at the family home in September 2003 following a row over the clothes she had worn to work. Their mother said: ‘Just finish it here.’ They then stuffed a plastic bag into her mouth and held it there until she stopped breathing, Alesha alleged. Five months later Shafilea’s decomposing body was found dumped beside a river in Cumbria. Mr and Mrs Ahmed both deny murder. The trial continues.

Derek Barnett, president of the Police Superintendents’ Association, attacked critics who, he says, believe officers are ‘fat, lazy blue-collar workers’. He warned there was a danger that the beleaguered rank and file may even come to believe the myth, adding: ‘There’s only so much that you can take before you start thinking there may be some truth in it.’ Fighting fit: Police critics have been attacked for for describing officers as 'fat, lazy blue collar workers' Simon Reed, vice-chairman of the .

The comments will be seen as an attack on Tom Winsor, whose appointment as Chief Inspector of the Constabulary has provoked fury from the Police Federation .

He said that as chief constable in Northern Ireland he would ask the inspectorate for advice on issues such as terrorism.

If his appointment is confirmed, he will be the first non-officer in the role in more than 150 years.

Cait Reilly, pictured, yesterday asked the High Court to declare the Government¿s back-to-work programme unlawful . A graduate made to work for her jobless benefits as a shelf stacker in Poundland yesterday claimed the scheme amounted to ‘forced labour’ which breached her human rights. Cait Reilly yesterday asked the High Court to declare the Government’s back-to-work programme unlawful after she was required to work in the budget store or risk losing her £53.45-a-week jobseeker’s allowance. The 23-year-old said she had to give up a voluntary post in a museum to take the placement but was promised a job interview if she completed two weeks training at Poundland. However, she says, that never materialised. The Government is fighting her claim . and strongly denies that its flagship work programme, which has placed . thousands of jobseekers on unpaid placements since its launch last year, . is equivalent to ‘slave labour’. Unemployed . mechanic Jamieson Wilson, 41, is also challenging the legality of . another Government work scheme that compels the jobless to take unpaid . work. Lawyers for the pair . are seeking a judicial review into the Department for Work and Pensions . programme, saying it violates Article 4 of the European Convention on . Human Rights, which prohibits forced labour and slavery. The . schemes, championed by Employment Minister Chris Grayling, aim to help . 250,000 young people over the next two years through training and unpaid . experience in the public, private and charity sectors. Placement-providers include chains such as Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Argos and . Asda. Miss Reilly, who graduated in geology . from Birmingham University in 2010, was placed on the scheme after . attending a retail jobs ‘open day’ in October last year at the . suggestion of her Jobcentre Plus adviser. Legal challenge: Cait Reilly, pictured, was 'forced' to leave her voluntary work at a museum to stack shelves at Poundland or risk losing her benefits . Only after attending was she told she had to undertake a period of training or risk losing her benefits. Nathalie Lieven, QC, appearing for . Miss Reilly, said her placement at Poundland, near her home in Kings . Heath, Birmingham, involved carrying out ‘menial’ tasks, adding: ‘Such . work did not contribute to (Miss Reilly’s) search for work to any . extent.’ Miss Reilly had undertaken the work under ‘menace of penalty’ in breach of her human rights, she added. Unhappy: Cait Reilly is shown outside the Poundland store in Birmingham where she claims she was forced to work . The court was told Poundland is a successful firm with a net turnover of £500million, and her placement did not contribute to the public interest. Miss Lieven told Mr Justice Foskett the way in which the back-to-work programme was administered was ‘blatantly unlawful’, and had put thousands at risk of unfairly losing their benefits. She also accused the Government of ‘seemingly sub-delegating to private sector providers’ how the schemes were run, including whether those who refused unpaid work should lose benefits. Miss Lieven added: ‘These claimants have an entitlement to subsistence-level benefits. 'Taking away these subsistence-level benefits for up to six months is in many ways just as fundamental as being detained as an immigrant in prison.’ The court heard that Mr Wilson, also from the Midlands, had been unemployed since 2008. He was told last November he would be required to undertake up to six months of unpaid work cleaning furniture. After refusing, he had his benefits cut, and now faces the loss of his jobseeker’s allowance for six months. Paul Nicholls, QC, appearing for the DWP, argued that both legal challenges were ‘wrong in law’. He said the purpose of the schemes was to assist the long-term jobless to better equip themselves for work, and thousands of people in different situations had benefited. The case continues.

Renshaw admitted causing death by dangerous driving and failing to stop at the scene of an accident and failing to report an accident. He told officers at the time he had no idea he had collided with a pedestrian and thought he may have hit a pothole. Renshaw, who has a conviction for . possession of cannabis and a reprimand and caution for the same offence, . showed no emotion as he was sentenced. The court heard how Owen was struck by Renshaw’s Fiat Seicento car while out playing with a friend near his home in Wakefield. The court was told the speed of the Fiat in the 30mph limit was 57mph and Owen was carried 75ft (23 metres) down the road by the impact, which one witness said sounded like a gunshot. Owen was hit a glancing blow by the car and was struck by the front of the vehicle before being pushed onto the bonnet, the court was told. Trial: Owen's parents Neil, 33, and Joanne, 31, arrive at Leeds Crown court for sentencing . Grief:  Neil and Joanne hold a picture of their beloved son. Mrs Wightman spoke of her heartbreak in a victim personal statement, briefly summarised for the court . Judge Geoffrey Marson, QC, said Owen was a much-loved boy whose death had devastated the family. He said: 'He had his whole life in front of him. From what I have read...he was a vibrant, happy child.' He said he was loved by his family, adding: ' That day in June last year has devastated their lives. Life will never be the same for them again. 'The death of a child is every parent’s worst nightmare.' Callous: Renshaw showed no emotion as the judge passed sentence . Judge Marson  Renshaw there were aggravating features to the case, in particular his failure to stop at the scene. The judge said as he fled the accident he was described as 'tanking on'. 'This gave no thought to the additional anguish to Owen’s family and you knew you had hit someone,' he said. He said Renshaw had shown a 'certain amount of remorse' but said it was difficult to accept his submission to police that he thought he was travelling within the speed limit. He said he also rejected his assertion that he had briefly walked back down the road after the collision. 'I entirely reject that last assertion. If you had walked back down the road you would have seen something,' he told him. He said Renshaw, who had completed his second year at university when the collision happened, would be affected by the tragedy for the rest of his life, but added: 'I have no doubt Owen’s family will say at least you will have a life to come back to.' The judge banned him from driving for six years and his licence was endorsed. Owen’s mother Joanne Wightman spoke of her heartbreak in a victim personal statement, briefly summarised for the court. In it she spoke of her 'inquisitive baby' who was quick to learn. Speaking about the day of the accident, she said: 'As I got to where Owen was I could see he was laid on the floor his head towards the kerb edge of the grass verge, there were people around him, they appeared to be working on him as if they were doing CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation). Anguish: Distraught father Neil carries his son's coffin. Owen was described as an 'inquisitive baby' who was quick to learn . 'I could see it was Owen, I wanted to . get to my baby, to cuddle him and make him well, but my legs were weak. As much as I tried to make my way to him I couldn’t get any closer to my . son.' 'Since this terrible . tragedy I have struggled to make sense of what had happened. I have an . empty space in my life which was once filled by my baby boy, like a . jigsaw with a piece missing. 'I struggle to make sense of what has . happened. I still believe he is at school and he will be coming home at . 3pm but then he doesn’t. Memory: Owen's mother Joanne's favourite picture of her son which she carries with her at all times . 'The . pain and grief has not subsided and although I know they say time is a . great healer, I can say that time will not heal my wounds, it will not . make me forget. 'I will always remember Owen. It will always hurt that his life was ripped from this world so early.' At . an earlier court hearing the prosecution alleged police found . 'additional' damage to Renshaw’s car which had been inflicted on the . vehicle with a 'view to disguise what had taken place.' Elements of the prosecution case were disputed by the defendant and a Newton hearing was held last month but halted when Renshaw eventually admitted failing to stop at the scene of an accident and failing to report an accident. The court was told he was also banned from driving for six months when he was 17 for having no insurance. On the day of the accident, the court was told he was delivering a Father’s Day card and present to his parents’ home in Emley, West Yorkshire, when he hit Owen who had stepped out into the road in a residential area close to his home. Renshaw’s barrister Richard Clewes said his client never intended the accident to happen.He added: 'He’s devastated by the loss he has caused and is extremely sorry for it, and in so far as he can, apologise for it.' He said he was 'basically a decent . person' who had 'wrestled with his conscience' in the days after the . accident and voluntarily handed himself in. He . said his university life was now over and he would struggle with a . custodial sentence. Outside court, Mrs Wightman questioned Renshaw’s . remorse. She told reporters: 'We miss Owen so much. It gets harder and harder without him. Our lives will never be the same again. 'Ripped from this world so early': Owen's mother Joanne watched as emergency workers tried to resuscitate her son as he lay by the side of the road . 'This lad has shown no remorse and if anything positive is to come out of this, it is that young drivers are deterred from speeding by thinking about what this has done to a family and a little boy’s life.' Jane Cryer, District Crown Prosecutor with the Crown Prosecution Service, said: 'Owen Wightman’s life was cut tragically short and his family suffered a heartbreaking and irreparable loss. 'The Wightman family have been foremost in our minds as we have built the prosecution case in close co-operation with West Yorkshire Police.'","Peter Renshaw, 22, killed Owen .

Barclays told Rachel Addison, from south west London, the missing money must be her own fault and refused to return it . Barclays Bank has admitted it made an embarrassing blunder by blaming an innocent victim of fraud when more than £1,000 was swiped from her account. Rachel Addison was told the missing money must be her own fault and refused to return it, This is Money reported today. Rachel had £1,150 stolen from her account in more 30 transactions, but the bank claimed her PIN was used and so accused her of being negligent, until This is Money stepped in and Barclays admitted it had blundered and the transactions were actually signed for fraudulently. In January when Rachel tried to use . her debit card and it was declined she immediately contacted Barclays to . find out what had happened. She . was told that her debit card, which was shortly due to expire, had . become invalid, as a new card had been posted out and used. But Rachel . had never received the card, let alone used it. It was then that she discovered more that £1,150 had gone from her account in a series of swift transactions over just two days. The . bank tried to force the 32-year-old, who lives in south west London, to . accept liability by accusing her of being negligent with her PIN. Rachel, . a publicity manager at Sony, had no idea that her replacement card had . been sent and consequently stolen. She refused to accept that it was her . fault. She said: 'I live alone and I’ve never written my PIN down or told any of my friends and family. I don’t know how it happened. She was told that five transactions . had cleared from her account, with a further 25 pending – a total of . £1,152.30. Each of the 30 payments was for £40 or just under. She . said at first Barclays told her the money would be put back into her . account. She said: 'I thought everything had been sorted out.' A spokesman for Barclays said: 'In this instance, due to human error the investigation was not undertaken properly and we incorrectly believed that the PIN was used for the transactions.' But then a week later Rachel was contacted by Barclays, which informed her that because the correct PIN had been used that she was liable for the full amount. Barclays told Rachel that because a replacement PIN was not sent with her card and because no cash withdrawals were attempted that it may be someone she knows. She said: 'The person implied that . someone else living in the property must have taken the card, a fact . which I disputed as I live alone. Or that I was guilty of negligence . with my personal information and had allowed someone to gain knowledge . of my pin, which I also strongly disputed.' Error: A letter sent to Rachel accusing her being negligent with her PIN . In . a letter from Barclays to Rachel, Jon-Marie Powney, a customer . relations manager, said: 'The very fact that the card has been misused . clearly indicates that the PIN was not adequately protected against . misuse.' Rachel also . contacted the police when the bank first told her that she would be . liable. However, she was told that it was up to the bank to report this . type of fraud and it would be up to Barclays to contact them. It . was then that Rachel contacted This is Money to see if we could help. Initially when we contacted Barclays, we were told that because Rachel . had used her PIN she would be held liable and the money would not be . refunded. 'I live alone and I’ve never written my PIN down or told any of my friends and family. I don’t know how it happened.' Rachel Addison . Rachel gave us a copy of the letter . that Barclays had sent detailing all of the transactions. There were 30 . payments, all for around £40 – the limit which banks check for fraud if . payments are unusual. Some of the transactions were at the same shop within minutes of each other. They just did not look possible. This is Money asked Barclays to review the case one more time, from the very beginning to make sure that her PIN had not been issued with the replacement card. Its fraud team discovered that the transactions were actually authorised by signature and not PIN, and that the signature was clearly not Rachel’s. It turned out that a mistake was made by a member of Barclays staff during the initial investigation. A bank spokesman said: 'All Barclays customers who are the innocent victim of fraud will be refunded their losses, however we do always need to investigate to ensure that it is fraud as we unfortunately receive many bogus claims. 'In this instance, due to human error the investigation was not undertaken properly and we incorrectly believed that the PIN was used for the transactions. 'Because of the other circumstances of this case, this meant that Ms Addison was held liable. 'We have since reviewed the case and discovered that the transactions were authorised by a signature which was not the customer's. We apologise to Ms Addison and have refunded the money to her immediately.' Barclays have also given Rachel £300 in the way of compensation. She said: ‘Thanks so much for all your help, I feel sure that I would have struggled to get any answers without your persistence.’","Bank refused to return cash to Rachel Addison .

When a Maryland cannibalism suspect had an outburst last year in a Morgan State University computer lab, college officials evaluated him and found that he didn't pose a threat to the campus. Now, a former student who said he was beaten with a baseball bat days before the gruesome attack says the university should have done more to warn people about Alex Kinyua, the man charged in both cases. Joshua Ceasar said Friday that if he had heard about the December outburst in the lab he would have steered clear of Kinyua and dodged an attack that left him partially blind. Joshua Ceasar (right) was left with a fractured skull and a blinded eye following the brutal attack, allegedly carried out by Alex Kinyua (left) The outburst got Kinyua kicked out of ROTC and led an instructor to tell police that Kinyua was 'Virginia Tech waiting to happen.' Kinyua also made cryptic comments about 'blood sacrifice' at a January university forum with administrators present. 'If I knew, I wouldn't have been anywhere near him or that building,' Ceasar said. His attorney, Steve Silverman, is exploring a lawsuit and investigating whether the university could have done more. The university is doing a 'top-to-bottom' review, but it appears procedures were followed, school spokesman Clinton Coleman said. Two campus officers visited Kinyua after the December outburst and he was assessed by the counseling center, Coleman said. 'If the university had reason to believe that any student or non-student represented a danger, of course the university would have taken the appropriate steps to remove the person from campus or render them harmless,' he said. In early May, police received a report that a young man matching Kinyua's description was carrying a machete around campus, Coleman said. Officers immediately tracked him to his room and searched, but didn't find such a weapon, he said. Ceasar, who remained friends with Kinyua's roommates even though he had transferred to another school, was on campus May 19 for a friend's graduation. He walked into Kinyua's apartment and was hit on the head with a baseball bat wrapped in chains and barbed wire. Ceasar, of Egg Harbor, New Jersey, said he doesn't know why Kinyua attacked him. Ceasar's friends told him they found Kinyua over Ceasar with a knife. Horrifying: Joshua Ceasar walked into Kinyua's apartment and was hit on the head with a baseball bat wrapped in chains and barbed wire . Days later, Ceasar learned Kinyua had . told the Harford County Sheriff's investigators that he used a knife to . kill and carve up Kujoe Bonsafo Agyei-Kodie, 37, before eating his . heart and brain. Agyei-Kodie, . a native of Ghana, had been staying at the Kinyua family's Joppatowne . home for about six weeks when he disappeared May 25. His body was found four days later about 15 miles away from campus. Investigators haven't given a possible motive. 'It freaked me out because I figured that's exactly what he was going to do to me if he was standing over top of me with a knife,' Ceasar said. 'He was probably planning to do that to me and that just doesn't sit easy with me. I think about it all the time.' Kinyua has been charged with assault and reckless endangerment in the Ceasar attack, and murder and assault in the killing. Attorney Richard Boucher, who represented Kinyua at a bail hearing in the assault, told the judge that Kinyua acted out of fear for his life when he hit Ceasar. Kinyua had told the attorney that Ceasar had told him he would have a gun the next time he saw him, he said. 'He felt threatened and that's why he responded in the manner that he did,' Boucher said. Ceasar said he never threatened Kinyua. Almost three weeks later, Ceasar says he still has not heard from anyone with the university. 'No school official has said anything to me,' he said. 'I feel like they haven't spoken about it because there is something to hide and they're trying to clean up.' Once the facts are known and the review is complete, Coleman said the university plans to inform the larger community.","Former student says he was beaten with a baseball bat days before gruesome attack .

Aspiring model: Sarah Shields, 23, was beaten up and strangled before being dumped in the sea while on holiday in Gran Canaria . A would-be glamour model was brutally murdered by her boyfriend during a holiday in Gran Canaria because she had been in contact with her former partner, police and prosecutors are claiming. Sarah Shields, 23, was beaten up and strangled to death by Chris Chittock, 38, before being dumped naked in the sea, prosecutors will allege at his trial. Her family raised the alarm after she failed to return home to Ipswich, Suffolk, after the two-week holiday on the Spanish island. Chittock allegedly sent his girlfriend's family texts from her mobile claiming she was back in Britain after her break. But her body was then washed up on Balito Beach, a popular tourist destination near Puerto Rico in the south west of Gran Canaria, sparking a murder investigation. Chittock, who lived with his young girlfriend, was arrested and extradited back to Spain following the death in July 2010. Spanish prosecutors want him jailed for 20 years if he is convicted of killing his lover in a trial next February. The prosecution claims that Chittock attacked Miss Shields after discovering that she had been in contact with her former boyfriend on Facebook. The defendant, an engineer at gas company BOC in Ipswich, had met his girlfriend at work and they had moved in together just four months before the holiday. She had posted on Facebook how excited she was to be going away with her boyfriend for the first time in the days before her break. An entry on a modelling website believed to have been written by Miss Shields in 2005 said she was working part-time for a retail chain but wanted to 'make a name for myself in the modelling industry'. She added she hoped to do topless or lingerie modelling before saying: 'One of my main influences is Katie Price.' Details of the case have emerged for the first time from the prosecution's indictment. It is alleged that Chittock hit his girlfriend in a violent rage in their room at the Balito Beach Apartments in Mogan. Chittock then dragged Sarah to the beach where he repeatedly punched her in the face before strangling her, it is claimed. Tests revealed that Sarah had suffered a broken nose. Accused: Chris Chittock, 38, will stand trial accused of murdering his girlfriend Sarah Shields, 23, while they were on holiday together in July 2010 . Shields is then said to have stripped . Miss Shields, burning her clothes in a nearby field, before throwing her . naked body into the sea. A post-mortem examination revealed that she had been strangled. Guardia Civil police found her body on July 7, 2010, about 50 feet from the shoreline. The Spanish authorities have been given permission to hold Chittock in custody for two years while they prepare the case. Brutal attack: Sarah had written on Facebook in the weeks before the Gran Canaria holiday that she was looking forward to going away with her boyfriend for the first time . Chittock was extradited after appearing before South East Suffolk magistrates' court, in Ipswich, shortly after he returned from holiday. The court heard in July 2010 how Chittock had allegedly sent texts from his girlfriend's phone. John Fenn, prosecuting, said: 'He [Chittock] returned to this country. He brought with him her [Miss Shields'] mobile phone. 'At various locations, he sent texts from her phone purporting to come from her to the effect that she was alive and well, whereas in fact she had been killed some days earlier.' At that hearing, Mark Holt, defending, said Chittock denied murdering Miss Shields. Holiday island: The couple were staying near Puerto Rico (pictured) on Gran Canaria for their two-week holiday in July 2010 . Sarah's family are concerned that Spanish prosecutors will not tell them when the murder trial is due to start. Her older brother Paul Davies said: 'I have had to track down any information myself. We believe the trial will be in February but no one has been able to confirm that officially with me. 'I have spoken to the Foreign Office and the British Consulate but no one seems to be able to push the case, it seems utterly ridiculous. 'We are worried it could all go ahead without us knowing. 'Someone will be informing his [Chittock's] family - it seems very unfair that they are not obliged to let us know.' Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Sarah Shields, 23, was discovered dead in the sea after her boyfriend Chris Chittock, 38, returned home alone after their holiday .

"Rufus the four-year-old Harris Hawk was snatched overnight while he slept on a private driveway . He stopped pigeons pooing on tennis fans and interrupting play . Thieves also stole Rufus' cage, glove and hood . By . Ian Garland . UPDATED: . 16:26 EST, 30 June 2012 . The hawk that patrols the skies over Wimbledon to deter pigeons has been stolen. The American Harris hawk, named Rufus, was taken together with its cage and  handling glove overnight between Thursday and Friday from a car parked in Wimbledon. Rufus was in the car on a  private driveway in Dunstall Road with its rear window open for ventilation. For the past four years, the hawk has spent every morning of the Championships scaring pigeons away from the hallowed grass. Scroll down for video . On the job: Rufus the American Harris Hawk, on duty at Wimbledon with his owner Wayne Davis . Looking out over Wimbledon's courts the resident Harris Hawk keeps an eye out for pigeons . Owner Imogen Davis, 25,  said she was still in shock after Rufus’s disappearance. ‘It’s really, really sad,’ she said. ‘He was taken in his travelling box, . which is where he sleeps because it’s nice and dark and cool and he can . fall asleep in there. ‘We’re very shocked – we just want to know that he is OK.’ Ms Davis said Rufus was reared by the family-run business, Avian Environmental Consultants. She added: ‘We work as a team together. To have him taken away like that is just  horrible. ‘It’s a family business, the birds are brought up around us. They’re part of the family. It’s just the way it is.’ Rufus this week, chasing pigeons away from Centre Court . Pigeons are not the Harris Hawk's natural prey, and they are trained not to attack but to circle and fly around the courts to scare the birds . Ms Davis said she originally thought . it was a prank, but was not sure as a falconry glove and falconry hood . were stolen at the same time. ‘Initially I was almost hoping that it . was a prank because there was more possibility of us getting him back, . and somebody would realise it was a  stupid thing to do,’ she added. ‘But because the hood and the glove were taken, I’m not sure. I suppose at least it means he’s being looked after. ‘We have another hawk and we can still do our job but we would like Rufus back because we’re very fond of him.’ Bird's-eye view: Rufus even has his own pass for Wimbledon which reads: Bird Scarer . Rufus the Hawk, on Centre Court on Wednesday with handler Imogen Davis. Miss Davis is in shock after the theft and has appealed for his safe return .

'They are distressed over the theft and are appealing for help . to recover the bird.’ Rufus has become a well-known fixture . at the South-West London tennis club, with visitors often stopping to . ask for photos with the hawk. He even has his own Twitter account, but there has not been a tweet for a day. His last tweet was before Rafael .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 03:36 EST, 29 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:25 EST, 29 June 2012 . Georgina Blackwell is celebrating securing a First Class Honours law degree . She may be a young blonde beautician from Essex but Georgina Blackwell certainly does not live up to any of the usual stereotypes. Miss Blackwell first hit the headlines when, aged just 23 and with no formal legal qualification, took on one of the country’s biggest homebuilders in the High Court - and won. And that proved to be a turning point for the 26-year-old who had almost given up on a dream of becoming a lawyer to work in the family-owned salon in . picturesque Halstead, Essex, after her mum broke her wrist. After the stunning success against Bellway in 2009, Miss Blackwell was offered a law scholarship at BPP University in London. She is now celebrating again after securing a First Class honours in her law degree, the top grade possible. A delighted Georgina said: ‘Just over . two years ago I was working in the salon and I would never have dreamed . that I would complete a law degree and get First Class Honours. ‘If someone had told me that, I would not have believed them. ‘It all has happened too quickly, I . don’t feel as though I have had time to take it all in. The past couple . of years have been a complete whirlwind for me.’ The qualified beautician, who will . start training to become a barrister later this year, added: ‘I was . waiting for my results to arrive on e-mail and I must have refreshed the . inbox a thousand times before they arrived. ‘When I saw that I had got a First, I was running around the garden, screaming my head off. ‘The neighbours must have thought I . was completely crazy but I don’t care - I was just so relieved as I was . totally focused on getting a First.’ Georgina added: ‘If it had not been . for the legal battle against the developers, I am not sure I would have . been where I am today, so it was a blessing in disguise. ‘I would have still be in the salon, like I had been for the previous six years, and this might not have ever happened.’ Georgina Blackwell is as comfortable in the beauty salon as she is presenting complex legal cases before a High Court judge . Miss Blackwell, from Colchester, Essex . acted as a lawyer for her mum Sandra, in a bitter battle against . Bellway Homes after it had filled the garden next to their beauty salon . with scaffolding and debris. The beautician was dubbed ‘Legally Blonde’ after she secured an unlikely victory against the wealthy developers. She said her dad, Clive, 72, had been a massive inspiration for her. She . said: ‘Dad knew how upset I was when I could not take my original place . to study law, so when I phoned him and told him the news, he was so . happy for me and was choked up.’ Georgina’s . success means she has been lucky enough to secure a scholarship which . will pay for the majority of the £16,000 costs of her nine-month course . to become a barrister. Georgina had almost given up on fulfilling her dream of becoming a lawyer after ditching the chance to study law in order to work in the family's beauty salon to help her mother Sandra, right, who had broken her wrist . However, the costs of her commute into London from her home in Essex means that she will still be doing a part-time job to help fund the costs. And she said, time allowing, she will always be happy to help out her mum, Sandra, 55, at her salon, House of Beauty. Georgina’s legal journey started when . her mum bought a Grade II-listed 600-year-old home - a former school and . tailor’s shop - to set up her beauty salon. But . soon after moving in, Bellway Homes purchased an empty factory which . backed onto the salon’s garden with the intention of building 43 homes. Her . mum had been taken to court in July 2009 after she refused builders . access across her garden to demolish two factory walls which formed part . of Bellway’s Church View development. After . losing the case Mrs Blackwell was faced with losing her home and . business after spending £3,000 on legal advice and was ordered to pay . Bellway’scosts of £22,000 as well as a ‘five-figure sum’ in damages for . delays to the building work. Georgina Blackwell took on Belway Construction after they started demolishing their garden walls and building scaffolding over their garden in Halstead, Essex . After the original case, builders moved onto the garden and filled it with scaffolding. Bright-spark . Georgina sprang into action, checking deeds and documents to the house . and realised the right of access was only to reach one wall of the . factory not two. And despite coming face-to-face with . the developer’s top legal team, Georgina wowed the court with her legal . arguments and cross examination, going on to win the case. In . the High Court, Mrs Justice Proudman overturned the previous decision . and ordered Bellway Homes to pay Mrs Blackwell £75,000 compensation. Speaking after the original hearing, Georgina said: ‘I’m a blonde beautician from Essex. I think they underestimated me. Bellway put scaffolding in Mrs Blackwell's garden and began demolition, which was halted after they lost the court case . ‘They looked intimidating in their wigs and gowns, it was terrifying. I felt absolutely scared stiff by the huge courtroom and speaking in front of a high court judge but I got a surge of adrenalin and thought, ‘they aren’t going to intimidate me’.’ After hearing of the case, Peter Crisp, Dean of BPP Law School wrote to Georgina in November 2009, offering her a scholarship. She completed BPP’s two-year law degree programme, which started in May 2010 and finished last month. Georgina will receive her degree at an official graduation ceremony in London in November.","Georgina Blackwell had no formal qualification when she won a High Court battle with Bellway Homes in a bitter access dispute .

Penteado, from Bournemouth, was granted bail while a pre-sentence report is prepared. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . In court: Rogue Traders' Dan Penteado (left) faces jail after pleading guilty to council tax and housing benefit fraud to the tune of more than £24,000. Pictured right is his co-presenter Matt Allwright (right) Dan Penteado, who famously uses a motorbike to track down fraudulent traders on the show, arrives at Bournemouth Magistrates Court today on the back of a motorbike . The case was adjourned until July 17 at Bournemouth Magistrates’ Court. Kerry O'Neill, prosecuting, said the . offences went back to 2007 when Penteado filled out his first claim form . and failed to declare he had another bank account. The court heard that Penteado repeated the fraud in subsequent years up to 2011. In that time he failed to tell . Bournemouth Borough Council he had been paid more than £56,000 for his . work on Rogue Traders from 2008 to 2011. Miss O'Neill said: 'On the 17 October 2007 the defendant completed a housing . benefit and a council tax benefit application form and on that . particular form he failed to disclose that he had another bank account . with Nationwide. 'On 1 March 2008 he again signed further forms verifying and clarifying that he didn’t have other bank accounts. 'On 14 January 2009 he signed another verification form stating that . information until this date was true and accurate. It was not true as he . had failed to disclose the Nationwide bank account.' Miss O’Neill told the court that in 2008 the council became aware that . Penteado had received more than £16,000 from the BBC but had . failed to let them know. Guilty: Dan Penteado (left) admitted pocketing more than £24,000 of government payouts he wasn't entitled to . She said: 'Between 16 April 2008 and 15 September 2008 it became known . to the borough council that the defendant received £16,551.30 from . the BBC but the defendant failed to disclose this information to the . borough council.' Penteado continued to fail to tell the council about payments from the . BBC while still completing forms for housing and council tax benefit. Between 24 July 2009 and 1 May 2010 Penteado received £15,605.27 for his work on Rogue Traders. He received an additional £18,016.92 from the 2 July 2010 until 7 January 2011. Miss O’Neill said: 'On the 28 May 2010 the defendant completed a . verification form for housing and council tax benefit application, on . this form he failed to disclose that he had been receiving payment from . the BBC or that he had contracts for them.' He also received £6,259.50 between 4 May 2011 and 2 September 2011 but failed to notify the council. As a result Penteado received £24,077.60 of housing and council tax benefit that he wasn’t entitled to. Miss O’Neill said: 'Since March 2012 three payments of £70 have been paid back in respect of the sum owed. That leaves the outstanding sum of housing benefit and council tax benefit which he is not entitled to as $23,867.60.' The court heard the council, which . brought the prosecution, would be seeking to recover all the cash. No mitigation was put put forward by his solicitor, Terrence Scanlan, at the hearing.

"Leanne Wertheim used four different eBay accounts to sell fake products . Imitation cosmetics found to contain three times the legal amount of lead, which can cause brain damage . She was given an eight month suspended sentence and ordered to carry out 160 hours community service after being sentenced at Cardiff Crown Court . By . Luke Salkeld . PUBLISHED: . 05:53 EST, 4 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:30 EST, 4 July 2012 . Leanne Wertheim, 24, was caught running the highly-profitable make-up scam from her bedroom . A woman who sold toxic imitations of well-known make-up brands online has been spared jail. Leanne Wertheim used four separate eBay accounts to sell £40,000 worth of fake products – including copies of Max Factor and Bobbi Brown – to unsuspecting customers. The 24-year-old posted out the poisonous Chinese-made copies from her bedroom. Some, which she claimed were from high-end companies such as MAC, Benefit and Lancome, contained three times the legal amount of lead, which can cause brain damage. Wertheim, a mother-of-one, offered online buyers what seemed like amazing bargains, claiming to sell products worth up to £30 on the high street for as little as £3.99. But in reality the care worker had bought the fake make-up from China on the internet. When buyers complained about the quality, she insisted the items were authentic, Cardiff Crown Court was told. After a complaint, Trading Standards investigators posed as customers to buy the make-up from Wertheim. Tests on the imitation cosmetics revealed they contained more than three times the legal amount of lead, a metal linked to side-effects including brain damage, a lowering of IQ in unborn babies and behaviour problems. One, a counterfeit Max Factor mascara, was found to contain 68mg/kg of lead, the legal level being 20mg/kg. Leanne Wertheim, pictured at Cardiff Crown Court, was given an eight month suspended sentence . Toxic: Some of the fake cosmetics found in Wertheim's home, including imitation 'Benefit' cosmetics, which usually retail in expensive department stores . Leanne Wertheim, pictured centre, pleaded guilty to five charges under the Trade Mark Act . Prosecutor Lee Reynolds said: . ‘[Wertheim] was running large eBay accounts selling make-up. When test . purchases were carried out [the] mascara and foundation were found to be . fakes.’ Officers then raided her house and . found unsold items waiting to be put on the internet. By the time . Trading Standards closed down her scheme, Wertheim, from Gilwern in . Monmouthshire, south Wales, had sold £25,000 of fake make-up, with . £15,000 worth waiting to be sold. Online shoppers offer an easy market for cosmetic fraudsters. There is a ‘big trade in fakes’ as criminals seek to cash in on the popularity of leading brands.But for customers tempted by the cheaper prices and convenience of shopping online, there are some golden rules to follow to avoid being ripped off. The consumer website spotcounterfeits.co.uk advises:  ‘Know the products before you shop. Check them out in a reputable store, look closely at the names and packaging.’ The site warns shoppers buying Chanel cosmetics online to be aware the genuine items ‘invariably come only in black cases’ and always carry the ‘simple Chanel double C’ logo. It warns fans of MAC make-up that ‘real items have the barcode as a sticker on the box, as well as having the colour name and finish on a sticker on the top of the box’. She admitted five charges under the . Trades Mark Act 1994, claiming she was ‘more naive than calculated’ and . didn’t realise what she was selling was fake. But Judge Stephen Hopkins QC told . her: ‘I don’t think you are naive, I think you set up to deliberately . make money from customers, many of whom were very gullible. ‘You assured them the items were . authentic, furthering your deceit, and you opened extra eBay accounts to . cover your tracks. 'You sold items for £3.99 which would have sold [for] . between £20 and £30 on the high street. ‘These genuine businesses can expect the courts to deal with people who exploit customers.’ As for online customers, he warned, they ‘would do well to remember the . saying if something is sold at a price that seems too good to be true, . it probably is’. Wertheim was given an eight-month . suspended prison sentence, told to carry out 160 hours’ community . service and pay costs of £2,000. She has already spent most of the money . she earned through the scam so there will be no proceeds of crime . hearing. The remaining make-up will be destroyed. The court did not hear whether her . customers received refunds. However eBay users who pay via PayPal are . covered by the eBay Buyer Protection scheme, under which they can apply . for refunds. An eBay spokesman added: ‘eBay does not allow the sale of counterfeit . goods. We have an established programme... to remove items from sale . that cause concern.’ £15,000 worth of fake make-up and cosmetics were seized from Leanne Wertheim's home .

But they became multi-millionaires after setting up a financial IT firm. The estranged couple, Jennifer Evans, left, and Mark Evans, right, pictured leaving London's Court of Appeal . The couple, who have two teenage daughters, separated in July 2010, with Mrs Evans starting divorce proceedings last April. Mr Evans’s shares in their computer firm, Confluence Corporation, are believed to be worth at least £40million. Their non-business assets are valued at about £12million. This year, Mrs Evans, 46, who lives in a £10.6million apartment near . Harrods in Knightsbridge, West London, was awarded assets worth . £26million by a family judge.

They enjoyed the use of private jets and first-class travel and . retaining personal assistants and household staff.’ Lord Justice Thorpe criticised the couple for their handling of the . divorce, adding: ‘It seems to me almost puerile, these very rich people . distrusting and disliking each other intensely.

He said the decree absolute was ‘long overdue’ but added that even the . smallest risk that Mrs Evans could be deprived of her share of the . marital assets should be eliminated.

Casey Anthony, dubbed the most hated mother in America, had suspicions that she and her daughter Caylee shared the same father, according to her former defence attorney. In his explosive new tell-all, the Florida woman’s lawyer Jose Baez accuses George Anthony of abusing his daughter, and speculates that George could have murdered 2-year-old Caylee to hide evidence of abuse. Casey was sensationally acquitted of murdering her daughter after a highly-publicised trial last July.In his book, Presumed Guilty, Casey Anthony: The Inside Story, Baez reveals aspects of the Anthony’s private lives that were not looked into during the trial. Accused: Casey Anthony's lawyer accused her father George, left, of sexually assaulting her, and speculates that he killed Casey's daughter Caylee to cover up the abuse . Troubled past: Casey Anthony, centre, pictured July 7th, 2011, says she was frequently molested by her father and told her lawyer that she feared he was Caylee's father . The lawyer accused George of killing the toddler to hide evidence of abuse. Baez first made the shocking allegation at the trial’s opening statements, saying that George killed Caylee, disposed of the girl’s remains, and then lied about it to authorities. Casey confided in Baez that she was worried her father might have fathered Caylee, because he had sex with her around the time she had become pregnant. DNA tests later revealed that George was not the father. George, through a family attorney, denied ever abusing Casey. However, Casey and her father have reportedly been estranged since October 14, 2008, the day, CF 13 News notes, that he testified against her, leading to the grand jury indicting her for murder.He testified in the trial: ‘I would have done anything I could to save my granddaughter.’ Casey Anthony's defense attorney: Jose Baez gestures as he speaks about his just-published book Presumed Guilty, Casey Anthony: The Inside Story almost a year to the day she was acquitted . One year on: Casey was sensationally acquitted by a jury last July 5, left, and walked free from jail just over a week later, right . Someone in the Anthony house . conducted several suicide-related searches on the family computer, . including ‘fool-proof suffocation’ and ‘venturing into the pro-suicide . pit’ on the day little Caylee Anthony vanished, Casey Anthony’s defence . attorney Jose Baez said. The . attorney revealed that the searches were conducted around an hour after . Casey’s father George Anthony said she left the home. While . last year’s trial famously revealed that the family computer also had . searches for ‘chloroform,’ the suicide searches were not revealed, Baez . said, because they were discovered after the fact. He told Good Morning America: ‘I have . a hard time believing that law enforcement wouldn’t check the internet . history of the day that the child went missing. That would have been . bombshell evidence in the trial if it had come out.’ Jose Baez, Casey Anthony's defense lawyer, has written a tell-all book about the case . Prosecutors claimed Anthony . suffocated Caylee with duct tape so she could spend time with her . boyfriend and be free for Orlando's nightlife. Baez said during the trial - repeated . again in his book - that Caylee accidentally drowned in a family . swimming pool and that her father, George Anthony, hid the body. Baez . also claimed George Anthony sexually abused his daughter. George Anthony denied both . allegations, and there was little brought up about them during the . trial. Baez said the defence wasn't required to put on any such evidence . because proving the case is the prosecution's burden, not the other way . around. George Anthony tried to commit . suicide in January 2009, and was found in a Daytona Beach hotel after . overdosing on prescription drugs. A five-page suicide note was also . discovered at the hotel. Baez told GMA that it was hard to . determine who in the Anthony family conducted what searches on January . 16, 2008, but said it was possible to infer who searched what, based on . the terms searched. For instance, one of the terms . searched was ‘foolproof suffocation.’ Baez noted that the terms were . spelled incorrectly, and that George struggled with good spelling. He wrote in his book: ‘By looking at . the websites being researched, all concerned with suicide and death, it . certainly appears that the one who felt the blame was a guilt-ridden . George Anthony.’ In his book, Baez also lashes out at . several entities - calling the media a 'monster', the police 'careless' and the prosecution 'scheming and ruthless'. He wrote: 'This was not real life, it was the media's Casey Anthony . reality show, a show that depended on name-calling and controversy for . television ratings.' Evidence and testimony showed that Casey was a habitual liar, even making up fake friends and pretending . every day to go to a job she didn't have at Universal Studios. Baez was asked whether . Anthony's lies surrounding her daughter's disappearance might be . indicative that she was guilty. Counsel: Defence attorney Jose Baez talks to . Casey Anthony during her trial when the jury heard her father say . her car smelled of human decomposition. Baez revealed in his book he also thought he could smell a dead body . Innocent: Mystery surrounds the cause of Caylee Anthony's death after her mother was acquitted of her murder one year ago today . 'I don't think the lies are . indicative of innocence or guilt,' he said. 'The lies were there long . before Caylee passed away.' In the book, he says Anthony had built a . 'fantasy world,' and her lies weren't evidence of guilt but signs of . someone with 'serious mental health issues.' Baez said one piece of prosecution . evidence he was most concerned about was that police cadaver dogs had . indicated a body may have been in the trunk of Anthony's car at one . point and also that a body may have been in the backyard. None was . discovered in the backyard and there was nothing but rotting bags of . trash in the trunk. But, he said, people - and jurors - believe in dogs. 'That concerned me a little bit. Most people really think dogs can do magic,' Baez said. He also strongly considered early in the case whether she should plead guilty to . a lesser charge to avoid the death penalty if convicted of murdering . her two-year-old daughter Caylee, but Anthony adamantly insisted she had . nothing to do with the toddler's death. New Look: The last time the public saw Casey was when this video was released in October. She is said to be living in Palm Beach, Florida . 'Found': West Palm Beach, Florida, where Casey Anthony is reported to be staying with a friend . Baez said . prosecutors offered in 2008 to allow Anthony to plead guilty to . aggravated manslaughter of a child and serve up to 13 years in prison. He said that in those early days he thought taking it might be in . Anthony's best interest. 'There were times, difficult times, . when the evidence didn't look good for Casey,' Baez said, adding that it . was his obligation as a lawyer to convey any such plea offers. The prosecution's flaw, he added, was . that regarding the car search the dog and handler were focused only on . Anthony's vehicle and did not include others in a lineup to give the dog . options. Overall, Baez attributed the strong . public backlash against the jury's verdict to a lack of understanding . about the judicial system and because 'a lot of people bought into the . hype' that Anthony must have been guilty. He noted that jurors who gave . media interviews after the trial said they waited for weeks for strong . evidence that never came. 'We need to talk about whether an actual murder occurred,' he said. 'That's where the focus should have been, and it never was.' Baez declined to comment on what . Anthony is doing these days and on how often he talks to her. He said he . promised her confidentiality when she agreed that he could write his . book, in which she did not participate. Anthony is living in an . undisclosed location in Florida serving probation for an unrelated . conviction, which Baez said ends on August 21. Parents: George and Cindy Anthony both lied to cover up what really happened to Caylee, claims Baez . 'She's doing a lot better than she was in prison,' Baez said, but then added: 'She's a prisoner of her own freedom.' Anthony, he said, 'would not . entertain it for a second'. As he became more familiar with the state's . mostly circumstantial case, Baez said he grew convinced she would be . acquitted by a jury – as she was a year ago today of all charges except . for four misdemeanors of lying to investigators. 'There was nothing in the trial that . ever made me think Casey was guilty of anything as related to the . murder,' Baez said. 'Every single piece of evidence favored us.' He told CBS' Crimesider: 'I think Casey Anthony's story, the whole case, was a media phenomenon. And I say that because she was young, pretty and white. 'If it didn't have those elements to it I don't think it would have taken off.' Prosecutors claimed Anthony . suffocated Caylee with duct tape so she could spend time with her . boyfriend and be free for Orlando's nightlife.","In new tell-all, former defence attorney Jose Baez accuses father George Anthony of sexually abusing Casey .

Despite standing down as a controversial global trade ambassador the Duke of York still managed to rack up £378,249 on taxpayer-funded flights . High fliers: Prince William and his wife Kate, pictured leaving Los Angeles last July, spent an incredible £52,000 on the one-way flight from LA to London for themselves and their seven-strong entourage . On the up: The Queen's official expenditure increased from £32.1million in 2010/11 to £32.3million in 2011/12 . The second most expensive trip of the year was taken by Prince Harry . whose successful jubilee tour to Belize, the Bahamas, Jamaica and Brazil . cost taxpayers £107,098 plus a further £18,101 on flights for staff . conducting reconnaissance. Andrew managed to spend £236,088 on foreign tours for UK Trade and . Industry, even after stepping down as its Special Representative in . July. This includes £19,987 in October last year on scheduled flights to and . from the Far East and a further £72,250 on a private jet for the same . tour which took in China, Hong Kong and Malaysia – £92,237 in total. He also spent £81,000 last September on a private jet to Saudi Arabia, a . further £18,709 on scheduled flights to Singapore and £14,196 on . tickets to Qatar and Abu Dhabi in November. Then there was £29,946 on . scheduled flights to Thailand in February. Royal aides stressed yesterday that the trips were already in the . prince’s diary and that he was duty-bound to meet those commitments. Details of the trips emerged in the annual Royal Public Finance Report, . which lays bare how much the Queen gets from the public purse over the . year 2011-2012 and how she spends it. Official expenditure rose marginally to £32.3million – up £200,000 or 0.6 of a per cent. But Buckingham Palace aides stressed that they had actually realised a . 26 per cent reduction in spending over the last three years in real . terms. They say the monarchy costs just 52p a head for every man, woman . and child in the country – although this does not include the estimated . £200million bill for security. Prince Andrew, pictured in 2009, is nicknamed Air Miles Andy because of his love of travelling by helicopter. Taxpayer cash used to pay for official Royal Family air and rail travel at home increased to £6.1million in 2011/12 .

Their private jet for the trip cost taxpayers £460,387 . Making friends: Prince Harry poses with Usain Bolt in Kingston, Jamaica, during his jubilee tour on behalf of the Queen in March. The trip cost £107,098 . ‘The Queen was very keen that the Royal Household should play its part . in reducing expenditure and she is pleased that this has been achieved,’ said Sir Alan Reid, Keeper of the Privy Purse. Sir Alan said they had cut their costs by freezing staff pay and . generating more income by renting out royal property. But he also . revealed they would need to eat into their savings by £3million to meet . the cost of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations. The report only details . journeys by air or on the royal train costing £10,000 or over – 72 in . all this year.  Easily the most expensive trip of the year was Prince . Charles’s tour of the Middle East and Africa last November with the . Duchess of Cornwall. It cost £460,387 to hire the couple a jet. The prince and his wife also spent £19,583 taking the Royal Flight down . from Scotland, where they were on holiday, last August to visit some of . London’s riot-hit streets. Younger members of the Royal Family were also clocking up the air miles – . although the publicity and goodwill generated by Prince Harry’s . inaugural royal tour earlier this year is said by Foreign Office sources . to be ‘incalculable’. William and Kate are also likely to raise eyebrows over the bill for . their first tour as a royal couple to Canada and the US last year, . booking business class flights home from LA for themselves and seven . staff costing £51,410. William and Kate and their adviser, Sir David Manning, were then given a free upgrade to first class by British Airways. A senior royal aide defended the costs saying that William, Kate and . Harry in particular had shown enormous willingness to embrace ‘a . different style of travel’ – for that read less expensive – to ‘older . members of the Royal Family’. Aides stressed all foreign trips were taken at the request of the . Government and Foreign and Commonwealth Office and were rubber-stamped . by the palace’s visits committee to ensure they were as cost effective . as possible. Anti-monarchist group Republic rejected palace claims of frugality and . accused it of being ‘one of the most profligate institutions in the . world’. Expensive upkeep: Royal 'bean counters' said they had managed to reduce their spending by 26 per cent in real terms over the last three years .

The . son of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding star Paddy Doherty was jailed for . almost four years today after causing the death of a friend in a horrific car . crash following a night out in a pub. David Doherty was . also banned from driving for four years after a jury heard how he . ‘wickedly’ fled the scene in front of arriving police officers amid . claims he was drunk. Already . disqualified and driving without insurance, Doherty, 27, crashed his . Mitsubishi Shogun into a Renault van parked in a lay-by off a dual . carriageway in North Wales in March. Traveller kin: David Doherty, right, with his father Paddy, who has featured regularly in the Channel 4 TV show My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding . The traveller's front seat passenger James Loveridge, 38, a father of four, was declared dead at the scene. Four others were hurt, including van driver Victor McClelland, who is still being treated for multiple injuries. Mr McClelland, who was left in a coma . for two weeks, had just returned from holiday and, because he was tired, . decided to pull over and sleep in the back of the van. But Doherty – believing the layby was . an exit slip road - drove into the back of the vehicle, spinning it . around, and throwing Mr McClelland out. The victim landed on the . dual-carriageway, where it is believed he was run over by another . vehicle as the driver tried to avoid the crash debris. Doherty, whose father has been . involved in several bare-knuckle boxing matches and has recently become a . friend of the House of Commons Speaker's wife Sally Bercow  since they . appeared together on Celebrity Big Brother, was heard to say: ‘I was . asleep and woke up to this.’ Danger: Doherty ploughed into Victor McClellan'd van which was parked on a lay-by of the the A55 (pictured) at Talybont, Gwynedd, North Wales . Jailing him for three years and 10 . months at Mold Crown Court, Judge Niclas Parry said: ‘What followed can . only be described as an act of sheer wickedness in what I consider to be . an entirely separate act of criminality. ‘Knowing what you had done, knowing . you passenger was dead or dying, or at the very least seriously injured, . you left without any regard for anyone else. ‘You did not stay to call for assistance but you fled the scene. ‘You stole another vehicle, for the . second time that morning drove while disqualified and without insurance, . in order to avoid detection. ‘It also meant it was not possible for you to be tested for alcohol.’ Doherty - who denies that he was over . the limit and says he probably mistook the lay-by for a nearby slip road . - admitted causing death by careless driving at 4am on the Westbound . carriageway of the A55 at Talybont, Gwynedd, on March 18 this year. He also admitted driving while disqualified, without insurance, failing to stop and failing to report the accident.

Squaring up: Eight men have now admitted their involvement in the violence which erupted as part of a long-standing feud between the groups . He went on to admit driving the . Land Rover without consent and without insurance together with a separate . incident of dangerous driving in Manchester in May of last year when he . fled at speed from police, together with other motoring offences. An earlier charge of causing death by dangerous driving was dropped. Doherty, who lives with his family at the Riverside Traveller’s Park in Queensferry, initially denied being behind the wheel. But he changed his plea when his DNA . was found in his blood and saliva on the air bag of the crashed Shogun, . proving conclusively that he was the driver. His DNA was also found in the . Land Rover he stole and fled the scene in, despite his initial claim that . his brother had picked him up and that he had left after a bump to the . head not realising the seriousness of what had happened. Mr McClelland had a fractured skull, . bleeding into the brain, a fractured cheek bone and shoulder, bruised . chest, lung damage, his pelvis was shattered and he had three fractures . to his neck. Bloodied: Paddy Doherty after part of his ear was bitten off, in an image originally posted to his Twitter page . In a victim impact statement he told how it had been totally life-changing. Doherty’s passengers Thomas Ward, Paul . Hulse and Mark Evans were also hurt during the trip to Anglesey to Chester, where . they had been in a pub just hours earlier. Mr Ward had a broken neck, spine damage and would have to spend up to six months in a ‘halo’ frame. Mr Hulse had a fractured neck and collar bone and other injuries to his knee and hand. Mr Evans had a laceration to his face. Judge Niclas Parry said that as a . result of Doherty’s irresponsible driving, a young man was killed, an . entirely innocent man suffered life-threatening injuries, and three of . his other passengers were seriously hurt. He had been in a pub the previous . evening in Chester, with passengers he drove while disqualified and . without passengers, and did not think it important enough to have . sufficient regard for the safety of other road users. The incident occurred while he was on bail for an earlier allegation of dangerous driving in Manchester. The case in Mold was also seriously . aggravated by his previous convictions for dangerous driving, careless . driving, no insurance and drink driving.

Mystery: Christopher Brahney disappeared after losing his mobile phone at the band's reunion concert at Manchester's Heaton Park on June 29 . Coronation Street bosses have scrapped a plot line in which a body is pulled from a canal because it bore too many similarities to the mystery death of a Stone Roses fan. Christopher Brahney disappeared after losing his mobile phone at the band's reunion concert at Manchester's Heaton Park on June 29. After an exhaustive search of the city, his body was found in the Manchester Ship Canal near Media City in Salford Quays on Monday. But out of respect for the 22-year-old's family and friends, producers of the ITV soap said they have decided to pull the scenes which were filmed weeks ago. An ITV spokesperson said: 'The producers of Coronation Street have . taken the decision to remove references in this Friday's show, which . although scripted and filmed weeks ago, bore some similarities to the . manner in which Christopher Brahney’s body was found. 'Like many others, we were extremely saddened by the news of his death, and our thoughts and condolences are with his family.' Mystery continues to shroud Mr Brahney's . death - which has sent shockwaves through the UK music community - . after a post mortem failed to conclude exactly how he died. Tribute: The Stone Roses said they wanted to extend their 'sincerest condolences to Christopher's family and friends [...] at this incredibly sad time' (Left to right: John Squire, Mani, Ian Brown and Reni) Big atmosphere: Christopher had been at the band's reunion concert at Manchester's Heaton Park on June 29 . More than 120,000 people joined the 'Help Find Chris Brahney' Facebook page following his disappearance. And since his body was found, Stone Roses fans have launched an online campaign to propel the band’s anthem 'One Love' to the top of the UK singles chart. Anyone wanting to support the campaign is being urged to Tweet it with the #ChrisBrahneyOneLove Twitter hashtag. Missing: After an exhaustive search of the city, his body was found in the Manchester Ship Canal near Media City in Salford Quays on Monday . In a statement on the Stone Roses website, the band said: 'We'd like to extend our sincerest condolences to Christopher's family and friends. Our thoughts are with them at this incredibly sad time.

He could have been at Bowlee Park shortly before midnight. Further inquiries also revealed that he may have been seen outside the Maccabi Sports Centre on Bury Old Road at about 12.05am on Saturday June 30. Too similar: The plot revolved around troubled alcoholic Peter Barlow, played by Chris Gascoyne, who disappears before his father receives a call to say a body has been pulled from a canal . Officers now believe that Mr Brahney managed to get into Manchester city centre in the early hours of June 30 where he picked up shoes that he had bought earlier that day and hid in Rosenfields car park on Thorniley Brow near to Shudehill Metro link station. He also had sunglasses on his head.

As the strong winds blow across the vast sandy expanse, the future of the ancient fossils residing in a Peruvian desert are in jeopardy. Geologists have spent the past few years painstakingly exploring the vast whale cemetery which dates back millions of years, but today the biggest threat to the ancient find is a battle against the abrasive elements. The fossilised remains of roughly 15 of . the majestic marine mammals were discovered in the Ocucaje desert some 310 kilometers (190 miles) south of the capital Lima. Painstaking work: An archeologist brushes the fossilized jaw of a whale lying on the desert pavement of Ocucaje, 310 km south of Lima . Slice of history: The delicate remains of roughly 15 of the marine mammals are currently on view in the Ocucaje desert . Alive three to 20 million years ago, they were once submerged but are now situated some 30 kilometers from the shore. The area has been shaken by volcanic eruptions, killing off all life forms, according to experts from the country's geology and mining institute Ingemmet who have been working for four years at the site. 'The strong winds throughout the year in the area are the worst enemy of the fossils,' said Cesar Chacaltana, who heads the team during a tour of the site, which spans 45 square kilometers (17 square miles). Battling the elements: 'The strong winds throughout the year in the area are the worst enemy of the fossils,' said Cesar Chacaltana, who heads the team . Now, plans are underway to create a paleontological park that would include finds from this sandswept stretch, which Mr Chacaltana says could still contain an even larger treasure trove. 'There is probably a greater number of fossils in the sand but it takes high-tech equipment to locate and recover them,' he said. 'The bodies were preserved by the low level of oxygen in the substrate, which delayed decay caused by bacteria.' Excavation work so far has yielded some impressive results. In February, experts located the remains of a minke whale that is believed to be 3.6 million years old. Armed with brushes and chisels, and braving intense heat, they unearthed the animal's head -- spanning 1.8 meters -- that had fossilized on a rock. 'It is a species known only in Peru,' Mr Chacaltana said, estimating that the whale weighed about 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) and measured six meters in length. History uncovered: The fossilised spinal column of whale lie - today, wind is the main force removing the debris hiding these scientific treasures in what could be a paleontological park in the future . The specimen, protected so as not to damage it, is due to be transferred to the local municipality of Ocucaje, he added. Work would then continue on the rest of the remains. Mr Chacaltana recalled how in 2008 researchers found remains of a sperm whale (Livyatan melvillei) that were 12 million years old. The animal is believed to have been between 16 and 20 meters long. Preservation: A close up photo reveals the fossilised spinal column of whale . 'The . sperm whale is a prehistoric animal considered to be one of the largest . known marine predators that had about 70 teeth of 36 centimeters each . and fed on minke whales coming into the bay to mate,' he said. The . remains of the skull, jaw and teeth of the animal, which together . weighed more than a ton, are on display at the natural history museum at . the National University of San Marcos in Lima. A . decade ago, Mr Chacaltana came across the jaw and three-meter skull of a . giant shark, considered a mega predator, that lived off the Peruvian . coast. The fossilised remains of roughly 15 of the majestic marine mammals were discovered in the Ocucaje desert some 310 kilometers (190 miles) south of the capital Lima . While locals are being urged to tread . carefully while walking in the excavation area, plans to create a . paleontological park are taking shape. Ingemmet . head Susana Vilca said that the government agency is coordinating with . Ocucaje Mayor Paul Albites to develop a draft proposal to be presented . to Congress. In addition, she said, four experts were working on a geological map spanning 370 kilometers of the Ocucaje desert. It . would pinpoint, among other things, the location of the fossils and . areas where it is safe for the public to walk, according to Chacaltana.","Strong winds are 'worst enemy of the fossils' according to excavation team .

Sick: Moors murderer Ian Brady, pictured in 2001, may be well enough to appear before a mental health tribunal next week . Ian Brady is likely to be fit enough next week to appear in public for the first time in almost five decades, despite breaking two bones in his back. The Moors Murderer suffered a seizure on Monday while speaking to his lawyer about his bid to starve himself to death. The fall caused Brady, 74, who suffers a degenerative spine condition, to fracture two vertebrae. He was transferred from the secure Ashworth hospital in Maghull, Merseyside, to the University Hospital Aintree, six miles away. Brady spent two nights in a private room before being driven back to Ashworth yesterday. At a mental health tribunal next week, he is due to make his first public appearance since 1966 when he was convicted with Myra Hindley of murdering five children. Brady, who has been tube-fed since starting a hunger strike 12 years ago, wants to be declared sane and allowed to die in prison. Throughout his stay at the University . Hospital Aintree he was kept under guard in a private room with two . staff from Ashworth keeping watch along with officers from Merseyside . Police. Hospital staff told of seeing the killer being smuggled in covered by a blanket as armed police stood by. But there was anger that the . 74-year-old, who along with partner Myra Hindley murdered five children . in the 1960s, was getting treatment from the NHS at all. Katherine Reece, 41, who was admitted . to the same hospital with respiratory problems, said she had to wait . five hours for aid while medics swarmed around Brady. ‘He has chosen to live like that so . why should they look after him?’ she said. ‘The money they are spending . on him is disgraceful. ‘He should be left to rot.’ Treatment: Brady was taken to Aintree University Hospital, in Fazakerley, Liverpool where he was treated in a private room . Killers: Brady and his partner, Myra Hindley, were responsible for the murders of five youngsters in the 1960s . Katie Wilson, 20, who was visiting her . grandmother at the hospital, added: ‘He’s an evil man and he doesn’t . even want to be alive, so why should he get looked after here?’ Hospital staff are understood to have . used underground service tunnels to move Brady inside buildings so he . wouldn’t be seen by patients. One employee said: ‘I came face to face . with him and looked him in the eye – he looked really shrivelled, all . wrapped up in a blanket in a wheelchair.’ By a tragic irony, the mother of the . only victim of the Moors Murderers whose body has yet to be found is . herself seriously ill in hospital suffering from cancer. Winnie Johnson, who has campaigned for . Brady to reveal where he buried her 12-year-old son Keith Bennett’s . body, had hoped to come face to face with him at next week’s tribunal . hearing. But the 78-year-old has accepted that given her health, to do so would be ‘too traumatic’, her solicitor said yesterday. Guard: Police outside the Liverpool hospital where Brady was treated . Brady has been held at Ashworth secure . hospital in Maghull, Merseyside since 1985 from where next week’s . hearing was due to be relayed to a courtroom in Manchester by video. The Glasgow-born killer suffered a seizure on Monday afternoon while discussing his case with his solicitor, Richard Nicholas. He was taken by ambulance to . University Hospital Aintree and placed in a private room accompanied by . two Ashworth nurses with guards outside the door. Officially he was last night being kept in for tests as a precaution. Brady is known to be in poor health after more than a decade subsisting only on liquid nutrition. He suffers from a number of physical conditions and is thought to be on a respirator for breathing problems. His solicitor said Brady would be keen to return to Ashworth for the tribunal to go ahead. ‘He’s looking forward to it, but at this stage we just don’t know if it will go ahead next week,’ Mr Nicholas said. A spokesman for Ashworth said Brady had become ‘acutely physically unwell’ on the ward before being transferred to Aintree. Neither hospital would comment on . Brady’s condition but Jackie Powell, his mental health advocate, . described him as ‘quite unwell’. Top security: Ian Brady has been at Ashworth Hospital in Merseyside for the past 25 years and suffered a seizure on one of the wards on Monday. He is appealing for the right-to-die . Brady – a prolific letter-writer – did not report any health problems in a note he sent a few days to journalist Peter Gould. ‘There was nothing to indicate he was . experiencing health problems, other than a complaint about his . eyesight,’ he said last night. Brady and Hindley lured five children . from streets around Manchester in the Sixties, sexually tortured them . then buried their bodies on Saddleworth Moor. Pauline Reade, 16, and John Kilbride, . 12, were both snatched in 1963, with Keith Bennett and Lesley Ann . Downey, ten, killed the following year and 17-year-old Edward Evans in . 1965.

These shocking pictures show the horrific injuries to Euan Cusack’s neck after he rode straight into the six-foot long rope at 15 mph. Euan was on a bike ride with friends when he cycled straight into a taut rope tied by suspected pranksters on a footbridge in Treeharris, near Merthyr Tydfill, South Wales. Injuries: Euan, 12, suffered deep cuts and rope burns to his face and neck after the incident . He was left with deep cuts and rope burns on his face and neck - but miraculously, survived. His furious mum, Sandra, 44, said: 'As soon as I saw, and all the scars all over his face, I rushed him straight to the doctors, I couldn't believe my eyes. 'When walked into the doctor's surgery everybody stared at him. His injuries were awful. 'The doctor was so shocked when he saw Euan, he had no idea how he could have got such bad scars. Burns: The rope gashed Euan's face and neck when he rode into it at speed as he tried to cross a footbridge . 'He told me to take lots of pictures so we could try and catch the people that did it.'

Dinner time: Teresa Widener (right) and her daughter Kelsey Bayne, 22, enjoy very different treats at home in Bedford, Virginia. Miss Bayne tucks into some candyfloss while Mrs Widener's comfort food is stones . Odd diet: The mother-of-two hammers her stones down to an edible size. She eats stones to lift her spirits . On a bad day, Mrs Widener reaches for handfuls of pebbles and boulders she has stashed away in a special kitchen cupboard. Other Pica sufferers eat a anything from soap and sponges to lightbulbs, . She said:  'Over the last 20 years I've eaten on average 3lbs of rocks each week. It fluctuates depending on how I feel. 'If I feel down then I eat lots more because it comforts me. If I know I have some at my house I feel better, just knowing they're there. 'Like a comfort, they're there for me when I'm upset.' Mrs Widener selects . softer and more brittle rocks she knows she can break up easily while . out walking in the country. She . said: 'I pick the ones I like the look of.

'The teeth on that side have grown stronger,' she said, 'because I've been chewing rocks with them for so many years.' Love at work: Mrs Widener credits her new husband Jim with helping her cut down on her stone-eating habit . That's a good one! Mrs Widener selects which stones to eat during country walks . But a new man in her life is helping her cut down on her odd habit. Since marrying Jim Widener last August, Mrs Widener claims her stone consumption is on the decline. She said: 'Jim makes me so happy I've started eating less. But everyone has bad days and when I have one only rocks can make me feel better. 'He . was really shocked when he first found out I ate rocks, but he loves me . for who I am and know it helps me happy if I need a boost.' Mrs Widener's . cravings for boulders and pebbles is caused by medical condition Pica, . which sees sufferers obsessed with eating strange objects. It is thought uncontrollable urges in sufferers could stem from a dietary deficiency of certain minerals. Natural lift: Another delicious stone goes down a treat as Mrs Widener comforts herself . Some creatures in the animal kingdom, such as wolves and turtles, also eat rocks to help digestion. But it is a condition rarely seen in humans. Doctors think Mrs Widener's need for rocks could be caused by an iron deficiency which has led to her suffering anaemia. If the rocks she collects are too big, Mrs Widener breaks them into bite-sized pieces with a rock hammer. She said: 'I've never had any medical problems because of the rocks but I don't go to the toilet too often and my tummy hurts a little sometimes.' Pica is surprisingly common. Experts say as many as 21 per cent . of children aged one to six can suffer it at some stage. Pica . derives from the Latin for magpie - a bird with a reputation for eating . almost everything. It appeared in medical texts as far back as 1563 and . is believed to be common in pregnant women. The habit of eating non-edible objects could arise from some sort of deficiency. Some sufferers eat dirt, according to Dr Carol Cooper, and many of them are found to lack iron, which is present in soil. Others develop the condition because of extreme stress, though it is not clear why. A . desire to eat cleaning agents may be linked with obsessive-compulsive . disorder or just a liking for fragrances. Pica can lead to dangerous . complications in the body's metabolism.

Legend holds that tourists who toss a coin into Rome's Trevi Fountain can be assured of returning to the Eternal City. And figures published yesterday suggest that hotels in the Italian capital can expect plenty of bookings in the future - the value of small change recovered from the water is soaring. Despite the troubles gripping the European economy, it seems more people are willing to throw cash into the famous fountain. Coining it in: The value of small change tossed into Rome's Trevi Fountain is soaring . The rise is not solely due to tourists seeking good luck in difficult times, however. Authorities in Rome have also clamped down on thieves who steal coins from the water. The Roman Catholic charity Caritas, which fishes out coins once a week to pay for Aids shelters and food for the poor, has noticed a significant change. 'The increase is 20 to 30 per cent,' Alberto Colaiacomo, the charity's spokesman, told the Times. 'The rise is due to the fact that the Rome council passed a resolution making it a crime to take coins from the fountain. 'Before, there were gangs of thieves who managed to steal a lot. When they were stopped, we saw a lot more money.' Hollywood treatment: Anita Ekberg frolics in the fountain in the 1960 movie La Dolce Vita . The charity removed coins worth £652,500 in 2010, rising to £740,500 last year. This year, with the tourist season only just beginning, Caritas has already collected £420,000 - more than £2,300 a day. The fountain is a huge attraction for tourists and it has featured in several films, including the 1960 movie La Dolce Vita starring Anita Ekberg and Marcello Mastroianni. The tradition that a visitor who throws a coin into the fountain will return to Rome was at the centre of the 1954 Hollywood film Three Coins in the Fountain. The crackdown on thieves began after a television show used a hidden camera to record three men sweeping coins from the fountain with a broom in April last year. Lucky for some: Roman Catholic charity Caritas says the total value of coins recovered from the fountain has increased by up to 30 per cent .","Value of coins tossed in fountain has soared by up to 30 per cent, charity claims .

Guilty: William Belfour faces a mandatory life sentence after he was found guilty on all counts . Murderer: William Belfour was sentenced to three life terms follow his conviction in the Hudson family murders . The man convicted of gunning down the mother, brother and 7-year-old nephew of singer and Academy Award-winning actress Jennifer Hudson has been sentenced to three life terms in prison. The singer and actress attended every day of the trial, and the sentencing of William Balfour today was no exception. Balfour's defense filed an appeal shortly after he was convicted of first-degree murder in May, but it was denied. According to TMZ, Cook County Circuit Judge Charles Burns told Balfour: 'Your soul is as barren as dark space.' The sentencing came a little more than two months after a jury convicted Balfour in the October 24, 2008 shooting deaths of Hudson's 57-year-old mother Darnell Donerson, her 29-year-old brother Jason Hudson and her 7-year-old nephew Julian King. Some of the jurors spoke to the press . following their decision, saying that phone records were the tipping . point amid a sea of circumstantial evidence. The . evidence that helped seal Balfour’s fate was the testimony from a . forensic investigator who told the court how he triangulated Balfour’s . location using cell phone towers. ‘Once we were able to piece the timing together…we were able to put a timeline together,’ juror Paula Holcomb said, according to NBC Chicago. 'We realised that he could not be at two places at one time.' Victimised: Jennifer Hudson, pictured performing earlier this month, was present for the sentencing of William Balfour in Chicago . Crushed: Michelle Davis-Balfour, center, mother of William Balfour, hides her face from photographers after her son was found guilty of the three murders . Prosecutors portrayed Balfour as a jealous estranged husband who often stalked Julia Hudson's house after he moved out in early 2008. They said all his anger and jealousy erupted into violence shortly after he came into the house and spotted a gift of balloons there that were from Julia Hudson's new boyfriend. They told jurors that after Julia Hudson left the house for her job as a bus driver the morning of October 24, Balfour returned with a .45-caliber handgun and shot Hudson's mother in the back, and then shot Hudson's brother twice in the head as he lay in bed. Prosecutors said Balfour then drove . off in Jason Hudson's SUV with Julian - Julia's son, whom she called . Juice Box - and shot the boy several times in the head as he lay behind a . front seat. Opposites: Jennifer Hudson, right, holds her Academy Award while and convicted murderer William Balfour, is seen clutching a bottle of champagne . Weeping: A courtroom sketch shows Jennifer Hudson and sister Julia reacting to the closing arguments in the murder trial . The boy's body was found in the abandoned vehicle miles away after a three-day search. The case against Balfour was built largely on circumstantial evidence, with witnesses testifying that the shootings were the final chapter of a story that was laid out to them by Balfour himself in alleged threats that he would kill Julia Hudson's family if she spurned him. Julia Hudson was among those who testified about the alleged threats Balfour made against her family, telling jurors that he was so prone to jealousy that he even angrily complained when her young son kissed her. 'He said, `If you leave me, you will be the last to die. I'll kill your family first,' she testified. In memoriam: Jennifer Hudson, left, is seen pictured with her murdered mom, centre, and sister Julia. It is captioned: 'my lovely mother, beautiful sister julia and i' Victims: Jennifer Hudson's brother Jason Hudson, . left, and nephew Julian King, right, were also killed in the brutal . 2008 triple murder . Other witnesses told similar stories, with one saying that Balfour 'went on a rant' in August 2008 about his estranged wife in which he repeatedly threatened to kill the family. Another said he saw Balfour spying on his estranged wife from outside her house. A former girlfriend of Balfour testified that Balfour told her he had shot and killed Hudson's family members and that she'd agreed to serve as his alibi if police inquired out of fear he would harm her. Some of the most dramatic testimony came from Jennifer Hudson. The singer, who won an Academy Award for her role in the 2007 film 'Dreamgirls,' was the first witness to testify. 'I tried to keep my distance from William Balfour,' she told jurors when asked if she was ever friends with Balfour, whom she'd known since junior high school. But Balfour's attorneys suggested that someone else committed a crime in the family's three-story house in Englewood on Chicago's South Side. Utter tragedy: The body of Jennifer Hudson's missing nephew was found in the back of a white SUV, three days after he had vanished . The way they told it, someone other than Balfour targeted the family because of alleged crack-cocaine dealing by Hudson's brother. But when it came time to present evidence, Balfour's attorneys only called two witnesses in 30 minutes of testimony and never presented any evidence to support that theory. Even if the suggestion did not sway jurors, it did underscore the violence that plagues the family's small neighborhood on the city's South Side, a community where children grow up knowing the sound of gunfire, a sound so common that residents often don't even bother reporting it to cops. A high school dropout and member of a street gang, Balfour had a long rap sheet for drug offenses and automobile theft when he was arrested and convicted for attempted murder and vehicular hijacking. After seven years in prison he was released in 2006. A few months later he married Julia Hudson, at about the same time Jennifer Hudson was starring in 'Dreamgirls.' Balfour had a falling out with his wife and moved out of the house. Just months later he was back in jail, charged in the Hudson family slayings. House of horrors: Memorials were placed outside the home of Darnell Hudson Donerson; she was found shot to death in the living room, and her son Jason was gunned down in a bedroom .","William Balfour had been convicted of all counts - including murders of singer's mother, brother and 7-year-old nephew .

Britons are spending more time listening to their radios, but younger listeners are turning off in favour of the internet. Although over-35s continue to tune into their favourite shows, radio is falling out of favour with those in their teens and early 20s. A study by media regulator Ofcom found that last year Britons listened to an average 22.5 hours of radio each week – an increase of 24 minutes on 2010. Tuning in: A study by media regulator Ofcom found that last year Britons listened to an average 22.5 hours of radio each week ¿ an increase of 24 minutes on 2010 . However, the medium was less popular with younger people, with those aged 15 to 24 listening to only 17 hours a week – a fall of 22 per cent in ten years. Similarly 25 to 34-year-olds tuned in for only 19.3 hours last year compared with 22.7 in 2001. Ofcom said the reason was down to young people using music  sharing websites such as Spotify and Soundcloud, and the increase in MP3 music players, such as iPods, which can hold thousands of songs on one device. Radio accounted for 82 per cent of the time adults spent listening to audio material, compared with only 56 per cent for those in their late teens. The success of Radio 4 could also be part of the reason that older listeners are still tuning in, the research suggested. The station recorded listening figures of around 11million a week last year, while its flagship show the Today Programme, which is fronted by John Humphrys, almost overtook Chris Moyles’s Radio 1 Breakfast Show, aimed at listeners in their late teens.

Businessman George Pasparakis caught the culprit red-handed after fitting CCTV outside Wessex Industrial Doors in Yeovil, Somerset - following a number of raids on the company. Officers quickly tracked down the thief and he even admitted his actions - but police chiefs decided not to prosecute him, because he claimed taking scrap metal is legal in Poland. Target: George Pasparakis has been targetted six times by scrap metal thieves . Mr Pasparakis, 37, is 'gobsmacked' by the decision. He said: 'I’m not sure how bad a crime has to be where you can claim ignorance before they take action. 'We’re so frustrated at what we were told. I was gobsmacked and I think the police officer was too. 'He almost seemed embarrassed. Is Polish law operating in Yeovil?' The price of scrap metal has skyrocketed in recent years from £80 per skip to between £300 and £400 per skip. Mr Pasparakis had six skips emptied in the last few months and spent more than £500 on 24-hour CCTV surveillance system. The company has also spent hundreds . of pounds building a large retractable container to protect a skip . outside the premises used to store metal off-cuts. So when the CCTV picked up a good . shot of the Polish man and his vehicle in June they thought they would . be able to bring a successful prosecution against him.

The businessman was stunned when the police decided not to prosecute because the thief didn't know he had committed a crime . Mr Pasparakis said: 'The first time he took scrap metal he bought his little girl along. 'We watched on CCTV as she ran around looking bored as emptied the skip. It was dumbfounding.' But police decided it was not in the 'public interest' to charge the man, who has not been named. Sergeant Richard Downing said: 'We received two reports of theft from a skip. These incidents were fully investigated. 'A man was arrested and questioned. The man fully admitted the incidents and was unaware it was a crime. 'On consideration it was decided it was not of public interest to prosecute this man.'

Since Robert Kennedy filed for divorce two years ago, Mary Kennedy's battle against drug and alcohol addiction included an arrest for driving while intoxicated. An autopsy report showed she had antidepressants in her system when she died. In a court affidavit linked to their divorce, Robert Kennedy claimed his wife beat him, threatened suicide in front of her children, ran over the family dog and drank until she passed out. The Richardson family said his account was filled with lies. They lost a court fight to bury her at a location of their choosing. Mary Kennedy's relatives did not attend the funeral Robert Kennedy organized in Bedford, New York, the Westchester County town where they lived. After her burial, the Richardsons organized a private tribute to her in Manhattan. According to lawyers, RFK Jr. stopped covering his wife’s legal bills in the months before her suicide. Filed documents said that Mary owed as much as $300,000 in legal fees, so it is unclear how much her estate is worth. Court records also show how Mary’s credit was ‘severely restricted,’ and how the mother-of-four had restricted access to cash.","Conor Kennedy requesting to be named administrator on late mother's estate, having just turned 18 .

A woman once described as the Jackie Kennedy of China was yesterday charged with the murder of an Old Harrovian businessman. Chinese authorities accused Gu Kailai of poisoning Neil Heywood with cyanide after he threatened her son in a row over money. If convicted, she could face the death penalty. The charge marks a dramatic fall from grace for Mrs Gu, the daughter of a Mao-era revolutionary hero. Victim and suspect: Chinese prosecutors are charging Gu Kailai (right), the wife of a top Communist Party official, with the murder of British businessman Paul Heywood (left) Her husband Bo Xilai was one of China’s most powerful politicians until the scandal erupted earlier this year. She is expected to face a ‘show trial’ within weeks and the timing of yesterday’s announcement that she had . been charged prompted speculation that prosecutors could hold the case . during the Olympics in an attempt to reduce international interest. The state-run news agency Xinhua said Mrs Gu and a family aide, Zhang Xiaojun, were both charged with poisoning Mr Heywood. The Xinhua report added: ‘The facts of . the two defendants’ crime are clear, and the evidence is irrefutable . and substantial. Therefore, the defendants should be charged with . intentional homicide.’ Twist: Patrick Devillers (right - pictured with Gu) is reported to be assisting Chinese authorities with the investigation . Arrested: Devillers's home in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh . The arrest of Mrs Gu, 53, and the . suspension of her husband from China’s ruling Politburo was humiliating . for the country’s political elite, ahead of this year’s once-a-decade . leadership contest. Mr Heywood, 41, was found dead in a . hotel room in China last November. At first officials blamed the expat’s . death on excess alcohol, and his body was cremated without a post- . mortem examination. But in February Mr Bo’s former police . chief, Wang Lijun, told officials he believed the consultant was the . victim of poisoning, allegedly on the orders of Mrs Gu. Mr Heywood mentored the Chinese power . couple’s son, Bo Guagua, to secure a place at Harrow, the leading public . school in North-West London. Mr Heywood went on to work as a ‘fixer’ for Mr Bo, the Communist Party leader in the eastern city of Chongqing. Murky dealings: Mrs Gu with husband Bo Xilai, the purged Communist leader of Chongqinq, and their son Bo Guagua . Reports have claimed Mr Heywood helped . Mrs Gu to smuggle money out of China, and that she allegedly funnelled . up to £3.8billion to accounts in the names of relatives and friends . overseas. Commentators in China have questioned . whether she used some of the money to pay her playboy son’s fees at . Harrow, and subsequently at Oxford and Harvard universities. Mrs Gu, a former lawyer, faces a legal . system in which police, prosecutors and judges are all controlled by . the Communist Party. The country has a conviction rate of around 98 per . cent. Mr Heywood, who lived in Beijing with . his Chinese wife and two children, was summoned to Chongqing for a . meeting last November and was found dead a day later. State media said Mrs Gu and her son . had ‘conflicts with Mr Heywood over economic interests’ and that Mrs Gu . was worried about a ‘threat to her son’s personal security’. If convicted, Mrs Gu and her alleged . accomplice may face death by lethal injection although the death penalty . is sometimes commuted to a life sentence in high-profile cases. Mr Bo, 63, was removed as party . secretary in Chongqing in March and has been under house arrest since . then while he waits to learn the decision of a party investigation into . allegations of ‘serious discipline violations’.

The Cincinnati Bengals cheerleader charged with having sex with one of her 16-year-old students has spoken out for the first time since the accusations - and has admitted she is 'dying inside'. Sarah Jones, 27, is under house arrest after she was charged in Covington, Kentucky with sexual abuse for allegedly sleeping with a student at the high school where she taught English. But speaking on the Today show, Jones branded the claims 'rumours' and said that the alleged . victim and his family, who are friends with her own . family, will all testify in her defense in court. 'I'm taking it day by day,' she said of the charges. 'Sometimes I take it minute by minute.' Scroll down for video . Struggle: Sarah Jones, a former NFL cheerleader accused of having sex with one of her students, has spoken to the Today show to reveal her daily struggle dealing with the accusations . When asked how she was coping and if she . was 'dying inside,' she added: 'Yes, I am. I call my parents on a . regular basis and I say, ""What can I do just to get through just this . minute?""' Jones, a five-year veteran of the NFL's Ben-Gals cheerleading team, refused to discuss the details of the case, only saying the rumours were started by the alleged victim's bitter ex-girlfriend. 'Just because it’s a rumor, it can be very disruptive to a career,' she said. She admitted there were 9,000 pages of photos, Facebook messages and texts between her and the student, but it 'does not mean that every single page has something that is going to prove this case'. Jones is accused of having sex with a . 16-year-old football player at Dixie Heights High School, where she . taught English. She had resigned from the school in November citing . 'personal reasons'. Tough questions: Jones, who appeared on the show with her mother Cheryl and attorney Eric Deters, said there was no evidence she had sex with the teen boy . 'Torture': Jones, pictured with her mother Cheryl, said she looks at every article written about her . The indictment, filed in March, states . the alleged sexual relationship with the high school student took place . between October 1 and December 31. She pleaded not guilty in April. She also pleaded not guilty to . unlawful use of electronic means to induce a minor to engage in sexual . activities, a charge often reserved for people peddling child . pornography over the internet. Her mother Cheryl, 55, a middle . school principal who is now on administrative leave, faces a single . charge of tampering with evidence in her daughter's case. She also . pleaded not guilty. Sarah Jones told Today that the alleged victim and his family will testify in her defense. The family appeared in court earlier this year alongside Jones and her mother, even though they had been ordered to have no contact with the family. Accused: Jones was head cheerleader and five-year veteran of the NFL's Cincinnati Bengals . 'Rumours': She also taught high school English but quit last November for 'personal reasons' Case: The prosecution said it has 9,000 pages of photos and messages between Jones and her 'victim' Her attorney, Charles Lester Jr, told the Cincinnati Enquirer: 'The . families are friends.' The interview comes on the same day Jones's . attorney filed a motion to have the charges against her dropped, . claiming that prosecutors have failed to provide proof that a crime . occurred. 'The Commonwealth does not have ... a single witness that there was any sex,' lawyer Eric Deters wrote to the court, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported. 'There is not a single sealed text . message that would reflect there was sex in any state, much less . Kentucky. There is no confession. There is no admission. There is only . speculative conjecture.' In the interview, Jones added that she has only had sex with one man, her ex-husband, Nathan Wilburn. They married in July last year and separated just one month later. They are now divorced. She must wear an ankle bracelet and cannot leave the house. Arrests: Jones, left, was charged with sexual abuse and her mother Cheryl, right, has been charged with covering for her daughter by asking a witness to 'destroy' a phone allegedly containing evidence . 'I can't walk to the mailbox,' she said. 'If I go to the mailbox it starts beeping and that's a violation.' She said she spends her time studying for the LSAT, and has started working for her lawyer as a paralegal. She also scours the internet looking for stories about her. 'The biggest thing is when people attack my character without knowing the full story,' she said. Jones added that she knows the information about her on the internet will haunt her. 'I cant wait to get married and have kids . and start a life,' she said. 'The most devastating part is I can't imagine . [my children] getting on the internet and reading the comments about their mother like . that.' Jones also grabbed headlines in 2009 when photographs and postings uploaded on TheDirty.com branded her a 'slut' with 'two STDs'. In court: Jones appeared in court in April and pleaded not guilt to the charges. The family of the alleged victim was there to support her, even though she had been ordered not to contact them . Support: Jones, pictured with her mother, said the alleged victim and his family will testify in her defense . When she emailed the site to plead they take photographs down, more posts appeared claiming she had had sex with Bengals players. Appearing on ABC at the time, she said: 'To stand in front of 30 15-year-olds and tell them you don't have two STDs and that you are not a slut is the hardest thing you will ever have to do.' Ms Jones sued Nik Richie, TheDirty.com’s founder, for character defamation. She was awarded an $11million default judgement but the litigation is ongoing. The mother and daughter are scheduled to stand trial in October.

Out of exile: Former Polly Peck tycoon Asil Nadir (pictured) said he wanted to return to the UK to face trial for allegedly defrauding the company out of £150million because of a 'burning sense of injustice' A 'burning sense of injustice' persuaded fugitive tycoon Asil Nadir to voluntarily return to the UK after 17 years on the run, a court heard today. The 70-year-old former chairman and chief executive wanted a jury to hear he was 'not guilty' of stealing nearly £150million from his Polly Peck International (PPI) business empire, it was said. The £2billion company, which included households names such as Del Monte, Russell Hobbs kitchen appliances and Japanese hifi company Sansui, suddenly collapsed in 1990 with debts of £550million. It is alleged he had 'abused' his position of power to help himself to millions of pounds, siphoning off funds from some of the 200 PPI subsidiaries he owned to overseas companies and banks under his control. Nadir transferred the money to companies in Switzerland, the Bahamas and elsewhere before depositing it in a bank he owned in Northern Cyprus to bankroll himself, his family and associates between 1987 and 1990, it was claimed. But in September of that year the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) obtained a warrant to search PPI offices and the share prices plummeted. Within months, PPI had been placed into administration and while awaiting trial in the early 1990s, Nadir fled to his native Northern Cyprus in 1993. He only returned 18 months ago and has stood trial from the beginning of January of this year. After sitting for 123 days and hearing evidence from 94 witnesses, Nadir’s barrister Philip Hackett QC addressed the jury as he concluded his closing speech. He said: 'One day he’s got £400million of shares, the star of the City. His company is one of the stars of the City. He has got developments all over the world. 'But the next day all of it is doomed. Mr Nadir is full of rage about the fact that a warrant was obtained without investigation as to who owns those companies in Switzerland.' Facing justice: Nadir and his wife Nur arrive at the Old Bailey in London in January to stand trial on 13 counts of theft between 1987 and 1990 . In the dock: Nadir is accused of abusing his position of power to siphon off millions from Polly Peck, which he used to fund himself, his family and his associates . He said that if a proper investigation had been undertaken the SFO would have realised the companies in Switzerland and elsewhere were owned by PPI. Nadir had allegedly raised emergency loans from the Turkish Government, but PPI directors had been 'intimidated' into winding it up and 'it was too late and they would not change their mind.' The jury were told Nadir was arrested as he flew in with the Turkish offer, quizzed and then charged without what he claims was any investigation. Over the next couple of years, 60 other counts were added, Nadir was unable to travel to Northern Cyprus to get evidence, he was made bankrupt and could not hire lawyers. The jury were told all Nadir’s papers were seized after the bankruptcy as part of a civil claim and an injunction to intercept and open his post was obtained. Facing the media: Nadir arrives at his London home in August 2010 after 17 years on the run in northern Cyprus because he feared he would not get a fair trial . Back in the UK: The fugitive tycoon walks off a plane with his wife in August 2010 after returning from Cyprus . Then allegations of attempts to bribe the judge emerged with Nadir and his QC at the centre, 'although there was nothing to substantiate this.' Mr Hackett added Nadir 'cracked and left' because he feared he would not get a fair trial especially as the case controller Lorna Harris had lied to the Attorney General who then had inadvertently misled Parliament. It was only 18 months ago Nadir felt he could get a fair trial and would be granted bail - and 'as soon as he got that he came back.' He said: 'Perhaps the most important thing is that he came back. Why, in his 70s, living, you may think, at a very pleasant place where no-one can touch him, what would persuade a man that suffered these blows to return? 'He told you he wanted to come back. What persuaded a man who is 70 to offer himself up to be tried. On the run: Nadir at his home in nothern Cyprus in July 1993. Nadir 'cracked and left' the UK after allegations of attempts to bribe the judge in the original trial emerged . Relaxed: Nadir's barrister questioned in his closing remarks to the jury why Nadir would leave his Cypriot safe haven other than to protest his innocence . 'It’s the burning sense of injustice. Although he could have lived his life out in peace, he could not live with the sense of injustice. 'The only reason he came back is because he is not guilty and determined a jury should hear that and he should hear that from a jury.' In summing up the case, Mr Justice Holroyde said: 'The defendant admitted all the money left PPI and passed by various routes to end usage that did not benefit PPI in any way. 'The prosecution allege all these transfers were theft of PPI property. He dishonestly took what he knew to be PPI property and used it for his own benefit or benefit of his own family or associates. 'As a result of Nadir’s activities, PPI suffered a loss of around £150million. He denies he did anything dishonest and said PPI did not lose anything.' The jury were reminded Nadir claimed any transfers of funds from PPI's London bank accounts were 'preceded by deposits of the equivalent or greater sums in Turkish Lira' in northern Cyprus. 'The effect of that deposit of Turkish Lira by the time the transfers were made in London, the funds that were being transferred were no longer PPI property,' Mr Justice Holroyde said. Nadir was arguing there was a balance of payment. Nadir is charged with 13 'sample' counts of theft of £33.1million and $2.5million which date back to 1990. The court heard investigators found the total stolen in 64 identified transfers, including the 13 transfers which form the charges against him, amounted to £146,050,000 and $6,424,724. The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Asil Nadir, 70, wanted jury to hear he was 'not guilty' of defrauding business .

Jailed: Driver Alecia Brown crashed her Peugeot car and flipped it 8 feet into the air, instantly killing her friends Donna Morgan, 22, and Faye McKoy, 24 . A drunk single mother who killed her two best friends when she ploughed her car 90mph into a motorway gantry has been jailed for 22 months. Alecia Brown, 24, left two children orphaned when she lost control of her Peugeot and careered 8ft through the air before smashing into the huge steel frame on the M1 motorway. Her friends, young mum Donna Morgan, 22, and aspiring model Faye McKoy, 24, who was pregnant, were killed instantly in the crash last August. The friends had enjoyed a night out at . Groove nightclub in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, when Brown decided to . drive back to their homes in Northampton after drinking a strong . cocktail. Leicester Crown . Court heard that as well as being drunk, Brown was speeding and . uninsured when she tried to exit the M1 at Junction 15a at 90mph at 3am . on August 13, last year. Passengers Faye and Donna were not wearing seatbelts and were killed on impact. Brown was pulled alive from the mangled wreckage and suffered fractures to her pelvis, femur, spine and skull. Brown . pleaded guilty to two counts of causing death by dangerous driving and . was jailed for 22 months for each count to run concurrently. She was also disqualified from driving for five years. Judge Philip Head told Brown, who appeared in court on crutches: 'You only had a full licence for just six months. 'Two months before this you took out insurance which was on a dishonest and fraudulent basis, telling lies about yourself and driving record experience. 'It was described as a catastrophic error of judgement that you tried to execute that turn. 'But you were under the influence, travelling very high speeds over some considerable distance which was no error of judgement.' Fatal accident: After a night out, Faye McKoy, (left) who was pregnant, and Donna Morgan (right) were killed instantly in the horrific smash when Brown drove them both home . The court heard a back-calculated blood test found Brown, from Northampton, would have had 115mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood - far over the limit of 80mg. James Wing, prosecuting, said: 'As she got to the junction at a speed calculated at 90mph, she was on the verge of passing the slip road exit when at the last moment, she made what can only be described as a catastrophic error of judgement. 'She decided she was going to make the turn even though she was going far too fast and had far too little time. 'In attempting to make a turn far too drastic for the speed she was going, the car mounted the ramp, travelled through the air, going at about 8ft above the ground, and smashed directly into a steel gantry. 'Every part of the car was damaged.' After the case, Donna and Faye's mother's expressed outrage at the 'insultingly low' sentences. Elaine Morgan, who is now caring for Donna's 20-month old son, Du-Reece, said: 'I was under the impression a sentence was to both prevent re-offending and act as a deterrent. 'I feel neither purpose was served by this insultingly low sentence. 'By handing out only 22 months, the judge is saying Donna and Faye's lives were only worth 11 months apiece and the baby meant nothing, even though the judge stated that this was not simply an error of judgement. 'Needless to say I was devastated with the outcome.' Faye's mum Sarah York, who is now looking after three-year-old Krystelle, said she had been looking forward to becoming a grandparent again. She added: 'Almost 12 months have passed and now justice may seem to have been done, but my pain, my grief goes on for life. 'For someone to lose just a mere 22 months of their liberty for being the sole person responsible for taking three innocent lives beggars belief and yet they call it justice. 'But no amount of justice would ever be enough. For at the end of the day it doesn't change anything. 'It does not give me my daughter or grandchild back or Donna back to her family, and so we must go on, feeling empty, betrayed and forever trying to fill a void that can never be filled. 'I will always, with every beat of my heart, mourn the loss of my precious daughter, my best friend, my rock and the grandchild I never got to hold or cherish.'

Two binmen have been sacked after being caught on camera sleeping on the job - just a few hours into their shift. The pair were spotted catching 40 winks in their cab while out on their rounds in Aston, Birmingham, at 9.30am. The pictures, which were taken by a passing businessman visiting the area, show one Birmingham City Council worker slumped at the driver seat with his hefty boots on the dashboard. Caught on camera: The two binmen were spotted fast asleep at around 9.30am in the cab of their Birmingham City Council refuse lorry by a passerby . His co-worker is pictured in the . passenger seat, eyes tightly closed and with his head resting against . the back rest next to a half-open window. Now the sleepy pair, who were employed by an outside agency, have now been told their services are no longer required. The photographer said: ‘Is this really what council employees get up to so early in the morning?’ The photos were taken at 9.30 in the morning, just three and a half hours into the average binman’s shift. And the incident has caused added outrage because some local residents had been complaining their bins had gone uncollected. Council bosses took swift action after they were sent the pictures. They identified the two as employed by an outside agency, but refused to disclose which agency the men worked for. Sacked: Birmingham City Council took swift action after these photos emerged, telling the two binmen their services were no longer required . Robert Oxley, from campaign group Taxpayers’ Alliance, said the workers found napping on the job should ‘rightly face the sack’. He said: ‘Residents hand over their council tax so that their bins are emptied, not for staff to catch 40 winks in the cab. ‘The city council must demand value for taxpayers’ money and transparency when they outsource a service. ‘Firms . who fail to provide staff that are up to scratch should be consigned to . the rubbish heap just like the bins they were supposed to be . collecting.’ Two years ago . the council controversially moved from a task and finish system where . binmen could knock off if they completed their designated round early . to one where they work a full daily shift. But now it appears that instead of knocking early some staff prefer to take their downtime in the middle of their shift. Time wasters: The two binmen managed to fall asleep only a few hours into their shift at 9.30am . The pair also attracted criticism from one city councillor, who said members of the public were ‘paying the price for public sector cuts’. Waseem Zaffar, Labour councillor for the Lozells and East Handsworth Ward, said: ‘I’ve had calls from people in my ward to say their bins haven’t been collected, and even my own bins were collected a day late. ‘When you hear of people sleeping on the job, is makes you think is it any wonder we have a backlog. 'They may have been sleeping because they had a busy shift, which shows that having agency staff instead of permanent staff isn’t the answer.’ A Birmingham City Council spokesman said: ‘The people photographed were agency workers and we have told the agency that their services are no longer required. We have made a complaint to them about this.’","Passing businessman photographed the pair fast asleep in their Birmingham City Council truck at 9.30am .

The coach of the Canadian women’s soccer team stoked tensions with the U.S. squad just before their semifinal match today, taking a jab at the Americans for what he calls 'highly illegal' tactics. John Herdman accused Team USA of breaking the rules with their physical play on set pieces. Herdman said yesterday: 'One of the big threats we've got to take care of, and what we've paid attention to, is the illegal marking in the box on their corners and free kicks.' Dogfight: The U.S. team, in red and white stripes, are pictured in an exhibition match against Canada, in blue, last month. Today, they face off in the semi-finals of the London Olympics . 'Some of the blocking tactics, which are highly illegal, we'll keep an eye on them in the game. We've starting working on that in training without trying to injure our players.' Herdman said he also hopes to 'raise awareness' of the issue with game officials when Canada plays the U.S. in the semifinals today at Old Trafford. 'Obviously they're trying to free up a key player, but in a very illegal way... The U.S., it's what they do well,' he said. Herdman cited an example from the Americans' victory over France in the Olympic opener, when forward Abby Wambach headed in a corner kick in the first half. Battle: Canadian coach John Herdsman, left, launched accusations against Team USA, led by coach Pia Sundhage, right, over alleged violent tactics . Few successes: Canada is winless in its last 26 matches against its rivals to the south, going 0-22-4 since a win at the Algarve Cup in 2001 . He said U.S. defender Amy LePeilbet 'took a good battering' while making a move that freed up Wambach. Canada is winless in its last 26 matches against its rivals to the south, going 0-22-4 since a win at the Algarve Cup in 2001. The all-time series tilts 43-3-5 in favour of the Americans. Nonetheless, the U.S. will not be taking its previous successes for granted. Overconfident? Though Team USA has dominated Canada in the past, coach Pia Sundhage says she will not be taking their previous successes for granted . Team USA’s head coach Pia Sundhage told the San Jose Mercury News:  'The fact that [the U.S.] has been so successful means we are able to cope with the pressure and expectation and use it in a positive way.' Wambach added: 'Canada has always been a dogfight for some reason. 'We've had historically close matches . and because of the physical nature of the play, the result has often . been a lot closer than we would have liked.' The U.S. has won the last two Olympic gold medals, while a win today would guarantee Canada's first Summer Games medal in a traditional team sport - not counting rowing or equestrian - since a men's basketball silver in 1936. Herdman said: 'The Olympics is all about people trying to set personal bests and breaking world records, and I think for this group of players, that's what they're dreaming about.' 'I think the Olympics is one of those special occasions where things do happen, especially in these tournament formats... This is what we're trying to say, you know: 'Dare to dream.' You've got to be able to get out there and see something, see a bigger vision than normal people can see.' It's not the first time the U.S. has been accused of playing dirty during the London games. Colombian soccer player Lady Andrade, who was suspended after 'sucker punching' Wambach, said that it was the Americans who struck first. 'The whistle always goes in their favor,' she insisted. 'They were hitting us and hitting us, but there was never a whistle.'

Manpreet Kaur, 19, was arrested along with five contract killers, after the family's servant was murdered in a bungled attempt to assassinate her parents and brother while they slept in their house in Kanjhla, India. The teenager allegedly wanted her family dead after they disapproved of her relationship with Gurmeet Singh, a married man from the Ramdasia sect. Her family snubbed her for wanting to marry him.

Harcharan Singh Bhullar from Sangur police said: ‘Manpreet was furious over her family's decision and decided to eliminate her mother, father and brother.’ When Miss Kaur’s family found out about her relationship with Mr Singh, they took her out of school and he was refused entry into her village. Devastated and angry, Miss Kaur allegedly contacted her family’s former domestic servant Ramu to find contract killers to murder her family, according to the Hinustan Times. Miss Kaur employed five assassins, promising to pay them 500,000 Rupees (£5,787), to murder her family but the group failed on three occasions.

Hillary Clinton is taking time out of her busy international schedule during her last few months as Secretary of State to make her presence known, on the dance floor that is. Mrs Clinton's latest dance outburst occurred on Tuesday during a dinner in Pretoria, South Africa. The former first lady has been showing her lighter side in recent months, and first unveiled her smooth moves during a trip to a Colombian nightclub during an international summit in Cartagena this April. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Letting loose: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton showed off some of her trademark dance moves while at a dinner during an international visit to South Africa on Tuesday . Good fun: South African jazz singer Judith Sephuma (left) pulled Mrs Clinton into the center of the dance circle . Enthusiastic: The former first lady has been showing off her lighter side in recent months as she prepares to end her term, having said that she will not continue on if President Obama is re-elected . Considering that trip was marred by the unravelling of the Secret Service prostitution scandal, Mrs Clinton's night out was seen as a fun way for the ever-busy diplomat to relax with her staff. Unlike the Latin grooves of her April dance floor appearance, Mrs Clinton was swayed by the sounds of South African jazz singer Judith Sephuma at Tuesday night's dinner. Video shows that Mrs Clinton was the first one to get on the dance floor at the event, and it quickly filled after her lead. After beginning with some non-threatening shoulder-shuffling and hip shaking, the singer eventually singled the Secretary out and the two began to jokingly wiggling next to one another. Scene stealer: Clinton looks on as under secretary Bob Hormats briefly becomes the star of the show . Connecting through rhythm: Clinton links hands with African Union Chair-Designate Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. The last time Mrs Clinton was seen dancing was during a trip to Colombia . Empowered: Earlier in the day, Clinton appeared with Nkoana-Mashabane (right) and said that American efforts in South Africa have helped save hundreds of thousands of lives . Even though the singer was a bit more wild on the fashion front with an animal print dress, Mrs Clinton didn't shy away from the spotlight with her wardrobe selection either, opting for an electric blue evening jacket and her hair pulled back in a tight ponytail. With her wide smile and continued presence at the center of the action, it was clear that Mrs Clinton had fun at the event. Not to be deceived by the implication that the trip was largely social, she kept a tight schedule throughout the day. Showing 'em how it's done: Clinton boogies with her South African counterpart, foreign minister Maite Nkoanna-Mashabane (left) during the Tuesday event . Not a dance move: Even when they were off the dance floor during their meetings earlier on Tuesday, Nkoana-Mashabane and Clinton appeared to be in sync . Her trip to South Africa- the country . with the highest rate of HIV infection- came nearly two weeks after she . spoke at the International AIDS Conference in Washington, D.C. She met with foreign minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane and the pair hosted a joint press conference where Mrs Clinton said that through the various American-sponsored relief programs, they have been able to save 'hundreds of thousands of lives' in the country. They also attended a business summit where economic incentives were analysed for possible ways to expand growth in the region. In keeping with the friendly nature of the visit, Mrs Clinton paid a visit to former South African president Nelson Mandela. Old friends: On Monday, Clinton met with former South African President Nelson Mandela. The two have known eachother since the 1990s when Bill Clinton and Mandela were presidents at the same time . Though the 94-year-old leader is in ailing health and has seen only a handful of visitors outside of direct relatives in recent years, he appeared happy throughout the visit on Monday. Mrs Clinton commented on his 'beautiful smile'. Mr Mandela and the Clintons have a long-standing relationship, as he was president at the same time as Mrs Clinton's husband, former President Bill. In spite of her surge in popularity across both sides of the political aisle in recent months, Mrs Clinton has repeatedly declared that she will be resigning and not serving as Secretary if President Obama is re-elected for a second term. Though many have speculated that she is lining up for a second presidential run in 2016, she has denied as much publicly and said that the busy schedule has left her in need of a break.

The cost of a cuppa is set to rise by 15 per cent after the international price of tea surged to its highest level in two and a half years. The wholesale price of the highest quality black tea – known as broken pekoe 1 or BP1 – has leapt by 41 per cent since the beginning of the year to above 4 dollars a kilo. The increase follows a fall in the crop produced in Kenya, which is the world’s largest exporter of black tea, because of adverse weather conditions. Britain is a nation of tea lovers and is one of the biggest importers of tea . Production has been hit by a drought at the beginning of the year and some heavy frosts. A severe monsoon season has also reduced production prospects in India and Sri Lanka, two other major exporters. Kenya’s annual production this year is expected to fall to 360million kilos, which would be down by 17million on 2011. The 41 per cent rise in wholesale . prices could feed through to an increase of around 15 per cent at . supermarket check-outs in the UK. That would put up the price of a pack of 80 teabags from around £2.55 to around £2.95 ahead of this winter. The price of tea has risen to a two and half year high .

As George Osborne's austerity cuts continue to hit many Britons it appears his own parents are not feeling the pinch quite yet. The Chancellor's mother and father have bought a new £10 million house in West London, but they have done it without selling their own £15million luxury home just a few doors down. In order to downsize, 17th Baronet Sir Peter Osborne and Lady Felicity have put their current six-bedroom home on the market but will not sell until the housing market improves. Downsizing: Sir Peter Osborne and his wife Lady Felicity have bought a new house for £10 million just a few doors up from their current house in Notting Hill . In the meantime they have still managed to find another £10million to buy a five-bedroom property on the same street. Their new Victorian semi was owned by Robert Gillespie, director-general of the Takeover Panel, the city regulator that oversees corporate mergers, the Sunday Times said. And as part of the deal Mr Gillespie, who bought the house in 1994, can stay there until next year. 'They bought our house, but are still living down the road until March, when they'll move in here,' his daughter Imogen Gillespie told the Sunday Times. It appears their current house will stay on the market, and is listed online along with a dozen dazzling pictures. Current home: The Osbornes have put their house up for sale at a reported £15million but are waiting for the market to improve . Future home: They have bought this property in the same street but will not move in until next year . Only up the road: The Osbornes won't have far to go when they do start to move next year . Sir Peter's lavish spending could embarrass his son George, who has claimed 'we're all in this together' as he has pushed through public sector pay freezes and cuts in government spending. Earlier this year Osborne Jr also faced questions over his father's spending habits as he cut the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p, with Sir Peter giving an interview to the upmarket consumer magazine How To Spend It. In the interview, the 69-year-old baronet said he had his eye on a £19,000 Italian writing desk and spoke of his love of bespoke Savile Row suits. Father and son: Sir Peter Osborne and his son George Osborne. Sir Peter's spending appears to contrast with the Chancellor's austerity cuts . He also crowed about his 'unforgettable' holidays abroad on the exclusive Caribbean island of Mustique, a millionaires' playground where royals and tycoons spend their time. Land Registry records show the Osbornes bought their current home in 2006. They have since modified it by knocking through the semi's outside wall and filling the gap with the house next door to make it terraced. Now though, with their sons George, 41, Benedict, 39, Adam, 36, and Theo, 27, having left home, the Osbornes have no need for such a large house. With 4,600sq/ft of living space, the property, which dates back to the 1850s is being marketed by Estate Agent Savills as a 'unique property' with 'magical west-facing views'. Exclusive: This picture shows the rear of the home of George Osborne's parents, Sir Peter and Lady Felicity Osborne, which has gone on the market for a reported £15million . Plenty of space for family living: This picture shows a drawing room of the multimillion pound home, which boasts six bedrooms - nearly all with en-suite bathrooms . Well appointed: The Osbornes have bought another property on the same road for an estimated £10million, but will remain in the house until March next year . It boasts both private and communal . gardens, six bedrooms, nearly as many bathrooms, staff quarters and . off-road parking. However, it has yet to sell. That . might be something do with its massive asking price. A property source . told the Sunday Times that the Osbornes are asking for 'around . £15million' for their West London des res - nearly three times as much . as the average £4million asking price for homes on the same street. A property valuation website estimates the value of their new home at around £10million. The Osborne family's title dates back to 17th-century Ireland, when ancestor Richard Osborne was handed Ballentaylor in the County of Tipperary, and Ballylemon in the county of Wexford by the English throne. Chef's dream: The house has a state of the art luxury kitchen but also comes complete with staff accommodation . Space for entertaining: The kitchen opens out to this delightful rear-facing dining room with views of the garden . George Osborne - who was born Gideon before changing his name at 13 - is the heir apparent to the title. The family's current wealth comes from their upmarket wallpaper and fabric firm Osborne & Little, which Sir Peter co-founded with his brother-in-law Anthony Little in 1968. The company, which had a turnover last year of £32.8million, has showrooms in Paris, Munich, Milan and on the King's Road in West London. It once fitted out the White House apartments for Bill and Hillary Clinton.",The properties are in the same street in West London but Sir Peter Osborne and Lady Felicity will not move until next year .

Pensioner, Ian Kelsey stole more than £750,000 from his employer to splash out on flash cars, jewellery and holidays . A finance director who stole more than £750,000 from his employer to fund a lavish lifestyle including £10,000 holidays has been jailed for four years. Ian Kelsey siphoned off an average of £100,000 a year, over seven years, from the accounts of AM Todd, an American oil supplier. He took up to £48,000 in a single transaction after discovering he had final authority over all payments. The disgraced employee, from Wells, Somerset, used the cash to fund a 'high standard of living' including expensive holidays, jewellery for his wife and a fleet of new cars. Kelsey was jailed at Taunton Crown Court after admitting 24 charges of transfer by deception and fraud. Mr Recorder Paul Dunkels QC said the fraud was particularly grave given the degree of trust that had been placed in role as financial director. The judge said: 'You were responsible for arranging payment and the reclaiming of VAT and in the course of this duty you discovered that you alone could sanction payment. 'You embarked upon a course of repeated theft and fraud. 'This was a very grave breach of trust having regard to the degree of trust placed in you and the number of long years you did it for. 'I have of course given you credit for being a man of previous good character but here you are at the age of 67 having lost that and facing imprisonment for the first time in your life. 'I sentence you to four years imprisonment, you will serve half and be on license for the remainder.' Kelsey used the money to fund a lavish lifestyle of expensive holidays to Cyprus, jewellery and Mazda cars . He added that on average Kelsey stole over £100,000 a year to fund his lavish lifestyle and that there was no realistic prospect of the total £776,538.41 being repaid. Kelsey first began to steal from AM Todd, based in Frome, Somerset, in 2003 after he started transferring highly-inflated VAT re-claims into his Halifax bank account. Nigel Askham, prosecuting, told the court that suspicion had been cast after an HMRC official began to notice discrepancies in the claims between December 19th 2003 and February 23rd 2010. Ian Kelsey was jailed for 4 years at Taunton Crown Court . He said: 'When the official tried to arrange a visit to inspect the business Mr Kelsey was less than helpful. 'When they finally caught up it was obvious he was in complete panic, he was red faced and at one point he even ran off. 'It was discovered that he was transferring inflated VAT re-claims from the HMRC to A M Todd’s Sterling account into his own bank account. 'He funded his high standard of living, taking £10,000 holidays to Cyprus and buying many Mazda cars, over the years.' Rebecca Bradbury, mitigating, said that Kelsey had begun transferring the large sums of money after his hours and wages had been cut. She said that he had initially only transferred a small amount but on realising there was no second authority checking the transactions he took advantage and increased the amounts. He used the money to buy jewellery for his now ex-wife, who has been forced to hand back much of it during civil proceedings to reclaim the money. Miss Bradbury added: 'Once he had begun to buy his family nice things his family fell into this expectation and he didn’t wish to disappoint anyone. 'He didn’t think through the consequences, once he found he could make these transactions all thought left him and he couldn’t explain where the money had gone.' She added that he was genuinely sorry for what he had done and showed deep remorse and regret. The pensioner remained emotionless as he was led from the court room to the cells.","Ian Kelsey, 67, jailed for four years after admitting 24 charges of transfer by deception and fraud .

A former dancer who managed a successful strip club in the shadow of Windsor Castle was unfairly dismissed, an employment tribunal has ruled. Annmarie Harris, 37, was the manager of the Pink Gentleman's Club and its nearby sister bar Vanilla, which recorded combined takings of £120,000 during last year's Royal Ascot race meeting. But she was suddenly fired in January by her former partner, the venues' director Franco Lumba, who alleged that she had hit him with a diary. Successful: Annmarie Harris (centre) was awarded compensation after a tribunal ruled she was unfairly dismissed from her job running two nightspots near Windsor Castle. The two men in the picture were not involved in the case . Ms Harris, a former stripper herself, challenged the decision by taking her employer, FT Trading, to a tribunal where a panel awarded her £26,000 in compensation. Mr Lumba claimed that Ms Harris had been sacked for misconduct because she had assaulted him by striking him over the head with a diary. But she insisted that the incident happened almost five months after she had been dismissed from her role at the nightspots in Windsor, Berkshire. She said: 'He just wanted me out of the picture. 'I never assaulted him. The only time I can think of any sort of incident was on May 11. It was my birthday. Unfairly dismissed: Annmarie Harris (left) was sacked in January this year. The two men in the picture were not involved in the case . Claims: Annmarie Harris (third from right) insisted that she only hit her former partner with a diary after she had been fired. None of the other people in this picture was involved in the case . 'I drove to his car showroom. He was being rude so I picked up a diary from a desk and hit him around the head with it.' Ms Harris, of Ascot, Berkshire, and Mr Lumba, 44, of Twickenham, south-west London, were in a relationship while she worked at the venues and they have a 17-month-old daughter. Neither Mr Lumba nor his legal representatives were present at the tribunal hearing. Judge Jessica Hill, who headed the tribunal panel, told Ms Harris: 'We find that you were dismissed unfairly and there was no obvious reason for the dismissal.' The panel ruled that Ms Harris was owed unpaid wages and holiday pay and FT Trading had failed to issue her with written terms and conditions of her employment. Business: Ms Harris managed the Pink Gentlemen's Club, a strip club near Windsor Castle . Workplace: Ms Harris also ran the Vanilla Bar in Windsor before she was dismissed in January this year . Ms Harris was awarded £17,770 for . loss of earnings, £800 as a basic rate for being dismissed after two . years of employment and £2,000 in unpaid wages and lieu time. She . was also given £4,680 for 23 days of holiday pay, £350 pounds in . statutory rights and £800 for not being served with any written terms . and conditions. She worked at the venues from March 31, 2009 until January 16, 2012.

A protest has been held in the Lebanese capital Beirut against the use of anal tests on men suspected of homosexuality. Crowds gathered outside the law courts in the city to show their anger at the increasing use of the examinations, which are a criminal offence in the Arab country. Saturday's rally followed a police raid on a gay venue in a working class district of Beirut on July 28. Lebanese demonstrators hold signs against anal 'tests' on men suspected of homosexuality and so-called 'virginity tests' for women during a protest in Beirut . Thirty six men were taken into custody and forced to undergo the tests, reportedly to determine their sexual orientation. Lebanon-based HELEM, considered the Arab world's leading lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights group, called for the rally under the slogan: 'Stand up against the tests of shame, vaginal or anal.' It also voiced solidarity with women subjected to so-called 'virginity tests'. Protester George Azzi said: 'We’re here because we want a clear statement from the ministry of justice that these kind of tests should be completely abolished and punished by the law. Dozens of people demonstrated outside the law courts in the Lebanese capital to protest the use of anal 'tests' on men suspected of homosexuality . The protest also voiced solidarity with women subjected to so-called 'virginity tests' Lebanon-based HELEM, considered the Arab world's leading lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights group, organised the rally . 'The syndicate of doctors has declared these tests are irrelevant scientifically and it’s illegal for doctors to do these tests, but that doesn't mean police can't still request it,' he said. Men and women - ranging from gay and lesbian young adults to a father and daughter - chanted in unison and held banners that read: 'United to abolish the tests of shame.' Other homemade signs struck a more sarcastic tone: 'Honorable minister, before you test my anus, at least take me out to dinner,' read one. But for most, the tests were no laughing matter. One sign read: 'The cost of forensic rape: 125,000 Lebanese lira' (about $85), pointing out that the men subjected to the anal probes were being charged for the procedure. Under Article 534 of the Lebanese Penal Code, sexual relations 'contradicting the laws of nature' are illegal and violators may be punished by up to one year in prison.","Crowds gathered outside law courts in Lebanon to show their anger .

Millionairess Carole Waugh was stabbed to death on the same day she last spoke to her family, a court heard today. Ms Waugh, 50, suffered a fatal single stab wound in April but her body was only found four months later in a lock-up garage in south west London, magistrates were told. Her body was so badly decomposed she could only be identified by her dental records. Magistrates heard how Miss Waugh was last seen in mid-April when she spent the weekend . with her family back in Durham. She last spoke to them on April 16th on . her arrival home in London and just hours later was stabbed, according to prosecutors. Murdered: Oil executive Carol Waugh's body was found with a single stab wound inside a car at a garage in London, on August 2. She was stabbed to death on the same day that she last spoke to her family . Rakesh Bhayani, . 40, and Nicholas Kutner, 47, appeared at Croydon Magistrates Court today . charged with Ms Waugh’s murder. The pair, who appeared via videolink from Wandsworth Prison in south London, sat apparently emotionless during the five minute hearing as they were told they were charged with the murder of the businesswoman between April 15th and 19th this year. Bhayani and Kutner have already been charged with fraud offences linked to her disappearance, and Kutner allegedly pretended to be her brother so he could sell her flat. Grim find: Police tracked Miss Waugh down to a lock-up garage in New Malden (pictured) on August 2 . Miss Waugh, originally from Durham but . who was living in Marylebone, central London, when she was last heard . from, had not been seen for almost four months when her body was . discovered in the boot of a VW Golf car in a garage in New Malden. Marsha . Elias, prosecuting, told Croydon Magistrates Court: 'It is alleged that . between the evening of April 16 and the 17th the victim of our case . Carole Waugh received a single stab wound. She was later discovered by . police on August 2nd.' Miss Waugh, who had worked in the oil industry in Libya, was reported missing on May 7 and police launched an investigation after finding her bank accounts had been plundered of hundreds of thousands of pounds. Personal possessions, including Cartier jewellery, are still missing. Her body was discovered on August 2 in the boot of a VW Golf at a garage in Lime Court, New Malden, a day after Kutner was arrested at Luton Airport as he returned from a holiday in Majorca. Hidden in the boot: Her body was found in the boot of this blue VW Golf . Officers have been probing whether Ms Waugh had led a double life as an escort with men she had met through a variety of dating sites whilst pretending to be a successful businesswoman. Ms Waugh worked for eight years as a secretary for an oil company in Libya and claimed to own a flat behind Harrods and had a top-of-the-range Harley Davidson motorbike, despite her modest £25,000 salary. Kutner, of no fixed abode, is also charged with four counts of conspiracy to commit fraud. He is accused of pretending to be Chris Waugh, Ms Waugh’s brother, in a bid to sell her £650,000 two bedroom flat in Marylebone, central London. Missing: Ms Waugh was reported missing from her home in west London (pictured) in May this year . He also faces two charges relating to trying to renting her property at Tressard Court to two separate people - for which he was handed £10,000 - and a fourth of unlawfully withdrawing funds from the 50-year-old’s bank account. Unemployed Bhayani, of Wembley, north west London, has already appeared in court on three charges of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation relating to transactions associated with Ms Waugh’s identity worth around £280,000. So far 11 people have been arrested in connection with the case and it is believed that at least three women have attempted to pose as her. District Judge Tan Ikram said: 'I will send this case to the Central Criminal Court, the matter will be listed for an initial bail application on August 20th.' They are expected to enter pleas in November.

Criticism: Douglas Wilder, who was the first black governor in the U.S., said he felt the vice-president's 'chains' comment made a joke of slavery . America’s first black governor has become the most senior Democrat to break ranks over Joe Biden’s ‘y’all in chains’ comments, telling the Vice President: ‘Slavery is nothing to joke about.’ Douglas Wilder, who was governor of Virginia from 1990 to 1994, told CNN that ‘without question’ Biden’s remarks in Danville, Virginia ‘were appeals to race’. He continued: ‘The important thing I got out of this was Biden separated himself from what he accused the people of doing. As a matter of fact, what he said is they are going to do something to y’all, not to me. Not us. So he was still involved with that separate American. “As far as I am concerned, the President would not associate himself with those remarks. And I expect as the days go forward there will be more clarity associated with what the president feels about what Joe Biden said.’ In another interview with Fox News, the Democrat said: ‘Slavery is nothing to joke about. And the history of this nation’s involvement with slavery is nothing to pass off in a joke.’ Suggesting that Biden was a liability to Obama, he added that ‘you can’t continue to make gaffe after gaffe after gaffe and believe that it’s going to be supportive of what you and the president are both trying to do’. Wilder said on CNN that it had long been his view that Obama, as suggested by Sarah Palin on Tuesday, should dump Biden and adopt Hillary Clinton as his vice-presidential running mate. ‘If Hillary were on that ticket today based on the job she’s done as secretary of state, I think that would be a clearer advantage the president would be seeing. ‘It’s not going to happen. It’s too late. I think she’ll be getting herself together for 2016. But that doesn’t help the president today. What the president need to do it disassociate himself from trying to show anybody that division is what this administration is about as some may have said, “cool it, back up”.’ Gaffe-prone: VP Joe Biden told an audience made up of several hundred black supporters that Mitt Romney would put 'y'all back in chains' with his Wall Street financial deregulation plans earlier this week . Artur Davis, a black former congressman who was one of President Barack Obama’s most prominent supporters in 2008, told CNN that Biden was employing ‘a divisive tactic that’s insulting to African Americans’. The comments, he charged, were a deliberate racial tactic. ‘I know what Joe Biden was doing. Every black person in that room knew who the 'y'all' was. They knew what the chains were. They knew what the metaphor was about.’ So far, Obama has stuck by Biden, though he was visibly uncomfortable when asked about the remarks by People magazine and Entertainment Tonight during what were planned to be softball interviews. The President told People that Biden . wanted to say that consumers would be worse off if Republicans succeeded . in doing away with new restraints on financial institutions.

Mrs Giuliano, then 46, launched her own investigation into juror Jason Allo, then 31, donning short shorts and a recording device and spending hours recording their conversations, resulting in what she thought was explosive testimony, sure to earn John Giuca a mistrial. However, the Brooklyn District Attorney did not believe her, saying that Giuca did in fact order 19-year-old Mark Fisher to be gunned down in cold blood to raise the profile of his 'Ghetto Mafia' gang and that all her efforts worked against her, saying every bit of evidence she uncovered was tainted and she was nothing more than a vigilante. Undeterred, she's now demanding that the New York State Governor look at her son's case, as well as her own, and offer him a retrial. Scroll down for video . Mistrial? Doreen Giuliano, then 46, right, launched her own investigation into juror Jason Allo, then 31, left, donning short shorts and a recording device, spending hours recording their conversations . Conviction: The Brooklyn District Attorney did not believe her, saying that her son John Giuca, right, did in fact order 19-year-old Mark Fisher, left, to be gunned down to raise the profile of his 'Ghetto Mafia' gang . In October of 2003, Mark Fisher, 19, a football star from New Jersey, was gunned down in Prospect Park South after a night of bar-hopping. Found wrapped in a blanket on the street, he was shot five times in the face and chest. Police accused John Giuca of ordering Mr Fisher's death, saying that he told Antonio Russo to shoot him in order to get street cred for their 'Ghetto Mafia' gang. In 2005, they were convicted of murder and sentenced to 25 years to life for what was called the 'grid kid' slaying. But that's when Mrs Giuliano went from the weeping mother at her son's trial to a buxom Brooklyn blonde. Changing her name from Doreen to Dee, Mrs Giuliano began her quest to prove that Jason Allo, a Bensonhurst contractor, was not only a dishonest juror, but one that sought out to convict her son of the heinous crime because of a personal vendetta. More than just dying her hair, 'Dee' rented an apartment near Mr Allo's home, joined a gym, got a new cell phone number and assumed a new identity. She rode her bicycle around and around the block hoping to gain his attention - and she did. 'Every time I went to his neighborhood I would have to wear makeup, have my hair done, wear fake eyelashes,' she told ABC. 'I was prepared to do anything within the law.' For more than a year, Dee plied Mr Allo with wine and weed, discussing the trial and all the reasons, she says, he should never have been on the case. Transformation: More than just dying her hair, Mrs Giuliano, left, became 'Dee', right, renting an apartment near Mr Allo's home, joining a gym, changing her number and assuming a new identity . 'They tried to make him out to be like the Tony Soprano, but he was a f***ing clown,' Mr Allo said in the recordings. 'He's a tall, skinny Jewish kid with glasses.' He later told her, 'I hate Jews.' Prejudice aside, the most damning evidence Mrs Giuliano obtained was that Mr Allo knew several of the witnesses - even her son - and disliked them. 'I shouldn't have even been in that jury.'Jason Allo . 'Technically, by law, if I knew that s*** I shouldn't have even been in that jury,' he said on the tape. 'By law, you're not supposed to be. Because they ask you in the beginning when you go to jury duty if … they read you a list of all the witnesses.' Her sting operation was not without its difficulties. Her husband, Frank, would stay up until late when she returned from her sessions with Mr Allo. 'Even when I was home, I wasn’t home,' she told the New York Post. 'Husbands are always second when you have kids. So when you say you’d do anything for your kid, you mean it. If I’m gonna lose Frank over my son, so be it. You could always get another husband.' Home: For more than a year, 'Dee' plied Mr Allo with wine and weed, discussing the trial and all the reasons, she says, he should never have been on the case. Her faux apartment is pictured . In 2010, she filed an appeal with her attorney, alleging juror misconduct and demanded that her son be re-tried. '[T]he defendant’s motion reveals extraordinary misconduct,' the judge's ruling read, 'not by a juror, but by the woman who generated the motion — the defendant’s mother.' The judge ruled that the tapes of evidence were 'selectively recorded' and there was no way of knowing whether they had been manipulated. Her allegations fell on deaf ears, the judge saying that her own deceits made her an unreliable source, not to mention her obvious bias. Mrs Giuliano still hasn't given up. Fueled by the judge's rejection, she has now appealed to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, demanding that he hold a new trial outside of Brooklyn so that hopefully, justice will finally prevail.","In 2003, Mark Fisher, 19, was found dead after a night of partying with John Giuco .

An anguished mother has denounced the River Wear as cursed after it claimed the lives of both her young son and her best friend. Claire Hedley, from Sunnybrow, County Durham, was speaking for the first time after her son Ian Bell was swept into the river in April. She had given birth prematurely to Ian's younger brother Caleb just weeks before the eight-year-old went missing near the river while playing with friends. It was only nine days later, after a major search, that the youngster's body was found. Miss Hedley, 34, revealed yesterday that, in a cruel twist of fate's knife, her young son was the second person she had lost to the 'cursed river'. Her best friend Cameron Hawkins was also swept away by the River Wear's deadly currents six years ago. The landscape gardener, who was just 27 at the time, had been clambering on a rocky outcrop when a branch snapped. He slipped and hit his head on rocks before falling into the water. Four hours later a police marine unit recovered his body. Miss Hedley, who is a full-time mother, said: 'He was mine and (my partner) Ian’s best friend and we lost him in that river. 'That river is cursed. 'Ian (my son) was beautiful, he was a happy-go-lucky boy. He was just brilliant, really polite and never disrespectful. 'I am going to miss Ian the whole world over.'

Only four weeks earlier, on Monday March 26, Miss Hedley had given birth to Caleb 10 weeks before his due date, meaning he mad to by taken straight from his mother to a special baby care unit. Weighing a mere 2lbs 10oz, Caleb needed round-the-clock care from medics to help him breathe properly. He was in the University Hospital of North Durham when his older brother went missing. Ian had been out playing with friends near the Brown Trout pub in Sunnybrow on Friday April 27, where the nearby River Wear was swollen after heavy rainfall. In a cruel replay of the circumstances in which Mr Hawkins died, Ian plunged into the river after a tree branch he was swinging on snapped. It took authorities over a week to find the youngster's body under Page Bank Bridge, just three miles from the spot where he had fallen in. 'Cursed river': Police scour the River Wear near .

But Caleb is my life now, he’s just beautiful. He is what I put my time into, either that or I am down at the river or the graveyard. 'I hope nobody else in their entire lives has to go through this.' Miss Hedley also today raised questions over why it took so long to find Ian. Her son's body was eventually discovered by a diver acting under police direction. 'If anything like this ever happened again, and I put my hand on my heart and hope it never does, I hope the police have learnt some lessons,' she said. 'Everybody in the community had to help look for Ian. My boy was missing in that river for nine days and it was a member of the community who found him. 'I think the police could have tried a lot harder to find him. My partner Ian got a search team together that day and everything.

A world-renowned reptile expert and TV wildlife personality had to be airlifted to hospital after being bitten by a killer king cobra. Snake enthusiast Mark O'Shea, 56, had a lucky escape after the massive 10ft reptile clamped its jaws around his leg at West Midlands Safari Park yesterday afternoon. The deadly cobra - whose venom is strong enough to kill an elephant - dug its fangs into the reptile curator's leg during a routine feed. Scroll down to see Mark working with the king cobra . Deadly: Reptile expert Mark O'Shea with the King Cobra which later bit him at West Midlands Safari Park . Back at work: Mr O'Shea returned to the reptile park today after suffering no serious effects from the bite thanks to quick thinking medical staff . First aid staff armed with life-saving anti-venom rushed to Mark's aid due to fears that the poison had entered his bloodstream. But thanks to their quick thinking paramedics arrived to find Mark suffering no serious effects from the bite. O'Shea - best known as the presenter of the Discovery Channel series O'Shea's Big Adventure and Channel 4's O'Shea's Dangerous Reptiles - was airlifted to Worcester Royal Hospital where his condition was yesterday described as 'stable'. He was expected to be discharged from hospital this afternoon. Speaking from his hospital bed, brave Mark played down the bite from the king cobra - the world's longest venomous snake - and described it as 'just a nick.' He said: 'It was an accident. It was just a nick really. Sometimes there are accidents at work but it's just these sort of ones are a lot more interesting to people. Mark was bitten in the leg and was flown to Worcestershire Royal Hospital as a precaution . Expert: Mark has participated in over 60 expeditions and film trips, to almost 40 countries, on six continents, since the early 1980s . 'It was a lucky escape. I would class any snake bite that doesn't cause a serious injury to be a lucky escape. I won't lie, it did hurt a bit. 'We are going to have a full investigation but it was just an accident. I'm hoping to be out of hospital soon.' Bob Lawrence, head keeper at West Midland Safari Park, added: 'The animal was being fed behind closed doors. He's lucky. He has had a few encounters before but he is fine. 'It is very, very rare that these things ever happen. Working with animals like this always carries hazards with it, but we have safety measures in place.' King cobras are the longest of all venomous snakes and can reach 18.5ft. They live mainly in the rain forests and plains of India, southern China, and Southeast Asia - and their coloring can vary greatly from region to region. The venom from a single bite, whilst not as potent as some species, is still strong enough to kill an elephant or 20 people. King cobras are cannibalistic and their main source of food is other snakes. When threatened, the king cobra raises itself up, extends its hood and emits a bone-chilling hiss that sounds like a growling dog. The snake is one of the most dangerous and feared in the forests of Asia. King cobras are shy and will avoid humans whenever possible - but they are fiercely aggressive when cornered. Mr Lawrence said the safari park stored anti-venom for all of its poisonous animals, and routinely rehearsed such situations with local hospitals. West Midlands Ambulance Service said they received a call from the safari park at 4pm on Sunday and sent a doctor, an ambulance crew, a responder paramedic and the Midlands Air Ambulance to the scene. A spokeswoman said: 'When crews and the doctor arrived, they found one of the park's snake handlers being cared for by their on-site first aiders. 'They had already immobilised the leg and administered excellent first aid. 'The man in his 50s had reportedly been bitten on the leg by a king cobra. The doctor assessed the man and found he was stable and suffering no serious effects from the bite. 'Due to the fact the venom can be lethal if it enters the bloodstream, the man was airlifted to Worcester Royal Hospital as a precaution. 'Medics at the hospital were pre alerted to the arrival of the man who was said to be in a stable condition.' It's not the first time the daring reptile specialist has been attacked by a deadly snake. In 1993 he nearly died when he was bitten by a canebrake rattlesnake - and he has since been on the receiving end of several other snakebites, spider bites and scorpion stings. Expert Mark, from Telford, Shropshire, has participated in over 60 expeditions and film trips, to almost 40 countries, on six continents, since the early 1980s. On his website, the snake enthusiast says: 'I have been intrigued by snakes and other reptiles since I was a child and I kept my first snake at the age of eight. 'Now, almost five decades since snakes first attracted my attention I am still fascinated by their world. 'It would be fair to say that the study of these amazing creatures had dominated almost half a century for me.' VIDEO: Mark helped save king cobra 'Sleeping Beauty' from a malignant tumour .

A spokeswoman for the Letoon Hospital confirmed: 'We have treated three of the injured. They underwent surgery for various injuries but all are now stable.' Six-year-old Georgia Aitcheson and her father Christopher, 37, were treated at the town's Esnaf hospital for minor injuries and released. The hospital also treated 11-year-old Jack Holt and his mum Lyndsey, 39. A spokesman for the Esnaf hospital said: 'We treated four of the injured passengers from the jeep for minor injuries. They have all now been released.' Concern: The idyllic white sandy beaches and warm sea around Fethiye, Turkey, is a major draw for British holidaymakers, but the area has seen a number of tragic road accidents involving tourists over recent years . According to local reports the others injured in the crash on Tuesday were named as Ryan and Dawn Janes, 39, Harrison Janes, 12, Matthew Charril, 38, Mason Charril, 10, Jolie-Ann Whitaker, 55, and Paul Whitaker, 56. Jeep safaris are a popular excursion for tourists - giving them a chance to see a bit more of Turkey and still catch the sun in the open top vehicles. However, many safaris include water fights between the convoy of jeeps to keep customers cool in the searing heat. Unfortunately there have been many accidents as a consequence. Just four years ago a family holiday ended in tragedy when a father and daughter were killed in an horrific Jeep safari accident. Little Charley Pearce, eight, died at the scene after the open top Jeep she was traveling in crashed into a tractor laden with bricks. Her dad Jonathan, 40, died later in hospital. It was later revealed that the driver lost control after he was squirted in the face from a water pistol.","The group were flung from the vehicle when it struck a lamp post in the popular holiday resort of Fethiye .

Killed: Ashton Jojo, 11, was fatally electrocuted when she tried to retrieve her golf ball from a Florida resort's pond in June . The family of an 11-year-old girl who died after being electrocuted while playing miniature golf at a Florida resort is seeking more than $27 million in damages. Ashton Jojo of Latham, N.Y. let out a scream after reaching into a small, two-foot-deep concrete pond at the Orange Lake Resort near Orlando to retrieve her golf ball on June 27. On Tuesday her family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the resort seeking damages for the emotional distress suffered by parents David and Deborah Jojo and their 14-year-old son Donovan. Resort spokeswoman Stacey Sutherland told the Orlando Sentinel that company policy prohibits commenting on pending litigation. She said 'our hearts go out to the Jojo family during this difficult time.' The family's Miami-based attorney Ira Leesfield says the resort didn't hire a certified electrical contractor or obtain proper permits to replace aging equipment. Another person staying at the Orange Lake Resort rushed to help Ashton but was also injured in their attempt to save the girl who later died at hospital. Deputies from Orange County Sheriff's Office were called to the Kissimmee resort shortly after 2pm. Inspection officers found possible code violations of the water feature. Electrical breakers were improperly placed. Holiday destination: The 11-year-old was playing at the Orange Lake Resort near Orlando, pictured, when she reached into the small pond for her ball .

A South African mine where 34 striking workers were shot dead by police resumed operations today - despite only a third of its employees reporting for duty. Thousands of workers stayed away from the Marikana platinum mine, north-west of Johannesburg, defying a warning that they would be sacked if they failed to turn up. The ultimatum was issued by the mine's owner, London-listed company Lonmin, after some 3,000 employees walked out in a dispute over pay. Relations between the company remain tense after last week's violence, which left at least 78 people injured and led to some 250 arrests. Scroll down for video . Protest: Striking miners gather outside Marikana platinum mine. Only a third of the workforce returned to work despite an ultimatum threatening employees with the sack if they failed to turn up . Lonmin, the world's third-largest platinum producer, originally demanded that the workers go back to work last Friday, but it later delayed the deadline to today. Today the company announced it had moved the deadline again, by a further 24 hours, 'in light of current circumstances'. Some . miners had said the ultimatum was an insult to their dead colleagues, . who were killed when police with automatic weapons opened fire during a . demonstration last Thursday. 'Lonmin . can confirm that work at its Marikana operations resumed today as . significant numbers of employees returned to work,' the company said in a . statement. Determined: Striking workers said an ultimatum demanding their return to work was disrespectful to employees who were killed during violence last week . 'The company . can also announce that those illegal strikers who did not return to work . this morning will not be dismissed and have been allowed an extra day . in light of current circumstances.' It was unclear how many of the staff who arrived for work today had been on strike. Stand-off: The mine's owner decided to extend its ultimatum for a second time after two-thirds of the workforce refused to return to their duties . Lonmin . spokesman Sue Vey told the BBC that those employees who had arrived . were doing maintenance work to ensure areas of the site were safe for . mining. About 3,000 rock-drill operators (RDOs) at the mine walked out more than a week ago, demanding higher pay. In . its earlier statement, Lonmin had warned that workers could be fired if they failed to attend work today. It said: 'The final ultimatum provides RDOs . with a last opportunity to return to work or face possible dismissal. 'Employees could therefore be dismissed if they fail to heed the final ultimatum.' The . statement also advised 25,000 non-striking workers and 10,000 . contractors, who have been unable to work because of the violence, that . police believed the site was safe enough for them to return. Lonmin's . chief financial officer, Simon Scott, said: 'The safety and security of . our employees is paramount and nobody will be asked to report for duty . if the police consider them in danger of reprisals. 'The . vast majority of our workforce, and their families, who rely on our . mine for their livelihood, have now been unable to work for more than a . week.' Some workers, including Zachariah Mbewu, said the ultimatum was disrespectful. 'Expecting us to go back is like an insult,' Mr Mbewu said. 'Many of our friends and colleagues are dead, then they expect us to resume work. Never.' Killings: Police surround the bodies of striking miners after opening fire on a crowd at the Marikana platinum mine. Only about a third of staff have returned to work despite an ultimatum threatening those on strike with the sack . Anger: Thirty-four miners were killed and at least 78 people were injured during last week's violence . Violence: Police claimed they opened fire to protect themselves when miners armed with spears and machetes charged towards them . Demonstration: About 3,000 workers walked out of the mine more than a week ago, demanding more pay . South African president Jacob Zuma declared a week of national mourning after the tragedy. Shocking video footage of the incident showed police firing automatic weapons and handguns into a crowd of strikers for about a minute. Police chief Mangwashi Victoria Phiyega defended her officers' actions afterwards, claiming they had to protect themselves when miners armed with spears and machetes charged towards them. Phiyega said the strikers had not dispersed earlier, despite police use of water cannon and stun grenades. The shooting is one of the worst involving police in South Africa since apartheid.

A 70-year-old U.S. Open tennis referee accused of smashing a coffee cup over her 80-year-old husband's head and stabbing him with one of the shattered pieces was apparently having an affair. A search warrant affidavit has revealed police found numerous emails and notes between Lois Goodman and a man as they searched her Los Angeles home days after the death of her husband. The revelation comes just two days after police swooped on Goodman in a New York City hotel as she prepared for the U.S. Open. She was taken away wearing her competition tracksuit. The elderly mother of three has now be extradited back to Los Angeles, where she will face trial. As she quietly left a Manhattan court on Thursday, she was still wearing her referee uniform. Cuffed: Lois Goodman, 70, is led away from the Manhattan Criminal Court after being extradited to California in the custody of Los Angeles Police Department detectives . Motive? A search warrant affidavit has revealed Goodman was in contact with another man via email . After the death, she had originally claimed she had arrived home on April 17 to find her husband dead in their bed, and told police she believed he had suffered a heart attack and fallen down the stairs, before crawling back to bed where he died. But Mrs Goodman 'was communicating with a male individual through the Internet', a search warrant affidavit, seen by the New York Daily News, has now revealed. While they would not divulge the details of the notes, police added that they also found a handwritten letter to Goodman as part of the love triangle. 'The content of [an] email suggests that Lois was terminating a relationship and that alternate sleeping arrangements should be made in Los Angeles,' Detective Jeffrey Briscoe of the Los Angeles Police Department wrote in the search warrant request on May 16. 'Murder': The respected tennis referee, left, originally told police she came home to find her husband Alan, right, dead in bed, but investigations later deemed he had been murdered with a sharp object . Quiet: Her husband Alan was killed at their home in the Woodland Hills . section of Los Angeles, pictured, on April 17. It was only ruled a . homicide this month but police had always believed it was suspicious . It is not clear whether this relationship was with her husband or with another man. 'Lois . minimised what she had seen,' Briscoe said of an interview four days . after the death. 'Lois’ emotional reaction to what she had seen and the . loss of her husband was not typical of a grieving spouse.' She had told detective she arrived . home and found a trail of blood leading upstairs to a broken mug covered . in blood. She followed the blood to her bedroom, where she found her . husband not breathing, according to the affidavit. She then called 911. Before . he could be cremated, investigators intercepted the body and found . multiple lacerations on the right side of his head, three cuts on his . right ear and a blunt force trauma not consistent with a fall, the Daily . News reported. Investigators . also deemed the large stain of blood near the stairs suggested he had . suffered an injury and stayed there for some time, court documents said. Caught: Goodman is pictured after her arrest in New York City, where she was for the Open, on Tuesday . Blood . was also found on the kitchen floor, inside a linen closet and by a . garage, and mug pieces were found in his scalp, sources told the Daily . News. When she was questioned for a second time, Goodman said the body looked as if it had been positioned by an intruder. Despite these conflicting accounts . and suggestions of an affair, Goodman has protested her innocence. She . has returned to Los Angeles and is expected to be arraigned on Monday. 'I don’t know what happened,' Goodman told the New York Post from Rikers Island. 'It's a shock. This happened four months ago.' 'She's anxious to defend herself' in California, her New York lawyer, Guy Oksenhendler, said. Neighbours have suggested the death came after weeks of arguing. Police had even . visited the home a handful of times to see to disturbances, a groundskeeper, Alfonso . Rosas, said. Respected: Goodman has refereed matches with John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors, among others . Warm up: Goodman, 70, was in New York City to prepare to referee for next week's U.S. Open (file picture) A . neighbour told the LA Daily News that she once saw Lois in her front . yard and the woman said of her husband: 'He's driving me crazy.' After her husband's death, she . reportedly called a cleaner to deal with the blood-soaked carpets. 'She . didn't seem at all upset,' neighbour Michael Rudchenko told the LA Daily News. 'When we heard he’d fallen down and passed away, I joked to my wife, ""Somebody probably helped him die"".' After . a full homicide investigation on August 2, police ruled he had been attacked with a sharp object. 'It was a homicide. He had multiple sharp-force injuries,' Ed Winter, assistant chief of investigations for the coroner, said. Goodman . became a prime suspect - but she was already on her way to New York for . the Open, which begins on Monday. She was arrested in her hotel at 8 . a.m. on Tuesday. Locked up: She was held at Rikers Island before her extradition back to Los Angeles for a trial . Goodman is well known in tennis circles . and was preparing to serve as a referee at the U.S. Open Tennis . Championships tournament, a district attorney's office spokeswoman, Jane . Robison, said. She has refereed at the U.S. and Australian Opens for years, according to the Los Angeles Times.

Missing: Rebecca Weiss, who co-owned two businesses with her husband, is said to have vanished while diving . The mother of the businesswoman who disappeared on Saturday while free diving in the ocean said her daughter suspected her husband was having an affair. Rebecca Weiss, 50, did not return home from a diving expedition off the coast of Rancho Palos Verdes in California, in what is now being classed as a murder investigation. Alan Weiss, 60, reported his wife missing on Saturday evening after he found her personal belongings on the beach and her car parked nearby after she failed to return from a diving trip. He was the last person to see her alive. Her mother told KTLA 5 that her daughter confided in her shortly before she disappeared that she suspected her husband was having an affair. Vilma Causey sad: 'My daughter told me that she found it on the computer...He has a girlfriend.' As well as this, she said that while they are doing everything they can to find her daughter - including passing out flyers in the area - Alan Weiss has done nothing to help, which the family think is strange. She said of Weiss's behavior: 'Very bad, very strange. That is . not the reaction of a person that has somebody missing that is close to . you. 'Was she the only one on the beach to swim? Especially at that resort? No one saw her? No one saw her??' Mrs Causey also revealed her daughter's cell phone and keys are missing, but her credit cards and driving license were found. She was last seen by her husband leaving her condominium in a wetsuit and driving off in her car. Her brother also said it is hard to believe something could have gone wrong. 'My sister is a strong swimmer, and she was wearing a wetsuit, according to my brother-in-law,' Bob Causey said. 'So it would have to be something out of the extraordinary for something to happen to her out there.' Free diving is a form of underwater diving that does not involve the use of scuba gear or other external breathing devices. Instead, it relies on a diver's ability to hold his or her breath until resurfacing. Husband: Alan Weiss is accused of doing nothing to help find his wife and is said to have been having an affair . Danger spot: The Palos Verdes peninsula is a risky place to dive due strong currents and slippery rocks . Rebecca's mother Vilma Causey, left, said: '(Alan's behavior) is very bad, very strange. That is not the reaction of a person that has somebody missing that is close to you' The couple have been married 20 years . and seemed happy, according to friends, who said they traveled the . world and enjoyed their diving hobby together. Homicide . detectives have interviewed Alan Weiss but say he is not considered a . suspect, though they did turn her disappearance from a missing person investigation to a homicide case. Rebecca, who is described as being . 5ft 5in tall and weighing 115 pounds, co-owns two grocery . businesses with her husband. Her mother Mrs Causey said: 'There has to be somebody who must have seen. This is not an isolated place. This is a resort. There should have been people.' Her . clothes and other belongings were found near her BMW X5, which was . parked at the Terennea resort on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, near Los . Angeles, California. Mr Weiss told the LA Weekly blog . that his wife was ‘very experienced’ at free-diving, a discipline that . does not involve using any scuba gear and relies on the ability to hold . breath for up to three minutes.

A team of nine Taliban militants who attacked a Pakistani air force base in Kamra in the northwest of the country have been killed during a heavy battle before dawn today. The insurgents also killed a security official and left parts of the base, which is believed to be linked to the country's nuclear program, destroyed by flames. Hours later in northern Pakistan, gunmen forced 20 Shiite Muslims off buses, lined them up and killed them. Scroll down for video . Police officers make way for a firetruck at it leaves an air force base in Kamra, in northwest Pakistan after a militant attack before dawn today . The separate incidents emphasize two daunting challenges the nuclear-armed country faces: a still-potent threat from the Pakistani Taliban despite numerous military offensives against their sanctuaries along the Afghan border and sectarian violence in a Sunni majority country where Shiite Muslims often feel under attack.While the Pakistani Taliban have carried out hundreds of bombings and other attacks throughout the country, raids against military bases are uncommon. Militants armed with guns and rocket launchers stormed the key Pakistani air force base sparking hours of heavy clashes that killed eight people . The large air base, located only about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Islamabad, hosts a variety of fighter jets, including F-16s, and contains a factory that makes aircraft and other weapons systems. Some experts suspect the base could be linked to Pakistan's nuclear arsenal because of the weapons development there and the presence of jets that could be used to deploy bombs. The army has denied the base has any links, but the nuclear program's secret nature makes independent evaluation difficult. Western experts say Pakistan has about one hundred nuclear weapons and is in the midst of a rapid expansion of its arsenal.U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said 'the great danger we've always feared is that if terrorism is not controlled in their country, those nuclear weapons could fall into the wrong hands.' Pakistani firefighters leave the Minsas Air Force base after the completion of a commando operation against armed militants in Kamra . The militants, some of whom were wearing . explosives strapped to their bodies, attacked the base at around 2 a.m. with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades, according to the . air force. At least one of the rockets hit a . hangar, pierced the hangar wall and exploded, damaging one of the . aircraft parked inside, said air force spokesman, Tariq Mahmood. After the rocket barrage, the attackers scaled the wall surrounding the air base and an intense firefight ensued.' Security . forces, backed by a team of elite commandos, fought the militants for . two hours and were finally able to retake the base.

By the end of the battle, one soldier was dead and the nine militants . were killed, one of them when he blew himself up outside the base . perimeter. The head of the base, Air Commodore Muhammad Azam, was wounded in the shoulder, said Mahmood. Security forces searching the area after the attack found a 'few IEDs,' which they removed or destroyed. An aircraft is parked at the air force base in Kamra, which is filled with F-16s and other aircraft. The militant attack left parts of the base in flames . The base was once known as Air Force Base Minhas, named after a pilot, Rashid Minhas. He was lauded as a hero in Pakistan for foiling attempts by his instructor to defect with an air force plane to arch rival India in 1971. To stop the escape, Minhas disabled the controls of the plane the two were flying, and died in the resulting crash.Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ahsanullah Ahsan claimed responsibility for the air base attack. He said it was revenge for the death of the group's leader Baitullah Mehsud in a U.S. drone strike in 2009 and the American commando raid that killed al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden last year. He claimed the militants damaged three fighter jets. The Pakistani Taliban have waged a bloody insurgency against the government for the past several years that has killed tens of thousands of people. In response, the army has carried out numerous offensives against the Pakistani Taliban in the country's semi autonomous tribal area along the Afghan border. They now appear to be planning an operation in the group's last major sanctuary in North Waziristan.Panetta said earlier this week that Pakistan has informed American military officials that it plans to launch an operation against the Pakistani Taliban in North Waziristan in the 'near future.'In the sectarian attack, gunmen forced 20 Shiites off three buses in the Naran Valley in northern Pakistan, shot and killed them, said a police official. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was worried about retribution.The Deputy Inspector General of police in Gilgit, Ali Sher, said the victims were traveling from Rawalpindi, near the capital Islamabad, to Gilgit, a mostly Shiite area. Pakistani Air Force personnel cordon off the main entrance of the air force base following the attack this morning . There have been several such sectarian attacks in the region in the past by Sunni extremists who do not view Shiites as true Muslims. In February gunmen stopped a convoy of buses in the city of Manshera, ordered selected Shiite Muslim passengers to get off and then killed 16 of them. In April, violence between Sunnis and Shiites killed 14 people in and around the town of Gilgit in northern Pakistan.

The deaths in Laghman province are the latest in a series of insider killings that have strained trust between the allies ahead of  2014 pullout by foreign combat troops. It brings the number of foreign soldiers killed by local allies this month to 12, prompting NATO to increase security against insider attacks, including requiring soldiers to carry loaded weapons at all times on base. Allies: Afghan troops walk past a US soldier outside a military base near Kabul . They also come a week after US joint chiefs of staff chairman, Martin Dempsey, visited the capital Kabul to talk about rogue shootings and urge Afghan officials to take tougher preventative action. A statement from the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said: 'ISAF troops returned fire, killing the ANA (Afghan National Army) soldier who committed the attack' There have been 33 insider attacks so far this year that have led to 42 coalition deaths. That is a sharp increase from 2011, when, during the whole year, 35 coalition troops were killed in such attacks, 24 of whom were American. Afghanistan's government said on Wednesday it would re-examine the files of 350,000 soldiers and police to help curb rogue shootings of NATO personnel, but accused 'foreign spies' of instigating the attacks. The killings, many of which have been claimed by the Taliban as evidence of insurgent reach and infiltration, have eroded trust between the NATO-Afghan allies and are complicating plans for transition to Afghan security within two years. NATO commanders have played down the threat of infiltration, blaming most of the shootings on stress or personal differences between Afghans and their Western advisers that ended at the point of a gun, a frequent occurrence in Afghanistan. But the US general leading NATO forces in Afghanistan acknowledged last Thursday that the Taliban could be traced to more insider attacks than previously acknowledged, accounting for about a quarter of the cases. The Afghan government agreed after Dempsey's visit to improve the vetting of army and police recruits by requiring stronger guarantors, a more stringent test questionnaire and biometric data on all would-be and existing personnel. Rogue shootings: US joint chiefs of staff chairman, Martin Dempsey, has called on Afghan officials to take tougher preventative action against insider killings . More undercover intelligence officers would be recruited and placed in Afghan security forces to keep an eye on soldiers and police, while security force members with families in neighbouring countries would be heavily scrutinised for possible relations or exposure to cross-border insurgents. But President Hamid Karzai's spokesman also said the number of attacks was also relatively small given the presence of 120,000 foreign troops among 350,000 Afghan security forces. Taliban insurgents on Sunday killed 10 Afghan soldiers and wounded four in an attack on a checkpoint in volatile southern Helmand province, provincial officials said.","The deaths bring the total number of foreign soldiers killed this month by local allies to 12 .

Chris Christie wasn’t willing to leave his job as New Jersey governor to be Mitt Romney’s running mate because he believed the former Massachusetts governor would lose, sources said. Several sources exclusively told the New York Post that the fiery New Jersey governor doubted a win, and thought serving as Romney’s vice presidential nominee wasn’t worth the risk. The main reason for Christie’s doubt, one source said, stemmed from Romney’s choice to only release limited tax returns, as well as his disastrous international tour earlier this summer. Doubt: NJ governor Chris Christie, right, doubted Mitt Romney's win one source told the New York Post . The odd couple: Another source said Christie's doubt stemmed from Romney's choice to only release limited tax returns, as well as his disastrous international tour earlier this summer . One source told the Post: ‘There were people around him that wanted him to reconsider, to actually push to be vice president. But he’s known there are real issues here. Chris knows the score.’ Sources also said that the outspoken governor also worried about a Romney-Christie ticket because of two Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Because of the way the laws have been written, large banks and investment advisers would not be allowed to . Thus, Christie, who will turn 50 next month, would have had to step down from his government position to ensure top campaign donations. Another source from the Romney campaign added: ‘Christie refused to resign under any circumstances. It had nothing to do with Chris’ personality and everything to do with money.’ The governor has not yet commented on the Post's front-page story. Choice: Romney instead chose US Congressman Paul Ryan, right, seen giving a speech in Ohio last week ahead of the Republican National Convention . However, Politico’s Maggie Haberman finds several issues with what the sources were saying. She writes today: ‘No one has ever suggested Christie was actually offered the VP post, although he was in contention, and it seems unlikely he would have asked not to be considered.’ She said the bigger implication in the Post’s exclusive was that he thought Romney would lose the election. Christie will deliver the keynote address at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, which has now been squeezed into three days because of Tropical Storm Isaac. He has already been actively posting pictures ahead of the event on his Tumblr page. Republicans already in Florida for the convention are already buzzing about the possibility of a Christie 2016 ticket. Assemblyman John Amodeo told New Jersey’s Star Ledger: ‘I don’t want to be negative, and I really hope that Romney wins, but God forbid, if he loses, I would love to support the governor.’ Risky business: If he ran with Romney, Christie would have had to resigned from his governor post because of laws that don't allow for large donations to presidential campaigns for current governors . When the reporter first asked about the possible ticket, Delegate Amodeo pumped his fists in the air out of excitement. The governor, who is known for his tough public image and short temper with off-topic reporters, took his office in 2010. He told Oprah this past January that despite his list of political achievements, he still struggles daily with this weight, adding that he was working with a personal trainer several times a week and starting a diet to help trim down his waistline. However, it seems that the governor’s frame has shrunk very little – if at all – since the interview last winter, an issue that Russell Riley of the University of Virginia’s Presidential Oral History Program said may be a hindrance for a presidential run. Keynote: Gov. Christie will deliver the keynote speech at the Republican National Convention; he posted this picture of his and Romney's political buttons ahead of the event . Readying: A man cleans the stage inside the Tampa Bay Times Forum before the start of the Republican National Convention . Riley told Bloomberg Businessweek: ‘We live in a media age in which there are these conventional expectations of what a successful individual looks like. The closer you comport with those kind of cultural ideas about how someone on television looks, the better you do.’ Christie’s weight and prominent position has made him the punch line of many late-night talk show hosts, most notably Jimmy Kimmel. While hosting this year’s the White House Correspondent’s Dinner, the ABC late night host quipped: ‘It’s not the Olive Garden state.’ Following the dinner, Christie returned with a retort of his own, saying that at least he got to dine next to Modern Family’s Sofia Vergara.","New Jersey governor did not want to risk leaving his job to become Romney's running mate, sources said .

Twelve Mexican police officers have been detained on suspicion of deliberately opening fire on an armoured car and wounding two U.S. embassy employees. The incident has put a strain on U.S./Mexican relations and turned the spotlight back on serious problems inside Mexico's premier law-enforcement agency. Officials offered sketchy accounts of the shooting that do not address the reason Mexican federal police opened fire on Friday on the vehicle, which had diplomatic licence plates and was carrying a Mexican Navy captain. Scroll down for video . Worrying episode: Military guards stand in front of the armoured U.S. Embassy vehicle after it was attacked on the highway leading to the city of Cuernavaca, south of Mexico City . The officers were detained under a form of house arrest for 40 days on suspicion of abusing their authority. That charge can entail both criminal wrongdoing and extreme negligence. It leaves open the possibility of both a deliberate attack on Americans by corrupt officers and a gross error. Experts said either scenario was cause for pessimism about the federal police, which has long been touted as the best hope for Mexico controlling organised crime. Samuel Logan, director of the security consulting firm Southern Pulse, said: 'We're looking at another example of why there's significant concern over how Mexico has gone about training its federal police.' Mexican municipal and state police are seen as widely corrupt, incompetent or both. Military troops have been accused of an increasing number of human rights violations since President Felipe Calderon sent them into the streets in late 2006. Law enforcement problems: Two U.S. embassy officials were injured in the incident, which has put a strain on U.S./Mexican relations . Mexico's government has made a major effort in recent years to retrain the federal police, purge its ranks of corrupt officers and increase its numbers from 6,000 to more than 35,000 officers. Dr Tony Payan, an expert on Mexico's . effort to combat drug cartels, said: 'They have been pushed to do a lot in a very short time and they are recruiting a lot of young people and they try to push them through the training process very quickly to use new equipment, and to handle new intelligence and to handle operations that are probably better handled by well-seasoned veterans.' The reputation of the federal police was damaged in June after two officers fatally shot three colleagues at Mexico City's international airport. Authorities said the shooters were part of a trafficking ring that flew in cocaine from Peru. Mexico announced this month that it was replacing 348 federal police assigned to security details at the airport in an effort to quash drug trafficking through the terminal. Last year, a businessman from Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas, accused a group of 10 federal police officers of beating him, torturing him and driving him around town. Protesters: Relatives of the federal policemen involved in shooting at a U.S. embassy vehicle try to block the exit of a van carrying the officers to a federal detention centre in Cuernavaca, Mexico . They released him when he said he would give them money, but instead Eligio Ibarra Amador went to authorities and the agents were detained. In April, Ibarra was stabbed to death inside his home, which was then set on fire. His death came a day before he was to attend a judicial hearing to ratify his accusation against the officers. In the case involving the embassy vehicle, U.S. and Mexican officials declined requests for comment yesterday. Supporters of the detained police gathered outside prosecutors' offices in Cuernavaca, just south of Mexico City, to protest. The U.S. Embassy in Mexico City said that two U.S. government employees and a Mexican Navy captain were heading to a training facility outside the city of Cuernavaca when they were ambushed by a group of gunmen that included federal police. The Mexican government said federal police were conducting law-enforcement activities in the rural, mountainous area known for criminal activity when they met the car, which attempted to flee and came under fire from gunmen in four vehicles. Violence: The bullet-ridden car is checked by military personnel before federal officers were detained to get to the bottom of what happened . Neither country has offered further details, but experts said the incident would almost certainly affect the thinking of President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto, who has promised to both double the ranks of the current federal police and start a new paramilitary force known as the gendarmerie, composed of former military members operating under civilian command. Observers have predicted that the creation of the new force will increase tensions between the many agencies currently responsible for law-enforcement and public security in Mexico. Since 2008, the U.S. government has given $243million in equipment and $25million in technical assistance and training to the federal police under the drug-war aid program known as the Merida Initiative. Under Merida, more than 4,300 federal police have completed training at Mexico's Federal Police Academy in San Luis Potosi. Taught by law enforcement professionals from the U.S., Colombia, Spain, Canada, and the Czech Republic, the program includes criminal investigative techniques, evidence collection, crime scene preservation, and ethics. Congressman Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat closely involved in U.S./Mexican-relations, urged U.S. taxpayers to be patient with the development of Mexican law enforcement. 'We're seeing that in Afghanistan, Iraq, the training part of it does take a while,' he said. 'I am optimistic that Mexicans want to have a peaceful existence where they're free of drug violence. We need to have a long-term commitment and we need to understand it's going to be years.'

Spain's debt-ridden region of Catalonia will seek a rescue bailout of £4billion from a central government fund, it emerged today. The northeastern region, which has Barcelona as its capital, became the third region after Valencia and Murcia to officially ask for aid. Many of the 17 semi-autonomous regions are struggling with the recession, the country's second in three years, following a real estate crash in 2008 that has pushed the unemployment rate to near 25 per cent. Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy was meeting European Council President Herman van Rompuy on Tuesday for talks on the crisis, which is set to see the region of Catalonia ask for a bailout . Because the regions are unable to borrow on financial markets to repay their huge debts, they are being forced to impose severe cutbacks. When that is not enough, they must ask the central government for help. Spain's regions have a combined debt of £115billion and some £28billion must be refinanced this year. Catalonia owes more than £33billion. The government fund, which was set up on July 13 to help rescue the regions, will have £14billion in capital, part of it raided from the national lottery. If more is needed, Spain's central government will either have to issue debt at punishing rates or ask for a sovereign bailout from its fellow eurozone countries. It is becoming increasingly likely that Spain will have to ask for such as bailout as its economy struggles to recover and generate revenue for the government. A rush by consumers and firms to withdraw their money from Spanish banks also intensified in July, with private sector deposits falling almost five per cent, to £1.2trillion at end-July from £1.26trillion a month earlier. Revised figures released today by the National Statistics Institute showed Spain's recession is deeper than expected - the economy contracted by 1.3 per cent in the 12 months through the second quarter, more than previous estimates of 1 per cent. It is becoming increasingly likely that Spain will have to ask for a bailout from the European Central Bank, based in Frankfurt, Germany . Barcelona (pictured) is the capital of Catalonia, Spain's biggest region, which is set to go cap in hand to ask for a bailout from central government . The institute confirmed the second quarter's 0.4 per cent drop from the previous three-month period. The government estimates the economy will contract 1.5 per cent this year and 0.5 per cent in 2013. 'The latest data for the second quarter show that the downturn in the Spanish economy is deeper than previously thought and accelerating,' said from Robert O'Daly, senior economist for the Economist Intelligence Unit. He said that data revisions suggest the Spanish and Italian economies are on similar paths as both countries suffer the effects of fiscal austerity and weaker external demand. 'Their deteriorating growth prospects will make fiscal consolidation efforts all the more challenging and possibly counterproductive,' said O'Daly. Spain and Italy are hoping that the European Central Bank will approve next week a proposal to intervene in bond markets to lower the borrowing costs of heavily indebted eurozone countries. By buying bonds, the ECB would push their yields down. Expectation that such a plan will be approved in some form next week at the ECB's monthly policy meeting have already brought down borrowing rates for Spain and Italy. The impact was evident in Spain's latest bond auction on Tuesday, when the Treasury sold nearly £3.1billion in short-term debt auctions at much lower interest rates. The Treasury sold £1.3billion in three-month bills at an average interest rate of 0.95 per cent, down from 2.43 per cent in the last such auction July 24. It sold £1.5billion in six-month bills on a yield of 2.03 per cent, down from 3.69 per cent. Conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy was meeting European Council President Herman van Rompuy on Tuesday for talks on the crisis and will meet French President Francois Hollande on Thursday.","Spain's regions have combined debt of £115bn, with Catalonia owing £33bn .

A retired schoolmaster took his own pillows and duvet into a new £170million hospital wing because he was so shocked by the conditions in which his son was being treated. James Handy, 74, said his son William, 50, was 'shivering' under blood-stained sheets at the Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy, Fife. He also claimed that, when he raised concerns about mess on the ward, a nurse told him cleaners had refused to come in because they feared catching an infection. Disgusted: James Handy brought his own pillows and duvet into the hospital because he was so alarmed at the conditions in which his son William was being treated . It is alleged that one nurse even joked to William Handy that he would be 'lucky to make it out alive'. Scotland's Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon, who officially opened the hospital wing yesterday, has described the alleged incidents as 'completely and utterly unacceptable', and an investigation is under way. Mr Handy, of Kilconquhar, Fife, made the complaint while his son, a diabetic, was receiving treatment for porosis of the stomach - a condition whereby his stomach often rejects food. He took matters into his own hands by visiting a nearby shop and buying fresh pillows and a light duvet. Patient: William Handy, who is being treated at the hospital for porosis of the stomach, claimed a nurse told him he would be 'lucky to make it out alive' Mr Handy said: 'They said he couldn’t get an extra blanket or pillow because people had been stealing them. 'It was the same for the man in the next bed who has terminal cancer. 'There was blood on the pillow and blood on the sheets. The blood had turned black it was so old. 'Credit to the nurse. When I raised it she changed it straight away. 'But there was also debris on the floor, stuff like dust, and bits of paper. 'When I complained about this, the nurse said the cleaners won’t come in in case they catch an infection.' The ward was colder than normal because of a fault with the wing's new heating system. Mr . Handy, a retired teacher for the deaf, said he also offered to purchase bedding for the gravely ill man in the bed next to his son, but . the patient had already contacted his own family in a desperate bid to . keep warm. He . said: 'My son, like each one of my children, is so important to me and . the thought of him suffering makes me upset and very angry. 'We just had to speak up so that something was done and no one else has to endure this. 'You pay taxes hoping that when you need to use public services they will be there - but it's simply not the case. Desperate measures: James Handy said he had to buy fresh bedding for his son after finding him 'shivering' under blood-stained sheets at Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy, Fife . 'To think Nicola Sturgeon was swanning around pretending everything was great when this was all happening behind the scenes is just unbelievable.' Mr Handy said his son was transferred to another ward over the weekend but had still had trouble getting extra bedding. Speaking from his hospital bed, William Handy said he had been 'utterly dumbfounded' by the 'shocking' level of care. He revealed that at one stage a male nurse even joked to him that he he would be 'lucky to make it out alive'. I couldn't believe what he was . saying to me,' he said. 'He had been moaning on about having to do his . job and then, when he had to clean something off the floor, he made some . remark to me and the chap beside me about the level of cleanliness and . said we would be lucky to make it out alive. 'That is not an appropriate thing for a nurse to joke about. 'I have to have surgery later this week and it certainly didn't fill me with confidence.' The member of staff has been reported to management. Inquiry: Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon has described the alleged incidents at Kirkcaldy's Victoria Hospital as 'completely and utterly unacceptable' William . Handy said: 'I was visited by the head of nursing, who apologised . personally and assured me an investigation was to take place but it's . really too little too late. 'They . spend millions and millions on a fancy new building but don't want to . fork out for vital things such as clean bedding and enough staff.' When asked about the allegations, . Ms Sturgeon said: 'Obviously I don’t know all the details on this . individual case but if that is the case then it’s completely and utterly . unacceptable.' NHS Fife's director of nursing, Caroline Inwood, said they were aware of Mr Hardy’s complaint and were investigating. Mr Handy's complaint comes only a week after a patient at Forth Valley Royal Hospital, in Larbert, Stirlingshire, was told her operation was cancelled because medics had run out of bandages. The woman, who asked not to be named, said that she spent more an hour being prepared for the operation before being told it was off. A spokeswoman for NHS Forth Valley said it was 'sorry' that the operation was 'unable to proceed due to a temporary delay in the delivery of certain sterile bandages from the national NHS distribution centre'.","James Handy, 74, took matters into his own hands because he was disgusted by the conditions at Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy, Fife .

'Taxpayers deserve better': Public sector workers have received pay rises since the general election, despite a pledge by George Osborne (pictured) to freeze Whitehall pay . Hundreds of thousands of public sector workers have received pay rises since the general election, despite George Osborne’s pledge to freeze Whitehall pay. Six government departments, the NHS, the Armed Forces and the police were unable to halt pay rises due to contractual obligations to staff. Many were guaranteed annual increases if they passed an annual appraisal; for example, someone in a salary window of between £23,000 and £27,000 could move towards the top end, but could not progress to a higher pay grade. Staff at the Home Office, the  Ministry of Justice and the Transport, International Development, Business and Local Government departments enjoyed pay rises – although those at 15 other departments, including the Treasury, did not. Staff earning less than £21,000 were exempt from the freeze. Staff at the Home Office, the Department for Transport, the Department for International Development, the Ministry of Justice, the Department for Business and the Department for Communities and Local Government enjoyed pay rises. However, at 15 Whitehall departments including the Treasury, HMRC and the Department for Work and Pensions imposed an absolute freeze, except on those earning less than £21,000. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said public bodies were finding ‘crafty ways’ to get round the pay freeze imposed to repair public finances after 10 years of ‘unsustainable’ spending increases. ‘It’s high time that these bodies accept the severity of the fiscal crisis and stop awarding increases when they shouldn’t, as taxpayers deserve better value.’ Staff at the Home Office (above), the Department for Transport, the Department for International Development, the Ministry of Justice, and the Department for Communities and Local Government enjoyed pay rises . A spokesman for the public sector union Unison said the increases reflected staff training and rewarded workers who had reached certain skills levels. ‘The vast majority of staff have been very hard-hit by the government pay freeze,’ he said. ‘The increments do not go up indefinitely.’ A spokesman for the Treasury said: ‘Most of these will receive salary progression, except for when they have already reached the top of their band. ‘Progression pay applied in limited circumstances and will only be paid during the pay freeze where there is a legal requirement to do so.’",Department unable to halt increases due to contractual obligations .

A mother was saved by her 10-year-old son when she was attacked by a stranger in her own home. Sam Nye said she felt ';absolute terror' when an unknown man entered her house in the early hours of Friday morning and attempted to rape her . The 31-year-old said it was her son Jamie’s call for his mother which stopped the attack. Mother-of-five Sam had enjoyed a night in with her friends at her Middlesbrough home and was on her laptop while her children were asleep upstairs. Sam said: ‘My friends had just gone and I was sat in the living room and a man walked in and said “is Harry here?”' After informing the stranger that she was alone with her children, she got up to walk him out and lock the door. As the man went to open the door he turned on the spot and hit her in the face. The man dragged Sam into the living room before pinning her down on the floor. She said: ‘I knew what he was going to do. He was going to rape me. I felt powerless. He was really strong and I couldn’t move. ‘There was nothing I could do.‘ . As the attacker struggled with her trousers, Sam heard Jamie call her name. ‘Jamie never wakes up in the night. But for some reason he did that night. 'He called “mum” and I shouted to him to go back to bed, and that everything was ok because I didn’t want him to come downstairs and find me like that.’ She says her son’s voice affected the man he stopped trying to undo her trousers. ‘He got off me and kept saying “I’m sorry, I’m really sorry” before leaving.’ Sam believes the man did not rape her because of her son's calls for her. ‘The only reason he didn’t rape me is because of Jamie. I am so grateful to him for calling for me. Single mum Sam immediately called the police and went to the father of her two youngest children while police investigated the crime scene. Sam is hoping to become an archaeologist and is due to start a course at Middlesbrough College next week but says she is so traumatised by the attack she cannot even think about leaving her house, let alone use public transport. Police are continuing to investigate the attack which happened just before 1am on Friday, August 24. Saved: The single mother-of-five was attacked in her own home by a stranger who she says tried to rape her, but the assailant stopped and ran off when he heard Jamie call for his mother . Sam, who runs an online fancy dress business, has waived her right to anonymity to talk about the attack. ‘I can’t believe that someone could do what he did. It petrifies me that he is still out there. ’I am in absolute terror that he comes back or does this to someone else. All I want is for him to be caught.’ The man is described as white, in his early twenties, less than 6ft 2ins tall, of medium build, wearing a black jacket, dark tracksuit bottoms, with a deep voice and local accent. Detective Inspector Jim Devine of Middlesbrough CID said: ‘Offences of this nature are isolated but are very frightening for those involved. 'We have a number of officers working on this investigation and we would like to reassure the community that we are doing everything we can to trace this man. ‘The suspect is believed to be from the local area and we would again appeal for anyone with information to get in contact with us.’ Police believe a man who was seen in a nearby alleyway at around 12.15am may have information.

Culprit: Terrance Gaskin, 38, from Doncaster, who has been jailed for 26 weeks at Newcastle Crown Court after conning a 75-year-old dementia sufferer . An elderly dementia sufferer was fleeced by two conmen who charged her £2,400 just to prune one tree. The 75-year-old woman fell prey to fraudsters who told her it was a fair sum to have a lilac tree cut, a hedge trimmed and some rubbish removed. Newcastle Crown Court heard, despite considering the charge to be 'excessive', the vulnerable pensioner agreed for the work to be done at her home in Cramlington, Northumberland. But after she handed over a cheque for the full amount the conmen gardeners fled, having cut just one tree. Her carer then got involved and the conmen were tracked down by police. Terrance Gaskin, 38, of  Doncaster, and Joseph McElvaney, 20, of Stokesley, North Yorkshire, have both admitted fraud. Recorder Ben Nolan QC jailed Gaskin for 26 weeks, but he will not go to prison due to the time he has already spent on remand. McElvaney, who the judge said was the 'junior partner' in the scam, was sentenced to a community order for 12 months with 180 hours unpaid work. He had denied being involved in the negotiations where a fee was agreed with the pensioner and claimed he had been paid £100 for the work he did. Recorder Nolan QC told them: 'It was clear to you she was an old lady and this was a despicable confidence trick. 'The pair of you decided to trick a 75-year-old lady out of £2,400 by pretending you were going to do some tree surgery work in her garden. 'You did something, very little in my judgement, it would probably have had a value of no more than a couple of hundred pounds at most.' Trick: The pensioner agreed to pay the huge sum for three jobs to be done, including trimming her hedge (posed by model) Prosecutor Rachel Hedworth told the court the pensioner was targeted in September 2010 when two men came to her door and asked if she wanted work done in her front garden then given the £2,400 quote. Miss Hedworth said: 'She thought it was excessive but agreed for the work to be carried out. 'They said they would prefer cash as a payment and she explained she was unable to do that and would pay by cheque. 'The following morning two men attended and cut her lilac tree. 'She went outside and passed one of them the cheque. 'That is the extent of the work carried out because they then left immediately.' It was after one of the woman’s helpers questioned why she had spent such a large amount of money out of her bank account that the police became involved. The court heard by the time the case got to court the victim’s health had deteriorated to such an extent she would have been unable to come to court or assist with any questions that may have been put to her.","The pensioner handed over a cheque and the pair ran off having only cut back a lilac tree .

'Deplorable': Car thief Christopher Grenfell (left) has been jailed for life for murdering James Simpson (right), who was crushed to death as he tried to stop his Land Rover Discovery being stolen from outside his home . Dumped: Grenfell abandoned Mr Simpson's Land Rover in Crossford, Lanarkshire, after killing the pensioner outside his home . Grenfell claimed that Mr Simpson fell under under the Land Rover, but he was convicted of murder after a trial at the High Court in Glasgow. Judge Lord Burns jailed him for life and recommended that he serve a minimum of 17 years. Grenfell was also convicted of breaking into Mr Simpson’s house to steal the car keys and, along with a second man, 24-year-old William MacVicar, was found guilty of car theft. The pair stole Mr Simpson’s 4x4 from outside his home on November 29 last year. Mrs Simpson described what happened next while giving evidence to the jury. 'My husband immediately got up - he was a very fast mover - and he shouted ""They are stealing the car"",' she said. 'He was down the stairs in about a second flat.' Mr Simpson pulled open the door of his 4x4 and tried to drag Grenfell out as his wife begged him to come back indoors. Courageous: James Simpson, pictured with his wife of 46 years, Minnie, reacted bravely when he realised his Land Rover was being stolen, pulling open the door of the vehicle and trying to drag the thief out. But he was unable to stop Grenfell getting away, and was crushed when the thug reversed over him . 'A great relief went through me when I saw the car then going up the road,' Mrs Simpson said. 'I was then very astonished when the car stopped suddenly and I went into despair when it reversed back to where it had been.' Mrs Simpson said her husband was 'whirled around and around' by the force and added: 'I shouted stop, but no one was listening.' The Land Rover 'went like a bullet' away from the scene before Mrs Simpson rushed to her husband's aid, the court heard. 'Devastated': James Simpson's wife Minnie, who witnessed the incident, said her husband was 'whirled around and around' Mrs Simpson told the jury: 'I said ""You will be alright, Jimmy"", but he was not looking at me. He was just staring. 'I . was shouting ""Help me somebody, help"". My neighbour who is a doctor . came out and took his pulse. I was there screaming and screaming.' Mr Simpson suffered multiple rib fractures and collapsed lungs. His spine was also broken in two places. Grenfell dumped the Land Rover in nearby Crossford, Lanarkshire, before being picked up by a friend. He was eventually held for the murder on December 7 last year after a high-profile appeal to catch the killer. He initially denied that he had been at the Simpsons' home and branded claims that he was in the Land Rover as 's****'. During the trial, however, he accepted that he was responsible for the killing, although he told the jury that it was 'by accident'. He described Mr Simpson losing his footing and said he looked out the open door of the Land Rover and did not see the pensioner. He said he then heard screams and fled the scene because he 'panicked'. Lord Burns told Grenfell that he 'deliberately' used Mr Simpson's car to 'inflict fatal and devastating' injuries. The judge continued: 'His wife witnessed these terrible events in front of their house. 'She has had to relive these events in open court. 'The trauma to her and her family caused by your actions cannot be calculated. 'You fled the scene of this crime knowing that this elderly man must have been gravely injured and abandoned the car and threw away the keys. 'Your actions against him were deplorable and motivated by greed. 'No doubt they were also done in panic since you cannot have expected Mr Simpson to put up such vigorous resistance to your plan.' Grenfell, of Larkhall, Lanarkshire, was banned from the road at the time of the murder after being convicted of dangerous driving. Defence: Grenfell initially denied that he had been at the Simpsons' home, but he accepted responsibility for the killing when giving evidence during his trial . His criminal record also includes a string of road traffic offences and a conviction for assaulting a prison officer while behind bars. Outside court, Mr Simpson's son James said: 'Christopher Grenfell decided to counter the actions of my father by committing the murder of a 76-year-old man when he had the clear option of simply driving away. 'In the wake of this choice, he not only left a man dying in the street, but also left his wife absolutely devastated. 'My mother was a happy, confident and independent woman. Now my mother is shattered, nervous and a lonely widow.' He paid tribute to his father as a man 'filled with passion and compassion in equal measures'. 'He cared sincerely about people and would not hesitate to offer help and advice to anyone where he was in a position to help,' he said. 'He met life with a positive and unquestioning optimism.'","Christopher Grenfell, 25, reversed over James Simpson, 76, after the pensioner tried to stop him stealing his 4x4 from his driveway .

As Victorian artist William Holman Hunt found, painting over her is a good start. His portrait of this pre-Raphaelite beauty (main picture) did not always feature the steady gaze of this striking woman with dramatic brows and a tumble of auburn curls. The new beauty: Fanny Waugh's face in the finished portrait . What lies beneath? A close inspection revealed the face of the artist's previous lover . Previous occupier: The painting used to feature Annie Miller before she was painted over . Some years earlier it was the face of the artist’s previous lover and model Annie Miller, above, smiling out from the painting. When she ended her affair with Hunt in 1859, the unfinished canvas lay untouched for years until Hunt fell in love with Fanny Waugh – the woman who would become his wife. That’s when he got the painting out, scraped off Annie’s face and replaced it with Fanny’s. The secret about-face is revealed in an X-ray released by Tate Britain, where the painting will go on display this month as part of the Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde exhibition. The X-ray was taken during routine . cleaning of the painting. Although Hunt removed Annie’s face all those . years ago, some remnants can  still be seen thanks to the fact  that he . originally painted on to a white background. Annie’s mouth is smaller than Fanny’s and she has a shorter, rounder nose and less defined jawline. Experts say, however, that the finished painting of Fanny still bears Annie’s hands and maybe even hair. Historians . believe Hunt had intended to marry Annie but she was fiercely . independent and enjoyed the company of other men too much. Dante Gabriel . Rossetti, who along with Hunt and John Everett Millais founded the . Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in 1848, is thought to have also been her . lover. Hunt’s wife Fanny died in childbirth in 1866 – the year the portrait was finally finished. First lover: Annie Miller in a different painting by the artist . Hidden face: An X-ray showed she had been painted over . The painting, Il Dolce far Niente, also features a different background arrangement to the original draft, and the artist even sewed an extra piece of canvas on to make it bigger. In his memoirs, Hunt indicated that a third woman – a professional model known only as Miss Foster – also sat for the piece, but she is not discernible from the X-Ray. Curator Alison Smith said: ‘Hunt was a sincere and intense  man. He was attracted to striking-looking women. He loved strong independent types. ‘When Annie left him, he was devastated. He was very jealous of her relationships with other artists and quite controlling. He put the unfinished portrait aside when it ended and took it up again when he had a new fiancée. ‘The painting's title means “It is sweet to do nothing“, so presumably she’s looking out at someone who is her lover. She’s dallying in front of her  betrothed. ‘It’s a picture about acceptance, so it’s quite  understandable that the artist would want to show the  woman he wanted to spend his life with.’ The exhibition at London’s Tate Britain begins on September 12.",Secret revealed by an X-ray taken at Tate Britain .

In the past these were most likely to be written by expert food critics and printed in newspapers, with the eateries concerned often given a right to reply to less than flattering write-ups. But in the age of the internet anyone can post anonymous complaints or compliments online before a wide audience - and new research has shown how crucial these reviews are to a restaurant's future. Ratings: The research found a strong link between good online reviews and increased restaurant bookings (stock picture) Two economists at the University of California, Professor Michael Anderson and Professor Jeremy Magruder, have published their findings on the issue in this month's edition of the Economic Journal. Their work focused on the impact of positive online ratings on 328 restaurants in the San Francisco area - and collated this information into a star rating system on Yelp.com, a ratings website. Restaurants were given a rating on the site between one and five stars. The study found that eateries with an improved rating of just half a star sold out their 7pm bookings on up to half of the days they were open, reports The Observer. This increase was found to happen without any changes in prices or food quality - suggesting a strong link to the online reviews. The economists admitted that establishing a cause and effect between the reviews and a restaurant's success was difficult because those that got good write-ups were likely to be popular anyway. Reviews: Many potential customers rely on online reviews when choosing which restaurant to go to . Success or failure: A bad online review can have serious repercussions for a restaurant (stock picture) However, the study found that when a restaurant moved from 3.5 stars to 4 stars on the website the likelihood of it selling out during its busiest trading times rose by nearly 20 percent,The Observer reports. The impact of online reviews was found to be even more pronounced when there was little other easily available information about the restaurants concerned. The results of the study suggests that other popular rating websites, such as TripAdvisor, could have a similar impact on restaurant bookings.","Study finds direct link between good online reviews and increase in restaurant bookings .

A flight attendant has landed in the Guinness Book of Records book after spending an incredible 63 years in the sky. Ron Akana, 83, the longest-serving air steward in aviation history, worked his final flight from Denver to Kauai, last weekend ending his amazing career in the state where it began. Hawaii, however, wasn't his final stop. His destination now is retirement in Boulder, Colo., where he has been living since 2002 to be closer to his grandchildren. Flight attendant Ron Akana, 83, has landed a place in the Guinness Book of Records after spending 63 years in the sky . Mr Akana has spent his first few days of retirement writing thank-you notes to well-wishers. 'I wasn't expecting this much attention,' he said. He joined the airline while a student at the University of Hawaii in 1949, when friends spotted a newspaper ad - one of 400 applying for only eight spots. 'We didn't even know what a flight steward was,' he recalled. 'But it meant getting to the mainland, which was a huge deal in those days. 'It seemed pretty exciting and it proved to be more than that.' Jovial Ron became one of United's first male flight attendants. "" 'We just liked working with girls,' he said. When Mr Akana started, all of the seats . were similar to those of today's first class cabin. Many of the planes . had bars, smoke filled the cabin air, and passengers moved about freely, . often using a circular staircase to go between floors. He had to put his career on hold for two years when he was drafted in 1951 during the Korean War. Akana said his most memorable moments included meeting the cast of the 1953 movie 'From Here to Eternity,' Service with a smile: Jovial Ron Akana greets guests aboard a flight at Denver International Airport . High flyers: On one trip, Mr Akana served the entire cast of the film From Here To Eternity, including Montgomery Clift (left), Burt Lancaster (center) and Frank Sinatra (right) The 1953 Oscar-winning film, which . starred Frank Sinatra, Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr, was set in . Hawaii so he rubbed elbows with the stars on one of their flights. 'I made her bed in the stateroom. That was exciting,' he told The New York Times about the trip. 'Burt Lancaster had 12 or 13 martinis, then came and bartended with me as if he hadn’t had one,' he recalls. Over the years, he's seen it all. Passengers would dress up, not down. Think suits, not flip-flops. Smoking was no big deal, not a federal offense. Over time, though, things changed. The meal service became better. No more smoke. In-flight movies, which he said started to be shown seven or eight years after he began his career. And, of course, tight security after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Home away from home: Mr Akana met his wife when she worked as a flight attendant, and his daughter has now been working as a flight attendant for 22 years . Guinness World Records came calling a few months ago and later sent him a plaque recognizing him as the longest-serving flight attendant. He's been told he'll appear in the record book in October. To get a sense of how long he's been in the air, consider that if his 200 million miles counted toward United's frequent flyer program, he could treat the entire town of Big Rock, Ill., population 1,138, to a first class trip from Chicago to Honolulu and back - then once a month for the next 12 years, he'd still have enough miles to travel with his wife, Elizabeth, anywhere they want in the continental U.S. Their daughter Jean followed in her . parents footsteps as well, and has now worked 22-years as a flight . attendant for United, which recently merged and is now known as . United-Continental. Akana decided to retire after he was offered a buyout. But he admits being tempted to hang on for the arrival of the next super jet, the Boeing 787. 'I shall have to watch from the sidelines,' he said. While he's now retired, Akana is not done flying. From now on, his wife will be joining him. 'I got terrific travel privileges,' he said, adding: 'There's a lot to be seen.'","Ron Akana, 83, worked his final flight  from Denver to Kauai last weekend .

The mystery surrounding the death of British director Tony Scott has deepened after his death certificate was released - listing his cause of death as 'deferred'. Instead of the expected verdict of suicide, the Los Angeles Department of Public Health has decided to wait for toxicology and other test results and said the death is 'pending investigation'. The certificate states that an autopsy has been performed, that the 68-year-old died 'Under Vincent Thomas Bridge' - but also indicates that a biopsy was not performed on the dead body. Director Tony Scott's death certificate has been released following his August 19 death - but lists his cause of death as deferred . There has been no confirmation from . the Deparment of Public Health if the famed director of action films . such as 'Top Gun' and 'Crimson Tide' was suffering from cancer as some . reports indicated. Last week the coroner's office said that Tony Scott left a suicide note . and several messages to loved ones before he jumped to his death, but . none of them shed light on why he killed himself. Coroner’s . officials also said that the notes didn’t mention any health problems, . after reports circulated that the 68-year-old may have been suffering . from cancer. The much-loved film director died on Sunday after leaping from the Vincent Thomas Bridge - one of California's highest bridges -  into Los Angeles Harbor. Disheveled: Director Tony Scott has died after leaping off a bridge in Los Angeles. Scott, who had brain cancer, was pictured looking pained as he dined out in Beverly Hills on July 23 . Coroner's office spokesman Ed Winter . says one of the notes left in Scott's black Toyota Prius was a list of . emergency contact numbers and another found in his study included . messages to friends and loved ones. The note in the car listed names and . contact numbers - including that of his wife - so police could call his . friends to tell them of his death, TMZ reported. The mystery surrounding the suicide . deepened after the chairman of 20th Century Fox said that the director . was 'burning with excitement' over new projects just two weeks before . his suicide. It also emerged that just two days . before 68-year-old Scott leaped to his death he had been with Tom Cruise . discussing a sequel to their 1986 hit 'Top Gun'. The . pair toured the Fallon U.S Naval air station in Nevada, which is home . to the Naval Weapons Fighter School where the real life Top Gun pilots . complete their training. 'We had a meeting just two weeks ago . and he was burning with the excitement of creating stuff,' said Tom . Rothman, chairman of 20th Century Fox. Scott had more big-budget Hollywood . films lined up, but his death has left them in limbo, as well as . stunning his family and friends. Coroner's officers in Los Angeles . said that they were still trying to solve the suicide riffle after . Scott's wife Donna said U.S. reports that her husband had cancer were . 'absolutely false'. Brother: Ridley Scott is pictured here almost two weeks ago at his office in West Hollywood, Los Angeles in the days following his brothers death . Friends of the director said that he . had no marriage or money problems and was focused on the 'Top Gun' sequel which was preparing to go into production early next year. Scott was also in pre-production on . an underwater drug-trafficking thriller 'Narco-Sub', another smuggling . drama 'Lucky Strike' and a remake of the 1969 western 'The Wild Bunch'. While celebrity website TMZ reported . that Scott's wife didn't know of any serious illness that may have been a . motive, it raised the possibility that the director of 'Crimson Tide' may have kept his illness secret. If not there must have been a . different reason behind his decision to leap from the Vincent Thomas . Bridge in Long Beach on Sunday afternoon. He left a contact list of people to . be informed about the tragedy in the Toyota Prius he abandoned before . climbing a fence and jumping into the Pacific. The 68-year-old director, best known . for Top Gun, was said to have leaped to his death 'without hesitation' in an effort to spare his family the pain of watching his slow death, . ABC News reported. But hours later, ABC backed away from that report and the Los Angeles Times confirmed that Scott's family told the corner's office Scott did not have cancer - or any major illness. 'The . family told us it is incorrect that he has inoperable brain cancer,' Craig Harvey, a chief at the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office told . the newspaper. TMZ were the first to report that Scott's wife Donna told authorities her husband was healthy, according to unnamed sources. Donna Scott told investigators that rumors . of a return of her husband's cancer was 'absolutely false', TMZ says.

Tragic: Los Angeles polie officers pulled the body of Tony Scott from the water beneath the Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro, California . The denial of his brain cancer begs the question - what could have driven the successful director, whose . films have grossed more than $2 billion and who left behind a young family, to kill himself? Tony Scott's tragic death came just . weeks after he was pictured looking pained as he left a Beverly Hills . restaurant on July 23 - but friends denied he had problems in his . marriage to wife Donna. A source told the New York Post: 'He did have . cancer, and for a while he was cancer free. He didn’t have any money . problems or marriage problems.' The beloved filmmaker, who . directed movies including Top Gun, Beverly Hills Cop II and Enemy Of . The State and was the younger brother of director Ridley Scott,  fell within feet of a cruise boat around 12.30 p.m. on Sunday as horrified tourists watched. 'He landed right next to our tour boat, and many . of us saw the whole thing,' a witness, who had been on the cruise around the Los Angeles Harbour, told TMZ. According to the Contra Costa Times, Scott climbed a fence on the south side of the bridge, which spans San Pedro and Terminal Island, at 12.30 p.m. on Sunday and leaped off 'without hesitation'. A view of the Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro, California from where Tony Scott jumped to his death on Sunday . A witness, who was a passenger in a car driving along the bridge, said Scott looked nervous. 'He was on the roadway close to the fence looking around. He was looking around and fumbling with something at his feet. He looked nervous,' David Silva told the Los Angeles Times. Silva thought he was a stuntman or taking part in an extreme sports event - until he realised there was no safety cord. He went on: '[He] paused a couple of seconds and then began . to climb the fence. He put his foot on the top of the fence and paused . again. Then he threw himself off. I immediately thought, that guy is . dead.' Friends told the New York Post they were not surprised that the director chose to leap to his death as he was a thrill-seeker who loved scaling high mountains. Several people called 911 around . 12.35pm to report that someone had jumped off the bridge, according to Los Angeles police Lt. Tim . Nordquist. British-born Scott, who lived in Beverly Hills, was producer and director Ridley Scott's younger brother. Distinct visual styles mark both siblings' films - Ridley Scott mastering the creation of entire worlds with such films as Gladiator, Blade Runner, Alien and this year's Prometheus, Tony Scott known for hyper-kinetic action and editing on such films as his most recent, the runaway train thriller Unstoppable, starring regular collaborator Denzel Washington. Tony was the first of the Scott brothers to enjoy blockbuster success with Top Gun, starring Tom Cruise, the top-grossing film of 1986 at $176 million. Scott teamed with Cruise again four years later on the hit Days of Thunder. He also had a sequel to Top Gun in development. But Ridley Scott later managed more and bigger hits than his brother and earned a level of critical respect never achieved by Tony Scott. Gladiator won the best-picture Academy Award for 2000 and earned Ridley Scott one of his three best-director nominations; Tony Scott never was in the running for an Oscar, and critics often slammed his movies for emphasizing style over substance. The two brothers ran Scott Free Productions and were working jointly on a film called Killing Lincoln, based on the best seller by Bill O'Reilly. Their company produced the CBS dramas NUMB3RS and The Good Wife as well as a 2011 documentary about the Battle of Gettysburg for the History Channel. Besides Unstoppable, Scott worked with Washington on four other movies: Crimson Tide, Man on Fire,  Deja Vu and The Taking of Pelham 123. Other Scott films include True Romance, written by Quentin Tarantino, The Fan, with Robert De Niro, and Enemy of the State, starring Will Smith.","LA Department of Public Health have deferred listing the cause of death until after the toxicology results are back .

It's a crucial question in the Lord Lucan saga that has remained  unanswered for nearly 40 years: What caused the murderous rage that led him to kill the family nanny, batter his pretty young wife and then flee, never to return? Now dramatic new evidence can be revealed that throws fresh light on what may have driven Lucan   into such a violent fury before he killed Sandra Rivett with a lead  pipe and left Lady Lucan with serious head wounds. It comes in a remarkable testimony from former croupier Barri Hitchin, who claims to be one of the last people to have seen Lucan before he vanished, and who has finally broken his silence on the tragic events of November 7, 1974. Croupier Barri Hitchin tells how peer gambled away equivalent of £50K in an hour . 7th Earl of Lucan with fiancee Veronica Duncan on the announcement of their engagement in 1963 . Mr Hitchin said he watched in astonishment that night at the  Ladbroke Club in Mayfair as so-called Lucky Lucan, a notorious gambler, lost £8,000  – roughly equivalent to £50,000 today – in just over an hour playing blackjack, before exploding with rage and attempting to overturn the card table. The game started at 7.40pm and Lucan left in a fury at 8.50pm – ten minutes before detectives believe  29-year-old Mrs Rivett was killed at Lucan’s Belgravia home, an eight-minute drive away. Mr Hitchin added: ‘When the papers came out with the story of the nanny’s murder, I did wonder whether it was us that tipped him over the edge.’ Mr Hitchin, 61, who now lives in the West Country, had been working at the Ladbroke Club after qualifying as a croupier and was making ends meet while he saved up for  acting school. He recalled how he first set eyes on Lucan, wearing full evening dress, at 7.40pm on the night of the murder. He said: ‘I am very sure of his arrival time because I had just begun my 7.30pm break. I was ten minutes into it when I was asked to come down and set up a private blackjack table. Lucan came to the table with four £1,000 blue plaques which I would exchange for £25 chips as and when he required. Bad loser: Notorious gambler Lord Lucan with fellow card players at a London club . Lucan slammed his fists down on the table the night he lost twice his annual salary . ‘I took that £4,000 off him pretty quickly, maybe 30 to 35 minutes.’ Mr Hitchin remembered Lucan going to the cash desk and returning with another £4,000. ‘This time, I took the money off him even quicker – inside 25 minutes. At the end, he was down to his last £25 chip. ‘He looked at me, waiting for the deal. I politely reminded him of the terms of the game – minimum two hands; minimum £25 stake on each. His face went white, he became extremely aggressive and he barked at me, “Listen boy, when I tell you to deal, you deal.” I dealt the hand and Lord Lucan lost again. ‘In that moment, he exploded with rage. He clenched his fists and brought them down with a huge bang on the table. His face was contorted; he was absolutely furious. ‘My entire year’s salary was £4,000 . and he had lost twice that inside an hour. He tried to tip the blackjack . table over and David [a casino supervisor] and I threw ourselves on top . of it to stop him.  He stormed out and that was the last we saw of . him.’ Mr Hitchin said he . never told his story at the time out of a sense of loyalty to his . employers at the casino, and also because he feared his account would . never be believed in the face of what he insists was an Establishment . cover-up. He eventually gave a statement to a Metropolitan Police . officer by telephone earlier this year, following claims that Lucan was . living secretly in Africa. Old friend: Casino owner John Aspinall, who died in 2000, is said by Shirley Robey to be among those who kept Lord Lucan's whereabouts hidden for years . Mystery: Sir James Goldsmith, a businessman friend of Lord Lucan also incriminated in the plot, is pictured with the disgraced peer before his disappearance in 1974 . After the nanny was killed and Lady Lucan attacked, Lucan fled in a Ford Corsair borrowed from one of his gambling friends. It was found abandoned at Newhaven on the  Sussex coast. There were bloodstains on the front seat and a length of lead piping, wrapped in bandages, in the boot. It matched a similar weapon found at the murder scene. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police would not discuss Mr  Hitchin’s statement but added: ‘The inquiry has never been closed. Any significant new information will  be considered.’ The Ladbroke Club enjoyed a short but chequered history. In 1979, it was mired in scandal over how it lured well-heeled new customers.  Profits soared after the club paid a network of private eyes to note the number plates of expensive cars arriving at rival casinos and a corrupt policeman was allegedly paid to supply the owners’ addresses. They were then targeted with flowers and champagne, and hostesses would call them with offers of free dinners. Licensing magistrates closed the place down. The Hill Street building is now offices but lies empty pending refurbishment.",Lucan gambled twice his annual wage in less than an hour .

The 32-year-old, who is currently expecting her second child to NFL star Tom Brady, has commissioned a new blog post that supports a woman's right to a drug-free labour. The post, written by midwife Mayra Calvette who has spoken on behalf of the five-ft 11-in model in previous blog posts, is titled Gentle Birth: This Is The Way! It discusses a woman's decision to give birth in her home while being cared for 'by doulas, midwives and obstetric nurses'. Crusader: Gisele Bundchen has endorsed women's rights to a natural birth. A writer for the supermodel posted a blog titled Gentle Birth: This Is The Way! The blog post, seen on Blog.giselebundchen.com, was sparked last month after the Regional Council of Medicine of Rio de Janeiro's banned the involvement of obstetricians in residential births. The decision also prohibited the use of doulas and midwives during hospital births. The post by Ms Calvette, who was present when the model gave birth to her first child Benjamin Rein Brady in December, 2009, reads: 'These resolutions disregard the most current scientific evidence, the recommendations of WHO and the Ministry of Health. 'Furthermore, these resolutions do not respect the right of freedom of choice of women, families and from the professionals themselves.' Happy family: The model was spotted doting on her two-year-old son Ben in Boston in June (pictured) as her husband watched on from a park bench . It aims to discourage the rest of Brazil from following suit with such bans. Ms Calvette, an advocate for the home birth renaissance, delves into the extensive research she has conducted during a project titled the Birth Around The World Project. 'I traveled through several countries, meeting different cultures and birth models that work,' she wrote. 'I realised that the most socially developed countries tend to offer a humane and woman-centered care. 'Pregnant women have the right to choose their companions during childbirth... have the same room for labour, birth and post partum... and can deny any procedure with her and her baby.' 'I experienced the natural process of birth and it was one of the most life changing experiences for me' She visited England, Germany, Holland, Austria, Sweden and New Zealand during her research trip. The supermodel wrote on her blog in January: 'When Mayra told me her idea about the [project] I thought it was a beautiful idea and knew that it would be really cool if she could share a little bit of this journey on my blog.' 'I had the opportunity to experience the natural process of birth and it was one of the most life changing experiences for me and very very special!' The Brazilian stunner, who married her quarterback husband in 2009, is not the first model to have publicly endorsed all-natural births. Miranda Kerr sparked headlines last month after telling Harper's Bazaar UK that she opted against epidural anesthesia when she gave birth to her son Flynn. The 29-year-old Victoria's Secret star told the magazine that she decided to perform a natural birth after watching baby-bonding videos which showed that newborns go straight for the breast if they are without the medication. TheStir.com attracted a heated discussion, with one mother posting: 'Being a supermodel doesn't make you an expert.'","Fellow supermodel Miranda Kerr caused controversy last month, revealing she opted against epidural anesthesia when she gave birth to son Flynn in 2011 .

When his son was diagnosed with a rare medical condition that attacked his kidneys, Duane Harvard, 51, didn't think twice about donating one of his own. But his grateful 10-year-old son Raphael has nicknamed him 'Superdad' as a result. 'I don’t think of that, it was a . privilege, an honour, it’s the least I could have done,' Mr Harvard said. 'But he does appreciate it. When he takes his medication he is doing it for me in a way, he knows he has to look after the kidney.' Recovery: Raphael Harvard and his father Duane at Great Ormond Street Hospital after the kidney transplant . Mr Havard and his wife Anna, 35, from . Bedford, took Raphael to the doctors in February 2011 after he began feeling unwell. He was originally diagnosed with a . stomach bug and later with gastritis. But as his condition continued to worsen . over the next few days, he was rushed to hospital. Doctors consulted . Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) with the then nine year-old’s . alarming test results. His 'creatinine' level, a way of . measuring kidney function, was exceedingly high - the average level for a . child is 30-57 micromoles per litre and Raphael’s was 1,044 - showing . his kidneys were not filtering his blood. 'They just put him in an ambulance - we . live 70 miles from London and they drove him all the way there on blue . lights,' Mr Havard said. Surgery: Raphael, 10, suffered total kidney failure after his immune system attacked those organs . Close bond: Duane Harvard (left) said it was a privilege to donate a kidney to his son . At Great Ormond Street Raphael was diagnosed with complete kidney failure, caused by the rare condition Goodpasture’s Syndrome. The disease means the body’s own immune system reacts against some parts of itself, creating antibodies that attack the lungs and kidneys. It has to be treated with immunosuppressive drugs to stop this process. Raphael initially spent six weeks at GOSH where he had three operations, 20 plasma exchanges and two blood transfusions. Even when at home, he had to undergo around 11 hours of dialysis a night, his bedroom converted into a clinic completely with all the equipment and hospital-level hygiene. The family’s pet basset hound Charlie also had to be rehomed amid hygiene concerns. But Raphael’s only hope of recovery rested with a kidney transplant. Both his mother and father volunteered as donors - deciding it should be his father who donated the organ. 'We both put ourselves forward, he’s our only child and it’s just the immediate instinct you have. 'You would do anything for that child, we both wanted to do it desperately. 'We decided I would go first - we couldn’t have the operations in the same hospital and we thought it was better if his mother was with him in the hospital. 'You don’t realise it but once you have been accepted and you’re working your way through the process, you see how important that kidney is. 'There’s a lot of emotional and psychological pressure on you, your child is depending on you. 'You watch him, the difficulties at home, and you know the key to a better quality of life lies in you. It was such a relief to actually have the operation.' Looking forwards: Both Raphael's mother and father stepped forward to donate him a kidney. In the end his father had the operation . The operation on November 15 was followed by an anxious six-week wait to see if it was a success.And a few months later, the family’s life is starting to get back to normal - Raphael went back to school in January and his father is back at work. For football-mad Raphael, this year saw him get the chance to be the mascot at Manchester United’s match against Stoke City on January 31. For his father, the simpler moments are the most rewarding - such as seeing his son go to the toilet and drink freely without any difficulties. 'In life we take it for granted to drink when you are thirsty, we are even encouraged to do so and to go to the toilet when you feel the need to pass urine,' he said. 'However, for someone on a PD dialysis it is very different and often difficult. Their lives are totally controlled by restrictions and allowances. 'Even a treat like an ice cream or the milk on your cereal the fluid is carefully measured and controlled.' He said Raphael is now facing a healthy future. 'We had a rough year but it’s such a happy ending now,' he said. The family’s story is being . told in the documentary My Life: Me, My Dad & His Kidney, to be . screened on BBC1 on Wednesday at 4.30pm.",Raphael had one-in-a-million condition that caused his body to attack his kidneys .

"By . Tim Shipman . UPDATED: . 05:37 EST, 27 January 2012 . Nick Clegg yesterday demanded a £9billion tax raid on ‘serious unearned wealth’ to pay for tax cuts for low and middle income earners. The Deputy Prime Minister pointed out that billionaire oligarchs with £20million properties do not pay much more council tax than people in homes worth a fraction of that price. He also pushed for new taxes on air travel and pollution. Time for a cut: Nick Clegg has implored the Government to adopt the Liberal Democrats' mansion tax to pay for tax cuts for middle and lower income earners . The Liberal Democrats are privately backing ‘super’ council tax bands above the current top band, I, which kicks in on homes which were worth more than £424,000 when the bands were created in 1991. This is a variant of the party’s demand for a ‘mansion tax’ on properties worth more than £2million, which has been rejected by the Tories. Mr Clegg insisted that his planned reforms were aimed at the super-rich. He said: ‘I know the mansion tax is controversial, but who honestly believes it is right that an oligarch pays just double the council tax of an average homeowner, even if their house is worth 100 times as much? Helping hand: Nick Clegg today on a supermarket visit before he unveiled his plans to help the squeezed middle and lower income earners . ‘And who seriously thinks we would kill aspiration through a levy on the 0.1 per cent of the population who own £2million homes? ‘The mansion tax is right, it makes sense and the Liberal Democrats will continue to make the case for it. We’re going to stick to our guns.’ However, local government secretary Eric Pickles is opposed to  tinkering with council tax bands because he fears it will spark a nationwide revaluation process that the Tories have promised to avoid. Mr Clegg said he did not want to discourage hard work by raising taxes on income, but added that those with ‘serious unearned wealth’ should be forced to pay their fair share. ‘The UK’s tax system cannot go on like this, with those at the top claiming the reliefs, enjoying the allowances, paying other people to find the loopholes, while everyone else pays through the nose,’ he said. ‘This is about fairness in the middle. More money in the pockets of the people who need it. We support taxes on unearned wealth, precisely to lighten taxes on the wages of the hard-working.’ The Lib Dem leader demanded that the Coalition go ‘further and faster’ in raising the threshold at which people pay income tax from £7,475 to £10,000 – which will cost £9billion. The current deadline for this is 2015. The Lib Dems are likely to go into the next election demanding that the threshold is increased again to £12,500 – at a potential cost of a further £10billion. Mr Clegg said the changes are necessary because family finances have reached ‘a state of emergency’. It is understood that he has already won the support of Chancellor George Osborne to close a tax loophole which allows the wealthy to dodge stamp duty when they move by taking homes into company assets – raising around £1 billion. The Deputy Prime Minister also demanded a crackdown on tax avoidance and other allowances and reliefs enjoyed by the wealthiest in society, which he hopes will raise another £1billion. Ideas man: Nick Clegg set out his vision for a fairer Britain today . To make up the other £7billion, Mr Clegg said the Government should increase green taxes and crack down on the property assets of the richest in Britain. Business Secretary Vince Cable announced plans for an annual tax on expensive homes while in opposition. The policy would see owners of properties worth £2m or more pay an annual levy of one per cent of the property's value. It would raise an estimated £1.7bn a year from Britain's 40-50,000 homes worth more than the benchmark £2m figure. The idea was fiercely opposed by some in the Tory party who believe it will hit families and older people whose wealth is tied up in their homes. However Mr Cable has spoken recently of his desire to introduce the tax at the next Budget. In a speech to the Resolution Foundation think-tank, Mr Clegg said: ‘This will necessitate reform across the tax system, so that those who are better off, or who act in ways that damage our environment, pay their fair share.’ A senior Lib Dem source: ‘Property is pretty much the only asset that cannot be moved or hidden away.’ Sources said green taxes would not be imposed on motoring but would target airline flights. In the past the Chancellor has funded a rise in the basic rate income tax threshold by lowering the level at which people start paying the 40p rate. That has dragged hundreds of thousands of people into higher rate tax. Tories are concerned that the effect of doing this again will be that more parents will lose their child benefit under Mr Osborne’s plans to strip the handout from families with one higher rate taxpayer from 2013. Labour leader Ed Miliband said: ‘Finally Nick Clegg has woken up to the squeezing of people on middle incomes, but the problem is who squeezed the middle? ‘It is this Government that has put up VAT, this Government that is cutting tax credits and this Government that is allowing energy companies to rip people off on their bills. ‘I don’t think people are going to trust Nick Clegg or this Government to help the squeezed middle.’ By Alex Brummer City Editor . Nice to meet you: IMF boss Christine Lagarde with George Osborne yesterday - the latter has some work to do to stabilise Britain's economy . The odds on Britain experiencing a second mild recession, before the nation has fully recovered from the downturn of 2009, have increased. The disclosure that output tumbled by 0.2per cent in the final months of last year will be a huge disappointment to George Osborne as he brazens it out with his policy of budget austerity. But the setback is by no means the disaster which Labour, the unions and parts of the media would want us to believe. Unlike . large swathes of the eurozone, the UK emerged from 2011 with the . economy growing at 0.9 per cent. The interest rate of British government . bonds is at its lowest level in decades and the claimant count for . unemployment – the number of people signing up for the dole – is easing . after several months of rises. Clearly, the Chancellor was way off the mark when he predicted in March that the recovery would take hold in 2011. But . no one could have predicted that the Arab Spring would keep oil prices . high. Or that Spain, Italy and France would be sucked into the single . currency debt crisis. The . final quarter of 2011 was a mixed bag. Services, which make up more . than 70 per cent of the nation’s output, were flat but picked up in the . final weeks of the year. That should carry over into 2012. Output was . driven down by industrial production and construction which both . slumped. Manufacturing and exports were held back by a lack of demand . from the European Union. Bizarrely, . just as cold weather disrupted growth in 2010, warm weather was ruinous . over the last few months lowering the demand for energy from power . stations. Fears of a second recession will put pressure on the Government to do more to stave off further misery for ordinary households. The weapon likely to be deployed is a new round of printing money by the Bank of England. Osborne . will face calls to stimulate demand with tax cuts. The impact of . cutting payroll taxes (the equivalent of national insurance) in the . U.S., where the economy has taken off strongly and unemployment has . dropped, illustrates one method of getting people back to work. Little . impact has been seen from Osborne’s promises of lifting infrastructure . spending and providing credit schemes to help businesses. The . latest CBI survey suggests that business is not entirely moribund. But . for the Chancellor to sit around, like Mr Micawber, and hope something . turns up is not an option. He needs to get on the front foot with bold tax reductions aimed at boosting growth and jobs.","Deputy PM calls for Coalition promise to increase tax-free allowance by 2015 to be brought forward .

'Murdered': The sister of Shafilea Ahmed (pictured) broke down in tears as she described the moment she witnessed her parents allegedly killing her sister . The mother of a girl allegedly murdered for defying her strict Muslim parents began the fatal attack with the words 'Just finish it here', a court heard yesterday. As Shafilea Ahmed's younger brother and sisters watched, an argument which began over the 17-year-old wearing a skimpy T-shirt ended with her parents pushing a plastic bag in her mouth and suffocating her on the settee, the jury was told. Her younger sister Alesha, then just 15, said she saw Shafilea's eyes bulging as she gasped for breath and kicked out while Iftikhar Ahmed and his wife Farzana held their hands over her face. She told the jury that after the couple pushed Shafilea's limp body on to the floor, her father punched the teenager once in the chest at the family home in Warrington. That evening, she said, their 13-year-old brother Junyade told his surviving sisters: 'She deserved it.' Shafilea's remains were found on a  riverbank in Cumbria five months later. But it was not until 2010 that Alesha – now 23 – came forward to give her account of the killing. Giving evidence from behind a screen at Chester Crown Court for a second day, Alesha said her sister wanted to continue in the sixth form of her secondary school to further her ambition of becoming a lawyer. However her parents objected because of the westernised lifestyle she and her friends there had led, so she went to a nearby college instead. Shafilea also got a part-time telesales job after lessons, the court heard, and would be picked up by one of her parents every evening. On September 11, 2003, said Alesha, she accompanied her mother to bring Shafilea home. The 17-year-old was wearing a lilac V-neck T-shirt and white trousers made from stretchy material with ties at the hips, while she was carrying a cardigan. Asked about their mother's reaction by prosecutor Andrew Edis, QC, she answered: 'She wasn't happy about her being in just a T-shirt.' When they got home, Mrs Ahmed spoke to her taxi driver husband, and the argument about 'her not wearing her jumper' continued in the living room, she added. Accused of murder: Shafelia's mother Farzana Ahmed, left, and Iftikhar Ahmed, right, at Chester Crown Court . The mother then passed Shafilea's bags to her son to search for money and boys' numbers, which was normal practice. After he found cash including a £20 note, the argument escalated, Alesha added, as the siblings plus their two younger sisters – aged 12 and seven – looked on. Then, she told the jury: 'My mum said ""Just finish it here"" to my dad.' She said her mother had spoken the words in Urdu. Alesha said her mother then pushed Shafilea on to the settee before both parents started hitting her and one said: 'Grab a bag.' Family home: The Ahmeds lived in this house in Warrington, Cheshire . Sobbing and taking long pauses, she continued: 'They put it in her mouth and put their hands over her.' As her mother dabbed  at her eyes in the dock, Alesha told the jury her father had  held Shafilea down as she kicked out desperately. Alesha said her sister's eyes were 'just open, really wide' and 'you could tell she was just gasping for air'. Finally, she said, Shafilea stopped struggling: 'That was it – she was gone.' But she added: 'They carried on with their hands still on her mouth, even when she had stopped struggling.' Her father pulled Shafilea's body off the settee 'and straight after that he just punched her in the chest for no reason, just once'. On trial: Iftikhar Ahmed, left, and Farzana Ahmed, right, are said to have killed their 17-year-old daughter because she refused to obey them . Alesha said she went upstairs to the bedroom the sisters shared before sneaking back down and seeing her mother in the kitchen, sorting through old 'flowery' sheets, bin bags and rolls of tape. Later, through the curtains, she glimpsed her father carrying a dark package up the driveway with his arms outstretched, 'like a cradle', she said. 'The way he was carrying it, it just looked like it was my sister.' Tragic: Shafilea had been a keen student at her school in Warrington, Cheshire, and enjoyed trips to shopping centres and wearing Western clothes . Shortly afterwards, she heard a car leaving. She said the siblings were all crying and upset – apart from Junyade. 'My brother said to me and my sisters that she deserved it.' Alesha said she was told to say Shafilea had run away from home. The next day, however, she 'blurted out' to  three friends that her father had killed her sister and chopped up her body, but begged them to keep it secret. After school, for the first time ever, she changed into clothes belonging to Shafilea and went with friends to a park, drinking cider and alcopops, she said. But rumours were already swirling around that Shafilea had been 'chopped up' and 'buried in the family's back garden', so she returned home. Shafilea was reported missing after teachers heard the rumours but, when questioned by police, Alesha denied saying she had been killed. Asked by Mr Edis what she thought would happen to her if she had repeated her account to police, she answered: 'The same thing that happened to my sister.' She said her parents warned their children to 'be careful' of what they said inside the house in case listening devices had been planted by police. It was only in 2010 after Alesha was arrested over a robbery at the family home during which her mother, surviving sisters and brother were tied up that she told police she had seen Shafilea's killing. Mr Edis has told the court Alesha admits her role in the robbery and has been given no 'inducements' to give evidence against her parents. Iftikhar Ahmed, 52, and his 49-year-old wife deny murder. The case continues. A desperate Shafilea swallowed bleach during a trip to Pakistan after her mother told her she was to stay there permanently, her sister said. Alesha said Shafilea – then 16 – went straight to the bathroom, then moments later 'everyone just heard her screaming and she was holding her stomach'. Next to her was an industrial-sized bottle of bleach with the lid off. The incident, in March 2003 during a power cut at her grandparents' house in rural Pakistan, badly damaged Shafilea's throat. Their grandmother said she needed to go to hospital, but the girls' mother reacted differently, Alesha told the jury. 'I'm sure she said she was okay when it was very clear she wasn't,' she said. In hospital, Alesha said, her mother told Shafilea to say it was a mistake and she was 'supposed to drink mouthwash but because it was dark she drank bleach instead'. The prosecution say Shafilea had been drugged and put on a one-way flight to Pakistan after trying to cut her ties with her parents. While she was in the village where both her parents were born, several local families proposed that Shafilea should marry their sons, said Alesha, giving her photographs of men with moustaches and oiled hair. 'She was just not interested at all.' After the bleach incident, Shafilea returned to England for hospital treatment. She lost more than two stone because she could not swallow food. One side effect was that she needed saliva to be wiped from her face regularly when her family visited her, said Alesha. 'Mum just made a face about not wanting to wipe it up', so one of the sisters or their father did it instead. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Younger sister Alesha broke down in tears as she described the moment Shafilea was allegedly killed for being 'westernised'

He graduated from the prestigious Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania. In 2010, he and his wife pledged $50million to the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System. Activist investor Carl Icahn earned . $2.5 billion during a year that his firm made about 35 per cent and . mathematics professor turned hedge fund founder James Simons made $2.1 . billion. Citadel's Kenneth . Griffin and SAC Capital Advisors' Steve Cohen, long-time top earners, . rounded out the top five, taking home $700 million and $585 million, . respectively. Mr Griffin is known as a high-roller. Worth an estimated $3billion, he had his lavish wedding reception at the Palace of Versailles in 2004, marrying Harvard Business grad Anne Dias. Mrs Dias-Griffin herself has spot-on business chops, having worked at Goldman Sachs and founding Chicago-based Aragon Global Management. Despite owning at least three properties, they are a charitable couple, donating $19million to the Art Institute of Chicago for a modern art wing. Mr Dalio, Mr Simons, and Mr Cohen cruised into top positions for the second year in a row, though in 2010 each of their paydays was bigger, according to AR's calculations. Hedge funds managers typically charge investors two per cent for managing their money, meaning that the industry's very largest funds often present their managers with the biggest checks. In good years, managers can also skim off 20 per cent or more of the profits from their trades. New arrivals to the top 25 in 2011 included Mr Dalio's deputies at Bridgewater, Greg Jensen and Robert Prince, the firm's co-chief investment officers. Industry veteran Paul Singer of Elliott Management Corp also scored a place in the exclusive group. AR has been estimating industry compensation since 2011 and the list is always closely watched, especially now that Wall Street pay checks are being scrutinized extra hard after the 2008 financial crisis. AR's rankings closely correspond to the Forbes magazine list of 40 highest-earning managers of 2011, though the amount of compensation varies. In that survey the top 40 profit-makers pocketed $13.2 billion. Mr Dalio topped the chart on that list too. However, Forbes estimated his earnings at about $3billion, about $1billion less than AR calculated. Determining the earnings of top hedge fund managers requires some amount of guesswork, since funds do not publicly disclose compensation. AR bases its estimates on the fees charged by funds and the percentage of capital a manager is believed to have in his fund. On the Forbes list, Mr Simons was runner-up to Mr Dalio instead of AR's No. 2 placeholder, Icahn, who placed third.

Shocked at the cost: Dennis Rushen, left, has now cut up his SIM card after finding out his son Oscar has run up the astronomical bill speaking to his girlfriend . They say that true love conquers all. But there are always hurdles along the way. In 12-year-old Oscar Rushen’s case, the hurdle was a £1,700 phone bill, run up in only a month as he chatted to his 13-year-old girlfriend on his father’s mobile. The schoolboy now relies on Facebook while his father Dennis – who cut up his SIM card when he found out – battles with Vodafone over the bill. Mr Rushen, who is divorced, accused . the network of being greedy, saying it should have intervened when the . £10.50-a-month contract suddenly went up to hundreds of pounds a week. The . 65-year-old said: ‘When I saw this massive bill, I thought there must . be a mistake. 'It turned out there were sometimes several calls a day and . they could last more than two hours. ‘Part of the problem is Vodafone don’t post bills any more and they don’t even email them. ‘You . have to go online to see them so the onus is on you to check. 'But if . your bill is 80 to 100 times higher than normal questions should be . asked. They are just greedy.’ Oscar . struck up the relationship at the start of March after meeting the . girl, called Charlie, at a youth club near his mother’s home in Banham, . Norfolk. Unable to meet . regularly because of the eight miles between Banham and her home in a . nearby village, the pair began a telephone romance. Mr Rushen, who lives . in Attleborough, Norfolk, discovered the price  of their love a month . into  the relationship. The racing car driver manager said: ‘I went straight to a Vodafone shop and they told me to write to customer services. ‘I’ve done that and I’ve made lots of calls – although I didn’t think at first and Oscar was still making calls when the complaint began,’ he added. ‘In the end I told him to give me his SIM card. I cut it up and told him I wasn’t paying any more. ‘When we went into a shop shortly . afterwards he bought me a bottle of Coke and asked if he did that every . day for the rest of my life would it be enough.’ Unaware: Oscar Rushen said he did not realise that he was racking up such an enormous mobile phone bill . Mr Rushen, who has been with Vodafone for 15 years, said he would be cancelling the 12-month contract, which was in his name, when it ends this month. He has now given his son a pay-as-you-go phone. Oscar said: ‘I didn’t realise how it worked. I’m 12 and I don’t know much about it. I feel really bad for my dad. ‘Charlie’s phone is with O2 and when she went over her limit they shut it off. ‘I didn’t realise Vodafone were the only people who don’t  do that.’ The £10.50 deal comes with 300 free minutes per month and unlimited text messages. Any extra calls cost 35p per minute.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:23 EST, 12 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:23 EST, 12 June 2012 . Russia is sending attack helicopters to Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime, Hillary Clinton claimed tonight. The Arab country's bloody 15-month conflict could become 'dramatically' worse if the arms shipment goes ahead, the U.S. Secretary of State warned. If true, it dashes any hopes of a peace agreement as Western countries had hoped Russia and China would agreeing on a transition plan that would end the four-decade-long Assad regime. Mrs Clinton said the U.S. was ‘concerned about the latest information we have that there are attack helicopters on the way from Russia to Syria.’ Deadly: Russian Kamov KA 50 attack helicopters like abive may be among an alleged arms shipments to Syria . Mrs Clinton, who spoke at a public . appearance with Israeli President Shimon Peres in Washington augured . poorly for a peaceful solution to Syria's conflict, ‘will escalate the conflict quite dramatically’. But Moscow has consistently rejected outside forces to end the conflict or any international plan to force regime change in Damascus. Russia and Syria have a long-standing military relationship and Syria hosts Russia's only naval base on the Mediterranean Sea. But Moscow insists that any arms it supplies to Syria - which may include attack helicopters like the Kamov KA 50 - are not being used to quell . anti-government dissent. U.S. criticicm came hours after a UN report alleged that Syrian troops have tortured children, executed them and used some as young as eight as 'human shields' during military raids against rebels. The United Nations branded the Syrian government one of the worst offenders on its annual 'list of shame' of conflict countries where children are killed, abused and forced to fight. Human rights groups estimate that about 1,200 children have died during the 15-month uprising against President Bashar al-Assad, whose brutal crackdown on Arab Spring-inspired protests has been widely condemned. Brutal crackdown: Children join the protests against Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in Habeet, near Idlib, as a UN report documents shocking abuses and killings of boys and girls at the hands of the government . Demanding change: Demonstrators in Kafranbel, near Idlib hold a placard (left) that reads: 'Are you dumb? Is there any sane person who really believes there could be a peaceful solution?' 'Rarely have I seen such brutality against children as in Syria, where girls and boys are detained, tortured, executed, and used as human shields,' Radhika Coomaraswamy, UN special representative for children in armed conflict, said ahead of the report's release. Government forces rounded up dozens of boys aged eight to 13 before an attack on the village of Ayn l'Arouz in Idlib province on March 9, the report said. The children were 'used by soldiers and militia members as human shields, placing them in front of the windows of buses carrying military personnel into the raid on the village,' it said. Quoting witnesses, the UN report said Syrian military and intelligence forces, as well as pro-government Shabiha militiamen, surrounded the village for an attack that lasted more than four days. Among the 11 dead on the first day were three boys aged 15 to 17. Conflict continues: An image grab taken from a video uploaded on YouTube on Monday shows smoke billowing from the flashpoint Syrian city of Homs which activists said was being attacked by regime forces . 'Grave violations': The UN report says government forces have been using children as shields while attacking, torturing and killing residents during the 15-month crackdown on protesters . Another 34 people, including two boys aged 14 and 16 and a nine-year-old girl, were detained. 'Eventually, the village was reportedly left burned and four out of the 34 detainees were shot and burned, including the two boys aged 14 and 16 years,' the Children in Armed Conflict report said. UN chief Ban Ki-moon said the report had uncovered one of many 'grave violations' against children. The Syrian government, and its allied militias, was one of four new parties added to the UN's list of shame - along with organizations and political parties in Sudan and Yemen. The list includes 52 parties in 11 countries, ranging from the Afghan national police and the anti-US Haqqani network to the Lord's Resistance Army in central Africa, Sudanese armed forces and various Darfur rebel groups. The report said children in Syria as young as nine had been victims of killing and maiming, arbitrary arrest, detention, torture and ill treatment, including sexual violence and use as human shields. Outrage: Mourners attend a mass burial in Syria for more than 100 people, half of whom were children, killed in a massacre in the city of Houla last month . International attention: UN observers view bodies at a hospital morgue before the burial of the Houla dead . Schools have been regularly raided and used as military bases and detention centers, the report said. The report was completed before the Houla massacre on May 25, when 49 of the 108 victims were said to be children, some as young as two and three, who were shot in the head or had their skulls smashed with blunt instruments. 'Most child victims of torture described being beaten, blindfolded, subjected to stress positions, whipped with heavy electrical cables, scarred by cigarette burns and, in one recorded case, subjected to electrical shock to the genitals,' said the UN report. At least one witness told investigators he had seen a boy of approximately 15 succumb to repeated beatings. The New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the UN Security Council should impose an arms embargo and other sanctions on the Assad government over its violations against children. HRW quoted the Syria Violations Documentation Center, a network of Syrian activists, as saying that at least 1,176 children have been killed since February 2011. It also said there were 'credible allegations' that armed opposition groups, including the Free Syrian Army (FSA), are recruiting children as soldiers. Justin Forsyth, chief executive of international charity Save the Children, said: 'United Nations reports of children being used as human shields and being forced to work on the front lines are shocking and deeply worrying, and the perpetrators of these crimes must be held to account. 'This is contrary to International law, and we call on all sides to ensure that children are protected and kept safe from danger. All parties must now allow unhindered humanitarian access to help young people and their families.'","U.S. Secretary of State says arms shipment could increase death toll .

"PUBLISHED: . 05:30 EST, 20 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:27 EST, 20 June 2012 . Polish authorities believe a body found floating in a canal is that of an Irish football fan after documents in his name were discovered on the corpse. The 21-year-old James Nolan disappeared in the early hours of Sunday morning in the northern city of Bydgoszcz, sparking a huge search effort. Police divers found a body early this morning and authorities are awaiting Mr Nolan's father to arrive later to formally identify it. Scroll down for video . Plea: One of the posters plastered around the northern Polish city of Bydgoszcz . Prosecutor Wlodzimierz Marszalkowski says the soaked documents were Mr Nolan's insurance and credit card. A spokesman for prosecutors, Jan . Bednarek, said: 'There is a high probability that this is the body of . the man we have been searching for'. The body was found lying face down in fast-flowing water of the Bydgoszcz Canal and trapped by a weir that runs across it. The canal is an offshoot of the city's Brda River, and brings water for a small hydroelectric plant. No signs of violence were apparent, deputy chief prosecutor Wlodzimierz Marszalkowski said. Robbery didn't appear to be the motive since 600 zlotys (£114) and a credit card were found on the corpse, he said. An autopsy was planned for Thursday. The clothing on the body matched a description given by friends of what Nolan was wearing when he went missing, officials said. Before today, a time-stamped photo on a friend's phone was the last trace authorities had of Mr Nolan, who had travelled to Poland to support Ireland at Euro 2012. On the trail: Police divers in Bydgoszcz search the Brda River for signs of the student, who has been missing since Sunday morning . Widening the net: Polish officers on a police boat travel along the city's historic waterfront, which is lined with restaurants and bars . The image shows Mr Nolan with his . friends at 2am on Sunday, but everything after that is a mystery, one . compounded by the blurry memory of friends who had been drinking. Now, . an intense search is under way across the city and in its Brda River, . involving more than 100 police officers. Photos . of Mr Nolan have been plastered around the city and one police official . says the disappearance is highly unusual for a usually peaceful place. 'Nothing like this has ever happened (here) before,' Ms Chlebicz said yesterday, providing new details into the search. Mr . Nolan's own phone has been out of service since around the time he was . last photographed. After his friends had slept and woke up later on . Sunday morning, they tried calling Mr Nolan in his hotel room and only . then realised he had never returned. They then went back to the riverside bars where they had been the night before to look for him, but about 15 hours passed before they reported him missing. Police said they have no information pointing to foul play and that so far they are treating Mr Nolan as a missing person. Rescue divers were called in yesterday to begin a search of the Brda River, which runs through the historic city centre and is lined with bars and restaurants. The underwater search resumed this morning. Grim task: A police diver plunges into the Brda, where officers today found a body that is yet to be identified . Thorough: One of the divers under the surface. The investigation has been complicated by the fact Mr Nolan's friends had been drinking when he vanished . 'Mr Nolan's friends are of course . trying to help the police, but the problem is that it was a party night; . they don't remember exactly when it was that they last saw him. They . are trying to remember, but it's not very easy and so their information . is not very helpful so far,' Ms Chlebicz said. Mr . Nolan, of Blessington, County Wicklow, had travelled to the tournament . with friends in a rented camper van, but was also registered at a hotel . on the city's outskirts. He was last seen visiting local bars after . watching televised games in a fan zone on Saturday night. Ms Chlebicz said she is sure the missing Irishman has not left Poland nor traveled far from Bydgoszcz, because he had left his passport at the hotel and only had about 300 zlotys (£57) on him. A credit card he was carrying has not been used since his disappearance. 'We are hoping for a happy end to this situation, but right now we really don't know what has happened,' she said. In Ireland, Mr Nolan's parents were distraught with his father expecting a call from his son Sunday on Father's Day after speaking to him the previous day. 'If there's anything anybody can do, we'd really appreciate it,' Jimmy Nolan said during a TV interview with Irish state channel RTE. Fighting back tears, the father said: 'I know he's probably OK, but I mean, if anybody anywhere knows anything, please just let us know. Text us or ring us, or ring the Irish police'. He and his wife Essie appealed for Irish football fans who have remained in Poland after their team's exit from Euro 2012 to help search for their son. A Twitter campaign aimed at finding Mr Nolan, who studies environment engineering at Tallaght Institute of Technology in Dublin, was launched in Ireland with the hashtags #FindJames and #JamesNolan. Fears grow: This morning's find will fuel concerns for Mr Nolan's safety . Murky: A monitor shows the feed from an underwater camera as police continue a huge search across the city and its river .

The caption underneath referred to Balotelli's elbow against Ireland's Richard Dunne in his side's 2-0 win which went unseen by the match referee, the player's goal and then his foul mouthed outburst. It comes days before Sunday's Euro 2012 quarter-final clash with England, where Balotelli is likely to face, and possibly be 'wound up', by several of his Manchester City club teammates.

Verbal: Italy's Mario Balotelli is hushed up by team-mates Thiago Motta, Leonardo Bonucci and Federico Balzaretti after he scored his goal against Ireland . Ciani wrote: 'He comes commits a foul worthy of a red card, scores then unleashes a verbal onslaught against the bench forcing them to shut him up. 'This clown should go and work in the fields.' In Italy it is not uncommon to see immigrants from Africa or South America working in fields collecting vegetables in searing heat. There have been numerous complaints over conditions they have to endure. Ciani's comments immediately provoked controversy with many accusing him of blatant racism. It comes after UEFA launched an investigation against Croatian fans after they threw bananas at Balotelli and aimed monkey chants at him. Before the tournament started Manchester City striker Balotelli, who was born in Italy to Ghanaian immigrant parents, had vowed to walk off if he was racially abused.

So far he has stayed on the pitch. Ciani, based in Trieste in north east Italy, an area well known for its nationalism, immediately hit back at claims he was being racist and at those who had attacked him via Facebook. He posted a picture of himself at a council meeting with a black resident adding: 'How can they accuse me of racism. I work with non European Union nationals. 'This is the best response to this presumed racism.'

Alexander Thompson and William Press kicked and punched marines Martin Jones and Ray Simmons in a brutal and sustained attack following a booze-fuelled night out. The squaddies, from the Royal Logistic Corps in Wiltshire, were jailed for a total of 14 years for the 40 second unprovoked attack. Brutal: CCTV images capture the moment Alexander Thompson and William Press beat two Royal Marines outside a Plymouth nightclub . Police have now released footage of the attack which took place outside a Plymouth nightclub in December 2010. Thompson, 25, can be seen on the left of the CCTV footage and is filmed repeatedly punching and kicking marine Martin Jones who drops to his knees after the first blow. The soldier is seen launching at least seven kicks to the former Stonehouse-based commando, leaving him blind in one eye. At one stage Thompson is so frenzied and out of control he falls on his backside after kicking the commando with such force. Merciless: The sustained attack continues as Marines Martin Jones and Ray Simmons lay motionless on the floor . Meanwhile 26-year-old William Press is captured punching and kicking Ray Simmons. Mr Simmons, of 30 Commando fell to the floor after the first punch with father-of-one Press continuing the attack - breaking away just once to punch Mr Jones in the head. He then returns to Mr Simmons who is laid on the floor and resumes the violent assault. In one final kick, which Press himself described as 'disgusting', he boots Mr Simmons in the face and the marine immediately loses consciousness. Jailed: William Press (left) and Alexander Thompson were handed six and eight years in jail respectively for the brutal attack . Security officers place Mr Simmons in the recovery position as he lay on the floor. Mr Jones gets up with assistance from a passer by and immediately tends to his friend who is still on the ground. The assault prompted a judge to issue a stark warning to young men in Plymouth, Devon, 'looking for a fight'. Recorder . Geoffrey Still said: 'Twelve years imprisonment is the starting point . which from now on should be well known to young men in Plymouth looking . for a fight.' Thompson . and Press were found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm at Plymouth . Crown Court and were jailed for eight years and six years respectively. Ordeal: Ray Simmons lays motionless on the floor following a final kick to the head, when passers-by arrive to chase off Thompson and Press . Sentencing Thompson and Press, Geoffrey Still said: 'The aggravating factors of this case are self evident. 'One victim ended up having lost an eye and a badly broken up face, the other could have easily ended up the same way as he was kicked whilst unconscious and immobile.' He condemned the two soldiers for the 'alcohol and adrenaline fuelled' attack, adding the victims were 'defenceless' and at their 'mercy'. An Army spokesman said: 'In line with normal procedures, when a custodial sentence is awarded, the unit will usually apply for the discharge of the soldier or soldiers involved.'","CCTV footage shows brutal 40 second long attack carried out by Alexander Thompson and William Press .

Barack Obama’s signature healthcare reform, a sign that the ruling could . energise Republicans this November. In a message to supporters on Friday . morning, just over 24 hours after Chief Justice John Roberts had . delivered his majority opinion, the Romney campaign said it had raked in . $5.5million from 55,000 supporters. The campaign also touted Mr Romney's . social media presence, which they said underlined the fact that . Americans were mobilising against the Affordable Care Act – better known . as Obamacare – by backing the presumptive Republican nominee. Raising funds: Speaking yesterday with Capitol Hill as backdrop, presumptive presidential nominee Mitt Romney speaks out against 'Obamacare'; since the announcement, he raised an estimated $4million . Campaign spokesman Andrea Saul said: . ‘Governor Romney has also had more Facebook engagements and added more . than three times the amount of Facebook followers as President Obama, . despite President Obama starting with a Facebook list of over 27 million . people to our over 2 million people.’ The Obama campaign, which has sought . to project a high-minded message of ‘ordinary Americans are the . winners’, attacked Mr Romney’s staff for boasting about his fundraising . success. ‘It's perverse that Mitt Romney won't share details about what he'd do . for the millions he'd leave uninsured or at the whims of insurance . companies when he “kills Obamacare dead” but he'll share the hourly . details of his fundraising after the Supreme Court ruling,' said . spokesman Ben LaBolt. Stand your ground: Chief Justice John Roberts, who provided the crucial tipping vote, is being branded by some conservatives as a traitor . In his fundraising email to supporters, Mr Romney had said: ‘Today, the . Supreme Court upheld ObamaCare. But regardless of what the court said . about the constitutionality of the law, ObamaCare is bad medicine, it is . bad policy, and when I’m president, the bad news of ObamaCare will be . over.’ The former Massachusetts governor said the landmark ruling had injected . fresh impetus into the presidential contest. 'What happened yesterday . calls for greater urgency, I believe, in the election,' he told donors . in New York. 'I think people recognise that if you want to replace Obamacare you've . got to replace President Obama. And the urgency of doing that is . something which is galvanising people across the country.' The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Obamacare by a 5 to 4 . majority. Mr Romney has promised to repeal the measure if elected, . although he introduced a similar reform at the state level in . Massachusetts. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsuerg, a liberal, cited the . Massachusetts law in her opinion, writing: 'Congress followed . Massachusetts' lead.' Mr Obama also mentioned it in his address after . the decision was announced and is sure to raise it during the three . presidential debates in the autumn. The dramatic and historic Supreme Court decision represented a major . short-term victory for Mr Obama and a potential boost to his re-election . chances. Mr Roberts, appointed by President George W. Bush, enraged . conservative colleagues by siding with the court’s liberals. Official visit: President Obama waves as he boards Air Force One after the Supreme Court decision . Taking to the streets: Protestors have lined the Mall during the days leading up to Thursday's announcement . But the chief justice may have delivered a political sting in the tail . for Mr Obama by rejecting his lawyers’ argument that the mandate was . permissible under the constitution commerce clause and instead ruling . that Congress could levy fines for non-compliance as a tax. This enables Republicans to accuse Mr Obama of breaking an election . promise not to raise taxes – a potent attack line and one that sunk . President George H.W Bush in the 1992 election. In September 2009, Mr Obama told ABC News: ‘For us to say that you’ve . got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a . tax increase. ‘What it’s saying is, is that we’re not going to have other people . carrying your burdens for you anymore than the fact that right now . everybody in America, just about, has to get auto insurance. Nobody . considers that a tax increase.’ Hiding his happiness: President Obama addressed the Supreme Court ruling and while he did tout the benefits of the legislation, he also instilled the importance of moving past the issue . Republican response: Speaker of the House John . Boehner (left) and Majority Leader Eric Cantor (right) said that they . disagreed with the ruling and Mr Cantor announced a scheduled vote to . repeal on July 11 . WHO DOES IT AFFECT? The . decision affects nearly every American and marks a major milepost in a . century of efforts to make health care available to all. WILL ANYONE NOT BE COVERED BY IT? An . estimated 26 million people will remain without health coverage once . the law is fully implemented, including illegal immigrants, people who . don't sign up and elect to face the fine instead, and those who can't . afford it even with the subsidies. WHAT NOW? The . 2010 health care law will continue phasing in as planned. It's expected . to bring coverage to about 30 million uninsured people, so that more . than 9 in 10 eligible Americans will be covered. Some . parts are already in effect: Young adults can stay on their parents' insurance up to age 26. Insurers can't deny coverage to children with . health problems. Limits on how much policies will pay out to each person . over a lifetime are eliminated. Hundreds of older people already are . saving money through improved Medicare prescription benefits. And . co-payments for preventive care for all ages have been eliminated. WHAT'S NEXT? Starting . in 2014, almost everyone will be required to be insured or pay a fine. There are subsidies to help people who can't afford coverage. Most . employers will face fines if they don't offer coverage for their . workers. Newly created insurance markets will make it easier for . individuals and small businesses to buy affordable coverage. And . Medicaid will be expanded to cover more low-income people. Insurers . will be prohibited from denying coverage to people with medical . problems or charging those people more. They won't be able to charge . women more, either. During the transition to 2014, a special program for . people with pre-existing health problems helps these people get . coverage. An assortment of tax increases, health industry fees and Medicare cuts will help pay for the changes. IS THE ISSUE SETTLED NOW? Not . necessarily. Although the court found it constitutional, the health . care law still could be changed by Congress. Romney and Republican . congressional candidates are campaigning on promises to repeal it if . elected in November. ---The Associated Press . Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican chief whip of the House of . Representatives was one of first to rename Obamacare – initially a term . of conservative contempt but later embraced by the White House – . Obamatax. Mr Obama’s 2009 words denying his bill was a tax have already been . turned into an ‘Obamatax’ attack video by Ben Howe of the conservative . video company Mister Smith Media. Sarah Palin, the 2008 vice-presidential nominee and a Tea Party darling, . sent out a tweet saying: 'He said it wasn't a tax. Obama lies; freedom . dies.' Mr Romney immediately seized on the tax argument as a way of linking . healthcare to the ailing economy – the centrepiece of his election . strategy. He used the term Obamacare no fewer than 18 times. 'Obamacare was bad . policy yesterday,’ he said. ‘It's bad policy today. Obamacare was bad . law yesterday. It’s bad law today. Let me tell you why I say that. Obamacare raises taxes on the American people by approximately . $500billion.’ Mr Obama was visibly buoyed by the decision, which stunned official . Washington, which had been expecting the law to be struck down. He . sought to portray his pursuit of the reform, which had eluded presidents . for half a century, as a historic act of statesmanship. ‘It should be clear by now that I didn't do this because it was good . politics,' he quipped. ‘What the country can't afford to do is re-fight . the battles of two years ago. 'Today I'm as confident as ever that when we look back five years from . now, or ten years from now, or twenty years from now, we'll be better . off because we had the courage to pass this law and keep moving . forward.' Mr Romney, speaking close to the Supreme Court on Capitol Hill minutes before Mr Obama, said: 'I agree with the dissent. 'What the court did not do in its last day in session, I will do in my first day if elected President of the United States.’ Committing himself to repealing the healthcare law, he said: ‘Our . mission is clear - If we want to get rid of Obamacare, we're going to . have to replace President Obama.’ The dueling addresses and the stark policy differences ensured that . healthcare would be a key issue in the final four months of the election . campaign, probably second only to jobs. Justice Anthony Kennedy, normally considered the swing vote on the . court, sided with the three consistent conservatives Antonin Scalia, . Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito in opposing the decision. It was a major surprise that Mr Roberts aligned himself with the liberal . justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena . Kagan. Proud: Nancy Pelosi celebrated with staff during the moments after the ruling was announced . Was the Supreme Court right to uphold individual mandate in Obamacare? Although the White House had urged Democrats not to ‘spike the ball’ if . they prevailed before the court, many liberals were jubilant. Patrick Gaspard, executive director of the Democratic National . Committee, tweeted: ‘it's constitutional. Bitches'. Minutes later, he . added: ‘I let my scotus excitement get the better of me. In all . seriousness, this is an important moment in improving the lives of all . Americans.’ The Obama campaign sent out a tweet saying ‘Still a BFD’, a reference to . a remark by Vice President Joe Biden, caught by a microphone, that . healthcare reform was a ‘big f***ing deal’. The Obama campaign then . started selling $30 t-shirts that said: ‘Health Reform Still a BFD’. The Romney campaign branded the use of bad language ‘not presidential’ – . a move undermined somewhat by Romney ally Donald Trump sending out a . tweet that said: ‘Judge Kennedy should be proud of himself for sticking . to his principles, in light of Justice Roberts’ bulls***!’","Romney campaign donations rise after landmark decision .

"By . Ian Garland and Thomas Durante . UPDATED: . 07:08 EST, 3 July 2012 . A new search for missing aviator Amelia Earhart is all set to begin - just about 75 years to the day after she vanished while flying over the Pacific. A research team will set off for the remote island of Nikumaroro with some high-tech tools in hopes of establishing what happened to the legendary pilot when she vanished on July 2, 1937. It will be the tenth time in 23 years the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) will have searched the island for clues about Earhart's disappearance - but this time they'll be looking specifically for crash debris. Enduring riddle: American aviator Amelia Earhart, posing by her plane in Long Beach, California, in 1930, disappeared while flying over the Pacific in 1937 . Nikumaroro Island: Researchers will scour the island for clues and crash debris . Earhart, then 39, was on the final stage of an an ambitious around-the-world flight along the equator in a twin-engine Lockheed Electra when she and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared. The holder of several aeronautical records, including the first woman to cross the Atlantic by air, Earhart had set off from New Guinea to refuel at Howland Island for a final long-distance hop to California. In what turned out to be her final radio message, she declared she was unable to find Howland and that fuel was running low. Several search-and-rescue missions . ordered the next day by then-president Franklin Roosevelt turned up no trace of . Earhart or Noonan, who were eventually presumed dead at sea. Now, exactly 75 years after that search began, TIGHAR is launching one more, using underwater search equipment, which the organisation hopes will finally crack the mystery. One such gizmo listed on TIGHAR's website is a multi-beam sonar hull-mounted onto an expedition vessel to scan the sea floor for wreckage. High-tech: Some tools that will be utilised by TIGHAR include a multi-beam sonar hull-mounted onto an expedition vessel . Conspiracy theories about Earhart's final moments have flourished for years. One contended that Earhart was held by Japanese imperial forces as a spy. Another claimed she completed her flight, but changed her identity and settled in New Jersey. TIGHAR is operating under the hypothesis that the duo survived the crash, reached Gardner Island - which was then a British possession and now known as Nikumaroro - and managed to survive there for an unknown period of time. The group is scheduled to hold a dockside media event on Monday to mark 75 years since the doomed flight, before beginning the search at 8am on Tuesday. Nikumaroro, uninhabited in Earhart's time, and a mere 3.7 miles long by 1.2 miles wide, is about 300 miles southeast of Howland Island. Missing: Earhart and Fred Noonan, left, before they set off on their doomed flight. Right: Earhart as a young pilot . In TIGHAR's latest expedition, about 20 scientists will depart Hawaii to explore over 10 days both the island and an underwater reef slope at the west end of the island. 'This time, we'll be searching for debris . from the aircraft,' TIGHAR's founder and executive director Richard . Gillespie, himself a pilot and former aviation accident investigator, revealed last month. The team will be equipped with a multi-beam sonar to map the ocean floor, plus a remote-controlled device similar to the one that found the black boxes from the Rio-to-Paris Air France that crashed into the South Atlantic in 2009. If any debris is found, it will be photographed and its location carefully documented for a future expedition, Gillespie said. Celebrated: Earhart posing in Southampton after completing a successful flight across the Atlantic Ocean . Sustaining the search are clues . worthy of detective story, including items from the 1930s previously . discovered on the island such as a jar of face cream, a penknife blade, . the heel of a woman's shoe and a bit of Plexiglas - all believed to belong to Earhart and her plane. Skeletons of birds apparently cooked over a campfire have also contributed to the mystery, and settlers who reached Nikumaroro after 1937 have spoken of the existence of aircraft wreckage. Bone fragments have meanwhile been subjected to DNA testing that turned out to be inconclusive, said Gillespie, who remains hopeful that parts of Earhart's Electra are yet to be found. The U.S. government is lending technical and diplomatic support to the TIGHAR effort, budgeted at $2million and otherwise funded through donations and sponsorships through TIGHAR's website. Earhart's story - as well as her mysterious demise - have captivated America for decades. She has been portrayed on the big screen by A-List actresses like Diane Keaton, Amy Adams and Hillary Swank. Intrigue: In her day, Earhart was extremely popular, but her mysterious death has kept that fame alive 75 years later . The most widely accepted theory is that the aeroplane ran out of fuel and ditched in the sea. There have been several searches by many different professionals eager to solve the mystery, but none have been proven. Another popular theory is that they landed on the island of Nikumaroro in the Pheonix Islands, 350 miles southeast of Howland Island and fended for themselves for serveral months until they succumbed to injury or disease. Improvised tools and bits of Plexiglas that are consistent with that of an Electra window were found on the island. A few theorists reckon that she Earhart was spying on Japan and had been captured and executed. This theory has been discounted by the American authorities and press. A rumour claimed that she was one of many women sending messages on Tokyo Rose, an English-language Japanese propaganda station designed to attack the Allies' morale. An Australian aircraft engineer said he found a map that showed Earhart and Noonan may have turned round to try and refuel but crashed before getting to an airstrip. The most whacky theory is that she was still alive and had a different identity. A woman fron New Jersey successfully sued for $1.5m in damages from the author of a book who pursued this theory.","New search for the wreckage will start on July 3 - 75 years after the first search for Amelia Earhart began .

Tragic: Claire Peake, 39, was found hanged in her garage by her boyfriend, an inquest in Preston heard. She is pictured here at the Grand Canyon . A mother killed herself after becoming 'fixated' on An Officer And A Gentleman – the Hollywood hit which features a harrowing suicide scene. Claire Peake, 39, was found hanging in her garage by her partner Stuart Withnall on the evening they had been due to share a  Valentine's Day meal. An inquest heard how the primary school teacher had become overwhelmed with the thought of juggling work and caring for her newborn daughter. Just weeks before her death, she watched the 1982 film, starring Richard Gere and Debra Winger, with Mr Withnall. He told the inquest she became obsessed with the film, in which Gere plays Zack Mayo, a US Navy aviation officer candidate. It has a scene in which his best friend hangs himself after being rejected by his girlfriend. Mr Withnall told Preston Coroners Court: 'One night we watched An Officer and a Gentleman and I said, “That would be a horrible way to die” but she seemed fixated on the film.' The court heard that she had suffered from depression for almost a decade which appeared to worsen after she gave birth to her daughter Georgia in September last year. Mr Withnall, of Walton-le-Dale, Lancashire, said she wanted to return to work full-time but was worried she wouldn't be able to cope with being both a mother and a teacher. He said they decided she should return to work part-time. Following an interview she was offered a one-day-a-week job. However, the court was told she considered herself a failure if she did not return to work full-time. Mr Withnall said: 'I would look at her and she would look like she was slipping into a really anxious world. It was getting worse and worse. I was worried. 'She never explicitly said that she was going to take her own life. In my mind I didn't realise what she was saying until she actually died and I realised she was going.' He described Miss Peake as a 'fantastic teacher' with a loving family. Miss Peake's friend, Laura Rhodes, told the court that her friend hadn't alerted doctors to the severity of her depression because she feared they would take her baby away from her. She added: 'She felt that she was unable to go back to work full-time because she felt as though she couldn't cope and felt like she'd failed.' The court heard how Miss Peake had been given anti-depressants on and off since 2004. Movie love split: Officer Candidate Sid Worley with girlfriend Lynette Pomeroy who rejects him . She stopped taking medication while . pregnant but started taking it again in December. Two days before her . death her dosage was increased after she visited her GP in a tearful and . distressed state. Following her death, a note was found . her in pocket in which she said she was having 'dreadful thoughts'. Recording a verdict of suicide, Coroner Dr James Adeley said: 'The . evidence paints a picture of a young woman clearly very troubled. 'She was a loving parent with a newborn baby to whom she was quite clearly devoted. 'What Claire did on this day, she had . the intention to take her own life. I am very conscious of the fact that . Georgia has no mother and that is a tragedy.' Famous film: Richard Gere and David Keith, right, who plays Sid in An Officer and a Gentleman.

Ethnic minorities living in the UK feel more British than their white counterparts, new research has revealed. Muslims are the most likely of all groups to identify with the concept of 'Britishness', the Institute for Social and Economic Research study found. The report's authors say the results rubbish suggestions that ethnic groups are unwilling or unable to integrate into British society and show that fears over the negative impacts of immigration on cultural identity are considerably overstated. Patriots: Muslims most likely to identify with the concept of 'Britishness' according to the Institute for Social and Economic Research (file photo) The study, named Understanding Society, looked at the socio-economic circumstances of people living in 40,000 UK households. Occupants were asked a series of questions, including how important on a scale of one to 10, being British was to them. Pakistanis scored the highest with an average of 7.76 - despite common presumptions that they associate more strongly with their own national identity than to where they are living now. Research: The study found an identification with Britishness is higher among the children and grandchildren of migrants . Bangladeshi and Indian groups came second and third respectively, while the white population scored the lowest with an average of 6.58. The study also found that identification with Britishness is higher among the children and grandchildren of migrants. The research will be presented next week at the Economic and Social Research Council Research Methods Festival by Dr Alita Nandi. She said: 'There is a huge emphasis in public and policy discourse on immigration and its potential challenge to cultural homogeneity and national identity. 'Our research shows that people we might assume would feel very British, in fact do not - while others who we might assume would not associate themselves with feelings of Britishness, in fact do.' She added: 'Many people seem to manage dual identities, and it's interesting to note that in all the ethnic groups we looked at British identity increases from generation to generation, while within the majority white population many maintain strong non-British identities, such as Scots or Welsh.'","Children of migrants are more likely to identify with the concept of 'Britishness' than children of non-migrants .

A girl Goth who was battered by two drunken thugs in an attack echoing the chilling 'hate' murder of college student Sophie Lancaster watched her tomentors get a total of almost nine years in jail. Melody McDermott, 22, said she was robbed of her smile after she was headbutted, punched and repeatedly stamped upon as she stood on a tram carriage waiting to leave the station. Miss McDermott suffered a fractured eye socket and swelling to her face and body in the attack by two middle aged men on a Metrolink passenger tram near Bury, Greater Manchester. Targeted: Melody McDermott and Stephen Stafford outside Bolton Crown Court, where their attackers Gareth Farrar and Kenneth Kelsall were sentenced . Thugs: Gareth Farrar, left, and Kenneth Kelsall, right, have been sentenced to a total of almost nine years in prison . A friend Stephen Strafford, 29, who was with her, was punched twice and sustained a black eye and an ear injury in the attack. Thugs Kenneth Kelsall, 47, and 43-year old Gareth Farrar were suspected to have carried out the attack because the victim was wearing Gothic-like clothing. Miss McDermott later told police: 'Since this attack I have been left with a constant reminder of what these vile people did to me. 'I cannot smile properly and every time I do I can feel the muscle in my cheek which is not attached. 'Every time I touch my left eye but stings. Every morning when I wake up it is an immediate reaction, I am constantly reminded of it eight months after.' 'I have confidence because I feel there is a permanent reminder because of the effect of the left hand side of her face.

Kelsall (in black jacket) kicks Melody McDermott, 22, as she lies on the floor of the tram . 'Every time I meet new people I feels self conscious. I feel the attack has changed my personality. ' She said she had been left 'traumatised' and doesn’t go out in Bury after dark and always goes home early. The attack had chilling echoes of the killing in 2008 of Goth student Sophie, 20, who was beaten to death by two teenagers in a park in Bacup, Lancashire simply because of the long dark clothing she was wearing. Today, tattoeed Kelsall laughed in the dock as he was jailed for six years and nine months after he admitted causing grievous bodily harm with intent and assault. Farrar was jailed for two years two months after he admitted assault and affray after CCTV of the horrific assault was played at Bolton Crown Court. Both denied targeting the victims because of their clothing. Miss McDermott and Stephen watched from the public gallery as Judge Elliott Knopf told both men: 'It was an appalling explosion of violence on two young people. 'The public are extremely concerned by . the prominence of violence which can be found in our cities and towns . day in and day out. 'People . minding their own business could be subjected to vicious attacks for no . reason leaving them with injuries or serious injuries whether fuelled . by drink or another reason. Chilling echo: Sophie Lancaster, 20, who was killed by two youths because of the way she was dressed . 'It is a mark on our society which causes the greatest of concerns. In the case of both of you, you are in your forties and both of you are mature men. You should have been able to restrain yourself from the disgraceful conduct.' He added: 'We do not know what happened before that but one can see what may well have been an exchange of comments. 'Kelsall in response to perhaps something which was said or being said to you came across and head butted the young woman with such force that she was propelled across the width of the carriage she could be seen getting to her feet. 'She was upset that she had been assaulted in that way by a mature man and this shockingly horrific display of violence beggars belief. 'You Kelsall could not stop, you stamped on this young woman’s head with your boots and foot which caused the injuries. The effects of what you did must be distressing for her. 'Not only is it painful when she wakes up and throughout the day but she has lost her confidence because people notice and this has had the effect of changing her personality. 'This traumatic experience will stay with her for a long time to come.' Miss McDermott and Mr Strafford . were returning home from a night out in Bury in October last year and . were on board a tram at the Metrolink platform when they were attacked . by the two men. Kelsall headbutted Miss McDermott . inside the carriage, sending her reeling across the floor. She got up . and kicked out at the tram doors but Kelsall then bundled her into the . corner as other passengers looked on in horror. He repeatedly punched Melody and . viciously stamped on her head and face five times as she is lay between . two seats. Farrar thumped Mr Strafford and aimed two punches at Melody before running off. 'People like that should not be able to . get away with that sort of thing. I have lost my faith in society. It’s . had a giant impact on me.' Victim Melody McDermott . Mr Strafford required four stitches in his right ear lobe from an earing which had split. He had a right black eye and swollen lip. He later told police: 'I knew I had injuries but my main concern was for Miss McDermott. I am now extremely anxious about going out particularly if by myself. I totally avoid trams and buses and have noticed changes in Melody's personality.' Kelsall of Cheetham Hill, Manchester, had committed 77 previous offences between 1980 and 2010 including assaulting a police officer and public order matters. His counsel Laura Foster: 'He has been sickened watching the CCTV footage. He had had a drink and was intoxicated. He became aware of two people coming down the escalator saying 'tramp' and 'scumbag' and in response he pushed her. 'He accepts that he lost it. He bears no prejudice on people who are Goths or who dress in that way. He accepts his actions were beyond acceptable.' In mitigation for Farrar, of Beswick, Manchester, defence counsel Stuart Duke said: 'There is no doubt the two parties did not like the look of each other. But whatever was said that is not an excuse.' After the case Miss McDermott said: 'People like that should not be able to get away with that sort of thing. I have lost my faith in society. It’s had a giant impact on me. 'I still get quite nervy if it’s busy or dark. Watching the CCTV was difficult to take in.' Mr Strafford said: 'It is still a bit of a blur, I can’t understand the mentality of someone who would do something like this.'","Attack was chilling echo of 'hate' murder of Sophie Lancaster .

Lucky: The teenager suffered only bruises to her foot, arm and neck and says it was fortunate an off-duty medic was able to assist . Fortunately the daredevil wasn't injured in the leap and on the video a man is heard screaming 'don't jump, don't jump,' to those people still on the chairlifts. Rossomando says an off duty Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) came to her assistance. She said: 'Thank God for him, because if it wasn't for him I don't know what I would have done.' 'I'm not a calm person, I'm really not. I freaked out. You can hear in the video I was screaming bloody murder.' In the end she only suffered a sore arm, foot and neck. Her friend stayed on the lift until it was able to take her safely back to the entrance. Her father Peter said: 'That was her instinct with lightning all around her so we support that she did it, we are just glad she is okay.' The operators of the Casino Pier said the chair ride was in standby mode and no new passengers were being allowed on when the power went out. They said staff, following emergency procedures, evacuated the remaining riders and that they didn't know a passenger had jumped off until they saw the video Sunday. The chairlift takes riders above the beach and boardwalk, offering cool ocean breezes and views of MTV's 'Jersey Shore' house, among other things.","Teen jumped 35ft because she feared she would get hit by lightning .

Ballet thriller Black Swan received the most complaints in 2011 in large part because of its lesbian sex scene, the UK's ratings body has revealed. The film generated 40 objections to the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC), most of whom took a dislike to the raunchy interactions between Natalie Portman as Nina Sayers and fellow dancer Lily, played by Mila Kunis. Some described the scene as 'pornographic', but the BBFC said it came within the bounds of the film's 15 rating. 'Pornographic': This lesbian scene between Natalie Portman as Nina Sayers and Mila Kunis as Lily made Black Swan the most complained-about film of 2011, according to the UK ratings body's annual report . Disconnect: The British Board of Film Classification said other viewers complained that they had expected to see a film about ballet rather than 'the story of a young woman's mental disintegration' 'While the scene is visually discreet, narratively justified and within the 15 guidelines criteria, some correspondents felt it was pornographic in nature,' it said in its annual report. 'That it was a sex scene between two women was an aggravating factor for some who argued that portrayals of homosexual activity should either be restricted to the 18 category, or not shown at all.' Others complained that they had 'expected to see a film about ballet rather than the story of a young woman's mental disintegration', the BBFC said its annual report. The BBFC added: 'The high number of complaints for Black Swan demonstrates the disconnect that sometimes occurs between a viewer's expectations of a film and its actual content.' 'Gratuitous': Hanna (above), which features a genetically engineered 'super-soldier', received 29 complaints, the second-highest for 2011, over its perceived 'sadistic violence' 'Too raunchy': Sucker Punch (pictured), which charts the fantasies of a young woman committed to a mental institution, was condemned by 15 viewers for its sexual suggestiveness . But it said the number of complaints was far fewer than the 120 generated by horror The Woman in Black this year because of its 12A rating. The report was released as the BBFC announced it had commissioned major research into public perceptions of sexual violence in films - the first for ten years. The film generating the second-highest number of complaints last year was Hanna, which features a genetically engineered 'super soldier'. It received 29 objections from viewers who found the violence 'sadistic and gratuitous'. The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 garnered 16 complaints because of the storyline where heroine Bella and her vampire lover Edward, played by Robert Pattinson, marry and consummate their relationship. Objections: Robert Pattinson as vampire Edward and Kristen Stewart as his lover Bella in Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - part 1, which generated 16 complaints from viewers . Sucker Punch, which charts the fantasies of a young woman committed to a mental institution, was condemned by 15 viewers for its sexual suggestiveness and threats targeted at female characters. The BBFC said it refused to grant a certificate for The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence) because of its horrific plot where a man achieves sexual gratification from the stapling together of victims to form a human centipede. But it was later rated 18 after editing. The Bunny Game - which sees a truck driver abduct and sexually abuse and tortures a prostitute - was refused a certificate. It was as a result of those two films that the BBFC decided to commission new research into 'depictions of sadistic, sexual and sexualised violence, mainly against women'. The body said it wanted to determine what the British public today believes is potentially harmful and therefore unacceptable for classification. The research will be completed later this year.","Oscar-winning movie generated 40 objections in 2011 .

Stevens, who married just last month, had performed in more than 170 films and was nominated for . industry awards. She was also a pioneer of the niche genre, clown porn. Passed: Porn star Hollie Stevens has died aged 30 after a 18-month battle with cancer that spread from her breast to her bones, ribs, liver and brain. She was best known for her work in clown porn . But before her death, she said she hoped to be remembered as a good wife and friend rather than for her professional accomplishments. 'I hope people know I’m always myself.

'I noticed it and paid attention to it, but going to the doctor is hard when you don't have insurance,' she had said. Her friends, family and fans rallied around her, raising $16,000 for her medical bills. 'I cannot believe how many people care, how good my fans are, and how . much complete strangers have helped me,' she said of the donations. 'This is unreal. Not everyone . hates clowns after all!' Among those heading the . fundraising campaign was dominatrix January Seraph, who asked . clients to donate money in return for extra time in sessions with her.

'Show Hollie that she's loved and appreciated in her time of need. Because no one should feel alone when they are ill.' But in December 2011, the cancer was found to have spread to her bones.

A jealous husband who shot his wife five times with an illegal firearm after learning of her secret affair with a younger man was today jailed for 12 years. David Leeman, 60, shot Jennie, 44, with a semi-automatic pistol at close range in a barn on the farm they once shared in rural Devon. Their marriage was already on the rocks when Mrs Leeman, who had two sons and two daughters with the defendant during a 20-year relationship, started seeing another man, Norman Laramy, 40. Guilty: David Leeman, left, has been jailed for shooting his wife Jennie with a a semi-automatic pistol . Leeman discovered the couple’s affair six days before he killed Mrs Leeman, Exeter Crown Court heard. He said he heard voices in his head in the moments leading up to the death. Leeman admitted manslaughter on the grounds of a 'loss of control' because he was taking anti-depressants at the time, which he said had an impact on his thought process. Senior medical professionals were divided on whether the dosage Leeman was taking was sufficient to cause his behaviour on the day he shot his wife. It took the jury nine and a half hours to acquit the property developer, of Higher Cowley Farm, Parracombe, near Barnstaple, north Devon, of murder but guilty of manslaughter. Crime scene: The incident happened at the couple's home - Higher Cowley Farm in Parracombe, in Devon . Passing sentence, Mr Justice Butterfield said he was 'wholly unimpressed' with the evidence that Leeman had been affected by the prescription medication he was taking at the time. 'You have been convicted of the manslaughter of your wife and you have pleaded guilty to the possession of a prohibited weapon, a semi-automatic pistol,' the judge said. 'There is no evidence that you were violent towards your wife until the day you killed her and indeed no evidence that you threatened her with violence. 'You were convicted of manslaughter and you had in fact pleaded guilty to that offence once it was added to the indictment. 'You killed your wife without any justification. Your conviction for manslaughter is on the basis that when you killed your wife you had lost your self-control. 'This was a terrible tragedy. It is a tragedy for Jennie Leeman, whose life you took, and for her family. 'A precious life has been needlessly lost and the sentence I am about to impose is in no sense a value of that life. 'Her life was precious and you have taken it from her. Sad: The court hear the couple's marriage was already on the rocks when Mrs Leeman, started seeing another man, Norman Laramy, 40. Pictured the front gate to the family home. 'But my sentence is also informed from my view of the evidence placed before the jury and my assessment of what happened that terrible day. 'It is clear that in the days before the killing you learned that your wife was going to leave you and make a new life with Mr Laramy. 'You loved her and accepted the situation as best you could. It is evidently clear that you became concerned about Mr Laramy upon hearing of the rumours and what your son had told you. 'You became obsessed with the view that Mr Laramy was a paedophile and that your young daughter was going to live with your wife. 'It was false in the extreme but I am satisfied it was a view you genuinely held.' The judge said Leeman had not lost his self-control when he took the handgun from its hiding place, cleaned it, loaded it and placed it in his pocket to meet his wife on the day he killed her. 'In my view you had probably intended to threaten your wife,' he said. 'You were not out of control when you recovered the gun, you were not out of control when you cleaned it and you were not out of control when you put it in your pocket. Happier time: Pictured Mrs Leeman. The judge said it was clear that in the days before the killing Mr Leeman learned that his wife was going to leave him and make a new life with Mr Laramy . 'You took out the loaded gun and pointed it at her. You were not, in my judgment, out of control even though you were in a highly charged emotional state. 'But she laughed at you and you did lose control and pumped five bullets into her at point blank range.' The judge said that had Leeman been convicted of murder the starting point would have been 30 years in prison. 'In my judgment the degree of provocation was low and your wife presented no threat to you,' he said. 'You acted out of anger and frustration rather than fear. It is clear that your intention when you discharged that weapon was to kill your wife. 'I take into account your conduct immediately after you killed your wife, your lack of previous convictions for violence and your remorse, although how much of that is self-pity is difficult to assess.' Leeman showed no emotion as he was told he would serve a 12-year sentence for manslaughter to run concurrent with a five-year term for possessing the gun. The judge explained that the 296 days Leeman had already served in custody would be taken into account and he would spend half the sentence in prison before being released on licence. In mitigation, Martin Meeke QC told the judge of Leeman’s genuine remorse. 'We cannot add to the facts of the case but we would like to emphasise the defendant’s evidence, the intention to commit suicide and, of course, his comments made to the police, which were of loving his wife, wanting to die and wanting to be with her,' he said. 'We say it was immediate and genuine remorse.' The trial heard that Mrs Leeman and Mr Laramy started their affair in June last year, having known each other for three years. The following month, Mr Laramy, a builder, moved into a converted barn at the Leemans’ farm and continued seeing Mrs Leeman. When the defendant found out about his wife’s affair, she left their home and moved in with Mr Laramy. Six days later, she was dead. The jury of seven men and five women were told that Mrs Leeman was killed at around 5.30pm on September 18, all five of the shots being fired from close range, with the last two at a distance of less than 1in (2.5cm). Jurors were told Mrs Leeman had gone to the farm, accompanied by Mr Laramy and two of his children, to return her young daughter to her father.Leeman asked his wife to accompany him to his office for a two-minute chat and they were then seen walking towards a barn. Mr Laramy then heard raised voices, Mrs Leeman screaming and then gunshots, the court was told. Tragic: The trial heard that Mrs Leeman and Mr Laramy started their affair in June last year, having known each other for three years . Geoffrey Mercer QC, prosecuting, said: 'She went with him into the barn and in fact to her death, unaware he had a loaded gun with him. 'Mr Laramy heard arguing and screaming, then a gunshot and then further gunshots.' The court heard that Mr Laramy told his two sons to run to a neighbouring house to raise the alarm and he then ran to the barn. As he did so, the defendant came out of the barn with the gun in his hand. The jury heard that Leeman pointed the gun at Mr Laramy and said: 'It should have been you first.' The court was told that Leeman wanted to speak to his wife because of unfounded rumours that Mr Laramy was a paedophile. When Leeman was arrested, he told police: 'I did it. She would just not listen. 'I shot the woman I loved because she didn’t do what I wanted.' He also told the court he said the Lord’s Prayer over his wife’s limp body, before trying to kill himself, though the weapon had no further ammunition. Members of Mrs Leeman’s family were not in court to see her husband jailed although they attended the trial. Yesterday, a spokesman for her family said: 'No-one has the right to take another person’s life. 'We, Jennie’s family, feel disappointed and that justice has not been done for such a terrible thing that David Leeman has done to our wonderful daughter, sister and friend to so many people.'","Couple had been married for 20 years and had two children .

The woman victim told police she was raped while out sleep-walking in Ruislip, north London (pictured posed by model) A sleepwalker was raped when she wandered out of a friend’s home in her nightclothes after a dinner party. Detectives are investigating the attack on the 48-year-old woman on a street in Ruislip, West London. The victim told specialist investigators she was accosted and raped  after she decided to stay overnight following a dinner party with friends. The woman, believed to be a child carer, suffers from the sleep disorder somnambulism and has sleepwalked at night before. A source said she went to bed around midnight but appears to have let herself out of the house before being targeted by the attacker. He told the London Evening Standard: ‘She suffers from somnambulism which means that she sometimes sleepwalks in the middle of the night. ‘She was at a friend’s house and apparently she went out of the house in Ruislip and walked around the streets, unaware of what she was doing.’ Officers from Scotland Yard’s Sapphire unit – set up to improve confidence among victims and catch more rapists – are investigating the offence. They have taken DNA samples and other forensic evidence from the woman in the hope of matching it with known offenders on their databases. They are also hunting for CCTV footage from the area around the attack, which took place at about 4am on June 27. It is also understood that specialist rape counsellors and detectives have interviewed the victim. The Metropolitan Police confirmed that detectives were investigating ‘an allegation of sexual assault’ and that forensic investigations were ongoing. Police have said they are investigating the rape but are not even sure where exactly the attack happened and said officers from Operation Sapphire were investigating . A spokesman said: ‘We are not prepared to give many details of this incident to protect the vulnerable victim . ‘Because of the circumstances in . which it happened, we are not even sure where the sex attack happened – . at this stage we are just saying Ruislip. ‘We are giving very few details of . this case because we are most anxious nothing should be published which . might identify this woman.’ The Sapphire sex crime unit has been rocked by a series of scandals as it battles to win back the support of victims. One detective has been accused of falsifying documents and another faces claims of misconduct over the standard of his work. In 2001, a landlord who raped his teenage tenant after she came into his bedroom while sleepwalking was jailed for seven years. Iranian Muslim Abbas Dadgarnejad, . then aged 38, was branded ‘despicable’ for taking advantage of the . 19-year-old Danish girl at his flat in Central London. The Old Bailey heard the girl had a history of sleepwalking and went to bed with her fiancé but woke up with her landlord.","Attack took place on a street in Ruislip, West London .

A world renowned children's heart doctor has withdrawn from a disciplinary hearing into allegations he sexually abused young boys. Philipp Bonhoeffer is alleged to have committed the abuse against several boys under the age of 16 during visits to Kenya with the medical charity Chain of Hope. But with a hearing set to start on September 3, the former head of cardiology at Great Ormond Street children's hospital has broken off all contact with the General Medical Council (GMC). The GMC has been told he will not attend the hearing and will not be legally represented, meaning he will relinquish his right to cross-examine a key witness in the case. If found guilty at the hearing, he could be struck off the medical register. Chain of Hope provides treatment to children in the developing world who have serious heart problems. As well as chairing its medical board, Professor Bonhoeffer sponsored a number of youths in Kenya. The GMC alleges that the professor 'abused his position  of trust when he behaved in a way which was sexually motivated, inappropriate, and misleading towards several boys under 16' during his work with the charity. It also alleges that he provided gifts and financial support to other children and young adults and organised for them to stay with him. The GMC also alleges that he contacted the key witness - Witness A - and attempted to persuade them to withdraw the allegations. The 50-year-old strongly denies all of the allegations against him. The case against Professor Bonhoeffer was opened by the GMC in October 2010. Because of the seriousness of the allegations against him, and because . his work gave him access to children, he was suspended from the medical . register pending its outcome. Withdrawn: With a hearing set to start on September 3, the former head of cardiology at Great Ormond Street children's hospital has broken off all contact with the General Medical Council. The hospital is pictured . He won an appeal last year against the GMC nine months after it had opened its case against him. He claimed the GMC's plan to rely on hearsay evidence from Witness A would prevent him from getting a fair trial.

Record numbers of pensioners are working, but the number of young people searching for a job for more than six months has also hit an all-time high, official figures revealed yesterday. The figures highlight the problems facing Britain’s troubled labour market as pensioners are forced to keep on working because of a lack of money, but young people cannot find work. Nearly one million pensioners have jobs, but nearly 500,000 under-24s want one but cannot find one, according to the Office for National Statistics. Good and bad: Despite a drop in unemployment the numbers claiming jobseeker's allowance is up, particularly among women . Neil Duncan-Jordan, from the National . Pensioners’ Convention, said: ‘A lot of our members are keen that their . grandchildren can get a job. ‘They think the young deserve a chance, but they worry they are not going to get one. ‘As the state pension age rises, we . will be making the old work for longer but keeping the young on . unemployment benefits, which is a ridiculous way to do things.’ The ONS said there were 929,000 . over-65s working, the largest number since records began 20 years ago. Between March and May, an extra 565 people every day joined Britain’s . army of older workers as baby boomers, born after the end of the Second . World War, realised they did not want – or could not afford – to stop . work. But the ONS figures highlight chronic problems at the other end of the age spectrum. The number of young people between the . age of 16 and 24 who have been looking for a job for more than six . months has jumped by 30 per cent over the past year. Howevwer, in the past quarter it has fallen 10,000 on the quarter. Of those, the number of young people out of education and seeking work is now 724,000 and the number of full time students looking for a job is 299,000. Olympic boost: London jobs market shows an improvement ahead of the Games that has helped boost unemployment figures released today . In total, 489,000 young people have fallen into this trap which is also the highest number since records began in 1992. Paul Brown, director of the youth . charity The Prince’s Trust, said: ‘There are now more long-term . unemployed young people in the UK than ever before, with hundreds of . thousands feeling they will spend their lives on the scrapheap. ‘We need to focus on supporting the most vulnerable young people, who are being pushed to the back of the dole queue. ‘If we invest in young people now, we can save the state billions in benefits and lost productivity.’ The figures come after the Government . scrapped the default retirement age last year which means bosses can no . longer kick out a worker simply because they have reached 65. As the state pension age is increased, . the trend of people working beyond the age of 65 will continue. The . state pension age will reach 67 in 2028, and will continue to rise. Evidence from Portugal, which raised its State pension age from 62 to 65 . for women in 1993, proves that it triggers problems for young people. Research from the Institute for the . Study of Labour concluded: ‘Firms hire approximately one fewer worker . for each older worker that is retained due to the higher mandatory . retirement age. ‘We also find that younger workers . and, in particular, younger women are the demographic groups most . affected by the lower level of total hirings.’ Overall, ministers yesterday welcomed a drop in unemployment, which fell by 65,000 between March and May to 2.58million. But economists said the figure was . skewed by a large drop in London after a hiring spree triggered by . temporary events such as the Olympics and the Diamond Jubilee . celebrations. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Iain Duncan Smith said: 'The previous Government’s approach to employment programmes meant young people were put onto schemes that took them off the unemployment register, but when they left the schemes many went straight back onto benefits. 'Resetting the clock so that young people weren’t counted as long-term unemployed didn't help them get a job - they were still unemployed whatever the official statistics said. 'We have stopped this nonsense and it is only Liam Byrne who persists with the notion that these young people were in jobs. 'We have challenged the opposition to come clean and stop playing fast and loose with the facts, but no one will be surprised that they haven't responded.'","Unemployment down to 2.58m - lowest since almost 12 months .

DJs Annie Mac (left) and Grandmaster Flash (right) are due to play sets during the House Party screened on Channel 4 . The show is to be free of adverts and interruptions and will be broadcast without commentary, the Independent reported. Partygoers will be able to request tunes like they would in a real club, only via social media rather than shouting across the dancefloor. The House Party event is also due to feature 'visual sets' - works by computer animators, graphic artists and video jockeys responding to the music being played. The show will air from midnight on the evening of August 24 and run until 6am. And anyone planning to watch it will have to stay up, for the show will neither be repeated nor made available on Channel 4's replay service, 4 on Demand. Club culture: The Channel 4 show will mark the 20th anniversary of a free rave at Castlemorton, near Malvern, Worcestershire . Twenty years ago: Police check buses arriving in Castlemorton in 1992. The illegal rave was attended by 40,000 revellers . The 1992 rave at Castlemorton Common began when revellers set up their own impromptu site after police tried to end the Avon Free Festival. The gathering lasted a week, attracting thousands more people, and authorities found it difficult to close it safely. In its aftermath, the Tory government drew up legislation to bring an end to any more large illegal festivals. The House Party night will begin with a two-hour documentary, hosted by Luther actor Idris Elba, exploring how clubbing has grown into a multinational business. Former Home Secretary Michael Howard, Black Eyed Peas star Will.i.am and DJs Pete Tong, Armand van Helden and Paul Oakenfold are to be interviewed for the documentary.

Channel 4 arts commissioner Tabitha Jackson told the newspaper that 2012 was the 'perfect summer' for the event. She added: 'Perhaps the most radically innovative element of the night is that, in direct contrast to the new on-demand TV landscape, House Party is a genuine one-off. 'It will not be repeated and it will not be available on 4oD. 'Like all the best club nights and parties if you want to be there you have to turn up.'

A one-man business is facing the wrath of the BBC over the name of his property maintenance and repairs service. The corporation has complained to Terry Jacobs that the name, Tel’s DIY SOS, could damage the reputation of its home renovation show, DIY SOS. BBC executives wrote to Mr Jacobs and insisted that he change it or face ‘further action’. Damaging: The BBC has told Terry Jacobs (pictured) to change the name of his firm, Tel's DIY SOS, because it is too similar to the corporation's show DIY SOS . Mr Jacobs, 56, who has been visiting customers in and around Bracknell, Berkshire, for seven years, said: ‘No one has ever said to me “Are you something to do with the DIY programme on the telly?” ‘If I was a multi-million pound company I could understand, but it seems they have nothing better to do than pick on a small man.’ Mr Jacobs from Warfield, Bracknell, will now remove ‘SOS’ from the name displayed on his van. The show, which is presented by Nick Knowles, follows a team of tradesmen as they transform near-derelict homes and has been on air since 1999. 'Picking on the small man': Mr Jacobs will remove the 'SOS' from the name . However, since 2010 the show has been extended to an hour and is now called 'DIY SOS - The Big Build'. Nevertheless, BBC executives wrote to Mr Jacobs and insisted that he change the name of his business or face further action. Mr Jacobs, who has been visiting customers in and around Bracknell, Berkshire, for the last seven years, said he got the letter on July 9. He now has 21 days to formally make the change and notify the BBC. 'It seems they have nothing better to do than pick on a small man,' said Mr Jacobs, from Warfield, Bracknell. Protecting the brand: DIY SOS, which is presented by Nick Knowles (third left), follows a team of tradesmen as they transform near-derelict homes and has been on air since 1999 . 'No-one has ever said to me 'Are you something to do with the DIY programme on the telly?'. 'If I was a big multi-million pound company I could understand, but it just seems a little bit pathetic. 'They are trying to say they own 'DIY SOS' and are telling me to change the name because it is their brand name. 'I was aware of the programme but I thought of the name as I'm not just a painter and decorator. I never gave it (the programme) a thought. 'They have stated in the letter if I don't alter the name and change it in writing they will take it further.' To comply with the BBC's request, Mr Jacobs, who only uses his van to advertise his business, will remove 'SOS' from the name. A BBC spokesman said: ‘The BBC works actively to protect both its reputation and the goodwill in its programme titles. This is to avoid any confusion among the public that those goods or services are either connected to or endorsed by the BBC.’","Sole trader Terry Jacobs has firm called Tel's DIY SOS .

"By . Liz Hull . PUBLISHED: . 04:25 EST, 11 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:30 EST, 11 July 2012 . Staggered: Lesley Cherry came back from holiday to find she was wanted by police . A mother came back from holiday to find she was wanted by police – over her garden decking. Lesley Cherry was staggered to find a warrant had been issued for her arrest because she had failed to get planning permission for the wooden verandah. And while she was away council workers had demolished the ‘unneighbourly’ decking on the back of her £350,000 home, leaving her garden like a building site. A note put through Mrs Cherry’s letter box warned: ‘You are now circulated as wanted on the police national computer – failure to contact could result in your immediate arrest.’ Mrs Cherry, a mother of three, said: ‘I was gobsmacked when I found out about the warrant. You would think, given what has happened, that I was some master criminal, not a householder who’s made a mistake with the planning permission. ‘I’ve never been in trouble in my life and I’ve never even stepped foot in a court. ‘I think this is pathetic that it has got so far. The council have been heavy-handed jobsworths. All this for a bit of decking. It’s nonsense.’ In November, Mrs Cherry, 46, and her husband Simon, 42, decided to put up a decked viewing area on the back of their house in Stockport, as their steeply sloping garden meant their children wanted somewhere flat to play. The decking, which cost £4,500, also let the couple enjoy the surrounding countryside. But they failed to apply for planning permission and neighbours complained the decking let them look directly into their gardens and homes. Karen Hillen, prosecuting, told magistrates in Stockport: ‘It was a considerable and substantial decking area. Mrs Cherry, from Stockport, was told a warrant had been issued . for her arrest and her details were on the police national computer . 'The officer was satisfied that planning permission was needed and had not been applied for  and it was likely that would be unneighbourly. ‘It caused serious overlooking of the adjacent garden and looked into the adjacent rear bedrooms.’ In December, Stockport council ordered the couple to remove the decking – which, at more that 12 inches off the ground, breached strict planning rules – by March. But the couple, who are in the process of getting divorced, failed to do so. Outdoor living: Lesley Cherry's decking under construction in her back garden. The council tore it down and sent her a £1,500 bill for its removal . Measure: Stockport council said the decking was 'completely unneighbourly' because it was raised more than 30cm above the ground . They claimed to have ‘too much on their plate’ after burglars broke into their home and stole  thousands of pounds worth of electrical goods. They also missed a court hearing last month, where warrants were issued for their arrest. Yesterday the couple appeared in court and were fined almost £1,450 after pleading guilty to failing to comply with an enforcement notice which required they take the decking down. They were also told to pay £437 costs and face a further £1,500 bill from the local authority for the cost of removing the decking. Mr Cherry, who runs a car security business, had responded to the warrant, which was withdrawn before yesterday’s proceedings. Mrs Cherry and husband Simon, 41, had put up decking without planning permission . He said: ‘We had no idea when we set up the decking that it would be infringing the planning policy. ‘Unfortunately, we had a lot on our plate which meant that we couldn’t get anything done in time. The council just came and took it down. ‘I accept that it does overlook next door’s garden, there is no dispute in that. ‘He saw us putting it up and then made a complaint because we didn’t put fencing up. ‘With the break-in and the divorce which we are going through it was just one of those things.’ Councillor Iain Roberts, of Stockport Council, said that officials had made several attempts to contact the Cherrys to get  them to comply with the enforcement notice. He added: ‘As the harm caused by the development was so severe, we had no option other than to carry out the steps required by the notice.’ Order: Mrs Cherry was told that failure to contact the warrants office could result in her immediate arrest .","Lesley Cherry, 46, was issued with arrest warrant while on holiday .
